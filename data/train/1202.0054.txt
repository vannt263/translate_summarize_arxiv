    "the excitement of particle physics in the year 2011 was the hunt for the higgs boson , the higgs boson of any model , in particular that of the standard model ( sm ) at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the recent data in the summer 2011 @xcite , showed an approximately @xmath4 excess in the channel @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) above the expected sm backgrounds .",
    "the excess is consistent with a higgs boson of mass about 140 gev but with a somewhat smaller production rate of @xmath5 than the sm one .",
    "however , in december 2011 both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite announced possible hints of excess in @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 channels that are consistent with a sm - like higgs boson in the mass range of @xmath7 gev ; and at the same time rule out a sm higgs boson above 131 gev up to about 600 gev . except for the @xmath14 channel",
    "almost all channels are slightly suppressed relative to the sm cross sections at around @xmath7 gev . note that these results consist of large errors . in this work ,",
    "we consider two mass ranges , @xmath17 and @xmath18 gev , for the sm - like higgs boson of the @xmath0-extended minimal supersymmetric standard model ( umssm ) .",
    "we will entertain these two ranges in the supersymmetry ( susy ) framework , because the current data are still premature to definitely confirm a higgs boson , not to mention its mass .",
    "supersymmetric models in general predicts a light higgs boson , mostly below about 150 gev . in particular , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) predicts a light higgs boson with @xmath19 gev .",
    "thus , a higgs boson heavier than 130 gev significantly constrains the parameter space of the mssm , forcing the sfermions masses to exceed the tev range , and consequently susy loses somewhat of its appeal .",
    "it is then more natural to consider extensions to the mssm if the light higgs boson is heavier than 130 gev , and to hide this higgs boson by suppressing its branching ratio into visible modes .",
    "it is well known that by adding singlet higgs field can easily raise the higgs boson mass .",
    "recent attempts to raise the higgs boson mass in susy frameworks can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , and attempts to hide such a light higgs boson heavier than 130 gev in the current data can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the sm - like higgs boson falls in the mass range of @xmath7 gev and future data may further support that , this higgs boson should decay into visible particles , almost in the same pattern as the sm higgs boson , though the current data @xcite showed a slightly enhancement to the @xmath14 mode while slightly suppression to the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath1 modes .",
    "recent attempts interpreting the @xmath7 gev higgs boson in susy framework can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to give a @xmath7 gev higgs boson within mssm , the stop sector must consist of a very heavy stop , a large mixing , and a relatively light stop , which has an interesting implication to collider phenomenology .",
    "however , within the mssm it is rather difficult to enhance the @xmath14 production rate but easier in some other extensions like the randall - sundrum scenario @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "it is therefore timely to investigate an extension of mssm , which involves an extra @xmath0 symmetry and a higgs singlet superfield @xmath20 .",
    "the scalar component of the higgs singlet superfield develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , which breaks the @xmath0 symmetry and gives a mass to the @xmath0 gauge boson , denoted by @xmath21 . at the same time",
    ", the vev together with the yukawa coupling can form an effective @xmath22 parameter from the term @xmath23 in the superpotential , thus solving the @xmath24 problem of mssm ( the same as the nmssm @xcite ) .",
    "existence of extra neutral gauge bosons had been predicted in many extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "string - inspired models and grand - unification ( gut ) models usually contain a number of extra @xmath25 symmetries , beyond the hypercharge @xmath26 of the sm .",
    "the exceptional group @xmath11 is one of the famous examples of this type .",
    "phenomenologically , the most interesting option is the breaking of these @xmath25 s at around tev scales , giving rise to an extra neutral gauge boson observable at the tevatron and the lhc . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we considered a scenario of @xmath0 symmetry breaking at around tev scale by the vev of a higgs singlet superfield in the context of weak - scale supersymmetry .",
    "the @xmath21 boson obtains a mass from the breaking of this @xmath0 symmetry and proportional to the vevs .",
    "such a @xmath21 can decay into the susy particles such as neutralinos , charginos , and sleptons , in addition to the sm particles .",
    "thus , the current mass limits are reduced by a substantial amount and so is the sensitivity reach at the lhc @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we turn our focus to the higgs sector in umssm , which consists of 3 cp - even higgs bosons , 1 cp - odd higgs boson , and one pair of charged higgs bosons . because of",
    "the extra singlet higgs superfield the mass of the lightest higgs boson is raised by a substantial amount , easily to be above 130 gev . however , for such a heavy higgs boson , we have to hide it under the current data because the sm higgs boson is ruled out for above 141 gev @xcite . in umssm",
    ", there is an invisible decay mode of the sm - like higgs boson into a pair of lightest neutralinos .",
    "we shall show that there are substantial parameter space that it is possible to hide the sm - like higgs boson in this manner . on the other hand ,",
    "if the sm - like higgs boson lies in the lower mass range @xmath27 gev , we can find the parameter space that this sm - like higgs boson decays in a manner similar to the sm higgs boson , i.e. , the decay branching ratios into @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath1 are all similar to the sm values .",
    "so what are the differences between the umssm and the other ones such as the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) ? there are a number of extensions to the mssm by adding a higgs singlet superfield depending on the different extra terms of the singlet in the superpotential ( such as @xmath28 of the nmssm ) .",
    "however , these extensions often predict a light cp - odd higgs boson in addition to the usual mssm - like cp - odd higgs boson , such that the sm - like higgs boson decays dominantly into this light cp - odd higgs boson .",
    "in such a way , the branching ratios into @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath1 diminish to negligible values , and so can not explain the excess seen at the lhc .",
    "the point here is that not all higgs - singlet extensions to the mssm can account for the excess at the lhc , although most of them can raise the higgs boson to the desirable value .",
    "the umssm , on the other hand , only has one cp - odd higgs boson , which is mssm - like .",
    "we organize the paper as follows .",
    "in the next section , we describe the model briefly and work out the mass matrix of the cp - even higgs bosons . in sec .",
    "iii , we list the formulas for the couplings of the cp - even higgs bosons that are most relevant to our study . in sec .",
    "iv , we search for the parameter space in the model that can have a sm - like higgs boson in the two mass ranges of ( i ) @xmath18 gev and ( ii ) @xmath17 gev , and show the branching ratios into @xmath15 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we discuss and conclude in sec .",
    "for illustration we use the popular grand unified models of @xmath11 , which are anomaly - free .",

    "this feature is similar to the other mass range @xmath18 gev : when @xmath143 is large the invisible mode becomes more important .",
    "therefore , the current lhc data prefers a smaller @xmath143 if the sm - like higgs boson falls in the mass range of @xmath17 gev .",
    "another feature of the current lhc data showed that the production rate of the higgs boson into diphotons is slightly larger than that of the sm higgs boson @xcite .",
    "however , one has to be careful that the current data consists of large statistical uncertainties , and the data are consistent either with the presence of the sm higgs boson or without any higgs boson . it has been shown in a number of recent works that in mssm @xcite or nmssm @xcite the production rate of diphotons is similar to that of the sm higgs boson , mostly slightly smaller than the sm one , though at some points in the parameter space it could be slightly larger .",
    "nevertheless , under some less restrictive conditions the production rate of diphotons may be enhanced by up to a factor of 2 in the nmssm @xcite . here",
    ", we do not expect the umssm can give a dramatic change in diphoton production rate , as long as the sm - like higgs boson does not decay into the lightest neutralinos .",

    "[ fig4 ] ( first and second column ) . in this case",
    ", the production rate into diphotons would not be any different from the mssm predictions , because the gluon - fusion is very similar and so is the decay into diphotons , except for a slight singlet component in the higgs boson couplings .",

    "_ if the sm higgs boson falls in the mass range of larger than 130 gev , it would be inconsistent with the current data @xcite .",
    "the umssm , on the other hand , can allow the sm - like higgs boson in this mass range to decay invisibly into the lightest neutralinos , such that it can hide from the current data",
    ". the sm - like higgs boson in the umssm can also accommodate in the lighter mass range of @xmath17 gev with the decay branching ratios very similar to those in the sm .",
    "_ comparison with the mssm .",
    "_ the low energy spectrum of umssm has an extra cp - even higgs boson and two more neutralinos .",
    "we have shown that the sm - like higgs boson is most of the time the second lightest higgs boson while the lightest one is more singlet - like .",
    "the singlet - like neutralino can be substantially lighter than the mssm lightest neutralino , such that the sm - like higgs boson can decay invisibly more frequently once this mode is open , but not quite so in the mssm .",
    "_ comparison with the nmssm .",
    "_ in terms of particle content , the major differences between umssm and nmssm include    * nmssm has two pseudoscalar higgs bosons while umssm only has one , because the would - be - goldstone boson becomes the longitudinal component of the @xmath21 boson .",
    "* nmssm has five neutralinos with the extra one coming from the singlino while umssm has six neutralinos with additional ones from the singlino and @xmath21-ino .",
    "* umssm also has a @xmath21 boson at tev scale .",
    "due to the first difference the sm - like higgs boson in nmssm often decays into two light pseudoscalar higgs boson @xcite . if so the production rates into @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath1 would be substantially smaller than the current data .",
    "however , some parameter - space points are uncovered recently such that the sm - like higgs boson can decay very similarly to the sm higgs boson @xcite .    to recap , the search for the final missing piece of the sm , the higgs boson , remains a tantalizing task for both experimentalists and theorists .",
    "we have demonstrated that in models beyond the sm like the umssm , we might be entertained by a sm - like higgs boson as a mimicker at the lhc .",
    "this sm - like higgs boson can be light in the mass range of 120  130 gev as indicated by the recent lhc data and behaves almost the same as the sm one or it can decay dominantly into invisible modes and therefore somewhat be hidden if it is heavier .",
    "more data are definitely needed at the lhc for detailed studies in order to differentiate among many variants of higgs bosons once we go beyond the sm .",

    "<S> motivated by the recent results in the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson search at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) we investigate the sm - like cp - even higgs boson of the @xmath0-extended minimal supersymmetric standard model ( umssm ) and its branching ratio into the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 modes . in the summer 2011 , a @xmath4 excess was reported in the channel @xmath5 around @xmath6 gev range . later on in december 2011 announcements were made that an excess was seen in the @xmath7 gev range , while the sm higgs boson above 131 gev up to about 600 gev is ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> we examine two scenarios of these mass ranges : ( i ) @xmath8 and show that the higgs boson can decay into invisible neutralinos to evade the sm bound ; and ( ii ) @xmath9 and show that the higgs boson can avoid decaying into neutralinos and thus gives enhanced rates into visible particles . </S>",
    "<S> we use the @xmath10 model of @xmath11 with tev scale supersymmetry to illustrate the idea by scanning the parameter space to realize these two different scenarios . </S>"
