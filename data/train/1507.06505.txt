    "@xcite recently showed that a transport current flowing along a quantum spin hall edge causes a precession of the magnetization of a magnetic island which locally gaps out the edge modes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a sketch of the device ) .",
    "the magnetization dynamics is driven by the spin transfer torque exerted on the magnetic island by electrons backscattering from the gapped region .",
    "indeed , the helical nature of the edge state implies that the backscattering electrons reverse their spin polarization , with the change in angular momentum transfered to the magnetic island .",
    "this effect is not only interesting in its own right , but may also have applications in spintronics .",
    "current - driven directed motion at the nanoscale has also been studied for mechanical degrees of freedom , as motivated by progress on nanoelectromechanical systems .",
    "qi and zhang @xcite proposed that a conducting helical molecule placed in a homogeneous electrical field could be made to rotate around its axis by a transport current and pointed out the intimate relations with the concept of a thouless pump @xcite .",

    "the effective spin current produces a spin - transfer toque and the magnetic moment precesses .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]    it is the purpose of the present paper to emphasize that the current - driven magnetization dynamics is another  perhaps more experimentally feasible  variant of a thouless motor and that the theory previously developed for adiabatic quantum motors @xcite is readily extended to this device .",
    "this theory not only provides a microscopic derivation of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation for the current - driven magnetization dynamics , but also allows one to discuss the efficiency of the device and to make the relation with the magnetization - driven quantum pumping of charge more explicit .",
    "specifically , we will employ an extension of the landauer - bttiker theory of quantum transport which includes the forces exerted by the electrons on a slow classical degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "markus bttiker developed landauer s vision of quantum coherent transport as a scattering problem into a theoretical framework @xcite and applied this scattering theory of quantum transport to an impressive variety of phenomena .",
    "these applications include aharonov - bohm oscillations @xcite , shot noise and current correlations @xcite , as well as edge - state transport in the integer hall effect @xcite and topological insulators @xcite",
    ". frequently , bttiker s predictions based on scattering theory provided reference points with which other theories  such as the keldysh green - function formalism @xcite or master equations @xcite  sought to make contact .    in the present context ,",
    "it is essential that scattering theory also provides a natural framework to study quantum coherent transport in systems under time - dependent driving . for adiabatic",
    "driving , bttiker s work with thomas and prtre @xcite was instrumental in developing a description of adiabatic quantum pumping @xcite in terms of scattering theory @xcite which provided a useful backdrop for later experiments @xcite . beyond the adiabatic regime , moskalets and bttiker combined the scattering approach with floquet theory to account for periodic driving @xcite .",
    "these works describe adiabatic quantum transport as a limit of the more general problem of periodic driving and ultimately triggered numerous studies on single - particle emitters and quantum capacitors ( as reviewed by moskalets and haack in this volume @xcite ) .    the basic idea of the adiabatic quantum motor @xcite is easily introduced by analogy with the archimedes screw , a device consisting of a screw inside a pipe . by turning the screw , water can be pumped against gravity .",
    "this is a classical analog of a quantum pump in which electrons are pumped between reservoirs by applying periodic potentials to a central scattering region .",
    "just as the archimedes pump can pump water against gravity , charge can be quantum pumped against a voltage .",
    "in addition , the archimedes screw has an inverse mode of operation as a _ motor _ : water pushed through the device will cause the screw to rotate .",
    "the adiabatic quantum motor is a quantum analog of this mode of operation in which a transport current pushed through a quantum coherent conductor induces unidirectional motion of a classical degree of freedom such as the rotations of a helical molecule .    the theory of adiabatic quantum motors @xcite exploits the assumption that the motor degrees of freedom  be they mechanical or magnetic  are slow compared to the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "in this adiabatic regime , the typical time scale of the mechanical dynamics is large compared to the dwell time of the electrons in the interaction region between motor and electrical degrees of freedom . in this limit",
    ", the dynamics of the two degrees of freedom can be discussed in a mixed quantum - classical description .",
    "the motor dynamics is described in terms of a classical equation of motion , while a fully quantum - coherent description is required for the fast electronic degrees of freedom .    from the point of view of the electrons , the motor degrees of freedom act as _ ac _ potentials which pump charge through the conductor .",
    "conversely , the backaction of the electronic degrees of freedom enters through adiabatic reaction forces on the motor degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "when there is just a single ( cartesian ) classical degree of freedom , these reaction forces are necessarily conservative , akin to the born - oppenheimer force in molecular physics @xcite .",
    "motor action driven by transport currents can occur when there is more than one motor degree of freedom ( or a single angle degree of freedom ) . in this case , the adiabatic reaction force need no longer be conservative when the electronic conductor is subject to a bias voltage @xcite .    in next order in the adiabatic approximation",
    ", the electronic system also induces frictional and lorentz - like forces , both of which are linear in the slow velocity of the motor degree of freedom . including the fluctuating langevin force which accompanies friction yields a classical langevin equation for the motor degree of freedom .",
    "this equation can be derived systematically within the keldysh formalism @xcite and the adiabatic reaction forces expressed through the scattering matrix of the coherent conductor @xcite .",
    "while these developments focused on mechanical degrees of freedom , it was also pointed out that the scattering theory of adiabatic reaction forces extends to magnetic degrees of freedom @xcite . in this case",
    ", adiabaticity requires that the precessional time scale of the magnetic moment is larger than the electronic dwell time .",
    "the effective classical description for the magnetic moment takes the form of a landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation .",
    "similar to nanoelectromechanical systems , the llg equation can be derived systematically in the adiabatic limit for a given microscopic model and the coefficients entering the llg equation can be expressed alternatively in terms of electronic green functions or scattering matrices @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will apply this general theory to a magnetic island coupled to a kramers pair of helical edge states .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews the scattering - matrix expressions for the torques entering the llg equation .",
    "section 3 applies this theory to helical edge states coupled to a magnetic island and makes the relation to adiabatic quantum motors explicit .",
    "section 4 defines and discusses the efficiency of this device and derives a direct relation between charge pumping and spin transfer torque .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "consider a coherent ( landauer - bttiker ) conductor coupled to a magnetic moment .",
    "the latter is assumed to be sufficiently large to justify a classical description of its dynamics but sufficiently small so that we can treat it as a single macrospin .",
    "then , its dynamics is ruled by a landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation @xmath0.\\ ] ] note that we use units in which @xmath1 is an angular momentum and for simplicity of notation , @xmath2 as well as @xmath3 differ from a conventional magnetic field by a factor of @xmath4 , the gyromagnetic ratio of the macrospin .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side describes the dynamics of the macrospin in the absence of coupling to the electrons .",
    "it is derived from the quantum hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the uncoupled macrospin , @xmath7 the magnetic field , and @xmath8 the easy - plane anisotropy of the macrospin .",
    "the coupling to the electrons leads to the additional effective magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "this term can be derived microscopically from the heisenberg equation of motion of the macrospin by evaluating the commutator of @xmath9 with the interaction hamiltonian between macrospin and electrons in the adiabatic approximation ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    ", we can write @xmath11 here , the first contribution @xmath12 can be viewed as the spin - transfer torque .",
    "the second term is a contribution to gilbert damping arising from the coupling between macrospin and electrons . in general , @xmath13 so derived is a tensor with symmetric and antisymmetric components . however",
    ", it can be seen that only the symmetric part plays a relevant role @xcite . finally , by fluctuation - dissipation arguments , the gilbert damping term is accompanied by a langevin torque @xmath3 with correlator @xmath14 its correlations are local in time as a consequence of the assumption of adiabaticity . as a result , we find the llg equation @xmath15,\\ ] ] for the macrospin @xmath1 .",
    "the spin - transfer torque , the gilbert damping , and the correlator @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of the scattering matrix of the coherent conductor , both in and out of equilibrium @xcite . before presenting the s - matrix expressions ,",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "first , the expression for the gilbert damping only contains the intrinsic damping originating from the coupling to the electronic degrees of freedom . coupling to other degrees of freedom might give further contributions to gilbert damping which could be included phenomenologically .",
    "second , in the study of the nanomagnet coupled to the helical modes we will consider the expressions to lowest order in the adiabatic approximation presented in sec .  [ lowest ] .",
    "the theory can actually be extended to include higher order corrections @xcite . in sec .",

    "[ lowest ]    this section summarizes the expressions for the coefficients of the llg equation that we will use to study the problem of the nanomagnet coupled to the helical edge states .",
    "these correspond to the lowest order in the adiabatic approximation , in which we retain only terms linear in @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    to this order",
    ", we can write the coefficients of the llg equation in terms of the electronic s - matrix for a static macrospin @xmath1 . the coupling between macrospin and electronic degrees of freedom enters through the dependence of the electronic s - matrix @xmath19 on the ( fixed ) macrospin . at this order ,",

    ", we must consider the electronic s - matrix in the presence of the _ time - dependent _ magnetization @xmath28 and expand it to linear order in the magnetization `` velocity '' @xmath29 .",
    "this can be done , e.g. , by starting from the full floquet scattering matrix @xmath30 for a periodic driving with period @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the indices @xmath26 and @xmath32 label the scattering channels of the coherent conductor and the arguments denote the energies @xmath33 of the incoming electron in channel @xmath26 and @xmath34 of the outgoing electron in channel @xmath32 . for small driving frequency @xmath31 , the floquet scattering matrix can be expanded in powers of @xmath35 , @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the fourier transform of the frozen scattering matrix @xmath38 introduced above , @xmath39 the matrix @xmath40 , first introduced by moskalets and bttiker , is the first adiabatic correction to the adiabatic s - matrix and can be transformed in a similar way to @xmath41 the matrix @xmath40 can be straightforwardly calculated from the retarded green function of the device ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we are now in a position to give expressions for the gilbert damping to next order in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "( the spin - transfer torque and the fluctuation correlator remain unchanged . ) to do so , we split the gilbert matrix @xmath13 into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts , @xmath42 strictly speaking , it is only the symmetric part which corresponds to gilbert damping .",

    "it can be seen , the second line is a pure nonequilibrium contribution ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "similarly , the antisymmetric part of the gilbert damping can be written as @xcite @xmath45_a,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is really a renormalization of the precession frequency as mentioned above .",
    "we now apply the above theory to a magnetic island coupled to a quantum spin hall edge as sketched in fig .",
    "the quantum spin hall edge supports a kramers doublet of edge states .",
    "the magnetization @xmath46 of the magnetic island induces a zeeman field @xmath47 acting on the electrons along the section of length @xmath48 of the edge state which is covered by the magnet .",
    "this zeeman field causes backscattering between the edge modes and induces a gap @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "linearizing the dispersion of the edge modes , the electronic hamiltonian takes the form @xcite @xmath50 here , the @xmath51 denote pauli matrices in spin space and @xmath52 is nonzero only over the region of length @xmath48 covered by the magnetic island .",
    "we have assumed for simplicity that the spin hall edge conserves @xmath53 .",
    "then , a static island magnetization induces a gap whenever it has a component perpendicular to the @xmath54-direction .",
    "indeed , @xmath55 is easily diagonalized for a spatially uniform coupling between edge modes and magnet , and the spectrum @xmath56 has a gap @xmath57 .    in the following , we assume that the easy - plane anisotropy @xmath8 is sufficiently large so that the magnetization entering the electronic hamiltonian can be taken in the @xmath58-plane , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "( however , we will have to keep @xmath60 in the llg equation when it is multiplied by the large anisotropy @xmath61 . )    the electronic hamiltonian ( [ elh ] ) is equivalent to the electronic hamiltonian of the thouless motor considered in ref .",

    "we can now use this scattering matrix to evaluate the various coefficients in the llg equation , employing the expressions given in sec .",
    "assuming zero temperature , we find @xmath65 for the spin transfer torque at arbitrary chemical potential @xmath66 . here , we have defined the function @xmath67 with @xmath68 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "below , we will identify @xmath69 with the charge pumped between the reservoirs during one precessional period of the magnetization @xmath1 .",
    "the vector @xmath12 points in the azimuthal direction in the magnetization plane and indeed corresponds to a spin - transfer torque .",

    ", we can now write the llg equation for the nanomagnet coupled to the helical edge state , @xmath74 where @xmath75 , we have expressed @xmath76 , and assumed zero external magnetic field @xmath7 . this completes our scattering - theory derivation of the llg equation and generalizes the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite on phenomenological grounds in several respects .",
    "equation ( [ llgnan ] ) applies also for finite - length magnets and chemical potentials both inside and outside the magnetization - induced gap of the edge - state spectrum .",
    "moreover , the identification of the @xmath77-term as a damping term necessitates the inclusion of the langevin torque @xmath3 . indeed ,",
    "@xcite refers to the entire term involving @xmath78 as the spin - transfer torque . in contrast",
    ", our derivation produces the term involving @xmath18 already in zeroth order in magnetization `` velocity '' @xmath10 , while the @xmath77 term appears only to linear order .",
    "thus , the latter term is really a conrtribution to damping and related to the energy dissipated in the electron system due to the time dependence of the magnetization .",
    "while the electronic hamiltonian for the edge modes is equivalent to that of the thouless motor discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the llg equation for the macrospin differ from the equation of motion of the mechanical degrees of freedom discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the energetics and the efficiency of the magnetic thouless motor against the backdrop of its mechanical cousin .",

    "it is interesting to note that the angular frequency @xmath77 of the precession is just given by the applied bias voltage , independent of the damping strength .",
    "this should be contrasted with the mechanical thouless motor . here",
    ", the motor degree of freedom satisfies a newton equation of motion which is second order in time .",
    "thus , the frequency of revolution is inversely proportional to the damping coefficient .    in steady state ,",
    "the magnetic thouless motor balances the energy provided by the voltage source through the spin - transfer torque @xmath12 against the dissipation through gilbert damping due to the intrinsic coupling between magnetic moment and electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "it is instructive to look at these contributions independently .",
    "the work performed by the spin - transfer torque per precessional period is given by @xmath83 writing this as an integral over a closed loop of the magnetization @xmath1 and inserting the s - matrix expression ( [ stts ] ) , we find @xmath84 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] without applied bias , the integrand is just the gradient of a scalar function and the integral vanishes .",

    "the corresponding gain @xmath88 in electrical energy is driving the magnetic thouless motor .",
    "this result can also be written as @xmath89 for the power provided per unit time by the voltage source .",
    "the relation between spin - transfer torque and pumped charge also allows us to identify the function @xmath90 appearing in the llg equation as the charge in units of @xmath91 pumped between the reservoirs during one precessional period of the macrospin , @xmath92 this can be obtained either by deriving the pumped charge explicitly from the s - matrix expression or by evaluating eq .",

    "imagine the same setup as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but with an additional load coupled to the magnetization .",
    "we can now define the efficiency of the magnetic thouless motor as the ratio of the power delivered to the load and the electrical power @xmath101 provided by the voltage source . in steady state ,",
    "the power delivered to the load has to balance against the power provided by the electrons , i.e. , @xmath102 .",

    "this problem is analogous to the problem of the optimal efficiency of a thermoelectric device which leads to the definition of the important zt value .",

    "the maximum efficiency is realized for @xmath113 which requires a finite pumped charge at zero conductance . unlike thermoelectrics , the motor efficiency is bounded by @xmath114 instead of the carnot efficiency .",
    "this reflects the fact that electrical energy can be fully converted into magnetic energy .",
    "specifically , unit efficiency is reached in the limit of a true thouless motor with zero transmission when the fermi energy falls into the gap and nonzero and quantized pumped charge per period .",
