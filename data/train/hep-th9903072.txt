    "in recent years , remarkable progress has been witnessed in the study of the scaling region nearby the fixed points of the renormalization group ( rg ) of 2-d statistical models .",
    "such progress has been possible thanks to new ideas related to the @xmath0matrix theory @xcite and there is now a well  defined program to analyse off  critical statistical models . in short ,",
    "this usually consists in implementing the following steps : ( a ) a deformation of a conformal field theory ( cft ) describing the critical point by means of a _ relevant _ integrable operator which drives the model away from criticality ; ( b ) a consequent determination of the exact spectrum of the massive or massless excitations and the elastic @xmath0matrix scattering amplitudes thereof ; ( c ) and finally , a reconstruction of the off  critical correlators by means of the form factor approach also accompanied by an analysis of the finite size behaviour of the theory by means of the thermodynamics bethe ansatz ( tba ) .",
    "the scattering theory of the ising model in a magnetic field @xcite together with the calculation of its correlators @xcite provide an explicit example of a statistical model solved away from criticality along the line of the above program .",
    "solutions for many other off  critical models have also been found ( see for instance [ 3 - 19 ] ) .",
    "hereinafter the statistical models solved according to an @xmath0matrix program will be simply referred as _ bootstrap models_.    all known boostrap models greatly differ from each other by the nature of their spectrum , for the total number of particles and for the detailed structure of their scattering amplitudes . however , looking at them as a whole , they share an important feature , which consists in the fermionic nature of their scattering amplitudes .",
    "namely , the @xmath0-matrix involving two identical particles takes the value @xmath4 at the threshold of their @xmath5-channel , i.e. @xmath6 ( for the notation see below ) .",
    "this condition was proved to be quite important in the further study of their off  shell behaviour .",
    "in the thermodynamics bethe ansatz calculations , for instance , fermionic ",
    "type @xmath0-matrices lead to well  defined integral equations which  in all known models  provide real solutions for the ground state energy , in perfect agreement with the cft prediction @xcite . on the other hand , in the form factor approach , fermionic @xmath0matrices give rise to spectral series of the correlation functions with fast convergent properties ( see for instance , @xcite ) .    among the set of",
    "known solved models the peculiar absence of examples relative to an @xmath0matrix of bosonic  type , i.e. an @xmath0-matrix which satisfies the condition @xmath7 , is indeed intriguing .",
    "what is the reason ? while a widespread suspicion is that such @xmath0-matrices are unphysical , a full understanding of their features and also of their interpretation are still missing .",
    "deeply related to the absence of models with a bosonic ",
    "type @xmath0matrix , there is also the question about the role played in the scattering theory by the so  called cdd factors .",
    "it is well known that they give rise to ambiguity in the @xmath0matrix of a bootstrap system and it seems therefore quite striking that all consistent boostrap models have managed to successfully resolve this ambiguity .",
    "the aim of this paper is to address some of the above questions .",
    "in particular , we will draw some conclusions about the interpretation of the physical aspects which occur in an integrable theory based on a bosonic  type @xmath0-matrix .",
    "we will consider the simplest non  trivial scattering theory of this kind , consisting of one self ",

    "notice that the asymptotical behaviour of this @xmath0matrix is given by @xmath20 .",
    "as it will become clear in the next section , the @xmath0matrix ( [ msh ] ) can also be equivalently regarded as a pure cdd factor added to an initial fermionic  type @xmath0matrix .    a word of caution .",
    "in the following we will often use the terminology `` qft '' to denote briefly and concisely a hypotetical theory underlying the scattering processes .",
    "the terminology does not automatically mean that this underlying theory is a _ consistent _ quantum field theory , the peculiar features of which are precisely the object of analysis .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly discuss the cdd factors and their relation with a perturbed cft . in section 3",
    "we discuss the difficulties which the bosonic  type @xmath0matrix ( [ msh ] ) pose both in the tba analysis and in the form factor approach  difficulties which prevents its interpretation in terms of a standard quantum field theory . section 4 is devoted to an interpretation of the bosonic ",
    "type @xmath0matrix ( [ msh ] ) as the one coming from the critical ising model perturbed by a combination of relevant and irrelevant operators .",
    "we will argue that this combination induces an instability in the ground state of the theory , in agreement with the results of the tba analysis for the bosonic ",
    "type @xmath0matrix ( [ msh ] ) .",
    "finally our conclusions are summarised in section 5 .",
    "to analyse the scaling region around a critical point described by a cft , one usually considers the deformation of the conformal action @xmath21 by means of one of its _ relevant _ operators @xmath22 = a_cft + ( x ) d^2x .",
    "[ action ] the resulting action  which describes a rg flow from the original cft to another fixed point  gives rise in the minkowski space to the scattering processes among the massless or massive excitations present away from the critical point @xcite .",
    "important simplifications occur when the action ( [ action ] ) defines an integrable quantum field theory : in this case , in fact , all the scattering processes are purely elastic and can be expressed in terms of the two - particle scattering amplitudes @xmath23 . on a general basis ,",
    "these amplitudes satisfy the unitarity and crossing symmetry conditions    l s_ab ( ) s_ab(- ) = 1 ; + s_ab ( ) = s_ab(i - ) .",
    "[ unitcros ] possible bound states which occur in the scattering processes are promoted to asymptotic states so that the amplitudes satisfy the additional bootstrap equations s_cd ( ) = s_bd(-i |u_bc^a ) s_ad(+ i    @xmath24 is the location of the simple pole in @xmath23 which identifies the bound state @xmath25 in the scattering channel @xmath26 .",
    "the solution of the above equations presents the well  known ambiguity relative to the cdd factors .",
    "let @xmath27 be a set of functions with a minimum number of poles which solve both eqs.([unitcros ] ) and ( [ bootstrap ] ) .",
    "another solution of the first equations ( [ unitcros ] ) can easily be obtained by multiplying each amplitude @xmath27 by the so  called cdd factors , i.e. an arbitrary product of functions @xmath28 defined in eq.([msh ] ) , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , each @xmath28 automatically satisfies eqs.([unitcros ] ) and hence their product .",
    "additional constraints on such cdd factors may come from the bootstrap equations ( [ bootstrap ] ) , which they also have to satisfy . since the cdd factors do not introduce extra poles in the physical sheet @xmath31",
    ", the conclusion is that the knowledge of the structure of the bound states alone can not uniquely fix the scattering theory .",
    "this ambiguity is however not harmless since scattering theories which differ by cdd factors have a distinct physical content , in particular a different ultraviolet behaviour .",
    "how can we interpret @xmath0matrices which differ by cdd factors in terms of an underlying action ?",
    "first of all , the cdd factors do not spoil  by construction ",
    "the integrable nature of the original @xmath0matrix , simply because they only add extra phase  shifts to the original elastic scattering amplitudes .",
    "moreover , they also do not alter the structure of the bound states ",
    "an infrared property of theory  , because they do not introduce extra poles in the @xmath0matrix .",
    "since they mainly influence the ultraviolet behaviour , it seems natural to assume that @xmath0matrices related to one another by cdd factors are associated to integrable actions which , in the vicinity of a fixed point , may differ for insertion of irrelevant scalar operators @xmath32 = a_cft + ( x ) d^2x + _ i _",
    "i(x ) d^2x .",
    "[ actionirr ] these irrelevant operators should preserve the set of conserved currents ( or part of it ) of the original action ( [ action ] ) and they should also share the same symmetry properties of the relevant operator @xmath22 .",
    "their presence has however several consequences .",
    "in fact , from a rg geometric point of view the irrelevant operators @xmath32 are associated to rg trajectories which flow into the fixed point , whereas the relevant operators are associated to those rg trajectories which depart from it .",
    "hence , the simultaneous presence of relevant and irrelevant operators gives rise to a rg trajectory which will pass very closely to the fixed point in question but without stopping at it ( figure 1 ) . in its vicinity",
    ", its action can be parameterised as in ( [ actionirr ] ) .",
    "however , in contrast with the qft defined by the action ( [ action ] ) , the action given by eq.([actionirr ] ) does not automatically ensure the consistency of the relative quantum field theory in the entire rg space of the couplings , i.e. on all possible distance scales .",
    "obviously , there are some preliminary steps in order to give a meaning to the expression ( [ actionirr ] ) .    first of all",
    ", the irrelevant operators initially present in ( [ actionirr ] ) will be accompanied by an infinite number of counterterms , so that the final form of the action of the theory will be actually given by the one of ( [ actionirr ] ) together with this infinite tower of higher irrelevant operators .",
    "this status of art however is not catastrophic as it may appear since the theory can still remain predictive in view of the fact that all counterterms can be constrained by the request of integrability @xcite .",
    "a real source of problem is another one .",
    "in fact , in contrast to those theories which are obtained by perturbing a cft by means of relevant operators , where their ultraviolet behaviour is completly under control and ruled in fact by the initially cft , the ultraviolet behaviour of those quantum field theories defined as in ( [ actionirr ] ) will be , instead , a  priori unknown .",
    "since at the short distances the effective coupling constants of the irrelevant operators become extremely large , it should not be a surprise to find out that one may define a consistent quantum field theory in this regime only for special sign of the leading irrelevant coupling to which we add the interaction @xmath33 .",
    "assume that the solution of the theory at @xmath34 is exactly known .",
    "although a perturbation theory can be formally applied for any sign of the new coupling @xmath35 , it is obvious that the new hamiltonian will define a consistent theory only for positive values of this coupling since for @xmath35 negative , no matter how small it may be , there is no longer a stable vacuum . ] .",
    "this condition is realised , for instance , for the roaming trajectory of the toda field theories @xcite which in each neighborhood of the fixed points it passes , may be regarded as a rg flow induced by a combination of the relevant operator @xmath36 and the irrelevant operator @xmath37 , for an appropriate set of the couplings @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "another choice of the sign of the couplings nearby the critical points may induce an ultraviolet instability of the ground state of the theory at certain scale @xmath38 which will spoil a quantum field theory interpretation for distance scales @xmath39 . as we will see , this seems to be the scenario associated to the @xmath0matrix ( [ msh ] ) .",
    "a deceptively simple @xmath0matrix affected by a cdd ambiguity is obtained by multiplying a scattering amplitude @xmath40 by @xmath4 ( which may be considered as a particular @xmath41 term , i.e. @xmath42 ) .",
    "if the original scattering theory does not have any bound states , i.e. if there are no constraints coming from the non  linear bootstrap equations ( [ bootstrap ] ) , there is evidently no obstacle to this multiplication .",
    "consequently , by means of this cdd factor we can swap from a fermionic ",
    "type @xmath0matrix to a bosonic one and viceversa .",
    "this is the case , for instance of the @xmath0matrix of the sinh - gordon model , which is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a function of the coupling constant of the model @xcite .",
    "the result of this multiplication is in fact the bosonic ",
    "type @xmath0matrix ( [ msh ] ) . for this reason , the model associated to the @xmath0matrix ( [ msh ] )",
    "may be referred to as `` minus sinh - gordon model '' ( mshg )",
    ".    there is , however , another way of looking at the @xmath0matrix ( [ msh ] ) .",
    "it may be seen , in fact , as the one obtained by multiplying @xmath45 by a cdd factor @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath45 is the @xmath0matrix of the thermal ising model @xcite and therefore the analysis of this bosonic ",

    "there is a simple way to see that the theory defined by the @xmath0-matrix ( [ bosonic ] ) presents some problematic aspects from the point of view of a quantum field theory .",
    "let us compute in fact the free energy @xmath46 of such a theory on a cylinder of length @xmath47 and radius @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 ) by means of the tba approach @xcite . as usual ,",
    "@xmath50 can be interpreted as the temperature of the one  dimensional system living on an infinite line , @xmath51 .",

    "[ number ] in the above formulas , @xmath55 is the density of occupied states ( roots ) of rapidity @xmath56 whereas @xmath57 is the total density of states ( roots and holes ) , @xmath58 .",

    "[ equilibrium ]    the above discussion briefly summarises the basic ideas of the thermodynamical bethe ansatz approach .",

    "( [ freeenergy ] ) and ( [ pseudoenergy ] ) . at zero chemical potential @xmath67 ,",
    "no matter how small @xmath10 may be ( but never zero ) , the numerical solution of the above equations shows the existence of a critical value of the variable @xmath48 , such that for @xmath68 , the free energy assumes complex values ( figure 2 ) .",
    "it is worth noting the novelty of this situation , which in fact does not occur in all other known ( fermionic ) models , analysed in the past in terms of the tba equations ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "how can we interpret the occurrence of this critical point in @xmath48 and the complex values assumed by the free energy for @xmath69 ?",
    "what are the consequences of this result ?",
    "the answer to these questions may be expressed both in physical or in purely mathematical terms .",
    "the simplest physical answer is the following .",
    "since the tba equations provides the full resummation of the virial expansion of @xmath61 , @xmath70 is then identified with the radius of convergence of the corresponding series .",
    "the existence of this singularity indicates a non - trivial ultraviolet behaviour of the theory , in particular , it definetly precludes its standard interpretation in terms of a conformal field theory deformed by a relevant operator ) and the corresponding dilogarithmic functions . in our case",
    "the plateau of the kink configuration , solution of algebraic equation @xmath71 is in fact complex , @xmath72 . ] .",
    "the singularity at @xmath73 may be effectively regarded as a sort of bose  einstein condensation phenomenon . to show this , firstly notice that the partition function ( [ freeenergy ] ) admits an interpretation as that of a _",
    "free _ bosonic gas of exitations @xmath74 but with dispersion relations which depend on the temperature @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the energy @xmath75 of one of these excitations @xmath74 we have @xmath76 , where @xmath66 is solution of the integral equation ( [ pseudoenergy ] ) .",
    "hence , in a way completely similar to the fermionic case analysed in @xcite , one can establish the equivalence between the partition function obtained in eq.([freeenergy ] ) and the one computed in terms of the following series z(l , r ) = _",
    "n=0^ z^n ( _ n )  ( _ 1 ) | ( _ 1 )  ( _ n ) e^-((_1 ) + + ( _ n ) ) , [ bosonicsum ] where the scalar product of the states is computed according to the commutation rules of _ free bosonic particles _ , with a regularization given by ^2 ( ) ( -  ) .",
    "in fact , for the partition function in ( [ freeenergy ] ) we have the following expansion in powers of @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 admits the representation @xmath80 with @xmath81 on the other hand , computing the partition function by using the expression ( [ bosonicsum ] ) , @xmath82 for the first term we have @xmath83 and similarly @xmath84 + \\frac{(m l)}{4 } i_4 \\,\\,\\ , , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] etc .",
    "hence , it is easy to see that the series ( [ series1 ] ) precisely coincides with that of eq.([series22 ] ) , the only difference being in the arrangement of the single terms : the terms proportional to @xmath77 in all @xmath85 gives @xmath79 as their sum , whereas the sum of the terms proportional to @xmath86 appearing in all @xmath85 gives rise to the higher power @xmath87 .    in the light of these considerations , it is then natural to expect that the partition function ( [ freeenergy ] ) will have a singularity at that value of the temperature @xmath70 where the energy of the excitation ( at zero rapidity ) vanishes ( figure 3 ) .",
    "when this happens , the contribution coming from the average occupation number with @xmath88 becomes as important as the entire series , producing a singularity in the free energy which resembles that of the usual bose ",
    "einstein condensation .",
    "one should not be surprised that such effect occurs in this low dimensional system due to the entanglement of the energy @xmath75 of its excitation with the temperature itself of the system . in conclusion , from the tba analysis one infers that in our bosonic ",
    "type model there is a scale of distance @xmath89 below which there is a change in the ground state of the theory .",
    "obviously it is not surprising to find out that the evaluation of the series beyond its radius of convergence provides complex values , although no direct physical meaning can be assigned to them .    from a purely mathematical point of view",
    ", the occurrence of complex values in @xmath64 simply indicates the _ failure _ of the minimization procedure applied to evaluate the free  energy ( [ functional ] ) .",
    "namely , in our case , it is no longer true that the functional ( [ functional ] ) admits a minimum with respect to the ( positive ) real distributions @xmath57 and @xmath55 for _ any _ value of @xmath48 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the real minima of the functional ( [ functional ] ) disappear for @xmath90 , becoming complex .",
    "hence the value of the functional ( [ functional ] ) _ computed at its minima _ , i.e. @xmath91 , takes for @xmath69 complex values whereas the functional @xmath92 itself becomes instead unbounded from below for this range of @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that the saddle point procedure employed by the tba is no longer justified  matrix . ]",
    ". however , if we still insist on enforcing the validity of the relationship ( [ association ] ) between the free  energy and the casimir energy of the theory , we should conclude that the divergence of the free ",
    "energy for @xmath90 implies the corresponding divergence of the central charge of the theory .",
    "as we will show in the next section , the same conclusion is also reached by using the form factor approach .",

    ". they can not be either descendent fields of the energy field , since they are all quadratic in the fermionic field : their insertion in the action ( [ majorana ] ) will not induce scattering processes among the fermion particles but will only change their dispersion relations .",
    "hence , the first irrelevant field which can be introduced in ( [ action1 ] ) in order to have extra scattering processes is @xmath180 .",

    "the theory is still integrable at the lowest order @xcite although @xmath182 in ( [ majoranatt ] ) should be considered at this stage as an effective action .",

    "since the operator @xmath183 is expected to be effective at very high  energy scales , this suggests matching the lowest order coming from the perturbation theory of ( [ majoranatt ] ) with the @xmath0matrix ( [ msh ] ) , both computed in their high  energy limit . in this kinematical regime the two particles involved in the scattering can be effectively seen as left and right movers .",

    "it is important to note that the sign of the above coupling constant is _ opposite _ of the one relative to the roaming model nearby the ising fixed point @xcite .",
    "this difference in the sign of the coupling relative to the first irrelevant operator seems therefore responsible for the quite distinct ultraviolet behaviour of the two theories : the roaming model has in fact a smooth ultraviolet behaviour controlled by the nearest tricritical ising point ( with central charge @xmath192 ) whereas the qft associated to our bosonic @xmath0matrix develops instead an ultraviolet instability .",
    "this situation evidently resembles the two different behaviours which originate from the change of sign in the example of footnote 5 .",
    "let us finally add a few comments on the full hamiltonian of the theory . as discussed in section 2 , the action ( [ majoranatt ] ) will also contain higher derivative terms @xmath193 , so that in general we can write @xmath194 the a  dimensional constants @xmath195 can be in principle determined by the integrability condition of the theory , i.e. by matching the expansion of the @xmath0matrix in power of @xmath196 with the feynman graphs which originate from ( [ majoranatotal ] ) . for",

    "denoted as before by @xmath198 , it is convenient to write the hamiltonian in terms of a dimensionless kernel @xmath199 , ( @xmath200 ) , as h = : : dx + g m^2 : |:(x ) v(x -y ) : |:(y ) dx dy [ nonlocal ] in such way that the coupling constants of the higher derivative terms are nothing but the higher moments of @xmath199 . therefore ,",
    "once the coefficients @xmath195 were known , the kernel @xmath199 can be recovered in terms of an inverse mellin transformation .",
    "the advantage of expressing the hamiltonian in this way is twofold .",
    "first of all , it shows that the hamiltonian is actually renormalisable albeit obviously non  local .",
    "secondly , it provides an easy argument to show that the non  local term is the one responsable for the instability of the theory .",
    "this argument is based on the simple hypothesis that @xmath201 .",
    "let us consider in fact the hamiltonian ( [ nonlocal ] ) in the hartree ",
    "fock approximation and let us define an order parameter @xmath202 . for field configurations which do not vary on @xmath203 ,",
    "the value of the hamiltonian ( [ nonlocal ] ) for unit volume is given by = m - g v ^2 , [ hartreefock ] where @xmath204 .",
    "when @xmath205 , we can always subtract from @xmath206 an infinite constant ( due to the dirac sea of the fermion ) such that we can restrict to the positive values of @xmath207 and the minimum of @xmath206 is therefore obtained for @xmath208 .",
    "this subtraction is equivalent to a selection of the vacuum state for the free theory .",
    "however , when we switch on a positive value of @xmath181 , the quantity @xmath206 becomes once again unbounded from below , so that there would be an instability of the vacuum originally selected by the free theory .",
    "hence the above hypothesis permits to understand in an easy way the nature of the problem posed by our bosonic @xmath0matrix , i.e. the instability of the vacuum state of the underlying microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the physical properties of the simplest bosonic ",
    "type @xmath0matrix with the aim to clarify the nature of its pathological behaviour , in particular at its short  distance scales .",
    "the tba approach has shown that the difficulties consist in an instability of the vacuum state of the theory which occurs at a certain distance or energy scale , i.e. in the failure of the usual saddle point approach to minimise the free  energy .",
    "this quantity in fact for @xmath69 becomes in our case unbounded from below . even in the absence of the above method",
    ", the peculiar physical behaviour of the qft associated to a bosonic @xmath0matrix may be inferred by the computation of its form factors .",
    "we have seen in fact that even with some stringent constraints imposed on the matrix elements they are intrinsically largely undetermined . moreover , the spectral series which originate from them are generically divergent .    even after the thorough analysis of this paper",
    ", one could be still surprised that an innocent @xmath4 in front of an @xmath0matrix is the source of all the pathological features of the qft associated to such an @xmath0matrix .",
    "the fact is that the @xmath0matrix , even for the integrable models where it takes a particularly simple form , is still the final result of an infinite resummation of all microscopic processes dictated by an hamiltonian .",
    "therefore while it is in general relatively simple to decide whether or not an hamiltonian may give rise to a consistent quantum theory  in terms of stability of the vacuum and the relative excitations thereof ",
    "( once again , the simple example of footnote 5 is particularly instructive ) , the model analysed in this paper shows on the contrary that it may be in general `` algorithmically '' difficult to trace all this information back and to infer the consistency of a theory starting from the end , i.e. from the knowledge alone of the @xmath0matrix .",
    "several questions arise in relation to the observations of the previous sections .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting to analyse the qft associated to more general cdd factors and characterise those which have a smooth interpolation from the short to the large distance scales , i.e. those ones which identify consistent qft .",
    "moreover , actions which are initially obtained by a perturbation of irrelevant fields contain an infinite series of corrections due to the higher dimension operators and hence they are generally non  local . in this respect , it would be useful to develop a powerful method for determining in an efficient way all the coupling constants of these operators and to have a criterion to identify those non ",
