    "let @xmath1 be a closed simply connected symplectic @xmath0-manifold and let @xmath2 be a symplectic form on @xmath1 , i.e. a closed , nondegenerate @xmath3-form .",
    "a closed ( oriented ) embedded surface @xmath4 is called + - _ symplectic _ if @xmath5 restricts to a symplectic form on @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 ; + - _ lagrangian _ if @xmath5 restricts to the trivial form on @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath8 .    given two submanifolds representing the same homology class , we say that they are isotopic if they can be joined by a family of embedded submanifolds . by the isotopy extension theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) , this is equivalent to the existence of an ambient isotopy of @xmath1 connecting them .",
    "isotopic submanifolds are essentially the same , from the point of view of the smooth topology of @xmath1 , so in order to study the topological aspects of symplectic and lagrangian submanifolds of @xmath1 we need to take into account the equivalence relation above .",
    "this leads to the following + * problem * ( p ) : fix a homology class @xmath9 ; classify all the symplectic ( lagrangian ) representatives of @xmath10 up to the equivalence relation above . +",
    "this problem was first posed , in the study of lagrangian @xmath11 s linear outside a ball in @xmath12 ( where the homology condition becomes irrelevant ) by arnold in @xcite , and further generalized , also in the lagrangian case , by eliashberg and polterovich ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the interest in the symplectic version of this problem was triggered more recently by siebert and tian ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are several ways in which we can interpret ( p ) .",
    "the first starts from the observation that two submanifolds of a simply connected @xmath0-manifold are homologous if and only if they are images of homotopic embeddings ( this follows from a quite straightforward exercise in algebraic topology ) .",
    "therefore the study of the representatives of a given homology class , up to isotopy , is a suitable generalization of classical knot theory .",
    "problem ( p ) amounts therefore to symplectic ( lagrangian ) _ surface - knot theory _ for @xmath13 .",
    "the second interpretation stems from the classical observation that if we consider the case when @xmath1 is a khler surface , and we look at complex representatives of the same homology class , these are always isotopic ( even in a stronger sense , i.e. through complex representatives ) .",
    "problem ( p ) can be interpreted therefore as the investigation of the natural counterpart of that property in the symplectic setup , with the added condition that , in a symplectic manifold , we have two kinds of natural submanifolds .",
    "( observe that , while symplectic submanifolds generalize the notion of complex submanifolds , they are defined with an open condition , while lagrangian submanifolds are defined , like the complex ones , with a closed one ; in this sense , both kinds of submanifolds share some of the properties of complex ones . ) with this interpretation , problem ( p ) enters in the larger question of understanding whether the class of symplectic manifolds , that lies somewhere between the class of khler surfaces and general @xmath0-manifolds , exhibits features typical of the former or of the latter . to clarify this comment , we want to point out that for a smooth @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 there is a rather general construction ( see @xcite ) of infinitely many nonisotopic representatives of a homology class @xmath10 , so that the smooth counterpart of problem ( p ) ( i.e. surface - knot theory for @xmath13 ) can be extremely rich , as opposed to  complex \" knot theory for khler manifolds which is , as noted , trivial .    problem ( p ) , in the way it is stated ,",
    "is clearly very ambitious , and what we can realistically hope at the moment is to prove that for a pair @xmath13 there is a unique symplectic ( lagrangian ) representative , or else build infinitely many nonisotopic representatives .    the first results around ( p )",
    "have all been in the direction of uniqueness .",
    "just to mention few , eliashberg and polterovich proved in @xcite uniqueness of lagrangian representatives for @xmath11 in @xmath12 , answering arnold s question ; also , they proved in @xcite an analogous result for the class of the section in @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the symplectic case , siebert and tian proved in @xcite that a symplectic surface in @xmath16 homologous to an algebraic curve of degree @xmath17 is in fact isotopic to it ( at least for @xmath18 ) .    such results , and the nature of their proofs ,",
    "might have suggested the possibility of obtaining a uniqueness result holding for all pairs @xmath13 , as in the khler case .",
    "instead , fintushel and stern have shown in @xcite that this is not the case , exhibiting the first example of homologous , nonisotopic symplectic tori , in a large class of symplectic manifolds ( including , for example , elliptic surfaces ) .",
    "the first examples of nonuniqueness for the lagrangian case have appeared in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present and discuss several examples where we can partially answer ( p ) showing nonuniqueness of symplectic or lagrangian representatives for some pair @xmath13 .",
    "all these constructions , in a more or less direct way , start from the ideas contained in @xcite , and we will try to point out the several common aspects . in section [ const ] we are going to discuss the actual construction of infinite families of symplectic ( lagrangian ) representatives for suitable pairs @xmath13 , while in section [ noniso ] we will discuss how ( and to which level ) we can distinguish the elements of these families .",
    "in these two sections we will restrict the discussion to genus one surfaces . in section",
    "[ last ] , instead , we are going to show a more recent construction of examples for genus greater than one .",
    "the results presented below , when not explicitly attributed , can be considered to be a sort of  common folklore \" , or can be easily obtained by looking at related papers ( of the author or others ) , quoted in the references .",
    "it should be clear , however , that much credit is due to the ideas contained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , for obvious reasons of brevity , this paper does not aspire to be a complete survey on the topic , and follows instead tastes and preferences of the author , even at the price of omitting significant results .",
    "it is quite clear that describing the symplectic ( lagrangian ) submanifolds of a symplectic @xmath0-manifold starting from the definition is a rather difficult task , as the definition itself does not shed too much light on global properties of such submanifolds .",
    "the basic idea underlying this section will be to use a class of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds where we are allowed to reduce the problem , at least in part , to a @xmath19-dimensional problem , and we can translate the property of being symplectic or lagrangian into a quite simpler problem of curves in a fibered @xmath19-manifold .    the class of @xmath0-manifolds that we are going to consider , and that has saved the day in many problems of symplectic topology , is the class of link surgery manifolds .",
    "precisely , we are going to exploit the following dictionary ( inspired from @xcite ) :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to explain the dictionary , we start with the definition of link surgery manifolds ( see @xcite ) for a fibered link @xmath20 .",
    "consider an @xmath21-component oriented link @xmath22 whose exterior fibers over @xmath23 with fiber @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath24 note that we do not require @xmath6 to span the link @xmath20 , namely the ( poincar dual of the ) class of @xmath6 in @xmath25 may be different from @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , we will consider the case where @xmath6 spans one link component , e.g. @xmath27 = ( 1,0, ... ,0)$ ] . if @xmath27 = ( m_{1}, ... ,m_{n})$ ] , the fiber @xmath6 intersects the @xmath28-th boundary component @xmath29 , up to isotopy , in the curve @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a simple closed curve and @xmath32 is some integer coefficient determined by the equation above ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "complete @xmath31 to a basis @xmath33 for @xmath29 .",
    "for example , if @xmath34 , @xmath35 and we can choose @xmath36 .",
    "next , choose a family @xmath37 of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds , each containing a framed , symplectic , self - intersection @xmath38 torus @xmath39 .",
    "we can now define the @xmath0-manifold @xmath40 the gluing map on the boundary @xmath19-tori is defined in such a way to identify @xmath39 with @xmath41 and , reversing the orientation , the meridian to the torus @xmath39 with @xmath31 .",
    "the manifold above depends on various choices , besides the link @xmath20 and the pairs @xmath42 , but we are going to omit such dependence from the notation as this will not affect our discussion . the homotopy type of @xmath43 can be easily determined from the @xmath37 s and the gluing data . in particular , in the cases we will consider @xmath43 will be simply connected",
    ". an important feature of this manifold is that we can explicitly compute the seiberg - witten polynomial of @xmath43 ( and , more generally , of any link surgery manifold ) in terms of the relative seiberg - witten invariants of @xmath42 and the symmetrized multivariable alexander polynomial of the link @xmath20 .",
    "the work of @xcite and @xcite shows that , for @xmath44 ( the case we will be interested in ) , @xmath45 in this equation @xmath46 represents the ( poincar dual to the ) homology class of @xmath47 , and we are identifying in the product the homology classes according to the gluing of ( [ glue ] ) .",
    "remember that the relative seiberg - witten polynomial of @xmath42 is defined as the seiberg - witten polynomial of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the simply connected elliptic surface without singular fibers of euler characteristic @xmath50 ( in particular @xmath51 , and we will be mainly interested in this case ) .    to show that @xmath43 admits a symplectic structure ,",
    "we need a second presentation of it as symplectic fiber sum of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds . in order to do so ,",
    "perform dehn surgery on @xmath52 along @xmath20 , using as slopes on each boundary component the curves @xmath31 described in ( [ slope ] ) : this gives a closed three manifold @xmath53 . by extending the fibration of @xmath54 with the fibration of @xmath55 of degree @xmath56 on each dehn filling , @xmath53 fibers over @xmath23 with fiber @xmath57 , the closed surface obtained by capping off each boundary component of @xmath6 with a disk ( contained in the suitable dehn filling ) .",
    "the cores @xmath58 of the dehn fillings ( i.e. the so called dual link ) are transverse , up to isotopy , to @xmath59 .",
    "( note that , unless all divisibilities @xmath56 are equal to one , these are not sections of the fibration . )",
    "now we can associate to a fibration of @xmath53 a closed nondegenerate @xmath60-form @xmath61 , defined up to isotopy .",
    "if we denote by @xmath62 a closed two - form on @xmath53 that restricts to a volume form on the fiber @xmath59 , the @xmath0-manifold @xmath63 admits a symplectic @xmath3-form @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a sufficiently small constant .",
    "consider the cores @xmath58 ; because of the transversality condition we have @xmath66 , which implies that @xmath67 i.e. the tori @xmath68 are symplectic .",
    "moreover , they are naturally endowed with a framing inherited from the framing of the @xmath58 s , that we can assume to be the one identified by @xmath69 . by suitably scaling the symplectic form on the @xmath37 s",
    ", we can arrange that the symplectic volume on @xmath68 coincides with the one of @xmath70 .",
    "we can then write @xmath43 as symplectic fiber sum : @xmath71",
    "gompf s theory of symplectic fiber sums ( @xcite ) guarantees then that @xmath43 admits a symplectic form which restricts , outside the gluing locus , to the ones of the factors .",
    "there is a second result ( see @xcite ) that allows us to control some of the homology classes of @xmath43 , namely the fact that the natural map @xmath72 obtained by composing knneth isomorphism and inclusion is injective . as a consequence of the previous formula",
    "if @xmath73 is a curve in @xmath54 the homology class of the torus @xmath74 in @xmath43 is given by @xmath75 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n } \\mbox{lk}(\\gp , k_{j } ) [ s^{1 } \\times \\mu(k_{j})].\\ ] ]    if we apply the construction above choosing as link @xmath20 the trivial knot @xmath76 and a symplectic manifold @xmath1 , we obtain of course @xmath77 ; the advantage of the presentation ( [ glue ] ) is that we have an explicit control of the symplectic topology of the neighborhood of @xmath78 .",
    "when @xmath20 is a nontrivial fibered knot , there is only one choice for @xmath6 , and @xmath79 differs from @xmath1 by the fact that we have substituted a neighborhood of @xmath78 with a homology @xmath80 that is actually a @xmath6-bundle over @xmath81 , and has a richer topology than the product bundle .",
    "the strategy to obtain families of symplectic tori in @xmath43 follows directly from the observations above .",
    "namely , if we can identify a family @xmath82 of closed curves in @xmath54 that are transverse to the fibration , these will define symplectic tori @xmath74 in @xmath43 , as the steps leading to ( [ tra ] ) follow _",
    "verbatim_. moreover , if the @xmath73 s represent the same homology class of @xmath54 , the symplectic tori @xmath74 will represent the same homology class of @xmath43 , according to ( [ hom ] ) .",
    "if the curves @xmath73 are not isotopic ( in @xmath54 ) , it is reasonable to expect that the tori @xmath74 are not isotopic in @xmath43 either .",
    "the symplectic case of problem ( p ) for the link surgery manifold @xmath43 is transformed this way into the problem of finding homologous , nonisotopic curves in @xmath54 transverse to the fibration .",
    "* example : braiding construction 1 .",
    "* the first example we are going to consider is when @xmath20 is the unknot @xmath76 .",
    "in this case , a curve transverse to the trivial fibration of @xmath83 is just a ordinary braid ( closing to a knot @xmath73 ) having the unknot @xmath76 as axis .",
    "the number of strands of the braid determines the linking number @xmath84 and therefore the homology class of @xmath74 . by choosing @xmath1 to be the elliptic surface @xmath49",
    ", we can produce examples of symplectic tori representing some multiple of the homology class of the fiber @xmath78 , identified in ( [ glue ] ) with @xmath85 .",
    "the original examples of @xcite belong to this class .",
    "a collection of braids with @xmath86 strands which satisfies the description above is the braid presenting the @xmath87 torus knot ; figure [ tipiqu ] illustrates this braid when @xmath88 . here",
    "@xmath89 is coprime to @xmath86 , to ensure that by closing the braid we obtain a knot .     as a braid with axis the unknot @xmath76 . ]",
    "it is clear from this construction that ( at least using this approach ) we can not construct an interesting family of tori that represent the homology class of @xmath85 i.e. the class of the fiber in @xmath49 , for the simple fact that the only braid with one strand is the trivial one .",
    "this prevents us , in particular , from constructing nonisotopic symplectic representatives of a primitive homology class .",
    "* example : braiding construction 2 .",
    "* there is a way , presented in @xcite , to circumvent the difficulty of representing the fiber class , at least for @xmath90 , based on the fact that we can represent @xmath49 as link surgery manifold of the @xmath19-component link @xmath91 given by the hopf link @xmath92 plus a third component @xmath93 obtained by pushing a copy of @xmath94 along its @xmath38-framing ( a necklace with two rings ) .",
    "the observation that @xmath95 shows that , by choosing @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and as @xmath6 the spanning surface @xmath98 of @xmath99 pierced by @xmath100 we have @xmath101 , for @xmath21 at least @xmath19 . at this point",
    "we consider the family @xmath73 presented in figure [ itborr ] .",
    "to motivate such a choice , observe that each  braided block \" is given by the braid producing the borromean rings .",
    "the linking matrix of @xmath102 therefore does not depend on @xmath89 and this gives @xmath103 = \\sum_{i=1}^{3}lk(\\gamma_{p},h_{i } ) [ \\mu(h_{i } ) ] = [ \\mu(h_{1})].\\ ] ] the tori @xmath74 represent therefore the homology class of @xmath104 , identified in ( [ glue ] ) with the fiber of @xmath49 .",
    "although the @xmath73 s are homologous , the nontriviality of the borromean braid translates into the fact that they are not isotopic in @xmath54 , and we can reasonably expect that the homologous tori @xmath74 are not isotopic in @xmath49 .",
    "other constructions based on braiding , that produce symplectic representatives in various other classes of elliptic surfaces , are contained in @xcite and @xcite .    to complete the dictionary in the introduction",
    ", we have to discuss lagrangian tori .",
    "we start from the following observation .",
    "consider a curve @xmath105 , lying on a fiber @xmath106 .",
    "after dehn surgery , @xmath107 is contained in @xmath108 and satisfies therefore @xmath109 .",
    "the torus @xmath110 is therefore lagrangian , as @xmath111 and so is its image in @xmath43 after the gluing .",
    "for example , it is clear from this that the  rim torus \" @xmath112 , obtained from the trivial link surgery construction with the unknot , is lagrangian . to produce infinitely many lagrangian tori we have to look for a family @xmath73 of curves lying on a fiber of @xmath54 that are not isotopic .",
    "it is rather clear that in order to obtain such a family we need to use a knot or a link with a fiber having a richer topology than a punctured sphere .",
    "we will discuss two examples .",
    "* example : toy model .",
    "* the first example we consider is a finite toy model ( that has anyhow , as we will see later , something to teach us ) , that works for any nontrivial fibered knot @xmath76 ; in the fiber @xmath6 we consider the two homologous curves @xmath113 , a contractible curve , and a copy of the longitude of @xmath76 itself , that we denote as @xmath114 .",
    "these two curves are illustrated in figure [ general ] .",
    "as long as @xmath76 is nontrivial , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are not isotopic , as they are respectively unknotted and knotted in @xmath52 .",
    "* example : torus knots on the trefoil fiber . *",
    "the second example we consider , taken from @xcite , is an infinite family @xmath82 of curves in the fiber of the trefoil @xmath76 ( or , by simple modification , the figure eight knot or any knot containing one of these knots as murasugi - summands ) .",
    "the family is presented in the l.h.s . of figure [ torusfive ] ; it is not too hard to verify that , as a knot in @xmath52 , @xmath73 is the torus knot @xmath115 .",
    "note that in both examples above the linking number of @xmath73 and @xmath76 is @xmath38 , as @xmath73 lies in the spanning surface of @xmath76 .",
    "the lagrangian tori @xmath74 of @xmath79 are therefore nullhomologous .",
    "to obtain lagrangian tori with nontrivial homology class we can consider a @xmath3-component link given by @xmath76 and a copy @xmath116 of its meridian ; such a link admits an obvious fibration , the fiber being the spanning surface of @xmath76 pierced once by @xmath116 .",
    "( note that this is not the spanning surface of the link ; its dual cohomology class is in fact @xmath117 . ) by suitably positioning the curves @xmath73 above",
    ", we can get @xmath118 for the toy model , and @xmath119 for the trefoil case , where @xmath86 is any positive number and we require @xmath120 . the r.h.s .",
    "of figure [ torusfive ] illustrates such a case , with @xmath121 .     on a fiber of the trefoil @xmath76 ( l.h.s . ) and with linking number @xmath60 with the meridian @xmath116 ( r.h.s . ) ; here , @xmath122.,title=\"fig : \" ]   on a fiber of the trefoil @xmath76 ( l.h.s . ) and with linking number @xmath60 with the meridian @xmath116 ( r.h.s . )",

    "it is not difficult to verify that , by choosing @xmath125 , the manifold @xmath43 actually coincides with the knot surgery manifold @xmath126 .",
    "we can return now to the symplectic case to try to take advantage of the constructions of lagrangian tori .",
    "first , we want to point out that whenever we can construct a homologically essential lagrangian torus , we can make it symplectic by a perturbation of the symplectic form ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the constructions of nonisotopic lagrangian tori immediately provide examples of nonisotopic symplectic tori whenever these tori are essential ( the proof of nonisotopy depends in fact only on _ smooth _ properties of the tori ) .",
    "second , we want to take advantage of the fact , observed above , that we can find nullhomologous curves , on a fiber @xmath6 , that are nonisotopic . if we can  sum \" these curves to a fixed transverse curve , we can hope that the resulting symplectic tori inherit the nonisotopy .",
    "this is the key point of the next example .",
    "* example : cabling construction .",
    "* we can apply the idea mentioned above in the following way ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "take again a fibered knot @xmath76 and consider a copy of the longitude and a contractible curve on a fiber , as in the toy model discussed above .",
    "we denote by @xmath73 the @xmath127-cable of @xmath76 .",
    "it is easy to see that such cables , up to isotopy , are transverse to the fibration of @xmath83 , so that , in @xmath79 , the tori @xmath74 are symplectic .",
    "their homology class is as usual determined by @xmath128 , so that @xmath129 = [ s^{1 } \\times \\mu(k ) ] = [ f]$ ] .",
    "we can say that different values of @xmath89 correspond to the different number of times we have _ circle summed _ the longitude ( the @xmath130-cable ) to the meridian ( the @xmath131-cable ) .",
    "note that , also in this case , this construction makes sense only for a nontrivial @xmath76 . in a more general vein",
    ", we can consider curves , transverse to the fibration , obtained by circle summing a copy ( or @xmath86 copies ) of the meridian to nullhomologous , nonisotopic curves as the ones presented in figure [ torusfive ] .",
    "an example of that is given in figure [ gamma ] .",
    "this construction can be applied , for example , when @xmath132 ; in this case the tori represent the homology class @xmath133 $ ] of @xmath134 . in particular , this is a primitive homology class .    .",
    "the common feature of the constructions of the previous section is a family of homologous curves , transverse to , or contained in , a fiber of @xmath54 , and that are ( or at least appear ) nonisotopic .",
    "in fact , the proof of nonisotopy in @xmath54 for the examples of section [ const ] reduces to an obvious observation ( as in the case where the @xmath73 s are different torus knots ) or to the computation of the alexander polynomial of the link @xmath135 , that depends on the isotopy class of @xmath73 . however",
    ", the fact that the @xmath73 s are not isotopic does not imply that the tori @xmath136 are not isotopic , and this requires us to use a direct method to decide this question .",
    "several methods can be used .",
    "a useful approach to this question , suggested in @xcite , is based on the observation that , if two tori @xmath137 , @xmath138 are isotopic , there exist a diffeomorphism of their exteriors @xmath139 .",
    "such a diffeomorphism implies , on its own , that there exist a diffeomorphism of the manifolds that we obtain by fiber summing @xmath140 identifying @xmath137 and the fiber @xmath78 of @xmath140 , i.e. @xmath141 . a word of caution is needed here .",
    "in general , the definition of fiber sum requires a choice of a diffeomorphism between @xmath78 and @xmath137 , and a lifting of such a diffeomorphism to the ( topologically trivial ) circle bundle over these tori . in general ,",
    "such choices affect the smooth type of the resulting manifold .",
    "in particular , it is _ a priori _ impossible to establish if an isotopy between @xmath142 and @xmath143 preserves the choice of a homology basis for these tori ( as we are not assuming the stronger condition that the marked tori are images of _ isotopic embeddings _ ) , or their framing .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath140 makes the situation much simpler , as any orientation preserving diffeomorphism of @xmath144 extends to an orientation preserving diffeomorphism of @xmath145 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , so that the smooth type of @xmath141 is in fact unaffected by the choice of the gluing map , in particular it depends only on the isotopy type of @xmath137 .",
    "more is actually true , namely it depends only on the diffeomorphism type of the pair @xmath146 , or even of the exteriors ; the smooth type of @xmath141 will therefore distinguish the tori @xmath137 up to that equivalence",
    ". therefore we can try to detect the isotopy type of @xmath137 by computing the seiberg - witten invariants of @xmath141 ( i.e. the relative seiberg - witten invariants of the pair @xmath146 ) .",
    "this technique can be applied ( with various degrees of difficulty ) to all the constructions of section [ const ] , but to make the discussion more concrete , we are going to consider two explicit cases , namely the family of symplectic tori arising from the family of transverse curves @xmath73 of figure [ gamma ] , and the family of lagrangian tori arising from the family @xmath73 in the r.h.s .",
    "of figure [ torusfive ] , for the case where @xmath121 .",
    "remember than in the first case the manifold @xmath43 is the knot surgery manifold obtained from ( say ) @xmath140 and the trefoil knot @xmath76 , while in the second case @xmath43 is obtained by using two copies of @xmath140 and the link @xmath124 .",
    "let s proceed with the first case : the manifold @xmath147 , then , is itself a link surgery manifold , as it is obtained as in ( [ glue ] ) from the @xmath3-component link @xmath148 summing copies of @xmath140 along @xmath85 and @xmath74 ( as remarked above , the choice of the gluing diffeomorphism is immaterial ) .",
    "we can compute the seiberg - witten polynomial as in ( [ alex ] ) , ( using the fact that @xmath149 ) to get @xmath150 the task of computing the alexander polynomial of the link @xmath148 of figure [ gamma ] , or of other classes of links , appears discouraging .",
    "moreover , to prove that the seiberg - witten polynomial of ( [ mypol ] ) effectively distinguishes the smooth type of @xmath151 for different values of @xmath89 , we need to show that there is no automorphism of the second homology group transforming one polynomial into the other .",
    "those are not simple problems , at least in the general case .",
    "there is however a simple shortcut that we can take in order to obtain , essentially , the same kind of answer to problem ( p ) , namely exhibit infinitely many nonequivalent tori .",
    "in fact , if we are able to show that the number @xmath152 of seiberg - witten basic classes of @xmath147 satifies @xmath153 , we are granted that infinitely many among the @xmath147 are non - diffeomorphic , as @xmath154 . to prove",
    "this is a rather simpler task : in fact this amounts to showing that the number of nonzero terms of @xmath155 satisfies that property .",
    "we can simplify this task even further : using torres formula we can observe that @xmath156 as a knot in @xmath52 , @xmath73 is the torus knot @xmath115 : using the formula for the alexander polynomial of torus knots , we obtain that @xmath152 is bounded below by the number of nonzero terms in the alexander polynomial of @xmath115 , namely @xmath157 but it is at this point an easy exercise ( see @xcite ) to verify that such number grows with no bound with @xmath89 .",
    "the second case , for the lagrangian tori arising from figure [ torusfive ] , follows almost _ verbatim _ : here , the manifold @xmath147 is itself a link surgery manifold obtained as in ( [ glue ] ) from the @xmath19-component link @xmath158 summing copies of @xmath140 along @xmath85 , @xmath159 and @xmath74 .",
    "equation ( [ alex ] ) gives now @xmath160 and , again by application of torres formula , the number of basic classes of that manifold is bounded below by the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial @xmath161    to obtain the last equality we have used the fact that the pair @xmath162 is given by the torus knot @xmath115 and its meridian @xmath116 , so that @xmath163 .",
    "it is clear at this point that also in this case the number of basic classes is bounded below by ( twice ) the number of nonzero terms of the alexander polynomial of @xmath115 .",
    "we want to point out the existence of another way to use seiberg - witten theory for detecting nonisotopy of lagrangian tori , namely the lagrangian framing defect .",
    "such invariant , whose definition depends _ a priori _ on symplectic properties of a lagrangian torus , can be shown under favorable circumstances to be a smooth invariant , relating it to seiberg - witten invariants . a detailed description of this invariant appears in @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the simplest invariant that can detect nonisotopy of tori ( or other submanifolds ) , namely the fundamental group of the exterior . in this case ,",
    "different fundamental groups imply even the absence of pair homeomorphism .",
    "for some of the constructions of section [ const ] ( for example , the braiding constructions of @xcite and @xcite ) this invariant gives no information , while it is sufficient in other cases ( for example , the cabling construction , see @xcite ) to distinguish the tori even up to pair homeomorphism .",
    "we will discuss its use in the following section .",
    "all the examples discussed in the previous sections concerned the case of tori",
    ". examples of nonisotopic symplectic surfaces of genus greater than @xmath60 have been somewhat elusive ( at least in our setup ; otherwise , examples in non - simply connected manifolds have been presented in @xcite , and singular examples in @xcite ) .",
    "one of the reason for this is the difficulty in using seiberg - witten poynomials , as in section [ noniso ] , to detect potential higher genus examples built by  doubling \" the braiding constructions considered in section [ const ] . in this section we are going to discuss how we can instead double the cabling construction and retain enough information from the fundamental group of the exterior to be able to distinguish higher genus examples . for sake of simplicity we will consider just the case of genus @xmath3 , but the general case follows along the same lines . for details ,",
    "see @xcite . start by considering the knot surgery manifold @xmath126 obtained from a nontrivial fibered knot @xmath76 choosing @xmath164 .",
    "in such a manifold we can identify a symplectic surface of genus @xmath165 and self - intersection @xmath166 obtained by capping off the spanning surface @xmath6 of the knot with a @xmath166-disk section in @xmath167 , according to the gluing prescription of ( [ glue ] ) .",
    "summing such a surface with a copy of the elliptic fiber , and suitably resolving , we get a symplectic surface @xmath168 of genus @xmath169 and self - intersection @xmath38 . following",
    "@xcite we can define a symplectic , simply connected @xmath0-manifold by fiber summing two copies of @xmath126 along @xmath168 , i.e. @xmath170 identifying the two boundary components @xmath171 with a diffeomorphism that is the identity on @xmath168 and reverses the orientation on @xmath23 . in @xmath126",
    "we have the family of homologous symplectic tori @xmath74 that we introduced in section [ const ] through the cabling construction .",
    "these tori intersect the surface @xmath168 in a single transverse point , inherited from the intersection point between @xmath73 and the spanning surface of @xmath76 .",
    "it follows that in @xmath172 the two copies of @xmath74 located in each half give , by connected sum , a genus @xmath3 surface @xmath173 .",
    "we can attempt to distinguish these surfaces using the fundamental group of the exteriors @xmath174 .",
    "a rather lengthy exercise in van kampen theorem ( see @xcite ) shows that this group is given by @xmath175 i.e. the fundamental group of the homology sphere obtained by applying dehn surgery to @xmath52 along @xmath76 with slope @xmath176 .",
    "the problem of distinguishing the surfaces @xmath173 boils down therefore to showing that , for a given knot @xmath76 , infinitely many among these homology spheres are distinguished by means of their fundamental group . before commenting on that , note that if @xmath76 is the unknot , this fundamental group is always trivial : this is exactly what we expect , as it follows immediately from the construction of section [ const ] that in that case the tori @xmath74 are isotopic ( the @xmath127-cable of the unknot is isotopic to the meridian ! ) .",
    "let us return to the problem of distinguishing up to isomorphism the groups of ( [ group ] ) .",
    "we will consider here the case where @xmath76 is a fibered hyperbolic knot . in this case , with a finite number of exception , the homology spheres @xmath177 are hyperbolic @xmath19-manifolds .",
    "mostow rigidity implies in that case that these manifolds are homeomorphic if and only if their fundamental groups coincide .",
    "therefore , we are left with the problem of showing that infinitely many of the @xmath177 are not homeomorphic .",
    "but at this point we can appeal to theorem 1 of @xcite , that states that hyperbolic fillings of a hyperbolic knot exterior can be homeomorphic only if the knot is amphicheiral and the slopes are opposite . restricting ourselves to positive @xmath89 for sake of simplicity , we deduce that for all but finitely many choices of @xmath89 the fundamental group of ( [ group ] ) distinguishes ( up to homeomorphism the exteriors , hence isotopy ) the genus @xmath3 surfaces @xmath173 .",
    "an analogous result can be proven for all nontrivial fibered knots .",
