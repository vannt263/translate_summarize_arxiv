    "screenings inside the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at high temperature are dictated by thermal fluctuations of quarks and gluons , and are characterized by the electric and magnetic screening masses @xcite . from the phenomenological point of view , screening of color charge affects the force between heavy - quarks and determines the fate of heavy - quark bound states such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 inside hot qcd matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc @xcite .",
    "non - perturbative determinations of the screening masses have been attempted from various approaches in the past : use of polyakov - line correlations with appropriate projection in color space @xcite , use of correlations of spatially local operators classified in terms of euclidean time - reflection @xcite , use of dimensionally - reduced effective field theory @xcite and a direct lattice evaluation of the gluon propagator under gauge fixing @xcite .",
    "the screening masses of the @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills theory for large t hooft coupling have been also analysed on the basis of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .    in this paper , we extract electric and magnetic screening masses from gauge - invariant polyakov - line correlations in two - flavor lattice qcd simulations ( a preliminary account has been reported in @xcite ) . according to the symmetry properties under the euclidean time - reflection @xmath0 and the charge conjugation @xmath1 @xcite , we decompose the standard polyakov - line operator @xmath5 into four independent types , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . here",

    "we take the quark masses corresponding to @xmath14 and 0.80 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is pseudoscalar ( vector ) meson mass at @xmath17 .",
