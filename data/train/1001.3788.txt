    "it is thus impossible to extent the effective phonon approach to the quantum regime , which makes scpt more adequate since the latter can be derived from a purely quantum approach .",

    "@xmath96.,width=5 ]    by collecting all the quantities in the debye equation  , we finally obtain the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity from the quantum approach , which we compare in fig .  [ qkt ] with its classical counterpart . when the temperature is high enough ,",

    "@xmath99 here indicates the lower bound of the temperature range over which _",
    "umklapp _ processes  @xcite yield the dominant contribution to thermal conductivity .",
    "the existence of this peak results from a competition between the increasing behavior of the mean free path and the strongly decreasing tendency of the specific heat .",

    "in summary , scpt and ept are compared in the present study .",
    "the basic difference between scpt and ept lies in the different way to calculate the statistical average of physical quantities .",
    "specifically , the canonical average is applied in ept but gaussian average is applied in scpt .",
    "we show that both scpt and ept give the same behavior for the thermodynamic quantities of a classical system , which indicates their equivalence .",
    "it seems that gaussian average is preferable for analytical derivation , especially for models with an on - site potential , since the thermal averages should be computed in this case from numerical transfer matrix calculations .",
    "the additional gain is that scpt can be extended to study the quantum system , as shown in section ii .",
    "note that ept is based on the assumption of the equipartition theorem , whose validity in the quantum regime is broken .",
    "thus qscpt offers a simple way to explore for a given hamiltonian model the low temperature physics related to the bose - einstein statistics .",
    "we studied the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of the fpu-@xmath0 model for both the classical and quantum case .",
    "the temperature for the minimum of @xmath100 was determined from the classical scpt , which clearly shows the scaling behavior of thermal conductivity for this non - linear model .",
    "we also showed that non - equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are in good agreement with the analytical results .",
    "at the low temperature regime , the semiclassical treatment of the debye equation reproduced the _",
    "peak , a well - known characteristic observed in experimental studies .",
    "this work was supported in part by grants from the hong kong research grants council ( rgc ) and the hong kong baptist university .",
    "in this appendix , we present a simple derivation of the first order self - consistent phonon theory for 1d hamiltonian systems . the presented approach is similar to the derivation of the variational path integral method ( see  @xcite ) . in the path integral representation of quantum statistical mechanics , the @xmath101-body partition function in the canonical ensemble",

    "the idea of scpt is basically approximating the original euclidean action with a trial action that allows an exact evaluation of the trace ( [ a1 ] ) .",
