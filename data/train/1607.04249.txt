    "the light - matter coupling strength @xmath7 is several orders of magnitude smaller than the transition frequencies @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , if the system is near resonance , such that @xmath9 , the full rabi model can be simplified by applying the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) . under this approximation the so - called `` counter - rotating '' terms in eq .   can be neglected , leading to the much simpler and readily solvable jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model  @xcite @xmath10 however , the validity of the rabi model is not only restricted to cavity qed setups . the original rabi model is a ubiquitous physical model capable of describing a wide variety of other physical systems , including trapped ions @xcite , qubit - coupled nanomechanical resonators @xcite , and circuit qed systems @xcite .",
    "circuit qed architectures are particularly interesting because it is possible to reach physical regimes where the light - matter coupling strength @xmath7 becomes a sizeable fraction of the transition frequency of the boson field and/or the two - level system , meaning that the rwa is no longer a valid approximation .",
    "the influence of non - rwa terms has been studied theoretically for some time @xcite . however , with recent experimental advances in reaching `` ultra - strong '' and `` deep strong '' coupling regimes of light and matter @xcite , investigations of the full rabi model are attracting increasing attention @xcite .",
    "it has been clearly shown that in these strongly coupled quantum systems the simplified jc model no longer applies and it becomes necessary to consider the full rabi model to capture the relevant physics .",
    "the significance of non - rwa terms has also been elucidated in many - body extensions of the full rabi model , both in the equilibrium @xcite and non - equilibrium @xcite settings .",
    "another regime of significant practical interest in which the rabi model can be substantially simplified is the so - called `` dispersive regime '' @xcite . in the dispersive limit , the qubit and the boson field are far detuned compared to the light - matter coupling strength @xmath7 ,",

    "the generation of squeezed light has attracted much attention for various applications , including high - precision quantum measurements @xcite and quantum communication @xcite . in the quantum optical domain ,",
    "squeezed light has been more commonly generated using nonlinear optical processes , including degenerate parametric amplification and degenerate four - wave mixing @xcite .",

    "we embark on an alternative route to generate squeezed states of a cavity field mode dispersively coupled to a two - level system .",
    "it has been shown that in the dispersive regime beyond the rwa , the ground state of the rabi model exhibits one - mode squeezing of the boson field @xcite , but the degree of squeezing is very small . however",
    ", it has been known for a long time that any nonadiabatic change in the frequency of a harmonic oscillator ( boson field ) results in squeezing of the state of the oscillator @xcite .",
    "the degree of squeezing is particularly pronounced if the frequency change is sudden @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is possible to use periodic sudden jumps between two frequencies to produce arbitrarily large squeezing of the field mode @xcite .",
    "we show that this strategy can be used in the context of the dispersive quantum rabi model to generate significant squeezing of the field mode . comparing analytical predictions using the dispersive approximation with numerical simulations of the same protocol using the full rabi hamiltonian",
    ", we find that , remarkably , an even larger degree of squeezing arises in the latter case .",
    "an analysis of the effects of noise and imperfections suggests that considerable squeezing could be achieved with existing experimental capabilities in circuit qed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : disp ] we introduce the dispersive theory describing the interaction between a quantized bosonic mode and a single two - level system beyond the rwa .",

    "the dispersive hamiltonian consequently has the corresponding eigenstates @xmath54 hence the ground states of the dispersive hamiltonians @xmath36 take a separable form with the cavity field in a squeezed vacuum state .",
    "since a unitary transformation leaves eigenvalues unchanged , the eigenvalues of the dispersive hamiltonian may be taken as a direct approximation to the eigenvalues of the full rabi model .",
    "however , the same is _ not _ true of the eigenstates @xcite .",
    "the eigenstates of the original rabi model are related to the eigenstates of the dispersive hamiltonian through the unitary transformations @xmath42 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 to maintain consistency with the dispersive hamiltonian , which is valid to second order in @xmath7 , we expand the operator @xmath55 to first order in @xmath57 ( which are proportional to @xmath7 ) : @xmath58 for @xmath59 , the corresponding approximate eigenstates of the rabi model are @xmath60 for @xmath61 the state @xmath62 is an approximation to the ground state of the rabi hamiltonian ; we have numerically confirmed this for the parameter values used throughout the work .",
    "the state @xmath63 is a little more intriguing as it corresponds to one of the higher excited states of the rabi model ; which excited state depends on the value of @xmath21 .",

    "the second term is a squeezed number or fock state , which is an even more highly nonclassical state than the squeezed vacuum .",
    "nevertheless , a squeezed vacuum state of the field may be recovered by making a projective measurement onto the appropriate qubit state .",
    "the differences between the dispersive eigenstates and the approximate rabi eigenstates have important consequences for the generation of squeezed states of the field , as we shall see later on .    in order to quantify the degree of squeezing of the cavity field present in the the dispersive and rabi ground states , we introduce dimensionless position and momentum quadratures for the mode @xmath1",

[ sqznggrnd ] . from the figure it is evident that as the parameter @xmath85 decreases both the dispersive ground state @xmath98 and the approximate rabi ground state @xmath62 better approximate the exact ground state of the rabi model in terms of capturing the degree of squeezing @xmath80 .",
    "the degree of squeezing in the approximate and the exact ground states of the rabi model is smaller than the degree of squeezing present in the dispersive states @xmath99 .",
    "this can be understood by examining the form of eq .",

    "in the previous section we evaluated the degree of squeezing in the respective ground states of the dispersive hamiltonian and the full rabi model .",
    "unfortunately , the degree of squeezing @xmath80 is relatively low even for the largest values of the light - matter coupling strength @xmath7 for which the dispersive approximation holds . in this section",

    "the basis of our protocol is a scheme detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which uses sudden changes in the frequency of a harmonic oscillator to generate arbitrarily strong squeezing of the oscillator state .",
    "we show that this scheme can be directly realised within the dispersive hamiltonian , using the interaction of the qubit with the field mode to create the required frequency shifts . the use of a dispersively coupled qubit distinguishes our proposal from that of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the repeated frequency shift protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite was shown to produce squeezed states in a nonlinear superconducting oscillator .    to begin with we re - express the hamiltonian in terms of position and momentum coordinates for mode  @xmath1 :",
    "@xmath110 so that the dispersive hamiltonian of eq .   can be written as @xmath111 within each qubit subspace the hamiltonian of the field takes the form of a harmonic oscillator of unit mass and shifted oscillation frequency @xmath112 .",

    "since the qubit state determines the frequency shift of the mode , flipping the qubit results in a sudden change in the frequency of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "it has been shown that a suitably timed sequence of sudden frequency changes is capable of generating arbitrarily large squeezing of a field mode  @xcite . in our coupled light - matter system , the dispersive interaction together with qubit flips provides the mechanism for changing the frequency of the field mode .",
    "for the sake of completeness we briefly summarize the main steps of the protocol developed in ref .",
    "@xcite within the context of our system .",
    "* we assume that for @xmath124 the system is prepared in the ground state of the dispersive hamiltonian @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is defined as the ground state of the frequency - shifted oscillator potential @xmath127 .",
    "* at @xmath118 the qubit is suddenly flipped to its excited state @xmath45 .",
    "immediately following the qubit flip , although the expectation values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 for the field remain unchanged , the field state is squeezed _ relative to the new potential _ @xmath130 .",
    "* the joint state evolves under the hamiltonian @xmath131 for a time duration @xmath132 .",
    "* after the time delay @xmath132 , the qubit is suddenly flipped back to its ground state @xmath46 .",
    "this creates a second sudden frequency jump from @xmath133 , following which the state of the field is squeezed with respect to the potential @xmath127 . * the first cycle of the protocol finishes with allowing the joint state to evolve under the hamiltonian @xmath134 for a duration @xmath135 .",
    "* by carefully choosing @xmath136 and repeating the above steps @xmath137 times very strong squeezing of the field mode @xmath1 can be generated .",
    "these steps are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sqzng1cycle ] .",
    "as long as we are working within the dispersive hamiltonian , the above protocol is directly analogous to the harmonic oscillator with time - dependent frequency envisioned by janszky and adam @xcite .",
    "following their heisenberg - picture analysis , we arrive at the following expressions for the time - evolved operators @xmath138 after one cycle of the protocol : @xmath139 the operators for the @xmath140 potential immediately following the second qubit flip are given by @xmath141   \\end{split } \\\\",

    "if @xmath145 no squeezing is generated by the protocol .",
    "maximal squeezing is obtained when @xmath146 . likewise , if the protocol is to be further repeated it is critical to choose @xmath147 . from now on we therefore fix @xmath148 .",
    "the time evolved position and momentum quadratures defined with respect to the mode with frequency @xmath140 then become @xmath149 the corresponding variances of the quadrature operators are given by @xmath150 which clearly illustrates that the protocol decreases quantum noise beyond the standard quantum limit in the momentum quadrature at the expense of increased fluctuations in the position quadrature of the field mode .",
    "this protocol can be repeated to produce even greater squeezing : after @xmath137 cycles the variances are given by @xmath151 and @xmath152 .    unlike the proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite , the time - dependent frequency changes in our system are achieved via an effective interaction with a qubit .",

    "involves manipulating the state of the system , working with the rabi hamiltonian itself will give different results than working with the dispersive hamiltonian . in order to analyze the outcome of the protocol using the rabi hamiltonian , it is useful to work in the schrdinger picture rather than the heisenberg picture used previously .    in the schrdinger picture ,",
    "one cycle of the protocol based on the dispersive hamiltonian as described above results in the state @xmath162 the protocol may be carried out similarly using the rabi hamiltonian ; however , this does result in some deviation from the ideal case using the dispersive hamiltonian .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the initial state for the rabi protocol is the ground state of the rabi hamiltonian . as is evident from the approximate solution in eq .  , this state is not an eigenstate of the qubit operator @xmath163 ; rather than being a separable state of qubit and field with the qubit in @xmath46 , the rabi ground state has a component along @xmath45 .",
    "however , provided that the parameter regime is chosen such that the dispersive approximation holds , the @xmath45 component is small and will not have a significant negative impact on the degree of squeezing produced by the protocol .",
    "as in the dispersive case , the first step of the protocol is to flip the state of the qubit by applying the @xmath164 operator . of course , this does not result in a state that is purely along @xmath45 , but again the error induced is small .",
    "the flipped state is now allowed to evolve under the full rabi hamiltonian for a time @xmath165 . following this evolution ,",

    "the evolution time intervals @xmath136 remain the same as in the dispersive case , to a good approximation .",
    "this is because the evolution time is related to the differences in energy eigenvalues , which are effectively the same in the dispersive and rabi cases provided that the parameters are chosen suitably .",
    "the resultant state after one cycle of the protocol is then given by @xmath167 of course , the protocol may then be repeated multiple times in a similar fashion .",

    "it is clear that in both cases the degree of squeezing increases linearly with the number of cycles .",
    "remarkably , fig .",
    "[ fiddisprabi ] shows that the protocol using the rabi hamiltonian produces considerably more squeezing per cycle ( approximately twice as much , for these parameters ) than the `` ideal '' dispersive case .",
    "this is particularly surprising since the ground state of the rabi model shows less squeezing than the dispersive ground state , which can be attributed to the higher variance of the mode state associated with the @xmath45 state of the qubit as discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : disp ] .",

    "however , the overall increase in squeezing in the rabi case can be attributed to the very large degree of squeezing of the @xmath46 component . clearly ,",

    "in a realistic setting the protocol presented in the previous section will suffer from losses and imperfections .",
    "qubit dephasing and relaxation , cavity losses , timing jitter , and the inability to instantaneously flip the state of the qubit will all affect the outcome of the protocol . we briefly discuss each of these sources of error with an eye toward circuit qed experiments , but their relative contributions will depend on the particular experimental implementation .    in the dispersive version of the protocol ,",
    "the qubit is always in one of its eigenstates , meaning that the protocol is unaffected by dephasing and only the energy relaxation time @xmath171 needs to be considered .",
    "the rabi case is a little more complicated and qubit dephasing may contribute to noise .",
    "however , it is important to note that the qubit need only remain coherent over the evolution time interval @xmath136 rather than throughout the full @xmath137 cycles of the protocol . to take some numbers relevant to superconducting circuit qed experiments , choosing a cavity frequency @xmath172  ghz and a coupling strength @xmath173 gives @xmath136 on the order of nanoseconds . given that superconducting qubits are now routinely achieving relaxation and dephasing times of several tens of microseconds @xcite , it is clear that qubit losses are not expected to be a limiting factor for the protocol or the degree of squeezing that can be achieved .",
    "the loss of photons from the cavity has a more severe effect . to incorporate photon losses in the squeezing protocol",
    "we use a standard master equation approach @xcite , assuming that during the time intervals @xmath136 the field mode couples to a zero temperature reservoir with damping rate @xmath174 .",
    "figure 6 shows the results of a master equation simulation with @xmath175 . in the presence of photon loss the degree of squeezing",

    "it is worth noting that this value of @xmath174 corresponds to a cavity q of about 150 , which is two orders of magnitude less than q - factors routinely achieved for microwave resonators in circuit qed @xcite and similar to the value recently measured for a qubit - coupled nanomechanical resonator @xcite .",
    "the protocol also requires carefully designed time delays to ensure maximum squeezing of the field mode . in order to model the effect of inaccuracies in timing , we add a random offset @xmath176 , chosen from a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath177 , to each time delay @xmath136",

    "figure  [ errorwithtime ] shows the average degree of squeezing @xmath178 when photon losses and random time delay are incorporated in our protocol . when the error in timing is on the order of 1  % , the timing jitter has little effect on the degree of squeezing .",
    "however , larger timing errors ( on the order of 10  % ) dramatically reduce the degree of squeezing produced .",
    "hence the ability to control the timing of qubit flips to a reasonably precise degree will be important for experimental implementations of our protocol .     produced by @xmath137 cycles of the rabi protocol .",
    "the three lower curves show the effect of photon loss together with three different degrees of timing imperfections : photon loss alone with no timing error ( brown , triangles ) , photon loss plus random timing errors chosen from a gaussian distribution of width @xmath179 ( yellow , crosses ) , and photon loss plus random timing errors with distribution width @xmath180 ( cyan , open circles ) . for comparison , the ideal case is also shown ( black , filled dots ) .",
    "the photon loss rate is @xmath175 ; other physical parameters are given by @xmath181.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the foregoing calculations have relied on the assumption of instantaneous flips of the qubit state , which produce sudden changes in the frequency of the oscillator .",
    "a sudden frequency change is of course an idealization for a finite but small switching time @xmath182 .",
    "as long as @xmath183 , a sudden frequency change from @xmath184 is a good approximation @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that @xmath185 ; therefore the requirement for very small values of @xmath182 can be relaxed by decreasing the light - matter coupling @xmath7 and increasing the number of cycles @xmath137 to achieve a similar degree of squeezing of the cavity field .",
    "moreover , modifications to the sudden frequency shift scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite have been discussed in the literature .",
    "the case of a sinusoidal frequency modulation was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a fourier - modified janszky - adam scheme for improved nonadiabatic generation of squeezed photons was proposed in ref .",
    "while these schemes are not as efficient as the original sudden jump protocol , they are less demanding from an experimental standpoint and still produce significant squeezing of the cavity field .",
    "in this work we have theoretically explored the potential for generating strong squeezing of a boson field mode interacting with a two - level system in the dispersive regime , without making the rwa .",
    "although the ground state of this hybrid quantum system exhibits squeezing of the field , the degree of squeezing is not large .",
    "however , the dispersive frequency shift allows the frequency of the cavity mode to be changed by flipping the state of the qubit . a protocol based on a series of suitably timed sudden frequency jumps",
    "can be used to produce an arbitrarily large degree of squeezing in the absence of noise . even in the presence of a realistic level of noise and experimental imperfections ,",
    "the degree of squeezing produced by this protocol can be significant .",
    "one possible advantage of this method of squeezing generation compared to the use of a parametric amplifier and/or other nonlinearity based methods is that under our protocol the degree of squeezing and the time of generation are directly controlled by the number of frequency shifts applied .                              c. rigetti",
