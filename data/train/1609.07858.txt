    "<S> these properties can be guaranteed by imposing step - size restrictions on the methods . to qualitatively describe the step - size restrictions , </S>",

    "<S> theorems involving sign conditions on certain linear recursions associated to the lmm have been proposed in the literature that allow us to answer the above questions : the difficulty with these theorems is that there are in general infinitely many sign conditions to be verified . in this work we present methods to rigorously check the sign conditions . as an illustration </S>",
