    "since the discovery of the @xmath3 in 1974  @xcite , measurements of its total width ( @xmath11 ) , and partial decay widths into hadrons ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath1 ( @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , and the corresponding branching fractions , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , have been carried out [ 2@xmath1910 ] .",
    "the results of these experiments differ on both decay widths and branching fractions .",
    "the parameters are of particular interest because , for instance , @xmath20 is used in reconstructing @xmath21 mesons for @xmath22 violation measurements @xcite , and @xmath23 is often used to determine the total number of @xmath3 events in @xmath3 branching fraction measurements due to its large branching fraction and straightforward detection .",
    "therefore , it is important to measure these decay widths and branching fractions with better accuracy .",
    "twenty four center - of - mass energy points were scanned in the vicinity of the @xmath3 peak ranging from 3.67 gev to 3.71 gev .",
    "the data were collected with the besii ( beijing spectrometer ) detector at the bepc ( beijing electron positron collider ) storage ring .",
    "the besii detector is described in detail in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , separated - beam data were taken at the first and the last points for background studies .",
    "the total integrated luminosity was 1149 nb@xmath24 .",
    "the following four reactions are studied : @xmath25    for the selection of lepton - pair final states , two charged tracks with total charge zero are required . for @xmath2 events , the acollinearity must be less than 10 degrees .",
    "in addition , in order to suppress cosmic ray background , the time - of - flight measurements of the two muon - candidates must satisfy @xmath26(ns ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mutof ] .",
    "further , the muon counter hit information is used to identify di - muon events from other back - to - back two - prong final states , and this requires @xmath27 due to the limited solid angle coverage .    to separate electrons from muons and hadrons , the energies deposited by the two tracks in the barrel shower counter ( bsc ) must satisfy @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the normalized energy deposited .",
    "we also require @xmath30 , and because the monte carlo simulation does not model the energy deposited well in the rib region of the bsc , an additional cut is applied on the @xmath31-coordinate of the first hit layer : @xmath32 or @xmath33 m.     times of flight for @xmath34-pairs .",

    "events with all tracks pointing to the same hemisphere in the @xmath31 direction are removed to suppress beam - associated background . for two - prong events ,",
    "two additional cuts are applied to eliminate possible lepton pair background .",
    "the number of photons must be greater than one , and the acollinearity between two charged tracks , @xmath39 , must be greater than 10 degrees .",
    "a comparison between data and monte carlo samples satisfied the foregoing selection criteria is shown in fig .",
    "[ hadcmp ] .",
    "the background from @xmath53 decay is difficult to distinguish from direct hadronic decay events , so the contribution from this source , @xmath54 , is estimated using @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the integrated luminosity at each energy point , @xmath57 the qed production cross section at this energy point , and @xmath58 the acceptance of our hadron event selection criteria for @xmath53 events .",
    "this is subtracted from the observed number of hadron events .",
    "a similar subtraction is performed for the other surviving backgrounds , such as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and the two - photon process ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "therefore , the corrected number of hadron events , @xmath62 , is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of events that satisfy the hadron event selection cuts .",

    "the numbers in parenthesis denote the relative errors .",
    "the results of the fit for decay widths and branching fractions are given in table  [ fitres ] , together with corresponding pdg @xcite values for comparison .",
    "the errors are the sum in quadrature of statistical , fitting , and systematic uncertainties , including those from acceptance uncertainties , luminosity uncertainties , and a center - of - mass energy uncertainty of 0.10 mev  @xcite .",
    "the systematic error for @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath15 is ( @xmath69 ) % , 3.2 % and ( @xmath70 ) % , respectively .",
    "the correlation coefficients between directly fitted parameters obtained from the fitting are utilized in the calculation of the errors of indirectly determined parameters such as @xmath12 and branching fractions . for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , the uncertainty related to the common error from the luminosity measurement cancels out .    as a check of the fitting procedure ,",
    "@xmath72 was also determined by a simpler approach . in this approach , the distribution of @xmath74 versus energy was fit with the shape determined from @xmath75 versus scan energy plus a polynomial to represent the continuum process to determine the number of hadrons coming from @xmath76 decays .",
    "using the ratio of the total number of @xmath75 events corrected by their detection efficiency and the number of @xmath76 hadronic decays corrected by their detection efficiency , we directly determine @xmath72 , which agrees very well with the result from the full fitting procedure .    the assumption that lepton pairs couple to the @xmath3 only via an intermediate photon  @xcite implies the existence of the decay @xmath77 hadrons with a branching fraction : @xmath78 which corresponds to a width @xmath79 of @xmath80 kev .",
    "the @xmath3 lepton width @xmath81 kev obtained in this measurement agrees with the bes previous value of @xmath82 kev  @xcite , within the error .",
    "in addition , this is the first direct measurement to the decay width of @xmath83 , and the precision of @xmath72 is much better than previous measurements and the current pdg value .",
