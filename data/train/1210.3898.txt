    "it has been rather established that the entangled polymer dynamics can be reasonably described by single chain models where the effect of entanglement is replaced by dynamical constraints such as tubes or slip - links@xcite . for instance , several single chain models@xcite have been proposed to reproduce viscoelasticity , diffusion , dielectric relaxation , etc , by taking account the relevant relaxation mechanisms such as the reptation@xcite , contour length fluctuation@xcite and thermal@xcite and convective constraint releases@xcite .    despite the successes of these single chain models , the linkage between the single chain models and the real situation with multi - chains has not been clarified yet . there have been lots of attempts to extract the parameters for single chain model from multi - chain molecular simulations where the entanglement effect is naturally taken into account by the hard - core ( excluded volume ) interaction@xcite . specifically , the primitive path analysis@xcite is a realization of the original idea of entanglement , and thus , it is promising not only to extract the parameters , also to clarify the microscopic picture ( or definition ) of the entanglement .",
    "even if some parameters in single chain models are extracted by the primitive path analysis , there are still some fundamental difficulties . in most cases ,",
    "the mean - field type single chain description is assumed rather a priori , and the assumptions employed in the single chain models have not been fully justified yet .",
    "for instance , mapping of the cross - correlation between different chains@xcite ) to the single chain models has not been clarified yet .",
    "thus a model which needs fewer assumptions and based on realistic molecular picture is demanding .",
    "a possible approach in the niche between multi - chain and single chain pictures is the multi - chain model where the entanglement is not described by the hard - core interaction but by a coarse - grained manner similar to the single - chain models@xcite .",
    "actually we have developed such a model called the primitive chain network ( pcn ) model ( also referred as naples code ) where phantom chains are bundled by slip - links to form a network in 3d space@xcite .",
    "the pcn simulations have been performed for several systems such as linear polymers@xcite , symmetric and asymmetric stars@xcite , comb branch polymer@xcite , polymer blends@xcite , and copolymers@xcite , and it has been showed that the pcn simulations can reproduce various rheological properties reasonably .",
    "moreover , even under large and fast deformations@xcite the pcn simulations show reasonable consistency with experiments . to locate the pcn model between multi - chain and single chain models ,",
    "we have reported a comparison with single chain models on bidisperse blends@xcite and a comparison with molecular simulations on the network statistics@xcite .",
    "however , the total free energy of the system in the pcn model is not well - defined @xcite , because the equations describing dynamics are not based on the free energy nor the detail balance .",
    "( this is because the pcn dynamics was modeled rather empirically . ) as a result , comparison of some static properties of the pcn model with the other models is essentially difficult .    in this study",
    ", we newly propose another multi - chain model based on the entanglement picture , which is the multi - chain slip - spring model inspired by the single chain slip - spring model proposed by likhtman several years ago@xcite .",
    "differently from the pcn model , we define the total free energy for the new model , and we employ dynamics model ( a time evolution equation and stochastic processes ) which satisfies the detailed balance condition . thus our model reproduces the thermal equilibrium which is characterized by the free energy . in the present paper ,",
    "we report all the equations to construct the model , and also a numerical scheme to implement a simulation code . then some preliminary results for such as the chain dimension , the linear viscoelasticity and the center - of - mass diffusion , obtained by the simulations , are reported .",
    "figure [ fig : model ] shows schematic view of the model employed in this study .",
    "we consider a network composed of bead - spring chains connected by slip - springs in a volume @xmath4 .",
    "we describe the number of chains in the system as @xmath5 , and the number of beads in a chain as @xmath6 .",
    "the beads are connected along the chain backbone by linear entropic springs characterized by the average bond size @xmath7 , and chains essentially behave as ideal , rouse type chains .",
    "apart from the chain connectivity , some of the beads are connected to the other beads by the slip - springs to mimic the entanglement between chains .",
    "following the previous works@xcite , we treat the degrees of freedom of slip - spring as state variables , which obey the maxwell - boltzmann type statistics in equilibrium . that is , we assume that the equilibrium probability distribution of the state variables is described by the boltzmann weight with the ( effective ) free energy . the ends of slip - springs move ( slip ) along the chain to reproduce the chain slippage via entanglements . instead of the continuous sliding dynamics proposed in the original single - chain model@xcite",
    ", we introduce the discrete hopping dynamics for the end of slip - spring between neighboring beads@xcite .",
    "the slip - springs are stochastically destroyed when one of the ends is at the chain ends , and they are also stochastically constructed at the chain ends with a certain probability . for the spring force for slip - springs ,",
    "we employ the linear entropic spring force ( the strength of this entropic spring is characterized by the slip - spring parameter @xmath8 . )",
    "it has been already pointed that slip - links or slip - springs effectively give attractive interaction between polymers and thus the statistical properties of polymer chains are affected by slip - springs@xcite .",
    "we introduce a repulsive interaction between beads to compensate this attractive interaction induced by the slip - springs and to recover the ideal chain statistics .",
    "the number density of the slip - spring , @xmath9 , is another parameter to control the strength of the entanglement effect , which is related to the entanglement density .",
    "the state variables of the system are the position of beads , @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the indices for chain and bead position on the chain , respectively ) , the total number of slip - springs in the system @xmath13 , and the connection matrix of slip - springs @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the index for slip - spring and the definition of @xmath16 is given later ) .",

    "( as we mentioned , we assume that the system state , including the slip - springs , is characterized by the free energy . ) for simplicity , we do not introduce restriction for the slip - spring configurations ( connectivity ) .",
    "for example , we allow multiple slip - springs to share the same bead , or allow slip - springs to connect two beads on the same chain . because both ends of a slip - spring are attached to beads , we need four indices to specify the state of a slip - spring .",
    "hereafter , we describe the @xmath12-th bead on the @xmath11-th chain as @xmath21 , and the state of the @xmath15-th slip - spring as @xmath22 where the ends of the slip - spring are located at the bead @xmath23 and the bead @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that there is no specific interaction between slip - springs .",
    "( this assumption is the same as one employed in single chain models , where slip - springs behave as one dimensional ideal gas@xcite . )",
    "the number of slip - springs is not constant and it is controlled by the effective chemical potential for slip - springs@xcite . because slip - springs are statistically independent each other , for a given polymer conformation , the probability distribution of the slip - spring state is given by @xmath25\\ ] ] where @xmath26 represents the conditional probability of @xmath27 under a given @xmath28 , @xmath13 is the total number of slip - springs in the system , and @xmath29 is the parameter related to the spring constant of slip - spring , and @xmath30 is the effective chemical potential for slip - springs .",

    "the repulsive potential is a soft - core gaussian type and similar to the flory - krigbaum potential@xcite .",

    "namely , both models do not require any artificial objects which represent the uncrossability ( such as slip - springs in our model ) .",
    "we should also mention that there are no artificial attraction between chains in the twentanglement model , and thus the repulsive interaction is not required unlike our model . in these aspects ,",
    "the twentanglement model is located in between the kremer - grest model and our model .",
    "masubuchi et al@xcite have developed another multi - chain model called the primitive chain network ( pcn ) model as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the model presented in this work and the pcn model are similar to each other ; in both models , phantom chains are connected to form a network , and the entanglement is mimicked by bundling of segments rather artificially .",
    "the reconstruction of entanglement is assumed to occur only at the chain ends as considered in the tube theory .",
    "one fundamental difference is the level of description . in the pcn model ,",
    "only the number of kuhn segments between entanglements is used and the position of each segment is not monitored .",
    "thus , the pcn model can not deal with the dynamics and structure in the time and length scales below those of entanglement . on the contrary , in the present model the dynamics of segments between entanglements",
    "is considered explicitly .",
    "this difference gives a difference in computational costs .",
    "the computational cost of the pcn is much smaller than one of the present model , as shown later .",
    "another difference is the thermodynamic consistency , which is fully considered in the present model while not in the pcn model .",
    "the reconstruction of entanglements in the pcn model does not fulfill the detailed balance condition , for example@xcite .",
    "finally , we point that the strength of dynamical constraint is different ; the slip - link employed in pcn corresponds to the limit of @xmath152 for the slip - spring of the present model .",
    "this difference may affect some properties such as the orientation tensor under deformations@xcite .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the presented model is the many chain version of the likhtman s single chain model@xcite where several slip - springs are connected to a single rouse chain . in the likhtman s model ,",
    "one end of a slip - spring can slide along the chain contour while another end is fixed in space .",
    "it the present model , on the other hand , both ends of a slip - spring can slide along chains . as we shall discuss later",
    ", this difference affects the effective strength of the dynamical constraint to the chain dynamics .",
    "another difference between the two models is that the number of springs ( standing for entanglements ) is assumed to be constant in likhtman s model while it fluctuates in the present model since it is controlled via the chemical potential .",
    "it is also pointed that there are a couple of differences in the sliding rule for slip - springs along the chain . as we mentioned , our slip - spring hops between segments while likhtman s slip - spring actually slides on the bond between segments .",
    "( however , the difference between the hopping on beads and sliding along the bond between segments seems to have minor effects to dynamical properties , as judged from single chain simulation results@xcite . ) furthermore , in likhtman s model the slip - springs are allowed neither to change their order along the chain nor to overlap with each other , while in our model the motion of slip - spring is completely independent .",
    "it should be noted that there have been proposed several single chain slip - link models with the thermodynamic consistency .",
    "schieber et al@xcite have proposed such models where the state variables are chosen as the number of entanglement , the position of entanglement and the number of monomers between entanglements .",
    "this choice of state variables is similar to one of the pcn model , but fundamental difference is that these models have well - defined free energy free energy of the system .",
    "the dynamic equations or transition rates are derived from the free energy and the detailed balance condition .",
    "the chemical potential controls the fluctuation of number of entanglements and this strategy is employed in our model . due to the nature of the single chain model",
    ", it is intrinsically difficult to deal with the effect of surrounding chains .",
    "( although several attempts have been made to overcome this difficulty@xcite , some additional and non - trivial assumptions are required to mimic multi chain effects . )",
    "monodisperse linear polymers were examined where bead number per chain @xmath6 was varied from 4 to 64 .",
    "the total number of beads in the system , @xmath153 , is fixed to be constant so that the bead number density was constant at @xmath154 .",
    "periodic boundary condition was utilized with the box dimension at @xmath155 .",
    "the spring strength parameter @xmath29 for slip - springs was set as @xmath156 .",
    "the number density of slip - springs was chosen as @xmath157 .",
    "conceptually , this slip - spring density give a certain plateau modulus but we have not yet obtained the relation between the plateau modulus and these parameters .",
    "the cut - off parameter and the corresponding cut - off distance were @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "the friction coefficient for the slip - spring was set as @xmath160 .",
    "for the numerical calculation @xmath115 was chosen as @xmath161 , after we checked reasonable numerical convergence for @xmath162 .",
    "in this subsection static properties of the system is examined to show the consistency between simulation data and the equilibrium distribution function given by eq .",
    "figure [ fig : re2 ] shows the bond number @xmath163 dependence of squared end - to - end distance @xmath164 to report that the scaling obeys the gaussian chain statistics .",
    "the internal chain structure is examined via the internal distance factor @xmath165 defined as @xmath166 , and shown in figure [ fig : ds ] .",
    "@xmath165 is reasonably close to unity independently of @xmath167 and @xmath6 as expected for the gaussian chain statistics .",
    "these results demonstrate that the attractive force induced by the slip - springs is correctly compensated by the repulsive interaction .",
    "a similar attempt has been made for pcn model where the soft core repulsive interaction was introduced between slip - links@xcite , but a precise control of the chain dimension was difficult due to the lack of free energy expression for pcn model .",
    "( indeed , it seems practically impossible to introduce the repulsive potential which exactly cancels the artificial attractive interaction in slip - link models such as the pcn model@xcite . )",
    "figure [ fig : zc ] shows the distribution of slip - spring number per chain @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",
    "the grand canonical type treatment of the slip - springs for single chain models predict the poisson distribution for the number of slip - springs on a chain@xcite .",
    "indeed , the results shown by symbols reasonably close to the poisson distribution drawn by solid curves where the average value of @xmath168 is given as @xmath170 and @xmath171 for the examined chains with @xmath172 and @xmath173 , for the simulation parameter @xmath174 ( calculated from the slip - spring density and the bead density as @xmath175 ) .      figure [ fig : msd ] shows the mean square displacement of the central bead in the chain , @xmath176 . to see the effect of the entanglement clearly , the data divided by the rouse behavior in internal time range @xmath177 is also shown . from these plots , it is apparent that the entanglement effect appears after @xmath178 where the negative slope starts in @xmath177 . in this respect ,",
    "the short chain with @xmath179 does not show the entangled behavior , in spite of the fact that there exist two slip - springs per chain on average as shown in fig [ fig : zc ] .",
    "figure [ fig : d ] shows the diffusion coefficient @xmath180 against the bead number @xmath6 . to see the scaling behavior clearly ,",
    "@xmath181 is also shown .",
    "the rouse behavior @xmath182 is observed below @xmath179 , which is consistent with what observed for @xmath176 . for longer chains ,",
    "the @xmath6 dependence is not that strong and actually the power law exponent does not largely deviate from @xmath183 even for @xmath184 , which is somewhat weaker than experimental results for well entangled systems@xcite . in comparison with the literature data ( shown by cross in the right panel ) for single chain slip - spring model@xcite with similar parameter setting ( except the difference in @xmath185 that is @xmath186 for our simulation while it is @xmath187 for the single chain data ) , it is suggested that the dynamical constraint in the present model is weaker than that in the single chain model .",
    "we expect that this is due to the difference in the hopping ( sliding ) kinetics of slip - springs . in our model",
    "the both ends of slip - springs are mobile while in the single chain models one end is anchored , as we mentioned in section [ sec : comp ] .",
    "this difference will result in a weaker constraint to the chain in our model .",
    "indeed , similar behavior is observed in the @xmath6 dependence of the longest relaxation time for the end - to - end vector , @xmath188 , shown in fig [ fig : tau ] .",
    "especially , @xmath189 indicates that the large @xmath6 chains examined here are still in the transitional region between unentangled and entangled regimes .",
    "figure [ fig : gt ] shows the relaxation modulus @xmath190 calculated by the linear response theory shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : gt ] . here",
    ", @xmath190 is normalized by the unit modulus defined as @xmath191@xcite . as in the case of the mean square displacement",
    ", we also show the data divided by the rouse behavior , @xmath192 . as we have observed for @xmath176 ,",
    "the entanglement effect ( the increase of @xmath193 in time ) is not observed in short chains . on the other hand , for longer chains",
    "@xmath190 apparently deviates from the rouse relaxation to show the plateau , as expected .",
    "we note that the unit modulus @xmath194 is not equal to the plateau modulus @xmath195 and actually @xmath195 is much smaller than @xmath194 .",
    "( this is because @xmath196 is a characteristic modulus for the bead scale , and it reflects the short time relaxation modes . ) for the single chain model it is reported that @xmath197@xcite .",
    "our results for long chains are similar to this relation .",
    "of course , the relation between @xmath198 and @xmath196 depends on the model and various parameters .",
    "the direct comparison of our result with the single chain simulation results seems to be difficult . as we mentioned ,",
    "there are two possible expressions for the stress tensor of the system .",
    "to investigate how the expression of the stress tensor affects the rheological properties , here we compare the shear relaxation moduli calculated with two different expressions .",
    "figure [ fig : gt_virtual ] shows the shear relaxation moduli for @xmath199 and 64 calculated by eqs ( symbol ) and ( solid curve ) . although the shear relaxation moduli data by eqs and are quantitatively different , they are qualitatively similar , as reported in the single chain model.@xcite    figure [ fig : gtcomp ] shows a comparison with the kremer - grest simulations@xcite on @xmath190 . here ,",
    "@xmath190 of our simulation is calculated by eq , but similar fitting can be realized for @xmath190 obtained by eq as well , if the parameters are adequately tuned ( not shown here ) .",
    "there are small discrepancies in the short time region due to the difference in the level of coarse - graining , i.e. , the number of rouse modes . this discrepancy may be eliminated if @xmath200 value is increased as reported in the single chain model .",
    "for this fitting , we choose the parameters as follows .",
    "@xmath201 here , @xmath202 is the number of beads ( molecular weight ) of the kremer - grest model which corresponds to one bead in our model , @xmath203 is the unit time in the kremer - grest simulation ( the standard time scale for particles with the lennard - jones potential ) , and @xmath204 is the unit modulus for the kremer - grest model@xcite .",
    "this fitting demonstrates that the dynamical constraint given by the slip - spring is relatively weak , and this result is consistent with results obtained by @xmath180 and @xmath188 .",
    "for instance , it has been reported that the entanglement number for the kremer - grest chain with 200 beads is around 5@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the corresponding chain in our model is @xmath184 that has @xmath171 slip - springs per chain on average , as shown in fig [ fig : zc ] .",
    "since the @xmath190 data compared here are in the transitional regime and the contribution from the rouse relaxation is relatively large , the fitting results ( eq ) may be different for well - entangled systems .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that @xmath200 is smaller than the effective entanglement bead number is informative . for this specific case , the effective entanglement bead number in our model is roughly estimated as @xmath205 . a similar result have been reported for the pcn model@xcite , and such a discrepancy is expected to be the nature of randomly connected multi chain network . from the similarity between our model and the pcn model , where the entanglements are not fixed in space , we consider the obtained results are reasonable . in order to compare the computation cost ( efficiency ) of our model , we report cpu times for several different simulation models on a pc ( intel xeon x5570 2.93ghz , cent os 4 ) .",
    "we chose a melt of kremer - grest chains with bead number @xmath206 as a reference , and made calculations by the present model and by the pcn model for similar systems .",
    "each simulation was performed for time steps comparable to the longest relaxation time .",
    "all the simulations were performed by serial simulation codes .",
    "the kremer - grest simulation was made by cognac ver 7.1.1@xcite .",
    "the other simulations were performed by our home - made simulation codes . for a kremer - grest simulation with",
    "the chain number @xmath207 , the required time steps is about @xmath208 and the cpu time was @xmath209 hours . for our model ,",
    "a simulation with @xmath184 , @xmath210 , @xmath174 and @xmath211 , required the @xmath212 time steps and the cpu time was @xmath213 minutes . for a pcn simulation with the average segment number of segments per chain @xmath214 and the number of chains @xmath215 required @xmath216 time steps for the relaxation and the cpu time was @xmath217 minutes . from these results",
    ", we can conclude that the computational cost ( efficiency ) of our model is in between the kremer - grest model and the pcn model .",
    "judging from the coarse - graining level of these models , this result is reasonable .",
    "in this study , we proposed the multi - chain slip - spring model where the bead - spring chains are dispersed in space and connected by slip - springs .",
    "the entanglement effect is mimicked by the slip - springs and not by the hard - core ( excluded volume ) interaction between beads .",
    "our model is located in the niche of the modeling of entangled polymer dynamics between conventional multi - chain simulations and single chain models . in our model ,",
    "the set of state variables are the position of beads and the connectivity ( bead indices ) of the slip - springs . differently from the primitive chain network model ( that is the other class of multi - chain model ) ,",
    "the total free energy of the system is well - defined , and kinetic equations are designed based on the free energy and the detailed balance condition .",
    "the free energy includes the repulsive interaction between beads , which compensate the attractive interaction artificially generated by the slip - springs .",
    "the explicit expression of linear relaxation modulus was also derived by the linear response theory .",
    "a possible numerical scheme was proposed and simulations reproduced expected bead number dependence in transitional regime between rouse and entangled dynamics for the chain structure , the central bead diffusion and the linear relaxation modulus .    in this model",
    "there are a couple of parameters ( @xmath8 , @xmath185 , @xmath218 and @xmath9 ) of which effect on chain dynamics is not well understood",
    ". it would be an interesting work to explore the effects of these parameters by theoretical methods as well as simulations .",
    "we are performing simulations to scan these parameters and compare the resulting chain dynamics with the other models and experiments .",
    "another interesting topic is on the extension of this model by using its multi - chain nature , as reported for pcn model , to branch polymers , blends and copolymers , etc .",

    "<S> the set of state variables are the position of beads and the connectivity ( indices ) of the slip - springs between beads . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the system is described by the time evolution equation and stochastic transition dynamics for these variables . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a simple model which is based on the well - defined total free - energy and the detailed balance condition . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy in our model contains a repulsive interaction between beads , which compensate the attractive interaction artificially generated by the slip - springs . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit expression of linear relaxation modulus is also derived by the linear response theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a possible numerical scheme to perform simulations . </S>",
    "<S> simulations reproduced expected bead number dependence in transitional regime between rouse and entangled dynamics for the chain structure , the central bead diffusion , and the linear relaxation modulus . </S>",
