    "the discovery of various fluctuation theorems @xcite made about 20 years ago has led to quite some theoretical and experimental activity with applications and generalizations in sundry directions both within classical and quantum physics @xcite .",
    "in contrast to fluctuation dissipation theorems @xcite which quantify the response of the average behavior of an arbitrary system variable on a small perturbation leaving the system close to equilibrium , fluctuation theorems are based on the full statistics of work performed by perturbations that may drive the considered system far away from its initial thermal equilibrium state .    to the best of our knowledge , an important aspect has not yet been considered : so far , the parameters characterizing the initial and the final hamiltonians , as well as the full sequence of hamiltonians that connects them and usually is referred to as the `` force protocol '' , have always been assumed as being precisely tuned in an experiment and therefore also considered as exactly known in theoretical studies without allowing for any deviations . in the present work we restrict ourselves to sudden quenches of a system described by an instantaneous change of the hamiltonian . in this case",

    "<S> the statistics of work performed on a system by a sudden random quench is investigated . considering systems with finite dimensional hilbert spaces we model a sudden random quench by randomly choosing elements from a gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) consisting of hermitean matrices with identically , gaussian distributed matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> a probability density function ( pdf ) of work in terms of initial and final energy distributions is derived and evaluated for a two - level system . </S>",
    "<S> explicit results are obtained for quenches with a sharply given initial hamiltonian , while the work pdfs for quenches between hamiltonians from two independent gues can only be determined in explicit form in the limits of zero and infinite temperature . </S>"
