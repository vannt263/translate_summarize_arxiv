    "in recent years , our ability to calculate strongly correlated materials has substantially improved . to this end",
    ", one needs to go beyond the conventional local density approximation ( lda).@xcite new methods had to be developed like lda+@xmath0,@xcite where lda is supplemented by a local coulomb interaction @xmath0 treated in the static hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field theory , and its sibling lda+dmft,@xcite which employs the more sophisticated dynamical mean field theory ( dmft).@xcite while it is generally accepted that lda+dmft deals more accurately with strongly correlated metals , the simpler lda+u is considered to be sufficient for insulators with a large @xmath0,@xcite at least in the presence of magnetic or orbital ordering .",
    "indeed , lda+u was tailored for such strongly correlated insulators,@xcite and is nowadays widely employed to calculate various physical quantities of these .    in our paper",
    ", we work out the differences between a static and a dynamical mean field treatment of long - range - ordered insulators at intermediate to strong coulomb interactions @xmath0 . for realistic material calculations",
    ", this would correspond to lda+u and lda+dmft .",
    "we study these differences , considering the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase of a simple model , the one - band hubbard model .",
    "we point out that at large @xmath0 dynamic properties and the structure of excited states are strikingly different in the slater ( hf ) and the dmft antiferromagnet .",
    "more specifically the slater bands are strongly renormalized , most of the spectral weight is transferred to spin - polaron side bands , and the overall bandwidth is proportional to the non - interacting width @xmath3 , as opposed to the @xmath4 shrinking found in hf .",
    "we also performed photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) experiments for v@xmath1o@xmath2 doped with 1.2% cr , considering both the af and the paramagnetic insulator .",
    "these experiments confirm that strongly correlated antiferromagnets are not of slater ( hf ) type , while they can in many respects be described by dmft .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ due ] the dmft results for the antiferromagnetic phase of the hubbard model are presented and compared to the exact solution of the @xmath5-@xmath6 model in infinite dimensions . in sec .",
    "[ tre ] we analyze the evolution of staggered magnetization and spectral function from weak to strong coupling .",
    "this allows us to draw some general conclusions about the validity of dmft and hf in describing both ground- and excited - state properties in the antiferromagnetic phase . in sec .",
    "[ quattro ] the evolution from a mott antiferromagnet to a paramagnetic mott insulator with increasing temperature is discussed .",
    "the photoemission spectrum of v@xmath1o@xmath2 is also presented in both phases and it is compared to our theoretical calculation .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ cinque ] .",
    "several studies have been performed on the af phase of the hubbard model,@xcite but here we focus on large values of @xmath0 , that received less attention in the past , and we exploit some technical advances to improve the accuracy of our dmft calculation so that we can make definite statements not only about the size of the af gap but also regarding the inner structure of the ( hubbard or slater ) bands below ( and above ) the gap . in the large @xmath0 limit , we can make contact with the @xmath5-@xmath6 model which has been studied in infinite dimensions by strack and vollhardt.@xcite we recover the spin - polaron peaks of ref . which are however dispersive in our calculation , an effect occurring in order @xmath7 and hence absent in ref . .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian reads @xmath8 where @xmath5 is the hopping amplitude , @xmath0 is the coulomb repulsion , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are annihilation ( creation ) operators for spin @xmath11 electrons on site @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we solve the dmft equations for a semicircular density of states @xmath14 with bandwidth @xmath15 , using exact diagonalization and lanczos algorithm at @xmath16 for the associated anderson impurity model ( aim ) .",
    "a continued fraction expansion of the dmft weiss fields @xcite allows us to obtain reliable spectra in the intermediate - to - large @xmath0 region .",
    "moreover , in the af phase we are able push the number of aim sites @xmath17 to much larger values than for the paramagnetic phase .     and @xmath18 .",
    "green ( light gray ) : @xmath5-@xmath6 model for @xmath19 .",
    "both spectra have been plotted using the same lorentzian broadening.,width=321 ]    to confirm that we get reliable spectral functions we first consider the large-@xmath0 limit of the hubbard model and compare it to the exact solution for the @xmath5-@xmath6 model in infinite dimensions.@xcite the comparison of the @xmath20-integrated spectral functions is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in both cases",
    ", we show only the negative frequency part of the spectrum , i.e. , the lower hubbard band centered around @xmath21 ( the @xmath22 axis is shifted correspondingly ) .",
    "evidently in both cases we find spectra of the same type .",
    "we have also verified that the dmft spectra are almost independent on @xmath17 , reflecting the fact that , contrary to the case of the paramagnetic insulating phase , in the af phase the peaks do not originate from the discreteness of the impurity model but have a physical meaning.@xcite    as already observed in ref .",
    "they originate from the fact that a hole moving in the ordered background breaks af bonds costing an energy proportional to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the length of path in the lattice .",
    "this string potential gives rise to a set of discrete energy levels with a typical separation proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "these levels can be interpreted as spin - polaron side peaks@xcite for dispersionless spin - waves.@xcite in the @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) limit , these spin - polaron peaks become dense and the lower hubbard band recovers the shape and the width of the non - interacting density of states , with the important difference that the states are incoherent for @xmath26 . in our finite-@xmath0 case , we find that the shift of the peaks in the hubbard model with respect to the @xmath5-@xmath6 model scales with @xmath28 .",
    "that means we recover the infinite-@xmath0 limit where the mapping of the hubbard to the @xmath5-@xmath6 model is exact .",
    "after having demonstrated the accuracy of our spectra we investigate how the picture changes when @xmath0 is lower and follow the evolution of our antiferromagnetic solution as a function of @xmath0 .    while , for @xmath29 static and dynamical mean - field theories yield , as one expects , similar spectra ( see uppermost curve in the main panel of fig . [ fig2 ] ) , already for @xmath30 the spin - polaron picture characteristic of the @xmath5-@xmath6 model is almost fully developed .",
    "this is instead completely missed by the static mean - field theory .",
    "the discrepancy between dmft and hf spectrum grows with increasing @xmath0 , as exemplified in the figure for @xmath31 .",
    "the hf spectrum arises from a renormalized single - particle band with a dispersion decreasing as @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast in dmft the width of the hubbard band is always of the order of the bare bandwidth even in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "focusing on the rightmost peak of the hubbard band , we find that it continuously evolves from the weak - coupling slater ( hf ) peak .",
    "however , its spectral weight @xmath33 , directly measured from the spectral density , is dramatically reduced when increasing @xmath0 since more and more weight is transferred to the spin - polaron side bands . as it can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath33 scales as @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "this is what is also found for the @xmath5-@xmath6 model , however the physical nature of the excitation is different .    .",
    "the solid gray lines represent the hf spectrum for @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in the inset",
    "the spectral weight and the quasiparticle dispersion are shown as a function of @xmath38,width=321 ]    in the @xmath5-@xmath6 model the peaks are dispersionless,@xcite while in the hubbard model we find , for the peak closest to the fermi level , a bandwidth @xmath39 which scales as @xmath40 for large @xmath0 ( solid diamonds in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    an independent argument for the dispersion of this peak",
    "is obtained by explicitly looking for the poles of the green s function.@xcite averaging over the two sublattices we obtain @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bare band energy , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 is a sublattice index . the renormalized dispersion @xmath46 is given by the solutions of @xmath47 with @xmath42 ranging from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "we label @xmath50 the solution for @xmath51 . at large @xmath0",
    "we expand eq .",
    "( [ poles ] ) to linear order and obtain @xmath52 where we have defined @xmath53 to determine the value of @xmath54 , we consider the green s function for energies @xmath55 , which for large @xmath0 is given by the green s function of a given sublattice , e.g. @xmath56 . in this limit , @xmath57 .",
    "then we find that the quasiparticle weight is given by @xmath58 .    in particular ,",
    "considering as an example the case of a hypercubic lattice , the dispersion @xmath46 has the following form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the wave vector in the @xmath24th dimension .",
    "the presence of a finite quasiparticle dispersion in the hubbard model can be understood as an effect of the @xmath61 terms neglected in the mapping to the @xmath5-@xmath6 hamiltonian.@xcite more precisely , in addition to the standard @xmath5-@xmath6 terms , the large-@xmath0 projection of the hubbard model leads to spin - flip terms and to second ( @xmath62 ) and third ( @xmath63 ) nearest neighbor hopping integrals .",
    "such high - order hoppings contribute to the quasiparticle dispersion even in infinite dimensions , and in the specific case of a hole in a nel state read @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . for a hypercubic lattice these terms give rise to a bare dispersion of the form @xmath66 from the results obtained in ref . for a @xmath5-@xmath67-@xmath6 model",
    ", we expect for the hubbard model , in the limit of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , a dispersion given by the bare @xmath70 of eq .",
    "( [ epskt2t3 ] ) renormalized by the quasiparticle weight @xmath71 .",
    "this expectation is in fact confirmed since @xmath72 coincides with the dispersion given by eq .",
    "( [ epskdmft2 ] ) .",
    "these considerations support the interpretation of our dmft results as a quasiparticle renormalization of the slater ( hf ) peak ; the width of this peak shrinks like @xmath73 and it is further reduced by @xmath71 so that altogether @xmath74 .    , where @xmath75 is the staggered magnetization . in the hartree - fock case",
    "the gap coincides with @xmath76 ( dashed line ) . in the inset",
    "we compare the dmft and the hf magnetization as a function of @xmath0.,width=321 ]    as already mentioned before , a striking difference between the slater and the dmft spectrum is the amplitude of the spectral gap .",
    "since the hf slater peak is located roughly at the center of the dmft lower hubbard band of width of order @xmath3 , for large @xmath0 the spectral gap is reduced from the hf value @xmath0 to @xmath77 .",
    "we illustrate this aspect in fig .",
    "[ newfig ] , where the amplitude of the spectral gap is plotted as a function of the order parameter @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath76 is given by @xmath0 multiplied by the staggered magnetization @xmath75 , whose behavior is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ newfig ] .",
    "the dmft results indicate that , on the one hand the staggered magnetization gets closer and closer to the hartree - fock value by increasing @xmath0 , while , on the other hand , the spectral gap deviates more and more from the hartree - fock prediction ( @xmath76 ) approaching the asymptotic value of @xmath78 .",
    "thus we have the interesting situation where the two methods give essentially the same magnetization , while there is a sizeable difference in the gaps .",
    "our findings highlight one important point : at large @xmath0 , dmft and hf give the same description of the antiferromagnetic ground - state , which is basically the nel state . on the other hand ,",
    "the description of excited states is strikingly different between dmft and hf . in hf",
    "the hole moves in a `` rigid '' background of nel spins , while , in dmft , due to quantum fluctuations , the excitations are of a completely different nature : the hole can also move around without paying the double occupancy cost , with a creation of a spin polaron . therefore , even if all ground - state quantities ( @xmath75 , kinetic and potential energy ,  ) are basically the same in the two descriptions , excited state properties ( hence spectra ) are completely misrepresented by hf .",
    "this also means that , within hf , it is not possible to simultaneously obtain the correct magnetization and spectral gap with the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "this has obvious implications for the use of lda+u for antiferromagnets ( or similarly for orbitally - ordered phases ) with a large gap .",
    "our dmft calculations can be extended also to finite temperature . in this case , calculations can only be performed with a lower value of @xmath17 , but their precision is still sufficient to address a crucial issue of the mott antiferromagnet , namely the evolution from a @xmath5-@xmath6 antiferromagnet to a paramagnetic mott insulator above the nel temperature . in particular we are interested in the mechanism ruling the evolution of the system from a fully polarized antiferromagnet with a spectral gap of order @xmath0 to a mott insulator with zero magnetization but with a gap of the same order of magnitude . at low @xmath79 , due to the onset of long - range af order ,",
    "the opening of the gap is accompanied by a rigid shift in the real parts of the self - energy , whose value is given by the magnitude of the order parameter .",
    "the imaginary parts are , in this case , small for both spin species and non - zero only where the corresponding ( up or down ) spectral weight is present ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . on the other hand , for @xmath80 ,",
    "when the order parameter is zero , a mott gap of order @xmath0 is found , associated with a @xmath81 peak in the imaginary parts of @xmath82 at zero frequency , as can be seen in the lowest panel of fig .",
    "how can we go from one situation to the other ? by increasing @xmath79 , two peaks in the imaginary parts of @xmath82 develop inside the spectral gap ( indicated by the vertical dashed lines in the figure ) and their mutual distance decreases together with the order parameter @xmath76 : the two peaks can be viewed as precursor of the @xmath81 behavior in the paramagnetic mott insulator .    , below ( two upper panels ) and above ( lowest panel ) the nel temperature ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the spectral gap is marked by the dashed vertical lines and @xmath84.,width=321 ]    let us now ask : are real transition metal oxides described by static or dynamical mean field theory ? to this end , we performed photoemission measurements for v@xmath1o@xmath2 doped with 1.2% cr .",
    "@xcite the measurement was made at beamline bl25su of spring-8 using 500ev photons .",
    "the experimental details are exactly as described previously.@xcite the comparison between theory and experiments is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , taking parameters reasonable for v@xmath1o@xmath2 : @xmath85[ev ] and @xmath86[ev ] .",
    "as we discuss below , the theoretical spectra have been broadened to make contact with the experiment .",
    "both theoretical and experimental spectra are normalized to have the same area . a shirley - type inelastic background has been removed from the experimental data .    comparing the experimental data ( right panel of fig.([fig4 ] ) ) to the spectra we have discussed until now , it is evident that the spiky nature of the latter is absent , or at least basically invisible , in the former .",
    "this is evidently due to at least three sources of broadening : the intrinsic experimental broadening , the finite temperature and finite dimensionality effects beyond the dmft .",
    "this last source of broadening can , e.g. , arise from the coupling to _ dispersive _ spin - waves.@xcite the size of this effect is hard to estimate for three - dimensional compounds . however , to mimic the overall effect we have plotted in the left panel of fig.([fig4 ] ) our theoretical results using a broadening of @xmath87[ev ] , larger than the experimental one ( @xmath88[ev ] ) in order to include phenomenologically the other effects .",
    "a first observation is that the experimental spectrum in the antiferromagnetic phase has an overall width of the same order of the paramagnet .",
    "we have already shown how this is realized in the dmft spectra , in contrast to the static hf mean - field .",
    "theory and experiment qualitatively agree also on the substantial redistribution of spectral weight : going from the paramagnetic to the af insulator , an additional peak develops at the upper edge of the lower hubbard band .",
    "this peak is the one we identified as a ( quasiparticle- ) renormalized slater band . besides this peak",
    "there is additional spectral weight coming from the broadened spin polaron side - bands .",
    "remarkably , the gap is found to increase when going from the paramagnetic to the af insulator both in experimental and theoretical spectra .",
    "it is worth remarking that this feature does not depend on a particular choice of the value of @xmath0 , since it occurs even in the infinite-@xmath0 case.@xcite the agreement is less good in one qualitative aspect : the flank at the lower edge of the hubbard band is almost identical for both phases in experiment whereas they slightly differ in the theoretical calculation .",
    "this is likely due to the lack of some realistic features , like an asymmetric density of states and multi - orbital effects in our model calculations .",
    "this point could be clarified by extending lda+dmft calculations from the paramagnetic phase @xcite to af v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "in this work we have compared static and dynamical mean field descriptions of the antiferromagnetic phase of the hubbard model .",
    "we have analyzed the evolution from weak to strong coupling of both ground - state ( e.g. magnetization ) and excited - states ( e.g. spectra ) properties .",
    "contrary to the general expectation that hf gives a good description of broken - symmetry phases both at weak and strong coupling , we have found that , at large @xmath0 , this is true only for ground - state quantities . the poor description of the excitations given by static - mean field reflects in a hf spectrum given only by two unrenormalized ( @xmath89 ) slater bands which shrink as @xmath4 with increasing @xmath0 . on the contrary ,",
    "when the excited states are better described , as in dmft , the slater bands get strongly renormalized ( @xmath90 ) and most of the spectral weight is transferred to spin polaron side bands",
    ". therefore the total width of the hubbard band stays finite ( of order @xmath3 ) even for large @xmath0 and the spectral gap is not given by @xmath0 , as in hf , rather by @xmath77 .",
    "we have also performed pes experiments on cr - doped v@xmath1o@xmath2 both in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phase .",
    "we have found a qualitative agreement with the dmft calculations , in the formation of the renormalized slater peak , in the overall width of the band ( of order @xmath3 rather than @xmath34 ) , and also in the shrinking of the gap when going from the paramagnetic to the antiferromagnetic phase .    in conclusion , we demonstrated with our dmft calculation and by comparing theory with experiments that one has to be careful when applying static mean field theories , like lda+@xmath0 , for calculating physical properties of insulators with long range order .",
    "adjusting @xmath0 to get the correct gap , one obtains wrong estimates of the magnetization , or the energy , and _",
    "vice versa_. these problems can be overcome by employing dynamical mean field theory .",
