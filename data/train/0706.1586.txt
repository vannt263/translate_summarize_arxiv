    "note that this section of virgohi 21 is unresolved in individual channels , leading to a broadening of the linewidths down each line of sight to @xmath27 kms@xmath1 and a lowering of the column - density as the hi is smeared by the beam .",
    "to place a better limit on the presence of stars associated with virgohi 21 we have obtained hst data with a total exposure time of 23142 s. the acs wide field camera was used with the @xmath4-band f814w filter .",

    "artificial star tests were used to determine the completeness of our selection ; the 50% completeness limit is found to be @xmath31 mag .",
    "we found that the photometry catalog produced with daophot / allstar ( @xmath11600 objects ) included bad measurements due to misidentifications such as parts of bright background galaxies or unresolved background galaxies whose contribution to the luminosity function is significant at fainter magnitudes ( see durrell et al .",
    "2002 ) . given the long exposures required by such observations we did not ask for additional time to look at another field to determine the background density of star - like objects ; instead , we have removed objects from our list by individually examining their radial profiles and rejecting those with a fwhm @xmath32 2.5 - 3 pixels , corresponding to the value of the psf built with the brightest stars in the field .",
    "the final list consists of 281 stars and the corresponding luminosity function is shown in fig .",
    "[ lum_func ] .    to estimate the contamination due to foreground stars , we compared the number of detections with a model of the expected number of milky way stars in the position of the virgo cluster ( castellani et al .",
    "2002 ; cignoni et al .",
    "this model shows that the contribution of foreground stars is only significant at brighter magnitudes ( @xmath33 ) where the number of stars detected is small ( fig .",
    "[ lum_func ] ) ; at fainter magnitudes the larger number of detections makes the foreground unimportant .    to search for the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) we have applied a sobel filter to the binned luminosity functions .",
    "the luminosity function shows a slope change at @xmath34 mag , which we identify as the possible tip of the red giant branch .",
    "this would place these stars at a distance of 16.6 - 18.2 mpc , which is consistent with them being in the virgo cluster ( d=16 mpc ) , though the statistics are poor due to the relatively low numbers of stars in each magnitude bin .",
    "if we assume this trgb to be real , despite the low signal to noise ratio ( around 2@xmath35 on the sobel - filter output ) , we can set the most stringent limit on the surface - brightness of virgohi 21 .    assuming ( very generously ) that all of the fainter stars are also at the distance of the cluster ( 119 with @xmath36 ) they have a combined magnitude of @xmath37 , giving a surface brightness of 33.8 @xmath4 mag arcsec@xmath6 . using the formula of durrell et al .",
    "( 2002 ) gives a correction for only having the top 0.7 mags of the rgb of @xmath38 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "we do not detect any asymptotic giant branch stars ; based on the work of durrell et al .",
    "these could contribute another @xmath39 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "overall , this gives an upper limit for the total @xmath4-band surface brightness of @xmath40 0.2 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "for normal galaxy colors of @xmath41 , this equates to an extremely faint @xmath16-band surface brightness of 32.4  33.3 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "these results can be compared with studies of virgo cluster inter - galactic stars ( durrell et al . 2002 ) and those used to determine the color - magnitude diagrams of dwarf galaxies belonging to the cluster ( caldwell 2006 ) .",

    "imaged a field at about 40@xmath42 northwest of m 87 ( @xmath43190 kpc ) while the two fields observed by caldwell were also relatively close to the center of virgo , one at @xmath44 north ( @xmath43400 kpc ) and the other at @xmath45 west ( @xmath43315 kpc ) .",
    "these fields are much closer to m 87 at the center of the cluster than virgohi 21 and the number density of stars found is also much higher however , there is an apparent decrease in the number of stars as one moves away from the cluster center ( see fig . 9 in caldwell 2006 and",
    "6 in durrell et al .",
    "a comparison between the estimated surface brightnesses of the three fields shows that @xmath46 ranges from 27.7 @xmath4 mag arcsec@xmath6 ( durrell et al .",
    "2002 ) for the fields closer to the cluster center to @xmath47 27.9 and 29.9 @xmath4 mag arcsec@xmath6 ( caldwell 2006 ) for the more distant ones .",
    "our @xmath4 band surface brightness of 31.3 , at a projected distance of 1.1 mpc from the cluster center ( m87 ) , is thus consistent with the known population intra - cluster stars in virgo and so there is no evidence to suggest that our detections are associated with virgohi 21 in any way .",
    "in the previous sections we have described our new observations of virgohi 21 . in this section",
    "we try and put them in context and particularly we want to assess the evidence for and against the dark galaxy hypothesis .    1 .",
    "if attributed to gravitation , changes in velocity of galactic size over galactic scales , as seen here , require masses of galactic proportions . on dimensional grounds the abrupt change in velocity @xmath48 ( @xmath0 kms@xmath1 ) seen in virgohi 21 over a conservative length - scale @xmath49 ( @xmath50 kpc @xmath51 cm @xmath52 arcmin at the virgo cluster distance of 16 mpc ) implies a mass @xmath53 solar masses if this is due to an object rotating in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "if the velocities are not due to rotation then changes in velocity like this can be observed if , for example , we are observing an arc of gas and our view is almost edge - on .",
    "these geometrical effects can lead to large velocity widths that may resemble rotation ( e.g. bournaud et al .",
    "2004 ) . the problem with this latter scenario ( as also pointed out by vollmer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is that the perturbing galaxy should be moving in the plane of the arc and so should be projected on the sky very close to it .",
    "we can simply quantify what we mean by this .",
    "imagine two galaxies with radial velocities , @xmath54 and @xmath55 at either end of an approximately linear tidal bridge of physical length @xmath56 pitched at an angle @xmath57 to the line of sight .",
    "a telescope pointed towards it has a transverse beam diameter of @xmath58 at the bridge .",
    "the only significant gas motions within the bridge will be streaming velocities along its length . from end to end of the bridge the radial velocity difference is @xmath59 while within the telescope beam the measured velocity width , @xmath48 , will be ( @xmath60 .",
    "but , bridges of any appreciable size arise only when the total velocity difference between the interacting galaxies i.e. @xmath61 , is of order the circular velocity @xmath62 in the galaxies involved ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath63 .",
    "thus broad line widths @xmath64 , as here , can only be seen within a beam if both interactors appear to lie within , or very close to the beam i.e. @xmath65 .",
    "we can find no potential perturber within the arecibo beam ( @xmath66 ) or close to it .",
    "thus we do not believe virgohi 21 can be tidal debris from an interaction of this nature .",
    "the existence of the hi bridge indicates that ngc 4254 has undergone some kind of interaction .",
    "ngc 4254 is a luminous one - armed spiral galaxy sufficiently peculiar to have attracted several studies ( iye et al .",
    "1982 ; phookun et al .",
    "1993 ; vollmer et al .",
    "according to vollmer et al .",
    "2005 ) the morphological peculiarities of ngc 4254 can be explained by an interaction with a perturbing mass of @xmath67 .",
    "as it is now clear that virgohi 21 is involved in this interaction , it should be considered a candidate for the perturber , particularly as no other candidate can be easily identified .",
    "the vollmer et al .",
    "simulation implies an interaction @xmath68 years ago .",
    "as the projected length of the bridge is 120 kpc this would imply it has been drawn out at a projected speed of 390 kms@xmath1 , which is comparable to the radial velocity difference between ngc 4254 and virgohi 21 of 400 kms@xmath1 .",
    "thus if virgohi 21 were massive enough ( @xmath3 @xmath69 ) , it could be the cause of the tidal bridge .",
    "if object c , the hi galaxy just to the east ( left ) of virgohi 21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) were involved its mass ( see ( a ) above ) should be @xmath70 . however , its measured hi velocity distribution and size suggest a probable mass @xmath71 , while it has a luminosity of only @xmath72 and a @xmath73 of @xmath74 . galaxy ` c ' appears to be two orders of magnitude too undermassive and underluminous to explain the one - armed spiral structure of ngc 4254 and the hi bridge connecting to it .",
    "so , it seems very unlikely that ` c ' has sufficient mass to cause a perturbation of over 200 kms@xmath1 to the tidal stream , and virgohi 21 passes to its west , not between it and ngc 4262 as might be expected if it had pulled the stream westward .",
    "the radial velocity of ` c ' means that it must be moving past the stream at a velocity ( relative to the putative undisturbed velocity of the stream ) of at least 350 kms@xmath1 . at this speed",
    ", it would not have stayed close to the stream long enough to have severely disturbed it .",
    "it would also be expected that if ` c ' were involved in the interaction then there would be gas falling onto it , but this does not appear to be the case as there is no gas seen between virgohi 21 and c. the hi in ` c ' is unresolved , implying that it is confined to the area of the optical galaxy ; it shows no signs of infalling gas streams or any other disturbance .",
    "galaxy ` c ' is in our a minds a possible , but highly unlikely participant in this interaction .",
    "4 .   recently bekki et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have published numerical simulations on the basis of which they argue that `` virgohi 21   is likely to be tidal debris rather than a ` dark galaxy ' '' .",
    "they model high - speed , hyperbolic interactions within cluster potentials ( at 350 and 700 kpc from the cluster center ) over 2 gyr in order to draw out very long tidal tails where the hi and stars have become separated so that the average surface brightness within a 100 kpc@xmath75 box is @xmath76 mag arcsec@xmath6 ( @xmath77 ) , assuming @xmath78 .",
    "the bekki et al .",
    "stellar density can be converted to @xmath4-band if we assume a value for @xmath79 .",
    "estimates of this vary ( e.g. portinari et al . 2004 ; vallejo et al .",
    "2002 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1997 ) but are generally close to 1 and always less than 2 . we therefore adopt a very conservative ( in the sense of producing the lowest @xmath4-band surface - brightness ) value of @xmath80 .",
    "this gives a value of @xmath81 for the surface - brightness estimates given in bekki et al .",
    "for the two double - tailed models presented ( m1 and m2 ) this gives average @xmath4-band surface - brightnesses of 32.7 and 33.0 mag arcsec@xmath6 , while for the two single - tailed models presented ( m3 and m4 ) this gives average @xmath4-band surface - brightnesses of 29.5 and 29.9 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "the two - tailed models are inconsistent with our hi data and the hi data of phookun et al . , which clearly show a single tail from ngc 4254 , while the single - tailed models give considerably higher surface - brightnesses ( 1.2  1.6 mags , or 6  8 @xmath35 ) than the upper limit from our hst observations .",
    "in addition to this , bekki et al . find that the velocity fields produced in the dark clouds by their models do not resemble rotation , concluding that `` velocity fields are the key observational tools to help us determine whether gas clouds are ( unbound ) tidal debris or are self - gravitating systems embedded within a massive dark matter halo . '' from both the surface - density of stars expected in a single - tail interaction and from the rotation curve , it appears that high - speed , hyperbolic interactions within a cluster potential like those proposed by bekki et al .",
    "are unable to reproduce our new observations of virgohi 21 .",
    "ngc 4262 , the spiral to the north - east , does not appear to be involved .",
    "this is not surprising because it is in totally the wrong place to give rise to a tidal feature like that observed ( ngc 4262 , ngc 4254 and virgohi 21 form a well separted triangle on the sky , see also vollmer et al .",
    "also , the radial velocity between ngc 4254 and ngc 4262 is far too large ( 900 kms@xmath1 ) to generate tidal features such as bridges and tails .",
    "furthermore , with such a large radial velocity difference between ngc 4254 and ngc 4262 , any interaction must be at high speed and , as seen above from the simulations of bekki et al .",
    ", such interactions are not capable of reproducing our observations as even the most isolated gas clouds formed in single - tail systems have surface - brightnesses 1.5 - 2 magnitudes brighter than the limit set by our hst observations .",
    "ngc 4262 is a s0 galaxy with an hi ring that is inclined with respect to the optical disk ( krumm et al .",
    "krumm et al . present higher - resolution hi observations than our data and they say that if the hi has come from an interaction , `` the narrowness of the ring and the undisturbed appearance of the optical disk suggest that the donor was a gas - rich dwarf galaxy or intergalactic hi cloud , rather than a massive spiral ''",
    ". thus we find it very difficult to see how ngc 4262 can have given rise to the features we have now observed .",
    "the components of virgohi 21 are connected both spatially and in velocity , making it exceedingly improbable that they could be chance superpositions of smaller hydrogen clouds , while the bridge to ngc 4254 is not explained by this hypothesis .",
    "phookun et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggested that the distortion of ngc 4254 could be due to infalling gas - clouds .",
    "could virgohi 21 be a tail , similar to those seen in ( briggs et al .",
    "2001 ) or ( gordon et al .",
    "in ngc 4038/9 , in particular , there is what appears to be a tidal dwarf near a strong concentration of hi at the end of the southern tail , around 60 kpc from the center of the system ( for a distance of 13.8 mpc ; saviane et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , the major problem with this hypothesis is that ngc 4254 apparently shows no sign of having undergone a recent merger .",
    "it would be expected that a merger violent enough to have thrown out an arm over 100 kpc in length would leave some imprint on the optical disk , but this is not the case here .",
    "phookun et al .",
    "found that `` the galaxy is undergoing an interaction that is not so strong or violent as to disrupt the disk . ''",
    "while this fits with the hypothesis of virgohi 21 as a dark galaxy , playing a role similar to that of the companions of or in exciting the @xmath82 mode , it does not fit the merger scenario .",
    "oosterloo & van gorkom ( 2005 ) argue that another hi cloud in the virgo cluster , ( davies et al .",
    "2004 ) , is caused by ram - pressure stripping from due to an interaction with the hot - gas halo of the sub - group and suggest a similar origin could be possible for virgohi 21 .",
    "this would explain the bridge without the need to invoke a second galaxy , either interacting or merging .",
    "however , we can not see how this can give the steep , reversed velocity gradient seen in virgohi 21 , nor does it explain the distortion to the optical disk of ngc 4254 .",
    "single - armed spirals are normally the result of interactions with close - by massive companions ( iye et al . 1982 ; phookun et al .",
    "1993 ) ; the lack of any visible companion to ngc 4254 has thus led to a number of observations and dynamical models . as mentioned above , recent numerical models by vollmer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that ngc 4254 `` had a close and rapid encounter with a @xmath83 galaxy @xmath84 myr ago .",

    "this supports our inference that virgohi 21 is the aforesaid @xmath67 mass which caused the peculiarities in ngc 4254 - particularly so given the lack of any other candidate .    if our hypothesis is correct that this is a dark , gravitationally bound , edge - on rotating disk then its properties are as presented in table [ properties ] . judging from visible disk galaxies ,",
    "whose masses continue to rise beyond their hi edges ( e.g. salucci & persic 1997 ) , the full size and mass of such a disk could easily reach the @xmath67 required by the vollmer et al .",

    "virgohi 21 itself was missed in the normal hipass - sensitivity observations of this area , and only picked up with ten times longer integrations in the virgohi survey . in any case single - dish angular resolution",
    "makes it all too easy to confuse a dark cloud with a bright object clustered with it ( davies et al .",
    "the recent optical identification program for hipass sources ( doyle et al .",
    "2005 ) can rule out only ` isolated ' , i.e. unclustered , dark galaxies .    if we accept the total mass given in table 1 then an oddity about virgohi 21 is its shortage of baryons compared to visible galaxies .",
    "visible disk galaxies typically have , in the form of stars and gas , @xmath111 percent of their dynamical mass in baryons , a figure consistent with cosmological models which predict @xmath112 times as much dark matter as baryonic in the universe at large ( salucci & persic 1997 ) . had virgohi 21 ten percent of its mass in baryons it would contain @xmath113 solar masses which would , if it were once in the form of hi spread evenly across the existing dynamical disk , yield a column density @xmath114 atoms cm@xmath6  sufficiently above the `` star - formation threshold '' of @xmath115 cm@xmath6 ( martin & kennicutt 2001 ) , or above the toomre criterion for gravitational instability in a rotating disk ( toomre 1964 ) , to form stars ( jimenez et al .",

    "in this paper we have presented new westerbork high resolution 21-cm observations of a hi source ( virgohi 21 ) that we have previously observed at jodrell bank and arecibo .",
    "these observations clearly show that virgohi 21 has played a part in some form of interaction with the bright spiral galaxy ngc 4254 . whether virgohi 21 is the result of some previous interaction with a third object or it is the interacting object itself is still open to conjecture .",
    "we have argued in this paper that the weight of evidence now resides on the side of the latter rather than the former conjecture .",
    "this is primarily because the new observations show a long drawn out tidal feature which has an abrupt velocity change and we can not find a candidate galaxy to have caused it .",
    "tidal interactions between optically bright galaxies often draw out stars as well as gas .",
    "we have also used hst to search for stars associated with virgohi 21 and find none down to very faint surface brightness levels .",
