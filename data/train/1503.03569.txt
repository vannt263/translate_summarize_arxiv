    "intensity modulated radiation therapy ( imrt ) is usually used for head and neck cancer patients because it delivers highly conformal radiation doses to the target with reduction of toxicity to normal organs , as compared with conventional radiation therapy techniques @xcite .",
    "volumetric modulated arc therapy ( vmat ) is a novel imrt technique .",
    "vmat has less mu , less treatment time , high quality planning and more efficiency than static gantry angle imrt @xcite . during vmat the linear accelerator ( linac ) control system changes the dose rate and the multi leaf collimator ( mlc ) positions while gantry is rotating around the patient .",
    "collimator angle is usually rotated in the plans of vmat to reduce radiation leakage between mlc leaves .",
    "at a zero angle , the leakage between mlc leaves accumulates during the gantry rotation and the summed leakage results in unwanted dose distributions , which can not be controlled by optimization . at different collimator angles ,",
    "the unwanted doses can be controlled by dose constraints in the optimization procedure so that we can reduce the unwanted doses . the optimal collimator angle for vmat plan",
    "is thus required to be determined .",
    "there are several factors for consideration in the choice of the collimator angle of the vmat plan . among them",
    "we concentrated on the accuracy of the vmat delivery .",
    "we studied the effect of the collimator angle on the results of dosimetric verifications of the vmat plan for nasopharyngeal cancer ( npc ) .",
    "ten patients with late - stage nasopharyngeal cancer were treated with concurrent chemo radiation therapy ( ccrt ) .",
    "eight patients had stage iii disease and 2 patients had stage iv disease according to american joint committee on cancer staging system 7 .",
    "nine patients were male and 1 patient was female .",
    "one radiation oncologist delineated radiation targets and organs at risk ( oars ) .",
    "the clinical target volume ( ctv ) included the primary nasopharyngeal tumor , neck nodal region and subclinical disease . considering the setup uncertainty ,",
    "margins ranging from 3 - 10 mm were added to each ctv to create a planning target volume ( ptv ) .",
    "reduced - field techniques were used for delivery of the 66 - 70 gy total dose .",
    "the treatment plan course for each patient consisted of several sub - plans . in this study , we selected the first plan with prescribed doses of 50 - 60 gy in 25 - 30 fractions to study the effect of the collimator angles on dosimetric verifications of the vmat .",
    "the radiation treatment planning system eclipse v10.0.42 ( varian medical systems , usa ) was used to generate vmat plans .",
    "the vmat ( rapidarc : varian ) plans were generated for clinac ix linear accelerator using 6 mv photons .",
    "the clinac ix is equipped with a millennium 120 mlc that has spatial resolution of 5 mm at the isocenter for the central 20 cm region and of 10 mm in the outer 2@xmath110 cm region .",
    "the maximum mlc leaf speed is 2.5 cm / s and leaf transmission is 1.8% .",
    "dosimetric leaf gap of the mlc was measured using the procedure recommended by varian medical systems .",
    "the value of the dosimetric leaf gap was 1.427 mm for 6 mv photons .",
    "for volume dose calculation , grid size of 2.5 mm , inhomogeneiy correction , the anisotropic analytical algorithm ( aaa ) v10.0.28 and the progressive resolution optimizer ( pro ) v10.0.28 were used in all plans .",
    "vmat plans for npc patients were composed of 2 coplanar full arcs in 181 - 179 degree clockwise and 179 - 181 degree counterclockwise directions .",
    "the 2 full - arc delivery was expected to achieve better target coverage and conformity than the single arc @xcite .",
    "we generated 10 vmat plans ( plan set a ) with different collimator angles for each patient .",
    "ten collimator angles for the first arc were 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , 40 and 45 degrees . for the second arc",
    ", the collimator angle was selected explementary to the collimator angle of the first arc in the same plan , i.e. , the 2 collimator angles added up to 360 degree .",
    "the average field size of vmat plans was 22 @xmath1 22 @xmath2 .",
    "we used the same dose constraints for all the 10 vmat plans and optimization was conducted for each plan .",
    "the maximum dose rate was 600 mu / min .",
    "the target coverage was aimed to achieve a 100% volume covered by 95% of prescribed dose .",
    "optimization of each plan resulted in different fluences and different mlc motions for each plan .",
    "therefore we had 2 variables , i.e. , the collimator angle and mlc motions . to simplify the analysis we generated another set of 10 plans ( plan set b ) with the same mlc motions and different collimator angles for each patient .",
    "the mlc motions were those of the plan with 30 degree collimator angle .",
    "the plans in this set had different dose distributions and usually can not be used for treatment purposes excepting the plan with a 30 degree collimator angle .",
    "we performed patient specific quality assurances ( qa ) of 2 sets of 10 vmat plans for each patient .",
    "the measurements were made by the 2-dimensional ion chamber array matrixx ( iba dosimetry , germany ) @xcite .",
    "the matrixx has 1020 pixel ion chambers arranged in a 32@xmath132 matrix covering 24.4@xmath124.4 @xmath2 .",
    "each ion chamber has the following dimensions : 4.5 mm in diameter , 5 mm in height and a sensitive volume of 0.08 @xmath3 .",
    "the distance between chambers is 7.619 mm .",
    "the matrixx has an intrinsic buildup and backscatter thicknesses of 0.3 mm and 3.5 mm , respectively .",
    "the matrixx was placed between solid water phantoms multicube ( iba dosimetry , germany ) ( figure [ fig1 ] ) so that thickness of total buildup and backscatter was 5 cm ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the source to surface distance was 95 cm with the measurement plane of the matrixx at the isocenter of the linac .",
    "measurement was done for each arc in the plan ; therefore , we conducted 40 measurements for each patient and the total number of measurements was 400 .",
    "the angular dependence of the matrixx was corrected after the measurements using the gantry angle sensor @xcite ( iba dosimetry , germany ) .",
    "the comparison between the calculations and the measurements were made by @xmath0-index ( 2%/2 mm , 3%/3 mm ) analysis @xcite using omnipro imrt v1.7b ( iba dosimetry , germany ) .",
    "the @xmath0-index was calculated only for the regions that have dose values above 10% @xcite in the measured area .",
    "average @xmath0-index passing rates of patient specific qas were given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the results were averaged over the 2 arcs and 10 patients . because the 2 arcs in each vmat plan rotated almost 360 degrees and",
    "the measurement set - up is mirror symmetric about the measurement plane ( @xmath4 plane in figure [ fig2 ] ) of the matrixx detector and a vertical plane passing through the isocenter ( @xmath5 plane in figure [ fig2 ] ) the arc with collimator angle @xmath6 is symmetric to the arc with collimator angle @xmath7 .",
    "therefore we regarded the collimator angle of the second arc , which was equal to 360 minus the collimator angle of the first arc , as the collimator angle of the first arc in the analysis .",

    "a smaller collimator angle is better , and for mlc leakage a larger collimator angle is better , we were thus required to make a compromise . based on this study , in our hospital",
    "the collimator angles of the vmat plans for head and neck patients range between 15 - 25 degrees because the average @xmath0-index passing rates were above or near to 90% for the 2%/2 mm criteria and 97% for the 3%/3 mm criteria , as shown in the results of the passing rates for the plan set a ( table [ table1 ] ) . in other hospitals these results can be somewhat different because they have different vmat delivery systems and diffterent vmat planning systems .",

    "it was reported that leaf limiting velocity , mlc position and mechanical isocenter varied at different collimator and gantry angles @xcite .",
