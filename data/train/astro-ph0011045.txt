    "the main objective of our observations was to obtain physical parameters for a selection of metal - rich globular clusters in m31 .",
    "these parameters are usually straight - forward to derive from color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , however , we have found the effects of crowding to be particularly severe .",
    "we therefore present our analysis in two parts .",
    "this paper describes in detail the effects of crowding , how we quantify them , the techniques used to correct for them , and their implications for future space - based observations such as with ngst . a second paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) presents the science obtained from our observations using these techniques .",
    "the general effects of crowding are well known , although not always accounted for .",
    "these effects include reduced photometric accuracy which broadens the cmd and smears the luminosity function ( lf ) , reduced positional accuracy @xcite , artificial brightening and shifts in the measured colors @xcite , and in severe cases , the creation of objects brighter than anything in the parent population through random groupings of many stars @xcite .",
    "if these effects are not taken into account , they can result in a mistaken spread in metallicity assumed from the rgb width , an incorrect mass function extrapolated from the lf , or a false age estimation from the agb peak luminosity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : observations ] presents the details of our observations , and section [ sec : data_reduction ] explains the reduction procedures .",
    "section [ sec : artificial_star_tests ] describes the different simulations in detail .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents the results which are applied to the cluster data in paper ii , and section [ sec : implications ] shows how these results can be applied to future space - based observations , such as the ngst .",
    "we summarize our main conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we have obtained hst nicmos images of five of m31 s metal rich globular clusters and their surrounding fields ( cycle 7 ; program i d 7826 ) .",
    "the clusters are g1 , g170 , g174 , g177 & g280 ; however most of the discussion in this paper will focus on g280 which has the densest core , one of the sparsest surrounding fields , and is dispersed enough to allow accurate cluster star measurements in its outer regions .",
    "our observations were taken with the nicmos camera 2 ( nic2 ) which has a plate scale of @xmath0 00757 pixel@xmath1 and a field of view of 194 on a side ( 376 arcsec@xmath2 ) .",
    "the nicmos focus was set at the compromise position 1 - 2 , which optimizes the focus for simultaneous observations with cameras 1 and 2 .",
    "all of our observations used the multiaccum mode @xcite because of its optimization of the detector s dynamic range and cosmic ray rejection .",
    "each of our targets was observed through three filters : f110w ( 0.81.4 ) , f160w ( 1.41.8 ) , and f222 m ( 2.152.30 ) .",
    "these filters are close to the standard ground - based @xmath3 , @xmath4 , & @xmath5 filters . each globular cluster",
    "was observed over three orbits of hst , with @xmath6 minutes of observations per orbit .",
    "this yielded total integration times of 1920s in f110w , 3328s in f160w , and 2304s in f222 m ( see table [ tab : filters ] ) .",
    "we implemented a spiral dither pattern with 4 positions to compensate for imperfections in the infrared array .",
    "the dither steps were 04 for the @xmath3 and @xmath5 band images , and 50 for the @xmath4 band images .",
    "thus the full size of the combined dithered images are @xmath7 in @xmath3 and @xmath5 , and @xmath8 in @xmath4 .",
    "we used the predefined sample sequences step32 with 22 samples in @xmath3 and 25 samples in @xmath5 , and step64 with 21 samples in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4-band image of g280 is shown in figure [ fig : g280 ] .",
    "this is the combination of 4 dither positions , and is @xmath8 on a side .",
    "our data were reduced with the stsci pipeline supplemented by the iraf nicproto package ( may 1999 ) to eliminate any residual bias ( the `` pedestal '' effect ) . to account for any bias shift which may have occurred in the nicmos reduction ( arbitrary amounts get added or subtracted during pedestal removal ) , or unsubtracted background contribution , we scale our surface brightness by adding a constant to the entire frame to agree with the surface brightness from @xcite . as an example , the procedure for the g280 frame was as follows . taking the observed position of g280 as @xmath9 from the center of m31 , and 34  from the major axis , we interpolate kent s data to find an equivalent major axis distance of @xmath10 from m31 s center . at this distance",
    "the total @xmath11-band surface brightness is @xmath12 magnitudes arcsecond@xmath13 .",
    "assuming an @xmath14 color of 2.9 from @xcite for the disk of a galaxy similar to m31 , we estimate the @xmath5-band surface brightness to be 18.3 magnitudes arcsecond@xmath13 .",
    "we then added a constant 0.045 to the count - rate in each pixel of our frame to bring the average surface brightness of the frame up to this level ( measured @xmath15 around the cluster ) .",
    "object detection was performed with daofind on a combined image made up of all the dithers of all the bands ( 12 images in total ) .",
    "psfs were constructed with daophot for each of the four dithers , then averaged together to create a single psf for each band of each target ( the average fwhm of each band is listed in table [ tab : filters ] ) .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were measured using the allframe psf fitting software package @xcite , which simultaneously fits psfs to all stars on all dithers .",
    "daogrow @xcite was used to determine the best magnitude in a @xmath16 radius aperture , which we then converted to the cit / ctio system using the transformation equations of @xcite .",

    "the measurements of stars in the m31 clusters and their surrounding fields will be affected by crowding due to the high stellar density . we have performed three types of tests to evaluate the effects of crowding on our photometry and to quantify at what surface brightness levels we can achieve accurate measurements .",
    "we compare these techniques with one another (  [ sec : comparison ] ) , and with predictions from first principles (  [ sec : simulations_vs_theory ] ) .      our first attempt to determine the effects of crowding , as well as to quantify our photometric completeness , used traditional artificial star tests .",
    "we added stars of a fixed magnitude to each individual dither using addstar @xcite , re - processed the frames , and recorded the recovered magnitudes .",
    "since we are interested in not only the completeness , but also the effects of blending , we did not incorporate a delta magnitude criterion for the recovered stars .",
    "we repeated this procedure for nine different input magnitudes @xmath17 .",
    "each trial added only 81 stars per frame to minimize additional crowding .",
    "these 81 stars were arranged in a grid with spacing of @xmath18 pixels to avoid self - crowding .",
    "the grid of input stars was then shifted by 3 pixels and the process repeated so that the entire cluster was covered in 36 trials for each of the 9 input magnitudes ( in the end an artificial star of each magnitude had been added to every 9th pixel in the region of the cluster ) .",
    "we thus input 2916 artificial stars per magnitude .",
    "not surprisingly , figure [ fig : completeness ] demonstrates that the completeness is a function of both input magnitude and distance from the cluster center .",
    "the top panel shows the fractional completeness for the entire g280 frame as a function of input magnitude . here",
    "each bin represents a total of 2916 artificial stars added 81 stars at a time .",
    "the error bars represent the dispersion in the number of recovered stars over the 36 trials .",
    "the bottom panel shows the completeness of each magnitude trial as a function of position from the center of the cluster . here",
    "the faintest input magnitude plotted is @xmath19 , which is only @xmath20% complete in the outer regions , and drops to a value consistent with zero at @xmath21 .",
    "input magnitudes from @xmath22 to @xmath23 inclusive , show essentially 100% completeness for radii @xmath24 .",
    "input magnitudes @xmath25 and @xmath23 remain 100% complete down to @xmath26 radius    figure [ fig : artstarfits ] illustrates an important aspect of the crowding problem not shown by figure [ fig : completeness ] ; the difference between input and recovered magnitudes . as will be seen , for our purposes , the traditional completeness plots ( fig [ fig : completeness ] ) are largely irrelevant .",
    "we are mainly concerned with accurately measuring the upper red giant branch ( rgb ) , and thus blending at the bright end , and not completeness at the faint end , is our primary worry .",
    "figure [ fig : artstarfits ] shows the effects of blending as a function of radial distance from the cluster .",
    "the dots are the measured objects in the g280 frame .",
    "the lines are the locus of the recovered artificial star magnitudes . at large radii @xmath27",
    "there is good correspondence between the input and the recovered ( plotted ) magnitudes ( thus the actual value of each set of input magnitudes can be obtained from the level of each line at @xmath28 ) .",
    "however at small radii , what is measured can be several magnitudes above what was input .",
    "regardless of the star s input brightness , if a star is recovered near the center of the cluster , it is recovered with the luminosity of the object on which it fell ( if it does not fall near a bright star , then it is most likely not recovered ) .",
    "note that the brightest objects measured on the real frame are all within the central few arcseconds , and that the upward curving loci of the artificial stars closely mimic the distribution of those bright stars measured on the real frame .",
    "this is indicative of the blended nature of these objects , but does not reveal their true luminosities , as _ all _ the loci of the artificial stars pass through the brightest measured objects at the center of the cluster .        from the photometric results in figure [ fig : artstarfits ] , we see that we measure predominantly very bright objects in crowded regions .",
    "the artificial star tests showed that the measurement of faint stars injected into these crowded regions will be significantly altered by the severe crowding , and these faint stars will usually be absorbed into the nearest bright object .",
    "to further investigate the nature of these bright objects , we decided that more tests were necessary .",
    "however , heeding the warning of @xcite that typical artificial star experiments can not reproduce the true effects of severe image crowding , and following the lead of @xcite , we initiated our own set of `` non  standard '' artificial star experiments .",
    "these experiments involved the simulation of the entire cluster and surrounding field using a reasonable estimate of the expected cluster star properties . starting with a blank frame with the appropriate noise characteristics , we randomly added cluster and field stars , using the same psfs determined from the g280 cluster , with any negative values set to zero .",
    "both the cluster and field stars follow the luminosity function and colors observed in the galactic bulge , as we expect the cluster stars to have similar properties , and the bulge lf is complete to faint levels in the ir .",
    "the lf is a power law with a slope of 0.278 , extending from @xmath29 ( @xmath30 at baade s window ) @xcite .",
    "later we will examine the effect of changes in the assumed input lf .",
    "colors are derived from a combination of observations of the rgb slope for @xmath31 @xcite , and from stellar models for @xmath32 ( cassisi ) .",
    "cluster stars were added according to the radial surface brightness profile measured in the real cluster until the integrated magnitude of the cluster matched that of the cluster being modeled .",
    "note that the measurement surface brightness is independent of crowding , and as long as there are not saturated pixels , which there were not , the measured sb is accurate .",
    "field stars were added randomly to approximately match the observed field star density .",
    "the artificial frames were then processed and measured in exactly the same manner as the real data .      in order to best understand the effects of crowding , we focus on the g280 observations which have the largest contrast in surface brightness between field and cluster .",
    "g280 has one of the densest cores , is one of the most extended clusters in our sample , and at the same time , has one of the sparsest fields .",
    "a280 , the artificial analog of the g280 cluster , is shown in figure [ fig : a280 ] .",
    "this frame is composed of 450,000 cluster stars and 80,000 field stars .",
    "the easiest way to differentiate between the g280 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : g280 ] ) and the a280 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a280 ] ) frames is to look for the presence ( or absence ) of bad pixels , of which there are none on the artificial frame .",
    "figure [ fig : a280lf ] shows the input ( dashed ) and measured ( solid ) luminosity functions for the a280 frame .",
    "the top panel is for the whole frame .",
    "even though the input lf cuts off at @xmath33 , the measured lf extends to @xmath34 . assuming that most of the recovered stars within @xmath35 belong to the cluster , we break the lf up into the cluster and field contributions .",
    "the middle panel shows the lf for the field around g280 , only counting objects located greater than @xmath36 from the cluster center . here",
    "the measured lf shows very good correspondence with the input lf , having identical bright end cutoffs .",
    "the faint end decline at @xmath37 is due to `` classical '' incompleteness .",
    "the bottom panel includes only objects closer then @xmath36 from the cluster center ; we assume that these are mostly cluster stars .",
    "this is where the major discrepancy between the input and recovered lf occurs .",
    "all of the stars measured brighter than the input lf cutoff , i.e. brighter than any `` real '' star , are found in this small region of the frame .",
    "we emphasize that the same lf was used for the entire frame .",
    "the a280 cmds are shown in figure [ fig : a280cmd ] where we have again divided the field spatially .",
    "objects closer than @xmath36 from the cluster center are plotted in the left panel , while objects farther than @xmath36 are in the right panel .",
    "points and circles indicate measured objects ; the locus of the input stars is indicated by the line . in the right panel",
    "there is a very good correspondence between the input and recovered magnitudes .",
    "there is very little crowding , and as a result very little scatter of the measured data around the input data .",
    "the scatter at the faint end gives an idea of the scale of the measurement errors . in the left panel",
    ", however , there is a large plume of stars measured brighter and bluer than anything input into the cluster .",
    "this blue color is an immediate indicator of the blended origin of these objects , where what is measured is not a single bright star , but the superposition of many fainter , bluer stars . using criteria developed in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we plot objects inside the threshold - blending radius , where the blending is just beginning to affect the faintest stars , at surface brightness of @xmath38 magnitudes arcsecond@xmath13 , with open circles .",
    "objects measured inside the critical - blending radius , where the surface brightness is @xmath39 and blending has severely distorted nearly all measurements , with half - size dots .",
    "note that nearly all recovered stars lie systematically to the blue of the input line for @xmath40 .",
    "this suggests that blending is affecting all stars to some degree , which is not surprising since @xmath41 is also the dividing line inside which there were added more than one star per pixel .",

    "the color spread in the g280 field cmd is real .",
    "this field is @xmath46 disk and @xmath47 bulge , with an estimated spread in [ fe / h ] of @xmath48 ( paper ii ) . the artificial a280 frame , in contrast ,",

    "the field subtracted cluster cmd of g280 also looks remarkably similar to the a280 cluster cmd ( paper ii ) .",

    "the artificial clusters simulations are , however , a more controlled experiment that offer advantages to the interpretation of the nature of the brightest measured stars .",
    "the traditional completeness tests show that some stars are brightened , but when the crowding gets severe , the brightening seems to come from falling on or near a preexisting bright clump , and measuring the brightness of the clump rather than the individual star .",
    "these tests , however , do not tell you whether the bright clumps are real . the artificial cluster simulations , on the other hand ,",
    "tell you the number and brightness of the stars which make up the clumps , and in our case , that these bright objects which are observed can be created with a normal lf whose brightest star is several magnitudes fainter than the brightest object observed .",
    "we have created uniformly populated mini - fields of @xmath65 pixels to investigate any possible effects of the strong surface brightness gradient present in the observed globular clusters .",

    "there is good agreement between the bright end extent of the input and measured lfs up to a surface brightness of @xmath69 .",
    "however as more and more stars are added to the field , blending becomes significant , the lf shifts toward brighter and brighter magnitudes , and then more stars are `` recovered '' with @xmath42 brighter than the brightest input star .",

    "our tests show that the surface brightness gradient appears inconsequential , insofar as the effects of blending on photometry are concerned .",
    "an advantage of the mini - fields over the artificial clusters is that they give a larger sample of stars at each surface brightness interval .",
    "this makes it easier to quantify at what surface brightness levels the photometry is either accurate , tainted , or corrupt .",
    "we find that many of the bright objects observed in crowded regions arise from the clumping of many fainter stars .",
    "although the traditional completeness tests do show that faint stars are artificially brightened , they do not give the whole picture .",
    "our artificial frames , which closely mimic the real hst - nicmos data , have shown that random clumps of stars can create objects several magnitudes brighter than the brightest real stars .",

    "the number of stars in each 1 magnitude range is a function of the total number of stars input ( i.e. the surface brightness ) , and the range being considered , since we use the same power - law input luminosity function .",
    "thus the statistical noise is quite high at the faint surface brightness end , especially for the brighter input curves .",

    "arcsecond@xmath13 , all stars are measured fairly accurately . however at @xmath80 the fainter stars start to become artificially brightened by crowding . with increasing surface brightness ,",
    "the effects of crowding become more and more significant for brighter stars . at @xmath81",
    "the crowding is so severe that nearly all stars are badly blended or misidentified with random clumps of blended stars , and even the brightest input stars are mismeasured by several magnitudes .    comparing the fits to the recovered artificial star magnitudes from the traditional completeness tests ( figure [ fig : completeness ] ) , and the recovered magnitudes from the artificial mini - fields ( figure [ fig : artfieldsb_deltamag ] ) ,",
    "the same effect is apparent . at some critical surface brightness , or radius in the case of our globular clusters ,",
