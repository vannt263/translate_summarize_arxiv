    "strong fe ii emission in the uv bump at 2500@xmath2 has now been detected in qsos out to @xmath4 @xmath3 6 ( freudling , corbin & korista 2003 ; barth et al .",
    "the strengths of the fe ii 2500@xmath2 feature , mg ii @xmath52800 , and the blend of c iii ] @xmath51909 , al iii @xmath51860 and si iii ] @xmath51892 lines at approximately 1900@xmath2 in these objects and the associated line ratios are quite similar to those measured in qsos at lower redshifts . while the iron emission processes in the broad line region ( blr ) remain incompletely understood , the measured line ratios suggest that the blrs in these objects have metallicities of several times the solar value ( see , e.g. , hamann et al . 2002 ; dietrich et al .",
    "2003 ) . motivated in particular by the results for objects at @xmath4 @xmath3 6 , which under the currently favored cosmology of @xmath6 = 0.7 , @xmath7 = 0.3 , @xmath8 = 0.7 corresponds to an age of the universe of approximately 0.9 gyr",
    ", we seek to refine these metallicity estimates using recent fe ii atom and galactic chemical enrichment ( gce ) models .",
    "using ferland s code cloudy , we compute several grids of photoionization models , each spanning several orders of magnitude in gas density and ionizing flux .",
    "each grid assumes a set of metal abundances corresponding to the giant elliptical starburst model used by hamann & ferland ( 1999 ) .",
    "the iron enrichment in this gce model arises primarily from type ia supernovae .",
    "we find the relations between the measured fe ii 2500@xmath2 bump / mg ii @xmath52800 flux ratio and the associated fe / mg abundance ratio using both a simplified fe ii atom model and a more recent 371-level model to be log(feii / mgii ) @xmath3",
    "-0.13 + 0.4log(fe / mg ) andlog(feii / mgii ) @xmath3 -0.13 + 0.6log(fe / mg ) , respectively .",
    "importantly , in both cases the relation is not linear , as has been assumed in some studies ( e.g. yoshii , tsujimoto & kawara 1998 ) , as the fe ii / mg ii flux ratio scales only moderately with the fe / mg abundance ratio .",
    "we additionally investigate the scaling of the fe / c abundance with the fe ii / 1900@xmath2-blend flux ratio , and find similar relations .",
    "this supports the use of this ratio as a metallicity diagnostic in objects in which mg ii @xmath52800 can not be measured ( c.f .",
    "freudling et al .",
    "using the relations derived between the fe ii 2500@xmath2 bump / mg ii @xmath52800 and fe ii 2500@xmath2 bump / 1900@xmath2-blend flux ratios and the respective cabundance ratios for the case of the 371-leve fe ii atom , we use the hamann & ferland ( 1999 ) giant elliptical gce model to predict the values of these flux ratios as a function of time , over a time scale of approximately 6 gyr from the initial starburst .",
    "interestingly , the values of these ratios do not reach those measured for @xmath4 @xmath3 6 qso ( see the references in @xmath9 1 ) until more than 1 gyr after the onset of star formation , which is inconsitent with the age of the universe at such redshifts under a @xmath6 = 0.7 , @xmath7 = 0.3 , @xmath8 = 0.7 cosmology . assuming this cosmology to be correct , this indicates that the gce models need to be refined , allowing for more rapid iron enrichment .",
    "one such refinement may be in the contribution of sne ia to the overall iron yield ; venkatesan , schneider & ferrara ( 2004 ) find that sne ia are not strongly required in order to produce the inferred iron abundances of high - redshift qsos .",
    "the detection of strong iron emission and apparent super - solar metallicities in qsos at @xmath4 @xmath3 6 places important constraints on models of galactic chemical enrichment and formation , as well as the redshifts at which the first stars in the universe formed . using the most recent fe ii atom models",
    ", we find that important diagnostic flux ratios including fe ii 2500@xmath2 / mg ii @xmath52800 scale more gradually with the abundance ratios of these elements than some studies have assumed . under currently favored cosmologies ,",
    "we additionally find an inconsistency between the values of these ratios and those predicted by recent galactic chemical evolution models , in that the values measured in objects at @xmath4 @xmath3 6 are higher than the model predictions .",
    "this indicates that refinements to these models are needed , perhaps in the amount of contribution by sne ia to the iron yield ."
