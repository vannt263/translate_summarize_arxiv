    "star formation is often affected by various external disturbances due to active phenomena such as expansion of h ii regions , uv radiation from massive stars , and shock waves from supernova remnants .",
    "in contrast , the taurus molecular cloud ( tmc ) , the most intensively studied low - mass star - forming region lying at a distance of 140 pc  @xcite , has been regarded as a site where star formation occurs spontaneously : the formation of each star progresses in an isolated environment .",
    "this is supported by the following two facts : 1 ) although the tmc is located near the center of the cas - tau ob association , the association is old ( @xmath825 myr ) and has already been dispersed into a wide area of 90@xmath9 @xmath10 40@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "2 ) since the number density of the ysos in the association is quite low , @xmath11 stars pc@xmath12  @xcite , the neighboring systems can not gravitationally interact with each other during star formation . in the l1551 dark cloud , however , the protostars such as l1551 irs 5 ( hereinafter irs 5 ) , l1551 ne ( hereinafter ne ) , hl tau , and hh 30 might be mutually affected through their outflows .",
    "irs 5 , the most luminous protostar ( @xmath13 @xmath6 30@xmath14 ) in the tmc , has powerful outflows , and ne is located just in its red - shifted outflow lobe .",
    "it is therefore likely that the environment around ne is strongly affected by the outflows  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , both hl tau and hh 30 have optical jets deeply penetrating the l1551 region , which would disturb the entire cloud : recent studies have revealed that dozens of parsec - scale hh flows driven by low - mass young stars are thought to disrupt surrounding molecular cloud cores and drive supersonic turbulence  .",
    "consequently , even in the tmc , outflows can play important roles in neighboring star formation .",
    "l1551 ne , which was discovered by emerson et al . ( 1984 ) , is the second brightest protostar ( @xmath13 @xmath6 6@xmath14 ) in the tmc , and is categorized as a class 0 object ( e.g. , barsony & chandler 1993 ) .",

    "the sources are likely to drive harbig - haro objects hh 28 , hh 29 , and hh 454 as well as the well collimated infrared [ fe ii ] jet  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the interaction features between ne and the outflow lobe of irs 5 have been revealed : high - velocity cs emission was detected around ne , and the distribution of the emission has a clumpy and shell - like structure open toward irs 5 , suggesting that the swept - up shell of the outflow from irs 5 has impacted on ne  @xcite .",
    "the detailed spatial and velocity structures of the swept - up shell , however , are still unknown owing to the insufficient angular resolutions and sensitivities . to investigate the detailed structures of the dense gas around ne and to reveal the relationship between ne and the red - shifted outflow lobe of irs 5",
    ", we made aperture synthesis observations of ne in cs ( @xmath0 ) and cs ( @xmath1 ) emissions , which trace high - density and shocked gas , with higher angular resolution and better sensitivity .",
    "aperture synthesis observations of ne were carried out in cs ( @xmath0 ) ( 97.980968 ghz ) and cs ( @xmath1 ) ( 146.969049 ghz ) with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) , which consists of six 10 m antennas , during a period from 1999 november to 2002 february .",
    "the cs images were obtained using all the array configurations , d , c , and ab , whose ranges of the projected baseline lengths were @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 k@xmath15 at 98 ghz , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 k@xmath15 at 147 ghz , respectively .",

    "the fwhm sizes of the primary beam were 70@xmath29 for 98 ghz and 51@xmath29 for 147 ghz . since the minimum baseline lengths at 98 ghz and 147 ghz were 3 k@xmath15 and 5 k@xmath15 , respectively , our observations were insensitive to structures extending more than 69@xmath29 ( 10@xmath30 au at 140 pc ) at 98 ghz and 41@xmath29 ( 6 @xmath10",

    "gives a total gas mass of 0.55 @xmath4 0.07 @xmath5 under the same assumptions as in the nma case .",
    "the flux difference can mainly be attributed to the resolving out of extended components in the nma observations . in the lvb (",
    "@xmath2 @xmath91 km s@xmath3 ) and lvr ( @xmath2 @xmath92 km s@xmath3 ) ranges , the fraction of the missing flux density is about @xmath93 % . in the hvr range ( @xmath2 @xmath94 8.5 km s@xmath3 ) and around the systemic velocity ( @xmath2 @xmath8 6.7 km s@xmath3 ) , more than 80 % of the 45 m flux density is missing .",
    "these indicate that the smoothly extended components are dominant in the hvr range as well as around the systemic velocity , suggesting that the red - shifted outflow gas from irs 5 has a smooth structure .",
    "the nma observations of the cs ( @xmath95 ) emissions have revealed the small - scale arc - shaped structure around ne and the deceleration of the outflowing gas , suggesting that a distinct interaction exists between ne and the outflowing gas . we discuss the interaction between them in   [ diss1 ] .",
    "next , we propose a plausible scenario of the outflow - triggered formation of ne in   [ diss2 ] . finally , we discuss the possibility that the outflow from irs 5 has blown off the outer envelope around ne in   [ diss3 ] .",
    "the circumstellar environment around ne has been strongly affected by the outflow from irs 5 , judging from the spatial distribution and velocity structure of the cs emission around ne .",
    "figure [ fig : fig10 ] is a schematic illustration of ne and irs 5 , which briefly summarizes our results . the large - scale cs arc - shaped structure open toward irs 5 around ne , which was revealed by the 45 m observations , is thought to trace the swept - up shell of the outflow from irs 5 , because the shell exhibits the highly red - shifted emission compared to the systemic velocities of irs 5 and ne . since ne is located at the leading edge of the shell , it is most likely that the shell has impacted on the natal core of ne .",
    "the impact of the shell on ne is strongly supported by the small - scale cs arc - shaped structure , which is newly discovered by our observations .",
    "the arc is open toward ne and exhibits the distinct deceleration feature along the outflow axis of irs 5 .",
    "these suggest that the swept - up gas accelerated by the outflow from irs 5 has impacted on ne or the natal core of ne , forming the bow - shock - like arc as well as the deceleration revealed in figure [ fig : fig8]a . here",
    ", we estimate the deceleration of the gas , @xmath96 , under a simple assumption of constant deceleration .",
    "the projected distance between ne and the peak position of the hvr component in figure [ fig : fig8]a is 20@xmath29 , corresponding to 2800 au .",
    "the hvr component has @xmath2 @xmath6 9.2 km s@xmath3 , whereas the gas associated with ne has @xmath2 @xmath6 6.7 km s@xmath3 .",
    "considering the inclination angle of the outflow from irs 5 to be @xmath97 with respect to the plane of the sky  , @xmath96 is estimated to be @xmath98 @xmath10 10@xmath12 km s@xmath3 yr@xmath3 , and the timescale of the deceleration becomes @xmath99 @xmath10 10@xmath31 yr .",
    "the comparison of the cs and h@xmath56co@xmath100 emissions suggests that ne has formed at the shock front caused by the impact of the cs shell .",
    "figure [ fig : fig11 ] shows the total intensity map of the h@xmath56co@xmath100 emission @xcite superposed onto the cs ( @xmath0 ) map of ne by this study . although both the cs and h@xmath56co@xmath100 emissions trace dense gas , their distributions show clear anti - correlation .",
    "the h@xmath56co@xmath100 emission is mainly distributed to the east of the source , which can be interpreted in terms of the depletion of h@xmath56co@xmath100 by the outflow  @xcite : bachiller & perez gutierrez ( 1997 ) suggested that the h@xmath56co@xmath100 molecules are rapidly destroyed in shocked regions owing to dissociative recombination caused by enhanced electron abundance .",
    "thus , the h@xmath56co@xmath100 emission seems to be distributed in the pre - shocked region . on the other hand , cs , a tracer of dense and shocked gas ,",
    "is mainly distributed to the west of ne , suggesting that the cs emission is distributed in the post - shocked region disturbed by the outflow of irs 5 .",
    "therefore , it is most likely that ne is located at the interface between the pre - shocked and post - shocked regions .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with the fact that the h@xmath56co@xmath100 emission was only detected within a range of @xmath101 km s@xmath3 and no high - velocity components were detected , whereas the cs emission was detected in a wide range of @xmath2 @xmath6 @xmath102 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the timescale for the interaction between the natal core of ne and the outflow of irs 5 is characterized by the crossing time in which the outflow passes through the core , although there is ambiguity in the core radius .",
    "the curvature radius of the small - scale cs arc - shaped structure , @xmath103 au , can be taken as the lower limit for the core radius , giving an interaction timescale of @xmath104 yr .",
    "this timescale is only twice the timescale of the ongoing deceleration of the cs gas of @xmath105 yr .",
    "the upper limit of the core radius , on the other hand , should be @xmath8 @xmath106 au as suggested by the continuum map at 1.3 mm ( motte  & andr 2001 ) , giving a timescale of @xmath107 yr .",
    "note that the radius of @xmath106 au agrees with the mean radius of the cores in the tmc @xcite .",
    "the possible range of the interaction timescale , therefore , is @xmath108 yr . since the separation between ne and irs 5 is @xmath109 au , only twice larger than the above upper limit of the core radius , the upper limit timescale of the interaction can also be regarded as a possible traveling time from irs 5 to ne of the outflow ( @xmath110 yr ) .",
    "in addition to the strong interaction between ne and the outflow of irs 5 , we discuss the possibility that the formation of ne was triggered by the impact of the outflow by comparing several timescales .",
    "motte  & andr ' e ( 2001 ) estimated the age of ne to be @xmath111 yr : the shortest age was derived from the assumption that the mass accretion rate declines exponentially given by @xmath112 and the longest one was derived from the steady mass accretion rate of 2.0 @xmath10 10@xmath113 @xmath5 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the interaction timescale between the ne core and the outflow from irs 5 , on the other hand , is @xmath108 yr , and this agrees with the above - mentioned age of ne . although both the estimates of timescale contain uncertainty , this agreement suggests that the mass accretion of ne was triggered by the outflow from irs 5 : it is unlikely that the ne formation and the interaction between ne and the outflow have occurred independently but simultaneously at the same place in such a short span compared with a period of the protostellar phase ( @xmath114 yr ) .",
    "this would be the first evidence for the outflow triggered star formation in low - mass star forming regions .    in the blueshifted outflow lobe of irs 5",
    ", there is another cs clump which resembles the shell near ne in spatial distribution , sizescale and the amount of velocity shifts with respect to the systemic velocity of irs 5 ( see fig.3 of plambeck & snell 1995 ) .",
    "a straight line connecting these two shells or clumps passes directly through irs 5 , suggesting these two shells were simultaneously ejected from irs 5 with similar velocities . the separation from irs 5 of the blueshifted shell ,",
    "however , is about twice larger than that of the redshifted shell near ne .",
    "this difference might be caused by the obstruction by the ne core in the redshifted outflow lobe of irs 5 .",
    "if this is the case , the duration of the interaction between the ne core and the outflow from irs 5 should be comparable to the traveling time from irs 5 to ne of the outflow .",
    "class 0 protostars are usually surrounded by dense envelopes with a few @xmath10 1000 au sizes . as they evolve ,",
    "the dense envelopes are dispersed , and t tauri stars without the envelopes appear  @xcite .",
    "ne , however , might be an exceptional class 0 protostar with a tiny envelope , which is probably caused by the impact of the swept - up shell of irs 5 . the compactness of the ne envelope is clearly demonstrated by the 1.3 mm continuum imaging survey of ysos with the iram 30 m telescope  .",
    "figure [ fig : fig12 ] shows the compactness of ysos defined by the ratio of the peak intensity with an 11@xmath29 beam to the flux density within a diameter of 60@xmath29 at 1.3 mm . although ne has a low bolometric temperature of 75 k , the degree of the compactness of 60 % is considerably high compared to the other class 0 objects .",
    "moriarty - schieven et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also showed that the 1.3 mm flux density of 0.851 @xmath4 0.084 jy obtained by the ovro interferometer ( 1@xmath1629 @xmath10 1@xmath1607 in hpbw ) agrees with that of 0.83 @xmath4 0.03 jy obtained by the jcmt ( 20@xmath29 in hpbw ) within the errors , indicating that the dust emission is centrally condensed .",
    "furthermore , the ne component seen in figures [ fig : fig4 ] & [ fig : fig6 ] has a small size of @xmath8 1000 au , suggesting the gas envelope is also compact .",
    "one possible interpretation of such an unusually compact envelope is that the swept - up shell accelerated by the outflow from irs 5 , which likely to trigger the ne formation , has blown off the outer parts of the envelope .",
    "the outflow of irs 5 seems to have enough power to blow off the circumstellar envelope around ne as follows : the momentum flux put into the dense gas around ne by the decelerating swept - up shell is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the mass of the swept - up shell of 0.18 @xmath5 , and is estimated to be @xmath117 10@xmath118 @xmath5 km s@xmath3 yr@xmath3 .",
    "here we assume that all the momentum flux which the outflow lost is put into the dense gas for simplicity .",
    "on the other hand , for a typical protostar with a mass of 0.5 @xmath5 surrounded by an envelope with 2000 au radius and 0.1@xmath119 mass , the momentum required to dissipate the envelope would be 7.0 @xmath10 10@xmath86 @xmath5 km s@xmath3 . since the age of ne is @xmath120 10@xmath30 yr , the momentum flux required to blow off the envelope have to be larger than @xmath121 10@xmath122 @xmath5 km s@xmath3 yr@xmath3 .",
    "this flux is one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath123 , indicating that the outflow from irs 5 might have blown off the outer parts of the envelope around ne .",
    "we have presented the new results of the high angular resolution and high sensitivity cs ( @xmath0/@xmath1 ) observations of the protostar l1551 ne .",
    "the main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "both the cs ( @xmath0 ) and ( @xmath1 ) emissions were detected from @xmath2 @xmath6 5.3 to 10.1 km s@xmath3 , and their distributions are quite similar to each other .",
    "the arc - shaped structure open toward ne and the compact disklike structure at the ne position were clearly resolved .",
    "the total mass of the dense gas is estimated to be 0.18 @xmath4 0.02 @xmath5 , and the mass contained in the disklike structure is ( 1.0 @xmath4 0.1 ) @xmath10 10@xmath86 @xmath5 .",
    "2 .    one - arcsec resolution imaging of 3 mm and 2 mm continuum emission has revealed the disklike structure , perpendicular to the [ fe ii ] jet and the hh jets hh 28 , 29 , and 454 .",
    "the size of the structure is 1@xmath1639 @xmath10 1@xmath1600 ( 200 au @xmath10 140 au ) at p.a . of 159 @xmath4 13@xmath9 and",
    "the estimated mass is 0.032 @xmath4 0.003 @xmath5 .",
    "although ne is a binary system consisting of ne - a and ne - b , the main contributor of the dust continuum emission seems to be ne - a .",
    "the cs gas around ne shows the distinct velocity gradient along the outflow axis of irs 5 .",
    "this can be explained by the deceleration of the swept - up shell accelerated by the outflow from irs 5 , suggesting that the swept - up shell has impacted on ne .",
    "the distributions of the cs and h@xmath56co@xmath100 emissions show clear anti - correlation , suggesting that cs is abundant in the post - shocked regions , whereas h@xmath56co@xmath100 is abundant in the pre - shocked regions .",
    "since the timescale of the interaction is comparable to the age of ne , it is likely that the formation of ne was triggered by the impact of the swept - up shell of the outflow from irs 5 .",
    "our and previous results suggest that ne has a compact circumstellar envelope with a size of @xmath8 1000 au , although ne is categorized as a class 0 object .",
    "the outer parts of the envelope might be blown off by the outflow from irs 5 , because the momentum put in by the swept - up shell is sufficient to blow off the envelope .",
