    "this is our second paper in a series of papers in which several physical ideas , ( i ) the t hooft holographic principle @xcite , in particular the ads / cft correspondence @xcite ; ( ii ) the green s world - sheets for worlds - sheets @xcite ; ( iii ) topological quantum numbers as central charges of superalgebras @xcite , are used as the keystones upon which better understanding of superstring theory on some curved space - times , specifically @xmath0 , should be achieved .",
    "the possible relation of string theory on @xmath0 to two - dimensional conformal field theory has been a subject of much interest ( see , e.g. , [ 7 - 18 ] and references therein is an old story ( for earlier discussions of this issue see @xcite and references therein ) . ] ) and has led to a proposal for new representations of generators of some kac - moody and superconformal ( supervirasoro ) algebras @xcite .",
    "thanks to the underlying world - sheet structure such construction may be called the stringy representation of affine algebras ( superalgebras ) .",
    "so far , however , the missing point of these stringy realizations of the algebras has been their representations",
    ". since we are interested in physics it is natural to restrict ourselves to a particular class of representations , namely the unitary highest weight representations .",
    "according to @xcite , the hilbert space of any two - dimensional conformal field theory decomposes into holomorphic and anti - holomorphic sectors , so it makes sense to start with considering one of them , say holomorphic .",
    "moreover , the holomorphic sector itself is a direct product of representations .",
    "thus our purpose is to build the representations in certain two - dimensional constructions that are of a particular physical interest .",
    "however , before we give examples it might be useful to present some mathematical background .    in general , given a finite - dimensional lie algebra @xmath2 , the untwisted affine kac - moody algebra @xmath3 is simply defined by @xmath4\\oplus \\mathbf{c}k\\oplus\\mathbf{c}d$ ] , where @xmath5 is a central element and @xmath6 is a derivation @xcite .",
    "there are several candidates for what the parameter @xmath7 can be . since we are interested in 2d conformal field theory , our candidate is a coordinate on a riemann surface .",
    "indeed , this is exactly what we need to build conformal field theory from representations of the virasoro ( kac - moody ) algebra , namely to define a construction attaching a representation of @xmath3 to a point on the surface .",
    "this is an old story , however .",
    "now , let us assume that there is a new riemann surface whose coordinate is @xmath8 such that @xmath7 is a function of @xmath8 .",
    "such an assumption arises naturally if one thinks of the second riemann surface as the world - sheet for the first one , i.e. these are the green s world - sheets for world - sheets .",
    "more rigorously , let @xmath9 be a point on the world - sheet which is a riemann surface and @xmath10 be a coordinate patch such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a point on another two - dimensional manifold ( space - time ) and @xmath14 be a proper coordinate patch .",
    "let there be a map @xmath15 , i.e. a local embedding of the world - sheet into the space - time .",
    "it is useful to classify such maps by their degrees , i.e. integers @xmath5 given by @xmath16 where the contour @xmath17 surrounds @xmath18 .",
    "thanks to the local construction @xmath17 is contractible on the world - sheet .",
    "the normalization is fixed by setting @xmath19 for @xmath20 i.e. , @xmath21 . in the quantum case @xmath5",
    "will be interpreted as the central ( topological ) charge is interpreted as the number of infinitely stretched fundamental strings at the boundary of @xmath0 while in the framework of the @xmath22 system @xmath23 is called the `` bose - sea level '' . ] .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . as a warmup , we start in section 2 by describing how a simple set of free fields on the world - sheet , namely a bosonic first order system together with a scalar field provides the @xmath24 algebra in the space - time . we show that it is natural to consider two types of representations of this algebra .",
    "the first type is generated by string vertices i.e. , vertex operators whose conformal dimensions in @xmath8 are @xmath25 , integrated over @xmath26 .",
    "we call these as the stringy representations .",
    "the second type is similar to the representations known from 2d conformal field theory .",
    "they are generated by vertex operators whose conformal dimensions in @xmath8 are arbitrary .",
    "so , we call them as the cft representations .",
    "both constructions lead to the unitary representations of @xmath24 .",
    "we then go on in section 3 to generalize the results of section 2 for any affine lie algebra @xmath27 of a , d , e type .",
    "this is done by simply adding more scalar fields such that their number equals rank@xmath28 . on the one hand , this construction is reminiscent of the vertex operator construction due to the same number of the scalar fields . on the other hand ,",
    "it is similar to the wakimoto free field representation due to the presence of the bosonic first order system .",
    "however , this is , in fact , a new construction for free field representations of affine lie algebras . as far as we know",
    ", it has not been studied in the mathematical literature yet .    in section 4 , we generalize the construction of section 2 by adding a new scalar field with a proper background charge . in this formulation , we show that on the one hand , the space - time theory possesses the @xmath1 superconformal algebra but , on the other hand , the underlying world - sheet theory possesses the @xmath29 algebra of level 1 .",
    "this is an interesting phenomenon that provides evidence for a hybrid of the nsr and gs formulations for string propagation on @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , starting with the nsr formalism assuming all machinery of 2d cft , we do not need the @xmath30 structure , i.e. superconformal symmetry , on the world - sheet to get the manifest space - time supersymmetry !    finally , section 5 will present our conclusions and directions for future work .",
    "let us consider first the @xmath24 algebra in the space - time . for a quantum field",
    "@xmath31 which classically defines the embedding of the world - sheet into the space - time , we introduce its conjugate field @xmath32 so that these define a first order @xmath22 system of weight @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , let us assume that there is one more free field on the world - sheet . for simplicity ,",
    "let it be a scalar field @xmath34 without a background charge , which provides the @xmath35 theory .",
    "it is well - known that its fock spaces are the representations of the @xmath24 affine lie algebra at the level @xmath19 . to be precise , in the fock spaces the corresponding holomorphic currents ( generation functions of @xmath24 generators )",
    "are represented by @xmath36 this is the simplest case of the vertex operator construction , by which a simply - laced affine lie algebra at the level @xmath25 can be realized in terms of free scalar fields without background charges @xcite .",
    "a possible way to formulate the space - time @xmath24 algebra is to define its generators as @xcite @xmath37 for @xmath38 , this definition reduces to @xmath39 that agrees , of course , with the definition of the generators for the centerless @xmath24 algebra @xcite .",
    "conformal techniques may be used to calculate the commutation relations . by using the op expansions @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42",
    ", one finds @xmath43=\\mathbf{k}n\\delta_{n+m,0 }    \\quad,\\quad    [ \\mathbf{h}_n,\\mathbf{e}^{\\pm}_m]=\\pm\\sqrt 2\\mathbf{e}^{\\pm}_{m+n }    \\quad,\\quad    [ \\mathbf{e}^+_n,\\mathbf{e}^-_m]=\\mathbf{k}n\\delta_{n+m,0}+    \\sqrt2\\mathbf{h}_{n+m }    \\quad\\ ] ] together with @xmath44=[\\mathbf{e}^{\\pm}_n,\\mathbf{k}]=0    \\quad.\\ ] ] here the central element @xmath45 is defined by , but the field @xmath7 is now quantized",
    ".    however , this can not be the whole story , for the reason indicated in the introduction .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath24 algebra possesses the unitary highest weight representations that are defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath46 be the highest weight vector of @xmath24 with the weight @xmath47 namely , @xmath48 the representation @xmath49 is built as the verma module over @xmath24 generated by the vector @xmath46 .",
    "note that the unitary representations only exist for @xmath50 since we are interested in stringy applications it is natural to look for the unitary representations .",
    "one more reason which forces us to do this is the integer level @xmath5 . for such values , other degenerate representations ( admissible reps . )",
    "do not appear .    for reasons that are standard and will become clear latter",
    ", it is convenient to first bosonize the @xmath22 system .",
    "the general recipe of @xcite tells us to set @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the scalar fields with proper background charges and two - point functions normalized as @xmath53 .    in terms of these scalar fields ,",
    "generators take the form @xmath54 moreover , the formula for the central element @xmath45 becomes @xmath55      in general , the integrands of the string vertex operators corresponding to the physical states are primary conformal fields .",
    "moreover , the reparametrization ( conformal ) invariance of the theory dictates that such primaries have dimension one in both @xmath8 and @xmath56 so that their integral over @xmath57 is invariant ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this definition or more exactly its holomorphic version is equivalent to @xmath58=0    \\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a string vertex operator and @xmath60 are the virasoro generators on the world - sheet i.e. , @xmath61 as a small technical matter , one can check that the generators satisfy this requirement .",
    "so they are the string vertex operators .",
    "looking for a highest weight vector of the algebra @xmath24 , we see that there is a natural possibility : @xmath62 in fact , the action of @xmath63 on string vertex operators of this type is defined by @xmath64 the parameters @xmath65 are easily determined . according to",
    ", the action of @xmath66 on @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 , so @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , @xmath45 acts as @xmath70 , which results in @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , we know that the integrand of the string vertex is the conformal primary of dimension @xmath25 or , equivalently , it must obey .",
    "this is true for @xmath72 such that @xmath73 .",
    "thus the allowed values of @xmath72 are @xmath74 , respectively .    the above definition can also be written as @xmath75\\ ] ] by rescaling @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a proper cocycle factor .",
    "it is explicitly given by @xmath78 with @xmath79 .    before going on , it is interesting to look at the structure of the integrand for the above vertex operator .",
    "the operator @xmath80 turns out to be the highest weight vector for the @xmath81 multiplet of the @xmath35 theory , while the remaining operator @xmath82 can be interpreted as an operator that interpolates between the various bose sea levels of the @xmath22 system , shifting the level by @xmath83 , actually , this does not create an exact vacuum of the @xmath22 system with the bose sea - level @xmath23 from the vacuum whose bose sea - level is zero .",
    "we will return to a discussion of this point in the next subsection . ] . on the other hand",
    ", it makes sense to speak of the level @xmath25 @xmath84 conformal field theory dressed by the @xmath22 system due to some analogy with 2d gravity or , equivalently , @xmath85 dimensional string theory .",
    "effectively , this @xmath84 theory has two primary fields corresponding to the highest weight vectors namely , @xmath25 and @xmath86 because @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , it is at first sight natural to expect that the primaries of the space - time theory are these @xmath84 fields dressed by proper @xmath22 fields .",
    "we will show a little bit later that the allowed values of @xmath47 are @xmath88 .",
    "this means that we need fields that are outside the basic grid of the level @xmath25 @xmath84 conformal field theory .",
    "it is well - known that the same phenomenon happens in 2d gravity coupled to the minimal conformal matter .",
    "now , we come to more a detailed analysis of by using . for @xmath89 , we get @xmath90 from , we see that @xmath5 must be integer",
    ". otherwise the contour integrals would be ill - defined",
    ". moreover , @xmath5 must be positive for @xmath67 to be annihilated by @xmath89 with @xmath91 .",
    "in particular , @xmath66 acts as claimed before .",
    "similarly , @xmath92 act as @xmath93 first of all let us note that the contour integrals are well - defined only for @xmath94 . by considering the @xmath95 with @xmath96",
    ", we see that all of the integrands are non - singular for @xmath97 .",
    "thus these generators annihilate @xmath67 . on",
    "the other hand , negative powers of @xmath98 may arise for @xmath99 with @xmath91 unless @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the highest weight vectors exist only for @xmath101 , which is of course the desired result because exactly such values of @xmath47 and @xmath5 define the unitary representations ( see ) .",
    "thus we have built the highest weight vectors for the @xmath24 algebra defined by .",
    "it remains to show that the verma modules generated by such vectors contain only the string vertex operators .",
    "this can be done inductively , using the fact that @xmath89 , @xmath92 and @xmath67 are stringy .",
    "if we take , for example , @xmath102 then @xmath103 or taking the cocycle factor into account , @xmath104    = [ l_m,[\\mathbf{h}_n,{\\cal o}^\\mu]]=    [ \\mathbf{h}_n,[l_m,{\\cal o}^\\mu]]-    [ { \\cal o}^\\mu,[l_m,\\mathbf{h}_n]]=0    \\quad.\\ ] ] the same can be easily repeated for a general state from the verma module .",
    "so we have built the unitary highest weight representations of @xmath24 . at this point ,",
    "a couple of comments are in order .",
    "\\(i ) in addition to the highest weight vectors built above , there are other vectors that may be important in the future .",
    "first let us determine the string vertices corresponding to the lowest weight vectors for the @xmath81 multiplets of the @xmath35 theory .",
    "they are related to the highest weight vectors as @xmath105 . after a simple calculation",
    ", we find @xmath106 now we want to continue calculations to determine the stringy vertices corresponding to some of the singular vectors of @xmath107 .",
    "the singular vectors of interest are @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we see from and that there is no short distance singularity in the integrand corresponding to @xmath110 .",
    "thus , it must vanish for @xmath97 . similarly",
    ", a relatively long but straightforward calculation shows that @xmath111 for @xmath100 .",
    "\\(ii ) having the representation @xmath107 of the space - time @xmath24 algebra , it is worth saying about the space - time meaning of such states .",
    "in fact , the dictionary for comparing the conformal family ( fields ) to the space of states ( representation ) is known @xcite .",
    "let us give an example of the use of this dictionary .",
    "for the highest weight vector @xmath67 , we have @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the primary field .",
    "it is clear that it is nothing but the zero mode of @xmath114 in our cylindrical coordinates @xmath115 . on general grounds",
    ", it immediately comes to mind to introduce a new string vertex operator @xmath116 that corresponds to the @xmath117th mode of @xmath114 .",
    "what we have done so far was just to learn how to build the stringy representations for @xmath24 given by .",
    "now we go over to conformal field theory . in doing so",
    ", we must bear in mind that the primary conformal fields may generally have dimensions that are different from one , and then their integrals over @xmath26 are not invariant .",
    "let @xmath118 be the primary field setting at @xmath12 .",
    "in the framework of cft ( see @xcite ) , the action of the virasoro ( kac - moody ) generators on @xmath118 is defined by @xmath119 here @xmath120 means the stress tensor of a world - sheet theory .",
    "likewise , we define the action for the stringy generators @xmath121    looking for highest weight vectors of @xmath24 , we see again that there is a natural possibility : @xmath122 where @xmath123 should be interpreted as the exact vacuum operator of the @xmath22 system whose bose sea level is @xmath124 .",
    "its ope s with @xmath125 and @xmath7 @xmath126 result in @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "now we will briefly discuss the application of these ideas to the construction of the unitary representations .",
    "the parameters @xmath124 and @xmath128 are found by evaluating @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    ".   thus takes the form @xmath131 moreover , it can be shown that @xmath114 turns out to be the highest weight vector only if @xmath5 and @xmath47 obey .",
    "in addition to the highest weight vector , there are other states that may be easily determined .",
    "one state is @xmath132 , which corresponds to the lowest weight vector of the @xmath81 multiplet .",
    "the second is @xmath133 , which corresponds to the singular vector of the verma module @xmath107 generated by the highest weight vector @xmath134 .",
    "finally , we have @xmath135 , which corresponds to the second singular vector of @xmath107 . at this point",
    "a remark is in order .",
    "it is well - known that the fock space of @xmath115 ( large space ) is twice as large as the fock space of @xmath136 ( small space ) @xcite . to be more precise , it is defined as @xmath137 , where @xmath138 .",
    "our definition of the space - time generators includes negative powers of @xmath7 that automatically leads to @xmath139 . indeed , @xmath140 that does not vanish for @xmath141 .",
    "thus we have the large space .",
    "now , what is special about the examples we have given in this section ? to understand that , note that the same arguments that show that @xmath134 given by eq .   is the highest weight vector show that it is invariant under @xmath142 with an arbitrary parameter @xmath143 .",
    "so , the highest weight vector takes the following form @xmath144 we considered two special cases : @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "an obvious generalization of what we have just done is the following .",
    "consider a set of scalar fields @xmath147 without background charges .",
    "this ensures that it is possible to construct the level @xmath25 representation of @xmath27 whenever @xmath28 is a simply - laced algebra i.e. , it has equal length roots and hence is of the a , d , e type .",
    "this is the so - called vertex operator construction @xcite . in the cartan - weyl basis of @xmath28 , the corresponding holomorphic currents ( generation functions )",
    "are represented by @xmath148 where @xmath149 , @xmath150 is a root of @xmath28 , @xmath151 is a cocycle factor ( see e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "all roots have length @xmath152 .",
    "the two - point functions of the free fields are normalized as @xmath153 .",
    "we take the space - time generators to be @xmath154 which is a natural generalization to arbitrary @xmath28 of what we had for @xmath81 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath155 , the definition agrees with the definition of the generators for a centerless affine algebra @xcite .",
    "now , let us calculate the commutation relations of the space - time generators . using conformal techniques , we obtain @xmath156 &      = \\mathbf{k}n\\delta^{ij}\\delta_{n+m,0 } \\quad,\\quad      [ \\mathbf{h}^i_n,\\mathbf{e}^{\\alpha}_m]=\\alpha^i\\mathbf{e}^{\\alpha}_{m+n }      \\quad , \\\\      [ \\mathbf{e}^{\\alpha}_n,\\mathbf{e}^{\\beta}_m ] & =      \\begin{cases }        \\varepsilon(\\alpha,\\beta)\\mathbf{e}^{\\alpha+\\beta}_{n+m } &        \\text { if          $ \\alpha+\\beta$ is a root of $ \\mathfrak{g}$}\\quad , \\\\",

    "it is well - known that @xmath27 possesses the unitary highest weight representations that are defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath46 be the highest weight vector satisfying @xmath160 the representation @xmath107 is built as the verma module over @xmath27 generated by the vector @xmath46 .",
    "there is a simple set of necessary and sufficient conditions for there to be a unitary highest weight representation of @xmath27 in which @xmath5 and @xmath47 take special values ; it is @xmath161    it is straightforward to rewrite the space - time generators of @xmath27 in terms of the scalar fields . using , we find @xmath162      first , to complete our discussion of the space - time generators , we should perhaps point out that in the problem at hand , they obey @xmath163=[l_n,\\mathbf{e}^\\alpha_m]=0    \\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 are the virasoro generators on the world - sheet i.e. , @xmath164 thus , they are the string vertex operators .    now , our task is to build the unitary highest weight representations for @xmath27 given by . in the @xmath84 case that we have considered , it is not hard to guess how to do this . in a similar way we can try to define @xmath67 as @xmath165",
    "the only difference is therefore that @xmath128 has become a @xmath166-dimensional vector .",
    "the next step in finding the highest weight vector is to adopt the prescription in the present situation . by using this definition ,",
    "the parameters @xmath72 , @xmath167 may be explicitly determined as follows . according to",
    ", the action @xmath168 on @xmath67 is given by @xmath169 , hence @xmath170 .",
    "similarly , @xmath45 acts as @xmath70 that results in @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , we know that @xmath67 must commute with @xmath171 given by . the last is true only for @xmath72 such that @xmath172 .",
    "thus , the allowed values of @xmath72 are @xmath173 . before going on ,",
    "let us note that it is also straightforward to write the action in the form of by rescaling @xmath174 , where @xmath77 is a cocycle factor . in this case",
    ", it is given by @xmath175 with @xmath176 .",
    "the product @xmath177 is defined as @xmath178 , where @xmath179 , @xmath180 ; @xmath181 , @xmath182 are the fundamental weights and simple roots of @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "let us now examine the operators @xmath67 more closely .",
    "the basic tool is conformal field technique .",
    "the evaluation of the actions for @xmath183 gives @xmath184 it immediately follows that the contour integrals are well - defined only for @xmath185 .",
    "this is in harmony with what we have , since our topological construction of @xmath5 allows only integer values .",
    "moreover , we see that @xmath183 with @xmath91 annihilate @xmath186 because the integrand is non - singular for @xmath187 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath188 would not vanish .",
    "in particular , @xmath168 act as claimed before .    in a similar way one can also find the actions for @xmath189 .",
    "these are given by @xmath190 this time the contour integrals are well - defined if @xmath191 . by considering @xmath192 and @xmath91",
    ", we see that the corresponding @xmath189 annihilate @xmath67 for @xmath193 . on the other hand",
    ", we see that there is a restriction @xmath194 that guarantees the vanishing of all @xmath195 for @xmath91 and negative roots .",
    "thus we have recovered the standard conditions and have succeeded in finding the highest weight vectors for the unitary representations of @xmath27 .",
    "it remains to show that the verma modules generated by such vectors contain only the string vertex operators .",
    "the analysis proceeds exactly as in the previous section .",
    "the basis point is that all operators @xmath183 , @xmath189 and @xmath67 are stringy . as a consequence ,",
    "any state from the verma module turns out to be stringy too .",
    "this completes our construction of the unitary representations for @xmath27 .",
    "in addition to the highest weight vectors built above , there are other important vectors that may be easily determined .",
    "let us give a couple of examples .",
    "for instance , we can find the lowest weight vectors for the @xmath28 multiplet .",
    "a short computation shows that these are @xmath196 .",
    "moreover , having the set of roots @xmath197 , we can choose a simple root @xmath198 among them .",
    "it is well - known that the singular vector associated with this simple root is @xmath199 .",
    "a simple dimensional analysis shows that @xmath200 within our construction .",
    "we will briefly summarize the generalization for an arbitrary simply - laced algebra @xmath2 .",
    "first of all , the highest weight vector is given by @xmath201 where @xmath123 is again the @xmath124-vacuum operator of the @xmath22 system .",
    "the primary field is setting at @xmath12 .",
    "the parameters @xmath124 and @xmath128 are found by evaluating the @xmath168 and @xmath45 on .",
    "thus , the hight weight vector becomes @xmath202    moreover , a simple analysis again shows that @xmath203 and @xmath5 must obey , i.e. the representation we built is unitary .",
    "in addition to the highest weight vector , the lowest weight vector of the @xmath2 multiplet may be easily determined .",
    "it is given by @xmath204 .",
    "moreover , the singular vectors @xmath205 vanish .",
    "we now want to reconsider the above discussion in the context of supersymmetry .",
    "one of the most interesting problems of this kind concerns the @xmath1 superconformal algebra .",
    "there are at least two reasons to say so .",
    "the first is its appearance in a description of superstring propagation on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the second is that the algebra includes @xmath24 as a subalgebra , so we need a slight generalization of what we have done in section 2 .",
    "first let us make a short detour to summarize several results obtained in @xcite .    according to the arguments by ito and further elucidated by ourselves , adding fermionic coordinates geometrically turns space - time into a superspace .",
    "more precisely , this means that we add to the @xmath22 system a set of first order fermionic systems of weights @xmath33 . to get the space - time @xmath1 superconformal algebra",

    "thus we have the @xmath35 theory and an additional theory with @xmath211 . to generalization our treatment in section 2 , we therefore need to add the scalar field @xmath212 with the background charge .",

    ", it is necessary to make a remark .",
    "one of the important statements about the @xmath1 superconformal algebra was the following observation by schwimmer and seiberg @xcite .",
    "there is an infinite set of independent sectors ( algebras ) of @xmath1 labeled by an angular valued parameter corresponding to the conjugate classes of @xmath84 .",
    "thus representations for a given value of the central charge @xmath224 are not equivalent for different values of the parameter . in our discussion",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the neveu - schwarz sector , so @xmath225 in and below .",
    "of course , it seems interesting to develop our approach for a general case elsewhere .",
    "it is well - known ( see @xcite ) that the @xmath1 superconformal algebra possesses the unitary highest weight representations that are defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath226 be the highest weight vector , namely @xmath227 the representation @xmath228 is built as the verma module over @xmath1 generated by the vector @xmath226 .",
    "it turns out that there exist two classes of the unitary representations : @xmath229    we pause here to point out a subtlety that we have not revealed so far .",
    "the preceding analysis of the commutation relations and the representations is valid only for well - defined integrands . in other words , the integrands of for the cft representations ( or for the stringy representations )",
    "are single - valued as @xmath230 goes around the origin @xmath231 so that the integration contour closes ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this is compatible with the claim that the level @xmath5 and the weights take special discrete values .",
    "it is amusing that these values correspond to unitary representations ( see ) .",
    "in other words , the local objects of the world - sheet theory result in the unitary space - time theory .",
    "on the other hand , suppose that we replace the discrete values of the weights by generic ones .",
    "the main point is that the integration contour no longer closes .",
    "a possible way to bring the situation under control is to define a new integration contour as shown in fig.2        the object just defined is similar to the screened vertex operator of cft , but one detail is different , namely we have a representation of @xmath28 rather than @xmath232 , as is usual in cft .",
    "note that such construction is nonlocal since it defines the bilocal objects that depend on two points @xmath18 and @xmath233 , where the cut ends .",
    "the last does not sound reasonable within string theory .",
    "for the unitary representations of simply - laced algebras , this is not so because they have the discrete values of the weights .",
    "however , the massive representations of @xmath1 exhibit a continuum in the spectrum of conformal dimensions that can affect the locality of a theory on the world - sheet ) , see @xcite . ] .",
    "at the present time it is not known whether the situation may be taken under control .",
    "so we are bound to learn something if we succeed .",
    "now we want to build the highest weight representations on the @xmath1 algebra within cft . in this setting",
    ", it is natural to start by writing down the highest weight vector in the following form : @xmath234 note that the approach we use is similar to that of subsection 3.2 , but the problem is different . in particular",
    ", we have the scalar field @xmath212 with the background charge .",
    "the generators @xmath45 , @xmath235 and @xmath236 must act on @xmath237 according to . for this to be so , the bose sea level @xmath124 must have the value @xmath23 . also , the allowed values of @xmath238 , @xmath239 must be @xmath240 and @xmath241 , respectively .",
    "thus , the highest weight vector is @xmath242 to be more precise about this , to convince the reader that this is indeed the case , we have to prove the statement .",
    "this is proved by explicitly evaluating actions of the @xmath1 generators on the highest weight vector .    for @xmath243",
    ", we get @xmath244 it immediately follows that the contour integral is well - defined only for @xmath185 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath243 with @xmath91 annihilate @xmath237 only if @xmath187 .",
    "that is in harmony with what we had before .",
    "now , let us see what happens when @xmath245 act on the highest weight vector .",
    "for @xmath246 , the actions are given by @xmath247 this means that the contour integral is well - defined only for @xmath248 .",
    "moreover , one can specify @xmath117 to determine the allowed values of @xmath249 . for @xmath250 , @xmath251 , which implies @xmath252 . for @xmath253 ,",
    "@xmath254 must also vanish , which leads to @xmath255 .",
    "the latter is exactly the property of the massless representations . for @xmath256 ,",
    "we have @xmath257 we see that all of the integrands are non - singular for @xmath91 , so such the @xmath256 annihilate @xmath258 . as to @xmath236 , it acts as claimed before .",
    "now , let us turn to the fermionic generators . in this discussion , we neglect the cocycle factors as they result in irrelevant numerical factors .",
    "for the fermionic generators @xmath259 , we have @xmath260 we see that the integrand is single - valued i.e. , the integration contour closes , if @xmath261 .",
    "this requirement and the requirement @xmath255 found in above imply , together , that we only get the massless representations within our construction . in a similar way , for the @xmath262 , we have @xmath263 that gives rise to @xmath261 . as the result",
    ", we are again restricted to the massless representations .",
    "thus , as promised in the introduction to this section , the local objects of the world - sheet theory result in the unitary space - time theory ; in contrast to the affine lie algebras ( at least a , d , e type ) , however , we have not found the all unitary representations . the problem occurs with the massive representations when there exists a continuum in the spectrum of conformal dimensions .    to understand what is special about these massless representations , it helps to consider their singular vectors .",
    "first , we consider the `` bosonic '' singular vectors i.e. , the ones obtained by applying bosonic generators to the highest weight vector .",
    "these are simply @xmath264 and @xmath265 . the analysis proceeds exactly as in subsection 2.1 and shows that the vectors vanish .",
    "moreover , being the massless representation , the verma module generated by @xmath266 possesses the `` fermionic '' singular vectors @xcite .",
    "the vectors of interest are @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "setting @xmath269 as well as @xmath270 in , we see that the integrand is regular . as a result",
    ", we get @xmath271 . on the other hand",
    ", equation gives @xmath272 .",
    "thus , the representation we built is reducible .",
    "of course , one can try to perform the same analysis for the stringy representations .",
    "however , we do not see much sense in this because the construction does not catch the massive representations .",
    "so , something is missing in our understanding .",
    "finally , we will present a description of the underlying world - sheet algebra that is more precise than we gave in @xcite . to begin with , we review the original analysis . in the framework of the free fields @xmath22",
    ", @xmath206 , @xmath207 , there exists the following representation of the affine superalgebra @xmath273 at the level @xmath274 @xmath275 whose op expansions are @xmath276 where @xmath277 .",
    "@xmath278 is the antisymmetric tensor with @xmath279 , where @xmath280 .",
    "the tensors @xmath221 are in the representation @xmath281 moreover , @xmath282 .",
    "of course , the space - time @xmath1 generators can be rewritten in terms of the world - sheet @xmath273 generators , which provides a new relation between these algebras @xcite .",
    "although such construction looks in many ways attractive , we have to stress a subtle point here",
    ". the central charge of @xmath273 identically equals zero while the free fields have a total central charge @xmath283 .",
    "so , some world - sheet degrees of freedom are missing . to understand what happened",
    ", it helps to bosonize the fermionic fields as we have done in subsection 4.1 .",
    "then the bosonic generators are rewritten as @xmath284 due to the above formula , we can think of @xmath285 as the scalar field that provides the world - sheet @xmath24 algebra at the level @xmath25 ( see ) . as for @xmath286",
    ", it corresponds to the @xmath287 current in the wakimoto free field representation of @xmath288 @xcite . however , the metric signature is now @xmath289 .",
    "the rest of the currents is given by @xmath290 it is not difficult to find the level of @xmath288 which turns out to be @xmath25 .",
    "thus , we have the world - sheet @xmath29 algebra at the levels @xmath25 . the central charge of this model exactly equals @xmath291 .",
    "moreover , the sugawara construction results in the stress - tensors of the free fields .",
    "this allows us to say that all degrees of freedom are taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the fermionic generators are simply given in terms of @xmath29 primaries by @xmath292 here @xmath293 and @xmath294 belong to the @xmath84 and @xmath295 conformal field theories , respectively .",
    "their weights are @xmath296 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath297    before going on , it would be interesting to interpret the @xmath1 highest weight vectors as representations of the underlying world - sheet @xmath29 algebra . in thinking about this question ,",
    "a natural analogy arises with 2d gravity .",
    "this may be seen explicitly as follows . in the @xmath84 conformal field theory ( wzw model at a fixed point ) of level @xmath25 , there are only two primary fields which belong to the basic grid of the model , i.e. @xmath298 .",
    "therefore , it is at first sight natural to expect that the @xmath1 primary fields are these @xmath84 fields dressed by proper @xmath295 fields . from our discussion of this issue",
    ", we have seen that there are , however , extra states for @xmath299 appearing as dressed type states outside the basic grid , i.e. @xmath300 are not primary for the @xmath84 wzw model of level @xmath25 . ] .",
    "it is well - known that the same happened within 2d gravity coupled to the minimal conformal matter .",
    "we will here conclude this section with brief observations about string theory on @xmath301 .",
    "it has been much studied recently in both the nsr and gs formulations ( see , e.g. , [ 7 - 18 , 30 - 32 ] and refs . therein ) . here",
    "we will note interesting facts relevant to this problem .",
    "the starting point within the nsr approach to string theory on @xmath301 is first to consider the corresponding bosonic theory .",
    "this usually involves the @xmath302 wzw model as a keystone . to extend the analysis to superstrings , the virasoro ( conformal ) algebra on the world - sheet",
    "is replaced by the @xmath30 superconformal algebra .",
    "technically , this is achieved by introducing free fermions taking their values in the lie algebra @xmath303 .",
    "the nsr framework makes it possible to discuss a lot but it is not very convenient for discussing the space - time supersymmetry because it requires working in all pictures simultaneously . in other words ,",
    "the algebra does not close on a finite number of bose sea - levels for the superconformal ghosts .",
    "what we have done so far is just recall how to get the space - time supersymmetry in the nsr description of @xmath301 .",
    "now we wish to show that there exists a simpler formulation that results in the space - time supersymmetry . in doing so",
    ", we must bear in mind that the bosonic @xmath302 wzw model is bosonized by the wakimoto and vertex operator constructions as given by and .",
    "then the @xmath1 superconformal generators are simply given by !",
    "thus , we do not need the @xmath30 superconformal algebra anymore .",
    "moreover , we get a manifest supersymmetry which is due to the fermions @xmath304 hidden by such bosonization .",
    "both of these features are typical for the gs formulation .",
    "can we interpret this construction as a hybrid of the nsr and gs formulations ?",
    "we can not rule out this hypothesis because it is well - known that @xmath305 is a delicate case from the conformal field theory point of view .",
    "so , something special may happen .",
    "first let us say a few words about the results .    in this work",
    "we have built the unitary representations of the affine lie algebras a , d , e type as well as the massless representations of the @xmath1 superconformal algebra that is a natural continuation of what we did in our previous work .",
    "it is found that the postulates ( i)-(iii ) , as these are formulated in the introduction , are not only useful for string propagation on @xmath0 , but are in fact crucial to get new constructions . indeed , using the green s idea `` world - sheets for world - sheets '' results in new free field representations of affine lie algebras that contain fewer free fields than the corresponding wakimoto representations have .",
    "the same is also true for the @xmath1 superconformal algebra .",
    "it opens new possibilities in studying infinite dimensional lie algebras .",
    "moreover , we have presented the hints in favor of the existence of a new construction ( hybrid ) for string propagation on @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that further work is needed to make this more rigorous .",
    "so , let us conclude by mentioning a few problems that are seemed the most important to us .",
    "\\(i ) of course , the most important open problem is to understand how to incorporate the massive representations of the @xmath1 superconformal algebra into our construction . as we noted in subsection 4.1 , these representations exhibit a continuum in the spectrum of the conformal dimensions .",
    "this is exactly the reason why our construction fails .",
    "however , there exists a deeper problem . up to now",
    "it is not known what the op algebra and correlation functions of the @xmath1 cft are .",
    "\\(ii ) the new construction proposed in section 3 to get the free field representations of affine lie algebras of the a , d , e , type requires much work in the future to reach such mathematical understanding as we have for the vertex operator construction and the wakimoto free field representation .",
    "our analysis of section 3 is essentially a physical one .",
    "\\(iii ) finally , the problem that obviously deserves more attention is the hypothesis about a hybrid of the nsr and gs formulations for string theory on @xmath0 .",
    "here we need a fuller understanding of the problem on the level of a proper polyakov path integral .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank b. feigin and r. metsaev for many stimulating discussions , and a. semikhatov for reading the manuscript and a very useful discussion .",
