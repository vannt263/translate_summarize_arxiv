    "the primary aim of this work is to model inelastic scattering quantitatively using a generalization of the real space multiple scattering ( rsms ) approach .",

    "green s function method has been extensively developed for calculations of x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) and related spectroscopies @xcite .",
    "thus the approach permits calculations of inelastic scattering in arbitrary aperiodic materials over a broad energy range , including the near edge and extended fine structure . in inelastic scattering experiments ,",
    "the scattering cross section is measured as a function of the energy @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 transfered from the probe to the system ( throughout this paper we use hartree atomic units , @xmath2 ) . when the energy transfer is close to the binding energy of a core state , the inelastic scattering cross - section exhibits pronounced jumps , from which one can study the core - excited states of the system .",
    "we focus in this paper on the excitations from such core levels .    in the low momentum transfer regime",
    "the scattering cross section is dominated by the dipole allowed excitations .",
    "qualitatively the dipole approximation is valid when @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mean radius of the core state , @xmath5 being the effective core charge . in the dipole",
    "limit the inelastic scattering cross section is proportional to the x - ray absorption coefficient  @xcite , and the direction @xmath6 of the momentum transfer vector plays the role of the xas polarization vector @xmath7 .",
    "thus the anisotropy of the x - ray edge can be studied by varying @xmath6 in much the same way it is studied in xas by varying the direction of @xmath8 . however , as the magnitude of @xmath9 increases , contributions from other ( dipole forbidden ) excitation channels become important .",
    "the symmetries of a system generally restrict the available excitation channels at a given excitation energy .",
    "the relative weights of the various excitation channels , as a function of momentum transfer , also depend on the spatial extent of the excited state .",
    "in general the classification of the spectral features into given spatial symmetries of the final state electron ( i.e. @xmath10-type , @xmath11-type etc . ) is not as straightforward as in xas .",
    "this is because contributions to the spectra from different excitations often overlap at finite momentum transfer .",
    "due to this overlap , a detailed analysis of experimental results can be difficult in the absence of quantitative theoretical calculations .",
    "there are some exceptions though ; core - excitons can have well defined spatial symmetry and energies well separated from other excitations .",
    "non - resonant inelastic scattering spectra can be measured using either electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels )  @xcite or non - resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( nrixs )  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections in both cases are related to the dynamic structure factor @xmath12 of a system .",
    "for the case of x - rays , the non - relativistic born approximation for the nrixs double differential cross - section is  @xcite @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the thomson scattering cross - section .",
    "the thomson cross section can be expressed in terms of the incoming ( scattered ) photon polarization vector and energy @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the classical electron radius . in eq .",
    "( [ nrixs ] ) we have implicitly assumed that the energy of the incident x - ray is not close to any core binding energy @xmath19 ( typically @xmath20 ) .",
    "this is in contrast with resonant inelastic x - ray scattering experiments where the incident x - ray energy is tuned close to a core binding energy and resonant processes dominate the double differential cross section .",
    "the different forms of inelastic x - ray scattering and their relationships are discussed in more detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . in eels",
    "the corresponding scattering cross section in the born approximation is  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the electron - electron scattering cross - section with @xmath11 ( @xmath23 ) being the momentum of the incoming ( scattered ) electron . in other words , with these approximations the cross - sections differ only by a coupling constant which is related to the probe ( i.e. , a photon or electron ) that interacts with the system .",
    "the system dependent part , namely the dynamic structure factor @xmath24 , is the same for both nrixs and eels , and depends only on the structure and excited state properties of the system under investigation .",
    "non - resonant inelastic x - ray scattering from core - excited states is often called x - ray raman scattering ( xrs ) .",
    "traditionally xrs experiments have been limited to @xmath25-edges of low-@xmath26 materials . however , for the @xmath25-edges , experimentally accessible systems include such important cases as those with carbon and oxygen , as has already been demonstrated ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently xrs experiments were done for the @xmath27-edges and @xmath28-edges of materials with higher @xmath26 including n - edge of ba in ba@xmath29si@xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the smallness of the x - ray scattering cross - section implies that bulk information is generally obtained in these probes , i.e. , that multiple scattering of the probe particles and surface effects are usually not serious problems .",
    "xrs has been used to study both the momentum transfer magnitude  @xcite and direction dependence  @xcite at @xmath25-edges .",
    "recently the @xmath25-edge of be metal was studied using both degrees of freedom ( magnitude and direction )  @xcite .",
    "the typical energy resolution of current xrs experiments is around 1.0  ev fwhm , although some experiments with a energy resolution of 0.4  ev have been carried out  @xcite .",
    "the finite core - hole lifetime broadening also limits the useful energy resolution to a few tenths of an ev .    as noted above",
    ", one can also measure the fine structure of the spectra above deep core edges using electrons as a probe . unlike non - resonant x - ray scattering",
    ", eels is not limited to low-@xmath26 materials , and has a typical energy resolution on the order of 0.1 ev .",
    "electrons interact strongly with solids , so that one is often able to obtain results with good statistical accuracy .",
    "however , their strong interaction also implies that multiple scattering of the probe electrons can be a problem which has to be removed or otherwise accounted for in the analysis of experimental results .",
    "this is especially true of experiments with large scattering angles or low incident electron energies , in which case one should explicitly include multiple scattering in the analysis , as explained in ref .",
    "the dependence of x - ray edges on the magnitude of the momentum transfer has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and more recently in ref .",
    "the dependence on the momentum transfer direction at x - ray edges has also been used in the analysis of anisotropy of x - ray edges ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "additionally the very high spatial resolution available in eels makes it possible to study the anisotropy of x - ray edges in fine - grained solids  @xcite .",
    "theoretically the problem of calculating inelastic scattering spectra from core - excited states is analogous to the calculation of core level x - ray absorption , the main difference being in the nature of the transition matrix elements .",
    "thus there are number of effects that must be taken into account for accurate computational results . within the independent electron approximation ,",
    "the main problem is the behavior of the core - excited final states .",
    "this can be approached either by calculating the core - excited states one by one ( e.g. , in band - structure or molecular - orbital based approaches ) or equivalently , by calculating the one - electron green s function for the excited states , as is done in this work . for accurate results one needs a highly quantitative method for calculating single - particle properties such as electron densities and coulomb potentials .",
    "also a number of many - body properties of the excited states of the system have to be considered .",
    "these include the interaction of the final state electron with the core - hole created in the excitation process , as well as an approximation for the energy - dependent self - energies @xmath31 of both the electron and the core - hole , e.g. to account for inelastic losses .",
    "a good approximation in many cases is to calculate the final state in the presence of the core hole and the initial state with ground state potentials @xcite .",
    "this approximation is referred to as the _ final state rule_. in principle one should include the whole energy dependence of the self - energy , as discussed for example in ref .",
    "however , often a quasiparticle approximation is used both for the electron and the core - hole . in the quasiparticle approximation , the imaginary part of the self - energy causes the electron ( and the hole ) in the excited state to have a finite lifetime .",
    "additionally the real - part of the self - energy shifts the spectral features from the positions predicted by ground - state ( or mean - field ) approximations , whereas traditional ground state density functional treatments can lead to significant errors in peak positions and intensities . for a full treatment , especially at high energies ,",
    "one also needs to consider coupling to vibrational degrees of freedom , which give the spectra a temperature dependent damping comparable to that of x - ray debye - waller factors .",
    "a more detailed review of the problem of computing core - excited states in xas can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . as noted above the main difference between inelastic scattering and x - ray absorption lies in the transition matrix elements .",
    "this is due to the fact that the operator mediating the transitions in inelastic scattering is @xmath32 , as compared to the dipole operator @xmath33 ( and , in some cases , also the quadrupole operator ) in x - ray absorption .",
    "we will discuss this difference in more detail below .    in this article",
    "we have applied the real - space multiple - scattering ( rsms ) approach to calculate the core - excited states in eels and nrixs over a wide energy range .",
    "the rsms approach adopted here , is essentially an effective , independent particle approach for excited states which takes into account the most important final state effects .",
    "the approach is an extension of the rsms approach previously used for x - ray absorption spectra  @xcite .",
    "the momentum transfer dependence of both the near edge spectra and the fine structure in inelastic loss spectra are analyzed in detail and compared with experimental results .",
    "recently a two - particle approach to core - excited states has been developed  @xcite based on the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "the bse goes beyond the independent particle approximation with an explicit treatment of the screened electron core - hole interaction .",
    "however , when the core - hole interaction is strong , the results from the final state rule can be comparable @xcite .",
    "the bse approach has been applied to different situations using the momentum transfer dependent matrix elements in the analysis of xrs  @xcite . for completeness our calculations",
    "are also compared with calculations based on the bse .",
    "however , the bse approach is currently applicable only relatively close to a given edge , typically between a few tens and 100 ev depending on the material , and becomes computationally impractical for treating the extended fine structure in inelastic scattering spectra .",
    "we now briefly describe the extension of the real - space multiple - scattering approach for calculations of non - resonant inelastic scattering .",
    "the rsms approach can be regarded as the real space analog of the kkr band structure method @xcite , but unlike kkr , the method makes no assumption of symmetry and is applicable to periodic and aperiodic systems alike .",
    "moreover , the implementation used here is an _ all - electron _ approach which can be applied to arbitrary systems throughout the periodic table .",
    "this method has been extensively developed for _ ab initio _ calculations of x - ray spectra including both exafs ( extended x - ray absorption fine structure ) and xanes ( x - ray absorption near edge structure ) @xcite .",
    "its generalization here to finite momentum transfer @xmath34 is relatively straightforward , though non - trivial in several respects , as discussed below .",
    "the contributions to @xmath12 from excitations from a tightly bound core state @xmath35 can be approximated using fermi s golden rule , i.e. , @xmath36 where @xmath19 ( @xmath37 ) is the initial ( final ) state quasiparticle energy of the electron .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we will drop the index @xmath38 and use simply @xmath12 when referring to the contribution from a core state @xmath35 . within the one - electron approximation and the final state rule ,",
    "the final ( photo - electron ) states @xmath39 are quasi - particle states which are eigenfunctions of the final state hamiltonian in the presence of an adiabatically screened core hole ( denoted with a prime ) , i.e. , @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath31 is the self - energy ( or dynamically screened exchange - correlation potential ) which accounts for inelastic losses , which are essential for a proper treatment of inelastic electron scattering . in our calculations we use the energy dependent local density approximation for @xmath31 of hedin and lundqvist  @xcite , based on the plasmon - pole approximation for the dielectric function .",
    "this approximation is usually adequate at moderate to high photoelectron energies @xcite .",
    "the states @xmath41 are deep - core levels of the initial state hamiltonian without a core - hole . for small momentum transfers in the case of core - excited states ,",
    "the excitation operator @xmath42 can be expanded as @xmath43 thus the dipole selection rule is approximately valid at small @xmath9 , since the first term should not contribute to transitions due to orthogonality of the initial and final states , and the next term ( @xmath44 ) is also small .",
    "in fact since @xmath0 and @xmath34 can , in principle , be chosen separately , the dipole approximation can sometimes be satisfied better in inelastic scattering than in absorption , where the photon momentum and energy are always linked . at higher",
    "@xmath9 , dipole forbidden transitions become important , and it is more convenient to expand the exponential in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath45 thus for any finite momentum transfer all excitation channels are present .    to avoid explicit calculations of final states",
    "it is advantageous to re - express the golden rule in terms of the one - particle green s function or propagator @xmath46^{-1}$ ] in real space , where @xmath47 is the core - hole lifetime . thus using the spectral representation ,",
    "@xmath48 the dynamic structure factor becomes @xmath49 where the photoelectron energy is @xmath50 .",
    "the operator @xmath51 projects the green s function on to the unoccupied states of the initial state ( without the core hole ) hamiltonian  @xcite . the operator @xmath51 is needed here since , in general , the eigenstates of the final state hamiltonian are not strictly orthogonal to the initial state of the scattering . in practice",
    "this non - orthogonality implies that at low momentum transfer @xmath52 thus the dipole forbidden excitations , which incorrectly vary as @xmath53 , can begin to dominate over the dipole allowed transitions @xmath54 as @xmath55 .",
    "the application of the full projection operator @xmath51 would require taking an inner - product and appropriate matrix elements of all the occupied states @xmath56 of the initial state hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath57 instead we simply approximate the effect of @xmath51 by modifying the excitation operator as @xmath58   | i \\rangle.\\ ] ] clearly at low momentum transfers this gives matrix elements @xmath59 while at high momentum transfers the correction @xmath60 , it is included in the actual calculations .",
    "the terms coming from the difference of @xmath51 and @xmath61 are neglected .",
    "although this is a somewhat uncontrolled approximation , comparison with experiments and previous xrs calculations at different momentum transfers show that these terms should be small , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ evsf ] below .",
    "also work in xas suggests that the difference not significant compared with other theoretical uncertainties @xcite .    in multiple scattering ( ms )",
    "theory , the scattering perturbation is the total electron potential , which is separated into contributions from  scattering potentials \" @xmath62 which are localized on each atomic site @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath64 in the rsms method @xmath65 is usually taken to be spherically symmetric .",
    "this is a good approximation for electron scattering calculations at moderate electron kinetic energies , i.e. , a few ev above the threshold .",
    "these potentials are calculated self - consistently by iterating the total electron density , potential and fermi - energy , typically requiring about 10 - 20 iterations .",
    "once the potentials are known , scattering phase shifts @xmath66 are calculated and dimensionless @xmath67-matrices evaluated using the relation @xmath68 . with",
    "spherically symmetric potentials , the propagator @xmath69 ( and hence the density matrix @xmath70 ) can be represented in an angular - momentum @xmath71 and site @xmath72 basis @xmath73 .",
    "thus at the site of the core - excited atom ( @xmath74 ) @xmath75 where @xmath76 are scattering states at energy @xmath77 , which are regular at the origin .",
    "the expansion for @xmath78 and @xmath79 about different sites @xmath72 and @xmath80 is similar , with @xmath81 replaced by @xmath82 .",
    "consequently the calculation of the dynamic structure factor is reduced to a calculation of ( embedded ) atomic transition matrix elements @xmath83 and a multiple - scattering matrix @xmath84 , i.e. ,  @xcite @xmath85 here @xmath86 denote matrix elements of the final state density matrix , including the effect of the core - hole potential .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath24 also satisfies a generalized oscillator strength sum - rule . the representation in eq .",
    "( [ offdiagrep ] ) shows that the essential physics of the problem separates into two parts : i ) a @xmath34 dependent transition matrix which governs the production of photoelectrons into various final states , and ii ) a propagator matrix @xmath87 which describes the scattering of the photoelectron within the system at a given excitation energy .",
    "the transition matrix elements @xmath88 are calculated using the expansion in eq .",
    "( 5 ) of @xmath42 in terms of spherical harmonics .",
    "depending on the excitation energy and momentum transfer , different terms @xmath27 in this expansion are important . for low momentum transfer and excitation energy",
    "the small @xmath89 transitions are most important , starting from the dipole @xmath90 , monopole @xmath91 , and quadrupole @xmath92 transitions .",
    "thus provided one can neglect the coupling to phonons ( which is a good approximation for core excitations discussed in this work ) , a typical spectrum at low @xmath9 can be analyzed using only these three excitation channels .",
    "monopole transitions , which are present in @xmath24 through the term @xmath93 , have no counter - part in absorption ( @xmath10-to-@xmath10 transitions being forbidden within the dipole approximation ) .",
    "when the momentum transfer is increased in inelastic scattering , other excitation channels become more important , especially at high energy values .",
    "the above rsms formulation can be advantageous even for crystals , since periodicity is broken by the core - hole interaction and spectral broadening from the core - hole lifetime and the self energy .",
    "typically @xmath94 is several ev at photoelectron energies above about 30 ev of an edge .",
    "this broadening limits the range probed by the photoelectron to clusters of order a few hundred atoms , and gives rise to a _ short range order _ theory for energies above about 30 ev . thus long range effects such as the sharp van hove singularities of band structure calculations are naturally smeared out . moreover , in this extended energy regime scattering is relatively weak and perturbation theory converges well .",
    "conversely , in the near edge regime ( energies less than about 30 ev ) , the range is dominated mostly by the core lifetime @xmath95 which is very long for low @xmath26 materials or for very shallow edges . for those cases",
    "an intermediate- or long - range order theory may be needed , involving multiple - scattering to all orders or very large cluster of atoms .",

    "the coupling terms @xmath99 are essentially atomic quantities which can be calculated theoretically to good accuracy",
    ". thus it may be possible to extract the ldos @xmath100 or the density matrix components @xmath101 from a sequence of experimental measurements of @xmath12 at various @xmath34 by a suitable inversion procedure of eq .",

    "the momentum transfer dependence of these two contributions to the dynamic structure factor can be analyzed separately as shown in detail below .",
    "much of the qualitative behavior of the spectra can be understood in terms of the central atom contribution ( in the absence of other scatterers ) , which has been analyzed for isolated atoms by , e.g. , leapman et al .",

    "@xcite . from this comparison",
    "it is clear that our present calculation is capable of reproducing both the momentum transfer direction and magnitude dependence of the dynamic structure factor .",
    "however , there are noticeable discrepancies in some fine details in the spectra within the first 15 ev . for the momentum transfer perpendicular to the @xmath191-axis",
    ", the 120 ev features are more pronounced in the rsms calculation than in the experiment for both the low- and high momentum - transfer .",
    "however , the main differences between these spectra is well reproduced by present calculation . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ evsf ] we show for comparison the results from the bse method  @xcite . considering how sensitive the problem of calculating core - excitation is , the agreement between the two different theoretical methods is rather good .",
    "this serves to validate the one - electron , final state rule calculations , at least for this case .",
    "as noted above , most of the differences occur rather close to the edge , which is also the region most sensitive to the details of the core hole - electron interaction and to the nature of the scattering potentials . beyond the first 15  ev the agreement between the two methods",
    "is very good .",
    "for @xmath34 along the @xmath191-axis , agreement between the two calculations is also rather good for the energy range shown . for @xmath34",
    "perpendicular to the @xmath191-axis , however , the comparison is somewhat mixed .",
    "for the first peak in the spectra it appears that rsms accurately predicts the experimental result .",
    "the difference is that the first peak becomes a shoulder at low momentum transfer and a peak at higher momentum transfer . on the other hand the details of the spectra between 120 - 130  ev",
    "appear to be slightly better reproduced by the bse .     along the @xmath192-axis .",

    "the calculated spectra are shifted so that the fermi - energy is aligned with that obtained in the ldos calculation , where @xmath194 is the vacuum level . on this scale the fermi energy for",
    "be as calculated by our rsms code is @xmath195 ev . the @xmath11-type ldos close to the fermi energy is composed of two peaks at @xmath196 ev and @xmath197 ev and a broad shoulder at @xmath198 ev . in the small momentum transfer regime",

    "compared to the low @xmath9 spectrum , the high momentum transfer spectrum has sharp peaks at these same energies .",
    "the coincidence of the peaks is due to hybridization between the various angular momentum components .",
    "clearly the changes in the near edge structure with increasing @xmath9 can be attributed partly to the increasing contribution from the @xmath10-to-@xmath10 type transitions .",
    "also the changes due to the matrix elements that weight the different excitations have to be considered when comparing ldos to experimental spectra .",
    "this can clearly be seen when comparing low momentum transfer spectra along either the @xmath192- or @xmath191-axes .",
    "although both exhibit a @xmath11-type ldos structure , the weights of the different features are strongly dependent on the magnitude and direction of the momentum transfer .",

    "the @xmath10-to-@xmath193 contribution is small at low energies but becomes increasingly important as the energy is increased , again reflecting the energy dependent weight of different excitation channels .",
    "a.u .  along the @xmath191-axis . ]    the total spectrum changes also as function of the magnitude of the momentum transfer because of the changes in the channel specific spectra .",
    "this change is due to the excitation energy @xmath77 dependence of the final state partial wave @xmath76 .",

    "the inelastic scattering spectra was slightly shifted vertically .",

    "are compared in fig .",
    "[ alexafs ] . to make contact with @xmath12",
    "the absorption cross - section @xmath204 was divided by the excitation energy , since in the limit @xmath205 , @xcite @xmath206 comparison of @xmath207 and @xmath12 for @xmath208 a.u.clearly shows the well known and experimentally verified  @xcite fact that inelastic scattering results at low momentum transfer can be used to obtain the same exafs information as in xas .",
    "since we are interested in discussing the general trends of the momentum transfer dependence of @xmath209 in the extended energy range we have not included the al @xmath210-edge ( edge located at about 80  ev ) to this theoretical demonstration . for comparison with",
    "momentum transfer dependent experiments for this energy range ( we are not aware of such experiments in any material ) one would need to include these edges .",
    "as @xmath9 is increased to @xmath211 and @xmath212 a.u . , the overall shape of the spectra changes . as mentioned above , this change is mostly due to changes in the central atom contribution .",
    "although the exafs - like oscillations appear to diminish with higher momentum transfer , most of the broad oscillatory structure remains .     for al at the @xmath201 edge for different values of momentum transfer",
    "as listed in the figure labels , together with the x - ray absorption fine structure @xmath213 , i.e. , @xmath203 .",
    "the curves are shifted for clarity . ]    in fig .",
    "[ alchiq ] we examine the momentum transfer dependence of the @xmath34-dependent fine structure @xmath214 . here",
    "we show the xas fine structure @xmath213 , together with @xmath214 for several values of @xmath9 at the al @xmath201-edge .",
    "again it is clear that for low @xmath9 the xas result is reproduced .",
    "when the momentum transfer is increased , however , the shape of the fine structure of the spectra is modified in a way that can not be explained by simple scaling factors , due to the mixture between the various angular momentum contributions .",
    "the changes are perhaps strongest close to the edge ( at small @xmath187 ) , but even the high @xmath187 spectra is modified .",
    "this suggests that it may be desirable to decompose the spectra into the various angular momentum components @xmath215 prior to additional analysis .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ alexafsft ] , which shows the fourier transform of the exafs @xmath216 in @xmath217-space , phase corrected by the dominant central atom @xmath11-wave phase shift @xmath218 .",
    "such fourier transforms have peaks close to the near - neighbor distances and provide a characterization of the near neighbor radial structure .",
    "thus they can be used for quantitative fits of exafs in @xmath217-space .",
    "note that for small @xmath9 the transform is insensitive to @xmath9 but becomes substantially more complex for the larger values due to the overlapping contributions from the various channels .",
    "we have shown how the real - space multiple - scattering ( rsms ) approach can be applied to model non - resonant inelastic scattering from deep core levels for arbitrary condensed systems over a broad spectral range .",
    "the approach is a generalization to finite momentum transfer of that used to model xas based on the independent electron approximation and the final state rule .",
    "in contrast to xas where dipole selection rules apply , couplings to all angular momentum components are important and hence can probe different symmetries of the excited states .",
    "comparison of our approach with earlier work  @xcite based on the particle - hole bse generally gives good agreement between these two methods .",
    "this suggests that an effective one - electron treatment that includes the core - hole via the final state rule may be adequate for calculations of inelastic scattering in addition to xas . we have also discussed how the results may be used to analyze the inelastic x - ray ( xrs ) or electron scattering ( eels ) from core electrons .",
    "in particular we discussed the relation between these spectra and the angular momentum projected density of states ( e.g. , @xmath10-type and @xmath11-type ldos ) and density matrix components @xmath101 , and how these can be extracted from a series of experimental measurements .",
    "our calculated spectra are compared with the experimental xrs results  @xcite for the case of the be @xmath25-edge , and gives good agreement over a wide energy range , both for the directional and magnitude dependence of the momentum transfer .",
    "in addition we have shown that the calculations reproduce the well known and demonstrated relationship between xas and non - resonant inelastic scattering at low momentum transfers , i.e. , the dipole limit @xmath219 .",
    "an explicit example is given for the case of the al @xmath201-edge .",
    "finally we have also discussed the momentum transfer dependence of the fine structure @xmath107 in the exafs region , and suggested how this might be exploited in structural studies .",
