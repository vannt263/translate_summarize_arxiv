    "during the 1996 and 1997 data taking periods , the centre - of - mass energy , @xmath4 , of the @xmath0 collider lep at cern was increased from @xmath2 to @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "these energies are well above the kinematic threshold of w - boson pair production , @xmath6 .    w - pair production , single - w production ( @xmath7 ) and single - photon production ( @xmath8 ) all depend on the trilinear self couplings among the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath9 , w and z  @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian gauge structure of the electroweak theory implies the existence of the triple - gauge - boson vertices @xmath9ww and zww  @xcite .",
    "to lowest order within the standard model  @xcite ( sm ) , three feynman diagrams contribute to w - pair production , the @xmath10-channel @xmath9 and z - boson exchange and the @xmath11-channel @xmath12 exchange .",
    "the @xmath10-channel diagrams contain the @xmath9ww and zww vertices . at present centre - of - mass energies ,",
    "single - w production is sensitive to the electromagnetic gauge couplings only .",
    "the @xmath9ww vertex appears in one of the contributing @xmath11-channel feynman diagrams in @xmath13 production , and dominates the corresponding diagram containing the zww vertex .",
    "radiation of a photon from the @xmath11-channel exchanged w boson in the process @xmath14 becomes significant for centre - of - mass energies far above the z pole and involves as well the @xmath9ww vertex .",
    "in general the vertices @xmath9ww and zww are parametrised in terms of seven triple - gauge - boson couplings ( tgcs ) each  @xcite , too many to be measured simultaneously . regarding only cp - conserving couplings and assuming electromagnetic gauge invariance , six tgcs remain , which are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . within the sm , @xmath21 and @xmath22 at tree level . except @xmath16",
    "these tgcs also conserve c and p separately .    assuming custodial @xmath23 symmetry leads to the constraints @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite , where @xmath26 denotes the deviation of the tgc from its sm value and @xmath27 is the weak mixing angle .",
    "when these constraints are applied , the remaining three tgcs , @xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , correspond to the operators in a linear realization of a gauge - invariant effective lagrangian that do not affect the gauge - boson propagators at tree level  @xcite .",
    "the tgcs are related to the three @xmath28 couplings used in our previous publications  @xcite . , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "]    alternatively , it is interesting to study the tgcs @xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 , imposing @xmath31 .",
    "this set corresponds to the operators of lowest dimensionality in the non - linear realization of a gauge - invariant effective lagrangian , necessary in the absence of a light higgs boson  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we report on measurements of tgcs of the w boson in data samples corresponding to total luminosities of 10.9  pb@xmath1 , 10.3  pb@xmath1 and 55.5  pb@xmath1 collected at centre - of - mass energies of @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the results on tgcs are based on analyses of multi - differential cross sections in w - pair , single - w and single - photon production .",
    "they include and supersede our previously published results on tgcs  @xcite .",
    "other experiments at lep and at hadron colliders have also reported results on tgcs  @xcite .",
    "the event selections used here are identical to those published earlier on w - pair production  @xcite , single - w production  @xcite , and single - photon production  @xcite . the same signal and background monte carlo and detector simulations are used .",
    "the number of selected events and the expected background are reported in table  [ tab : events - all ] .",
    "each w boson decays into a fermion and an antifermion , for short denoted as @xmath32 or @xmath33 in the following .",
    "the visible particles in the final state , , electrons , muons , @xmath34 jets corresponding to the visible @xmath34 decay products , and hadronic jets corresponding to quarks are reconstructed  @xcite . for @xmath35 and @xmath36 events , energy - momentum conservation and equal mass for the two w bosons",
    "are used as constraints in a kinematic fit to determine the kinematics of all four final - state fermions with improved resolution  @xcite .    in the case of @xmath35 events ,",
    "a combinatorial ambiguity arises in the assignment of jets to w bosons .",
    "the four jets are paired to two w bosons following the criterion of smallest mass difference between the w candidates , excluding the combination with the smallest sum of w masses .",
    "on monte carlo events , the resulting pairing is found to be correct for 74% of all selected @xmath35 events at @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "summing over final - state fermion helicities , fixing the mass of the w boson and neglecting photon radiation , five phase - space angles completely describe the four - fermion final state from w - pair decay for unpolarised initial states .",
    "these are the polar scattering angle of the w@xmath38 boson , @xmath39 , and the polar and azimuthal decay angles in the rest systems of the two decaying w bosons , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , for the fermion in w@xmath38 and the antifermion in w@xmath42 decay .",
    "tgcs affect the total production cross section , the distribution of the w - boson polar scattering angle , and the polarisations of the two w bosons , analysed in the distributions of the w decay angles .    for the @xmath2 w - pair data",
    ", only the total w - pair cross section is used  @xcite , while at higher centre - of - mass energies also distributions in phase - space angles are analysed . for charged leptons , the sign of their electric charge determines whether they are fermions or antifermions . for hadronic jets ,",
    "the flavour and charge of the original quark is not measured .",
    "thus , a two - fold ambiguity arises in the decay angles of hadronically decaying w bosons . in @xmath35 events",
    "the charges of the two pairs of jets are evaluated , based on a jet - charge technique  @xcite , to assign positive and negative charge to the reconstructed w bosons . for events with correctly paired jets ,",
    "the w charge assignment is found to be correct in 69% of all selected @xmath35 events at @xmath43 .",
    "the distribution of the w@xmath38 polar scattering angle , @xmath39 , shown in figure  [ fig : wwctw]a , and the total cross section are used for the determination of tgcs .    in @xmath36 events",
    "the w charge assignment is given by the charge of the lepton .",
    "the total cross section and the threefold differential distribution in the w@xmath38 polar scattering angle , @xmath39 , and the two decay angles of the leptonically decaying w boson , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , are used for the determination of tgcs .",
    "the corresponding three one - dimensional projections are shown in figures  [ fig : wwctw]b and  [ fig : wwstar ] .    in @xmath46 events two",
    "unmeasured neutrinos are present . knowing the momentum and charge of both charged leptons , it is possible to calculate the polar scattering angle of the w@xmath38 boson up to a twofold ambiguity arising from the solutions of a quadratic equation .",
    "this requires imposing energy - momentum conservation , fixing the masses of the two w bosons to @xmath47  @xcite , and neglecting photon radiation .",
    "both solutions are considered , each weighted by a factor of 0.5 . in two cases the true w polar angle",
    "is not reconstructed : ( 1 ) if one or both of the leptons is a @xmath34 , the visible lepton energy entering the calculation is not the energy of the produced @xmath34 lepton ; ( 2 ) if the two solutions are complex , which occurs in 23% of the selected @xmath46 events , their imaginary parts are dropped .",
    "however , the distributions still show sensitivity to tgcs .",
    "the distribution of the polar scattering angle , @xmath39 , shown in figure  [ fig : wwctw]c , and the total cross section are used for the determination of tgcs .",
    "if in the process @xmath7 the final state electron is scattered at low polar angles , it escapes detection along the beam pipe . only the decay products of a single w boson are observed .",
    "leptonic single - w events , where the w boson decays into a lepton - neutrino pair , are selected by requiring a single charged lepton , either electron , muon or @xmath34 jet , without any other activity in the detector  @xcite .",
    "only the total cross section is used in the determination of tgcs .",
    "hadronic single - w events , where the w boson decays into a quark pair , are selected with a neural network approach  @xcite . after a preselection ,",
    "several kinematic variables are fed into a neural network trained to separate the hadronic single - w events from the dominating background of @xmath36 w - pair events . the total cross section and the distribution of the neural - network output variable",
    "are used in the determination of tgcs .",
    "about a third of the hadronic single - w events are also selected by the @xmath36 w - pair selections , see table  [ tab : events - sub ] , mainly @xmath48 events . in order to avoid double counting ,",
    "such events are considered in the w - pair sample only .",
    "this reduces the sensitivity of the single - w sample to tgcs as compared to the sensitivity obtained in our published single - w tgc analysis  @xcite .",
    "however , in combination with the w - pair signal the overall sensitivity is expected to be better than that achieved when removing the duplicate events from the @xmath36 w - pair samples .",
    "the resulting distribution of the output of the neural network is shown in figure  [ fig:1w ] .",
    "single - photon events are selected by requiring one energy deposition above @xmath49 inside a polar angular range from 14@xmath50 to 166@xmath50 in the electromagnetic calorimeter with an electromagnetic shower shape and without any other activity in the detector  @xcite .",
    "because of azimuthal symmetry , there are two relevant observables for single - photon events , the energy and the polar angle of the single photon .",
    "the total cross section and the shape of the twofold differential distribution in these two observables are used in the determination of tgcs .",
    "the corresponding two one - dimensional projections are shown in figure  [ fig:1 g ] .",
    "the main sensitivity of single - photon events to tgcs occurs at high photon energies above those corresponding to the radiative return to the z.",
    "the fitting procedure uses the maximum likelihood method to extract values and errors for one or more of the tgcs denoted as @xmath51 for short in the following .",
    "it is similar to the fitting procedure used in our analysis for the mass and width of the w boson  @xcite .    for each data event",
    ", the fit considers the set of values of the reconstructed observables , @xmath52 , as discussed in sections  [ sec : ww ] , [ sec:1w ] and  [ sec:1 g ] .",
    "the likelihood is the product of the normalised differential cross section , @xmath53 , for all data events , calculated as a function of the tgcs @xmath51 to be fitted . for a given final state @xmath54",
    ", one has : @xmath55 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the accepted signal and background cross sections . for the background which is independent of the tgcs @xmath51",
    ", the total and differential cross sections are taken from monte carlo simulations .    for values @xmath58 varied during the fitting procedure ,",
    "the @xmath51-dependent total and differential signal and background cross sections are determined by a reweighting procedure applied to monte carlo events originally generated with tgc values @xmath59 .",
    "the event weights @xmath60 are calculated as the ratio : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the matrix element of the considered final state @xmath54 evaluated for the generated four - momenta @xmath63 including radiated photons . for w - pair and single - w events the matrix elements as implemented in the excalibur  @xcite event generator are used , which include all relevant tree - level feynman diagrams contributing to a given four - fermion final state .",
    "the reweighting procedure is checked by comparisons with gentle  @xcite and grc4f  @xcite cross section predictions , especially important in the case of single - w production as grc4f includes the effects of fermion masses . in the case of single - photon production the matrix element as implemented in koralz  @xcite is used .",
    "the reweighting procedure is tested by comparing reweighted distributions to distributions generated with nngpv  @xcite at various values of tgcs . in all cases good agreement is observed .",
    "the total accepted cross section for a given set of parameters @xmath58 is then : @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the cross section corresponding to the total monte carlo sample containing @xmath66 events .",
    "the sum extends over all accepted monte carlo events @xmath67 .",
    "the accepted differential cross section in reconstructed quantities @xmath68 is determined by averaging monte carlo events inside a box in @xmath68 around each data event@xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the volume of the box and the sum extends over all accepted monte carlo events @xmath67 inside the box .",
    "this takes @xmath68-dependent detector effects and @xmath51-dependent efficiencies and purities properly into account .",
    "the boxes are constructed in such a way that the monte carlo events in the box are the 200 events closest to the data point .",
    "the box size in each of the observables is proportional to the experimental resolution in those variables .",
    "extended maximum likelihood fits are performed , including the overall normalisations according to the measured total cross sections .",
    "the likelihood is multiplied by the poissonian probability to obtain the numbers of events observed in the data , given the luminosity and the expectations for the accepted signal and background cross sections , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the fitting method described above determines the tgcs without any bias as long as the monte carlo describes photon radiation and detector effects such as resolution and acceptance functions correctly . by fitting large monte carlo samples , typically a hundred times the data , the fitting procedure is tested to high accuracy .",
    "the fits reproduce well the values of the tgcs of the large monte carlo samples being fitted , varied in a range corresponding to three times the error expected for the size of the data samples analysed . also , the fit results do not depend on the values of the tgcs @xmath59 of the monte carlo sample subjected to the reweighting procedure .",
    "the reliability of the statistical errors as given by the fit is tested by fitting for each final state several hundred small monte carlo samples , each the size of the data samples .",
    "the width of the distribution of the fitted central values agrees well with the mean of the distribution of the fitted errors .",
    "in w - pair , single - w and single - photon production , the triple - gauge - boson vertices are tested at different momentum - transfer scales @xmath73 . for each tgc investigated , the results derived at @xmath74 from w - pair production , at @xmath75 from single - w production , and at @xmath76 from single - photon production are in good agreement with each other , as shown in table  [ tab : ac - res-1 ] and figure  [ fig : ac-1dlnl ] .",
    "no @xmath73 dependence is observed .",
    "combined results , obtained by adding the individual log - likelihood functions as shown in figure  [ fig : ac-1dlnl ] , are reported in tables  [ tab : ac - res-1 ] and  [ tab : ac - res-2 ] . compared to the current level of statistical accuracy ,",
    "the @xmath73 dependence of the tgcs expected in the sm is negligible  @xcite and is thus ignored in the combination . as a cross check ,",
    "the method of optimal observables  @xcite is used in the case of @xmath36 w - pair events at @xmath77 .",
    "compatible results are obtained .",
    "the statistical errors on tgcs observed in w - pair production are larger than the expected statistical errors which are also reported in table  [ tab : ac - res-1 ] .",
    "the large total cross section measured in the @xmath35 w - pair process at @xmath77  @xcite and the quadratic dependence of the theoretical w - pair cross section on the tgcs cause the negative log - likelihood functions for this final state to exhibit a two - minima structure .",
    "thus the sum of all log - likelihood functions has a smaller curvature than expected with sm cross sections .",
    "expected errors calculated based on the observed cross sections agree well with the observed errors .",
    "multi - parameter fits of tgcs are also performed , which allow for a more model - independent general interpretation of the data .",
    "fits to two of the three c- and p - conserving tgcs @xmath15 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , keeping the third fixed at its sm value , as well as a fit to all three of these tgcs are performed . in each case",
    "the constraints @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath25 are imposed . a three - parameter fit to the tgcs @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath19 is also performed , now imposing the constraints @xmath22 instead .",
    "for the four - parameter fit to @xmath80 , the constraints between the @xmath9ww and the zww couplings are removed while the constraints @xmath81 and @xmath78 are imposed .",
    "the numerical results of all multi - parameter fits to tgcs including the correlation matrices are reported in table  [ tab : ac - res-2 ] .    as an example , the contour curves of 68% and 95% probability derived from fits to two of the three c- and p - conserving tgcs @xmath15 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , keeping the third fixed at its sm value , are shown in figure  [ fig : ac - ndlnl ] .",
    "the contour curves correspond to a change in log - likelihood with respect to its minimum of 1.15 and 3.0 , respectively .",
    "the sources of systematic errors considered include those studied for the w - boson mass and width analysis  @xcite : lep energy , initial- and final - state radiation , jet and lepton measurement , fragmentation and decay , background normalisation and shape , monte carlo statistics , fitting method , and in the case of the @xmath35 final state , colour reconnection and bose - einstein effects .",
    "the methods used to evaluate the effects on tgcs are identical .",
    "the changes in both the central value and the statistical error due to systematic effects are taken into account .",
    "the systematic errors on tgcs for the different models and processes are summarised in tables  [ tab : ac - syst-1 ] and  [ tab : ac - syst-2 ] . in most cases",
    "the total systematic error is dominated by the uncertainty in the experimental selection efficiencies and the theoretical error of 2% on the total cross section predictions .",
    "additional systematic effects arise due to uncertainties in the description of the charge confusion affecting the w charge assignment .",
    "systematic errors due to uncertainties in the mass and total width of the w boson are small .      for the cp conserving but c- and p - violating coupling @xmath16 , the following result is obtained when all other tgcs are fixed to their sm values : @xmath82 the first error is statistical and the second systematic .",
    "the result is in agreement with the sm expectation of @xmath78 . imposing the constraints @xmath78 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , three c- and p - conserving tgcs remain .",
    "the results of fits to the individual couplings , keeping the other two at their sm values , are : @xmath85 the log - likelihood functions for all four one - parameter fits are shown in figure  [ fig : ac-1dlnl ] .",
    "the contribution from w - pair production dominates in the case of @xmath16 , @xmath15 and @xmath18 , while the single - w contribution is important for the constraint on @xmath17 .",
    "the hadronic single - w samples also contribute to the constraints on the zww couplings through the remaining couplings - dependent @xmath36 w - pair background .",
    "the single - photon samples constrain the @xmath9ww couplings only .",
    "all single- and multi - parameter tgc results show good agreement with the sm expectation and imply the existence of the self coupling among the electroweak gauge bosons . the resulting constraints on non - sm contributions to tgcs",
    "are significantly improved with respect to our previous analyses  @xcite .",
    "the measurements exclude a theory by klein  @xcite , predicting a value of @xmath86 , by more than ten standard deviations .",
    "if the w boson were an extended object , , an ellipsoid of rotation with longitudinal radius @xmath87 and transverse radius @xmath88 , its typical size and shape would be related to the tgcs by @xmath89  @xcite and @xmath90  @xcite .",
    "the measurements show no evidence for the w boson to be an extended object : @xmath91 with a correlation coefficient of @xmath92 .",
    "these results establish the pointlike nature of the w boson down to a scale of @xmath93  m.",
    "we wish to congratulate the cern accelerator divisions for the successful upgrade of the lep machine and to express our gratitude for its good performance .",
    "we acknowledge with appreciation the effort of the engineers , technicians and support staff who have participated in the construction and maintenance of this experiment .",
