    "though the ckm paradigm  @xcite of cp violation in the standard model ( sm ) has been extremely successful in describing a multitude of experimental data , in the past few years some indications of deviations have surfaced , specifically in the flavor sector  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing aspect of these deviations is that so far they have more prominently , though not exclusively , occurred in cp violating observables only .",
    "while many beyond the standard model ( bsm ) scenarios can account for such effects  @xcite , a very simple extension of the sm that can cause these anomalies is the addition of an extra family as we emphasized in a recent study  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will extend our previous work and study the implications of the standard model with four generations ( sm4 ) in rare b and k decays .",
    "although our initial motivation for studying sm4 was triggered by the deviations in the cp violating observables in b , @xmath1 decays , we want to stress that actually sm4 is , in fact , a very simple and interesting extension of the three generation sm ( sm3 ) .",
    "the fact that the heavier quarks and leptons in this family can play a crucial role in dynamical electroweak - symmetry breaking ( dewsb ) as an economical way to address the hierarchy puzzle renders this extension of sm3 especially interesting .",
    "in addition , whereas , as is widely recognized sm3 does not have enough cp to facilitate baryogenesis , that difficulty is readily and significantly ameliorated in sm4  @xcite . besides , given that three families exist , it is clearly important to search for the fourth .",
    "that rare b - decays are particularly sensitive to the fourth generation was in fact emphasized long ago  @xcite .",
    "the potential role of heavy quarks in dewsb was also another reason for the earlier interest  @xcite .",
    "lep / slc discovery that a fourth family ( essentially ) massless neutrino does not exist was one reason that caused some pause in the interest on sm4 .",
    "a decade later discovery of neutrino oscillations and of neutrino mass managed to off - set to some degree this concern about the 4th family s necessarily involving massive neutrino .",
    "electroweak precision tests provide a very important constraint on the mass difference of the 4th family isodoublet . in this context",
    "the pdg reviews for a number of years may have been declaring a  prematured death \" of the fourth family  @xcite ; careful studies show in fact that while mass difference between the isodoublet quarks is constrained to be less than @xmath15 gev , an extra generation of quarks is not excluded by the current data .",
    "in fact , it is also claimed that for certain values of particle masses the quality of the fit with four generations is comparable to that of the sm3  @xcite .",
    "the addition of fourth generation to the sm means that the quark mixing matrix will now become a @xmath16 matrix ( @xmath17 ) and the parametrization of this unitary matrix requires six real parameters and three phases .",
    "the two extra phases imply the possibility of extra sources of cp violation @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a fourth family of quarks with @xmath5 in the range of ( 400 - 600 ) gev provides a simple explanation for the several indications of new physics that have been observed involving cp asymmetries in the b , @xmath1 decays  @xcite .",
    "the built - in hierarchy of @xmath17 is such that the @xmath18 readily provides a needed perturbation ( @xmath19 ) to @xmath20 as measured in @xmath21 and simultaneously is the dominant source of cp asymmetry in @xmath8 .",
    "while most of the b , @xmath1 cp - anomalies are easily accommodated and explained by sm4 , we note that , in contrast , ew precision tests constrain the mass - splitting between @xmath18 and @xmath22 to be small , around @xmath23 gev @xcite ; so for @xmath5 of o(500 gev ) their masses have to be degenerate to o(15% ) .",
    "as far as the lepton sector is concerned , it is clear that the 4th family lepton has to be quite different from the previous three families in that the neutral lepton has to be rather massive , with mass @xmath24 .",
    "this may also be a clue that the underlying nature of the 4th family may be quite different from the previous three families @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend our previous work  @xcite on the implications of sm4 , to study the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath25 , @xmath26 and in @xmath27 , forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry in @xmath28 , decay rates of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 and cp violation in @xmath32 and @xmath33 modes .",
    "we show that sm4 can ameliorate the difficulty in understanding the large difference , o(15% ) , between the direct cp asymmetries in neutral b decays to @xmath34 versus that of the charged b - decays to @xmath35 partly due to the enhanced isospin violation that sm4 causes in flavor - changing penguin transitions due to the heavy @xmath5  @xcite originating from the evasion of the decoupling theorem and partly if the corresponding strong phase(s ) are large in sm4 .",
    "the enhanced electroweak penguin amplitude provides a color - allowed ( @xmath36 ) contribution which is not present for @xmath37 case .",
    "however , we want to emphasize that the prediction obtained using the qcd factorization approach  @xcite depends on many input parameters therefore it has large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "apart from the sm parameters such as ckm matrix , quark masses , the strong coupling constant and hadronic parameters there are large theoretical uncertainties related to the modeling of power corrections corresponding to weak annihilation effects and the chirally - enhanced power corrections to hard spectator scattering .",
    "therefore the numerical results for the direct cp asymmetries are not reliable .",
    "several of these observables like fb asymmetry in @xmath38 @xcite , cp asymmetry in @xmath39 @xcite and the decay rate of @xmath31 @xcite have also been studied before , as well as many other interesting aspects of sm4 by hou and collaborators @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "however , their analysis was generally restricted to @xmath5 of @xmath40 300 _ gev_. on the other hand , our analysis seems to favor @xmath5 in the range of ( 400 - 600 ) gev to explain the observed cp asymmetries in the b , @xmath1 decays .",
    "we note also that recent analysis by chanowitz seems to disfavor most of the parameter space they have used @xcite whereas our parameter space is largely unaffected @xcite .",
    "we identify several processes wherein sm4 causes large deviations from the expectations of sm3 ; for example , @xmath41 , @xmath12 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath11 and of course mixing - induced cp in @xmath8 etc .",
    "these observables will be measured with higher statistics at the upcoming high intensity k , b , @xmath1 experiments at cern , fermilab , jparc facilities etc and in particular at the lhcb experiment and possibly also at the super - b factories and hence may provide further indirect evidence for an additional family of quarks .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . after the introduction , we provide constraints on the 4@xmath454 ckm matrix by incorporating oblique corrections along with experimental data from important observables involving z",

    "[ concl ] , we present our summary .",
    "in our previous article @xcite , to find the limits on @xmath17 elements , we concentrated mainly on the constraints that will come from vertex correction to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 mixing , @xmath51 and indirect _",
    "violation in @xmath52 described by @xmath53 .",
    "we did not consider @xmath54 as a constraint because of its large hadronic uncertainties .",
    "chanowitz @xcite has shown that as @xmath5 becomes very large more important constraint is from non decoupling oblique corrections rather than the vertex correction to @xmath46 . in this article",
    "we have extended our analysis by including the constraint form non decoupling oblique corrections as well ; we note that for @xmath55 _ gev _ our previous constraints are largely unaffected but for @xmath56 _ gev _ the oblique corrections start to have effect . with the inputs given in table .",

    "of course , the electroweak precision tests suggest then a possible heavy higgs particle but this actually may be hinting at a very interesting resolution to the hierarchy puzzle .",
    "this is because heavier quarks of the 4th generation can play a significant role in dynamical electroweak - symmetry breaking , i.e. a composite higgs particle .",
    "another extremely interesting implication of a 4th family is the gigantic improvement over the three generation case in the context of baryogenesis , as in particular emphasized by hou  @xcite .",
    "these two implications of a 4th family are in themselves so interesting , if not profound , that even though at this time the repercussions for dark matter and/or unification are not quite clear , the idea should be given a serious consideration .",
    "although one of us ( a.s . ) had gotten already interested and involved in the physics of the 4th generation over twenty years ago , our recent interest was instigated by the fact that this obvious extension of the standard model offers a simple solution to many of the anomalies that have been seen in b , @xmath1 decays .",
    "for one thing the predicted value of @xmath20 in the sm is coming out to be too high from the one directly measured via the gold - plated @xmath179 mode . besides , the value of @xmath20 measured via many of the penguin - dominated modes is systematically coming out to be smaller than the predicted value .",
    "then there is the very large difference in the direct cp asymmetry between @xmath34 and @xmath35 decays of the @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "finally , there is the fact that both cdf and d0 find that @xmath8 decays are exhibiting o(2@xmath0 ) non - vanishing cp asymmetries whereas sm predicts vanishing small asymmetry .",
    "the effect seen in @xmath8 at fermilab is doubly significant .",
    "first of all two of the anomalies discussed above that were seen at b - factories taken seriously suggest a non - standard cp - odd phase in @xmath162 transitions . that then makes it extremely difficult , if not impossible , for new physics not to show up as well in @xmath1 mixing ; thus the b - factory anomalies basically imply non - standard cp effects in mixing induced cp - asymmetry in @xmath8 .",
    "the second crucial aspect of the cp asymmetry in @xmath8 is that it is a gold - plated effect ; that is the fact that in the sm cp asymmetry in that mode should be vanishingly small is a very clean prediction with no serious hadronic uncertainty .",
    "therefore it is extremely important that fermilab gives very high priority to confirming or refuting this effect .",
    "in fact very soon the lhcb experiment at cern should also be able to study this mode and clarify this issue .    in an earlier paper we had focused on studying the cp anomalies seen in b",
    ", @xmath1 decays in sm4 mentioned above ; we found that the sm4 offers a simple explanation for most of the anomalies with the heavy quarks of mass around 400 - 600 gev .",
    "this paper is a follow - up wherein we further explore the implications of sm4 for k and b , @xmath1 decays . by using a host of measurements in k ,",
    "b , @xmath1 decays such as indirect cp violation parameter @xmath182 , @xmath183 , mixing induced cp asymmetry in @xmath21 , br ( @xmath2 ) , semi - leptonic decays of b etc along with oblique parameters and br ( @xmath184 ) , we first constrained the enlarged 4@xmath454 ckm - matrix .",
    "we then explored the implications of the sm4 for a variety of processes such as @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , cp asymmetries in @xmath192 and in @xmath193 etc .",

    "one of the most interesting aspect of the 4th generation hypothesis is that it is testable relatively easily in the lhc experiments where in fact it has distinctive signatures @xcite . in the coming few years",
    "not only we should be able to learn about the existence or lack thereof of quarks and leptons of the 4th family , the heavier higgs that is also favored in sm4 scenario should be easier to search for in the lhc experiments via the gold - plated mode : @xmath196 . also the heavy higgs has interesting implications for flavour - diagonal and flavour - changing final states involving @xmath18 and/or @xmath22 @xcite .",

    "<S> we extend our recent work and study implications of the standard model with four generations ( sm4 ) for rare b and k decays . </S>",

    "<S> sm4 is also of course of considerable interest for its potential relevance to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and to baryogenesis . using experimental information from processes such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 mixings , indirect cp - violation from @xmath4 etc along with oblique corrections , </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the relevant parameter space of the sm4 , and find @xmath5 of about 400 - 600 gev with a mixing angle @xmath6 in the range of about ( 0.05 to 1.4)@xmath7 and with an appreciable cp - odd associated phase , are favored by the current data . given the unique role of the cp asymmetry in @xmath8 due to its gold - plated nature , correlation of that with many other interesting observables , including the semileptonic asymmetry ( @xmath9 ) are studied in sm4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify several processes , such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 etc , that are significantly different in sm4 from the sm . experimentally </S>",
    "<S> the very distinctive process @xmath12 is also discussed ; the branching ratio can be larger or smaller than in sm , @xmath13 , by a factor of @xmath14 . </S>"
