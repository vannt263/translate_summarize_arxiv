    "this is obviously not the case here since the zero temperature shapes of the inner and outer sections are different : even though the number of modes in the inner section is smaller than in the outer ones , their fluctuations are strongly enhanced on a curved background and thus always dominate the fluctuations of the outer less curved region .",
