    "the holy grail of computational materials design is the _ ab initio _ discovery of new materials which can be synthesized to have specific desired properties .",
    "our increasing understanding of the structure / properties relationship in many materials and our increasing computational resources make this an exciting possibility .",
    "@xcite however , in many cases , the precise relationship between structure and properties is not yet well understood .",
    "this is the case for strongly correlated electron materials which exhibit interesting phenomena such as superconductivity , colossal magnetoresistance , and multiferroic behavior .",
    "@xcite    despite lacking a theory to immediately predict the properties of strongly correlated materials from structure alone , phenomenological observations often suggest families of composition and types of structures which are likely to exhibit specific functionalities .",
    "having identified a family of such structures , the question becomes whether one can synthesize new materials in these families having enhanced properties .",
    "unfortunately , the number of candidate materials which one might identify is often very large , and the experimental costs in searching for compounds can thus be heavy .",
    "therefore , a computational method for predicting the stability of hypothetical compounds is highly desirable .",
    "a variety of computational structure search methods have been presented including random search methods , genetic algorithms and other heuristic methods , and sophisticated data - mining approaches .",
    "@xcite however , such methods are non - ideal for our application ; because we are interested in searching for structures at many different compositions , random search and heuristic methods often require a prohibitively large amount of computation time .",
    "formal data - mining approaches often fail in ternary and higher - order systems as there is an insufficient amount of data available .",
    "in addition , all of these methods require a significant amount of resources devoted to software development . in our case ,",
    "the parallel progress of experiment and theory led to fast results .",
    "neither theory nor experiment alone could have progressed to explore this material system with modest devoted resources and on the same timescale of several months .    in this paper",
    "we report on our exploration of the ce - ir - in ternary phase diagram .",
    "cerium - based transition metal indide compounds adopt a large variety of structure and bonding arrangements which produce a large variety of interesting physical phenomena including superconductivity .",
    "@xcite two types of structures which we are interested in exploring include systems with ce sublattices which exist in either square planar or geometrically frustrated arrangements .",
    "experience with cuprates , iron - pnictide , organic , and heavy fermion superconductors suggests that the square - planar compounds are likely to exhibit superconductivity .",
    "@xcite in geometrically frustrated systems , large degeneracies can lead to novel physical phenomena .",
    "@xcite    using this method , we examine the structural stability of selected compounds in the ce - ir - in ternary phase diagram and predict two previously unknown compounds , ceir@xmath0 in and ce@xmath1ir@xmath1 in , to be stable .",
    "subsequently , we were able to synthesize ceir@xmath0 in , which possesses a geometrically frustrated ce sublattice .",
    "at thermal equilibrium , a compound is stable if it has a negative formation energy with respect to its constituent elemental and any other competing phases .",
    "@xcite the formation energy per atom for a ternary compound ce@xmath2ir@xmath3in@xmath4 with respect to its constituent elements may be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the gibbs free energies per atom of the elemental phases .    using these formation energies , stable and competing phases can easily be illustrated . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] , each compound is plotted according to its composition and formation energy .",
    "then , the smallest surface encompassing all points is known as the convex hull , and points which lie on the convex hull itself are thermodynamically stable .",
    "( color online ) predicted ce - ir - in phase diagram .",
    "the top - down view of the convex hull of the energy of the various ce - ir - in phases illustrates which phases are stable and unstable at zero temperature .",
    "the ternary phases at corners of triangle represent stable ternary compounds , _",
    "i.e. _ compounds such as ce@xmath9ir@xmath10in@xmath11 ( 1 ) , ceirin@xmath9 ( 3 ) , and ceir@xmath11 in ( 5 ) are predicted to be stable .",
    "compounds such as ceirin@xmath10 ( 7 ) , ceir@xmath10in@xmath12 ( 12 ) , and ceir@xmath9in@xmath10 ( 13 ) fall within the hull , rather than on its surface , and are predicted to be unstable .",
    "the binary and ternary compounds are numbered following their order in table  [ tab : results].,width=321 ]    both our computational and experimental techniques have limitations in finding these low - energy structures . identifying candidate structures is an open challenge to the computational methods which also have known systematic errors .",
    "the annealing process in experimental synthesis techniques may fail to find the lowest energy structure due to kinetic barriers and insufficient driving forces .",
    "thus , synthesis routes may exist which allow us to produce metastable compounds and at the same time it may be difficult to realize the true ground state",
    ".      calculation of the entire gibbs free energy is computationally expensive and unnecessary .",
    "the internal energy contribution to the free energy dominates the enthalpic and entropic terms , particularly at low temperature and pressure . in this work ,",
    "energies are calculated and evaluated in the zero temperature and pressure limit , neglecting zero point energies which are small in these heavy elements .",
    "our dft calculations are performed using vasp  @xcite with the projector - augmented wave paw method in the generalized gradient approximation pbe .",
    "@xcite energy differences between compounds were converged to within 0.3  mev / atom using a plane wave cutoff energy of 400  ev and a k - point mesh of density 40  @xmath13 . during the structural optimization , the brillioun zone integration was performed using the methfessel - paxton scheme with a smearing of 0.2  ev and for the final structure , the energy was calculated using the linear tetrahedron method with blchl corrections .",
    "@xcite    our method of exploring the ternary phase space requires initial guesses of the crystal structure for a variety of compositions .",
    "the results presented here take advantage of the fact that a compound s structure is often reasonably close to that of a related ternary compound composed of different elements .",
    "@xcite for example , the structure of cerhin@xmath14 can be used as a guess for the structure of cetmin@xmath14 , where tm is any transition metal . following this approach we assembled a set of candidate structures from known compounds in the ce - ir - in systems and related binary and ternary systems . specifically , we selected the known elemental , binary and ternary compounds of the ce - ir - in , ce - pt - in , ce - rh - in , and ce - pd - al ternary and the ru - in binary systems .",
    "we did not , however , include all known compounds of these systems , but rather selected those which experimental experience has shown most often form in ce - ir - in ternary phases and other chemically - similar systems . after determining the formation energy for all the candidate structures , we determine the 3-dimensional convex hull , by plotting the composition versus formation energy with respect to the elemental phases . those compounds that form the convex hull are energetically stable while the compounds above the hull have a positive formation energy against competing phases and are unstable and hence difficult or impossible to synthesize . from the hull",
    ", we can also identify competing phases .",
    "calculating the formation energy of a compound with respect to its competing phases allows us to identify its degree of stability .",
    "stable compounds will exhibit a negative formation energy with respect to competing phases .",
    "the success of this project is due to the close communication between experimental and theoretical efforts .",
    "the sharing of preliminary information between the groups about particular structures and entire portions of the phase diagram was instrumental in accelerating the discovery process .",
    "compounds can be synthesized in a large variety of ways .",
    "for those compounds which were previously unknown to our knowledge ( namely ceir@xmath0 in and ce@xmath1ir@xmath1 in ) we attempted to synthesize these crystals by arc melting .",
    "the synthesis of ceir@xmath0 in was carried out via arc - melting the respective elements in a stoichiometric ratio of ce : ir : in - 1:4:1 .",
    "the resulting button was flipped over 3 times and completely melted in order to ensure the reaction product was homogeneous .",
    "after the arc - melting , the pellet was weighed and was found to have less than a 5  mg loss .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction on the as cast pellet was completed on an x-1 scintag diffractometer in the 2@xmath15 range of 10 - 80@xmath16 .",
    "the powder pattern was refined using the jade software package .",
    "the attempted synthesis of ce@xmath1ir@xmath1 in was carried out via arc - melting the respective elements in a stoichiometric ratio of ce : ir : in of 2:2:1 .",
    "characterization measurements of the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity were performed in commercial systems from quantum design .",

    "if ir hybridizes more strongly than pt , this would favor the scenario where the magnetic anomalies are a result of impurity phases , and ceir@xmath0 in is approaching mixed valent behavior akin to ceni@xmath0 in .",
    "consequently , it is currently inconclusive as to whether geometric frustration is playing a significant role in ceir@xmath0 in .",

    "in addition , for ce@xmath10irin@xmath22 and ceirin@xmath10 which are predicted to be unstable but are known , and ce@xmath10ir@xmath10 in which is predicted to be stable but has yet to be found , the formation energies relative to competing phases are sufficiently small that we might expect that some of the neglected effects mentioned above might change the conclusion with regards to compound formation . we must then also acknowledge that given the small positive formation energy with respect to competing phases for ceir@xmath10in@xmath11 and ceir@xmath10in@xmath10 , which is less than 56  mev / atom , it would not be surprising if either or both of these compounds are eventually synthesized .",
    "in addition to the possible shortcomings of the dft calculations mentioned earlier , we also recognize that the phase space of potential compounds which we are exploring is remarkably small . not only have we selected a relatively small number of compositions , but we have also assumed a particular structure type for each of these compositions . in this respect ,",
    "the addition of simulated annealing , genetic algorithms and other approaches  @xcite to this approach may aide in discovering additional structures not considered based on analogy .",
    "the fact that arc melting ce@xmath10ir@xmath10 in and annealing did not produce the anticipated structure does not necessarily mean that the compound is unstable .",
    "however , it shows that ce@xmath10ir@xmath10 in can not be a congruently melting compound and that the phase is either not stable at 800@xmath16c or that a direct transformation from the competing phases may exhibit slow kinetics .",
    "alternative synthesis routes should be considered to stabilize the compound .",
    "these could be as simple as using a different temperature annealing profile or using another synthesis route such as flux growth .",
    "@xcite thus , we anticipate that the effort in trying to synthesize a theoretically predicted compound by this method will be commensurate with the interest that the expected properties of that compound would generate .    despite these potential complications , the fact that our combined computational and experimental approach demonstrates an accuracy of better than 80% in identifying which compounds exist or",
