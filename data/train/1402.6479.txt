    "these results have been generalized in @xcite .",
    "later lenzmann proved in @xcite that this ground state is unique ( up to translations and phase change ) provided that the mass @xmath15 is sufficiently small ; some results about the non - degeneracy of the ground state solution are also given .",

    "we show that such a functional satisfies the palais - smale condition below some energy level determined by the value of @xmath3 at infinity and we prove the existence of a mountain pass solution under the level where the palais - smale condition holds . finally we also furnish some asymptotic decay estimates of the found solution .",
