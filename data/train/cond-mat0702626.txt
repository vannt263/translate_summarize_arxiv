    "one of the universally recognized common feature of these cmr compounds is the sizable ferromagnetic ( fm ) hund s rule coupling @xmath3 between the core spins and those of the @xmath4 electrons .",
    "this gives the double - exchange ( de ) interaction@xcite which is believed to be a fundamental mechanism in explaining many of the interesting features of the cmr compounds .",
    "from this point of view , a usual starting point to analyze the properties of the cmr material is the standard de hamiltonian , supplemented with other terms , such as the hubbard repulsion @xmath5 , the antiferromagnetic ( af ) superexchange interactions between core spins @xmath6 , etc . for the case of cmr manganites ,",

    "we propose a mean - field theory based on the slave fermion scheme , which exhibits spin - charge separation at low energy , and use it to calculate various low - energy properties in the fm metallic phase . among them ,",
    "the most important result is that the quasiparticle peak in the electron spectral function is reduced at low temperatures and the spectral weight is transferred to an asymmetric broad peak away from the fermi surface , which is a natural consequence of the spin - charge separation in our theory .",

    "since @xmath320 is irrelevant around the fixed point described by @xmath317 , our low energy effective theory shows clearly that the fm phase of the qde model exhibits the phenomenon of spin - charge separation .",
    "that is , the low energy excitations are holons described by the @xmath296 field , which carry charge @xmath321 and spin zero , and the fm spin waves ( magnons ) described by the @xmath297 field , which are charge neutral and carry spin-@xmath57 .",
    "this is very different from the usual itinerant ferromagnets , where the elementary excitations are the dressed electrons , which carry charge @xmath322 and spin-@xmath323 , and the magnons , which are collective excitations in the particle - hole channel .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the low - energy physics of the qde model based on the slave fermion formulation .",
    "the most important feature of this approach is that the effects of large values of @xmath5 and @xmath3 are taken into account right from the beginning .",

    "this results in a non - fermi - liquid ground state , in contrast to most of the previous studies on the de model .",
    "a direct consequence following it is that the electron spectral function exhibits a broad asymmetric peak away from the fermi surface , in addition to the quasiparticle peak .",
    "both our results about the low energy magnetic properties and low - temperature thermodynamics are also consistent with experimental data in the fm metallic phase . on the other hand ,",
    "our prediction for the optical conductivity at low energy is only qualitatively consistent with experiments .",
    "quantitatively , the drude weight we obtained is larger than that actually observed .",
    "this indicates that to have a good quantitative description for the low - frequency optical spectra of manganties , some extra ingredients beyond the one - orbital qde model must be taken into account .",
    "however , we should emphasize that , for such a scenario to be valid , the inclusion of these new ingredients should not affect the low - temperature thermodynamics and low - energy magnetic properties predicted by the one - orbital qde model in any drastic way because the one - orbital model already gives rise to reasonable results on them .",
    "we have also studied the role of gauge fluctuations and derived a low energy continuum effective theory .",
    "a previous study in terms of the slave - fermion gauge theory claimed that the gapless _ longitudinal _",
    "gauge fluctuations play a dominant role on the electronic spectral properties.@xcite however , the longitudinal component of gauge fields is gauge dependent and physics should be independent of the gauge choice .",
    "moreover , both the time and longitudinal components of gauge fields are screened in the metallic phase , which can not affect low energy physics dramatically . what we do in sec .",
    "[ gauge ] is to explicitly show that the gauge fluctuations in the fm phase , both the transverse and longitudinal components , are completely screened due to the anderson - higgs mechanism .",
    "the resulting electron spectral function in the fm metallic phase consists of two parts : one the sharp quasiparticle peak at the fermi energy and the other an asymmetric broad peak away from the fermi energy , instead of a broad quasiparticle peak at the fermi energy .",
    "these predictions can be observed from the arpes or sts measurements .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the slave fermion formulation also gives a clear picture of the apparently observed fermi liquid behavior and its possible deviations . within this framework ,",
    "the fermi - liquid - like behaviors , such as a small value of the drude weight in the optical spectra and a small coherent quasi - particle peak in the electron spectral function , are consequences of the bose condensation of the spinon field .",
    "therefore , the spectral weight is directly related to the magnitude of the condensate . based on the similar reasoning",
    ", we expect that in low dimensional or layered materials where the quantum fluctuations tend to kill the bose condensate , the coherent quasi - particle peak will either disappear completely or be greatly reduced in comparison with the three - dimensional results we obtained here.@xcite this is actually observed in the arpes measurements for layered compounds.@xcite another minimal extension of the one - orbital qde model , which has the potential to reduce the quasi - particle peak or the drude weight , is to include the orbital degrees of freedom . in this case",
    ", we have two slave boson fields : one describing the spin fluctuations and the other describing the orbital fluctuations .",
    "if only the spin slave field condenses at low temperature , the strong orbital fluctuations will also tend to reduce the coherent parts in the optical conductivity and the electron spectral function .",
