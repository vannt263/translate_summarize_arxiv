    "a couple of remarks are in order : first , the ddft equation can be derived from the smoluchowski equation @xcite by using one essential approximation , namely the so - called adiabatic approximation stating that the one - particle density field is the single slow variable of the system ( i.e. all other variable are much faster ) @xcite . thereby nonequilibrium correlations are approximated by equilibrium correlations .",

    "+   + there is a plethora of possible further applications and generalizations of ddft .",
    "it should be noticed that ddft can be applied to _ arbitrary confined geometries _ by a suitable modeling of the external potential @xmath17 which in general , however , requires a full numerical solution of the problem . as an example , a rather straightforward modification of the present study could consist in replacing the tilted plane potential in eq .   by an oscillating plane potential or a tilted ratchet potential @xcite .",
    "note also that _ hydrodynamic interactions _ between particles and particles and walls @xcite can be readily incorporated into the ddft approach @xcite on an approximate level , at the expense of higher numerical effort for the evaluation of the transport equations .",
    "in addition , bulk phase transitions including _ crystallization _ are in principle included in the equilibrium functional @xcite and therefore the dynamics of crystallization can be explored @xcite .",
    "phase transitions have been intensely studied in the conceptually simpler phase - field - crystal ( pfc ) approach @xcite , and it would be interesting to explore the dynamics of crystallization in confined geometry , which is still an open problem .",
    "ddft can readily be applied to _",
    "mixtures _ , see e.g. @xcite , and to _ orientational _ degrees of freedom relevant for liquid crystals @xcite where even an arbitrary particle shape has been considered @xcite , including general brownian orientational diffusion . in addition ,",
    "even more complex situations like a _ temperature gradient _ can be tackled by using ddft @xcite . +   + finally , _ active _ brownian particles @xcite can be considered and again ddft is generalizable to this recently extensively studied nonequilibrium class of systems @xcite .",
    "experiments on colloids @xcite and bacteria @xcite have proven that the brownian statistics with white noise is sufficient to describe the data .",
    "even single active particles show various new phenomena such as circle swimming @xcite , rectification @xcite , negative mobility @xcite and polar order @xcite .",
    "and we are still at the beginning to understand the fascinating collective behavior such as turbulence @xcite , clustering @xcite and crystallization @xcite of active swimmers .",
