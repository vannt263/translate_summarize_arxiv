    "the precise measurement of final state hadrons in lepton nucleon deep inelastic scattering constitutes an excellent benchmark for different features of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "these processes are crucially sensitive to the three main ingredients of pqcd : the parton content of the nucleon , the hadronization mechanism of partons into the detected final state hadron , and the parton radiation before and after the interaction with the electromagnetic prove .",
    "the first of these ingredients is well characterized by modern parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the knowledge on these distributions have become increasingly precise as a result of two decades of high precision inclusive measurements , and the corresponding qcd analyses , driven by the role of pdfs as inputs for theoretical predictions for any experiment involving initial state hadrons @xcite .",
    "although the high degree of accuracy attained by pdfs , less inclusive observables , sensitive to flavor combinations of pdfs other than those relevant in inclusive measurements , improve the insight and provide a further check on the universality of pdfs and on factorization .",
    "the second ingredient is addressed by the so called fragmentation functions ( ff ) , which are rapidly evolving following the path of pdfs , but without attaining yet the refinement of the latter @xcite .",
    "most of the data used to determine these distributions , which come essentially from electron - positron annihilation into hadrons , give no information on how the individual quark flavor fragments into hadrons and leave a considerable uncertainty on the gluon density .",
    "for these reasons , the nlo analysis of one particle inclusive data is crucial for the extraction of fragmentation functions .",
    "the last ingredient concerns higher order qcd calculations , which have been explored and validated for most processes up to next to leading order ( nlo ) accuracy , and are currently being extended even beyond that point . for the one particle inclusive processes",
    "only very recently there has been progress beyond the leading order ( lo ) @xcite . however , up to now there were no analytic computation of the @xmath2 corrections for the electroproduction of hadrons with non vanishing transverse momentum .",
    "the analytic computation of the @xmath2 corrections allows us to check factorization in a direct way , which means that collinear singularities showing up in the partonic cross section factorize into pdfs as required by inclusive deep inelastic scattering , and into ffs for electron - positron annihilation into hadrons . as a consequence of this explicit cancellation",
    ", the resulting cross section is finite and can be straightforwardly convoluted with pdfs and ffs in a faster and more stable numerical code , compared to what can be usually obtained in numerical implementations using either the subtraction @xcite or the slicing @xcite methods .",
    "the analytical result is still sufficiently exclusive and keeps the dependence on the rapidity and the transverse momentum of the produced hadron , allowing a detailed comparison with the experimental data .    in this paper",
    "we compute the order @xmath0 corrections to the one particle inclusive leptoproduction cross section of hadrons with non vanishing transverse momentum .",
    "we perform the cancellation of collinear singularities analytically , and obtain the full expression of the factorized , and thus finite , cross section at this order .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we summarize the relevant kinematics and details about the phase space integration for the o(@xmath0 ) contributions to the cross section , together with the conventions and notation adopted . in section",
    "ii we compute the corresponding real and virtual amplitudes , we discuss the nature of the singularities that contribute to them , we analyse the factorization of collinear singularities , and pay special attention to the scale dependence induced in the cross section by this factorization procedure . section iii deals with the phenomenological implications of the new corrections .",
    "specifically , we compare our results with data on forward production of @xmath1 , presented recently by the h1 collaboration , as an example , and evaluate the phenomenological implications of the rather large higher order corrections .",
    "special attention is paid to the cross section sensitivity to the factorization scale choosen , and to the fragmentation functions input as sources of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we also analyze the consequences of the forward pion selection on the lo and nlo underlying partonic processes , finding this kinematical suppression as the main reason for the unusual difference between the lo and nlo estimates . in agreement with the results obtained in @xcite",
    ", we conclude that the data is well described by the pure dokshitzer - grivov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xmath2 predictions within the theoretical uncertainties , but without need to appeal to resolved photon contributions , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "we begin with the kinematical characterization of the one particle inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes . since the choice of variables required to deal with the singularity structure of electroproduction is different from those used in both photo - production @xcite and electroproduction in the very forward region @xcite , in the following we discuss it in some detail .",
    "we consider the process @xmath3 where a lepton of momentum @xmath4 scatters off a nucleon of momentum @xmath5 with a lepton of momentum @xmath6 and a hadron @xmath7 of momentum @xmath8 tagged in the final state . omitting target fragmentation at zero transverse momentum , which has been discussed at length in @xcite ,",
    "the cross section for this process can be written as @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the partonic level cross section corresponding to the process @xmath11 before renormalization of the coupling constant and factorization of collinear singularities . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the bare parton densities and fragmentation functions , and dps@xmath14 the @xmath15-parton phase space . @xmath16 is the proton momentum fraction carried by the parton @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the fraction of parton @xmath19 momentum taken away by the final state hadron .",
    "in addition to the usual dis variables , @xmath20 we define mandelstam variables both at parton and at hadron level : @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the above definitions imply @xmath22 notice that the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) region exists only for @xmath25 , feature that considerably reduces the integration region in the case of photo - production .",
    "the following step is the definition of suitable partonic variables to characterize the phase space .",
    "the choice of these variables is critical for the identification and further prescription of collinear singularities in the partonic cross section .",
    "we find particularly useful the variables @xmath26 with @xmath27 $ ] . in terms of these partonic variables , the @xmath15-particle phase space can be factorized as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 includes the phase space of the ` spectator ' partons ( those that not fragment into the detected final state hadron ) and the corresponding jacobian .",
    "for example for @xmath30 , in @xmath31 dimensions we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the angles defined by the spectator partons in their center of mass frame . in terms of the factorized phase space ,",

    ", the necessity of integrating the phase space of the unobserved particles , but keeping the full dependence on the variables characterizing the final state hadron ( and thus of the parton from where it comes ) , makes the computation of higher order corrections much more involved than the inclusive case . in the present case we showed that , with a suitable parameterization of the phase space , the necessary integrations can be performed analytically and the remaining singularities can be dealt with standard prescription recipes , without the need of substraction or phase space slicing methods .",

    "the main contributions to these corrections come from the partonic subprocess @xmath123 which appears for the first time at that order .",

    "concerning the phenomenological consequences of our results , we compared them with recent data coming from the h1 experiment at hera @xcite . within the uncertainties arising from the scale dependence and the particular sensitivity of the results to the gluon hadronization mechanism , parameterized in the fragmentation functions",
    ", we found a very good agreement between data and theoretical expectations for both the @xmath92 and @xmath37 distributions .",
    "in particular , fixing the factorization and renormalization scales as just the average between the photon virtuality and the transverse momentum of the final state hadron , both distributions are well described by purely dglap evolution .",
    "we also found that the experimental cuts applied to the h1 data play a crucial role , boosting the nlo corrections , and thus explaining the unusual poor description of the lo estimate .",
    "finally , our results are in agreement with those obtained previously by numerical methods @xcite .",
    "the large k - factors and the significant factorization scale dependence , both related to the opening of new channels at nlo , suggest the presence of non negligible nnlo effects .",
    "this feature , altogether with the fact that data is reasonably described by nlo estimates within uncertainties , obliterate any further effect that might contribute , like the resolved component of the photon or those coming from bfkl dynamics in the present experiments .",

    "<S> we compare our results with h1 data on forward production of @xmath1 , and discuss the phenomenological implications of the rather large higher order contributions obtained in that case . </S>",

    "<S> we conclude that the data is well described by the @xmath2 predictions within the theoretical uncertainties and without the inclusion of any physics content beyond the dglap approach .        . </S>"
