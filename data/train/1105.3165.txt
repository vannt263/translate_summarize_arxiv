    "general relativity ( gr ) is widely accepted as a fundamental theory to describe the geometric properties of spacetime @xcite . in an homogeneous and isotropic spacetime , the so - called friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model ,",
    "the einstein field equations give rise to the friedmann equations that describe the evolution of the universe .",
    "it describes the universe from around one second after the big bang to the present matter dominated era .",
    "this standard model s success is in part due to several of its predictions having been verified by observation .",
    "for example , the abundances helium with respect to other light elements observed in the universe agrees well with the predictions of this model .",
    "the period of recombination is strongly supported by the cmb which is arguably the strongest evidence supporting the standard model . a good amount of observational data",
    "indicate quite clearly that the present universe is in an accelerated expanding phase @xcite",
    ". the universe may enter in a so - called phantom era with an effective equation of state parameter @xmath7 less than @xmath8 . the simplest way to explain this phantom dark energy era",
    "is based on the introduction of a scalar field with negative kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "the main property of such a phantom field in the accelerating frw universe is the appearance of finite - time future singularity @xcite ( see @xcite for the classification of singularities ) . in turn",
    ", this can lead to bizarre consequences such as negative entropy of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , gr is not the only relativistic theory of gravity . in the last decades",
    "several generalizations of einstein field equations has been proposed @xcite . within these extended theories of gravity nowadays , a subclass known as @xmath9 theory are an alternative for classical problems , as the accelerated expansion of the universe , instead of the dark energy and quintessence models @xcite .",
    "then , an effective phantom phase can be realized without a scalar phantom .",
    "@xmath9 theories of gravity are basically extensions of the einstein - hilbert action with an arbitrary function of ricci scalar @xmath0 @xcite",
    ". there are three formalisms in deriving field equations from the action in f(r ) gravity .",
    "the first is the standard metric formalism in which the field equations are derived by the variation of the action with respect to the metric tensor @xmath10 . in this formalism",
    "the affine connection @xmath11 depends on @xmath10 .",
    "the second is the palatini formalism @xcite in which the metric and the connection are treated as independent variables when the action is varied .",
    "the third is the metric - affine formalism is which the gravitational action is a general function of the scalar curvature while the matter action is allowed to depend also on the connection @xcite . note that these approaches give different field equations in f(r ) gravity , while for the gr action they are identical with each other .",
    "the methodology leads to a boundary contribution which is usually dropped out setting null fluxes through gauss - stokes theorem @xcite . in this paper we will use the metric formalism for obtaining the field equations .    as we mentioned above , in einstein gravity , when the dark energy is introduced for explaining the late acceleration of the universe",
    ", finite time singularities can appear .",
    "note that even in f(r ) gravity where we do not need to introduce the dark energy for explaining the late acceleration , finite time singularities can also appear in a background driven by a dark fluid .",
    "the question to be asked is : does particle creation can avoid these singularities or modify their nature ?",
    "particle production phenomenon in f(r ) is then analysed in this paper and its impact as quantum effects is checked at singularity time .    particle production from the vacuum by the gravitational field using quantum field theory in an expanding universe has been introduced firstly by parker in the 1960s @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting results of this work is that in a radiative dominated expanding universe there is no massless particle creation due to the conformal invariance of the metric .",
    "latter , quantum process of particle production has been studied by several authors , done in the course of the cosmological expansion @xcite .",
    "recently , various investigations in the aim of dealing with singularities have been done .",
    "batista and collaborators @xcite studied the effects of particle creation when a massless scalar field is minimally coupled with the einstein gravity .",
    "they found that the energy density of created particles never dominates the phantom energy density . in the same way ,",
    "quantum effects near the big rip are studied in @xcite where they used the @xmath6-wave regularization for calculating the energy density of particle creation and found that , in this case , it tends to infinity when the big rip is approached and becomes the dominant component of the universe .",
    "this means that big rip can be avoided .",
    "pavlov @xcite computed both the number density of created particles and the stress - energy tensor for a conformally coupled massive field for the case in which @xmath12 .",
    "he found that quantum effects are not important if the field mass is much smaller than the planck mass and the time left to the big rip is greater than the planck time .",
    "bates and anderson @xcite used a background field approach in which the energy densities of the quantized fields are computed in the background spacetime which contains the big rip singularity .",
    "they found that for fields in realistic states for which the energy density of the quantized fields is small compared to that of the phantom energy density at early times , and for spacetimes with realistic values of @xmath7 , there is no evidence that quantum effects become large enough to significantly affect the expansion of the spacetime until the spacetime curvature is of the order of the planck scale or larger , at which point the semi classical approximation breaks down .",
    "the calculations of particle production is usually done comparing the particle number at asymptotically early times , or with respect to vacuum state defined in two different frames .",
    "however , treating of quantizaton in curved space the main problem concerns the field theory interpretation in terms of particles .",
    "note that in curved spacetime there is no poincar group symmetry and the notion of vacuum becomes ambiguous .",
    "the problem may be solved using the diagonalization method of instantaneous hamiltonian by a bogoliubov transformation which leads to a finite results for the created particles number @xcite .",
    "particles are created because the modes with positive and negative frequency of the field become mixed during the universe expansion .",
    "particle production is directly connected with the curvature of the universe and then when the field equation is put in the form of harmonic oscillator equation without friction part , its effect appears in the effective mass .",
    "hence , in the radiative dominated universe with massless scalar field , either of zero or non - conformal coupling , the effective mass vanishes and the modes are not mixed in the course of the expansion due to conformal invariant of the metric and as consequence there is no creation of massless particles .",
    "note also that in the static universe where the scale factor is constant and the energy density of ordinary matter is null , even the field is massive and minimally or conformally coupled with einstein gravity , the effective mass vanishes and once again there is no particle production . however",
    ", even the density of ordinary matter is null and the modified gravity is taken into account , this could not hold . under some assumptions",
    "the scale in such a condition could not be constant and as consequence , particle could be created .    in this paper",
    "we use the ansatz that the function @xmath13 and analyse the phenomenon of particle creation . in a first step",
    "we verify a known result that the particle production is the same as in einstein gravity and this is seen through the scale factor behaviour .",
    "we consider the main content of the universe as the dark fluid and analyse particle production phenomenon .",
    "note that with this dark fluid driven the background , the universe may present the big rip .",
    "quantum effects from particle creation is then checked near this singularity , comparing the classical energy density of the dark fluid with the renormalised energy density from the stress tensor corresponding to a massless minimally couple scalar field .",
    "we find that depending on the values of the parameter @xmath6 , the big rip can be avoided .",
    "then , we find that for @xmath14\\frac{1}{2},1[$ ] the big rip can be removed whereas for @xmath4 it remains .    in the second step an attention",
    "is devoted to the cardy - verlinde formula based on inhomogeneous equation of state .",
    "verlinde @xcite made an interesting proposal that cardy formula @xcite in two - dimensional conformal field theory can be generalized to arbitrary spacetime dimensions .",
    "verlinde further proposed that a closed universe has subextensive ( casimir ) contribution to its energy and entropy with the casimir energy conjectured to be bounded from above by the bekenstein - hawking energy and as consequence , one obtains a very deep relation between gravity and thermodynamics @xcite . within the context of the radiation dominated universe , such bound on the casimir energy",
    "is shown to lead to the hubble and the bekenstein entropy bounds respectively for the strongly and the weakly self - gravitating universes .",
    "the generalized entropy formula , called the cv formula , is further shown to coincide with the total entropy of the universe coming from the friedmann equations .",
    "these results were later generalized @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to analyse the equivalence between the cv formula and the total entropy coming from the generalized friedmann equations in f(r ) theory .",
    "hence , we find that for the inhomogeneous eos , the cv formula can always be recovered from the generalized entropy of the universe in einstein gravity but only for @xmath5 in f(r ) gravity .",
    "moreover we check the behaviour of the cv formula terms near the singularity and find particularly that the casimir energy decreases as the universe expands and vanishes near the singularity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section a breve notion on particle production in expanding universe is addressed with the use of the diagonalization of instantaneous hamiltonian by bogoliubov transformation . in the third section we present the view of modified gravity about particle production and also quantum effects near the big rip are analysed . in the fourth section",
    "the equivalence between the total entropy of the universe and the cv formula is checked and an analysis of the quantum effects on cv formula terms near the singularity is also investigated .",
    "the conclusions and perspectives are presented in the final section .",
    "let @xmath15 denotes a scalar field of mass m , and @xmath16 the scale factor for spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic frw spacetime with conformal line element @xmath17 the lagrangian density for this massive scalar field minimally coupled with the gravitational field in a conformal spacetime reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 is minkowski metric .",

    "in general , the field may be decomposed into many different complete set of modes and each of these has its own vacuum state .",
    "suppose we label one such set of modes as @xmath40 .",
    "then , in terms of these modes the field is @xmath41\\quad,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the vacuum state is defined by @xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",

    "because of completeness , the two sets of modes @xmath48 and @xmath49 are related by the bogolubov transformations that diagonalize the hamiltonian i.e. , @xmath50 , satisfying the relation @xmath51 with the normalization condition @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are constants and called bogolubov coefficients .",
    "one can compare the two vacuum states by noting that the number operator for the barred states is @xmath55 .",
    "taking its expectation value with respect to the unbarred vacuum , one finds @xmath56 thus , the number of barred particles in the unbarred vacuum in the mode @xmath43 is @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , the number of unbarred particles in the barred vacuum in the mode @xmath43 is @xmath57 .",
    "since the diagonalization imposes @xmath50 , using ( [ vincent12 ] ) with @xmath24 replaced by @xmath47 , we get @xmath58 substituting this result in the expression of @xmath59 , we get @xmath60 using ( [ vincent11 ] ) and ( [ vincent15 ] ) we obtain @xmath61 and consequently @xmath62 ) and ( [ vincent19 ] ) one can rewrite ( [ vincent21 ] ) as @xmath63 ) .    now , to calculate @xmath64 we have to find @xmath65 from ( [ vincent5 ] ) and @xmath66 from ( [ vincent18 ] ) , but this will be done explicitly in the next section where we will analyse the particle creation phenomenon when the scalar field is minimally coupled with the modified gravity .    with the metric ( [ vincent1 ] ) the einstein equation leads to friedmann ones as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the energy density and the pressure respectively , and @xmath70 . we suppose that they are related by a barotropic equation of state such that @xmath71 with @xmath7 the barotropic parameter . combining eqs .",
    "( [ vincent23 ] ) , ( [ vincent24 ] ) and ( [ vincent25 ] ) , one obtains for the scale factor @xmath72 for the conformal time and @xmath73 for the cosmic time .",
    "our goal is to analyse particle creation phenomenon in f(r ) gravity and check its impact as quantum effects on a possible appearance of singularities in the classical background when this is essentially driven by a dark fluid .",

    "then , even when there is no energy density for usual matter , there exists a kind of fluids called dark fluids @xcite .",

    "their result is that , in the context of modified gravity , the scale factor in radiative universe behaves as whose of de - sitter universe in einstein gravity which would lead to particle creation and consequence implies that parker s result is valid only in the context of general relativity .",

    "we see clearly through ( [ vincent56 ] ) that particle production can be known at any time and also the initial vacuum condition is correctly reproduced at early time where there is no particle production .",
    "then , as the conformal time grows , particle creation becomes important .",

    "the evolution of the particle production rate for a @xmath14\\frac{1}{2},1[$ ] is presented in fig 1 .",
    "we will see later that this behaviour of particle production rate has an effective impact on the singularity .",

    "it is a question that requires an analysis of many details of the evolution of the universe .",

    "the scale factor is normalized so that it equals @xmath181 at present .",

    "hence the energy densities due to quantum effects and the dark fluid become comparable when @xmath183 this may allow estimation of how much the scale factor has increased from today till the equality moment .",
    "normalizing the present scale factor to unity and re - expressing it in terms of the cosmic time , we have @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the present cosmic time and @xmath186 the singularity time . using the estimates made before , we find that the energy densities equal at @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the equality time .",
    "hence , typically , the energy density due to quantum effects begins to dominate a fraction of the present age of the universe before the singularity .",
    "we conclude that it is sufficient to lead to big rip avoidance .",
    "so , quantum effects prevent the divergence which would occur about the energy density and pressure of the dark fluid as the singularity is approached and make them finite .",
    "this can be interpreted as a change of dynamical regime .",
    "as we told above , the case @xmath108 , the starobinsky s model , must be analysed separately . then , using directly the equation ( [ vincent46 ] ) without any ansatz about the explicit expression of the scale factor , one obtains @xmath189 whose general solution can not be found analytically .",
    "however , one can observe two particular solutions , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , which can lead to a constant scale factor . with a constant hubble parameter , the energy density and the pressure of the dark fluid are finite and then , there is no finite time future singularity .",
    "this result agrees with that obtained by bamba and collaborators where they shown that the model @xmath192 naturally removes finite time singularity @xcite .",
    "this section is devoted to the application of the cv formula to the dark fluid characterising the main contain of the universe .",
    "note that the general approach to cv formula has already been done extensively for an ideal fluid in @xcite .",
    "they derived cv formula - like which relates the entropy of the closed frw universe to its energy , and casimir energy , for a multicomponent coupled fluid where the generalized fluid obeys an inhomogeneous equation of state , both for einstein and modified gravities .",
    "it has been explicitly shown as special result that when the equation of state is a linear one and the barotropic parameter @xmath193 ( the radiative universe ) , the cv formula is recovered from the total entropy of the universe .",
    "also , the recovery of the cv formula from friedmann equations has been investigated in our early work @xcite with einstein gravity context , where the inhomogeneous equation of state contains a variable cosmological terms .",
    "the interesting case to be investigated here is the recovery of cv formula from the total entropy of the universe with an ideal fluid with inhomogeneous equation of state .",
    "as we know that the classical background goes toward a big rip , an analysis will be done around the singularity about cv formula terms .",
    "looking at the equation ( [ vincent43 ] ) , it clear that it is an inhomogeneous one .",
    "then , as has been done in @xcite , one can put it in general on the form @xmath194 and the conservation law for the energy , @xmath195 where @xmath6 is the space dimension , becomes , using ( [ vincent69 ] ) @xmath196 the general solution of ( [ vincent71 ] ) is @xmath197 where @xmath198 is an integration constant .",
    "identifying ( [ vincent43 ] ) with ( [ vincent71 ] ) , one gets @xmath199 and consequently , @xmath200 . making use of ( [ vincent45 ] ) and setting @xmath201",
    ", one gets @xmath202 hence , the total energy in the volume @xmath203 behaves as @xmath204 , which is also the behaviour of the extensive and sub - extensive energies .",
    "assuming the conformal invariance , one can write the extensive and sub - extensive ( the casimir energy ) parts of the total energy as @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath207 , and @xmath208 the total entropy of the universe",
    ". then the total entropy of the universe is @xmath209^{-\\frac{n}{g(\\alpha)+1}}\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , we see that the cv formula is recovered for @xmath210 , which means that the dimension of the spacetime may be @xmath211 . then , @xmath212 has to take only discrete values . solving the equation @xmath213 ,",
    "one finds two value for the parameter @xmath2 , @xmath214 then , it appears that cv formula may always be recovered from the total entropy of the universe in einstein gravity .",
    "however , this occurs in f(r ) gravity only for @xmath215 . on the other hand",
    "it is important to note that for either einstein or f(r ) gravity , if @xmath216 , cv formula can not be recovered .",
    "let us now analyse what happens about cv formula terms around the big rip singularity .",
    "note that the cv formula is reproduced for @xmath217 , then , the casimir energy is inversely proportional to the scale factor .",
    "we find then an interesting result that , in an expanding universe , the casimir energy decreases and as the singularity ( big rip ) time is approached , the scale factor diverges and consequently the casimir energy vanishes .",
    "this result is in agreement with the brevik and collaborators s result where they shown that either with viscous or non - viscous fluid the casimir effect fades away near the big rip @xcite . on the other hand , when we put @xmath218 on the form @xmath219 , it appears evidently that it is less that @xmath220 and then must belong to @xmath221 .",
    "hence the cv formula is reproduced only when the big rip can not be avoided .",
    "we studied particle creation aspect in f(r ) gravity in which we considered the assumption @xmath222 . note that particle creation is directly connected with the curvature of the universe .",
    "when the curvature vanishes , the modes are not affected by gravitational field and particle creation phenomenon can not hold .",
    "this aspect is realized when we considered a massless scalar field in a radiative universe . also in a static universe where the scalar remains constant at any time , the curvature vanished and particle creation can not be expected . note that these situation appears clearly when the field equation is put on the form of an harmonic oscillator equation .",
    "the frequency depends on the wave number @xmath223 and on the effective mass .",
    "then , the gravitational field effect through the curvature is incorporated in the effective mass .",
    "consequently , when the curvature grows , the effective mass does not vanish and the particle production can hold , at least when the mass is considered and/or the coupling is not conformal .",
    "it appears that particle creation consequently is linked with the behaviour of the scale factor .",
    "we found then that the scale factor does not change in the f(r ) gravity with respect to his form in einstein gravity and consequently the particle production aspect is the same as in einstein gravity .",
    "we considered that the main content of the universe is a dark fluid and then the universe may evolve toward a finite time singularity , the big rip .",
    "we then analysed quantum effects near this singularity comparing the classical energy density and the pressure of the dark fluid with the renormalized energy density and the pressure due to quantum effects .",
    "hence , we find that for @xmath224\\frac{1}{2 } , 1[$ ] the ratio of the renormalized energy density due to quantum effects to the classical energy density of the dark energy diverges as the big rip is approached . we conclude that quantum effect are dominant near the singularity and the big rip may be avoided . for @xmath225 ,",
    "the ratio goes do zero as the big rip is approached .",
    "this means that the dark fluid is the dominant component of the universe near the singularity and we conclude in this case that the big rip can not be avoided .",
    "the starobinsky s model has been analysed separately and reveals the absence of singularity",
    ".    however , due to the fact that power law expansion for the scale factor presents restriction on starobinsky model , it would be interesting to use an exponential solution and incorporating conformal anomaly as quantum effects around the big rip .",
    "also , in the case for which the singularity is not avoided , it would be interesting to allow the cosmic fluid to possess viscosity for analysing the possible avoidance of this singularity .",
    "we propose to address these investigations in a future work .",
    "another interesting point to which we devoted our attention in this work is the equivalence between the cv formula and the generalized total entropy of the universe , coming from the inhomogeneous equation of state that appears in the f(r ) gravity .",
    "we found that the cv formula can always be recovered in einstein gravity while in f(r ) gravity this equivalence holds only for @xmath5 corresponding to the situation in which the big rip can not be avoided .",
    "we also analysed the behaviour of cv formula terms and found that as the universe expands , the casimir energy decreases and fades away as the big rip is approached .    *",
