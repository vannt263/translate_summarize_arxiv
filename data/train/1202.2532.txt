    "operational risk ( or ) is defined as `` the risk of [ financial ] loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes , people and systems or from external events '' , including legal risk , but excluding strategic and reputation linked risks .",
    "the previous definition is taken from the new basel capital accord or basel ii @xcite , which can be viewed as the turning point for the or management within banking institutions .",
    "in fact basel ii considers or to be a critical risk factor .",
    "the accord requires banks to cope with or by setting a side a certain capital charge , and it proposes three methods for calculating it .    the first method is the basic indicator approach ( bia ) that sets that capital to the @xmath0 of the bank s gross income .",
    "the second is the standardized approach ( sta ) , which is a simple generalization of the bia : the percentage of the gross income is different for each business line and goes from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . the bia and the sta share the fundamental drawback that , because of their inherent assumption that the capital charge is only a linear function of the bank s gross income ( per business line ) , they seem not to be solidly founded .",
    "moreover , they give no additional insight into the dynamics governing the production of operational losses and thus they do not indicate any strategies for lowering them : in other words they do not offer a path toward or management @xcite .",
    "the third method is the advanced measurement approach ( ama ) which allows each bank to develop a model of its own that has to satisfy certain requirements and has to be approved by the national regulatory institutions . in particular , all the amas are required to use a historical database of internal and external losses . however , because the interest in or is recent , and because only small , and sometimes unreliable databases of operational losses exist , the assessments of domain experts must also be considered .",
    "in addition , every ama has to respect the classification of losses in eight business lines ( like the stas ) and by seven different event types .",
    "usually all the amas identify the capital charge with the value - at - risk ( var ) over the time horizon of one year and with a confidence level of @xmath3 , defined as the maximum potential loss not to be exceeded in one year with a confidence level of @xmath3 , i.e. the 99.9 percentile of the loss distribution .",
    "the var has a straightforward interpretation : the probability of registering a loss that is higher than the var in one year is equal to 0.001 and thus such a loss is registered on average every 1000 years .",
    "probably the most widely used ama is the loss distribution approach ( lda ) , which calculates the loss distribution separately , modeling the distribution of the number of losses over a certain time horizon ( frequency ) and the distribution of the impact of a single loss ( severity ) for each couple ( business line , event type ) .",
    "the lda relies on two assumptions : that frequency and severity for each couple are independent and that the frequency and severity of a couple are independent of the frequency and severity of all the other couples . from this point of view",
    ", the main defect of the lda is that it completely neglects the correlations that may exist among the different couples .",
    "advanced statistical tools aiming at considering the correlations have been proposed @xcite , but there is still no general consensus regarding their effectiveness .",
    "we believe that there are several advantages in the use of a dynamical model rather than a purely statistical approach such as the lda .",
    "the first one is methodological : in fact , in the context of a purely statistical approach , one has to make assumptions about the shape of a distribution . for the lda , in particular , one has to specify the frequency and severity distributions before their parameters can be fitted .",
    "also , in the case in which the correlations are modeled through copulae , the functional form of the copula is usually specified a priori . on the other hand",
    ", a dynamical model only makes assumptions about the mechanisms underlying the generation of losses and from those assumptions is able to derive the loss distributions .",
    "this also means that the basic features of the loss distributions can not be inserted `` by han '' as in the lda , but they must emerge from the mechanisms that generate the losses instead .",
    "the second advantage is that a dynamical model may account for the different - time correlations . as mentioned previously ,",
    "much effort has been devoted to including the correlations among different couples in the framework of the lda . however , since both frequency and severity distributions do not depend on time , it is not possible to deal with the different - time correlations .",
    "let us provide an example to show why , in the context of or , different - time correlations can not be neglected .",
    "let us suppose , for example , that a failure occurs in the process of machinery servicing at time @xmath4 because of a damage in the transaction control system that is repaired only later at the time @xmath5 . as a consequence , some transactions may fail or be wrongly authorized and generate losses in other processes in the whole time interval @xmath6 $ ] . as it will be shown throughout the paper ,",
    "the third advantage is that , in contrast with static approaches , a dynamical model offers a natural and solid framework to forecast future operational losses .",
    "the model proposed by @xcite is the first attempt to introduce a dynamical model in the context of or .",
    "it can be considered a mixed model in the sense that , while using a dynamical model to derive the frequency distribution , it still uses a static severity distribution . as a consequence ,",
    "all the aforementioned benefits of adopting a dynamical model are limited to the frequency distribution .",
    "the model that we are proposing is completely dynamical in the sense that the relevant variable is the amount of loss registered in each couple at a certain time , avoiding the description in terms of frequency and severity .",
    "indeed , frequency and severity distributions are simply a statistical tool for calculating the loss distributions and , while effective in a static approach , it is difficult to claim that the mechanisms generating losses directly involve them .",
    "the equation of motion includes two different mechanisms accounting for the generation of operational losses : the spontaneous generation via a random noise and the generation resulting from the interaction between different couples .",
    "the possibility that the bank will invest some money to avoid the occurrence of losses is also taken into account .",
    "the aim of this paper is to set a new viable framework for a dynamical approach to or .",
    "this means that we will try to build a basic dynamical model and find out how its crucial advantages over the purely statistical approaches can be exploited . in particular , it will be shown how the parameters of the model can be estimated from a database of operational losses or assessed by domain experts so that the model can be conveniently tailored to a specific bank . since the main reason to study a dynamical approach is to try to understand whether , at least in principle , it is able to forecast future operational losses , we test the forecasting power of the model by choosing a realistic set of parameters .",
    "as we have already noted , using a dynamical approach implies that one can not easily impose specific features on the loss distributions a priori : in particular , one can not rely on the severity distribution to induce heavy tails in the loss distribution , as is the case in @xcite .",
    "after the preliminary exploration of the potential of the model that we perform in this paper , the next step should be to establish some solid connections between the regions of the parameter space and the desirable features of the loss distributions .",
    "we will merely hint at the important role played by the random noise , like some recent papers @xcite suggest .",
    "we conclude with a final remark regarding the degrees of freedom of the model .",
    "it is very unlikely that the actual dynamics that causes the occurrence of operational losses in a bank directly involves the 56 couples indicated by basel ii : this would imply that the relevant variables for the dynamics of production of operational losses were the same for all the banks , regardless of their organizational structure .",
    "for this reason we prefer to introduce a further level of abstraction and just call processes the degrees of freedom of our model , implicitly assuming that they strongly vary from bank to bank and , therefore , that they should be carefully identified by a pool of experts in the internal structure of the bank .",
    "in the proposed model we associate with each process a positive real valued variable @xmath7 representing the amount of monetary loss incurred at the time @xmath8 in the @xmath9-th process . there is one strong motivation to force @xmath7 to assume only positive values : our aim is to learn ( at least ) some of the parameters of the model from a database of historical operational losses collected by a bank whose entries are all positive , i.e. the quantities that are meant to be observed are intrinsically positive .",
    "we point out that negative values of @xmath7 could be interpreted as temporary reserves of money put aside to automatically lower the future losses ; forcing @xmath7 to assume only positive values we are excluding this possibility .",
    "the evolution of the variables is governed by the following discrete time equation of motion : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of processes and the ramp function : @xmath12 ensures that @xmath7 remains positive for all the time steps . from eq .",
    "[ eq : motion ] we see that the positive terms in the argument of the ramp function aim to generate a loss , while the negative terms aim to avoid the occurrence of a loss .",
    "@xmath13 is the number of nonzero losses occurred in the @xmath9-th process in the time interval @xmath14 $ ] : @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the heaviside function and @xmath17 is an integer , so that @xmath13 ranges from 0 to @xmath17 .",
    "[ eq : trigger ] also contains a clear definition of the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "in fact @xmath7 depends on @xmath18 , meaning that @xmath17 is the maximum delay up to which the losses incurred in the @xmath19-th process may influence the losses in the @xmath9-th process . in this sense",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is interpreted as the maximum correlation time between the losses incurred in the @xmath9-th and the @xmath19-th process ; however it should be kept in mind that those correlation times ( and thus @xmath17 ) are not symmetrical in general .",
    "let us now comment the role of each term in the argument of the ramp function in eq .",
    "[ eq : motion ] . the sum term in eq .",
    "[ eq : motion ] accounts for the potential generation of losses due to the interactions with other processes : if @xmath20 , then the @xmath9-th process is influenced by the @xmath19-th process and , in particular , if @xmath21 , each loss occurred in the time interval @xmath14 $ ] ( counted by @xmath13 ) generates a loss of amount @xmath21 in the @xmath9-th process at the time @xmath8 .",
    "as an example , let us suppose that @xmath22 and that @xmath23 , @xmath24 ; from eqs .",
    "[ eq : motion ] and [ eq : trigger ] we see that the sum term for the first process may assume the values @xmath25 depending on the number of nonzero losses that occur in the second process in the time interval @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "this means that each loss that occurs in the second process in this time interval generates a potential loss of amount @xmath27 in the first process . as previously explained , @xmath28 is the maximum correlation time between the losses incurred in the second and in the first process .",
    "the losses incurred in the second process before the time @xmath29 have no influence on what may happen to the first process at the time @xmath8 .",
    "obviously this is also true for the losses occurred after the time @xmath30 , i.e. in the future with respect to the time @xmath8 .",
    "if the condition @xmath23 , @xmath24 does not hold , the effect of the other processes must be summed to the effect of the second process . also the @xmath31 are not symmetrical in general : in fact the effect on the @xmath9-th process of a loss incurred in the @xmath19-th process is clearly different from the effect on the @xmath19-th process of a loss incurred in the @xmath9-th process .    in this context , the parameters @xmath17 play a crucial role in accounting for different - time correlations and extending the model proposed in @xcite , where the status of the @xmath9-th process depends only on the value of the variables at the time @xmath30 . if the length of the time step of the model is larger than the maximum correlation time among the losses incurred in two different processes , eq .",
    "[ eq : motion ] provides a much more realistic description than the equation of motion proposed in @xcite .",
    "in such a context the length of a time step is the typical time scale of the mechanisms responsible for generating the losses and , as it will be shown in section [ sec : parameters_est ] , it is linked to the temporal resolution of the database of operational losses that is used to estimate the parameters of the model .",
    "@xmath32 can have two very different interpretations depending on its sign .",
    "if @xmath33 , it can be interpreted as the investment the bank makes to avoid the occurrence of losses in the @xmath9-th process : the greater the value of @xmath34 , the less likely it is that a potential loss due to the other terms becomes an actual loss .",
    "since @xmath32 does not depend on time , the amount of money ( per unit of time ) the bank chooses to invest on each process is fixed a priori rather than dynamically tuned .",
    "if @xmath35 , it can interpreted as pathological tendency of the @xmath9-th process to produce a loss of amount @xmath32 at each time step .",
    "@xmath36 is a @xmath37-correlated random noise that accounts for spontaneously generated losses , i.e. losses not caused by the interactions with other processes .",
    "because of its interpretation , its probability density function should have a subset of @xmath38 as support .",
    "we have chosen the exponential distribution : @xmath39 where @xmath40 can be interpreted as the inverse of the mean value of the spontaneous losses that can be produced in the @xmath9-th process .",
    "the exponential distribution has the property that about @xmath41 of its random extractions are lower than its mean value .",
    "this means that only few of the extraction will be able to exceed the threshold ( unless it is chosen to be less than the mean value ) .",
    "this behavior seems to capture the intuitive picture of a spontaneous loss , which is something that is rarely expected to happen .",
    "we point out that in the context of or the crucial quantity is the cumulative loss up to the time @xmath8 : @xmath42 which can be taken as an indicator of how much money the bank has to put aside to face or over a time horizon @xmath8 .",
    "let us note that such a time horizon is expressed here in units of time steps , meaning that , supposing that one is interested in the distribution of the cumulative losses registered in one year , @xmath8 in eq .",
    "[ eq : zeta ] is equal to one year divided by the length of a time step .",

    "this means that the information contained in last quarter of time steps is redundant and that the first three - quarters of the available time steps can provide all the information needed to perform a reliable estimation of the parameters .",
    "this is a very general consideration indeed : every time we want to make a forecast about some quantity we are assuming that our knowledge about its dynamics is complete , i.e. all the relevant information is contained in the past ( already observed ) evolution .",

    "the lighter transparent region has the same meaning for the average of @xmath77 obtained estimating the parameters only from the first three - quarters of the available time steps .",
    "we see that , in all the cases , the original trajectory is reproduced with an error which is less than ( or , for the @xmath97-th process , equal to ) one standard deviation , meaning that the cumulative loss in the last part of the database has been reliably forecast .    in the right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : part_1 ] and [ fig : part_2 ] we compare the full distribution of @xmath96 of the sampled evolutions at point 3 with the original trajectory .",
    "the solid line denotes @xmath96 of the original trajectory , the darker histogram refers to the distribution of @xmath96 obtained estimating the parameters from the whole database , while lighter histogram refers to the distribution of @xmath96 obtained estimating the parameters only from the first three - quarters of the available time steps .",
    "again we see that peaks of both distributions are very close and almost coincident with the value of the original trajectory .",
    "we note that the observed average of @xmath77 is , by a good approximation , linear and that the distribution of @xmath96 does not seem to exhibit heavy tails .",
    "such a behavior is also present in the process 2 , which is not influenced by the losses incurred in any other process and whose losses can only have been spontaneously generated by the noise term .",
    "this observation encourages us to explore models in which the distribution of the noise has a different shape and heavy tails .",
    "however , it should be also kept in mind that deviations from the behavior shown here may depend not only on the distribution of the noise , but also on the chosen parameters .",
    "as already pointed out in section [ sec : intro ] , a further exploration of the parameter space is certainly needed to understand if this peculiarity depends on the particular choice of parameters that has been made .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a new dynamical model for or . to the best of our knowledge for the first time",
    "the loss distribution is derived from an entirely dynamical approach . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "such an approach was limited to the frequency distribution .",
    "the use of a dynamical approach has a great methodological advantage over static approaches .",
    "for example , the lda uses historical data to fit the yearly loss distribution and , exploiting this distribution to estimate the capital charge for the next year , the method implicitly assumes that the distribution will not change from one year to the next . on the other hand , a dynamical approach provides a natural framework for forecasting the distribution of the future losses on which the capital charge requirements should be based , making the much weaker assumption that only the basic mechanisms of loss production do not change from year to year",
    ". indeed , also this assumption may be partially relaxed by estimating the parameters only from the most recent part of a database of operational losses or by forcing them to values assessed by a domain experts .",
    "however , we point out that , since the meaning of the parameters of the model is unconventional in the context of or , such an assessment must be carried out with extreme care , so that the experts can be completely aware of the role played by each parameter in the model",
    ". another crucial feature of the proposed approach that is absent in most of the amas is that it can take into account different - time correlations among the processes by means of the interaction term in the equation of motion .",
    "let us remark that the current implementation adheres to many of the ama guidelines : i ) some parameters of the model are estimated from a database of internal operational losses , ii ) the remaining parameters have to be assessed by domain experts , iii )",
    "the processes can be considered to be , or can be linked to , the 56 ( business lines , event types ) couples , iv ) the var of the cumulative loss distribution at every time step can be calculated with the desired level of confidence ; the calculation of the var over the time horizon of one year can be performed once the fictional time scale the model is linked to some real time scale , which may be the time resolution of the available database of operational losses .",
    "it is worth noting that the proposed model does not require massive investments for its implementation .",
    "in fact , only a reliable monitoring of the internal losses and the assessments of internal experts are needed .",
    "both of these things are requirements that every ama - oriented bank should meet in any case . from a practical point of view",
    "the main steps required to implement the proposed approach are the following : i ) the processes should be identified , since ( as hinted in [ sec : intro ] ) they may strongly depend on the specific bank ; ii ) the losses incurred in the processes have to be monitored for a sufficient amount of time , so that a reliable database of operational losses can be built and iii ) the parameters that can not be estimated from the database must be assessed by domain experts",
    ".    the current limitations of the model pave the way for future research directions .",
    "a recent paper @xcite has focused on the case in which no causal loops among the processes exist , showing that , together with @xmath32 and @xmath31 , even the parameter @xmath40 can be learned from a database of operational losses in that case .",
    "we point out that the absence of causal loops is an hypothesis that is often accepted . in particular",
    "this is the crucial hypothesis of all the approaches based on bayesian networks @xcite . in this case",
    "the loss distribution has been analytically derived as well , establishing a deep connection between the properties of the noise in the equation of motion and the shape of the loss distribution .",
    "we have already discussed the importance of investigating the case in which the distribution of the noise has heavy tails .",
    "@xcite deals with such distributions , generalizing the results obtained in @xcite and proving that , at least in the case in which there are no causal loops , the distribution of the cumulative loss is heavy tailed if and only if the distribution of the noise is heavy tailed .",
    "further research should be certainly devoted to investigating the more general case in which causal loops are present .",
