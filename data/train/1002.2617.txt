    "since the launch in june 2008 , the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) onboard _ fermi _ detected over 300 gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) , 12 of which were detected and studied above 100 mev with the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) .",
    "the gbm enables grb spectroscopy from 8 kev to 40 mev , and the standard lat analysis is performed using events of energies above 100 mev only .",
    "here we propose a non - standard lat analysis which allows to recover the prompt emission from grb between @xmath030 mev and 100 mev , joining the two instruments energy ranges .",
    "this so - called lat low - energy ( lle ) technique also improves the photon statistics above 100 mev , and will allow us to better define the grb prompt emission spectral characteristics .",
    "it is important to note that this analysis is based on non - public data and software , and is still under improvement and calibration at the time of this proceeding .",
    "section  [ sect2 ] describes the lle technique objectives and principles .",
    "peformances studies are presented in section  [ sect3 ] .",
    "preliminary re - analyses of the bright grb 080916c and grb 090510 are presented in section  [ sect4 ] .",
    "the lat standard analysis is based on a sophisticated reconstruction and classification procedure @xcite .",
    "the probability for each event to be a photon is estimated using the event topology and the reliability of its reconstruction .",
    "the characteristcs of the particle backgrounds below 100 mev is still under study and makes this classification more complicated .",
    "moreover , the lat effective area suffers from systematic effects which are not well determined yet in this energy range .",
    "although the standard lat analysis currently starts at 100 mev , public datasets and responses should allow for analyses starting at energies lower than 100 mev for any kind of source in the future .",
    "on the one hand , faint or soft grb emissions ( e.g. bin a of grb 090510 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:090510_prompt_sed ] ) are not detected so far above 100 mev , while they can exhibit additional components which become dominant above few tens of mev .",
    "their signal above this energy can be rejected by the usual quality selections or be intrinsically too faint .",
    "an improved spectral analysis above 40 mev would reveal any kind of feature , e.g. a faint additional component , a cutoff , or a simple power - law behaviour .",
    "the use of the present technique should improve the statistics above 100 mev as well , although it is not yet clear whether it will substabtially improve the sensitivity of the spectral analysis .    on the other hand ,",
    "bright spectra ( e.g. bin b to d of grb 090510 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:090510_prompt_sed ] , or grb 080916c  @xcite ) are currently reconstructed above 100 mev .",
    "adding a lat low - energy signal to the available standard dataset would help to better constrain the spectral parameters of such features ( see section  [ sect4 ] ) .",
    "the lle technique makes use of the analysis software rmfit , which is commonly used for all gbm spectral and temporal analyses .",
    "it consists of the forward - folding analysis of a background - subtracted binned event rate , using a detector response matrix ( drm ) for model - folding ( fig .",
    "[ fig : drm_spec ] ) .",
    "a temporal selection defines the `` on '' interval containing the emission and the `` off '' interval(s ) used to extrapolate the background rate in the `` on '' interval , in each energy bin ( fig .",
    "[ fig : on_off ] ) .",
    "in contrast with the standard analysis , the lle event selection does not include strict quality criteria .",
    "we consider every event passing the onboard gamma filter  @xcite and for which at least one track could be found in the tracker .",
    "many of these events do not have a reliable direction , therefore no `` region of interest '' can be defined around the source position in the sky . a binning is applied on the measured energy ( see section  [ sect32 ] ) .",
    "once the `` on '' and `` off '' intervals have been selected , the background rate time profile is fitted with a polynomial function in each energy bin , which yields an estimate of the background spectrum in the `` on '' interval .",
    "the background spectrum can vary with time so the `` off '' intervals can not be chosen too far from the `` on '' interval , nor too close nor short to allow for a good fit precision .",
    "the same precautions are usually taken for spectral analyses of gbm data .",
    "the drm is built from a dedicated extensive simulation of a bright point source using the gleam software @xcite .",
    "the observation conditions reproduce those of the grb of interest . in particular , the inclination angle of the source and livetime",
    "should be the same since both affect the effective area .",
    "the lle selections are applied to the dataset produced , the remaining events are binned in true and measured energy . the resulting distribution is converted to area units ( fig .  [",
    "fig : drm_spec ] ) .",
    "the effect of the simulated spectral shape and of the true energy binning on the reconstruction quality are yet under investigation .",
    "the lle selection consists of the onboard gamma filter and the identification of at least one track in the tracker .",
    "this latter criterion ensures a better correlation between the true and measured energy ( see section  [ sect32 ] ) .",
    "these relaxed selections greatly improve the photon statistics at low energies with respect to the standard pass6 `` transient class '' quality selections , and improve the statistics at high energies as well , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : efficiency ] : the effective area is increased by a factor of @xmath050 at 30 mev , 4.5 at 100 mev , and still by more than a factor 2 above 1 gev .      .",
    "lle energy measurement resolution for simulated photons of inclination angle @xmath140@xmath2 ( top ) or 40@xmath370@xmath2 ( bottom ) .",
    "energies are in mev .",
    "true energy @xmath4 lines of width 4 mev were selected .",
    "the resolution is here defined as rms/@xmath5e@xmath6 and the error as ( @xmath5e@xmath6 - e@xmath7)/e@xmath7 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to study the reconstruction capabilities of the lle technique , a bright grb was simulated as a point source with a simple power - law spectrum : @xmath8 .",
    "no background was added to the data and this spectrum was analyzed using the standard tool xspec ( heasarc ) .",
    "the reconstruction was performed using only the standard pass6 transient data ( above 100 mev ) , or using both the lle ( 30 mev to 100 mev ) and pass6 transient data .",
    "both reconstructions yield similar results ( table  [ tab : sim_080916c ] ) , with a smaller uncertainty on the index @xmath9 when using lle data .",
    "a systematic error yet appears , which will be investigated after the technique has been fully calibrated .",
    "new analyses of two bright bursts were performed and yield encouraging results .",
    "grb 080916c time - integrated spectrum was fitted using only gbm and standard transient events ( above 100 mev ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ana_080916c ] ) . the lle dataset was added but not used for the fit .",
    "the good residuals in the lle energy range ( 30 mev  100 mev ) show the good agreement between this technique and the standard procedure .",
    "grb 090510 time - integrated spectrum was fitted using all datasets : gbm , lat pass6 transient , lle .",
    "a band function with an additional power - law component yields the best fit , like in the standard analysis @xcite .",
    "the high - energy component is more significant when using lle data ( @xmath10 = 8.9 instead of 5.6 without lle ) .",
    "the spectral evolution observed in this bright burst s prompt emission will certainly better show up if the lle data are used in the time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "the lle technique presented here can be used in principle for any kind of flaring source : grb prompt emission , axp , pulsars ( see @xcite for details ) , etc .",
    "the validation study of these analyses is yet still ongoing ( acceptance and energy calibration , systematics effects ) .",
    "the reconstruction of a simulated spectrum has shown a bias , such effects have to be characterized and understood .",
    "the performances that are yet measured from sets of simulated photons have to be confronted to data , e.g. using vela on - pulse emission as a pure sample of real photons .",
