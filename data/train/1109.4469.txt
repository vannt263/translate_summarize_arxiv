    "we were able to ensure that the target waveguide mode was coupled with high rate , selectivity , and overlap with the target gaussian mode .",
    "this perturbative photonic crystal waveguide coupler ( ppcwc ) not only enables efficient scattering of selected waveguide modes , but also allows modifications in the shape and the direction of scattering .",
    "the angle of the scattered field can be shifted by detuning the mode frequency with respect to the lattice constant or introducing some modulation to the perturbation size . by breaking the vertical symmetry of the pc or using reflectors under the pc slab ,",
    "it is possible to minimize downward propagation , directing most vertical scattering upward .",
    "the ppcwc enables a straightforward integration of vertical in / out- couplers which can be employed in a range of application from optical interconnects to photonic crystal light sources .",
