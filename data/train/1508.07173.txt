    "a three - dimensional topological insulator ( 3dti ) is an extraordinary material with an insulating band gap but topologically protected gapless surface states .",

    "one has triggered an intense interest in the condensed matter community : the emergence of majorana fermions when tis are in electrical contact with a superconductor @xcite .",
    "indeed , the topological insulator - superconductor system can be used to engineer an effective _ spinless _ triplet superconductor which is expected to host zero - energy topologically protected majorana bound states @xcite .     ( a ) sketch of a normal - superconductor junction on the surface state of a topological insulator ( regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) with an intermediate region @xmath2 modeled as a square potential barrier ( see potential profile ) .",

    "with respect to the exchange of the time ( frequency ) , spin , and spatial ( momentum ) coordinates , the green function can be even ( e ) or odd ( o ) .",
    "the spin part can be divided into a singlet ( s ) or three triplet ( t ) components .",
    "the pauli principle allows for four different combinations ; using a `` frequency / spin / momentum '' notation : ese , oso , eto , and ote . ]    remarkably , the interplay between the spin - momentum locking at the surface of the 3dti , the conventional pair potential from a superconductor , and magnetic order from either a ferromagnet or a magnetic field creates a very exotic induced pair potential in the 3dti .",
    "first , the proximity induced pair potential from a conventional singlet @xmath8-wave superconductor on the surface of a 3dti features a superposition of singlet and triplet states @xcite . owing to the symmetry of cooper pairs , the singlet ( triplet ) components are even ( odd ) under the exchange of the spatial coordinates of the two electrons ( even / odd in momentum ) . at the same time",
    ", they are all even under the exchange of time coordinates ( even in frequency ) .",
    "second , at the interface between normal and superconducting regions inversion symmetry is broken .",
    "such inhomogeneity generates new pairing components that are odd ( even ) in momentum if they are a singlet ( triplet ) state of spin @xcite .",
    "therefore , the pauli principle imposes that these new terms must be odd in frequency .",
    "finally , as we demonstrate in this paper , magnetic order directly affects all these components and opens the possibility for the exotic odd - frequency terms to become dominant and produce strong changes in transport observables of these systems .    among the unconventional components of the pair potential , a new",
    ", very rare type of superconducting condensate can be induced in this system : one with a spin - triplet component that is odd in frequency and even in momentum @xcite . such exotic _",
    "odd - frequency triplet pairing _ has been proposed to explain the long - range proximity effect observed in superconductor - ferromagnet hybrids @xcite . on such systems",
    ", the odd - frequency triplet component can be filtered from the rest of induced components of the superconducting condensate since it is the only one resistant to disorder . in topological systems ,",
    "spin - polarization can be used to detect this unconventional pairing .",
    "recently , crpin _ et al .",
    "_ have proposed a detection scheme based on nonlocal conductance measurements on the one - dimensional edge of a two - dimensional ti @xcite . moreover ,",
    "odd - frequency triplet pairing and the emergence of majorana bound states are related : any system that supports majorana zero - energy bound states also develops an odd - frequency spin - triplet component of the pair potential @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider hybrid systems between 3dti and superconductors like the one sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch](a ) .",
    "we study the proximity effect when such systems are exposed to a magnetization extended over the whole junction .",
    "the magnetization can be induced by proximity to a ferromagnetic material ( b ) or by an external magnetic field ( c ) .",
    "previous works on 3dti - based normal - superconductor ( ns ) and josephson ( sns ) junctions focused only on transport signatures of such hybrids and the conditions for the formation of majorana bound states @xcite . here",
    ", we study the interplay between topological order and superconducting correlations performing a symmetry analysis of the induced pair potential based on the anomalous green function . we go beyond previous works @xcite by including the effect of the magnetization on the superconducting electrode @xcite .    in the absence of magnetization , singlet and triplet",
    "components of the pair potential with even and odd frequency dependences are created at the ti - superconductor interface .",
    "however , the even - frequency singlet component is dominant and no low - energy states are formed @xcite . for finite magnetization ,",
    "the odd - frequency triplet components can become dominant , resulting in a rich subgap structure with emerging low - energy peaks .",
    "we study their effect on the nis conductance , with i an intermediate region , and the local density of states ( ldos ) for two orientations of the magnetization : in- and out - of - plane . for the latter ,",
    "when the strength of the magnetization approaches the magnitude of the chemical potential in the superconductor , the odd - frequency triplet component becomes stronger than the singlet one .",
    "consequently , a zero - energy peak emerges in the nis conductance .",
    "we find the same behavior for in - plane case with strength comparable to the superconducting gap and oriented parallel to the nis interface . when the in - plane magnetization is oriented differently , the rotational invariance of the band structure is broken . as a consequence ,",
    "the nis conductance becomes asymmetric with the energy ; a feature completely different to previous works based on ferromagnet - superconductor junctions on 3dtis @xcite . independently of the orientation of the in - plane magnetization , when its strength is comparable to the superconducting gap , the odd - frequency triplet component becomes similar to or bigger than the singlet one .",
    "consequently , subgap resonances are present in the ldos and nis conductance .",

    "in the appendix , we describe our method to compute the retarded green function and the transport observables that we examine .",
    "in our setup , the surface of a 3dti extends along the @xmath4-@xmath9 plane .",

    "the role of the intermediate region is to include any interface scattering between the normal and the superconducting regions .",

    "we describe two situations where we can neglect the spatial dependence of @xmath6 and regard it as constant .",
    "the effect of a uniform constant @xmath6 has the same form as a zeeman interaction where the vector potential plays the role of an exchange field .",

    "the main difference with previous works @xcite is that magnetic order is induced in the whole junction and is not just limited to an intermediate region .",
    "we consider this a sensible approach to describe 3dti hybrid junctions where proximity - induced superconductivity on the two - dimensional surface state can be sensitive to magnetic effects . with our choice of the reference frame ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) , the momentum component parallel to the interface @xmath37 is conserved .",

    "a full list of the scattering states for this junction is presented in appendix [ sec : app1 ] .",
    "next , we provide the main results for two different orientations of the effective magnetization @xmath40 .",
    "we start by considering an out - of - plane effective magnetization @xmath41 ( see fig .  [",

    "ignoring the spatial dependence of the vector potential is equivalent to assume that the magnetization is a zeeman term with exchange field @xmath5 .    in the superconducting region ,",

    "when both @xmath5 and @xmath48 are finite at the same time , a competition between the superconducting and the magnetic gap occurs . as a result",
    ", a zero - energy state can be created when @xmath49 .",
    "this allows us to define the effective superconducting gap @xmath50 for @xmath51 , the gap is real and superconductivity is the dominant process in the superconducting region . on the other hand ,",
    "superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic gap when @xmath52 .",
    "the critical point between the two regimes is thus @xmath53 .",

    "the effect of the weak field is a shift in the energy , analogous to the doppler shift discussed for a squid - like geometry of helical edge states in ref .  .",
    "using that @xmath67 we can define the effective gaps @xmath68 the critical value for which the effective gap closes is now @xmath69 , which can be reached with rather weak fields .",
    "the magnetic field induces a finite cooper pair ( condensate ) momentum which affects quasiparticles differently depending on their direction of motion . due to the spin - momentum locking at the surface state of the ti ,",

    "<S> the proximity induced pair potential in a topological insulator - superconductor hybrid features an interesting superposition of a conventional spin - singlet component from the superconductor and a spin - triplet one induced by the surface state of the topological insulator . </S>",
    "<S> this singlet - triplet superposition can be altered by the presence of a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we study the interplay between topological order and superconducting correlations performing a symmetry analysis of the induced pair potential , using green functions techniques to theoretically describe ballistic junctions between superconductors and topological insulators under magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we relate a change in the conductance from a gapped profile into one with a zero - energy peak with the transition into a topologically nontrivial regime where the odd - frequency triplet pairing becomes the dominant component in the pair potential . </S>",
    "<S> the nontrivial regime , which provides a signature of odd - frequency triplet superconductivity , is reached for an out - of - plane effective magnetization with strength comparable to the chemical potential of the superconductor or for an in - plane one , parallel to the normal - superconductor interface , with strength of the order of the superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , in the latter case , a misalignment with the interface yields an asymmetry with the energy in the conductance unless the total contribution of the topological surface state is considered . </S>"
