    "recently , checkelsky _ et al .",
    "_ claimed to have isolated the surface band contribution in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 by electrostatic gate control of chemical potential.@xcite nevertheless , this work is questionable for the reason that the chemical potential is still in the bulk conduction band.@xcite theoretically , d. culcer _",
    "_ investigated the two - dimensional surface charge transport and obtained results analogous to the ones of graphene.@xcite recently , kim _ et al . _ showed that the surface of thin bi@xmath0se@xmath1 were electrostatically coupled , strongly.@xcite they observed the surface transport by using a gate electrode to remove bulk charge carriers , completely , and well demonstrated the theoretical prediction.@xcite it is very likely that this experiment has overcome the above obstacle . also , the surface anomalous hall conductivity in ti was calculated using quantum liouville equation.@xcite the electron - phonon scattering limited conductivity was investigated for the surface state of a strong ti.@xcite moreover , the transverse magnetic heat transport was explored on the topological surface.@xcite    on the other hand , recently , the quantum corrections to charge conductivity in topological surface states were also extensively studied.@xcite the surface states in quantum diffusion regime ( @xmath2 ) reveal positive weak localization correction , i.e. weak anti - localization , which is related to the @xmath3 berry phase.@xcite here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the elastic scattering length and the phase coherence length , respectively .",

    "this kind of band structure was explained by fu.@xcite note that the states near the fermi surface are responsible for the transport properties at low temperature .",
    "hence , it is expected that the warping effect will naturally play significant roles on surface transport when the fermi energy is high enough .",
    "so far , only one theoretical work involves the warping effect on the weak anti - localization in the literature.@xcite further , they simply replaced the warping term by its angle average one , hence , the anisotropy of energy spectrum due to warping is neglected , completely .",
    "then they acquired the same form of correction as the usual two - dimensional electron gas with spin - orbital interaction .",
    "consequently , it is highly desirable to carefully study the warping effect on the classical contribution and quantum correction to the surface transport .    in this paper , we study the hexagonal warping effect on the charge conductivity and current - induced spin polarization ( cisp ) in the surface state of a three - dimensional ti . considering nonmagnetic and magnetic elastic carrier - impurity scattering , we discuss this problem both in classical and quantum diffusive regimes .",

    "we note that the tf screening is the long - wavelength limit of rpa dielectric function . at the same time , for finite magnitude of momentum , the rpa screening is weaker than the tf one .",

    "[ feyn ] ( d ) should be taken into account , which are written as @xmath162 different from the topological surface states in the absence of hexagonal warping , the velocity and spin vertex become anisotropic .",
    "this anisotropy is very important and will lead to the density dependence of quantum correction .",
    "note that in the absence of warping the group velocity @xmath163 and average spin @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , for vanishing @xmath9 , the velocity vertex reduces to@xcite @xmath165 .",
    "in addition to the bare hikami box fig . [ feyn ]",
    "( a ) , two dresses hikami boxes fig .",
    "[ feyn ] ( b)-(c ) are also needed in the calculation of quantum corrections and the total corrections of charge conductivity is given by @xmath166 where the quantum correction due to bare hikami box @xmath167 and the quantum corrections due to two dressed hikami boxes @xmath168 here @xmath169 is the scattering amplitude between two eigenstates .",
    "@xmath170 means average over all possible configurations of random impurity .",
    "consequently , for @xmath85-form impurity scattering , @xmath171 .",
    "since the cooperon @xmath172 diverges as @xmath105 , hence the most divergent terms could be obtained by setting @xmath173 for velocity vertex , retarded and advanced green s functions in the above expressions . performing momentum @xmath20 and @xmath174 integrals ,",
    "the total conductivity correction is written as @xmath175 for vanishing @xmath9 , this result is in accordance with the one in ref . .",
    "similarly , the total spin polarization correction is given by @xmath176 the cooperon satisfies the bethe - salpeter equation fig .",
    "[ feyn ] ( e ) @xmath177 where @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and by expanding up to @xmath180 , the bare vertex @xmath181 for small @xmath182 is written as @xmath183 with @xmath184.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression of @xmath185 is long and we do not write it here . for weak",
    "warping , the solution of eq .",
    "is found as @xmath186 .",
    "@xmath187 and @xmath188 are independent of @xmath9 . with the help of the expansion @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath188",
    "are determined by the following equations : @xmath191 @xmath190 can be acquired from eq .",
    "and then we can obtain @xmath188 from eq . .",
    "it is found that @xmath192 relies on @xmath193 through @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 .",
    "hence , @xmath190 and @xmath188 have the forms : @xmath198 the above coefficients @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , and @xmath202 ( @xmath203 , @xmath204 ) are independent of @xmath193 and can be determined by eqs . and .",
    "the derivation is tedious but direct . by setting @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 for small @xmath182 and collecting the most divergent terms ,",
    "finally , the cooperon is obtained as @xmath208 by performing the integration over @xmath182 between @xmath209 and @xmath210 , the logarithmic correction to the conductivity and spin polarization are found as @xmath211 here we have used the relations @xmath212 and @xmath213 with @xmath214 the diffusion constant .",
    "it is useful to rewrite the conductivity correction as @xmath215 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath216 has the form : @xmath217 the hexagonal warping makes the prefactor @xmath216 quadratically depend on the carrier density and is always smaller than @xmath218 , in vivid contrast with the angle - average approximation.@xcite for vanishing warping , this factor becomes @xmath218 , in agreement with the theoretical work.@xcite we note that the above formula is fulfilled for weak warping .",

    "for instance , @xmath220 when @xmath221 .",
    "however , the value of the @xmath216 obtained from fit in recent experiment@xcite is @xmath222 , which is larger than @xmath223 , conflicting with our formula",
    ". this may be due to the inevitable bulk states contribution in three - dimensional tis.@xcite the experimental observation of @xmath216 is a collective result of the surface bands and bulk bands . the bulk channels may result in a weak localization term , which could reduce or even compensate the weak anti - localization arising from the surface states .",
    "therefore , a larger value of @xmath216 is obtained experimentally .",
    "in contrast to the surface bands , the bulk subbands of tis have a quadratic term and large band gaps . as a result , a different density - dependent behavior of quantum correction is expected for the bulk channels .",
    "a quantitative measurement of the carrier - density - dependent surface conductivity correction could be helpful for distinguishing the surface contribution from the bulk one .    in the presence of magnetic scattering , the divergence of @xmath172 when @xmath105 vanishes , which is analogous to the case without warping.@xcite",
    "therefore the logarithmic correction disappears , and it could be deduced that the magnetic scattering suppresses the weak anti - localization effect in the presence of both magnetic and nonmagnetic scattering .",
    "this is in accordance with experimental observation.@xcite",
    "in summary , we have investigated the surface transport of a three - dimensional ti both in classical and quantum diffusive regimes . in this study",
    ", we include the role of the hexagonal warping correction of fermi surface .",
    "it is found that the hexagonal warping has drastic effects on the surface conductivity and cisp of a three - dimensional ti for both nonmagnetic and magnetic elastic scattering . for surface state with large warping , such as bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , an additional quadratic carrier density dependence is found in both two regimes . because the carrier density could be controlled by the gate voltage , hence",
