    "the effects of disorder on the critical properties of statistical models have been the subject of much work in the last decades . in the context of random interactions ,",
    "harris @xcite derived a heuristic criterion to gauge the relevance of uncorrelated disorder to the critical behavior , which is predicted to remain unchanged if the specific - heat exponent @xmath5 of the underlying pure system is negative .",
    "if @xmath6 , disorder becomes relevant and , in the language of the renormalization group ( rg ) , one expects a flow to a new fixed point ( characterized by a nonzero - width fixed distribution of the random variables ) .",
    "it later became clear that the harris criterion must be generalized in a number of situations @xcite , since @xmath5 is not always identifiable with @xmath7 , the crossover exponent of the width of the distribution of the disorder variables .",
    "in particular , random variables correlated along @xmath1 of the @xmath2 spatial dimensions give rise to the scaling relation @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the correlation - length exponent of the pure system . using a real - space rg approach based on numerical calculations @xcite , andelman and aharony @xcite investigated various @xmath0-state potts models with random exchange constants , finding qualitative differences between the cases @xmath4 ( which yields finite - temperature fixed distributions ) and @xmath3 ( which embodies the mccoy - wu model @xcite and yields an `` infinite - disorder '' zero - temperature fixed point ) .",
    "an intuitive illustration of the special role of the @xmath10 case is that , for any infinitesimal concentration of zero bonds ( with a suitable assignment of the random interactions ) , the system would break into non - interacting @xmath11-dimensional structures , and the rg flows would be redirected to the pure fixed point of the corresponding system in @xmath12 dimensions .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use a ( perturbative ) weak - disorder @xcite real - space rg scheme to analyze the critical behavior of @xmath0-state potts models with correlated disordered exchange interactions on various hierarchical lattices , whose exact recursion relations are equivalent to those produced by migdal - kadanoff approximations for bravais lattices . using this weak - disorder scheme ,",
    "we obtain analytical results by truncating the recursion relations for the moments of the disorder distribution ( which are supposed to remain sufficiently small under the rg iterations ) .",
    "all calculations are performed in the vicinity of @xmath13 , in a region where disorder is relevant .",
    "depending on the diference between the dimensionality of the system ( @xmath14 ) and the number of dimensions in which disorder is correlated ( @xmath15 ) , we distinguish two possibilities : ( i ) for @xmath10 , the weak - disorder scheme produces a nonphysical fixed - point probability distribution , characterized by a negative variance , which suggests the existence of a nonperturbative ( `` infinite - disorder '' ) fixed - point ; ( ii ) for @xmath16 , the scheme yields a physically acceptable perturbative fixed - point distribution .",
    "although obtained by an alternative approach , the main results of this paper are in agreement with the numerical findings of andelman and aharony @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",

    "averaging over the random variables we get @xmath35 @xmath36    and corresponding expressions for the higher moments of the deviations .",
    "since @xmath37 is a measure of the distance to the fixed point , it plays the role of temperature . on the other hand , @xmath38 is a measure of the strength of disorder .",
    "the critical behavior of the model is related to the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath39 evaluated at the fixed point .",

    "we point out that , in the vicinity of the point where disorder becomes relevant , the weak - disorder scheme always produces a perturbative random fixed point , but there are two distinct possibilities , depending on the difference between @xmath14 and @xmath15 : ( i ) if @xmath10 , the perturbative fixed point is characterized by a negative variance , and is thus nonphysical , suggesting the existence of another , nonperturbative fixed point ; ( ii ) if @xmath16 , the scheme predicts a physically acceptable perturbative fixed point .",
    "it should be mentioned that this same picture holds for fairly general hierarchical lattices , in particular those with noniterating bonds , as considered by griffiths and kauffman @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the case of the quantum ising model with bond disorder , which corresponds to the extreme - anisotropy limit of the two - dimensional mccoy - wu model ( @xmath10 ) , fisher @xcite was able to obtain a ( presumably exact ) fixed - point probability distribution with infinite variance .",
