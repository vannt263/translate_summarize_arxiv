    "the ads / cft correspondence@xcite has been giving valuable informations for various field theories especially in the strong coupling regions . in particular ,",
    "the correspondence between the classical gravities and the large @xmath1 ( gauge ) field theories has been most intensively studied . among many tests on this correspondence ,",
    "the exactly soluble models in low dimensions , say , the two - dimensional conformal field theories , are expected to shed light .",
    "the relation of ads gravity with the virasoro algebra of cft is based on the pioneering work of brown and henneaux@xcite , and the minimal conformal field theories in two dimensions have been discussed in relation to the ads gravity in three dimensions@xcite . subsequently extensive analyses have been done for the @xmath2 minimal conformal field theories and many evidences are presented for the relevance of the higher spin field theories together with gravity for these minimal models in the large @xmath1 limit@xcite .    as for the recent progress in the stronger statement of the ads / cft correspondence , that is , the correspondence between the `` quantum '' gravity or the string theory and the finite @xmath1 ( gauge ) field theory , the finite @xmath1 effect of the one - dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory with 16 supercharges ( the finite @xmath1 bfss matrix model@xcite ) has been directly examined using the monte carlo simulation@xcite , where the @xmath3-corrections to the type iia supergravity @xcite are reproduced from the gauge theory .",
    "this strongly motivates to regard field theories in some category as candidates of the quantum gravity at least in the semi - classical meaning .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been proposed that the two - dimensional minimal models are holographically dual to three - dimensional quantum gravities . in particular , the simplest minimal model , namely the ising conformal field theory ,",
    "is conjectured to be dual with the three - dimensional euclidean pure quantum gravity .",
    "we here briefly review the argument in ref .",
    "let us consider the three - dimensional quantum gravity with negative cosmological constant .",
    "the `` quantum '' here means that we integrate over all the possible three - dimensional metric . in this path - integral",
    ", the boundary of the three - dimensional geometry is fixed to the 2-torus with the complex structure @xmath0 , and thus the partition function of the gravity is a function of @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "the important fact is that the smooth classical solutions of the three - dimensional pure gravity are restricted to the locally ads geometries , which are obtained by the @xmath5 transformation from the thermal ads geometry .",
    "thus , if we can use the semi - classical approach , the partition function of the quantum gravity is obtained by summing up the classical contributions of each solution with some quantum corrections .",
    "the expansion parameter of the saddle point approximation is the inverse of the quantity , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ads radius and @xmath8 is the newton constant .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 equals to the central charge of the two - dimensional virasoro algebra which appears at the boundary of the asymptotically ads geometry@xcite .",
    "therefore the semi - classical approximation is usually expected to work only for large @xmath9 region .",
    "the most important assumption in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the partition function can be evaluated by summing up the classical geometries even in the strong coupling region , @xmath10 .",
    "once this assumption is accepted , the partition function can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a subgroup of @xmath13 which does not change the topology of the three - dimensional geometry and @xmath14 is the contribution from the thermal ads geometry .",
    "the points are that @xmath14 can be calculated explicitly and that the symmetry @xmath12 is enhanced at specific values of @xmath15 where the summation of ( [ sum gamma ] ) becomes a finite sum .",
    "note that these values exactly equal to the central charges allowed for the two - dimensional minimal models . in particular , when @xmath16 , the partition function of the gravity ( [ sum gamma ] ) reproduces that of the two - dimensional @xmath16 conformal field theory , that is , the ising conformal field theory .",
    "this result suggests the duality between the @xmath16 minimal model and the three - dimensional quantum pure gravity .",
    "this argument actually gives the correspondence between the @xmath16 conformal fixed point of the theory space of the two - dimensional field theory and the three - dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "then it is natural to expect that there will be a gravity description at least in the vicinity of the conformal fixed point in the theory space of the two - dimensional quantum field theories . in the context of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , the renormalization group ( rg ) flow of a coupling constant in the field theory can be identified with the classical trajectory of the corresponding bulk field in the asymptotically ads geometry , which is called the holographic rg @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this scheme ,",
    "the radial coordinate of the ads gravity can be identified with the rg parameter and the ads boundary corresponds to the conformal fixed point . in the case of the ising model , although the conformal fixed point corresponds to the `` quantum '' gravity , we can expect that the central assumption in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , only the classical solutions contribute to the partition function of the quantum gravity , still works at least in the vicinity of the ads solution even after adding an additional field in the bulk theory .",
    "then we can examine the rg structure around the @xmath17 conformal fixed point using the traditional technique of the holographic rg .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to work out the exact solution of the ising model partition function on the lattice corresponding to the torus with the generic complex structure @xmath0 , and study the corresponding holographic rg structure of the continuum theory around the conformal fixed point .",
    "usually the partition function of ising model in two dimensions is obtained for rectangular lattices with the periodic boundary condition , and one obtains the ising conformal field theory on a rectangular torus ( @xmath18 ) by taking the continuum limit at the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "however , the most general torus has a complex structure with the parameter @xmath0 , representing the shape of the torus . in the literature ,",
    "we have found no explicit solution of the ising model partition function on the lattice corresponding to the torus with the generic complex structure , although there have been works to obtain finitized conformal spectrum of ising model on manifold of various topology using corner - transfer matrix , yang - baxter technique , or thermodynamic bethe ansatz@xcite .",
    "we explicitly compute the partition function of the ising model on the twisted lattice , that is , a lattice with such a boundary condition that the `` space '' position is shifted to some amount when one goes around the `` time '' direction , and show that it ends up with the torus with the complex structure in the continuum limit . by taking the continuum limit at off - critical temperature with an appropriate scaling",
    ", we identify the deviation parameter as the mass of the ising conformal field theory on the torus with the complex structure .",
    "we also work out the classical solution of the three - dimensional einstein gravity with a single scalar field .",
    "we find that a simple nonlinear kinetic function and a simple quadratic potential for the scalar field can capture the rg flow from the ising field theory with the central charge @xmath17 at the ultraviolet fixed point towards the @xmath19 case at the infrared by using the technique of the holographic rg via the hamilton - jacobi equation of the gravity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , the partition function of the two - dimensional ising model is obtained on the twisted lattice representing the discretized version of the torus with the complex structure . in section [ sc : continuum ] , the continuum limit of the partition function is obtained retaining the deviation from critical temperature , which results in a mass term for a free majorana fermion . in section [ sc : holgraphicrgflow ] , the holographic description of the renormalization group flow is worked out for the massive majorana fermion in terms of the hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "section [ sc : conclusion_discussion ] is devoted to a summary of our results and a discussion .",
    "some technical details in computing the partition function of the ising model is summarized in appendix [ app : trans ] .",
    "some details of partition function of two - dimensional massive majorana fermion on the torus is given in appendix [ app : massive fermion ] .",
    "let us consider the 2d ising model on a rectangular lattice with the size @xmath20 .",

    "as for the boundary condition , we impose the periodic boundary condition to the space direction and the twisted or shifted boundary condition with an integer parameter @xmath29 to the time direction , namely , the space position is shifted by @xmath30 when one goes around the time direction ( see fig .

    "this means that the continuum limit of the two - dimensional ising model with the boundary condition in eq.([bdr cond ] ) is the two - dimensional massive fermion theory on the torus . in particular",

    "fixing parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123 in eq.([two moduli ] ) which specify the geometry of the torus , the parameter space of the ising model is spanned by @xmath124 , and the procedure of taking the continuum limit is nothing but taking the limit of @xmath102 with fixing @xmath97 . as we have seen , after taking this limit , the parameter @xmath97 is precisely identical to the mass parameter of the two - dimensional massive free fermion and the limit @xmath125 corresponds to the massless majorana fermion , that is , @xmath16 cft .",
    "therefore the flow parametrized by the parameter @xmath97 starting from the conformal fixed point exactly equals to the mass deformation of the @xmath16 cft ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rg flow ] ) .",
    "in this section , we holographically describe the rg flow starting from the conformal fixed point along the parameter @xmath97 .    in the spirit of the ads",

    "the value of the coupling constant of the boundary field theory varies towards infrared ( ir ) as a rg flow . on the other hand ,",
    "the classical solution of the bulk gravity provides a trajectory of the bulk field along the radial direction of an asymptotic ads geometry .",
    "this trajectory is regarded as the rg flow of the coupling constant of the boundary field theory away from a cft at ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the two - dimensional @xmath16 cft is conjectured to be dual to the `` quantum '' pure gravity under the assumption that the path integral over the metric of 3d space - time is localized to the classical solutions , that is , the btz black holes .",
    "we here assume that the same is true at least in the neighborhood of the cft fixed point ; the classical solutions are dominant even in the presence of additional fields in evaluating the partition function of the quantum gravity .    in the analysis of the previous section",
    ", we found that there are two independent flows from the conformal fixed point parametrized by @xmath97 and @xmath126 .",
    "we expect that the parameter @xmath126 in the boundary theory corresponds to certain discretized version of bulk gravity , which is difficult to work out at present . in the following ,",
    "we explore the continuum bulk gravity to study the rg flow of the parameter @xmath97 , which can be identified as the mass of the fermion of the boundary field theory .    since the parameter @xmath97 couples to the operator @xmath127 at the boundary field theory , it is plausible to assume that the corresponding field in the gravity is a real scalar field @xmath128 , which may be considered as the minimum number of degrees of freedom to describe the rg flow of a single parameter @xmath97 .",
    "we thus consider the following action of three dimensional euclidean gravity with a real scalar field @xmath128 ; @xmath129 , \\label{eq : scalar_gravity_action0}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the newton constant of three - dimensional gravity , @xmath130 @xmath131 is the metric , @xmath132 is the ricci scalar , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 is a function of @xmath128 , which describes the nonlinearity of the kinetic term of scalar field @xmath128 .",

    "we have also assumed that the functions @xmath145 and @xmath146 depend only on @xmath147 .",
    "note that we have fixed the gauge by setting @xmath148 in eq.([ansatz1 ] ) . since the geometry is asymptotically anti de sitter space",

    "the evolution of a bulk field along this radial direction is identified with the rg flow of the corresponding coupling constant . in our choice of gauge in eq.([ansatz1 ] ) , the radial coordinate @xmath147 can be identified as the length scale @xmath41 of the two - dimensional boundary field theory .",

    "we observe that the boundary condition of the fermion becomes irrelevant and that the partition function becomes @xmath0-independent when the geometry of the boundary becomes @xmath184 . in this case , the partition function becomes extremely simple and we can expect that every solution gives the same contribution to the partition function even if there are several solutions in the bulk with the same boundary condition .",
    "when the geometry is @xmath184 , the free energy of the massive fermion is given by @xmath185 where @xmath97 is the mass parameter . in order for the free energy in eq.([eq : free_energy_free_massive_fermion ] ) to be well - defined , we need to regularize both uv and ir divergences .",
    "although the result depends on details of the regularization , the regularized free energy in general takes the form @xmath186 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath9 are some constants .    as mentioned above , we regard the scalar field @xmath128 at the boundary as the mass parameter of the boundary fermion and we identify the regularized free energy with the classical action @xmath170 in eq.([classical s ] ) at the boundary which is obtained from the bulk three - dimensional gravity . in addition ,",
    "@xmath176 in eq.([classical s ] ) is proportional to the free energy because @xmath128 does not have @xmath175-dependence .",
    "therefore @xmath176 can be expressed as @xmath187 where @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 are some constants .",
    "using eqs.([eq : w_k_relation ] ) and ( [ eq : w_v_relation ] ) , we can determine @xmath134 and @xmath137 in the following .",
    "suppose @xmath191 , we observe that @xmath176 is dominated by the last term @xmath192 at small values of @xmath128 .",
    "this implies that the rg flow at @xmath193 is discontinuous with the ads solution in eq.([eq : w_k_relation ] ) when @xmath191 .",
    "since we identify the evolution of @xmath128 from @xmath194 to @xmath150 along the radial direction ( the euclidean `` time evolution '' ) as the rg flow from the uv fixed point to ir , this behavior is not acceptable as the rg flow of the mass parameter .",
    "therefore , we should adopt a regularization scheme in the holographic renormalization group by imposing the condition @xmath195 note that the dimensional regularization realizes this condition for example . with this choice of @xmath176",
    ", we obtain @xmath134 and @xmath176 from eq.([eq : w_k_relation ] ) and the normalization condition eq.([eq : normalization_k ] ) , @xmath196 and @xmath197 incidentally , we obtain the @xmath179-function ( [ eq : beta - function ] ) as @xmath198 and the c - function from ( [ eq : c - function ] ) as @xmath199 the beta - function ( [ eq : our beta ] ) is consistent with the notion that the bulk scalar field @xmath128 corresponds to the mass parameter of the boundary field theory , and the c - function ( [ eq : our c ] ) is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath200 from @xmath183 to @xmath201 as expected . substituting this result into eq.([kandv ] ) , we obtain @xmath202 which is monotonically decreasing @xmath203 as @xmath204 ( see fig.[fig : solution ] ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the expectation that mass perturbation deforms the @xmath17 ising cft to flow to a system with less degrees of freedom as dictated by the c - theorem .",
    "namely it is likely to flow to nothing ( @xmath19 ) in the ir .",
    "in this article , we have obtained the partition function of the ising model on euclidean two - dimensional lattice with the twisted boundary condition representing the torus with a complex structure @xmath0 in a discretized version .",
    "we have taken an appropriate scaling limit to obtain a continuum limit for the torus with the complex structure @xmath0 , retaining a deviation from the critical temperature .",
    "the resulting continuum partition function agrees with that of the mass - deformed ising cft , namely the continuum field theory of massive majorana fermion on the torus with the complex structure @xmath0 .",
    "we have also discussed the rg flow of the ising model off critical temperature in terms of the three - dimensional ads gravity together with a scalar field @xmath128 representing the rg flow of the mass parameter . by using the hamilton - jacobi equation ,",
    "we have found that a simple nonlinear kinetic function @xmath134 in eq.([eq : k ] ) and a simple potential @xmath137 in eq.([eq : potential ] ) for the scalar field @xmath128 describes the expected rg flow from @xmath17 cft at the uv region towards @xmath19 at the ir .",
    "let us comment on the relation of our results to those in ref.@xcite where a similar setup has been used to look for solutions interpolating two ads geometries corresponding to two different conformal field theories .",
    "they assumed the canonical kinetic term @xmath205 for the scalar field @xmath128 , which is achieved by a field redefinition from our case .",
    "they required that the metric component @xmath206 has a double zero at the horizon @xmath207 ( ir ) , at which the metric becomes another ads geometry in addition to an ads geometry at @xmath150 ( uv ) .",
    "near @xmath208 at uv , their solution exhibits a chirally asymmetric virasoro algebra , where the excitation spectra of the left and right virasoro algebras , @xmath209 and @xmath210 are different .",
    "this peculiar behavior comes from their ansatz with the non - vanishing metric component @xmath211 , where @xmath212 are coordinates other than @xmath147 corresponding to our @xmath213 in eq.([ansatz1 ] ) .",
    "we have chosen a different ansatz with @xmath214 in eq.([ansatz1 ] ) to obtain chirally symmetric virasoro algebras , as in the ising model .",
    "we have used the hamilton - jacobi equation to describe the rg flow of partition functions of the ising model on the torus .",
    "there are more detailed informations such as multi - point correlation functions or ( equivalently ) partition functions on higher genus riemann surfaces . in principle",
    ", one should be able to describe these data , which are worth studying .",
    "however , it is likely that one needs to overcome the problems associated with the strong coupling , or quantum effects in gravity in order to describe these data quantitatively in the presence of matter fields .",
    "recent applications of ads / cft to condensed matter physics provide many interesting insights into possible phase structures of strongly coupled system . in particular ,",
    "introducing periodicity into the system to mimic lattice structures seems to be a crucial feature of these applications@xcite .",
    "since many realistic models of statistical physics or condensed matter physics are built on some discretized system , it is desirable to obtain discretized models as the boundary of some discretized model for the bulk in discussing the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "we hope that the continuum space - time would emerge by taking the continuum limit of the discretized system in the bulk and the gravity would be realized as a sort of a cooperative phenomenon .",
    "this ambitious objective is of course still quite hard to achieve . how to obtain a discretized version of ( quantum ) gravity realizing the given discretized model on the boundary is the key question which is worth pursuing .",
    "with this philosophy in mind and taking our result quite optimistic , we may expect that the usual two - dimensional ising model would be a candidate of the discrete boundary model related to a discrete version of quantum gravity in the above sense , and our result may be a first step toward this direction , since the deviation parameter @xmath97 from the critical temperature is actually included in the original discretized ising model . however our discussion still remained within the continuum theory . in this sense , it would be a great step if one finds a gravity description of the rg flow parametrized by @xmath215 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg flow ] .",
    "such an attempt is interesting in its own right , and furthermore can provide a concrete starting point to incorporate lattice structures into the ads / cft correspondence , which may play a vital role in condensed matter physics applications .",
    "we thank tetsuo deguchi for a valuable discussion on the ising model , and yoshifumi hyakutake and keiju murata for useful discussions on the rg flow in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .",
