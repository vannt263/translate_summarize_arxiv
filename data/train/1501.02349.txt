    "0.25 in    we consider boundary value problems generated by the sturm - liouville equation on a connected compact metric graph with continuity and kirchhoff s conditions at interior vertices and robin or dirichlet conditions at pendant vertices ( i.e. vertices of degree 1 ) .",
    "the potentials in the sturm - liouville equations and constants in the conditions are assumed to be real , and such that the corresponding operator is self - adjoint .    to describe the spectrum of a boundary value problems on metric graphs it is possible to use characteristic functions or spectral determinants .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the characteristic function @xmath0 of the boundary value problem on a graph @xmath1 which consists of two subgraphs @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the generalized neumann ( i.e. continuity + kirchhoff s ) boundary condition at the only cut - vertex ( see @xcite , p.54 for a definition ) * v * of @xmath1 satisfies @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are the characteristic functions of boundary value problems on subgtaphs @xmath2 and @xmath3 with neumann conditions at * v * , and @xmath7 are the characteristic functions of boundary value problems on @xmath2 and @xmath3 with dirichlet condition at * v*.    formula ( [ 1.1 ] ) was proved in @xcite for trees but the proof is quite the same for any separable graph .",
    "earlier this formula was obtained for the so - called spectral determinants @xcite . in case of neumann conditions at pendant vertices and under the condition of no loops and multiple edges",
    "the spectral determinant is nothing but our characteristic function .",
    "also it should be mentioned that in @xcite a definition of spectral determinant introduced in @xcite was used which is not quite accurate .",
    "the solutions @xmath8 and @xmath9 defined by ( 1)(3 ) in @xcite not always exist , e.g. in case of @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( in terms of @xcite ) these solutions are absent .",
    "therefore we use the characteristic functions language in the present paper to be mathematically regorous .",
    "formula ( [ 1.1 ] ) for the graph @xmath12 ( a path with two edges ) has been used for solving the so - called inverse three spectra problem @xcite and the hochstadt - lieberman problem @xcite and for describing spectral problems generated by equations of stieltjes strings on trees in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    a graph of connectivity 1 ( see @xcite , p.75 or @xcite , p.72 for a definition ) , i.e. a separable graph can be considered as a series connection of its subgraphs . in the present paper",
    "we consider a parallel connection of subgraphs into a graph of connectivity 2 aiming to deduce an analogue of ( [ 1.1 ] ) for parallel connection of subgraphs .",
    "0.25 in    characteristic functions of boundary value problems on graphs are natural generalizations of characteristic functions of boundary value problems on an interval . for an interval we use the following four characteristic functions .",

    "an arbitrary vertex v is chosen as the root . since",
    "as it will be clear below our results do not depend on the orientation of the edges , we fix an arbitrary orientation but for the sake of convinience we assume that the root * v * has only outgoing incident edges .",
