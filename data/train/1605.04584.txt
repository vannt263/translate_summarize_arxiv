    "the optimal dividend problem concerns maximizing the expected discounted cumulative dividend paid up to the time of ruin . the classical optimal dividend problem has been considered by many authors since de finetti @xcite , who first introduced the barrier strategy , in which all surpluses above a given level are transferred to a beneficiary , and raised the question of optimizing its level .",

    "there are various interpretations for the dual model .",
