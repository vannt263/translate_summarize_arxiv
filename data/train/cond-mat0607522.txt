    "_ geometry _ : we consider a long , narrow , quantum - critical , itinerant electron system with an electric field applied along its length .",
    "the system is longer than its transport length so that an electron traversing the sample scatters from magnons many times .",
    "the system must also be wide enough that it displays bulk behaviour , but narrow enough that heat generated within the sample can be transported to the boundary",
    ".    _ critical fields _ : starting from some low base temperature , @xmath5 , and gradually increasing the electric field one may anticipate two fields at which the response may become non - linear :    \\i . when the energy gained by an electron from the electric field between scattering events exceeds the temperature ; @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the transport scattering length",
    "when the joule heating rate exceeds the rate at which heat may be transported from the sample by a transverse heat flow ; @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the electrical and thermal conductivities .",
    "the latter result has been obtained using @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the thermal scattering length and @xmath13 is the sample width .    in this work ,",
    "we will be primarily concerned with the former case . in order for a system to be in this regime , we require that @xmath14 , so that we hit the field @xmath15 first when increasing the electric field from zero ; _",
    "i.e. _ we require that @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , for the system to exhibit bulk behaviour requires that it be wider than its correlation length , @xmath17 .",
    "combining these two conditions upon the sample width yields @xmath18 due to additional angular factors , the transport length is substantially greater than the thermal scattering length , @xmath19 , so that there is a large window of sample widths over which the type of non - linear response that we envisage can occur . in the high - temperature limit ( with @xmath20 nevertheless ) in which experimental investigations of itinerant electron quantum criticality are usually carried out , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the angle of scattering .",
    "this regime is somewhat delicately balanced between the macro- and microscopic . in a truly macroscopic sample",
    "where @xmath23 , non - linearity always occurs due to the failure to conduct away excess joule heat . in our case",
    ", the transverse size of the system must be small enough that @xmath24 , but the system inherits its behaviour from macroscopic equilibrium properties since it is larger than the correlation length@xcite .",
    "if the above constraints are satisfied , the non - linear transport properties depend only upon bulk properties and are independent of the dimensions of the system .",
    "_ thermal coupling _ : determining the non - linear response requires keeping careful track of the various heat flows .",
    "we consider a simplified scheme of thermal couplings in our sample :    \\i . the electrons couple to a heat sink at the boundaries of the sample and scatter from magnons .",
    "we do not consider electron - electron scattering since this is higher order in temperature or electric field than electron - magnon scattering and so sub - leading at low temperatures and fields .",
    "the magnons may scatter both from one another and from the electrons .",
    "we do not consider coupling between magnons and the heat sink .",
    "our reason is that magnon - phonon relaxation is higher order in temperature or field than magnon - electron scattering and therefore weaker at low temperatures and field .    _ heuristic treatment _ : given these descriptions of the geometry of our system and the various microscopic couplings , we are now in a position to give a heuristic derivation of our main results .",
    "heat enters the system via joule heating and ultimately leaves through a transverse heat flow maintained by a transverse variation in temperature . in the absence of scattering between electrons",
    ", this energy must pass through the magnons : joule heating pumps energy into higher moments of the electron distribution .",
    "this is ultimately carried away by a transverse heat flow maintained by a gradient in the symmetrical part of the electron distribution .",
    "energy can only pass into the symmetrical part of the distribution due to scattering _ via _ magnons . in leading approximation ,",
    "the magnons are raised to an effective temperature @xmath25 determined by a balance between the joule heating rate and the rate at which the magnons at @xmath25 lose energy to the electrons at @xmath26 .",
    "equating these two rates of change of energy leads to a self - consistency equation for @xmath27 .    in the high - temperature limit ,",
    "the scattering time @xmath28 , the transport scattering time @xmath29 and the magnon energy decay rate @xmath30 are related as follows : @xmath31 using these relations for a system whose thermal equilibrium resistivity scales as @xmath0 , we find @xmath32 by equating these two rates leads we deduce that @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "it is worth spending a moment to note the main distinction between our two works .",
    "et al_@xcite consider an itinerant electron system with essentially two - dimensional geometry and an electric field applied in the third short direction . in this case ,",
    "an electron traversing the sample from one lead to another does not scatter appreciably from magnons the electron distribution is determined to leading order by the distributions in the leads and may be written directly in terms of them using a keldysh formalism .",
    "et al _ present an appealing derivation of this zeroth order distribution and show , using a renormalization group analysis , that an effective temperature proportional to the applied voltage results . in our case , by contrast , an electron traversing the sample between the two leads scatters many times off magnons and the electron distribution must be calculated self - consistently from the start@xcite .    in the rest of this paper , we will spend some time fleshing out the mathematical details of this general scheme .",
    "we begin in the next section by reviewing the boltzmann approach to thermal equilibrium transport in quantum critical metals .",
    "we will use boltzmann transport techniques to analyse the out - of - equilibrium response of a quantum critical system to an electric field .",
    "although this approach is familiar in other contexts , itinerant - electron quantum - critical transport is usually analysed by other means . therefore , in this section , we will spend a little time summarising quantum critical transport in thermal equilibrium and how this may be described using a boltzmann equation approach .",
    "this exposition will also serve as a useful way of defining the notation that we will use later in our analysis of the non - linear response",
    ".    our first step will be to describe the thermal - equilibrium magnon propagator .",
    "we follow this by writing down the electron boltzmann equation and construct its linear response solution .",
    "finally , we quote a number of relaxation rates that will useful in our non - equilibrium analysis .",
    "the details of the calculation of these within a boltzmann framework is somewhat similar to that of the relaxation rates due to phonon scattering .",
    "we sketch these calculations in appendix a.      we work within the moriya - hertz - millis  @xcite approach to itinerant electron quantum criticality . the bosonic , magnetic critical modes  the magnons  are treated separately from the electrons ( although they are , of course , made from electrons ) .",

    "the first step in the moriya - hertz - millis approach to itinerant electron quantum criticality , is to determine the critical properties of the magnons .",
    "these critical properties are the combined result of the magnons self - interaction and their overdamped dynamics due to landau damping .",
    "the simplest way to do this is through the self - consistent renormalization group@xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may use a more rigorous application of the renormalization group@xcite in order to obtain essentially the same results . in either case",

    "<S> the notion of quantum criticality provides one of the few unifying theoretical principles of strongly correlated electrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it describes a range of phenomena in systems that are near to continuous , zero - temperature phase transitions ; phase transitions that are driven by quantum rather than thermal fluctuations . in thermal equilibrium , </S>",
    "<S> quantum critical systems show characteristic spatial and temporal scaling in their response to external probes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the conductivity of an itinerant - electron system near to a magnetic quantum phase transition has a power - law dependence upon temperature  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of quantum critical systems out of thermal equilibrium has begun to attract growing attention over the past few years . near to a quantum phase transition all of the intrinsic energy scales of a system , other than the fermi energy , renormalize to zero . in thermal equilibrium , </S>",
    "<S> the only remaining energy scale is the temperature itself . because of this , quantum critical systems are particularly susceptible to being driven out of equilibrium by external probes . in certain situations </S>",
    "<S> the universal temporal scaling near to the quantum critical point may reveal itself in universal features of the steady - state adopted out of equilibrium ; the out - of - equilibrium state being largely determined by a system s dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> several recent works have addressed the question of whether universality persists when a quantum critical system is driven out of thermal equilibrium by the application of a strong electric field . in particular , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and  @xcite considered two - dimensional superconductor - insulator transitions  @xcite , the former in the case where the quantum dynamics and phase transition were controlled by coupling to a caldeira - leggett bath and the latter in the case of intrinsic superconducting dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> these systems can indeed display universality out of equilibrium  @xcite in both their current response  @xcite and their current noise statistics@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the triumph of refs .  </S>",

    "<S> numerical studies of related one - dimensional systems produced similar results  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the critical modes at the superconductor - insulator transition are charged and couple directly to the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> a more typical situation has critical modes without a charge  often magnetic  which affect transport by scattering from electrons . </S>",

    "<S> we find that given certain conditions on size and geometry , quantum critical itinerant magnets show a universal non - linear current response . for a long , narrow sample , with an electric field applied along its length , we predict a universal non - linear scaling of current with field given by @xmath3 where the thermal equilibrium resistivity is proportional to @xmath0 and @xmath1 is the dynamical exponent . in the case of the moriya - hertz - millis  @xcite model of the critical ferromagnet , @xmath4 . provided that certain constraints upon the dimension of the system are satisfied </S>",

    "<S> we hope that these results will provide an alternative experimental window upon quantum criticality . despite its successes , </S>",
    "<S> the theory of itinerant - electron quantum criticality has some puzzling problems ; although power law dependencies upon temperature are seen experimentally , there is often a discrepancy between the observed and predicted powers in transport . </S>",
    "<S> non - linear response may help to resolve this issue by providing two consistency checks : whether the equilibrium exponents are consistent with the out - of - equilibrium exponents through eq.([firsteq ] ) ; and whether the out - of - equilibrium exponent is consistent with the moriya - hertz - millis theory .    </S>",
    "<S> our paper is outlined as follows : we begin in section 1 with a general description of our scheme , paying particular attention to matters of geometry and heat flows within the system . </S>",
    "<S> this will enable a heuristic derivation of our main results and a detailed comparison with the complementary work of mitra _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in section 2 </S>",
    "<S> , we will begin with a survey of the boltzmann treatment of the linear response of the itinerant - electron quantum critical system in thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow us to introduce some notation and familiarize the reader with its application in this context . </S>",
    "<S> we follow this in section 3 by applying the boltzmann transport formalism to the out of equilibrium system . </S>",
    "<S> this section contains a formal derivation of our main results . finally , in section 4 </S>",
