    "the old problem of the missing opacity in the uv region of the solar spectrum ( holweger 1970 , gustafsson et al .",
    "1975 ) was claimed to be solved by kurucz ( 1992 ) , who included millions of atomic and molecular lines previously ignored in the computation of model atmospheres .",
    "later , bell , paltoglou & tripicco ( 1994 ) criticized that solution , and the controversy has been recently revived by balachandran & bell ( 1998 ) in connection with its relevance to the solar beryllium abundance . in the mean time , malagnini et al .",

    "( 1993 ) compared observations and kurucz s calculations for late - g and early - k stars , and found that theory underpredicted the near - uv fluxes . very recently",
    ", other authors have not found such inconsistencies in the analysis of uv spectra for late - type metal - poor stars and also for o - b - a stars ( peterson 1999 , fitzpatrick & massa 1998 , 1999a , 1999b ) .",
    "the situation is confusing .",
    "a reappraisal deserves to be made taking advantage of recent revisions of stellar near - uv fluxes measured by the iue satellite and the availability of _ hipparcos _ parallaxes ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "the continuum observed in the spectral region between 2500 and 3000   is formed in the lower layers of the photosphere for late - type stars .",
    "while shorter wavelengths map higher atmospheric layers , this spectral band is particularly important as a spectroscopic tool , independent of the optical window , to analyze the stellar photosphere .",
    "uv spectra are of relevance to the determination of abundances of several astrophysically interesting elements such as boron ( duncan et al .",
    "1998 ) or neutron - capture elements such as osmium , platinum , or lead ( sneden et al . 1998 ) . in a spectral region",
    "were spectral lines are highly crowded , a demostration that observed fluxes match those predicted by the models used for the abundance analysis gives confidence in the derived abundances . in addition",
    ", it has been recognized in the literature ( lanz et al .",
    "1999 ) that good understanding of the near - uv spectrum of a@xmath2f stars is key for dating intermediate - age stellar populations .    accurate measurements of stellar fluxes in the ultraviolet are in principle possible from outside earth s atmosphere .",
    "absolute fluxes were first measured through the long - wavelength cameras of the iue satellite , later the shuttle - borne wuppe instrument , and finally through ghrs , and now its substitute stis , onboard hst .",
    "the quality of the fluxes measured by hst is high , but spectrographs onboard have mainly been used for high dispersion and therefore span a limited spectral coverage .",
    "the long life of the iue satellite provided an extensive dataset of low dispersion spectra , although even the recently released ( newsips ) version of the database has been found to include systematic effects ( massa & fitzpatrick 1998 ) . a newer version of the iue final archive , named ines ( iue newly extracted spectra ) has started to run at the time of writing this paper ( rodrguez - pascual et al . 1999 ) .",
    "observations provide the flux at the earth .",
    "model atmospheres predict the surface flux per unit area .",
    "observation and prediction are related by the stellar distance from earth and the stellar radius . the absolute magnitude calculated using the apparent visual magnitude , a bolometric correction , and the _ hipparcos _",
    "parallax is combined with an estimate of the effective temperature and theoretical evolutionary tracks to derive the stellar radius .",
    "the radius and the _ hipparcos _ parallax make it possible to correct the observed flux for dilution by the inverse - square law and so obtain the flux emitted from the stellar surface .",
    "comparison with predicted fluxes is made for a range in effective temperature and metallicity with the best fit to the observed fluxes providing estimates of these two quantities .",
    "( predicted fluxes are weakly sensitive to surface gravity . )",
    "we compare these estimates with those obtained by other techniques such as the infrared flux method , and analysis of absorption lines in optical spectra .",
    "iue observations have been entirely reprocessed in a homogeneous fashion with the set of procedures named newsips to produce the iue final archive .",
    "this database , in particular the node operated at villafranca satellite tracking station near madrid , has been the source of the spectra analyzed here .",
    "a newer version of the archive is being released through prototype servers ( rodrguez - pascual et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "several improvements are present in the low - resolution newsips spectra employed here with respect to the older algorithms , such as a better weighted slit extraction method , and a correction for the sensitivity degradation of the detectors over the life of the satellite and temperature variations .",
    "an improved procedure for obtaining the absolute flux calibrations was also implemented .",
    "the reader is referred to the iue newsips information manual ( garhart et al .",
    "1997 ) and references therein for more detailed information .    when more than a single spectra was available for a given star , they were combined and cleaned using the iuedac idl software libraries to produce a single spectrum per star .",
    "the effect of interstellar reddening was considered negligible .",
    "we specifically refer to the near - uv as the region between 20003000  .",
    "this spectral band is particularly interesting for the study of stellar atmospheres , as it maps the deeper parts of the photosphere , down below the region where the optical continuum is formed , but not as deep as the continuum observed at 1.6 @xmath3 m .",
    "a simple sketch of the main hydrogenic opacities from 1 to 3 @xmath3 m at a temperature of 5000 k and an electron pressure of 3 dyn @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "1 . hydrogen rayleigh scattering , and even more importantly , but not represented in fig .",
    "1 , photoionization of carbon , silicon , aluminum , magnesium , and iron produce a tremendous increase of the continuum opacity for wavelengths shorter than about 2500   ( see gray 1992 and references therein ) , and radiation is only able to escape from the higher atmosphere .",
    "continuum opacity at 5000 k and 3 dyn @xmath5 in the near - uv , optical and near - ir .",
    "the region between 2000 and 3000  , in which we concentrate is highlighted , and the wavelength coverage of the near - ir broad - band filters j , h , and k is indicated .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]      to the temperature , defined as the variation in the emerging flux produced by a 10 % change in the temperature at a given optical depth .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    between roughly 2000 and 2500   and for solar abundances magnesium photoionization dominates the continuum absorption , and the opacity is larger , but of the same order of magnitude ( yet uncertain ) as the h@xmath6 in the optical and near - ir .",
    "bound - free opacity is the main contributor to the continuum opacity between 2500 and 3000  .",
    "a quantitative measure of the formation depths of the continuum at those wavelengths for a solar - like photosphere can be obtained computing the response function to temperature .",
    "figure 2 shows the changes in the _ true _ continuum ( not including line absorption ) at the stellar surface resulting from an increase of 10% in temperature at different atmospheric depths .",
    "the different lines correspond to different wavelengths , and the longer the wavelength , the higher ( outer ) in the atmosphere the response function peaks .",
    "therefore , between roughly 2500 and 3000  the continuum is formed in deeper regions than the optical continuum , while at shorter wavelengths the continuum covers higher layers . due to the typical decrease of the flux towards shorter wavelengths in this region of the spectrum for late - type stars , and to the limited signal - to - noise ratio in the iue spectra , it is the region between 2500 and 3000   from where",
    "most of the information will be retrieved .",
    "we have made use of the flux distributions calculated by kurucz , and available at ccp7 since 1993 .",
    "the grid includes models for different gravities ( @xmath7 , effective temperatures ( @xmath0 ) and metal contents ( [ fe / h ] ) , while the parameters in the mixing - length treatment of the convection are fixed , as well as it is the microturbulence ( 2 km s@xmath8 ) , and the abundance ratio between different metals ( solar - like mixture ) . for a given set of ( @xmath0 , @xmath9 , [ fe / h ] )",

    "[ fe / h ] , @xmath9 ) for a star like the sun . [ fig3 ] ]    neutral metals are large contributors to line absorption in the near - uv .",
    "therefore , temperature has three allied effects on the emerging flux .",
    "firstly , hotter temperatures increase the available flux .",
    "they also reduce the importance of photodetachment absorption of h@xmath6 , and so decrease the continuum absorption .",
    "besides , the diminished abundance of neutral metals reduces the line absorption .",
    "the net effect is an important increment in the emerging flux .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "3 show the result of a change of @xmath10 k in the effective temperature for a solar model atmosphere .",
    "changes in chemical composition are important mainly for the neutral metal s contribution to the line absorption , and this is demonstrated by the dashed lines , which correspond to modifying in @xmath11 dex the logarithm of the solar metal abundance .",
    "gas pressure plays a minor role , as reflect the dotted lines in fig .",
    "3 , which correspond to changes in gravity of a 70% .",
    "the effects of @xmath0 and the metal content are significant , and both leave characteristic signatures on the absolute flux resulting from the different shape of the line and continuum absorption .",
    "this will make it possible to estimate these two stellar parameters from the observed absolute fluxes .",
    "3 shows that the changes in the slope of the observed spectrum induced by variations of @xmath0 or [ fe / h ] are more subtle ; it is much more difficult to extract the information on the atmospheric physical conditions from _ relative _ ( not absolute ) measurements of the spectral energy distribution in these wavelengths , as already demonstrated by lanz et al .",
    "the modeling of late - type stellar spectra in the near - uv region presents all the same problems as any other spectral window .",
    "the adequacy of the assumptions involved in the construction of model atmospheres is critical .",
    "line blanketing affects the structure of stellar photospheres ( mihalas 1978 ) , but as an extra difficulty , in the near - uv the concentration of lines is so high as to give shape to the overall energy distribution .",
    "early confrontation of uv fluxes predicted by classical model atmospheres with observations ( holweger 1970 , gustafsson et al .",
    "1975 ) revealed inconsistencies , the predicted fluxes exceeding observations .",
    "later kurucz ( 1992 ) claimed to have solved the problem by including previously missing line absorption .",
    "bell , paltoglou & tripicco ( 1994 ) presented evidence that kurucz to had included too many lines .",
    "a comparison at high dispersion in the regions 34003450   and 46004650    revealed that synthetic spectra based on kurucz s linelist predicted stronger - than - observed absorption features .",
    "bell et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and later balachandran & bell ( 1998 ) , suggested missing contributors to the continuum absorption rather than line blanketing as a possible explanation for the problem .",
    "it is unclear whether kurucz s calculations experience that weakness in the spectral window we concentrate on ( 20003000  ) , but while comparison of synthetic spectra and observations of the sun ( or any other single star ) will leave room for line absorption to mimic missing continuum opacity , or viceversa , simultaneous comparison with a number of stars of different temperatures , and in particular , chemical compositions , will strongly limit that possibility .    ]    in any case , comparison with the sun is a must .",
    "colina , bohlin & castelli ( 1996 ) compiled an updated version of the available measurements of the solar flux distribution .",
    "4 shows fairly good agreement with the theoretical predictions , in consistency with kurucz s claims .",
    "the fluxes are compared at the solar surface .",
    "the stellar parameters are known for no star with such an extremely high accuracy as for the sun .",
    "however , semi - empirical methods to derive @xmath0s have been applied to solar - metallicity stars .",
    "the infrared flux method ( irfm ; blackwell et al .",
    "1991 ) is weakly dependent on the model atmospheres , and in particular , the line blanketing only affects the atmospheric structure , but not the calculation of the flux itself .",
    "the procedure s reliability has been tested with temperatures obtained from measurements of angular diameters by lunar occultation .    in the following sections we compare @xmath0s and [ fe / h]s for the stars with metallicities in the range @xmath12 [ fe / h ] @xmath13 studied by alonso et al .",
    "( 1996 ) with those obtained from the comparison of predicted and observed near - uv fluxes .",
    "the irfm has been applied by alonso et al . to a large sample of late - type dwarfs and subgiants with either spectroscopic or photometric estimates of the metallicity , making it possible to constrain the second fundamental parameter that influences the near - uv continuum . despite the claimed weak - dependence of the results on the choice of model atmosphere , it is interesting to mention that the models employed in this study are similar , if not identical , to those used by kurucz to compute the predicted flux distributions employed here .",
    "gratton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) made use of the published results from the irfm to construct a reference frame of stars , and used it in combination with other spectroscopic indicators , such as the iron ionization balance , to derive stellar parameters for a larger sample of stars . again",
    ", similar or identical model atmospheres are involved .",
    "our analysis adopts the following scheme :    1 .",
    "estimates of the stellar mass ( @xmath14 ) , and bolometric correction ( @xmath15 ) are obtained following the same procedure as in allende prieto et al .",
    "briefly , the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes ( @xmath16 ) are used to transform visual @xmath17 magnitudes to absolute @xmath18 magnitudes . depending on the metallicity , an isochrone from the calculations by bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 )",
    "is then used to estimate @xmath14 and @xmath15 , interpolating in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 relationships . here",
    "it is assumed that stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath21 have an age of 9 @xmath22 years , and those with [ fe / h ] @xmath23 are 12 @xmath22 years old , although this is has a negligible relevance ( see allende prieto et al .",
    "2 .   using the initial estimates for the effective temperature from a source ( e.g. alonso et al .",
    "1996 ) , @xmath24 , the gravities and radii are then obtained through the well - known expressions : @xmath25 + @xmath26 3 .",
    "the near - uv iue spectra are compared with the synthetic spectra , after converting the flux predicted at the stellar surface to earth using the nondimensional dilution factor @xmath27 , deriving the values of @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] that minimize , in the least - square sense , their differences .",
    "this is performed using the nelder - mead simplex method for multidimensional minimization of a function , as implemented by press et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , giving even weights to all wavelengths .",
    "the gravity is then modified to be consistent with the new @xmath0 : @xmath28 + while variations in other magnitudes resulting from corrections in [ fe / h ] were found to be negligible .",
    "then , final values for @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] are derived from a new comparison between synthetic and observed spectra .",
    "the transfer of errors in gravity and distance determined from the _ hipparcos _ parallax ( see allende prieto et al . 1999 ) to errors in the derived @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] was estimated computing upper and lower limits to the dilution factor @xmath27 , and repeating the minimization of the differences between observed and predicted fluxes .",
    "the gravity is decreased and the dilution factor increased by the estimated uncertainties to produce upper limits for @xmath0 and lower limits for [ fe / h ] , and the signs of the increments are reversed to obtain lower limits for @xmath0 and upper limits for [ fe / h ] .",
    "this is generally appropriate , especially because errors in the flux dilution factors typically produce a much larger impact than those in the gravity . in a very few cases , when",
    "the internal uncertainties are particularly small , the rule of positive superindices ( upper limits ) and negative subindices ( lower limits ) in the derived @xmath0s and [ fe / h]s shown in tables 1 and 2 is broken .",
    "the use of the nelder - mead simplex method to find the best fit to the observed spectra is well justified , as for all extreme cases checked , a single minimum was present , and the @xmath29 was found to vary smoothly with @xmath30 and [ fe / h ] .",

    "<S> analyses of the near - ultraviolet continuum of late - type stars have led to controversial results regarding the performance of state - of - the - art model atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> the release of the homogeneous iue final archive and the availability of the high - accuracy _ hipparcos _ parallaxes provide an opportunity to revisit this issue , as accurate stellar distances make it possible to compare observed absolute fluxes with the predictions of model atmospheres .    </S>",
    "<S> the near - uv continuum is highly sensitive to @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] , and once the gravity is constrained from the parallax , these parameters may be derived from the analysis of low - dispersion _ long - wavelength _ ( 20003000  ) iue spectra for stars previously studied by alonso et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1996 ) using the infrared flux method ( irfm ) . </S>",
    "<S> a second comparison is carried out against the stars spectroscopically investigated by gratton et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that there is a good agreement between @xmath0s obtained from the irfm and from the near - uv continuum , and a remarkable correspondence between observed and synthetic fluxes for stars with @xmath1 k of any metallicity and gravity . </S>",
    "<S> these facts suggest that model atmospheres provide an adequate description of the near - uv continuum forming region and that the opacities involved are essentially understood . for cooler stars , </S>",
    "<S> the results of the irfm are no longer reliable , as shown by alonso et al . , but the discrepancy noticed for stars hotter than 6000 k may reflect problems in the model atmospheres and/or the opacities at these higher temperatures . </S>"
