    "beyond the orbit of neptune lies a disk of remnant planetesimals known as the kuiper belt .",
    "as outlined by jewitt , luu , & trujillo ( 1998 , hereafter jlt98 ) , the @xmath14100 known kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) divide into 3 dynamical classes .    1 .",
    "classical kbos reside in low eccentricity , low inclination orbits beyond 40 au ( jlt98 ) .",
    "they are not associated with mean motion resonances with neptune .",
    "2 .   resonant kbos , of which pluto is the largest known member , have orbital periods commensurate with that of neptune and are protected against close encounters with that planet ( malhotra 1996 ) .",
    "they possess moderately high eccentricities and inclinations , possibly excited by neptune during a transient period of orbital migration ( jlt98 ; malhotra 1995 ; malhotra , duncan , & levison 1999 , hereafter mdl99 ; and references therein ) .",
    "scattered kbos , of which 1996 tl@xmath15 is one member ( luu et al .",
    "1997 ) , occupy large , highly eccentric and inclined orbits , the result of close encounters with neptune ( duncan & levison 1997 ) .    of the 3 populations , the classical kuiper belt appears the most untouched dynamically .",
    "however , the record of primordial conditions preserved by the classical belt , as observed today out to 50 au , seems heavily weathered .",
    "recent surveys estimate the mass of the observable kuiper belt within 50 au to be a few @xmath16 @xmath17 ( e.g. , luu & jewitt 1998 ; this paper ) .",
    "hamid , marsden , & whipple ( 1968 ) used the trajectories of short - period comets to set an upper mass limit of @xmath18 on a smooth ring within 50 au .",
    "the mass of the nearby belt is therefore @xmath1410100 @xmath16 smaller than the @xmath14@xmath19 extrapolated from the condensable material of the outer giant planets .",
    "mass depletion since the time of formation is also suggested by the existence of bodies as large as pluto . to build bodies of this size at 36 au within 100 myr ( the estimated formation time of neptune ) , the standard model of pairwise planetesimal accretion",
    "requires the primordial disk to have at least @xmath14110 @xmath20 from 29 to 41 au , depending on the assumed sizes of seed planetesimals ( kenyon & luu 1998 ; cf .",
    "stern & colwell 1997 ) .",
    "the cause of the presumed depletion is unclear , but neptune is considered a prime suspect .",
    "duncan , levison , & budd ( 1995 ) calculate that neptune , when fixed in its present orbit , can gravitationally eject more than 90% of the belt mass inside 39 au over the age of the solar system . about 5090% of the mass between 39 and 50 au may be depleted by gravitational perturbations alone .",
    "these simulations are sensitive to assumed initial eccentricities and inclinations of test particles .",
    "collisions are also proposed to explain the missing mass , either by nudging objects into unstable orbits ( davis & farinella 1997 ) , or by grinding bodies down to dust to be transported by radiation pressure ( stern & colwell 1997 ) . in both cases , however , only the smallest kbos may be significantly depleted .",
    "collisionally relaxed populations place most of their mass in the largest bodies , but most of their geometric cross section in the smallest members .",
    "collisions might therefore preferentially grind down the smallest objects , leaving the largest bodies undisrupted and the total mass mostly intact .",
    "this expectation is borne out in computations by davis & farinella ( 1997 ) .",
    "important caveats for all collisional simulations of the kuiper belt include oversimplified prescriptions for the impact strengths of kbos , reflecting our ignorance of their internal structure .",
    "erosive velocities are thought to be gravitationally stirred by neptune within 50 au , but physically motivated estimates of the velocity dispersion have yet to be made in these simulations .    however large or small , the destructive influence of neptune on the kuiper belt may be limited to within the location of its outermost 2:1 resonance at 48 au .",
    "this idea has led to speculation that the surface density of belt material rises by @xmath142 orders of magnitude to its assumed primordial value somewhere beyond this radius ( stern 1996 ; stern & colwell 1997 ; mdl99 ) . however , no classical kbo beyond 50 au has yet been discovered .",
    "assuming the shape of the kbo size distribution does not change with distance , jlt98 find by monte carlo simulation that their observations are consistent with an edge to the classical kuiper belt at 50 au  a `` kuiper cliff '' .",
    "the first theoretical constraints on the classical belt mass beyond 50 au are provided by ward & hahn ( 1998 ) .",
    "they find under certain conditions that a belt containing @xmath21 from 48 to 75 au damps neptune s eccentricity to its current observed value of 0.009 by the action of apsidal density waves .",
    "they calculate that the addition of 10 times more mass in this region ( masses comparable to those expected in the minimum - mass solar nebula ) would reduce neptune s eccentricity to less than @xmath22 over the age of the solar system . in these computations ,",
    "the outer belt is assumed to consist predominantly of small bodies ( diameters @xmath23 140 km ) so that velocity dispersions are sufficiently low to sustain wave action .    in the absence of any direct observations of the kuiper belt beyond 50 au",
    ", we undertook a pilot survey utilizing the keck 10-m telescope . a single 600s exposure on keck",
    "can achieve a depth @xmath24 , allowing objects 100 km in diameter with comet - like albedos to be seen out to distances just beyond 50 au .",
    "combining exposures in software enables the detection of such bodies inside 70 au . our primary aim was to constrain the kbo luminosity function out to @xmath25",
    "; in this goal , we succeeded .",
    "our principal hope was to directly image the kuiper belt for the first time beyond 50 au ; this wish remains to be fulfilled at present .",
    "observations are described in  [ observe ] .",
    "methods of data reduction and search strategies are set forth in ",
    "[ strategy ] .",
    "results , including actual detections and our construction of the luminosity function from @xmath26 to 28 , are presented in  [ result ] .",
    "implications of our results on the size , mass , and distance distributions of kbos are discussed in ",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "our principal findings are summarized in  [ summary ] .",
    "data were taken on 31 august 1997 ut using the keck ii 10-m telescope atop mauna kea in hawaii . the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) was mounted at cassegrain focus and employed in direct imaging mode .",
    "the plate scale on lris s textronix ccd was 0.215 @xmath27/pixel .",
    "the camera had a useable ( vignetted ) field of view of 5.67 @xmath16 7.34 square arcminutes ( 1582 @xmath16 2048 square pixels = 0.0115 square degrees ) .",
    "a standard v filter was used .",
    "the choice of v over r was motivated by lower sky brightness and greater solar flux at v. while some kbos have higher reflectances at r , others also appear neutral ( tegler & romanishin 1998 ) .",
    "we searched for kbos in a single , relatively star - free field at opposition [ @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( j2000 ) ] .",
    "away in ecliptic longitude from neptune . ] twenty - nine exposures , each 600s in duration , were recorded of this field .",
    "data were read out from the ccd through two amplifiers operating simultaneously ; this procedure halved the readout time to 60s at the cost of introducing small differences in the amount of noise between chip halves .",
    "each frame was offset in position by @xmath145100@xmath27 relative to other frames ; our dithering routine enabled the construction of high - fidelity flatfields ( `` skyflats '' ) from the science data themselves ( see  [ strategy1 ] ) .",
    "provided the keck telescope functioned properly , our duty cycle efficiency was nearly 90% .",
    "unforeseen crashes in the mirror alignment software limited our total effective integration time to 4.8 hr over a 6.2 hr baseline .    a landolt field ( landolt 1992 ) provided photometric standards .",
    "the seeing ranged from 0@xmath3065 to 1@xmath300 full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , with the median seeing equal  to  0@xmath3075 .",
    "kuiper belt object candidates are identified by their parallax motions ( of order @xmath27/hr ) against the fixed stars .",
    "we employed two search methods : a simple blinking of individual frames to visually scan for slow - moving objects , and a deep , recombinative blinking approach which blends the search algorithms of gladman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and cochran et al . (",
    "1995 ) .",
    "observations of candidates over a single night are insufficient to constrain orbital parameters and to prove membership in the kuiper belt .",
    "candidates might instead be eccentric , near - earth asteroids whose apparent motions mimic those of true kbos .",
    "however , as discussed by luu & jewitt ( 1998 ) , the possibility of mistaken identity appears remote , since masquerading slow - moving objects have not appeared in their many surveys to date .",
    "we proceed on the assumption that our ( small ) field is likewise uncontaminated .      all image processing described in this paper",
    "was performed with the interactive data language ( idl ) software package .",
    "the 29 science frames were first corrected for ccd bias and pixel - to - pixel variations in gain ( flat - fielded ) . for each science frame",
    ", a tailored flatfield was constructed from the median of the other 28 dithered science frames .",
    "the fact that the images were dithered ensured that each ccd pixel sampled the flat sky several times .",
    "each flattened frame had its mean sky value subtracted and its flux normalized by scaling eleven bright , unsaturated stars distributed across the entire frame .",
    "position offsets required to align the dithered images were obtained by minimizing stellar residuals of frames subtracted pairwise .",
    "aligned images were blinked and visually scanned for slow - moving objects .",
    "three images of comparable seeing , spaced about 1 hr apart , were blinked per session .",
    "four triplets were blinked in all , including the first and last frames of the night .",
    "results of this comparatively shallow survey are presented in ",
    "[ shalsurv ] .      the basic idea underlying",
    "our deep survey is simple .",
    "images are stacked and shifted on top of each other according to a hypothetical kbo proper motion .",
    "the shifted stack of images is co - added to form a recombination image . while stationary objects appear smeared in the recombination image , an object whose motion matches that assumed has its signal strengthened and appears as a single seeing disk .",
    "thus , all collected photons are used to identify kbos too faint to rise above the noise of an individual image .    to reduce confusion and noise in the recombination image ,",
    "it is desirable to remove non - kbo sources of emission from individual frames before co - adding . towards this end , we subtracted from each individual frame the median of the other 28 ( aligned ) frames . extended , stationary , low surface brightness emission ( from resolved galaxies , for example ) was thereby mostly removed from individual images .",
    "some pixel positions did not have the full overlap of all 29 frames because of our dithering routine ; these were purged to ensure uniform statistics .",
    "cosmic rays and asteroid streaks remained in the median - subtracted frames .",
    "substantial residuals from stationary point sources were also left behind , a consequence of frame - to - frame seeing variations .",
    "all three non - kbo sources of emission were largely eliminated by clipping high - valued pixels from the shifted stack of images . after experimenting with various schemes , we decided to clip the 5 highest values from each column of 29 pixels and average the remaining 24 values . ) . ]",
    "columns not having the full overlap of all 29 frames due to the shifting process were purged altogether . finally , to the clipped mean image we added a positive constant frame to restore the average background level to zero .",
    "the resulting ( rectangular ) array constituted our recombination image , which appeared satisfyingly clean aside from a few well - localized and easily recognizable residuals from bloomed stars .",
    "the proper motion vector of a kbo is described by its amplitude , @xmath31 , and its apparent inclination angle , @xmath32 , relative to the ecliptic as seen on the ccd . following gladman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we visually searched for kbo candidates by blinking , in any one session , 4 recombination images corresponding to 4 successively higher amplitudes along one inclination .",
    "objects characteristically came into focus and then smeared as their actual rates of motion were approached and passed .",
    "recombination amplitudes ranged from @xmath33 to 6.3 @xmath27/hr in steps of @xmath34/hr .",
    "inclinations ranged from @xmath35 to 5@xmath36 in steps of @xmath37",
    ". implies motion near a descending ( ascending ) node .",
    "] these ranges cover proper motions ( as seen at opposition ) of kbos moving on prograde , circular , heliocentric orbits with semi - major axes @xmath38 of 20120 au and actual inclinations @xmath39 of up to @xmath40 .",
    "away from opposition in ecliptic longitude was included in calculating these ranges . ]",
    "roughly 130 artificial kbos were implanted at random locations and searched for simultaneously with true kbo candidates .",
    "their magnitudes were spread uniformly between @xmath41 and 29 , and their orbital parameters were chosen randomly within the ranges cited above .",
    "their presence in recombination images trained the eye to recognize _ bona fide _ kbos , and their rate of recovery provided an estimate of true kbo detection efficiency as a function of magnitude .",
    "differences between artificial objects given and recovered properties ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) provided estimates of systematic errors in the parameters of true candidates .",
    "recombination spacings were just small enough to detect artificially implanted kbos in at least 2 recombination frames .",
    "a list of kbo candidates was made containing objects ( including artificial ones ) which ( 1 ) focussed and de - focussed in the correct manner , ( 2 ) appeared in at least 2 adjacent recombination images , ( 3 ) did not appear as a single hot pixel in any 1 image , and ( 4 ) were not situated too close to the noisy environs of stellar / asteroidal residuals .",
    "objects in this list had their magnitudes and proper motions subsequently refined on a grid of resolution @xmath45/hr and @xmath46 .",
    "this process involved extracting square subframes 20 pixels wide surrounding each candidate and recombining them on the finer grid . simply selecting the grid point ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) for",
    "which counts inside a circular sampling aperture were maximized proved too simplistic a procedure . often the maximum - count image simply pushed hot noise pixels into our sampling aperture . in practice , we selected the best recombination image based on visual appearance , a well - behaved flux profile , and in the few cases where we could not decide , maximal counts .    without a second night to confirm the reality of our candidates , visual surveys of this kind are more prone to false detections . even apart from human bias ,",
    "noisy pixels may still conspire to masquerade as slow - moving objects . to estimate the number of false detections in our candidate list , we repeated our entire deep search on images recombined in the reverse direction .",
    "reverse in this case actually means in the apparent prograde direction , since proper motions of kbos at opposition are dominated by the earth s parallax motion and must appear retrograde .",
    "artificial , apparently prograde objects were also randomly inserted in individual frames and searched for in images recombined in the reverse direction . in this reverse survey , which suffered the same kinds of errors as afflicted the forward survey , objects that fulfilled the four requirements listed above and that turned out not to be artificially inserted",
    "were deemed chance alignments of noise .",
    "we refer to these as `` reverse survey noise objects . ''",
    "statistical confidence in the detection of real kbos demands that the number of candidates detected in the forward survey exceed the number detected in the reverse survey plus the uncertainty in the latter number . in practice ,",
    "we blinked recombination frames without knowing whether they were recombined in the forward or reverse directions , thereby avoiding another potential source of human bias .",
    "one kbo was discovered by blinking individual images .",
    "the object , hereafter obj1 , appears at the @xmath145.5@xmath47 level in 21 out of 29 frames . in the other 8 frames , light from obj1",

    "no false alarm went off in the reverse survey at the magnitude of obj2 ; the object distinguishes itself as the brightest detection at 5.5@xmath47 .",
    "by contrast , we view all candidates in the forward survey fainter than @xmath82 as false detections , partly because their numbers do not exceed those in the reverse survey .",
    "no object in both surveys is as visually convincing as obj2 ; many other candidates vanished at several ( but not all ) adjacent recombination gridpoints .",
    "moreover , regarding the last of the 4 search criteria set forth in  [ strategy2 ] , it was occasionally unclear when an object was `` too close '' to a smeared stellar residual . thus , some of our detections fainter than @xmath83 undoubtedly arise from the confusing noise of bloomed stars ( obj2 is far removed from any such noise ) .",

    "relative velocities required for fragmentation and dispersal of solid rocky bodies @xmath14100 km in size demand kbo eccentricities and inclinations exceeding 0.3 ; the actual history of the velocity dispersion is unknown . if kbos consist of solid rock and relative velocities are sufficiently high for disruption and dispersal upon impact , we estimate that lifetimes against catastrophic dispersal of targets @xmath14100 km in diameter exceed the age of the solar system by a factor of @xmath14150 if projectiles are drawn from the present - day kuiper belt .",
    "this estimate agrees with that of stern ( 1995 ) ; see his figure 2 . shaping the population of objects",

    "the sky density of objects ( number per projected sky solid angle ) located beyond distance @xmath167 is proportional to    @xmath168    where @xmath169 is the size of the smallest object which can just be seen at @xmath167 , and @xmath170 is the maximum distance out to which an object of size @xmath9 can be seen .",
    "one immediate consequence of a belt having distance and size indices considered here is that the faint end of the luminosity function is dominated by small nearby objects rather than large distant ones . extending the limiting magnitude of a visual survey inherently achieves greater dynamic range in observable sizes than in distances because reflected fluxes decrease as @xmath171 .",
    "the greater sensitivity to size is compounded by the shapes of the distributions ; @xmath172 .",
    "an outer edge to such a belt at 50 au ( a `` kuiper cliff '' ) would not significantly flatten the slope of the luminosity function at faint magnitudes , a point which we shall justify more formally below .",

    "all surveys used to construct our luminosity function satisfy the latter requirement . ]",
    "the fraction @xmath178 is thus insensitive to the limiting magnitude of the field .",
    "this insensitivity justifies our assertion that a kuiper cliff would not break the luminosity function at any particular magnitude .",
    "it also allows us to easily estimate how many detections beyond 50 au we might expect . for @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath176 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 ( constant dispersion in @xmath166 and @xmath39 ) , the fraction of objects outside",

    ", we might therefore expect @xmath1410 to reside beyond 50 au .",
    "eight of these ten would be located between 50 and 70 au .",
    "while these rough considerations do not convincingly implicate a kuiper cliff , they do argue more strongly against a sudden rise by factors of 3 or more in the surface number density between 50 and 70 au ( a nearby `` kuiper wall '' ) . keeping the size distribution fixed and multiplying",
    "the surface density by 3 beyond 50 au would demand that @xmath1425% of all detected classical kbos reside in such a wall , in contrast to the 0% found to date .",
    "nonetheless , there are a number of ways the present lack of detections may still accord with a massive outer classical belt .",
    "the size distribution of objects may change dramatically past 50 au .",
    "for instance , it might be that only a few large objects exist between 50 and 70 au .",
    "this may plausibly be the result of runaway accretion unimpeded by the presence of neptune . alternatively ,",
    "if only objects smaller than @xmath1430 km populate the outer belt , detecting them is a task better suited to occultation surveys than to searches relying on reflected light .",
    "our main results are as follows .    1 .",
    "we discovered 2 new kuiper belt objects in a single keck lris field .",
    "one object at @xmath1 was found by blinking individual frames .",
    "it lies at a heliocentric distance of @xmath184 and has a diameter @xmath185 .",
    "another object at @xmath3 was discovered by blinking shifted and co - added frames .",
    "for this second object , @xmath4 and @xmath186 .",
    "2 .   we pooled all surveys to construct the cumulative luminosity function from @xmath26 to 27 ( figure [ clfuni ] ) . at the faintest observed magnitude , @xmath187 objects / square degree .",
    "the best - fit slope is @xmath123 , where @xmath188 .",
    "differences in @xmath114 reported in the literature are due mainly to which survey data are incorporated .",
    "values of @xmath189 require the omission of surveys by jl95 , jlc96 , and lj98 .",
    "our kbo luminosity function is consistent with a power - law size distribution with differential size index @xmath11 for objects having diameters 50500 km within 50 au .",
    "the distribution is such that the smallest objects possess most of the surface area , but the largest bodies contain the bulk of the mass . by extrapolating outside the observed range of sizes , we estimate to order - of - magnitude that @xmath12 and @xmath13 comet progenitors lie between 30 and 50 au .",
    "though our estimated size index is that of a dohnanyi - like distribution , the interpretation that catastrophic collisions are responsible is questionable .",
    "impact strengths against catastrophic disruption and dispersal probably increase strongly with size for objects greater than @xmath1410 km in diameter , whereas the derivation by dohnanyi ( 1969 ) assumes impact strength to be independent of size .",
    "lifetimes against catastrophic dispersal of kbos having diameters 50500 km exceed the age of the solar system by at least 2 orders of magnitude in the present - day belt , assuming bodies consist of competent rock .",
    "4 .   a greater than threefold rise in the surface density of the kuiper belt just beyond 50 au would imply that more than 25% of detected objects lie outside that distance , assuming objects are distributed similarly in size at all distances .",
    "the absence of detections past 50 au in the present sample of @xmath14100 kbos argues against this picture . a massive outer belt may still be possible if only a few large objects exist between 50 and 70 au , or if only objects smaller than @xmath1430 km exist in the outer belt .",
