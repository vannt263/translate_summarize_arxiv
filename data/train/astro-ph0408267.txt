    "large - scale bars are ubiquitous in present - day spirals , with reported optical bar fractions of @xmath2 30 % for both strong and weak bars ( e.g. , eskridge 2002aa , hereafter es02 ; @xmath6 3 ) .",
    "such bars can drive the dynamical evolution of disk galaxies by redistributing mass and angular momentum .",
    "in particular , they are believed to efficiently drive gas from the outer disk of galaxies into the inner kpc via gravitational torques .",
    "there is mounting observational evidence for bar - driven gas inflow .",
    "observations of cold or ionized gas velocity fields show evidence for shocks and non - circular motions along the large - scale stellar bar ( e.g. , regan , vogel , & teuben 1997 ) .",
    "barred galaxies show shallower metallicity gradients across their galactic disks than unbarred ones ( martin & roy 1994 ) .",
    "co(@xmath7=10 ) interferometric surveys show that , on average , the molecular gas central concentration in the inner kpc is higher in barred than in unbarred galaxies ( sakamoto 1999 ) .",
    "once gas reaches the central regions of bars and builds up large densities comparable to the toomre critical density for the onset of gravitational instabilities , intense starbursts are triggered ( jogee 2004a ) .",
    "the frequency of large - scale stellar bars is in fact significantly higher in starburst galaxies than in normal galaxies ( hawarden 96 ; hunt & malkan 99 ) , while the question of whether seyferts have an excess of large - scale bars remains under investigation ( regan 1997 ; knapen 2000 ; laurikainen 2004 ) .",
    "although bars in the local universe are fairly well studied , several fundamental aspects of bar - driven galaxy evolution remain open :    * when and how did bars form ?",
    "are they a recent ( z@xmath80.7 ) phenomenon or were they abundant 10 gyr ago ?",
    "two conflicting results have been reported to date .",
    "abraham ( 1999 ) claim a dramatic decline in the rest - frame optical bar fraction ( @xmath0 ) at @xmath5  0.7 , based on wfpc2 images of a small sample of @xmath2 50 moderately inclined spirals in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) .",
    "they find @xmath0 drops from @xmath2 24% at @xmath9  0.20.6 to below 5% at @xmath5  0.7 . a second study ( sheth 2003 ) , based on nicmos images of the hdf , report an _ observed bar fraction of 5% at @xmath4 0.71.1 . out of 95 galaxies in this redshift interval , they find four large bars with a mean semi - major axis @xmath10 of 12 kpc ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "since nicmos has a large effective psf , this study fails to detect smaller bars which , at least locally , constitutes the majority of bars ( see @xmath6 3 ) .",
    "the authors argue that their observed bar fraction of 5% at @xmath1 0.7 is at least comparable to the local fraction of large ( 12 kpc ) bars , and thus , by extrapolation , the overall optical bar fraction over all bar sizes ( 1.5 - 15 kpc ) probably does not decline at @xmath1 0.7 .",
    "this conclusion suffers from small number statistics and relies heavily on the extrapolation over bar sizes .",
    "_ * are bars long - lived or do they dissolve and reform over a hubble time ?",
    "early studies ( e.g. , hasan & norman 1990 ; norman , sellwood , & hasan 1996 ) proposed that once a large central mass concentration ( cmc ) builds up in the inner 100 pc of a galaxy , for instance via bar - driven gas inflow , it will destroy or weaken the bar by inducing chaotic orbits and reducing bar - supporting orbits .",
    "subsequently , athanassoula ( 2002 ) found that in simulations with live halos , bars are more difficult to destroy due to resonant angular momentum exchange .",
    "shen & sellwood ( 2004 ) find that in purely stellar @xmath12-body simulations , the bar is quite robust to cmcs .",
    "furthermore , after a bar is destroyed by a cmc , the disk left behind is dynamically hot , and does not readily reform a new bar unless it is cooled significantly .",
    "recently , bournaud & combes ( 2002 ) proposed that bars are destroyed primarily due to the reciprocal torques of gas on the stars in the bar ( rather than by the cmc _ per se _ ) . in their models",
    ", bars can dissolve and reform recurrently over timescales @xmath13 34 gyr , provided the galaxy accretes sufficient cold gas over a hubble time . *",
    "bar - driven evolutionary scenarios purport that bars may transform late - type spirals into intermediate types ( e.g. , scd to sbc ) via gas inflows which build pseudo - bulges , and via bending instabilities ( e.g. , sellwood 1993 ) or vertical ilrs ( e.g. , combes 1990 ) which drive stars to large scale height into a bulge - like configuration . at intermediate redshifts ,",
    "katz & weinberg ( 2002 ) suggest bars can solve the dark matter halo cusp - core controversy . while there is a wealth of circumstantial evidence",
    "( see review by kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) consistent with bar - driven secular evolution , no systematic tests of this picture have been made either at local or intermediate redshifts .    using @xmath2 8,300 galaxies with superb @xmath3 images and accurate redshifts over @xmath4  0.21.1 ( corresponding to lookback times @xmath14 of @xmath2  2.58 gyr ) from the * g*alaxy * e*volution from * m*orphologies and * s*eds ( gems;rix 2004 ; @xmath6 2 ) survey ,",
    "we have started a comprehensive study of the properties ( fractions , sizes , strengths ) of bars as a function of redshift , and host galaxy properties .",
    "the gems bar project will constrain how bars evolve and impact the structural evolution of galaxies over the last 8 gyr , with the eventual goal of resolving some of the above open issues .",
    "we describe here our methodology , early results , and upcoming highlights .",
    "these findings are described in more detail in jogee 2004b .",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath15 and a hubble constant @xmath16 = 70 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 throughout this paper .",
    "gems ( rix 2004 ) is a two - color ( f606w and f850lp ) imaging survey with the @xmath3 advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) of a large - area ( 800 arcmin@xmath18 or @xmath19 ) field centered on the @xmath20 deep field south ( cdf - s ) . the limiting 5@xmath21 depth for compact sources is m@xmath22(f606w)=28.3 and m@xmath22(f850lp)=27.1 .",
    "acs imaging from the goods project ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) is used in the central quarter field .",
    "gems provides morphologies for @xmath23 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath4 0.21.1 where seds and accurate redshifts ( @xmath24/(1 + @xmath25 ) @xmath2  0.02 ) down to @xmath26= 24 exist from the combo-17 project ( wolf 2003 ) .",
    "the dataset are further enhanced by panchromatic @xmath20 , @xmath27 , and ground - based observations covering the x - rays to the far - ir and radio .",
    "the gems acs dataset offer many advantages for studying bars , compared to earlier wfpc2/nic3 imaging surveys . the dataset provide a factor of 100 improvement in number statistics , an effective acs psf which is 23 times better than the wfcp2 and nic3 psfs , and redder wavelength coverage and sensitivity via the acs f850lp filter / ccd combination .",
    "the superior psf allows us to probe bars down to small sizes ( @xmath28 or 1 kpc ; see @xmath6 3 ) .",
    "finally , the large area ( @xmath29 hdf area ) coverage reduces the effect of cosmic variance .",
    "we identify and characterize bars out to @xmath9  1.1 by performing isophotal analyses of the f606w ( ) and f850lp ( ) images using an automated iterative version of of the iraf stsdas `` ellipse '' routine .",
    "isophotal fits are a good guide to the underlying orbital structure of a galaxy and provide a robust way of identifying and characterizing bars ( e.g. , wozniak 1995 ; jogee 2002 ) .",
    "a bar is identified by its characteristic signature in the radial profiles of ellipticity ( @xmath30 ) , surface brightness , and position angle ( pa ) , as illustrated in figs .",
    "1a and 1b .",
    "the ellipticity is required to rise smoothly to a _",
    "global maximum above 0.25 while the pa has a plateau over the region dominated by the @xmath31 orbits , followed by a drop @xmath32 0.1 in @xmath30 as the bar - to - disk transition occurs .",
    "the ellipticity , pa , and semi - major axis for both the bar and outer disk can be identified from these profiles , thereby allowing the profiles to be subsequently deprojected to derive the intrinsic bar strength and size .",
    "we also use the disk ellipticity and inferred inclination @xmath33 to reject all galaxies with @xmath34  @xmath35 , since morphological classification is unreliable in highly inclined galaxies . _    .2 in     0.3 and 0.4 .",
    "( top panel : left to right ) , and at @xmath9 0.5 and 0.9 ( bottom panel : left to right ) , width=316 ]",
    "we use two approaches to characterize the optical bar fraction @xmath0 .",
    "the first is to identify bars in the reddest observed band ( f850lp ) at all redshifts , with the idea that redder wavelengths are less impacted by extinction , and consequently better trace the old stellar potential .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is that different , increasingly bluer rest - frame bands are then traced in the two redshift bins of interest ( 0.24@xmath360.65 and 0.65@xmath361.1 ) as illustrated in table 1a .",
    "a complementary approach , illustrated in table 1b , is to use both f606w and f850lp images in order to work in a fixed rest - frame band ( @xmath37/@xmath38 ) and avoid significant bandpass shifting .",
    "we present early results based on a subsample of 600 galaxies distributed in the overlap area of gems and goods .",
    "figure 2 illustrates examples of intermediate redshift galaxies with bars and spiral arms in this sample . while being only a small fraction of the total gems dataset ,",
    "this sample is 36 times larger than previous wfpc2 and nic3 samples used to study bars in the hdf .",
    "an inclination cutoff of @xmath34  @xmath35 and a magnitude cutoff of @xmath39 mag are imposed in order to ensure accurate photometric redshifts , spectral typing , and reliable morphological analyses .",
    "galaxies were assigned e / s0 and ( spiral+ starburst ) types based on comparing their rest frame @xmath40 colors and absolute @xmath41 magnitudes with template seds from kinney et al ( 1996 ) and coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 ) .",
    "we imposed an absolute magnitude cutoff of @xmath42 -19 .",
    "the rest - frame optical bar fraction @xmath0 in a given redshift bin was taken as ( @xmath43/@xmath44 ) , where @xmath43 is the number of bars detected , and @xmath44 is the number of spirals and starbursts .",
    "an alternative approach involves using the single fit sersic index @xmath45 to identify disk galaxies as the main contributor to @xmath44 .",
    "our exciting result , based on the first method , are highlighted below :    * _ we find that the rest - frame optical bar fraction @xmath0 remains constant at @xmath2  30% over @xmath4  0.21.1 or lookback times of @xmath2  2.59 gyr .",
    "in particular , we do not find evidence of a dramatic decline in @xmath0 to below 5% at @xmath46 .",
    "this result holds whether we choose to use the reddest observed band ( f850lp ) in both redshift bins ( table 1a ) , or choose to work in the same fixed rest - frame band ( table 1b ) . to further test the robustness of the results",
    ", we repeated the analyses treating the spiral and starburst types separately , and found no change .",
    "we also performed an extra - consistency check by using the f606w images over the 0.65@xmath361.1 interval to estimate the bar fraction ( @xmath47 ) in the rest - frame uv .",
    "strong bars are not expected to be delineated by recent massive sf as the strong shocks on their leading edges are not conducive to sf . as expected , the estimated @xmath47 is much lower ( 5% ) than @xmath0 .",
    "the results on @xmath0 , therefore , seem quite robust .",

    "the fact that we not identify weak ( 0.25 @xmath55 0.4 ) bars at @xmath4  0.61.1 ( fig .",

    "one possibility is that bars at @xmath4 1 were on average stronger than local ones ( e.g. , bournaud & combes 2002 ) .",
