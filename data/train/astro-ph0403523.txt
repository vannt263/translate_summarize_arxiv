    "the thermal - dominant state ends on day 149 when a transition begins back to the low / hard state .    in the transition from the low / hard state to the thermal - dominant state starting day 87 ) , the disk black - body normalization begins near 15 and rises , implying an increasing inner disk radius .",
    "the opposite occurs on the transition back to the low / hard state .",
    "this is counter to the expectation that the inner - disk radius is large during the low / hard state , and near the inner most stable orbit in the thermal - dominant state ( e.g. , esin et al .",
    "this rise and fall may be due to systematic problems with our spectral fits : we detect only the high - energy tail of the thermal spectrum . in fits",
    "where the column density , disk temperature and flux are all free to vary , these parameters are , therefore , highly coupled . by fixing the column density to the value found with the bepposax data , we have reduced this coupling , but could be biasing the solution .",
    "there is a strong correlation between the flux associated with the broad line feature and that of the power law component during the early stages of the first outburst episode .",
    "one possible interpretation of this feature is that it is the fluorescent fe k@xmath35 emission produced by the reprocessing of the hard x - ray photons by cooler material close to the central object .",
    "the line centroid energies were somewhat lower than what is expected for neutral iron ( 6.4 kev ) .",
    "this may suggest that what we observe is primarily the red wing of doppler shifted neutral fe k@xmath35 in a keplerian accretion .",
    "this was seen also in 4u 1630@xmath147 ( cui , chen & zhang 1999 ) and in xte j1748@xmath1288 ( miller et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "esin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have presented a model to explain the states of x - ray novae . in the quiescent and low / hard state",
    "a thin accretion disk is present but truncated at a large inner radius . within this radius",
    "there is an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) which is a hot and radiatively inefficient flow where most of the thermal energy generated is advected onto the black hole rather then being radiated . above",
    "the accretion disk is a hot corona , which is a continuation of the advection dominated flow , which produces a power - law spectral component in the low / hard state by comptonization .",
    "this model does not incorporate the jets which are responsible for the radio emission now known to be associated with the low / hard state .",
    "markoff , falcke & fender ( 2001 ) have proposed that these jets also produce the power - law component via synchrotron radiation . in their model a standard accretion disk transitions at an inner radius of @xmath50 km to a hot adaf - like flow which feeds the jet . the hard x - rays are synchrotron radiation produced in a shock acceleration region some @xmath51 km above the disk plane .",
    "the radio emission is from beyond this region .    while providing successful fits of a multi - wavelength spectrum , neither of these models yet consider dynamical changes in the flow or attempt to explain the power - spectra seen in the different states .",
    "the high amplitude variability seen in the low - hard state requires changes in emissivity that are spatially coherent over most of the emission region .",
    "it is tempting to associate the qpo s seen in the low / hard state with the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the thin accretion disk . yet",
    "while this is plausible in the low - hard state , the qpo in xte j1908 + 094 persists into the intermediate state , where the inner disk radius inferred from spectral fits imply frequencies much larger than those observed .",
