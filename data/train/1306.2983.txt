    "the nature of the rapid increase in viscosity as liquids are cooled toward the glass transition is the subject of many theoretical approaches , however there is no consensus on its fundamental mechanism  @xcite .",
    "one plausible scenario is the emergence of self - induced memory effects upon supercooling of liquids , which causes slow dynamics  @xcite .",
    "however the recent discovery of dynamic heterogeneities , i.e. , spatial heterogeneities in the relaxation dynamics that emerge on supercooling @xcite , is suggestive of the importance of a growing dynamic length scale in the slowing down approaching the glass transition .",
    "in addition to these dynamical phenomenona , the idea of a structural change leading to vitrification has a long history  @xcite .",
    "sir charles frank suggested that upon supercooling liquids would form polyhedral motifs such as icosahedra that do not fill space . a related approach , geometric frustration  @xcite , suggests that the glass transition can be thought of as a manifestation of a crystallisation - like transition that would occur in curved space ( where the structural motifs tessellate  @xcite ) , but that growth of the `` crystal nuclei '' of polyhedral motifs is frustrated in euclidean space . another approach based on frustration against crystallization ( due to random disorder effects or competing orderings )",
    "@xcite addresses the origin of slow dynamics and the physical factors controlling glass - forming ability within the same framework .",
    "it has become clear that a range of glass formers exhibit a change in structure upon the emergence of slow dynamics  @xcite , and it is debated as to whether there exists a static lengthscale that underlies the growing lengthscale for the dynamical correlations .",
    "broadly speaking two types of structure have been identified : spatially extendable crystal - like ordering  @xcite , and non - extendable polyhedral ordering  @xcite . for the former",
    "it has been suggested that critical - like fluctuations of crystalline order are the origin of dynamic heterogeneities in certain classes of supercooled liquid  @xcite .",
    "the latter concerns particles organised into polyhedra that can not tile euclidean space due to geometrical constraints  @xcite .",
    "instead they form ramified structures with a fractal dimension that is less that the dimensionality of the system , i.e. non - extendable ordering .",
    "some metallic glasses have been shown to exhibit this second type of ordering  @xcite .",
    "the exact relationship of the polyhedral order to the dynamic heterogeneities is unclear , however measurements have shown that the polyhedral domains are slow to relax  @xcite . although the two types of orderings have a different nature , we note that both are induced to lower the free energy locally in the situation where its global minimization ( crystallization ) is prohibited  @xcite . in relation to this , we note that even polyhedral ordering often has some connection to crystalline order , e.g. , for example icosahedra in quasicrystal approximants  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even in the case where extendable order dominates slow dynamics , non - extendable polyhedral order competes with extendable crystal - like order in systems such as 2d spin liquids  @xcite and polydisperse hard spheres  @xcite .",
    "one of the main difficulties with identifying structural correlations in supercooled liquids is that it is not known _ a priori _ which ( if any ) type of static order is important for the dynamic slowdown .",
    "frequently studies have employed structure detection methods , such as voronoi face analysis  @xcite , common neighbour analysis  @xcite , bond orientational order analysis  @xcite , or the topological cluster classification employed here  @xcite that search for predefined types of structural `` motif '' and see how the numbers change as a function of temperature  @xcite . however",
    "recently a number of `` order - agnostic '' schemes have been devised to identify structural correlations without first having to define what structures will be searched for  @xcite . in relation to this , it has recently been pointed out that for accessing such hidden structural ordering in apparently random structures it is crucial to focus on many - body correlations  @xcite .    to strengthen the link between structure and glassy behaviour three types of evidence have been presented .",
    "firstly , many - body structural correlation functions have been presented that clearly show structural changes occur on supercooling towards the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "secondly , dynamically slow regions have been correlated with different types of local ordering  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the presence of structural and dynamic length scales that grow similarly has been sought  @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by strong evidence that , for sufficient cooling ( which leads to relaxation timescales that may or may not be accessible to computer simulations as we employ here ) , an increasing dynamical lengthscale necessitates an increasing lower bound to a structural lengthscale  @xcite .",
    "the case of growing structural and dynamic length scales is controversial .",
    "one of us has identified a direct correspondence between the growing dynamical and structural lengthscales in polydisperse systems displaying crystal - like ordering  @xcite , while others have claimed that structural lengthscales are decorrelated from the dynamic lengthscales and only grow weakly on cooling  @xcite .",
    "local structural ordering has yet to be found in some glassforming systems . for these systems",
    "no one - to - one correspondence between an order - agnostic structural lengthscale and the dynamical lengthscale has been found  @xcite , but static perturbation analysis has suggested a growing structural lengthscale  @xcite .",
    "the kob - andersen binary lennard - jones system  @xcite of interest here is known to display polyhedral ordering  @xcite . in this system , weakly growing structural lengthscales have been identified by the order - agnostic `` point - to - set '' analysis  @xcite , while other approaches using static perturbation of inherent structures  @xcite and finite size scaling  @xcite find a stronger increase in static lengthscales .",
    "the polyhedral ordering in the kob - andersen mixture  @xcite , take the form of the bicapped square antiprism [ `` 11a '' in the topological cluster classification ( tcc ) nomenclature  @xcite owing to its original identification as minimum energy cluster of the morse potential  @xcite ] .",
    "this structure has been linked to slow dynamics  @xcite and frustrates crystallisation , which in the ka mixture occurs spontaneously by phase separation into two face - centred cubic lattices  @xcite .",
    "we note that crystals based on 11a could in principle coexist with other structures [ the stoichimetry of the 11a crystal with a small particle in the centre ( see section [ sectionclustercomposition ] and fig .",
    "[ figgcomp ] ) is not compatible with the ka mixture  @xcite ] .",
    "another possibility is four - fold symmetric crystals which have been predicted as low - lying energy minima for the ka mixture  @xcite .",
    "an order parameter associated with the formation of 11a clusters has been shown to control the dynamical phase transition in trajectory - space , a hallmark of dynamical facilitation theory for the glass transition  @xcite , indicating that the transition has both structural and dynamical character  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ultra - stable glasses of the ka mixture have been found to be rich in 11a  @xcite .",
    "here we study the spatial correlations between the domains of 11a in the supercooled liquid .",
    "we consider the lifetimes of a multitude of structures in the supercooled liquid using the tcc algorithm .",
    "we detail our simulation protocol in section [ sectionsimulationdetails ] , and briefly review the ka model s dynamical behaviour in section [ sectiondynamicalbehaviour ] .",
    "we use the tcc to identify any structural changes that occur in these mixtures on cooling towards the glass transition in section [ sectionstructuralanalysis ] .",
    "we then study in section [ sectionclusterlifetimedistributions ] the lifetimes of the clusters that are found at deeply supercooled state points in order to gauge which structures are likely candidates to be associated with slow domains of dynamic heterogeneities .",
    "finally we analyse how correlation lengths for the domains of structured particles are related to the growing dynamic lengthscale in section [ sectioncorrelationlengths ] before concluding .",

    "we analyse how the particles in the supercooled liquids are structured using the topological cluster classification algorithm .",

    "it is clear from these order parameters that the liquid sees continuous changes in local structure as it is cooled .",
    "the majority of clusters see an increase in their numbers upon cooling .",
    "all of the particles are identified within certain simple structures such as the 5a triangular bipyramid irrespective of temperature , while other more complicated clusters , such are 10k , 11b and hcp , are almost never seen .",
    "given the variety and range of structural changes that occur , it is not clear _ a priori _ which of the structures , if any , are important for the formation of dynamic heterogeneities on cooling .",
    "it should not be assumed that just because structural changes occur within the supercooled regime that they are responsible for the formation of dynamic heterogeneities , as structural changes also occur in the arrhenius regime which is not characterised by glassy behaviour .",
    "the numbers of particles within 11a , 11w , 12b , 12e and 12k clusters show the largest relative increases in the super - arrhenius regime .",
    "moreover , the rate of increase in these clusters grows upon further supercooling .",
    "we also find clusters in which almost all particles participate , while other clusters are only seen in trace quantities .",
    "in general the trend for clusters where @xmath46 changes significantly on cooling is for it to increase monotonically .",
    "however this is not always the case , as seen for the numbers of particles within 9a and 9x clusters which decrease on cooling .",
    "the question remains as to how to determine the contribution of the different structures to the glassy behaviour and dynamical heterogeneities of the supercooled liquid .      in order to identify",
    "which clusters might be relevant to the slow dynamics , we employ the _ dynamic _ topological cluster classification algorithm  @xcite to measure the lifetimes of the different tcc clusters at the lowest temperature state point .",
    "a lifetime @xmath47 is assigned to each `` instance '' of a cluster , where an instance is defined by the unique indices of the particles within the cluster and the type of tcc cluster .",
    "each instance cluster occurs between two frames in the trajectory and the lifetime is the time difference between these frames .",
    "any periods where the instance is not detected by the tcc algorithm are shorter than @xmath32 in length , and no subset of the particles becomes un - bonded from the others during the lifetime of the instance .",
    "the measurement of lifetimes for all the instances of clusters in these @xmath15 simulations is intensive in terms of the quantity of memory required to store the instances , and the number of searches through the memory required by the algorithm each time an instance of a cluster is found to see if it existed earlier in the trajectory .",
    "therefore we do not measure lifetimes for the clusters where @xmath48 , since the vast majority of particles are found within such clusters and it is not immediately clear how dynamic heterogeneities could be related to structures that are pervasive throughout the whole liquid .     for the lowest temperature state point @xmath49 .",
    "[ figgplt],width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ figgplt ] we plot the lifetime autocorrelation function @xmath50 for @xmath49 . figure [ figgplt ] clearly shows that the most persistent or the longest lived of the different types of clusters are the 11a bicapped square antiprisms .",
    "all other clusters display lifetime autocorrelation functions that decay more quickly than 11a .",
    "the long - time tail of the 11a autocorrelation function indicates that some of these clusters preserve their local structure on timescales far longer than @xmath51 . as we shall see below",
    ", this effect is enhanced when the 11a group into domains .",
    "the two next - slowest decaying clusters are 11w and 12k .",
    "12k is a ka minimum energy cluster , formed by bonding an additional particle to 11a .",
    "there is a high degree of overlap between the 11w clusters and the 11a clusters as their bonding is similar , and only small fluctuations are required for an 11a to be reclassified as an 11w .",
    "however the faster - decaying clusters also contain ka minimum energy clusters , for example 13k and 10k .",
    "moreover the lifetimes of all cluster types hold no simple relationship to their size and frequency of occurrence .",
    "for example the @xmath52 particle 11f cluster is much more numerous than 11a , yet displays far quicker decay of @xmath53 .",
    "there is also no monotonic trend in the lifetime of the ground state clusters with the cluster size , as the 10k and 13k decay faster than the 12k and 11a .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate that the average lifetime of each type of cluster is a property of the local ordering of the particles rather than the size of the cluster or its pervasiveness .",
    "the fast initial drops of @xmath53 reflect the existence of large numbers of clusters with lifetimes @xmath54 .",
    "the lifetimes of these clusters are comparable to the timescale for beta - relaxation where the particles fluctuate within their cage of neighbours . it could be argued that these clusters arise spuriously due to the microscopic fluctuations within the cage , and that the short - lived clusters are not representative of the actual liquid structure .",
    "however almost no 11a are found at higher temperatures , cf .",
    "[ figgkancn](b ) , where microscopic fluctuations in the beta - regime also occur .",
    "we have not yet found a way to distinguish between the short and long - lived 11a structurally , so we conclude that the measured distribution of 11a lifetimes , which includes short - lived clusters , is representative of the true lifetime distribution .",
    "however , given the structural similarity of 11a and 11w , small fluctuations leading to reclassification could contribute to the drop at short times .",
    "we will see below that as 11a overlap , one particle may be a member of multiple clusters and that the majority of particles found in short - lived 11a also participate in longer - lived 11a . in other words",
    "short- and long - lived 11a mainly lie in the same regions of the liquid .",
    "another interpretation for the initial drop in @xmath55 of the clusters is that our intuition that there is constant local structure in the beta - regime , which then relaxes on the timescale of the alpha - regime , is incorrect",
    ". it may be the case that microscopic ballistic and `` cage - rattling '' motions are enough to reorder local structures without relying on the `` cage - hopping '' motions of the alpha - regime .",
    "it has been seen in previous studies that deeply supercooled liquids can crystallise on a timescale before the diffusive range of the mean squared displacement is reached , and occurs with most particles moving by less than one diameter  @xcite .",
    "those results demonstrate that significant changes in local structure ( i.e. liquid - like to crystalline ) are possible with only small movements of the particles , which could explain the initial drops of @xmath53 that occur on a timescale @xmath56 .",
    "the structural analysis above was performed by treating all particles identically with the tcc algorithm .",
    "here we examine the composition of the 11a bicapped square antiprisms in terms of @xmath20- and @xmath57-species .",
    "the 11a cluster consists of a central particle surrounded by 10 outer ( or shell ) particles .",
    "we find that the central particle is a @xmath57-specie in @xmath58 of all instances of 11a clusters .",
    "this is a different composition than the crystal structures found to be low - lying energy minima for the ka mixture  @xcite , and may be related to the stoichiometry of the system .",
    "thus the 11a we find are unrelated to any underlying crystal .    .",

    "the difference between @xmath63 and @xmath64 indicates that only @xmath65 of the particles are members of 11a with @xmath66 and _ not _ a member of an 11a with a longer lifetime as well .",

    "the msd is defined as the ensemble average @xmath67 for the subset of particles of interest ( indexed by @xmath68 ) .",
    "all of the particles within 11a relax more slowly than the system - wide average ( black line ) , and the time they take to attain diffusive motion increases as the lifetime of the 11a in which they participate in at @xmath69 increases .",
    "in other words the longer the lifetime of the 11a cluster , the slower the particles become . since some 11a",
    "last for very long times [ fig .",

    "the first method allows for direct comparison with the dynamic lengthscale @xmath0 .",
    "we define a structure factor restricted to the particles identified within 11a : @xmath115\\exp[i \\textbf{k } \\cdot \\textbf{r}_l(t_0 ) ] \\rangle , \\label{eqs11a}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the number of particles in 11a clusters .",
    "we then fit the ornstein - zernike equation ( eq . [ eqoz ] ) to the low-@xmath117 behaviour of the angularly - averaged @xmath118 in order to extract a structural correlation length @xmath119 .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ figglengths ] .",
    "this procedure is akin to the calculation of the dynamic lengthscale @xmath0 : first a structure factor is calculated from a selected fraction of the particles ( either immobile or structured ) , and the ornstein - zernike expression used to extract a correlation length .",
    "the second lengthscale we consider for the structured particles is derived from the radius of gyration of the domains of clusters .",
    "we define @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the radius of gyration of a single cluster , @xmath122 is the ensemble average of the domain size , @xmath1 is the number of particles in the cluster , and @xmath123 is the exponent of the power law fitted to @xmath72 versus @xmath71 .",
    "this correlation length does not probe the correlations between the domains , as per @xmath119 , rather it characterises the growth in size of the domains on cooling until a percolation transition is reached .",
    "the temperature behaviour of the different correlation lengths is shown in fig .",
    "[ figglengths ] .",
    "all three correlation lengths increase on cooling , however the manner in which each of the lengths increases is quite different .",
    "the main result is that the growth in the dynamic correlation length @xmath0 is not matched by the growth in the structural correlation length @xmath119 .",
    "thus we do not find one - to - one correspondence between the behaviour of structural and dynamic correlation lengths .",
    "the fact that different behaviour between the dynamic and static lengths is found is in agreement with some recent studies on 2d and 3d systems  @xcite , however we note that a one - to - one correspondence in the growth in a lengthscale relating to static crystalline order and the dynamic correlation length for polydisperse quasi - hard sphere systems has been found  @xcite .",
    "the structural order we find is distinct from the crystalline structure and is thought to frustrate crystallisation .",
    "we note that in the studies on 3d systems that have found one - to - one correspondence between the structural and dynamical lengthscales  @xcite , the relative increase in the static lengthscales going from state points in the arrhenius regime to into the supercooled regime is no more than a factor of @xmath124 .",
    "increases of comparable magnitude have been found in studies using point - to - set measures  @xcite , and more indirect methods  @xcite rather than focussing on explicit structures . in fig .",
    "[ figglengths ] our static length @xmath119 shows an increase of the same order between arrhenius and supercooled state points , however the increase in @xmath0 is relatively much greater ( factor of @xmath125 or more between high and low @xmath30 ) .",
    "we note a recent 2d study that suggests one - to - one correspondence in lengthscales for crystalline order and dynamic heterogeneities on quasi - hard spheres breaks down with the addition of attractions between the particles  @xcite .",
    "however , we also note that 3d polydisperse hard - sphere and lennard - jones systems have the same link between the correlation length of crystal - like order and slow dynamics , albeit over a limited range of correlation length  @xcite .",
    "these points need to be clarified in the future .",
    "the structured domains form rarefied networks with @xmath74 .",
    "these networks do not fill space , whereas it is thought that any critical - like nature of the dynamic heterogeneities would imply that the domains have @xmath126  @xcite .",
    "therefore geometrically it appears that the domains of slow and structured particles may be different , at least at the state points we have accessed .",
    "moreover the number of particles in the domains is unlikely to coincide across a range of temperatures , as the @xmath116 for the structured particles increase monotonically on approaching the glass transition , while the number of particles selected by @xmath127 is relatively constant as a function of temperature .    here",
    "we note that mosayebi et al .",
    "@xcite found behaviour consistent with critical - like static correlations in the same system as ours , which implies @xmath128 .",
    "this seems to suggest that 11a together with other clusters or kinetically pinned particles may correspond to their static structures with solid - like nature .",
    "now the temperature range over which we were able to equilibrate our simulations is less than that for which mosayebi _ et al . _  @xcite present data .",
    "indeed over our range of temperature , the relative increase in static lengthscale they measure is consistent with ours .",
    "however , since our @xmath129 , our findings are not consistent with ising - like criticality , although critical - like behaviour at lower temperatures than we have been able to access can not be ruled out .",
    "we also note that the structural motifs investigated here are of intrinsically of discrete nature , whereas the structural measures showing critical - like behaviours ( @xmath128 ) , such as bond orientational order @xcite and static structures @xcite have a continuous nature .",
    "the msd of the 11a particles indicates that there is not a one - to - one correspondence between the particles selected in @xmath110 and @xmath130 .",
    "the particles selected by @xmath131 for @xmath110 all have @xmath132 strictly ( by the definition of @xmath131 ) . however , as can been seen from the red line in fig .",
    "[ figg11adyn](b ) , the msd of the 11a particles over the same timescale is @xmath133 .",
    "only the particles in the longest - lived 11a clusters [ blue lines in fig . [ figg11adyn](b ) ] have squared displacements over @xmath102 comparable to the immobile particles on which @xmath110 is measured .",
    "thus on this basis direct correspondence between @xmath0 and @xmath134 should not necessarily be expected .",
    "we note that this might also be related to the effects of low - frequency vibrational modes  @xcite .",
    "note @xmath135 has been shown to exhibit dependence upon system size for @xmath136  @xcite .",
    "we expect that such effects are reasonably small here , and have taken care to only consider temperatures where all our measured lengths are smaller than the system size . while system size effects can not be ruled out , we do not believe these make a significant impact on the conclusions we draw .",
    "the lengthscale @xmath137 indicates how the size of the domains grows on cooling . in our related study on the wahnstrm binary lennard - jones glass",
    "former  @xcite , where the concentration of clusters was higher , a percolating network of icosahedra was formed . in a study on the kob - andersen model considered here",
    "@xcite , some of us found evidence for an increase in the population of 11a clusters at lower temperatures than we have been able to access here .",
    "thus if the 11a clusters percolate , this would suggest a diverging structural lengthscale at a temperature higher than either the vft or mct temperatures ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively ) . in any case , percolating domains of 11a clusters do not imply structural arrest since each cluster has a finite lifetime .",
    "this scenario contrasts with colloidal gels where a percolating network of local structures leads to dynamic arrest  @xcite .",
    "we also note that fig . [",
    "figgkafrac](f ) strongly indicates that the effect of the domains of clustered particles on the surrounding liquid extends around one particle diameter from the domains .",
    "this shows that the dynamical effect of the structured particles is hierarchical and not solely limited to the structured domains themselves .",
    "however the correlation lengths we measured from a structure factor of the domains and their first nearest neighbours was no greater than the lengthscale @xmath119 for the domains themselves .",
    "thus the question remains as to the most appropriate structural ( and dynamical ) correlation length to explain the viscous slowing down in supercooled liquids , and how order - specific correlation lengths , such as @xmath137 and @xmath119 , are related to order - agnostic structural correlation lengths  @xcite .",
    "we conclude this discussion with the following observations .    1 .",
    "static correlation lengths have been measured in a variety of systems .",
    "most seem to grow less strongly than dynamic correlation lengths in the regime accessible to computer simulation ( and real - space colloid experiments )  @xcite .",
    "those that are observed to grow in a way comparable to the dynamic correlation length @xmath0 are often related to crystalline order  @xcite . here",
    "we note that a bond orientational order parameter is a continuous variable , whereas structural motifs are discrete by the definition .",
    "there might also be some effects of low - frequency vibrational modes on the estimation of the dynamical correlation length in our system  @xcite .",
    "these points need further investigation .",
    "we note that geometric frustration suggests a term in @xmath140 to be included in a classical nucleation theory like equation , where @xmath141 is the size of a growing domain of the preferred structure ( 11a here )  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath140 term strongly suppresses growth of such domains , consistent with ramified structures as we ( and others  @xcite ) find . now",
    "the arguments supporting geometric frustration tended to focus on icosahedra , not 11a bicapped square antiprisms as we find here .",
    "however , in our study of the wahnstrm model ( whose local structural motif is the icosahedron )  @xcite , we found very similar behaviour to that reported here . in any case , crystals can be formed of 11a , though not for the 80 - 20 composition of the ka mixture  @xcite , and icosahedra ( with the inclusion of frank - kasper bonds )  @xcite .",
    "assuming crystallisation is avoided , given the presence of such an @xmath140 term , one might enquire as to why growth of polyhedral domains is expected in the first place .",
    "3 .   apart from @xmath0 ,",
    "dynamic correlation lengths have also been measured by other means  @xcite .",
    "in particular , evidence has been found for non - monotonic behaviour of such dynamic correlation lengths around the mode - coupling transition  @xcite .",
    "while @xmath0 itself does not exhibit non - monotonic behaviour as such , there is evidence that a different scaling is followed for quenches below the mode - coupling transition  @xcite .",
    "moreover , that our fit of @xmath0 implies divergence at @xmath142 suggests that some other scaling might be found at lower temperatures than we have accessed . another way to approach the discrepancy in fig .",
    "[ figglengths ] is to enquire whether @xmath0 is the `` right '' dynamical correlation length  @xcite .",
    "one could even speculate that dynamical correlations are enhanced around the mode - coupling transition ( as our results imply , along with those of kob _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , and that at least the lengthscale does not grow significantly at lower temperatures . this would rationalise the estimates of dynamic correlation lengths close to the _ molecular _ glass transition ( some 10 orders of magnitude slower in relaxation time than our simulations are able to access ) which suggest correlation lengths only of a few molecular diameters  @xcite .",
    "however , we should note that there is a possible deficiency of the standard dynamical correlation length @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we point out that the wavenumber dependence of the transport coefficient , viscosity , is a physically appealing method for estimating the intrinsic dynamical correlation length  @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that by studying the lifetimes of different structural orderings within the kob - andersen supercooled liquid , the relatively stable orderings of particles can be detected unambiguously .",
    "this method alleviates some of the difficulties in identifying structural correlations relevant to glassy behaviour from the temperature dependency of the number of particles participating in clusters . the most stable cluster found in the kob - andersen supercooled liquid is the 11a bicapped square antiprism .",
    "the relaxation of particles within these clusters proceeds more slowly as the lifetime of the cluster increases .",
    "this is consistent with previous work based on voronoi polyhedra  @xcite .",
    "the long - lived clusters form rarefied domains on cooling with a fractal dimension @xmath143 , i.e. the structured domains are non - space - filling , at least in the regime we have accessed .",
    "the lifetime of the 11a clusters increases markedly with the size of the domains of these clusters .",
    "the non-11a particles neighbouring these domains have reduced mobility compared to particles further from the domains , suggesting a link between structure and dynamic heterogeneity at this level of detail . in other words ,",
    "the network of 11a clusters acts to `` pin '' its neighbours .",
    "we examined the relationship between the structured domains and the dynamic heterogeneities by considering static and dynamic correlation lengths of structured / slow particles . a static correlation length calculated in a like - for - like manner with the dynamic correlation length",
    "was found to grow moderately on cooling , however its increase was outmatched by the growth in the dynamic correlation length @xmath0 .",
    "the difference in behaviour of the correlation lengths was rationalised by noting that the structured domains grow in a non - space filling manner , and that the correlation between the structured and slow particles is not perfect .",
    "the relationship between the our static and dynamic correlation lengths , and other lengthscales for static order , remains an open question , ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "finally we consider a possible direction for future study .",
    "it has been shown recently that an order parameter associated with the population of 11a clusters can be used to drive a first order transition in an ensemble of trajectories  @xcite .",
    "the susceptibility of the transition to the field coupled to the structural order parameter was found to be higher than when biasing with a field coupled to the dynamical activity , which is the usual method that the transition is accessed .",
    "furthermore a recent study by singh _",
    "_ has shown that `` ultra - stable '' ka glasses prepared by a vapour deposition technique have high numbers of clusters equivalent to 11a polyhedra  @xcite .",
    "together these results provide further evidence for a connection between the atomic level structure , most easily accessed with high - order structural correlation functions , and the glass transition .",
    "the biasing of fields coupled to structural order parameters in trajectory space , and possibly in configuration space as well , thus opens up a new route for the preparation of ultra - stable glassy states  @xcite pertinent to temperatures well below the mode - coupling temperature .",
    "the relaxation times inferred for these states are many orders of magnitude higher than those which can currently be prepared with conventional simulations .",
    "study and characterisation of the properties of these states will shed further light on nature and role of local structure in the glass transition .",
    "in other words , while fig . [ figglengths ]",
    "( like much of the recent literature  @xcite ) indicates a decoupling between structural and dynamical lengthscales , other static and/or dynamical measures might finally lead to coupling of structure and dynamics .",
