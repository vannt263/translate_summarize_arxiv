    "an interesting consequence of the closed cage structure of 60 is that atoms and molecules may be trapped inside , forming endohedral complexes ( `` dopeyballs '' ) .",
    "a variety of such complexes have been produced@xcite where the dopant may be a metallic or a rare gas atom / cluster .",
    "the electronic structure and mechanical stability of two such endohedral rare gas complexes , 60 and 60 , are considered here .",
    "it has previously been noted@xcite that the high symmetry of the 60 cage suggests the following geometrical approximation : the one - electron potential of icosahedral symmetry is replaced with its spherical average .",
    "physically , the nuclear charge together with the charge from the core electrons is smeared out into a thin spherical shell of uniform surface charge density and radius @xmath2 .",
    "such a fictitious molecule `` spherene '' has complete spherical symmetry .    in the case of metallofullerenes such as na@60",
    ", it has been shown@xcite that the equilibrium position of the dopant is not at the center of the cage , consequently reducing the symmetry of the complex . for rare gas dopants , however , it has previously been asserted@xcite that there is no such symmetry reduction .",
    "additionally , previous calculations@xcite on ne@60 indicate that the dopant is stable at the center .",
    "consequently , given the large coordination number of the gas atom and the lack of a distortion from the high symmetry configuration , endohedral rare gas fullerenes seem to be good candidates for the spherical approximation .",
    "the endohedrally - doped spherene is treated in the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "it is anticipated that the highly delocalized @xmath0-electrons of the cage and the closed shell configuration of the gas atom are well - suited to such a statistical description .",
    "this method of treating high symmetry molecules was originally suggested by march@xcite .",
    "the cage is parametrized by the radius @xmath2 and valence electron number @xmath3 , while the gas atom has nuclear charge @xmath4 and an equal number of electrons .",
    "the total electron density is calculated using the thomas - fermi equations , subject to the shell boundary conditions .",
    "the total energy of the system is calculated for a variety of radii .",
    "a stable equilibrium radius is obtained , when the cage self - energy is computed from the system of ionic point charges , rather than from the continuum model .",
    "a method of treating non - spherical corrections is outlined .",
    "lastly , possible central atom distortions are discussed in the context of the bader molecular graphs arising from the electron density .",
    "the nuclear potential from the central atom and the cage atoms can be expanded in a multipole series as @xmath5 @xmath6 is the @xmath7-pole moment , given by @xmath8 where @xmath4 is the atomic number of the rare gas atom of interest . from the icosahedral symmetry of the molecule , it has been shown@xcite that the first three non - vanishing multipole moments are for @xmath90 , 6 , 10 . as the occupied one - electron states have an effective @xmath10 , it is not necessary to consider @xmath11 multipole terms in first order perturbation theory .",
    "the spherical approximation consists of retaining only the @xmath12 term in the multipole expansion .",
    "the error introduced can be estimated by consideration of the relevant dimensionless parameters @xmath13 the following values are found as function of @xmath4 : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . as @xmath18 for @xmath19 , it may be concluded that the spherical approximation is justified for such a high symmetry structure , and one - electron splittings under the true icosahedral symmetry can be treated perturbationally .    with spherical symmetry imposed , the endohedral cluster is quasi - atomic in form .",
    "the sixty @xmath0-electrons of the cage plus the @xmath4 electrons of the central atom are now treated in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation where the @xmath20 electrons see a point charge of @xmath21 at the origin and a uniform shell of charge @xmath22 and radius @xmath2 .",
    "the methodology follows that of march@xcite .    at temperature @xmath23 , the dimensionless tf equation without exchange",
    "is given by @xmath24 @xmath25 is the distance from the center of the shell in units of @xmath26^{1 \\over 3}a_0\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the bohr radius of hydrogen .",
    "@xmath28 is related to the potential in the usual way @xmath29    eq .  [ tf ] is supplemented with the boundary conditions : @xmath30 , and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the shell radius in dimensionless units and differentiation is with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "additionally , @xmath28 itself is continuous over its domain , and @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is found by numerical integration of eq .",
    "[ tf ] subject to the above boundary conditions .",
    "the charge density @xmath36 and total electronic energy @xmath37 are subsequently obtained from @xmath35 , as @xmath38^{3 \\over 2 } \\label{n}\\ ] ] and @xmath39 \\label{e - en}\\ ] ] as was obtained by march .",
    "the radial electron density of 60 is given as an example in fig .",
    "[ rho - ne ] .",
    "the electronic energy @xmath40 is found for various values of the dimensionless cage radius @xmath32 in the cases of @xmath41 2 and 10 , corresponding to 60 and 60 respectively . as the boundary condition for @xmath28 at the shell explicitly depends on @xmath4",
    ", @xmath40 will not have simple `` atomic '' scaling with @xmath4 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "if we add to @xmath40 the electrostatic self - energy of the continuum shell , @xmath43 , it is found that this total energy @xmath44 does not have a minimum for finite @xmath32 , in accord with teller s no - binding theorem@xcite for molecules in tf theory .",
    "the continuum shell self - energy is too large and dominates @xmath40 .",
    "however , if the self - energy is evaluated as a sum over point ions distributed on the shell surface , an energy minimum at finite shell radius is found .",
    "the spherical approximation is abandoned for the purposes of calculating the potential energy for the nuclear configuration .",
    "the self - energy of the nuclear configuration may be written in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a dimensionless number , computed from the actual equilibrium coordinates of 60 .",
    "it was previously@xcite computed as @xmath47 .",
    "the total energies for 60 and 60 as a function of the shell radius are displayed in figs .",
    "[ e - he ] and [ e - ne ] .",
    "the resulting equilibrium radii , @xmath48 , are listed in table  [ radii ] , together with the total energies for the equilibrium configuration .",
    "previous results for 60 are provided for comparison .",
    "the expansion of the equilibrium cage radius with increasing @xmath4 is observed , in agreement with a previous restricted hartree - fock calculation@xcite .",
    "it should , however , be noted that @xmath46 is a result of the detailed atomic positions in 60 .",
    "certainly , distortions which do not preserve the relative positions of cage ions will give rise to changes in @xmath46 , and consequently , to changes in @xmath48 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the monotonic increase of @xmath48 with @xmath4 does not follow the `` atomic size '' scaling relation ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the shell equilibrium can be understood from electrostatic considerations . at equilibrium ,",
    "the centrifugal force on the shell resulting from self - interaction is balanced by the centripetal force exerted on the shell by the charge contained inside the shell .",
    "the total charge contained inside the shell at equilibrium is @xmath50 , and the total number of electrons inside the shell is @xmath51 .",
    "thus we see that endohedral fullerenes whose central atoms have higher @xmath4 require more electrons inside the shell to maintain equilibrium .",
    "while approximating the discrete cage ions by a uniform spherical shell is valid approximation with regard to the total energy , it is the corrections to the spherical average which contain all the information regarding the bonding .",
    "the spherical approximation reduces the complex to a one - dimensional system .",
    "the consequent critical points in the electron density consist of only minima and maxima , and an analysis of the bonding topology requires consideration of the effects of the nuclear multipole moments @xmath52 .",
    "a method for finding the electron density corrugations of endohedral fullerenes is given below .    to treat these non - spherical contributions",
    ", one must return to the general tf equation , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the ( positive ) nuclear charge density .",
    "@xmath55 can be expressed as a sum of spherical harmonics , @xmath56 where @xmath57    the potential @xmath58 is now written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the spherically  averaged solution and @xmath61 results from consideration of the higher order multipole moments .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath61 is much smaller than @xmath60 .",
    "thus , eq .  [ tf2 ] leads to a linearized equation for @xmath61 @xmath62    eq .",
    "[ zeta ] is of the form of the single particle schrdinger eq . at zero energy with a central `` potential , ''",
    "@xmath63 , which is everywhere positive , and an non - homogeneous boundary term .",
    "@xmath61 may be expanded in spherical harmonics inside and outside @xmath64 , and the boundary term gives rise to a discontinuity in the radial derivative of @xmath61 .",
    "thus , @xmath65 where @xmath66 satisfies the following @xmath67 and is subject to the following boundary conditions @xmath68    as the effective `` potential '' in eq .",
    "[ effse ] is positive for all @xmath69 , only exponential solutions are possible for @xmath61 . without a discontinuity in the radial derivative ,",
    "only the trivial solution would satisfy the boundary conditions at the origin and at infinity .",
    "thus , @xmath66 is non - zero only when @xmath6 is non - zero .",
    "the first non - spherical corrections to the potential and the electron density then are at @xmath70 , 10 . not surprisingly , these @xmath71 values correspond to irreducible representations of the rotation group which contain the trivial representation ( a@xmath72 ) of i@xmath73 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the centrifugal term in the effective `` potential '' will reduce the contributions from large @xmath71 to the density .",
    "the simplest bonding configuration consistent with the symmetry constraints is that of sixty bonds between the central atom and the carbon atoms in the cage .",
    "however , a second possibility was proposed on the basis of an ab - initio calculation@xcite on 60 . there , it was found that with the ne atom in the center of the cage , thirty bond paths exist , starting on the ne atom and terminating on the carbon - carbon double bond points .",
    "is this a stable configuration with respect to central atom displacement ?    while the total energy calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that ne is in a stable equilibrium at the center of the cage , unless the bond point at the carbon - carbon double bond is a non - nuclear attractor  @xcite ( `` pseudoatom '' ) , it would seem that the bonding topology found in ref .",
    "@xcite may correspond to that of the metastable state described by bader  @xcite as a `` conflict structure . ''",
    "given that the na@xmath74 is isoelectronic with ne , and that na@xmath74 in na@xmath74@60 does distort along a five - fold axis , a similiar instability in 60 would seem possible .",
    "the possible incompatibility of the molecular graph with the total energy calculations indicates that additional study is warranted , and central atom distortions in rare gas endohedral fullerenes remain as an intriguing possibility ."
