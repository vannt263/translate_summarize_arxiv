    "with the start of the lhc as a main source of motivation , jet physics has seen a tremendous development over the last couple of years .",
    "a significant amount of effort has been placed in trying to define jets in an optimal way for new physics searches . just to mention a few examples ,",
    "this includes the introduction of new jet algorithms @xcite , new techniques to clean the underlying event ( ue ) contribution to the jets @xcite , or a large series of sub - jet techniques aimed at tagging boosted objects @xcite .    an aspect that has been slightly less investigated is the values that one should use for the parameters inherent to a jet definition .",
    "a noticeable example is the case of the `` radius '' of a jet , often denoted by @xmath0 , common to all the standard jet definitions used in hadronic collisions .",
    "it has been noticed @xcite that if one wants to optimise the kinematic reconstruction of dijet events at the lhc , it is mandatory to adapt the radius of the jet when varying the scale of the process and the type of partons involved in the reconstruction .    with the appearance of new techniques ,",
    "new parameters are added and one might expect the corresponding multi - dimensional optimisation to become more and more involved .",
    "there is therefore a risk that a poor choice of parameters for the definition of jets counteracts the positive effect of these new refinements .    in this paper",
    "we thus want to take an alternative , complementary , approach and , instead of adding a new procedure with its own parameters , study how it is possible to fix one parameter in an optimal way given the properties of the events we want to reconstruct .",
    "in other words , we shall remove one free parameter by determining it analytically from the scales in the process we shall look at . practically , we shall focus on the determination of the most natural parameter , the radius @xmath0 , for the reconstruction of a massive colour - neutral object decaying into two jets , as done within a monte carlo approach in @xcite . in that case , we want to choose @xmath0 large enough to catch the perturbative qcd radiation , but not too large to avoid an excessive contamination from the ue .",
    "our approach thus goes along the same line as @xcite , except that we shall extend the discussion to include extra features requested by the fact that we are looking at a peaked distribution and wish to obtain a more precise determination of @xmath0 .",
    "contrarily to the case of @xcite , where an attempt was made to adapt dynamically the size of the jet with its hardness by replacing the size parameter with a dimensionful scale varying with the process under consideration , we shall determine a unique value for @xmath0 from the hard scale of the event and the scale of the ue , _ i.e._not introducing any alternative parameter .",
    "the paper is organised as follow : in section [ sec : process ] we describe the process we will study as well as the details on how we proceed with the event analysis .",
    "we also describe in that section our strategy for the analytic computation of the optimal radius @xmath1 .",
    "we then proceed with the computation of @xmath1itself .",
    "section [ sec : pqcd ] concentrates on the situation at the partonic level , where only perturbative radiation has to be taken into account ; while in section [ sec : ue ] we add to the picture the contamination due to the ue . in both cases , we shall compare our results with what we obtain from monte - carlo studies , as in @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : subtraction ] , we shall discuss the extraction of the optimal jet radius for situations where we perform an underlying event background subtraction .",
    "as in @xcite , we shall study the hard processes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where the ( fictitious ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 are made very narrow .",
    "the main advantage of such simple processes is that one can easily study the definition of jets at a given scale , by varying the mass @xmath6 of the colourless resonance .",
    "it also allows one to study the differences between quark and gluon jets , and to test the validity of our computations with monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the procedure for the event analysis is straightforward : we cluster the events with a given jet definition , select the two highest-@xmath7 jets and reconstruct the heavy object from them . in monte - carlo studies , the events were generated either with pythia @xcite ( tune dwt ) or with herwig and @xmath8 events , which does not make any difference in the discussions throughout this paper . ]",
    "@xcite with the default jimmy tune for the ue .",
    "we have required that the jets satisfy @xmath9 gev and @xmath10 , and we have further imposed that the two hardest jets , the ones used to reconstruct the heavy object , are close enough in rapidity , @xmath11 ( so that the transverse momentum of the jets remains close to @xmath12 ) .    the quantification of the performance of a given jet definition is also borrowed from @xcite : we define @xmath13 as the width of the smallest mass window that contains a fraction @xmath14 of the reconstructed objects was defined as a fraction of the generated objects rather than a fraction of the reconstructed ones . though the former is practically more reliable , choosing the later does not affect @xmath1 in practice and simplifies considerably the analytic computation . ] . with that definition , a smaller @xmath15 would correspond to a narrower peak and thus a better reconstruction quality . finding the optimal @xmath0 , @xmath1 ,",
    "is therefore equivalent to finding the minimum of @xmath15 , seen as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "our task in this paper is to perform an analytic computation of the spectrum of the reconstructed mass peak @xmath16 , or @xmath17 with @xmath18 , the difference between the reconstructed and the nominal mass . by integrating that spectrum",
    ", we can compute the probability @xmath19 for the difference @xmath20to be between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "if we write the quality measure as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the lower and upper end of the mass window defining @xmath15 , it is a straightforward exercise to show that it can be computed from the analytic spectrum by solving @xmath26 repeating this for different values of @xmath0 , one can then compute @xmath27 , the value of @xmath0 for which the quality measure is minimal .",
    "we shall use @xmath28 .",
    "as far as the analytic computation itself is concerned , there are three physical contributions that will affect the width of the reconstructed peak : final - state radiation , initial - state radiation and the ue .",
    "the first two are perturbative ; while final - state radiation leads to losses by emissions out of the jet , initial - state radiation adds extra , unwanted , radiation inside the jet . already at the purely partonic level , there is thus an optimal radius . at this stage ,",
    "the mass spectrum will depend on the mass of the reconstructed object , @xmath6 , and whether it decays into quarks or gluons since , perturbatively , gluons radiate more than quarks .    the third contamination , the underlying event , is softer .",
    "like the initial - state radiation , it tends to move the reconstructed mass towards larger values by clustering soft particles into the jet .",
    "the amount of contamination involves another scale : the density of ue ( per unit area ) @xmath29 .",
    "the most important source of dispersion in the mass spectrum comes from the fact that @xmath29 varies from an event to another .    in the next two sections , we first concentrate on the purely perturbative behaviour , then include the effect of the ue . but",
    "before getting our hands dirty , there is one additional point that needs to be discussed : the fact that we should also expect some effect due to hadronisation . actually , for the purposes of this paper , hadronisation plays a limited role . in theory",
    "@xcite , it leads to a loss that increases like @xmath30 at small @xmath0 , to be compared with a @xmath31 for the perturbative component , and so should dominate the small-@xmath0 behaviour .",
    "however , the normalisation is such that for practical values of @xmath0 the perturbative contribution dominates , and the effect of hadronisation on the value of @xmath1remains negligible .",
    "a final comment concerns the jet algorithm that we shall consider : we will mostly focus on the anti-@xmath32 algorithm @xcite as its behaviour is simpler . in section [ sec : full_algs ]",
    "we shall discuss the case of the cambridge / aachen @xcite and cambridge / aachen with filtering @xcite algorithms .",
    "the part of the spectrum that is the most naturally computed is the pure perturbative qcd contribution .",
    "this is equivalent to concentrating on partonic events . in that case",
    ", two types of contribution can affect the reconstruction of the jet momentum : final - state radiation outside of the jet which leads to an underestimation of the jet momentum , and in - jet initial - state radiation yielding an over - estimation of the momentum .    in this section",
    ", we shall thus compute the pure partonic spectrum .",
    "we do this at the one - gluon - emission ( oge ) level . since we are interested in the behaviour of the spectrum close to the mass peak , we are dominated by the @xmath33 singularity directly coming from the soft divergence of qcd . in that region , to get an integrable spectrum around the mass peak ,",
    "it is also important to resum the @xmath34 contributions to all orders , which we shall do assuming a sudakov - like exponentiation , neglecting non - global logarithms @xcite .",
    "for the clarity of the computation , we first deal with the soft approximation , where we only keep the @xmath33 part of the gluon emission .",
    "we then introduce the sub - leading corrections coming from the pdf in the initial state which can have non - negligible effects , especially in the case of gluon resonances at large mass .      because of longitudinal boost invariance",
    ", we can assume that the heavy object is produced at @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , because of our cut @xmath36 on the dijets , we shall assume that the decay products are at the same rapidity .",
    "the correction due to the finiteness of @xmath37 can be computed but has very little effect ( at most a few percent ) .",
    "since the calculation for a nonzero @xmath37 cut becomes rather technical , we shall keep things simple and assume @xmath38 . at the lowest order of perturbation theory , the incoming ( @xmath39 ) and outgoing ( @xmath40 ) partons",
    "thus have the following momenta @xmath41 we shall consider the emission of an extra soft gluon : @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "the probability for such an emission to happen is given by the antenna formula @xmath44 for an emission from the initial state , and a similar expression with @xmath45 replaced by @xmath46 for final - state radiation .",
    "the pre - factor @xmath47 is a colour factor which should be equal to @xmath48 for an emission from a quark line and @xmath49 for an emission from a gluon line .",
    "note that in the case of a single soft emission , the gluon is caught if and only if it is at a geometric distance smaller than @xmath0 from one of the two `` leading '' partons in the final state @xcite or cambridge / aachen , with or without filtering , as well as for the siscone @xcite algorithm ( at least in the @xmath43 limit ) . ] .",
    "if we denote by @xmath50 the difference , @xmath51 , between the reconstructed mass and the nominal one , initial - state radiation will lead to an overestimation of the jet mass with @xmath52 whenever the additional gluon is radiated inside the jet , while final - state radiation outside the jet will lead to an underestimation of the mass with @xmath53 .    integrating over the rapidity and azimuth of the emitted gluon and using ( [ eq : antenna ] ) , we find @xmath54 for the initial - state radiation spectrum , and @xmath55 for final - state radiation , with @xmath56 & & \\\\[-3 mm ] a_f(r ) & = & 2 \\pi \\log(2/r ) - \\frac{\\pi}{72 } r^4 + { \\cal o}(r^8)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] capturing the geometric factors and the @xmath0 dependence .",
    "one recognises the typical expected behaviour : the contamination due to initial - state radiation is proportional to the jet area , _",
    "i.e._to @xmath57 , while the logarithmic behaviour at small @xmath0 of the final - state radiation is the trace of the collinear divergence in qcd . in both cases",
    ", the @xmath58 behaviour corresponds to the soft divergence of qcd .",
    "note that the coefficient of the final - state radiation @xmath59 has been expanded in series of @xmath0 .",
    "the logarithmic behaviour at small @xmath0 corresponds to the leading collinear term as computed in @xcite but we have kept enough terms in the expansion to have a correct description over the whole @xmath0 range . in particular , the numerator in the argument of the logarithm will play a mandatory role to allow the best radius to go above 1 , which is the case in the purely perturbative spectrum and , more generally , for large - mass gluon resonances .",
    "it is also important to discuss the choice of scale @xmath60 for @xmath61 . when using equation ( [ eq : antenna ] ) , the argument of the coupling is , for initial and final - state radiation respectively , @xmath62 & & \\\\[-3 mm ] \\mu_f^2 & \\!=\\ ! & 2 \\frac{(k_1.k)(k_2.k)}{(k_1.k_2)}\\,=\\,\\frac{z^2m^2}{4}\\left[\\cosh^2(y)-\\cos^2(\\phi)\\right].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming that emissions close to the edge of the jet are dominant , we will use the following simplified approximation : @xmath63    as we are interested in the behaviour of the mass spectrum in the vicinity of the peak , the last thing we need to consider is the virtual corrections and the higher - order terms that diverge as @xmath64 in that region . in principle , this would depend on the jet algorithm under consideration and an exact computation would involve non - global logarithms @xcite . in practice , we shall adopt a simpler approach and assume that the one - gluon - emission result exponentiates .",
    "this is equivalent to the introduction of a sudakov factor @xmath65 where the integration is performed up to @xmath66 , corresponding to @xmath67 at @xmath35 .",
    "this is an arbitrary choice though a different one would only introduce corrections beyond the level of precision we are working at . using equations ( [ eq : pqcd_barespectrum_i ] ) , ( [ eq : pqcd_barespectrum_f ] ) , ( [ eq : couplingscales ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : sudakov ] ) we find @xmath68^{k_{i , f}-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath69    we note that as long as @xmath70 is smaller than 1 , the spectrum goes to 0 when @xmath50 tends to @xmath71 .",
    "alternatively , we could regularise the landau pole in the expression for @xmath61 but we have noticed no significant effect in our conclusions when doing so .    , governing the behaviour of the initial or final - state qcd spectrum as a function of @xmath0 for different masses .",
    "the left plot covers the case of quark jets for which we use @xmath72 , and the right plot is for gluon jets for which @xmath73 . ]    together with the spectrum , we will also need the total probability for the reconstructed mass to be within a certain range , _ i.e._the integrated spectrum .",
    "denoting by @xmath19 the probability for @xmath74 to be between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we easily find @xmath75^{k_{i , f}}\\ ] ] corresponding to the spectrum ( [ eq : spectrum_pqcd_rc ] ) .",
    "note that in this computation , we have assume that the spectrum is cut at the landau pole , corresponding to @xmath76 .    before proceeding with a more involved computation ,",
    "it is important to comment on the limit of validity of this perturbative computation . from equations ( [ eq : pqcd_barespectrum_i ] ) , ( [ eq : pqcd_barespectrum_f ] ) and ( [ eq : pqcd_geomcoefs ] ) , one might expect higher - order corrections to be important when @xmath77 becomes of order 1 . fixing the scale in the coupling to @xmath12 for the sake of the argument , we have plotted that quantity on fig .",
    "[ fig : coefs ] for various cases of interest . in the case of quark - jets , both @xmath78 and @xmath79 remain smaller than 1 .",
    "the case of gluon jets is more interesting ; we see that the coefficient for final - state radiation goes above one at small @xmath0 . in the case of a small - mass resonance",
    ", this can happen for values of @xmath0 as large as 0.5 . as a rule of thumb , we can thus say that , in the case of a small - mass resonance decaying to gluon jets , our perturbative computation would only be valid for @xmath80 .",
    "it is particularly interesting to relate that to the observation made in @xcite that in this precise case of small - mass resonances decaying into gluons , we observed a disappearance of the peak in the reconstructed mass spectrum for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "though this was happening at slightly smaller values of @xmath0 ( around @xmath81 ) , the present computation provides an explanation of this effect : when @xmath82 grows above 1 , the peak in the final - state radiation spectrum is no longer around @xmath83 and the mass peak disappears .",
    "we shall come back to this point later in section [ sec : full_mc ] .",
    "note also that , from fig . [",
    "fig : coefs ] , one can have a feeling of what the optimal radius will be for parton - level events .",
    "indeed , one can expect that , for @xmath84 , the spectrum will be nearly symmetric around the nominal mass ( _ i.e._around @xmath83 ) , that is @xmath85 . for both quarks and gluons and for all masses , this means that one should expect @xmath86 .",
    "we will see later on that this is indeed relatively close to what we shall obtain but that pdf effects , computed in the next section , induce some departure from that situation .      in order to get a better description of the variety of processes we consider over the whole kinematic range",
    ", we shall see that it is important to take into account the effect of the pdf on initial - state radiation .",
    "this addresses the fact that the emission of an initial - state gluon imposes to take the parton distribution functions at a larger momentum fraction @xmath87 .",
    "this should therefore introduce an additional suppression , more important at large mass and for gluon - jets than for quark jets .",
    "let us consider the production of a heavy particle at a fixed rapidity @xmath88 .",
    "the leading - order cross section is easily obtained : @xmath89 where the index @xmath90 represents the colour of the colliding partons , @xmath91 is the pdf implicitly taken at a scale @xmath6 , and @xmath92 is the centre - of - mass energy of the collision .",
    "this expression also comes with the kinematic constraint @xmath93 .",
    "we should now add to that process an extra parton emitted at a rapidity @xmath94 .",
    "for our purpose of computing the initial - state radiation contamination to a jet , we can safely make the simplifying assumption that the rapidity of the gluon is the same as the rapidity of the `` leading '' parton , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath95 . by doing so , we decouple the effects of the pdf from the effects of the jet clustering .",
    "the latter will be reinserted later on by multiplying our results by the geometric factor @xmath96 .",
    "we thus have @xmath97 in that expression , @xmath98 is the longitudinal fraction of @xmath99 carried by the parton entering the collision satisfying @xmath100 . if we rewrite it in terms of the longitudinal momentum of the emitted parton ( measured w.r.t .",

    "this is feasible analytically with the choice of pdf but it leads to a gauss hypergeometric function in @xmath115 for which the sudakov factor can not be computed analytically .",
    "we will therefore carry on with the computation at a fixed rapidity @xmath88 .",
    "taking into account the emissions from both partons entering the collisions , normalising to the @xmath116 cross - section and reinserting the geometric factor , one obtains @xmath117,\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and it is understood that the terms in the squared brackets are restricted to the appropriate phase space _ i.e._@xmath120 , respectively for each term .    in order to compute the sudakov form factor analytically , we shall make the approximation that the exponents @xmath113 are integers ( in practice , we shall use @xmath121 and @xmath122 for ( anti-)quark and gluon - jets respectively ) , and expand the small-@xmath87 power behaviour to first order in @xmath50 : @xmath123 using @xmath124 the fact that @xmath113 is an integer allows one to see as a polynomial in @xmath50 .",

    "we want to conclude this section by a comparison of the predictions we obtain for the optimal radius from our analytical studies and from monte - carlo approaches .",
    "when dealing with the analytic result , we shall use the initial and final - state results computed in the previous sections in the two different situations for which we have analytic results : the soft limit with a running - coupling approximation , eqs . and , and the `` full '' spectrum where we also include the pdf effects in the initial - state radiation , eq . .",
    "the total perturbative qcd spectrum is the convolution of the initial and final - state pieces which , in practice , will be carried numerically .",

    "[ fig : parton_hist ] for quark jets , @xmath136 gev and gluon jets , @xmath135 tev .",
    "generally speaking , the agreement between our analytic computation and herwig is good , even very good for the 100 gev quark - jet case .",
    "note that this agreement is always better in the region of the peak , where the soft - gluon emissions approximation we are working with is supposed to hold .",
    "similarly the small differences in the tail at small and large @xmath137 are beyond the scope of our approximation . in both the quark and gluon - jet cases , we see that the inclusion of pdf effects , reducing the initial - state radiation , significantly improves the description , especially in the case of large - mass gluon jets , where we are sensitive to fast - falling gluon distributions at large @xmath87 .    extracted from parton - level pythia ( green triangles ) and herwig ( cyan circles ) simulations .",
    "the left plot shows the case of a resonance decaying into @xmath134 jets while the right plot has gluon jets . ]",
    "next , we turn to the computation of the quality measure , presented in fig . [",
    "fig : parton_quality ] .",
    "after properly taking into account the pdf effects , our computation agrees in shape with the monte - carlo results . for the normalisation",
    ", we are closer to the herwig simulation in the case of quark jets , while we better agree with pythia simulations for gluon jets .",
    "since our analytic computation is identical in both cases , it it somehow hard to find an explanation for those differences .",

    "this is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : parton ] for quark jets ( left panel ) and gluon jets ( right panel ) .",
    "despite the apparent normalisation issue between pythia and herwig observed on fig .",
    "[ fig : parton_quality ] , the fact that they agree on the shape of the quality means that they yield very similar extracted optimal radii .",
    "if we turn to the analytic computation , we first see that in the soft approximation , the optimal radius is independent on the process under consideration with @xmath138 regardless of the mass or the parton type . in practice , this is due to the fact that the quality measure is a complicated function of @xmath139 involving _ e.g._their derivatives which are different at @xmath140 . ] .",
    "the reduction of the initial - state radiation due to the pdf effects has a sizeable effect on the extracted optimal radius in such a way that , at the end of the day , our analytic extraction of @xmath1 in the `` full '' model reproduces very well the monte - carlo simulations with an error @xmath141 0.1 .",
    "one of the most important effects when clustering jets at hadronic colliders is the presence of the underlying event ( ue ) coming from multiple interaction and beam remnants .",
    "this tends to produce a fairly uniform soft radiation of a few gev per unit area that contaminates the jets and affects their momentum reconstruction . in this section",
    ", we therefore study the effects of this ue on the mass spectrum we have computed from perturbative qcd in the previous section .",
    "if we work within the assumption that the ue is uniform in rapidity and azimuth , the average @xmath7 contamination to each jet will be @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the ( active ) area of the jet @xcite and @xmath29 the ue density per unit area .",
    "for a given event , this contamination is affected by two kinds of fluctuations : first , the fluctuations of the background itself which go like @xmath144 , with @xmath145 the background fluctuations per unit area .",
    "then , keeping in mind the possibility to discuss our results for different jet algorithms than the anti-@xmath32 algorithm , the active area of a jet is in general known to fluctuate , with an average value proportional to @xmath57 that increases with @xmath7 in a different way for each jet algorithm .    for a given background density @xmath29 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath146 the probability distribution for a jet @xmath147 to receive a contamination @xmath148 from the ue .",
    "for a jet of area @xmath149 , this distribution has an average of @xmath150 and a dispersion @xmath151 .",

    "note that only the curves corresponding to the model including the pdf effects are shown on figure [ fig : ue_quality ] for clarity reasons .",

    "we see once again that the inclusion of the pdf effects significantly improves the description of the optimal radius for gluon jets at large mass , as expected .",

    "the analytic computation goes exactly as in the case of the anti-@xmath32 algorithm .",
    "the only thing that will change in our approach is the inclusion of the area contribution in the ue distribution .",

    "we see that , in agreement with the monte carlo , the differences between anti-@xmath32 and cambridge / aachen are very small and thus our analytic approach reproduces the expected behaviour correctly . for the case of the c / a algorithm with filtering",
    ", we obtain a good description in the case of quark dijet systems but systematically underestimate the optimal radius , by about 0.1 - 0.2 , in the case of gluon jets .",
    "we believe that this is due to the fact that we should also introduce some dependence on the algorithm at the level of the perturbative spectrum . in our soft - gluon approximation all",
    "the algorithm will have the same initial and final - state radiation spectra .",
    "however , with a more complete treatment , _ e.g._including non - global logarithms as in @xcite , differences will start appearing .",
    "another effect comes from the combination of the initial and final - state radiation spectra : the simple convolution we have used is reasonable in the case of the anti-@xmath32 algorithm where the shape of the jet is not affected by the radiation , but more subtle phenomena will appear for more complex algorithms , especially in the filtered case where , in some geometric regions , the capture of isr gluons can be affected by internal gluon radiation in the jet .",
    "all these effects are beyond the reach of the present analysis .",
    "as expected from the previous discussion , discrepancies are more pronounced in the case of gluon jets at large mass , where perturbative radiation dominated the spectrum .",
    "our computation nevertheless gives reasonable results at the end of the day , given also that for gluon dijets at larger mass , the minimum in the quality measure is less pronounced than in other situations .",
    "finally , let us mention that the case of the @xmath32 algorithm @xcite is also very close to what we obtain for the anti-@xmath32 and c / a algorithm , hence well reproduced by our calculation .",
    "for the siscone algorithm , differences in the perturbative spectrum also appear when the radiated gluon is not soft , we therefore postpone that case for a further study .      to some extent , the present calculation can be seen as an extended version of what has been done in @xcite , where the authors compute the average @xmath7 shift of a jet due to final - state radiation , hadronisation and the ue .",
    "the approach we pursue in this paper is however much more complete in the sense that we obtain the full spectrum instead of just the average value . as a consequence",
    ", we can extract the width of the peak really as the dispersion in the spectrum , while in @xcite the width is approximated by @xmath184 _",
    "i.e._the total dispersion is approximated by the sum of each independent average squared .",

    "we have used @xmath189 , @xmath132 , @xmath131 mev and computed the qcd coupling at the scale @xmath190 . instead of using a fixed value for @xmath191 as in @xcite",
    ", we have used the fact that it is related to the average background density , @xmath162 , through ( see section [ sec : full ] ) @xmath192 and used the values extracted from the monte carlo event samples and already used in section [ sec : full ] for @xmath162 .    the extracted value of @xmath1is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : dms ] in the case of pythia simulations , for the anti-@xmath32 algorithm .",
    "the results are compared with the monte carlo results and with our complete analytic calculation .",
    "we see that the simpler approach of @xcite manages to extract the correct value for @xmath1at small mass but fails to reproduce the observed behaviour at larger mass , and this for both quark and gluon jets .",
    "the reason for this failure is rather hard to pinpoint : it can come , _",
    "e.g. _ , from the crudeness of the approximation ( [ eq : dmsdisp ] ) , the lack of an initial - state radiation contribution and the corresponding pdf effects , or the description of the underlying event in terms of the average density @xmath162 instead of its fluctuations @xmath163 .",
    "the last point we wish to discuss is the situation where we perform background subtraction using jet areas @xcite , as advocated in @xcite .",
    "the idea behind ue subtraction is to get rid of the shift due to the ue density contaminating the mass reconstruction .",
    "since subtraction is performed on each single event , one hopes to get rid of the fluctuations of the background density across the events , hence obtaining a narrower peak . in this respect , all we should be left with is the background fluctuations inside an event which have a linear dependence on @xmath0 rather than the quadratic one computed in the unsubtracted case .",
    "this is a much smaller effect and one thus expect the quality measure to be better ( _ i.e._smaller ) than in the unsubtracted case as well as the optimal radius to be larger .    in practice",
    ", one would thus naively convolute the perturbative spectrum computed in section [ sec : pqcd ] with a subtracted ue spectrum taking into account these intra - event fluctuations . doing that would actually lead to a quality much better than what is observed in monte - carlo studies and to a systematic over - estimation of @xmath1 .    the additional effect that is mandatory to take into account is the fact that subtraction is performed using an estimated value for the background density @xmath193 which can differ from the exact value of @xmath29 for that event .",
    "this results in some smearing effect left over from the unsubtracted spectrum . because of this , the computation of the subtracted ue spectrum turns out to be more involved than the corresponding unsubtracted case computed in section [ sec : full ] , mostly because one also would have to consider the distribution probability for @xmath193 .",
    "the properties of the estimated value of @xmath29 have actually recently been discussed at length in @xcite , where we learn that the estimation of the background density using a median - based approach suffers from two sources of bias : one of soft origin , related to the fact that the median of a set of pure - ue jets may differ from its average ; and a contamination from radiation coming from the hard jets .",
    "if we call @xmath29 and @xmath145 the average ue density and its fluctuations for one given event , and define @xmath194 as the relative error in the estimation of @xmath29 , the average and dispersion of @xmath195 are @xcite @xmath196 where , as in section [ sec : full ] we used @xmath197 , and the coefficients are @xmath198 and @xmath199 with @xmath200 in the previous set of equations , @xmath201 is a pure number extracted in @xcite , @xmath202 is the jet radius used to estimate the background properties , @xmath203 is the total area of the range we are using to estimate the background , @xmath181 is a soft cut - off that we fixed to 1 gev , and @xmath204 is the hard scale that we naturally took equal to @xmath12 .",
    "these properties constrain the distribution of @xmath195 , that we shall denote by @xmath205 , as a function of @xmath60 .",
    "since the intra - event fluctuations will play a substantial role in this ue - subtracted situation , we shall also consider a distribution for them .",
    "for simplicity , we shall parametrise the distribution in terms of @xmath60 rather than in terms of @xmath145 as background estimations are naturally expressed in that variable .",
    "we therefore introduce @xmath206 , of average @xmath207 and dispersion @xmath208 . in the course of the computation",

    "we have kept all the jets within one unit of rapidity around the hardest dijet , excluding the two hardest jets in the event , giving a total area @xmath227 .",

    "we have mostly considered the case of the anti-@xmath32 algorithm but have also considered other options .    generally speaking , we can say that we obtain a good description of the monte - carlo results , especially when including the pdf effects in initial - state radiation .",
    "the optimal radius @xmath1computed analytically is in most cases less than 0.1 away from the monte - carlo expectation .",
    "the comparison at a more basic level , the quality measure or even the mass spectrum , also shows a good agreement .",
    "most of the deviations between our analytic results and monte carlo simulations can probably be traced back to what we observe at the partonic level .",
    "though our analytic computation reproduces nicely the monte - carlo simulations , we have observed some deviations in section [ sec : pqcd_mc ] .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the differences between our description and the monte - carlo results is usually of the same order as the differences obtained between pythia and herwig .",
    "these differences propagate to the situation where the ue is included .",
    "the one case where our analytic results deviate a bit more from the monte - carlo simulations is the case of the cambridge / aachen algorithm supplemented by a filter ( see section [ sec : full_algs ] ) , for events including the ue , while our description remains good for the anti-@xmath32 and the cambridge / aachen algorithm without any filter .",
    "we think that a better description goes beyond the reach of the present analysis , _",
    "e.g._already at the partonic level , a simple convolution between the initial and final - state spectra may be too simplistic when filtering is applied .",
    "let us also notice that our description of the ue allows us to treat successfully both the case where the ue is subtracted and the case where it is not .",
    "our approach includes all the effects that contribute to the dispersion of the reconstructed mass : mostly background fluctuations from one event to another , intra - event fluctuations and area fluctuations .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the case of subtracted ue , it was also mandatory to take into account the fact that the estimated background can differ from its `` true '' value .",
    "this leads to a significant additional contribution to the dispersion . using the analytic computations from @xcite",
    "led to good results for the extracted @xmath1 .",
    "if one wishes to improve the present description , additional effects have to be included in the analytic computation : relaxing the soft - gluon - emission approximation , obtaining sub - leading logarithmic corrections , performing a better resummation of the soft virtual corrections than a simple sudakov factor , _ e.g._using non - global logarithms , and including hadronisation corrections .",
    "however , we have seen that the description we can achieve with our simple approach is already satisfactory without having to introduce these corrections .",
    "it is nevertheless important to remember their existence as they might become relevant in more specific situations , like the case of filtering where we have observed that we start to reach the limits of our simple approach .",
    "some effects , like subleading logarithmic corrections , may even be simpler to compute analytically than to implement in a monte carlo .",
    "another point that we have not investigated and that might be interesting in a future study is the case of the rapidity dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "as we have seen in section [ sec : pdf ] , pdf effects introduce a dependence on the rapidity at which the heavy object is produced @xcite and it might be interesting to see how @xmath1varies with that rapidity .    also , all the computations we have performed were for a complete event - set .",
    "a next major step would be to optimise the radius on an event - by - event basis .",
    "this is much more complicated as the previous approach would then only give access to an average dispersion for a single event and the additional dispersion arising when combining the whole set of events would be much harder to handle .",
    "we therefore also leave that step to future studies .",
    "the question of knowing which jet algorithm should be preferred has already triggered many discussions both on the theoretical and on the experimental side , and more complex jet definitions introducing more parameters have often been proposed to improve jet reconstruction .",
    "the present work , together with @xcite , can be seen as opening a new direction of improvement : analytically optimising the parameters in the jet definitions . considering a single parameter ,",
    "the jet radius , for a simple process , dijet reconstructions , is a first step in that direction . gaining analytic control on the parameters entering jet definitions",
    "can be extremely valuable .",

    "<S> obtaining a good momentum reconstruction of a jet is a compromise between taking it large enough to catch the perturbative final - state radiation and small enough to avoid too much contamination from the underlying event and initial - state radiation . in this paper , we compute analytically the optimal jet radius for dijet reconstructions and study its scale dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our results with previous monte - carlo studies . </S>"
