    "we consider the @xmath42 matrix form of @xmath43 by choosing arbitrary orientations for @xmath34-simplices and @xmath6-simplices in @xmath44 .",

    "a maximal acyclic set of @xmath6-faces is called a _",
    "@xmath6-hypertree _ , and an acyclic set of size @xmath64 is called an _ almost - hypertree_. hypertrees over @xmath11 were studied e.g. , by kalai  @xcite and others  @xcite in the search for high - dimensional analogs of cayley s formula for the number of labeled trees .",
    "a _ @xmath6-dimensional hypercut _ ( or _ @xmath6-hypercut _ in short ) is an inclusion - minimal set of @xmath6-faces that intersects every hypertree .",

    "shadowless_. for instance , a set of edges in a graph is closed if it is a disjoint union of cliques .",
    "we turn to define @xmath6-_collapsibility_. a @xmath34-face @xmath72 in a @xmath6-complex @xmath73 is called _ exposed _ if it is contained in exactly one @xmath6-face @xmath36 of @xmath73 .",
    "an elementary @xmath6-collapse on @xmath72 consists of the removal of @xmath72 and @xmath36 from @xmath73 .",

    "it is an easy observation that the set of @xmath6-faces in a @xmath6-collapsible @xmath6-complex is acyclic over every field .",
    "we refer the reader to section  [ section : combin ] for some more background material .",
    "* results : *    in this paper we study extremal problems concerning the possible sizes of hypercuts and shadows in simplicial complexes .",
    "we begin with some trivial observations on @xmath1-vertex graphs , starting with the ( non - tight ) claim that no cut can have more than @xmath74 edges .",
    "this follows , since for every cut there is a tree that meets it in exactly one edge .",
    "actually the largest number of edges of a cut is @xmath75 .",
    "we investigate here the @xmath10-dimensional situation and discover that it is completely different from the graphical case .",
    "when we discuss @xmath10-complexes , we refer to @xmath10-faces as faces ( and keep the terms vertex and edge for @xmath76 and @xmath16 dimensional faces ) .",
    "a @xmath10-dimensional hypertree has @xmath77 faces .",
    "so , by the same reasoning , every hypercut has at most @xmath78 faces .",
    "a hypercut of this size ( if one exists ) is called _",
    "perfect_. we show that @xmath11-perfect hypercuts exist for certain integers @xmath1 , and if a well - known conjecture by artin in number theory is true , there are _ infinitely many _ such @xmath1 .",
    "the construction is based on the @xmath10-complex of length-@xmath79 arithmetic progressions in @xmath18 , and is of an independent interest .    over the field",
    "@xmath12 , surprisingly , the situation changes .",
    "there are no perfect hypercuts for @xmath80 , and the largest possible hypercut has @xmath81 faces .",
    "we completely describe all the extremal hypercuts .    staying with @xmath82 and with @xmath83",
    "the situation depends on the _ parity _ of @xmath6 . as we show , for @xmath6 even the largest @xmath6-hypercuts have @xmath84 @xmath6-faces .",
    "when @xmath6 is odd , all @xmath6-hypercuts have density that is bounded away from 1 .",
    "equivalently , this subject can be viewed from the perspective of shadows of acyclic complexes .",
    "thus the complement of a perfect @xmath10-hypercut over @xmath11 is an almost - hypertree ( i.e. acylic complex with @xmath85 @xmath10-faces ) with an empty shadow .",
    "our results over @xmath12 can be restated as saying that the least possible size of the shadow of a @xmath10-dimensional @xmath12-almost - hypertree is @xmath86 .",
    "many questions suggest themselves : let @xmath20 be an @xmath41-acyclic @xmath6-dimensional @xmath1-vertex simplicial complex with a full skeleton and a given size .",
    "what is the smallest possible shadow of such @xmath20 ?",
    "more specifically , what is the largest possible size of @xmath20 if it is shadowless ?",
    "one construction that we present here applies to all fields at once , since it is based on the combinatorial notion of collapsibility .",
    "this is a collapsible @xmath10-complex with @xmath87 @xmath10-faces which remains collapsible after the addition of any other @xmath10-face .",
    "this yields , for every field @xmath41 , a shadowless @xmath41-acyclic @xmath10-complex with @xmath88 @xmath10-faces    we note that bjrner and kalai s work @xcite determines the _ largest _ possible shadow of an acyclic @xmath6-complex with @xmath88 faces .",
    "the extremal examples are maximal acyclic subcomplexes of a shifted complex with @xmath88 faces .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as following . in section  [ section : combin ]",
    "we introduce some additional notions in the combinatorics of simplicial complexes .",
    "section  [ sec : q ] deals with the problem of largest @xmath10-hypercuts over @xmath11 . in section  [ sec : f2 ] we study the same problem over @xmath12 . in section  [ sec : f2_even_dim ] we construct large @xmath6-hypercuts over @xmath12 for even @xmath89 . in section",
    "[ sec : cl_ac ] we deal with large acyclic shadowless @xmath10-dimensional sets .",
    "lastly , in section  [ section : open ] we present some of the many open questions in this area .",
    "recall that we view the @xmath6-boundary operator as a linear map over @xmath41 , that maps vectors supported on oriented @xmath6-simplices to vectors supported on @xmath34-simplices , given explicitly by the matrix @xmath43 , as defined in the introduction .",
    "the right kernel of @xmath43 is the linear space of _ @xmath6-cycles_. the left image of @xmath43 is the linear space @xmath90 of @xmath6-coboundaries of @xmath20 . with some abuse of notation",
    "we occasionally call a set of @xmath6-simplices a cycle or a coboundary if it is the _ support _ of a cycle or a coboundary .",
    "clearly over @xmath12 , this makes no difference . in this case",
    "each @xmath6-coboundary is associated with a set @xmath91 of @xmath34-faces , and consists of those @xmath6-faces whose boundary has an odd intersection with @xmath91 .    a @xmath6-coboundary is called _ simple _ if its support does not properly contain the support of any other non - empty @xmath6-coboundary .",
    "as observed e.g. , in @xcite , a coboundary is simple if and only if its support is a hypercut .",
    "if @xmath36 is a face in a complex @xmath20 , we define its _ link _ via @xmath92 .",
    "this is clearly a simplicial complex .",
    "for instance , the link of a vertex @xmath93 in a graph @xmath94 is @xmath93 s neighbour set which we also denote by @xmath95 or @xmath96 . for a @xmath10-coboundary @xmath65 over @xmath12 and a vertex @xmath97 $ ] , it is easy to see that the graph @xmath98 generates @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath99 . namely , the characteristic vector of the @xmath10-faces of @xmath65 equals to the vector - matrix left product of the characteristic vector of the edges of @xmath98 with the boundary matrix @xmath100 .",
    "we recall a necessary and sufficient condition that @xmath101 generates a @xmath10-hypercut @xmath65 rather than a general coboundary .",
    "two incident edges @xmath102,@xmath103 in a graph @xmath104 are said to be @xmath105-_adjacent _ if @xmath106 .",
    "we say that @xmath94 is @xmath105-_connected _ if the transitive closure of the @xmath105-adjacency relation has exactly one class .",
    "[ prop:2cut]@xcite a @xmath10-dimensional coboundary @xmath107 is a hypercut if and only if the graph @xmath108 is @xmath105-connected for every @xmath93 .",
    "the main result of this section is a construction of @xmath10-dimensional _ shadowless _ @xmath11-almost - hypertrees . as mentioned above",
    ", the complement of such a complex is a _",
    "hypercut having @xmath109 faces which is the most possible .",
    "[ thm : noshadow ] let @xmath110 be a prime for which @xmath111 is generated by @xmath112 .",

    "then ,    * @xmath115 is @xmath10-collapsible , and hence it is an almost - hypertree over every field . * @xmath116 over @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , the complement of @xmath115 is a perfect hypercut over @xmath11 .    the entire construction and much of the discussion of @xmath115",
    "is carried out over @xmath18 .",
    "however , in the following discussion , the boundary operator @xmath50 of @xmath115 is considered over the rationals .",
    "we start with two simple observations .",
    "first , note that @xmath115 has a full @xmath16-skeleton , i.e. , every edge is contained in some @xmath10-face of @xmath20 .",
    "also , we note that the choice of omitting the arithmetic triples with difference @xmath117 is completely arbitrary . for every @xmath118 , the automorphism @xmath119 of @xmath18 maps @xmath115 to a combinatorially isomorphic complex of arithmetic triples over @xmath18 , with omitted difference @xmath120 .",
    "consequently , theorem  [ thm : noshadow ] holds equivalently for any difference that we omit . in what follows",
    "we indeed assume for convenience that the missing difference is not @xmath117 , but rather @xmath121 .    for @xmath122 ,",
    "define @xmath123 where all additions are @xmath124 .",
    "this is an ordered subset of directed edges in @xmath115 .",
    "similarly , we consider the collection of arithmetic triples of difference @xmath6 , @xmath125    clearly every directed edge appears in exactly one @xmath126 and then its reversal is in @xmath127 . likewise for arithmetic triples and the @xmath128 s .",
    "since we assume that @xmath129 is generated by @xmath130 , it follows that the powers @xmath131 , @xmath132 , are all distinct , and , moreover , no power is an additive inverse of the other .",
    "therefore , the sets @xmath133 , @xmath134 , constitute a partition of the @xmath16-faces of @xmath115 .",

    "lemma  [ lem : boundaryofarithcomplex ] implies that the edges in @xmath161 are exposed .",
    "collapsing on these edges leads to elimination of @xmath161 and the faces in @xmath162 . in terms of the matrix @xmath50",
    ", this corresponds to removing the rightmost `` supercolumn '' .",
    "now the edges in @xmath163 become exposed , and collapsing them leads to elimination of @xmath163 , and @xmath164 .",
    "this results in exposure of @xmath165 , etc . repeating the argument to the end ,",
    "all the faces of @xmath115 get eliminated , as claimed .    to show that @xmath115 is an almost - hypertree we need to show that the number of its @xmath10-faces is @xmath166 .",
