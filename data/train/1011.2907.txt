    "the nature of the dark matter ( dm ) remains a mystery . for dm in the mev to tev range ,",
    "a wide variety of probes constrain the dm to be a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) which interacts with ordinary matter through suppressed couplings .",
    "these probes include direct detection of dm through nuclear recoils in underground detectors as well as indirect detection through dm annihilation to sm states in the sun ( to neutrinos ) , in the galactic center ( to photons ) , and in the galactic neighborhood ( to charged particles ) .",
    "there are also significant constraints on dm couplings to ordinary matter through production and escape as missing energy at colliders . for a review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "many of the most popular dm candidates naturally meet these stringent requirements .",
    "the neutralino from supersymmetry , for example , carries no electric charge and can interact only sub - weakly , via the higgs or through small couplings to the @xmath5 boson , evading the most stringent constraints from lep , tevatron , and direct detection experiments such as cdms @xcite and xenon10 @xcite .",
    "its thermal annihilation cross - section is below the bounds for indirect detection through neutrinos , photons , or charged cosmic rays .",
    "while wimp dm has escaped direct and indirect detection thus far , it may be within reach .",
    "direct detection experiments are scaling up , the reach of the lhc will begin to encompass weak scale dm candidates soon , and fermi will continue to constrain dm annihilation in dwarf galaxies , the galactic center , and in the halo .    at the same time , it is desirable to take as model - independent an approach as possible when constraining the nature of the dm .",
    "while in most popular models the dm carries no electromagnetic charge , periodically the notion of charged massive particle ( a champ ) has reappeared in the literature @xcite . in some of the earliest discussions of champs , the dm carried a full unit of charge , but it was realized that this runs into a wide range of very stringent constraints from searches for heavy hydrogen to direct detection in underground labs .",
    "some of these constraints may not apply if the champs are expelled from the disk via shock waves from supernova remnants and screened from re - entry by the galactic magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "more recently , the possibility that dm carries a fractional or epsilon - charge has been considered and constrained via the cmb acoustic peaks @xcite .",
    "radio observations also constrain the electronic charge of the dark matter  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the notion that the dm carries a `` dark charge '' has recently been considered @xcite . in these latter models",
    "the dm does not couple to the photon , but to a massless gauge force in the hidden sector .    in light of the current understanding of structure formation and cosmological history , we determine how large the dm charge can be while remaining consistent with current constraints .",
    "we also consider direct detection signals from epsilon - charged dm , and determine whether it is possible to give rise to the signals in dama @xcite and cogent @xcite as discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "because we are answering a general question about the coupling of dm to the photon , we leave our discussion of models to a minimum .",
    "we note that the discussion encompassed by this paper does bring to light a number of constraints that strongly disfavor some recent models in the literature .",
    "we comment on these models below where relevant .",
    "dm may also have a magnetic or electric dipole ; this has been thoroughly considered recently @xcite , and we do not discuss it here .    the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion of models and the implications of this study for the viability of these models .",
    "we then review the relic density calculation before turning to constraints .",
    "we discuss halo shape constraints and the bound from scattering at recombination times .",
    "we discuss direct detection of charged particles in light of the signals from cogent and dama , and the implications of the bounds discussed here for these experiments and models designed to fit them .",
    "finally , we conclude .",
    "since dm that carries an electric charge must conserve @xmath6 , it must be a dirac particle .",
    "there are a number of models in the literature where the dm carries a fractional or epsilon - charge .",
    "if a dark photon is massive and kinetically mixes with the photon , an epsilon - charge arises in stueckelberg models @xcite on account of the unique form of stueckelberg mass term .",
    "if , on the other hand , the dark photon is massless , kinetic mixing between the dark and visible photons induces an electric charge for the dm ( or equivalently , a dark charge for visible states ) @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is utilized for example in the mirror charged dm model proposed by @xcite to generate the signals in cogent and dama .",
    "we will see that the constraints we discuss here strongly disfavor such a model as the explanation for these signals . in either case , we denote the charge of the dm as @xmath7 .",
    "when determining the constraints on the dm charge , the essential features will be the irreducible coupling to the photon ( and charged sm particles ) , and , more importantly , the velocity dependence of the scattering cross - section .",
    "for example , the rutherford scattering cross - section of dm off dm through a photon is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dm mass , @xmath10 is the dm relative velocity , and @xmath11 is the scattering angle in the center - of - mass frame . likewise , the scattering cross - section of dm off baryon is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dm - baryon reduced mass .",
    "the important point phenomenologically is the very large enhancement in the scattering cross - section at low velocity , giving a hint for where to look for strong constraints on dm charge .",
    "galactic constraints , where the dm has been heated through collapse and virialization , as we will see , tend to give weak constraints .",
    "in contrast , the tightest constraints come primordially , before collapse and heating occur , when the dm is highly non - relativisitic .",
    "in particular we will find that constraints on dm coupled to baryons at the time of recombination and dm coupled to baryons in protohalos can be very important , and this constraint will eliminate models whose charges are larger than about @xmath1 , dependent on the mass of the dm .",
    "this constraint eliminates a broad class of models .    on the other hand , this constraint does not eliminate dm with epsilon - charges that can give rise to a signal in direct detection experiments .",
    "we will find , however , that in the region where the dm could give rise to a signal in direct detection , one expects the dm to have been evacuated from the disk via supernova shock waves , and its re - entry to have been prevented by galactic magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , although direct detection experiments are extremely sensitive to small charges , we will find that charged dm , such as suggested in @xcite , could not plausibly give rise to a signal in a direct detection experiment .",
    "we now go through these constraints in detail .",
    "we begin by discussing the constraints from the relic density .",
    "if the dm is non - thermally produced , its relic density depends on the production mechanism ( for example , if the dm particle is produced via the decay of a mother particle , its relic density depends on the number density of the mother particle ) . in this scenario ,",
    "constraints from the current relic abundance are highly model dependent . on the other hand , in the case of thermal relics ,",
    "the dm density is simply determined by the thermally averaged annihilation cross section . as we will discuss explicitly , a charged dm consistent with all cosmological constraints",
    "must be non - thermally produced , unless it has additional interactions .",
    "we now review the relic density considerations .",
    "the dm can annihilate to photon pairs and to charged fermion pairs through the photon . in general , the charged dm can also carry other sm or hidden sector quantum numbers and annihilate through these channels as well . in our analysis",
    "we will not specify these additional interactions in detail ; instead , we maintain a less model - dependent view .",
    "we assume dm is in thermal equilibrium in the early universe and require the irreducible annihilation processes not overly deplete dm . by considering only the annihilation channels induced by the electromagnetic charge of the dm",
    ", we can derive upper bounds on the charge @xmath0 for a given mass @xmath14 .",
    "the annihilation cross sections of @xmath15 and @xmath16 at tree level are given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , where @xmath19 is the charge of the sm fermion in units of electron charge and @xmath20 is the color multiplicity of the fermion .",
    "the total annihilation cross section of the dm particle at tree level is @xmath21 .",
    "the tree level annihilation cross section is enhanced by the sommerfeld effect in the low velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "dm freeze out with sommerfeld enhancement has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "since the mediator of the sommerfeld enhancement is the standard model photon with zero mass , this enhancement never saturates .",
    "the enhancement factor for the tree level s - wave annihilation cross section is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dm velocity in the center of mass frame .",
    "the thermally averaged total annihilation cross section including the sommerfeld enhancement is given by @xmath24 where we assume a maxwell - boltzmann distribution for dm particle and @xmath25 with @xmath26 as the dm temperature .",
    "the sommerfeld enhanced annihilation tends to deplete dm particles with low velocity , which may distort the thermal distribution of the dm after kinetic decoupling .",
    "however , as we will show in the next section , the charged dm can couple to the thermal bath even during the recombination epoch , and therefore the maxwell - boltzmann distribution is a good approximation .    following the standard procedure to calculate the abundance of a thermal relic  @xcite ,",
    "freeze out occurs when @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the temperature of the thermal bath , and @xmath30 is the number of degrees of freedom of the dm particle ; we take @xmath31 , for a dirac particle .",
    "the value of @xmath32 is chosen to match the numerical solution ; we set @xmath33 .",
    "the present number density of the dm is the solution of the boltzmann equation , which can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 the entropy density , and @xmath37 with @xmath38 , where we stop the integration .",
    "here we assume @xmath39 and @xmath40 have the same number density , @xmath41 , and the total number density of the dm is their sum , @xmath42+@xmath43 .",
    "before kinetic decoupling , the dm temperature is the same as the thermal bath temperature and drops as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the scale factor .",
    "after kinetic decoupling , the dm temperature drops as @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the enhancement factor scales as @xmath47 and @xmath48 with respect to @xmath49 before and after kinetic decoupling , respectively  @xcite .",
    "since dm is tightly coupled to baryons through the massless photon until after the recombination epoch , @xmath47 over the entire range of integration of eq .  . as we will show in section iv , the elastic scattering rate rises as the temperature drops so that the dm may still be coupled to the thermal bath when the temperature is below @xmath50 , even if @xmath0 is chosen to satisfy the relic density bound",
    "charged dm particles interact with the standard model via a small coupling through the photon , so that coulomb scattering can couple the charged dm to the baryon - photon plasma tightly even at low temperature .",
    "if the dm is still in kinetic equilibrium with the baryon - photon plasma during recombination , the dm density fluctuations can be washed out due to the radiation pressure and the photon diffusion ( silk damping  @xcite ) .",
    "the baryon acoustic peak structure will also be directly altered through the coupling .",
    "the effects of millicharged particles on cmb acoustic peaks have been discussed in refs .",
    "it was found that if the millicharged particles couple to the baryon - photon plasma tightly during the recombination epoch they behave like baryons , and cmb observations put an upper limit on their abundance @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "here we assume that the dm is made of epsilon - charged particles and derive the relaxation time scale for the dm to reach kinetic equilibrium with baryons . to avoid damping effects on dm density fluctuations and cmb anisotropy constraints",
    ", we require that dm have _ completely _ decoupled from the photon - baryon plasma at the recombination epoch , and derive a bound on @xmath0 for a given dm mass .",
    "we consider a dm particle that has momentum @xmath52 in its comoving frame .",
    "after each scattering event the magnitude of the dm momentum changes by an amount @xmath53 .",
    "the momentum transfer rate is thus given by @xmath54 the thermally averaged momentum transfer per unit time is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is given by eq .",
    ", @xmath57 is the number density of the baryon , and @xmath58 is the momentum transfer after one collision : @xmath59 note that this quantity is reference frame independent .",
    "the thermally averaged momentum squared of the dm particle in its comoving frame is @xmath60 for a dm particle in a thermal maxwell distribution . to evaluate the thermal average for @xmath61",
    ", we derive a general formula . for a given function of @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 where we assume @xmath64 are maxwellian distributions and @xmath65 are the most probable velocities for the @xmath45 and @xmath66 particles , respectively . by using this general formula ,",
    "we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the cutoff in the @xmath69 integral . its value is set by the maximum impact parameter due to debye screening effects in the plasma .",
    "this maximum impact parameter is related to the minimum scattering angle through @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 for small @xmath68 .",
    "the impact parameter of the scattering must not be larger than the debye screening length , so we have @xmath73 .",

    ", we then have a momentum transfer rate of : @xmath76.\\ ] ] if the dm is tightly coupled to the baryon - photon plasma during recombination , dm density fluctuations will be damped .",
    "cmb observations also place strong constraints on the total abundance of charged particles in the tightly - coupled regime . here",
    "we require that the relaxation time of the momentum transfer rate is larger than the hubble time at the recombination epoch ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath77 where @xmath78  @xcite , and @xmath79 is the temperature at the recombination epoch .",
    "we take the baryon number density at recombination @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "this constraint is plotted in figure [ master ] . in the above analysis",
    ", we have implicitly assumed that photons couple to baryons efficiently during the recombination epoch despite the presence of charged dm .",
    "we checked that electron - photon compton scattering can keep baryons and dm particles in the kinetic equilibrium with photons .",
    "this is because the dm density is not far from the baryon density .",
    "the same compton drag force also suppresses the growth of the dm density perturbations .",
    "here we ignore the process of dm - photon compton scattering .",
    "since the cross section @xmath84 is proportional to @xmath85 and the momentum transfer rate through this process is also highly suppressed kinematically at low temperature , we expect that the bound derived from the dm - photon decoupling is weak . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , cmb anisotropies and matter power spectrum requires @xmath86 .",
    "we can translate this limit to a bound on @xmath0 as @xmath87 , which is much weaker than the bound derived from the dm - baryon decoupling .",
    "after recombination , radiation damping suppression is absent , but the efficient energy transfer between baryons and charged dm particles will modify the virialization process of the dm .",
    "since baryons decouple from the thermal bath much later than dm particles , baryons are hotter than dm particles at redshift @xmath88 when protohalos start to form .",
    "if there is a tight coupling between dm particles and baryons at this epoch , baryons will transfer energy to dm particles and heat them up .",
    "we can derive a bound on @xmath0 by requiring the energy transfer time be longer than the dm virialization time .",
    "eq .   is no longer valid for charged particles with slow motion in a neutral medium . at these late epochs ,",
    "although it appears that the born approximation condition @xmath89 may still be satisfied due to the smallness of @xmath0 , the charged dm particle typically has a wavelength larger than the bohr radius of the hydrogen atom , and one must take into account the screening effect .",
    "this effect is analogous to the energy loss of a slow - moving ion in the neutral medium , a result first derived by lindhard and scharff  @xcite .",
    "lindhard s approximation is valid when the impact parameter is larger than the bohr radius .",
    "when the protohalo forms at redshifts @xmath90 , the dm velocity dispersion is @xmath91 .",
    "its de broglie wavelength is much larger than the bohr radius under these conditions , and we expect that lindhard s formula applies .",
    "we calculate the energy exchange of the charged dm in the hydrogen medium using lindhard s formula , @xmath92,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the hydrogen number density , and we ignore the negligible effects of electron recoil  @xcite and other elements .",

    "the density is about @xmath98 times larger than the average density at the same epoch  @xcite , and the violent relaxation time scale is @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "now we demand @xmath102 and obtain an upper bound on @xmath0 , @xmath103 which is shown in fig",
    "the strongest constraints on the coupling of dm to the photon come from scattering considerations rather than annihilations because of the large scattering cross - section enhancement at low velocities . in the previous section",
    ", we explored the effects at high redshift from observations of universe at recombination temperatures .",
    "the constraints are particularly strong in this regime .",
    "however , lower redshift observations can also be used to test the charged dm hypothesis .      if the dm self - interaction through coulomb scattering is strong enough to create an @xmath104 change in the momentum of dm particles within the age of galaxies , it will isotropize the velocity dispersion and lead to more spherical halos",
    ". the collisions also cause heat conduction from the hot outer parts to the cooler inner parts of dm halos , giving rise to the formation of a core with a shallow density profile .",
