    "in this paper we give a multifractal analysis for stern  brocot intervals , continued fractions and certain diophantine growth rates .",
    "we apply and extend the multifractal formalism for average growth rates of @xcite to obtain a complete multifractal description of two dynamical systems originating from the set of real numbers .",
    "recall that the process of writing an element @xmath0 of the unit interval in its regular continued fraction expansion @xmath1=\\cfrac{1}{a_{1}(x)+\\cfrac{1}{a_{2}(x)+\\cfrac{1}{a_{3}(x)+\\cdots}}}\\ ] ] can be represented either by a uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system which is based on an infinite alphabet and hence has infinite topological entropy , or by a non - uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system based on a finite alphabet and having finite topological entropy .",
    "obviously , for these two systems the standard theory of multifractals ( see e.g. @xcite ) does not apply , and therefore it is an interesting task to give a multifractal analysis for these two number theoretical dynamical systems .",
    "there is a well known result which gives some information in the generic situation , that is for a set of full @xmath2-dimensional lebesgue measure @xmath3 .",

    "there are two classical results by khintchin and lvy @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite which allow a closer inspection of the limit @xmath11 .",
    "that is , for @xmath3-almost every @xmath6 we have , with @xmath12 , @xmath13 clearly , dividing the sequence in @xmath14 by the sequence in @xmath15 leads to the sequence in @xmath11 . therefore ,",
    "if we define the level sets @xmath16 then these classical results by lvy and khintchin imply for the hausdorff dimensions ( @xmath17 ) of these level sets @xmath18 a natural question to ask is what happens to this relation between these hausdorff dimensions for prescribed non - generic limit behavior .",
    "our first main results in this paper will give an answer to this question .",

    "we introduce certain cocycles which are relevant in our multifractal analysis .",
