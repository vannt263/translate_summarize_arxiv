    "the average residence time of cosmic rays ( cr ) in the milky way is a very important quantity in high energy astrophysics , and is a key element to determine the power required to generate the galactic cr . the most direct way to estimate",
    "the average residence time is the measurement of the suppression , due to radioactive decay , of the flux of an unstable nucleus that has a lifetime comparable with the residence time . a longer residence time obviously implies a larger decay probability and a smaller flux .",
    "the comparison of the fluxes of two isotopes of the same chemical element , one stable and the other unstable allows to measure the decay suppression for the unstable particle , and the result can then be used to estimate the lifetime of the cr particles .    the most attractive element to perform this program is beryllium that has two stable isotopes ( @xmath2be and @xmath3be ) and one unstable ( @xmath4be ) with half  life @xmath5  myr @xcite .",
    "beryllium is a very rare element in ordinary matter , and essentially all beryllium nuclei in the cosmic rays have not been directly accelerated , but are `` secondaries '' formed by the fragmentation of heavier nuclei , mostly carbon and oxygen , as they interact with the interstellar gas .",
    "this implies that the injection rates for the different isotopes can be calculated from a knowledge of the fluxes of the primary nuclei and of the relevant fragmentation cross sections .",
    "more explicitely one can write the injection rate ( at the energy per nucleon @xmath6 and the space point @xmath7 ) of the isotope @xmath8 in the form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the density of the interstellar medium gas , @xmath11 is the density of cr nuclei of type @xmath12 at the same energy per nucleon , @xmath13 is the total charge changing cross section for nucleus @xmath12 , and @xmath14 the fraction of interactions where a nucleus of type @xmath8 is produced .",
    "the summation is in principle extended to all nuclei of sufficiently large mass , but in practice it is dominated by the contributions of carbon and oxygen . in equation ( [ eq : injection ] ) we have also used the ( good ) approximation that the nuclear fragments emerge from the interaction with the same velocity as the primary nucleus , or equivalently with the same energy per nucleon .    the ratio between the fluxes of beryllium10 and beryllium9 at a fixed energy per nucleon ( left implicit in the notation ) can then be written as the product of three factors : @xmath15 in this equation the factor @xmath16 is the ratio of the injections for the two isotopes calculated using equation ( [ eq : injection ] ) and the assumption that the shape of the energy spectra for the different nuclear types is independent from the space coordinates .",
    "the factor @xmath17 takes into account the fact that , even neglecting the effects of decay for beryllium10 , the propagation properties of the two isotopes are not identical .",
    "this is because nuclei of the two isotopes with the same energy per nucleon have rigidities that differ by a factor 10/9 , and their absorption due to interaction with the interstellar gas are not identical because of small differences in their cross sections .",
    "finally , the factor @xmath18 takes into account the effect of decay for the flux of the unstable nucleus .    assuming that the energy of a cosmic ray nucleus remains constant after the injection , and using the notation @xmath19 for the ( normalized ) distribution of the time @xmath20 elapsed between the instants of injection and observation of a particle , the average survival probability can be calculated as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the decay time of the isotope ( with @xmath23 the lorentz factor of the particles at the energy under study ) .",
    "the distribution @xmath24 must be calculated _ neglecting decay_.    measurements of the beryllium ratio for nuclei with kinetic energy in the interval 70150  mev per nucleon have been obtained by different experiments @xcite , and the results have been used to estimate the cr confinement time .",
    "the cosmic ray isotope spectrometer ( cris ) collaboration aboard the advanced composition explorer spacecraft @xcite has measured the beryllium ratio @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for nuclei in the kinetic energy intervals [ 7095 ] , [ 95 - 120 ] and [ 120145 ]  mev / nucleon .",
    "the cris collaboration has estimated the product @xmath28 as approximately unity and , interpreting the result on the basis of a steady state leaky  box model , has obtained an `` escape time '' @xmath1  myr . in the leaky  box model the cosmic rays age and escape time distributions are identical and have an exponential form that is determined by the single parameter @xmath29 that has the physical meaning of the ( position independent ) average age and average escape time of the particles .",
    "the cosmic rays `` age '' and `` escape time '' are distinct concepts , the first one measures the time elapsed between the instants of injection and observation of a particle , while the second one is the total time that a particle spends in the galaxy after injection .",
    "accordingly , the age and escape time distributions are in general not identical , and they are also not unique : the age distribution depends on the point of observation , and the escape time distribution depends on the point of injection .",
    "it is intuitive that particles injected near the center ( periphery ) of the galaxy need a longer ( shorter ) time to escape , and the average age of the particles observed near ( far ) from the cr sources is shorter ( longer ) .",
    "an interpretation of the observations of beryllium10 and other unstable nuclei that goes beyond the leaky",
    " box approximation should address these ambiguities .",
    "the suppression of the flux of an unstable particle , as shown in equation ( [ eq : def0 ] ) , depends on the age distribution at the observation point .",
    "a fundamental point is that to interpret a measurement of @xmath18 to obtain information about the cosmic ray residence time ( for example to estimate @xmath30 at the solar system position ) it is necessary to make some assumption about the shape of the age distribution .",
    "the leaky  box hypothesis that the age distribution has a simple exponential form has not a good physical motivation , and uncertainties about the shape of the age distribution , could very well be ( see discussion below ) the dominant source of error in the estimate of the cr galactic residence time .",
    "it is clearly necessary to consider models of the age distributions that are more realistic and have a more robust physical motivation .    in the standard analysis , based on the leaky  box model and",
    "used in @xcite , it is assumed that the age time distribution is a simple exponential : @xmath31 the integral in equation ( [ eq : def0 ] ) can then be easily performed with the result : @xmath32",
    "inverting this equation one finds : @xmath33    before entering the discussion of how to construct a realistic model for the distribution @xmath24 is can be instructive , for a qualitative understanding of how much the estimate of @xmath30 is sensitive to the shape of the distribution , to consider a simple generalization of the exponential distribution of form : @xmath34 ( an exponential multiplied by a power law of exponent @xmath35 ) .",
    "this form depends on two parameters , the average age @xmath36 and the adimensional exponent @xmath35 ( that can assume any value in the range @xmath37 ) .",
    "for @xmath38 the distribution function reduces to a simple exponential , for @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) the distribution has an excess of short ( long ) times .    inserting the age distribution ( [ eq : form1 ] ) in equation ( [ eq : def0 ] )",
    "one obtains : @xmath41 or inverting @xmath42 equations ( [ eq : psurv1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tage1 ] ) are the generalizations of ( [ eq : psurv0 ] ) and ( [ eq : tage0 ] ) that are recovered for @xmath38 .",
    "the important point is that the relation between @xmath30 , and the survival probability @xmath18 depends strongly on the parameter @xmath35 . for large @xmath43 ) ( and small @xmath18 ) one has the relation @xmath44 , or @xmath45 , that is very sensitive to the value of @xmath35 .",
    "more in general , one can observes that the relation between @xmath30 , and @xmath18 , is approximately independent from the shape of the distribution only when @xmath43 is small and @xmath18 is close to unity .",
    "in fact , developing in series the exponential in equation ( [ eq : def0 ] ) one can write @xmath18 as the series : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the @xmath48th moment of the distribution . when the lifetime of the particles is short ( and @xmath18 is close to unity )",
    "one can keep only the first term in the series , and the relation between @xmath18 and @xmath30 is unique , but in general the dependence of the shape ( encoded in the moments @xmath49 ) can not be neglected . in the concrete situation that has emerged from the observations , where the quantity @xmath18 is of order 0.12 , the shape of the residence time distribution is likely to be very important .    in this work",
    "we address the problem outlined above , constructing a framework to compute the cr residence and escape time distributions the age distributions can then used to interpret the beryllium ratio measurements .",
    "we have tried to construct framework that is much more realistic than the unphysical leaky  box model , but that remains sufficiently simple ( it will contains only three parameters ) to yield exact analytic expressions for quantities of interest .",
    "the work is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the simple 1dimensional diffusion model for propagation in the galaxy , that is the basis of our calculations , and compute the shape of the escape time distributions ( that depends on the particle injection point ) . in section  [ sec : age ]",
    "we compute the age distributions ( that are a function of the observation point ) . in section  [ sec : psurv ] we compute the average survival probability @xmath50 and study its relation with the cr lifetime .",
    "the final section gives a brief summary and some conclusions .",
    "diffusion models are in broad use for the description of the propagation of cosmic rays in the milky way ( see for example @xcite . in this work",
    "we will adopt what can be considered as a `` minimal '' diffusion model , where as the cr galactic confinement volume one takes all space between the parallel planes @xmath51 ( the subscripts stands for halo ) .",
    "these boundary planes are considered as absorption surfaces , and the volume between the planes is considered as filled by a homogeneous diffusive medium , characterized by the isotropic diffusion coefficient @xmath52 .",
    "the assumption of an infinitely large confinement volume is a reasonable approximation if the vertical size of the cr halo @xmath53 is much smaller than the galactic radius .",
    "the motivation for introducing this approximation is that the calculation of the propagation of cosmic rays is reduced to a 1dimensional problem that has an exact analytic solution .",
    "in general the diffusion coefficient will be a function of the particle energy ( one expects a dependence of form @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the particle rigidity and @xmath56 its velocity ) , but in this work we will not need to specify the functional form of the energy ( or rigidity ) dependence of the diffusion coefficient , because we will only discuss the propagation of nuclei , and assume that the energy of the particles remain constant after injection without energy loss or reacceleration .",
    "the energy can then be simply considered as a parameter that labels the propagation of different particle types . in most of the following discussion the energy dependence of the different quantities",
    "will be left implicit in the notation .    in our framework",
    "the only parameter wih the dimension of length is the halo half height @xmath53 , and by dimensional analysis one can construct only a single independent quantity with the dimension of time , the diffusion time @xmath57 the average escape time and age of the cosmic rays ( for a fixed energy ) will of course be proportional to @xmath58 , times adimensional coefficients that will be calculated below .",
    "neglecting energy loss , but allowing for decay and interaction , the number density @xmath59 of cosmic rays with energy @xmath60 at the point @xmath7 at the time @xmath20 can be obtained from the injection rate @xmath61 solving , with appropriate boundary conditions , the partial differential equation : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the interaction and decay time of the particle . in equation ( [ eq : diff1 ] )",
    "we have assumed that the interaction rate of a particle is independent from the position @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that the insterstellar gas density is cosidered homogeneous in the cosmic ray confinement volume . in the following",
    "we will neglect the effects of interactions on secondary nuclei .",
    "the inclusion , of these effects is straightforward if one makes the hypothesis that the gas distribution is homogeneous , more difficult in the general case .",
    "the general solution of the diffusion equation ( [ eq : diff1 ] ) can be expressed in terms of the green function @xmath65 that gives the probability density that a particle initially at the point @xmath66 is at the point @xmath7 after a time @xmath20 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of cosmic rays injected per unit time and unit volume at the point @xmath7 at the time @xmath20 .",
    "a derivation of equation ( [ eq : diffa ] ) is simple .",
    "for propagation in a homogeneous , isotropic diffusive medium with no boundaries , it is well known that the green function is a gaussian of width @xmath72 . in the presence of the two parallel absorption surfaces at @xmath73 ( see @xcite ) , the green function becomes the superposition of an infinite number of gaussian functions all of the same width .",
    "one of the gaussians is centered on the real physical source at the point with coordinates @xmath74 , the others correspond to an infinite number of `` mirror '' sinks and sources placed symmetrically outside the diffusion volume .",
    "the sources are located at points @xmath75 with : @xmath76 ( the source with @xmath38 is the real physical one ) .",
    "the sinks have coordinates @xmath77 with : @xmath78 in the presence of interaction and/or decay , the green function becomes : @xmath79    to compute the escape time distribution one can note that the integral of the green function @xmath80 over the entire galaxy volume ( @xmath81 ) : @xmath82 gives a result that is unity for @xmath83 and decreases monotonically with @xmath20 , vanishing for @xmath84 .",
    "this is the consequence of escape , or formally absorption at the planes @xmath73    the escape time distribution for a particle that is injected at the point @xmath66 can then be calculated as : @xmath85 the expression is automatically normalized to unity ( for integration in the range @xmath86 ) . the space integration and time derivative in equations ( [ eq : nn0 ] ) and ( [ eq : fesc0 ] ) can be easily performed to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath87 .",
    "our model is effectively unidimensional , and the escape time distribution depends only on the @xmath88 coordinate of the injection point , and has a scaling form : @xmath89 where @xmath58 is the characteristic diffusion time given in equation ( [ eq : tdiff ] ) , and the function @xmath90 is : @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 . for numerical studies",
    "the series in equation ( [ eq : ffesc ] ) converges very rapidly including the first few terms with @xmath94 small .",

    "[ fig : fescape1 ] . inspecting these figures one can see that for large @xmath20 ( @xmath95 ) the distribution approaches asymptotically the exponential form @xmath96 with a slope @xmath97 that is independent from the injection point . for small @xmath20 the distribution vanishes , reflecting the fact that the particles need a finite time to reach one of the boundaries of the diffusion volume after injection .",
    "the average escape time can be calculated exactly resumming the series , with the result : @xmath98 \\label{eq : tescav}\\ ] ] the average escape time is maximum for particles injected in the central plane ( @xmath99 ) , when one has @xmath100 , and decreases quadratically with @xmath101 , when the particle is injected closer to one of the boundaries of the galaxy , vanishing for injection at the boundary of the diffusion volume ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the age distribution for particles at the point @xmath7 can be obtained from equation ( [ eq : n - integration ] ) : @xmath103 the injection rate @xmath104 enter in the definition , so the age distribution is determined also by the space and time dependence of the injection .    in the following , in the spirit of constructing simple , exactly solvable models we will consider an injection that is stationary ( independent from @xmath20 ) and has a very simple space dependence . we will use two models for the injection : the `` slab disk '' , and the `` exponential disk '' . in both models",
    "the injection depends only on the @xmath88 coordinate , and is determined by a single parameter ( with dimension of length ) that gives the spatial thickness of the emission . in the slab disk model",
    "the injection is homogeneous in the central region of the halo @xmath105 and vanishes outside : @xmath106 the parameter @xmath107 can take values in the interval @xmath108 .    in the exponential disk model the injection has the form @xmath109 where the parameter @xmath110 can take values in the interval @xmath111 .",
    "the two models are identical when their parameters are at the extremes of their intervals of definitions , that is for @xmath112 , when the injection volume is reduced to a plane , and for @xmath113 or @xmath114 , when the injection is homogeneous in the entire confinement volume .",

    "it is virtually certain that the cr sources are in the visible disk of the galaxy , with a vertical extension of order 0.10.15  kpc .",
    "therefore in good approximation the ratio @xmath119 or @xmath120 can be interpreted as the inverse of the vertical extension of the cr halo .",
    "the observations suggest that the cosmic rays in our galaxy are confined in a volume that is significantly larger than the visible disk , with a vertical extension of several kpc .",
    "this implies that the leaky  box interpretation of the beryllium isotope ration gives a residence is underestimated by a factor 2 to 4 for a halo half  thickness between 1 and 5  kpc .",
    "the average residence time of cosmic rays in the milky way is an important quantity that plays a fundamental role in the estimate of the power of the galactic accelerators .",
    "the best method to determine this residence time is the study of the flux of unstable nuclei with a lifetime of appropriate duration .",
    "measurements of the ratio beryllium10/beryllium9 for nuclei with kinetic energy of order 100  mev / nucleon indicate that the flux of the unstable isotope is suppressed by a factor @xmath185 with respect to to what is expected in the absence of decay .",
    "the result clearly shows that the beryllium nuclei have a residence time of the same order of the decay time , but a quantitative estimate requires several assumptions about the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy .",
    "the simplest scheme to interpret the beryllium ratio measurements is the so called leaky  box model that gives @xcite an average escape time @xmath186  myr .",
    "the leaky  box model has the merit of a remarkable simplicity , in fact it can be considered as a `` zero  dimension '' model where the confinement volume of the cosmic rays is not specified , and the density and injection of the particles are not allowed any dependence on the space coordinates .",
    "these unphysical assumptions could ( and in fact do ) result in a large bias for the estimate of the cr average residence time , and it is clearly very desirable to discuss the problem in models that are more realistic and have a more robust physical motivation .",
    "some rather elaborate numerical codes like galprop @xcite or dragon @xcite have been developed for the study of the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy and can be used to study numerically the confinement of cosmic rays . in this work",
    "we have taken the approach of constructing a model that is reasonably realistic , but also sufficiently simple to yield analytic solutions for the quantities of interest , so that the dependence on the model parameters is explicit and transparent , offering a better understanding of the problem .",
    "the framework that we have discussed in this work can be seen as a `` minimal '' extension of the leaky  box model , and introduces a minimum number ( three ) of parameters .",
    "the framework is a one  dimensional diffusion model , where the galaxy is an infinite slab of half ",
    "thickness @xmath53 .",
    "a second parameter determines the space distribution of the cosmic ray sources ( the quantity @xmath107 that gives the half  thickness of the injection volume , or alternatively the slope @xmath110 for an exponential space distribution of the cr injection ) .",
    "a third parameter ( for any given rigidity ) is the isotropic diffusion coefficient @xmath52 .",
    "the characteristic time for escape from the confinement volume is then @xmath187 .    in this simple framework",
    "one can compute exactly the escape time and residence time distributions for any possible set of the model parameters . the age and escape time distributions are distinct from each other and are not unique because they depend on the coordinates of the particle injection point ( for the escape time ) or observation point ( for the age time ) .",
    "the average values @xmath188 and @xmath189 are proportional to @xmath58 times a space  dependent , adimensional coefficient that depends only on the ratio @xmath119 or @xmath120 .",
    "the distinction between escape time and age does not exist in the leaky  box model , but is important in a more general discussion of the cosmic ray residence time .",
    "the most interesting result we have obtained is a simple , closed form expression for the average survival probability of an unstable particle @xmath50 that depends on the @xmath88 coordinate of the observation point , and is a function of the ratio @xmath154 ( with @xmath64 the decay time of the unstable particle ) .",
    "the crucial point is that @xmath50 also depends on the ratio @xmath119 ( or @xmath120 ) between the injection and confinement volumes .",
    "the bottom line is that given a measurement of @xmath50 that gives the flux suppression for an unstable nucleis , the estimate of the characteristic time @xmath58 ( proportional to the average escape time and age of the cosmic rays ) depends on the ratio between the injection and confinement volumes for the cosmic rays or , assuming that the injection volume is known , only on the size of the cosmic ray halo .",
    "if the injection and confinement volumes are approximately equal , the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath18 is very close to what is estimated in the leaky  box model , but when the confinement volume ( or @xmath53 ) grows , the estimate of @xmath58 ( for a fixed value of @xmath18 ) increases monotonically . for a vertical size of the galactic cr halo of order @xmath190  kpc ,",

    "<S> the most reliable method to estimate the residence time of cosmic rays in the galaxy is based on the study of the suppression , due to decay , of the flux of unstable nuclei such as beryllium10 , that have lifetime of appropriate duration . the cosmic ray isotope spectrometer ( cris ) collaboration has measured the ratio between the fluxes of beryllium10 and beryllium9 in the energy range @xmath0145  mev / nucleon , and has used the data to estimate an escape time @xmath1  myr . </S>",
    "<S> this widely quoted result has been obtained in the framework of a simple leaky  box model where the distributions of escape time and age for stable particles in the galaxy are identical and have exponential form . in general , the escape time and age distributions do not coincide , they are not unique ( because they depend on the injection or observation point ) , and do not have a simple exponential shape . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore necessary to discuss the measurement of the beryllium ratio in a framework that is more general and more realistic than the leaky  box model .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we compute the escape time and age distributions of cosmic rays in the galaxy in a model based on diffusion that is much more realistic than the simple leaky  box , but that remains sufficiently simple to have exact analytic solutions . using the age distributions of the model to interpret the measurements of the beryllium10 suppression , one obtains a cosmic ray residence time that is significantly longer ( a factor 2 to 4 depending on the extension of the cosmic ray halo ) than the leaky  box estimate . </S>",
    "<S> this revised residence time implies a proportional reduction of the power needed to generate the galactic cosmic rays . </S>"
