    "the x - ray luminosities of solar - type stars , when they are very young , are prodigious .",
    "indeed , it is now well established that low - mass pre ",
    "main - sequence ( pms ) stars can emit x - rays at levels up to @xmath1 times that of the present - day sun ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but after two decades of research since t  tauri stars ( ttss ) were first identified as strong x - ray sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we still do not know the origins of x - ray production in young stars .    while flares observed in the x - ray light curves suggest that the x - rays are produced mainly in solar - analog magnetic reconnection flares , the absence of an obvious rotation - activity relation in these stars prevents a clear association of the x - rays to dynamo - generated fields @xcite .",
    "the flares can be so powerful that non - solar geometries of the magnetic fields must be considered , including field lines linking the star with the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "in addition , the role of accretion is unclear , and may affect the production of x - rays either directly or indirectly .",
    "for example , energetic shocks associated with accretion flows at or near the stellar surface may enhance x - ray production , as has been suggested in the detailed spectroscopic analyses of tw  hya @xcite and bp  tau @xcite . at the same time , the mass - loading of magnetic field lines may actually inhibit x - ray production in accreting systems , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "these issues are reviewed more fully in @xcite .",
    "we have undertaken a synoptic study of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) combining a nearly continuous , 13-d _ chandra _ observation with simultaneous , multi - wavelength , time - series photometry in the optical .",
    "a specific motivation is to establish the incidence of time - correlated x - ray and optical variability in order to begin disentangling the roles of magnetic and accretion activity in the production of x - rays .",
    "for example , accretion shocks on the surfaces of classical ttss ( cttss ; ttss that still possess accretion disks ) produce strong variability at optical wavelengths , caused by time - variable accretion , rotational modulation of accretion  hot spots , \" or both @xcite .",
    "if x - rays are produced near the sites of accretion shocks , then one might expect that changes in the strength of these shocks will induce changes in the strength of the x - ray emission , and that x - ray and optical variability might therefore be correlated in time .",
    "alternatively , x - rays may originate in coronal structures associated with magnetically active regions on these stars , in which case we might expect that x - ray emission will be more pronounced when the magnetically active regions ( which appear as dark photospheric spots in the optical ) face toward us , and least pronounced when these regions face away from us ; that is , optical and x - ray variability will be anti - correlated in time .",
    "more complex behavior may result from the superposition of these effects , emphasizing the need for time - resolved measurements .",
    "more generally , by establishing the frequency with which x - ray and optical variations are co - temporal , we seek to constrain the extent to which the sources of the x - ray and optical variability may be co - spatial or otherwise causally linked .",
    "detailed analyses of simultaneous , time - resolved x - ray and optical variability have previously been reported for three pms stars : the cttss v773  tau @xcite and bp  tau @xcite , and the weak - lined tts ( wtts ) v410  tau @xcite . in none of these were the optical and x - ray variability found to be time - correlated .",
    "unfortunately , in all three cases the statistical significance of the results were limited by the short duration of the x - ray observations : v773  tau was observed by rosat for 6.7  hr , bp  tau was observed by rosat for 8  hr , and v410  tau was observed by _",
    "chandra _ for 7.2  hr .",
    "the combined x - ray / optical dataset reported here includes some 800 members of the onc and thus represents , by a factor of hundreds , the largest attempt to date to study the relationship between x - ray and optical variability in pms stars .",
    "we will report results from this database in stages , focusing first on statistical properties of the study sample as a whole . in this first paper",
    ", we establish the incidence of _ time - correlated _ optical and x - ray variability . a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) focuses on _ time - averaged _ measures of optical and x - ray variability , and on the relationship between these variability indicators and basic stellar properties .",
    "this database will then form the basis for follow - up studies focusing on fine - grained analyses of individual objects .    in  [ data ]",
    ", we present the x - ray and optical time - series database that forms the basis for these studies and describe the methods that we employ in this paper to search for time - correlated x - ray / optical variability . in  [ corr - time ] , we identify 40 candidate stars with possible time - correlated optical and x - ray variability , and classify them according to common light - curve characteristics to guide follow - up study of these interesting objects .",
    "importantly , these candidates represent at most @xmath2% of our study sample ; @xmath3% of the stars in our sample exhibit no evidence for time - correlated optical and x - ray variability .",
    "as we discuss in  [ discussion ] , these results imply that the sites of optical and x - ray variability in pms stars are not  in the vast majority of cases  instantaneously one and the same .",
    "a direct causal link between the sources of optical and x - ray variability in pms stars is not supported by our study .",
    "we summarize our findings in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "as the foundation for the synoptic x - ray / optical database used in this and follow - up studies , we use the deep x - ray observation of the onc obtained by collaboration .",
    "details of the coup dataset are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , the onc was observed by the _ chandra _ acis detector ( energy passband of 0.510 kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from 8 jan 2003 to 21 jan 2003 for a total of 849  ks ( 9.8 days ) , representing the deepest x - ray observation of a star - forming region ever obtained .",
    "there were five small gaps of @xmath4 ks each ( when the spacecraft passed through the van allen belts ) , but the data stream is otherwise continuous over a total timespan of 13.2 days . within the acis 17 @xmath5 17 field of view centered on the trapezium ,",
    "1616 point sources were identified , of which @xmath6 are associated onc stars @xcite . for each of these",
    ", @xcite performed a spectral extraction and analysis from which they derived the source s x - ray luminosity @xmath7 and other parameters .",
    "most importantly for our present purposes , they also performed an analysis of photon arrival times , providing measures of each source s x - ray variability and yielding for each source a nearly continuous x - ray light curve spanning 13.2-d .",
    "the coup database also includes a compilation of a number of other physical characteristics for each source from photometric and spectroscopic catalogs already in the literature . for our purposes in this and follow - up studies ,",
    "the most relevant of these is the equivalent width ( ew ) of the infrared triplet from @xcite , which serves as a measure of the mass accretion rate in each object .      to complement this unique and rich database of x - ray light curves and ancillary data , we organized a simultaneous , multi - band , ground - based monitoring campaign , with the aim of obtaining well - sampled optical light curves that overlap well with the x - ray light curves . using small telescopes at two observing sites to minimize diurnal observing gaps , we repeatedly imaged the same field as that observed by _",
    "acis , cycling through the @xmath0 filters , and alternating between short and long exposure times in each filter to maximize the dynamic range of the observations .",
    "constraints in scheduling the ground - based observations together with uncertainties in the scheduling of the _ chandra _ observations prevented us from obtaining optical data at the start of the _ chandra _ exposure .",
    "the optical observations begin 6 days after the start of the 13.2-d x - ray observation , and continue for 2 days beyond , for a total overlap of 7.2  d.    we observed with the wiyn 0.9-m telescope at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) in arizona , usa , over the period ut 2003 jan 1525 . due to poor weather",
    ", no data were obtained on the night of ut 2003 jan 18 . at the same time , we observed with the 1.5-m cassini telescope in loiano , italy , over the period ut 2003 jan 1522 , with no data obtained on the nights of ut 2003 jan 16 , 17 , 20 , 21 .",
    "exposure times were varied slightly to compensate for variable observing conditions , but were otherwise similar at both sites .",
    "typical exposure times were 5  s in @xmath0 for short exposures , 420  s for long exposures in @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and 720  s for long exposures in @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we typically obtained a total of @xmath12 measurements per filter per night , in both short and long exposures , with a cadence of @xmath13  hr@xmath14 .",
    "a log of the optical observations is presented in table [ obs - table ] .",
    "the images were reduced , and instrumental magnitudes for all point sources extracted , using standard iraf procedures .",
    "differential light curves were determined from psf photometry using an algorithm for inhomogeneous ensemble photometry @xcite as implemented in @xcite for observations of high - nebulosity regions such as the onc .",
    "systematic offsets between the kpno and loiano observations were adjusted by comparing the instrumental magnitudes of non - variable stars .",
    "all differential light curves are available in electronic format from the authors . calibrated mean",
    "optical magnitudes for each star are reported in the coup database .    in order to cross -",
    "identify the optical sources with the x - ray sources in the coup database , we first determined the optical identifications of the stars from the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite using a 15 matching radius .",
    "we then used these optical identifications to associate each object with its x - ray counterpart in the coup database using the table of cross - identifications provided by @xcite . in this way",
    ", we were able to unambiguously associate 814 optical sources with x - ray counterparts in the coup database .",
    "these 814 objects span a very large range of apparent magnitudes and colors , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and a correspondingly large range of spectral types and extinctions , b3 @xmath17 spty @xmath17 m7 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this sample is thus representative of the underlying onc population ; only the very massive , heavily obscured , and sub - stellar populations are excluded .    an unavoidable consequence of this breadth of stellar properties is that objects do not appear with uniform frequency in our optical light curves . for example , the brightest objects appear only in the short - exposure light curves , being saturated in the long - exposure frames .",
    "similarly , the coolest and the most heavily reddened objects appear only in the long - wavelength passbands . in addition",
    ", some objects near the bright and faint extremes of our survey have more sparsely sampled light curves , as variations in observing conditions ( e.g.  seeing , sky transparency , background ) cause these objects to be lost from some exposures .",
    "thus , any individual object in our final database possesses between 1 and 8 different optical light curves ( @xmath0 filters , long and short exposures ) with time sampling patterns that are very similar but , for the reasons already noted , not identical .",
    "of course , objects whose characteristics are intermediate to the extremes discussed above possess the most complete set of optical light curves and the most complete time sampling .      the stars in our",

    "we describe the methods we use to measure and to correlate variability in the x - ray and optical light curves in our database .      to quantify the time - averaged x - ray variability of the stars in our database , we use the bayesian block ( bb ) analysis provided by the coup @xcite . briefly , the bb analysis @xcite segments each light curve into the maximum number of time blocks such that the differences in the mean flux levels of the blocks are statistically significant .",
    "the bb analysis thus yields a robust measure of the maximum and minimum flux levels in the source s segmented x - ray light curve ( bb@xmath19  and bb@xmath20 , respectively ) ; we use the statistic @xmath21bb@xmath19/bb@xmath20@xmath22 to quantify the magnitude of variability in the x - ray light curve .",

    "[ coup1499][coup132 ] are representative of the behavior observed in our database as a whole .",
    "in general , we find examples of optical and x - ray variability in every possible permutation : we find stars that are highly variable in both optical and x - ray light ( e.g.  fig .",

    "[ coup75 ] ) and vice - versa ( e.g.  fig .  [ coup132 ] ) , and stars that are non - variable altogether .",

    "in this section we present the results of our analysis of time - correlated optical and x - ray variability in our database of 814 coup sources with simultaneous optical and x - ray light curves .",
    "we identify 40 candidate stars whose optical and x - ray light curves appear to be correlated or anti - correlated in time .",
    "these represent the first such cases yet reported for pms stars , and we classify these objects according to possible physical origins for the observed variability . more generally , however , time - correlated variability evidently occurs very rarely in our study sample .      following the procedure described in  [ corr ] , we have searched for time - correlated variability in the optical and x - ray light curves of the 814 stars in our database .",
    "forty stars show evidence for the x - ray light curve being time - correlated with at least one optical light curve on the basis of a non - parametric kendall s @xmath33 test (  [ corr ] ) .",

    "it is probable that a number of these candidates will be spurious . estimating the number of expected false positives accurately is complicated by the fact that a given star may possess multiple optical light curves that are not statistically independent .",
    "we may , however , estimate an upper limit to the expected number of false positives , given that we adopted a kendall s @xmath33 null - hypothesis probability of 0.01 as our criterion for identifying these candidates , and that our search for time - correlated variability in our sample of 814 stars involves 1944 different @xmath0 optical light curves (  [ corr ] ) .",

    ", we have additionally performed a monte carlo simulation in which we applied the kendall s @xmath33 test to one million random pairings of our optical and x - ray light curves , and we find that kendall s @xmath33 probabilities of less than 0.01 occur with a frequency of 1.4% , very close to the expected value of 1.0% .",
    "the candidates listed in table [ correlated - table ] include a total of 63 @xmath0 light curves that are found to be time - correlated with their associated x - ray light curves according to kendall s @xmath33 , and thus represent a @xmath40 detection of time - correlated variability over the expected number of false positives .",
    "it is not possible on the basis of these statistical arguments alone to determine which of these candidates are the false positives and which are the true time - correlated variables . in many cases , the appearance of the x - ray and optical variations",
    "are quite dissimilar , so the statistical correlation may often not arise from a physical correlation .",
    "some candidates might nonetheless be regarded as more credible than others based on the number of their optical light curves that pass the kendall s @xmath33 test .",

    "in contrast , coup  1309 ( fig .",
    "[ coup1309 ] ) also has four optical light curves , none of which appear to be convincingly correlated with the x - ray light curve , and indeed only one of them is identified as time - correlated by the kendall s @xmath33 statistic . in other cases , only one optical light curve is identified as being time - correlated with the x - ray light curve even though the other optical light curves share a similar morphology .",
    "for example , in coup  152 ( fig.[coup152 ] ) the @xmath8- and @xmath10-band light curves are not identified as time - correlated , despite a very similar morphology to the @xmath9-band light curve .",
    "common sense suggests that this is not a physically meaningful result ; instead , it is likely that small , random noise differences among the optical light curves allow just one of them to pass the 0.01 kendall s @xmath33 probability threshold .",
    "such a precarious correlation is less credible than , e.g. , the case of coup  122 ( fig .",
    "[ coup122 ] ) noted above .",
    "the reader may wish to apply other subjective criteria to the light curves shown in figs .",
    "[ coup28][coup1608 ] .",
    "we thus do not attempt to identify specific candidates in table [ correlated - table ] as definitive .",
    "rather , we emphasize that these 40 candidates have been identified on an objective , statistical basis and that an estimated upper limit on the number of false positives suggests that @xmath41 of these candidates may represent _ bona fide _ cases of time - correlated optical and x - ray variability .",
    "this implies an overall incidence of time - correlated variability in our sample of @xmath42% .",
    "time - correlated optical and x - ray variability is evidently an uncommon phenomenon in our sample .",
    "if x - ray production in pms stars is connected to accretion related processes , we might expect time - correlated optical / x - ray variability to be more common among actively accreting stars , as these stars may be more likely to have their optical variability dominated by accretion .",
    "following previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the criterion that we adopt for identifying the presence of accretion is thus in practice a conservative one ; stars with ew [ ]  @xmath43   and ew [ ]  @xmath44   are securely identified as accretors and non - accretors , while some stars with indeterminate values close to 0   may be weakly accreting objects that will go unidentified as such . ] .",

    ", we suggest physical interpretations for the origins of the observed variability .",
    "note that , due to the often complex nature of the observed variability , some stars are not classified while others may be included in more than one category ( see table  [ correlated - table ] for an overview ) .",
    "this discussion is presented to highlight what may represent the first examples in the literature of time - correlated optical and x - ray variability among pms stars , and to guide follow - up investigation of these specific objects .",
    "we remind the reader that in fact the overwhelming majority of the stars in our study sample do not exhibit evidence for time - correlated optical and x - ray variability .",
    "several stars show periodic or quasi - periodic modulations in their optical light curve(s ) on time scales that appear to be consistent with optical variability periods ( @xmath46 ) reported for them in the literature .",
    "the persistence of the periodicity suggests that it is related to the stars rotation periods and that we are seeing either dark spots in regions of magnetic activity , or accretion hot spots , rotating in and out of view . at the same time , these stars x - ray light curves exhibit typical coronal flare - like morphologies that are coincident in time with extrema in the optical light curves .",
    "this type of behavior is found both in cases for which the x - ray / optical correlations are positive and negative , and among both accretors and non - accretors .",
    "sources for which an x - ray flare coincides with optical maximum ( positive correlations ) include , , , , and .",
    "sources for which an x - ray flare coincides with optical minimum ( anti - correlations ) include , , and .",
    "additional stars that can be included in this category are those with no previously reported @xmath46 but which still show gradual ( and possibly periodic ) modulations in at least one optical light curve .",
    "sources for which an x - ray flare coincides with optical maximum ( positive correlations ) include , , and .",
    "sources for which an x - ray flare coincides with optical minimum ( anti - correlations ) include , , and .    finally , there are some stars whose time - correlations are dominated by other behavior ( see groups b / c below ) but which in addition exhibit x - ray flares near optical maximum or minimum .",
    "sources for which an x - ray flare coincides with optical maximum include and .",
    "sources for which an x - ray flare coincides with optical minimum include and .",
    "it is possible that these stars represent examples of physical associations between regions of x - ray flaring and stellar spots  either hot accretion spots ( positive correlations ) or dark magnetic spots ( anti - correlations ) .",
    "however , it is also possible that these stars represent a more general class of objects that show periodic rotational modulation and x - ray flares with no preferred correlation with rotational phase .",
    "for example , if we assume a typical @xmath46 of 6  d , and that x - ray flares occur randomly in time with a typical duration of 0.3  d , then the probability of finding either a correlation or anti - correlation is @xmath47% .",
    "moreover , among the ten cases of positive correlations included above , only three show clear evidence of active accretion . in any case ,",
    "detailed follow - up of these stars in comparison to the full sample of coup sources showing x - ray flares should help resolve these interpretations .",
    "we have found several stars that show gradual and periodic or quasi - periodic variations in both their optical and x - ray light curves ; in particular , the x - ray light curves do not exhibit the flare - like features that characterize the objects in group  a. assuming that modulation in the x - ray light curve indicates the presence of a stable structure ( within the time span of the _ chandra _ observation ) that moves in and out of view as the star rotates , its origin could be a bright accretion spot or a magnetically active region on the stellar surface . in the first case , a positive correlation with the optical light curves might be expected . in the second , an x - ray ",
    "bright coronal feature accompanied by a photospheric dark spot would give rise to anti - correlated behavior .",
    "there are nine cases for which the x - ray and optical light curves produce a net anti - correlation : , , , , , , , and . with the exception of the last object , which showed weak signatures of active accretion in the observations of @xcite , the available ew [ ]  measurements are consistent with these stars all being non - accretors , and therefore implying that the photometric and x - ray variations are not related to accretion .",
    "all but one star ( coup 1521 ) have previously published optical periods , and the variability observed in our optical light curves is fully consistent with those periods .",
    "in addition , the x - ray light curves of three of these stars ( coup 161 , 1355 , and 1521 ) have been independently found by @xcite to be periodic , with x - ray periods @xmath48 that are equal to the optical periods ( i.e.  @xmath49 ; see table  [ correlated - table ] ) , corroborating the interpretation that the x - ray variability arises from rotational modulation . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "this rotational modulation implies that the x - ray emission is produced in close proximity to the stellar surface , such that the x - ray emitting region is occulted as it rotates to the back side of the star .",
    "these objects thus represent compelling cases of stars having stable coronal structures that are in close spatial proximity to  and likely to be physically linked with ",

    "that is , the light curves exhibit two x - ray modulations for each optical modulation .",
    "this is particularly evident in ( fig .",
    "[ coup139 ] ) . of course",
    ", this behavior may simply be the result of randomly repeating flares and/or randomly elevated x - ray emission levels , as discussed for the group  a stars .",
    "another interpretation is that the stellar coronae in these cases have two x - ray bright regions , separated by @xmath51 in longitude , but that we only see a dark , magnetically active region on the stellar surface associated with one of them .",
    "[ coup1590 ] ) , which exhibits an x - ray light curve that appears to oscillate between two different amplitudes , may be a case in point .",
    "in addition to these stars with anti - correlated light curves , there are 14 stars that exhibit positive correlations in their x - ray / optical light curves .",
    "they are : , , , , , , , , and .",
    "@xcite have searched for periodicity in the x - ray light curves of eight of these 14 stars , and have identified two of them ( and ) as having definitive periodic x - ray light curves , with periods equal to ( or half of ) the published @xmath46 .",
    "they also identified another three of these stars ( , , and ) as having  likely \" periodic x - ray light curves .",
    "thus , the incidence of periodic x - ray modulation among objects with positively correlated optical / x - ray light curves appears to be high .",
    "the positive correlation between the x - ray and optical light curves suggests that these cases represent stable x - ray ",
    "bright structures physically associated with photospheric hot spots , rotating in and out of view .",
    "these hot spots may be the footpoints of mass accretion streams on the stellar surface .",
    "alternatively , the observed positively correlated x - ray / optical light curves may represent examples of x - ray  faint coronal structures  i.e .",
    "coronal holes  that are co - spatial with dark , magnetically active regions on the stellar surface .",
    "however , an interpretation of accretion hot spots is more strongly supported by the ew [ ]  properties of these 14 stars , which include some of the strongest accretion signatures found in the entire study sample ( table  [ correlated - table ] ) . among these , ( fig .  [ coup250 ] ) is particularly interesting , having been identified by @xcite as having a periodic x - ray light curve .",
    "this star may thus be a good example of a star having stable structures that are physically associated with accretion hot spots on their surfaces .",
    "follow - up modeling and analysis of the color information contained in our multi - band optical light curves should help to clarify whether we are in fact observing hot spots in this object .",
    "many of the x - ray flares seen in the coup dataset resemble solar long - duration flares seen with the _ goes _ and _ yohkoh _ satellites which cover the _ chandra _ spectral band .",
    "the peak luminosities and durations , and hence total energies , of the coup flare plasma emission are orders of magnitude higher than seen in solar flares .",
    "but it is reasonable to suggest that , as in solar flares , the long - duration soft ( _ chandra _ band ) x - ray flares are preceeded by brief impulsive phases when particle acceleration , radio gyrosynchrotron , hard ( @xmath52 kev ) x - ray emission , and optical  white - light \" continuum increases occur ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the impulsive phase has , on rare occasions , been seen in magnetically active stars , notably the rs  cvn systems @xmath53  gem @xcite and hr  1099 @xcite and dme stars prox cen @xcite and ev  lac @xcite .",
    "two stars in our study sample and exhibit rather irregular optical light curves that show punctuated increases in brightness that are positively correlated with short - duration flares in the x - ray light curves .",
    "while these correlations may be coincidences , we think it is worthwhile to highlight these objects since they may represent the best candidates for the occurrence of white - light magnetic flares .",
    "we note that has also been identified as a candidate in groups a and b above due to the particularly complex nature of the observed variability .",
    "in particular , we caution that the optical brightening ",
    "event \" near day 10.5 may simply be related to the longer - term , quasi - periodic optical variability of this object .",
    "on the other hand , while we have very little data for , what we do have is tantalizing .",
    "a single optical measurement , brighter than the mean brightness level by @xmath54 , occurs precisely in the time bin of a very brief x - ray flare that at its peak is @xmath55 times brighter than the mean x - ray flux level for this object .",
    "we have carefully scrutinized the optical data for this star and believe the observed optical brightening event to be credible .",
    "in contrast to the strong  rotation - activity relationship \" that is clearly present on the main sequence @xcite , a series of studies based on _ chandra _ observations of a large sample of pms stars in the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) failed to find any direct correlation between the stars rotation rates and their x - ray luminosities @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for the lack of a pms rotation - activity relationship is that the x - rays originate not ( or not only ) from dynamo - generated magnetic processes , but also ( or instead ) from energetic processes related to accretion .",
    "if x - rays are produced near the sites of accretion shocks , then we may expect that x - ray and optical variability would be time - correlated .",
    "however , at most @xmath2% of the stars in our sample show credible , statistically significant , time - correlated optical and x - ray light curves (  [ corr - incidence ] ) , and this time - correlated variability is just as likely to occur among non - accreting stars as it is among accretors (  [ corr - accretion ] ) .",
    "our findings are consistent with previous studies of simultaneous x - ray and optical variability in pms stars @xcite , with a sample that is hundreds of times larger",
    ".    our results do not negate the possibility that accretion is indirectly related to x - ray production at some level .",
    "for example , the presence of an accretion disk may alter the stellar magnetospheric environment ( e.g.  via large star - disk magnetic loops ; * ? ? ? * ) such that large reconnection flares or other energetic processes take place in a way that is not possible in the absence of a disk ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such events , displaced and disconnected from magnetically active regions on the stellar surface , might not be expected to produce time - correlated behavior in x - rays and the optical .",
    "in addition , we have in fact found a small number of stars that exhibit possibly accretion - related x - ray emission , in the form of x - ray flares and x - ray ",
    "bright features that may be co - spatial with accretion hot spots on the stellar surface (  [ credible ] ) .",
    "the strong optical / x - ray brightening event observed in the fu  ori  like outburst of v1647  ori ( mcneil s nebula ) serves as a particularly dramatic example of time - correlated optical / x - ray variability that is likely to be accretion driven @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , though intriguing , such cases are evidently very rare .",
    "similarly , any physical connection of x - ray emission to magnetically active surface regions ( i.e.  cool spots ) does not for the vast majority of stars in our sample manifest itself in a time - correlated way (  [ credible ] ) .",
    "this may indicate that the x - ray emitting coronae in pms stars have spatial structures that little reflect the magnetic structure of the underlying photosphere .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that x - ray emission takes place on very large spatial scales relative to the photosphere , and may not be confined to the small surface regions ( spots ) from which the optical variability presumably originates .",
    "while this picture is at odds with the small coronae implicit in the finding of rotationally modulated x - ray emission in @xmath56% of coup sources by @xcite , such an interpretation could be consistent with the very large flaring loop sizes inferred on a small number of coup sources by @xcite .",
    "more generally , our findings are consistent with recent analyses of the x - ray spectra of cttss , and with recent measurements of the magnetic field structures of wttss . in an analysis of high - resolution x - ray spectra of the cttss",
    "bp  tau , cr  cha , su  aur , and tw  hya , @xcite conclude that both accretion shocks and coronal activity contribute to the observed x - ray emission , but that coronal activity is by far the dominant contributor in all cases except tw  hya .",
    "these results , together with our finding that time - correlated optical and x - ray variability occurs only very rarely , support the general conclusion that neither surface accretion shocks nor magnetically active surface ( cool ) spots are the exclusive sites of x - ray production in the vast majority of pms stars .",
    "we have presented a combined analysis of simultaneous optical and x - ray light curves for a sample of more than 800 pre ",
    "main - sequence ( pms ) stars in the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) .",
    "this dataset represents an increase of several hundred - fold , both in the number of objects studied and in the total duration of the x - ray and optical time - series data , over all previous investigations of simultaneous optical and x - ray variability in pms stars .",
    "we identify 40 stars that exhibit the first examples to our knowledge of time - correlated optical and x - ray variability in pms stars . among these 40 stars , we find examples of both positive and anti - correlations .",
    "positive correlations may represent x - ray ",
    "dark coronal structures associated with cool , magnetically active surface spots , or may represent x - ray ",
    "bright structures associated with hot accretion spots .",
    "anti - correlations may represent , e.g. , magnetic flaring events associated with cool surface spots . in any event ,",
    "the implication is that the x - ray emitting regions in these stars are in close proximity to  and thus likely to be physically linked with  cool and/or hot spots on their surfaces .",
    "follow - up modeling and analysis of the color information contained in our multi - band optical light curves should help to clarify whether we are observing cool or hot spots in each object .",
    "in addition , we identify two possible examples of  white - light \" flares , perhaps corresponding to the impulsive heating phase in solar - analog flares .",
    "however , these cases represent at most @xmath2% of our study sample .",
    "the remaining @xmath3% of our study sample exhibits no such time - correlated variability . evidently , time - correlated optical and x - ray variability is rare in pms stars .",
    "we conclude that the sites of optical and x - ray variability in pms stars are not  for the vast majority of stars in our study sample  instantaneously one and the same .",
    "surface accretion shocks and cool magnetic spots are evidently not the exclusive or dominant sites of x - ray production in most pms stars .",
