    "mixed - spin ising models have been studied for some time as simple models of ferrimagnets , and there has been renewed interest recently in connection with compensation points. these are temperatures , below the critical temperature , at which the sublattice magnetizations cancel exactly , giving zero total moment . as the temperature is tuned through such a point the total magnetization changes sign , which may be used in technological applications . in this context",
    ", ising models may be exactly solvable in special cases @xcite or they may be studied by a variety of powerful approaches , including monte carlo @xcite or other @xcite methods . in the present work",
    "we revisit one of the simplest such models , a mixed ",

    "the convention simply amounts to a rescaling of the exchange coupling .",
    "note that the nearest neighbour coupling @xmath1 may be either antiferromagnetic , @xmath5 , as assumed often for ferrimagnets , or ferromagnetic , @xmath6 .",
    "both cases are completely equivalent by a simple spin reversal on either sublattice .",
    "we shall use in this article ferromagnetic couplings . as a consequence , in our case the magnetizations of both sublattices are identical at the compensation point , while in the antiferromagnetic case , at the same compensation point , the sublattice magnetizations have equal magnitude but different sign leading to the above mentioned vanishing of the total magnetization .",
    "the model on the square lattice has been studied by several authors .",
    "kaneyoshi and chen @xcite , via a mean - field treatment , found a line of compensation points in a narrow region @xmath7",

    "buendia and novotny @xcite , using transfer matrix methods , supplemented by monte carlo simulations , found no evidence of either a compensation point or a tricritical point , although a compensation point was observed in an extended model with additional ferromagnetic interactions between @xmath10 spins .",
    "more recently , oitmaa and enting @xcite studied the same model using a combination of high- and low - temperature series . no compensation point was found , but evidence for a first - order transition , and hence a tricritical point was observed from an apparent crossing of the high- and low - temperature branches of the free energy with different slopes , for @xmath11 .",
    "thus the phase diagram of this simple model remained uncertain , motivating partly the present extensive monte carlo study , improving previous simulations substantially .",
    "in fact , our study provides clear evidence that the model in two dimensions has no compensation point or tricritical point .",
    "moreover , the model is found to exhibit very interesting thermal behaviour , both for the specific heat and the magnetization , especially in the low  temperature region near @xmath12 , which has not been discussed in detail before .",

    "in section 3 we consider the simple  cubic lattice . here , in contrast to the two  dimensional case , we find a clear occurrence of a line of compensation points .",

    "this leads to a lower , but still macroscopic degeneracy . at @xmath42 ,",

    "it is interesting to note that the height of the pronounced non ",
    "critical peak , signalling the partial disordering of the b sublattice , depends only very weakly on @xmath34 . in the range @xmath52 , one has @xmath53 .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "3b for @xmath49 , the critical peak , located at @xmath54 , may separate from the upper maximum , at @xmath55 , when increasing the strength of the single  ion term .",
    "thus , the specific heat may display a three  peak structure , with two non  critical maxima and a critical peak in between .",
    "the origin of the maximum at @xmath55 is due to the fact that at the critical point , the @xmath10 spins on the a sublattice form rather large clusters of different orientations , leading to the vanishing of the order parameter . that behaviour may be seen by monitoring typical equilibrium configurations .",
    "these clusters shrink quickly near @xmath55 , due to thermally activated flipping of @xmath10 spins , determined by the coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , @xmath55 is essentially independent of @xmath56 . as seen in fig .",
    "3b , the maximum in @xmath16 at @xmath55 depends rather weakly on the size of the lattice , @xmath13 , demonstrating its non  critical character .",
    "the height of the critical maximum at @xmath54 is expected , for ising universality , to increase logarithmically with @xmath13 for sufficiently large values of @xmath13 .",
    "our results are consistent with this expectation . however , on approach to the degeneracy point , the background contribution to the specific heat becomes more and more relevant .",
    "then larger and larger lattices , with @xmath57 , are needed to see the anticipated logarithmic behaviour .",
    "for example , at @xmath58 , one gets @xmath59 , and @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",

    "in contrast , the magnetization of the a sublattice , @xmath21 , is hardly affected by the disordering of the b sublattice .",

    "a high , but reduced degeneracy prevails , with all b spins being zero , and the a spins pointing randomly up or down.    for @xmath34 small or negative , a continuous transition of ising type is expected to occur , as we confirm in simulations with moderate efforts .",
    "most of our work has been done for @xmath87 , to identify possible deviations from that kind of transition .",
    "indeed , significant deviations from ising universality have been observed for @xmath88 , while for smaller values of @xmath34 the simulational data are consistent with an ising  like transition .",

    "our simulational findings confirm this scenario . as in the case of the square lattice , upon increasing @xmath34 , one encounters , eventually , three maxima in @xmath45 , see fig . 8 . in complete analogy to the two  dimensional case , the peak at the lower temperature , @xmath48 , is rather sharp and depends only very weakly on lattice size .",
    "it signals the partial disordering of the b sublattice , with b spins being flipped thermally from the ferromagnetic ( + or @xmath36 ) state to 0 .",
    "the maximum occurs at @xmath93 .",

    "accurate monte carlo data with a fine temperature resolution are required , due to the rather large nonanalytic background term in @xmath16 and the sharpness of the peak .",

    "as may be inferred from that figure , the sublattice magnetization at the compensation point decreases monotonically with decreasing single  ion term .",
    "therefore , when the compensation occurs at low magnetizations , the accurate location of the compensation point is difficult , because of strong finite  size effects in the critical region .",
    "on the other hand , with increasing @xmath34 , the compensation point moves towards lower temperatures , and finite size effects play usually no significant role . in any event , in contrast to the two  dimensional case , we find a line of compensation points for the simple  cubic lattice .",

    "both anomalies may cause difficulties in low and high  temperature expansions , which have predicted , incorrectly , the existence of a tricritical point .",
    "the suggestion on the absence of a compensation point has been confirmed , albeit the magnetization on the s=1 sublattice decreases rapidly near the anomaly of the specific heat at low temperatures .    in the case of the simple  cubic lattice ,",
    "the specific heat displays a similar three  peak structure , with two non  critical maxima and the critical peak in between . sufficiently far away from the degeneracy point , the ferromagnetic phase disorders via a continuous , ising  like transition . in the vicinity of the degeneracy point , @xmath85",
    ", this transition seems to be of first order .",
    "the evidence for that kind of transition is mainly based on the type of the histograms of the magnetization , showing phase coexistence .",
    "we tentatively locate the tricritical point at @xmath115 .",
    "in addition , we determined a line of compensation points , arising from the degeneracy point .",
    "thus , in three dimensions , the mean  field theory appears to give at least qualitatively correct predictions .",
    "however , in two dimensions the mean  field theory is found to be incorrect , even qualitatively .",
    "w.s . thanks the school of physics at the university of new south wales for the very kind hospitality during his stay there , which was supported by the gordon godfrey fund .",
