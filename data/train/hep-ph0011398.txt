    "it has been conjectured recently @xcite that the pomeron instead of being an infinite gluon ladder @xcite may appear as a finite sum of gluon ladders corresponding to a finite sum of regge multipoles with increasing multiplicities .",
    "the first term in the @xmath9 series contributes to the total cross - section with a constant term and can be associated with a simple pole , the second one ( double pole ) goes as @xmath9 , the third one ( triple pole ) as @xmath10 , etc .",
    "all pomeron poles have unit intercepts .",
    "a new prong opens each time the available energy exceeds the threshold value .",
    "the values of threshold parameter were found @xcite from a fit to the experimental data .",
    "another important set of parameters is related to the coupling of the gluons to hadrons , giving the relative weight of various diagrams . in ref .",
    "@xcite they were fitted to the forward scattering data and subsequently they were also calculated in qcd .",
    "below we study this problem both in the forward and non - forward directions .",
    "because of its complexity , we do not consider here the effect of the progressively opening channels as it was done in ref .",
    "instead we first consider a model with a simple and dipole pomeron [ dp ] contribution used earlier to fit elastic hadron scattering @xcite , low-@xmath11 structure functions @xcite and photoproduction of vector mesons at hera @xcite .",
    "the dp ansatz reads @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; @xmath15@xmath16 ; @xmath17@xmath18 .",
    "apart from the normalization factor @xmath19 , this model contains 4 adjustable parameters : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , moreover their number can be still reduced within the cone region ( i.e. @xmath24 @xmath25 by setting @xmath26 ) . here a linear pomeron trajectory , @xmath27 is implied .",
    "generalization to include nonlinear trajectory is straightforward .",
    "the model is strongly constrained by an integral relation between the residue at the simple and double poles @xcite , that produces the observed dip - bump structure in the differential cross - section in accordance with the experimental data .",
    ".5 cm    ' '' ''    .5 cm    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    the dipole pomeron model with a unit pomeron intercept @xcite was used to describe successfully @xmath0 and @xmath1 elastic scattering at the isr and the collider energies , however the ratio @xmath31 was found @xcite to decrease asymptotically for all physical values of the parameters . to obtain an increasing function for this ratio the authors of @xcite introduced a factor corresponding to the supercritical pomeron behavior @xcite .",
    "however in this case the unitarity is broken .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the unitarity violation occurs at energies only slightly above the tevatron energy of 1.8 tev , and therefore it is a problem of the present and not of the future . to avoid this problem",
    ", we consider a model containing a finite series of pomeron terms up to @xmath10 , in accordance with the unitarity constrains .",
    "our ansatz for the scattering amplitude is : @xmath32 where we introduce a tripole contribution to the dp in the simplest way ( see also @xcite ) :    @xmath33 e^{\\alpha'bt } e^ { \\left(\\alpha_{p}(t)-1\\right ) \\ln(-\\frac{is}{s_0})}.\\ ] ]    the pomeron trajectory : @xmath34 where the two - pion threshold @xmath35 .    in ( 2 )",

    "in order to determine the parameters that control the s - dependence of @xmath43 in a wide energy range @xmath44 , we used the available data for total cross sections @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a total of 66 experimental data has been included for @xmath45 .",
    "for the differential cross sections we selected the data at the energies @xmath46 ( for @xmath0scattering ) and @xmath47 ( for @xmath1scattering ) .",
    "the squared 4-momentum has been limited by @xmath48 , because at larger @xmath49 the influence of the dip region becomes visible ( in particular , it can be seen quite clearly at the collider energy @xmath50 ) .",
    "the total of 729 experimental points have been used in the overall fit .",
    "the resulting fits for @xmath52 , @xmath53 are shown in figs . 1 - 3 with the values of the fitted parameters quoted in table 1 .",
    "from these figures we conclude that the multipole pomeron model corresponding to a sum of gluon ladders up to two rungs fits the data perfectly well in a wide energy region within the diffraction cone . as result",
    ", the model gives a good behavior for the ratio @xmath31 for @xmath1scattering ( see fig .",
    "the rapid decrease of the coefficients of the first three terms ( approximately as @xmath54 ) in the pomeron series in ( 3 ) provides the fast convergence of the series and ensures the applicability of this approximation at still much higher energies .            on the one hand , though we used just a simplified t - dependence in the model reasonably good results were obtained . because the slopes of secondary reggeons do not influence the fit sufficiently , we have fixed them at @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath56 , which correspond to the values of chew - frautschi plot . on the other hand",
    ", we included the curvature of the pomeron trajectory that can not be negligible .",
    "it should be also taken into account that the calculated slope of the pomeron value is close to the generally accepted value @xmath58 @xmath56 .    the quality of our fits @xmath59 has not reached the best fit @xmath60 obtained in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we believe this difference can be significantly reduced after adding the data of coulomb interference region @xmath61 to the global fit .    *",
