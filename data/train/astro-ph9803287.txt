    "spatial distribution of gravitational mass around elliptical galaxies has been estimated from radial distribution of x - ray emitting hot interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the outermost radius of the ism distribution has so far remained undetermined due to a lack of sensitivity . as a result",
    ", the total gravitating masses of elliptical galaxies depend heavily on the assumed overall extent of the ism .",
    "high sensitivity x - ray observations of bright galaxies are therefore important in determing the mass distribution in these systems .",
    "ngc  4636 is one of the nearest giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "we employ a distance of 17 mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "diffuse thermal x - rays from its ism make it one of the x - ray brightest elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) except those located at the center of clusters . although ngc  4636 is located in the virgo southern extension ( @xcite ) , it is apparently clear of the large - scale x - ray emission from hot intra - cluster gas associated with the virgo cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "trinchieri et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , using _",
    ", detected a largely extended x - ray emission up to 18@xmath4 from ngc  4636 , and suggested it to be an extension of the virgo cluster emission . here , we present new results on the extended x - ray emission around ngc  4636 based on a very long observation towards the galaxy center and on an offset observation from asca .",
    "spectral properties of ngc  4636 have been already reported by matsushita et al .",
    "we observed ngc  4636 in the 0.510 kev x - rays twice with the _ asca _ observatory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first observation , performed for 40 ksec in 1993 july 22 , was already analyzed by several authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the second observation was conducted from 1995 december 28 through 1996 january 4 , resulting in an exceptionally long exposure for 200 ksec .",
    "we also employ _ asca _ data taken on 1994 june 15 , in the field of ngc  4643 , which is just to the south of ngc  4636 .",
    "figure 1 shows background - subtracted 0.72.0 kev x - ray images of the ngc  4636 field and the south - offset field , taken with the gis ( gas imaging spectrometer ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this energy band is dominated by the ism emission .",
    "in addition to the bright emission peaked at ngc  4636 , a fainter emission spreads over the entire gis field of @xmath5 radius , and even to the south - offset field @xmath6 ( @xmath7 kpc ) away .",
    "the extended emission looks azimuthally symmetric around ngc  4636 , without significant brightening toward the virgo center ( to the north ) ; along a circle of a radius @xmath8 centered on ngc  4636 , the brightness is constant to within 30% .",
    "furthermore , _ ginga _ showed an upper limit on the diffuse x - ray intensity at @xmath9 north of ngc  4636 ( @xcite ) to be 10 times lower than that observed in fig .  1 at the edge of the ngc  4636 field .",
    "we therefore conclude that the extended emission is associated with ngc  4636 rather than the virgo cluster .",
    "we derived radial profile of x - ray surface brightness , as shown in fig .  2 , by azimuthally averaging the intensity in the 0.72.0 kev energy range around ngc  4636 .",
    "the two bright background sources in the north of ngc  4636 were excluded , while effects of fainter background sources are negligible ( @xmath10% ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the discontinuity of the profile at @xmath5 , corresponding to the field boundary , is caused by the vignetting and stray light of the asca x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . as shown in table 1 ( the last column ) , the fraction of stray light from the ngc  4636 field to the south offset field is about 47% and 42% at @xmath11 and at @xmath12 respectively , where @xmath13 is the radius measured from ngc  4636 .",
    "if we limit the region to @xmath14 , the scattered light from the @xmath15 and @xmath16 field amounts to 64% and 80% of the detected photons , respectively .",
    "as shown later , we conclude from the brightness profile in fig .  2 that the x - ray emission is significant until @xmath17 ( 300 kpc ) from ngc 4636 .",
    "we fit the radial x - ray profile with @xmath18 models convolved with the instrumental response of _ asca_. the @xmath18 model describes projected x - ray surface brightness @xmath19 as @xmath20 , where @xmath13 is the projected radius , while @xmath21 ( the core radius ) , @xmath22 , and @xmath18 are parameters ( e.g.  sarazin 1988 ) . based on the previous _ einstein _ results ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , we fixed @xmath21 to @xmath23 which is practically unresolved with _ asca_. as shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "the data within @xmath24 ( @xmath25 kpc ) can be approximated well by the @xmath26 model , which behaves essentially as @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast , the data start deviating from the model beyond @xmath28 .",
    "these properties agree very well with the _ rosat _ radial x - ray profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , the observed radial x - ray profile can not be fitted with a single @xmath18-model .",
    "we accordingly fitted the radial profile with a sum of two @xmath18 models , a compact and an extended ones , both centered on ngc  4636 . except for the core radius of the compact one",
    ", the two components were allowed to have free parameters .",
    "the radial extent of the extended component was examined by changing a cut - off radius , and models with its value less than @xmath29 predicts too little flux at @xmath30 with the reduced @xmath31 for 64 dof .. when we assumed the cut - off radius to be 60 and 150 , the reduced @xmath32 decrease to 1.34 and 1.12 , respectively .",
    "this shows that the x - ray emission is significant to 60 from ngc 4636 .",
    "we assumed the cut - off radius to be 150 in the later analysis .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the double @xmath18 model with this cut - off radius can fit the observed profile .",
    "the @xmath18 values are 0.60 ( 0.570.63 ) and 0.40 ( 0.380.42 ) for the compact and extended components respectively , and @xmath33 of the extended component is @xmath34 or 30 ( 2040 ) kpc .",
    "the two @xmath18 components cross over at @xmath35 ( @xmath36 kpc ) .",
    "since we can exclude a flat profile for the wider component , it is certain that the extended emission is localized in the region surrounding ngc  4636 . when integrated up to @xmath37 , the 0.54 kev luminosity carried by the extended @xmath18 component becomes @xmath38 ergs s@xmath39 , which exceeds that of the compact @xmath18 component by a factor of 5 .      in order to study temperature distribution of the gas",
    ", we accumulated the gis data in concentric annular regions as summarized in table 1 .",
    "then we can obtain a projected ( not a three - dimensional ) temperature profile .",
    "spectral fit is carried out with the r - s model with photoelectric absorption . to represent the contribution from low - mass x - ray binaries in ngc  4636 ( matsushita et al .",
    "1994 ) , we added a thermal bremsstrahlung with a temperature fixed at 10 kev . since gis data can not constrain hydrogen column density ( @xmath40 ) accurately , we fixed the value to those determined by the sis in matsushita et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in the same way as in matsushita",
    "et al.(1997 ) , the abundances of heavy elements are represented by two parameters , one for the @xmath41-elements ( o , ne , mg , si , and s ) and the other for the fe ( fe and ni ) group , which are denoted as @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively . at each radius",
    "we fixed @xmath42 to the best fit value derived by matsushita et al.(1997 ) , and left @xmath44 free .",
    "beyond @xmath45 , we fixed @xmath42 to 0.37 solar as derived for @xmath46 by matsushita et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , because the field of view of the sis does not cover this region and no good information is available .",
    "acceptable fits have been obtained , and the results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the spectral fits indicate that the gas is approximately isothermal , but there is a small positive temperature gradient , from 0.7 to 0.8 kev , from the center to @xmath47 , and beyond which the temperature drops to 0.5 kev at the south - offset field ( @xmath48 ) ( table 1 ) .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "data show steeper gradient within several arcminutes from the center , probably because of the higher angular resolution .",
    "this `` ring - sorted analysis '' is however affected by the spectral mixing effect among different sky regions , due to the extended point spread function ( psf ) of the xrt as well as the projection effect .",
    "the psf tends to smear out a radial gradient in the ism properties .",
    "fraction of leakage photons from other annular regions into each ring estimated from the observed brightness distribution is about 50% ( 2nd column from the right in table 1 ) for @xmath49 .",
    "the total mass @xmath50 within a 3-dimensional radius @xmath51 , assuming a hydrostatic equilibrium and a spherical symmetry , is given by ( e.g @xcite ) , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the proton mass , @xmath54 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath55 is the constant of gravity , and @xmath56 is the mean particle mass in unit of @xmath53 .    to estimate the radial profile of the total mass , we analytically deproject the two @xmath18-model components in fig .  2 back to 3 dimensions individually , and obtain emissivities of the compact and extended components , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "we then calculate the ism density profile as the sum of the two components ; @xmath59 , with @xmath60 denoting the emissivity function for a temperature @xmath61 and metal abundance @xmath62 .",
    "we assume the two components to have the same temperature .",
    "based on the projected temperature and abundance profiles as shown in table 1 , we approximate the 3-dimensional profiles for temperature by @xmath63 kev with @xmath64 kpc ( @xcite ) , and for the abundance profile by @xmath65 solar with @xmath66 kpc ( @xcite ) . the observed temperature drop beyond 50 kpc",
    "is modeled as @xmath67 kev with @xmath68 kpc and @xmath69 kpc .",
    "these approximation are confirmed to reproduce the observed projected profiles very well .    the derived total mass of ngc  4636 is presented in fig .  3 , together with the ism mass profile ( obtained by integrating @xmath70 ) and the stellar mass profile assuming the @xmath71-law ( de vaucoulers 1948 ) with assuming @xmath72 ( mass - to - light ratio ) of stars to be 8 .",
    "we also show the result for a constant temperature ( 0.80 kev ) and abundance ( 1.0 solar ) in fig .",
    "3 . the total mass @xmath50 increases",
    "roughly as @xmath73 up to @xmath74 kpc , and then it once flattens at @xmath75 , producing a shoulder - like structure at @xmath76 kpc . then @xmath50 starts increasing again beyond @xmath77 kpc .",
    "this is essentially the same feature as seen in the fornax cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and a1795 ( @xcite ) . at @xmath78 kpc",
    ", @xmath50 reaches @xmath79 .",
    "the step - like feature in the gravitational mass profile derived in the previous section may depend on the particular choice of the double-@xmath18 model .",
    "we need to examine if other mass profiles are consistent with the observed brightness profile .",
    "to answer this question , we estimate the total mass without assuming the double-@xmath18 model . for simplicity , we assume an isothermal gas distribution since variation of emissivity with the gas temperature in the range 0.5@xmath30.8 kev is less than 20% , and effects of temperature and abundance gradients on the total mass were found to be relatively small . from fig .  2",
    ", we can safely assume that beyond 20@xmath4 and within @xmath80 , the radial brightness is dominated by a single @xmath18 component with @xmath81 and @xmath82 with @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "these features are consistent with the _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ results .",
    "therefore , in the regions @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we assume that the gravitational mass profile is same as that from the double-@xmath18 analysis . then",
    ", our task is to find the mass profile which can smoothly connect the two regions .",
    "we searched for the mass profile in the @xmath86 range which can produce the observed brightness profile by means of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we divided the radius into @xmath70 ( @xmath87 and 16 ) equal intervals in a logarithmic scale and assumed that @xmath88 is constant within each step .",
    "we randomly picked up a value of @xmath89   between @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 times for each of the @xmath70 radial intervals . in the actual analysis , we extended the mass profile to @xmath84 with the same @xmath89 value at @xmath93 .",
    "for each trial mass curve , we compare the implied brightness profile with the observed one through @xmath32 fits . we take only acceptable results at 90% confidence limits . after a number of trials ,",
    "153 acceptable mass curves have been obtained .",
    "the envelope of these curves , is plotted in fig .  3 , which would represent the acceptable range of the gravitational mass from this model independent analysis .",
    "we note that @xmath50 for the best fit double-@xmath18 model lies within the envelope of model - independent estimation .",
    "although the uncertainty of @xmath50 became larger than that of double-@xmath18 modeling , variation of @xmath50 holds some similarity .",
    "the growth rate of @xmath50 drops at @xmath94 kpc , and starts increasing again in the outer region .",
    "asca observations have shown a very extended x - ray emission with a radius of at least @xmath17 ( 300 kpc ) surrounding ngc  4636 , which is much larger than that detected by _",
    "rosat_. we studied radial temperature and density distributions of the gas , and determined gravitational mass profile with and without assuming a double-@xmath18 model .    according to fig .  3",
    ", the gravitational halo of ngc  4636 appears to terminate once at @xmath95 kpc , where the total mass reaches several @xmath96 .",
    "this inner component probably corresponds to the mass associated with the galaxy ngc  4636 .",
    "then , the total mass starts increasing again , forming a halo - in - halo structure whose total size is comparable to that of a galaxy group . the mass of the whole system and its mass - to - light ratio at 300 kpc reach @xmath97 and @xmath7 , respectively , which are again comparable to those of galaxy groups ( @xcite ) .    at @xmath98 kpc ,",
    "the x - ray emitting plasma becomes the dominant form of baryons , with its mass reaching 58% of the total gravitating mass .",
    "this value is considerably higher than those of individual elliptical galaxies , and again close to those found in galaxy groups and poor clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "these features all support the presence of a gravitational potential with a size of a galaxy group around ngc  4636 .",
    "a further support is given by the observed abundance decrease in the x - ray emitting plasma ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , from @xmath99 solar within @xmath100 kpc , to @xmath101 solar beyond @xmath102 kpc to a is typical level of groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "nolthenius ( 1993 ) identified ngc  4636 as a member of virgo southern extension f cloud .",
    "however the 3-dimensional location of ngc  4636 is far offset from the center of the member galaxies in the cloud , and their velocity dispersion , 463 km s@xmath39 , is much larger than that inferred from the observed gas temperature .",
    "the diameter of the cloud , 1.26 mpc , is also much larger than the scale of the x - ray emission .",
    "therefore , the relation between the x - ray halo and the galaxy cloud remains unclear , but it is very likely that there is some galaxy concentration around ngc  4636 .",
    "extensive studies of asca data have revealed ( @xcite ) that x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies preferentially possess large - scale x - ray halos of a few 100 kpc scale , just like ngc  4636 .",
    "such a galaxy may be regarded as a dominant member of a galaxy group even though its evidence is scarce in the optical data .",
    "thus , the x - ray emitting plasma may provide a better tracer of the total mass distribution than the light emitting matter .",
    "we speculate that x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies may commonly possess such an extended emission with low surface brightness .",
    "x - ray luminosity of elliptical galaxies scatter by 2 orders of magnitude for the same optical luminosity , and its cause has long been a puzzle . the presence and absence of the extended emission",
    "can easily account for the large scatter in the total x - ray luminosity , and the low surface brightness of the extended emission , such as in ngc  4636 , explains the previous undetection .",
    "we hope that systematic deep exposures from asca will solve this problem and bring us a complete understanding of the mass distribution around elliptical galaxies .",
