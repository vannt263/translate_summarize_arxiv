    "the constituent quark models have long been used to investigate the structure of nucleon resonances .",
    "most of the earlier works@xcite were based on phenomenological forms of residual quark - quark ( @xmath7 ) interactions . with the development of quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) , a more fundamental approach was developed@xcite by assuming that the residual @xmath7 interactions can be parameterized as the fermi - breit form of one - gluon - exchange mechanism@xcite . in recent years",
    ", an alternative approach has been developed@xcite based on the assumption that the residual @xmath7-interaction is due to the exchange of octet goldstone bosons . with appropriate phenomenological tuning , both approaches can reproduce the general structure of the baryon spectra listed by particle data group ( pdg)@xcite .",
    "some attempts@xcite have also been made to develop hybrid models including both one - gluon - exchange and one - meson - exchange quark - quark interactions . to make progress , it is important to develop an approach to distinguish all of these constituent quark models using additional experimental data .    the main question we want to address in this work is how the constituent quark models can be tested against the @xmath0 scattering data .",
    "it is common to compare their predicted masses and decay widths with the data listed by pdg .",
    "all calculations of decay widths have been done@xcite perturbatively .",
    "for example , the width of the decay of @xmath8 into a @xmath0 state is calculated by evaluating the matrix element @xmath9 with an appropriate operator @xmath10 describing how pions are coupled to quarks .",
    "the interactions between the outgoing mesons and baryons are neglected .",
    "it has been found that such a perturbative calculation can at best describe the general qualitative trend of the data , but not the quantitative details .",
    "for example , the widths of @xmath11 predicted by ref.@xcite are ( @xmath12 ) mev@xmath13 , which do not seem in quantitative agreement with the empirical values ( @xmath14 ) mev@xmath13 determined in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is important to note here that the pdg s values are extracted from the experimental @xmath0 amplitudes which contain both resonant and non - resonant components . in most partial waves ,",
    "the non - resonant mechanisms are important ; one can see this from the fact that most of the resonances identified by pdg are in fact not visible in @xmath0 and @xmath15 cross section data . by the unitarity condition , therefore the extracted resonance parameters `` inherently '' contain non - resonant contributions .",
    "furthermore , the separation of non - resonant components from the full amplitudes is a model - dependent procedure .",
    "the available amplitude analyses@xcite have yielded very different resonance parameters in many cases .",
    "clearly , except in a region where the non - resonant contributions are negligibly small , the comparison of the pdg values ( or values from other amplitude analyses ) with the decay widths calculated perturbatively from the constituent quark models could be very misleading .",
    "in particular , a perturbative calculation of decay widths is obviously not valid for cases in which two nearby resonances in the same partial wave can couple with each other through their coupling with the meson - nucleon continuum .",
    "similar precautions must also be taken in comparing the predicted masses with the pdg values .",
    "these issues concerning the comparison of the pdg data with the predictions from constituent quark models were discussed in ref.@xcite .    to have a more direct test of constituent quark models",
    ", we will explore in this work a nonperturbative approach that takes account of the unitarity condition and can relate the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes directly to the predicted internal quark wave functions of baryons .",
    "our approach is guided by a dynamical model of @xmath0 and @xmath15 reactions developed in ref.@xcite ( sl model ) .",
    "it was shown there that the @xmath0 and @xmath15 reactions up to the @xmath16 energy region can be described by the following hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 describes the @xmath19 transitions , and @xmath20 are the non - resonant interactions .",
    "it was found that the unitarity condition and the non - resonant interaction @xmath20 can shift the mass of @xmath21 by about 60 mev and account for as much as about 40 @xmath22 of the m1 strength of the @xmath23 decay .",
    "this provides an explanation of a long - standing discrepancy between the m1 value predicted by the constituent quark model and the pdg value .",
    "it is therefore natural to conjecture that @xmath24 of eq .",
    "( [ slham ] ) can be identified with the model hamiltonian of a constituent quark model , and @xmath18 correspond to the decay amplitudes calculated perturbatively using the resulting baryon wave functions .",
    "this assumption is then similar to what was used in a dynamical study@xcite of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude in @xmath6 channel within a constituent quark model .",
    "however , ref.@xcite did not consider the non - resonant interaction @xmath20 and employed very simple internal wave functions for the @xmath25 states . in this work",
    ", we will extend the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ slham ] ) to consider the multi - channel and multi - resonance cases . as a first step",
    ", we will focus on the @xmath6 channel .",
    "we will concentrate on analyzing the dynamical content of our approach in this rather complex channel .",
    "there have been some attempts to understand the constituent quark models within qcd .",
    "manohar and georgi@xcite argued that in the kinematic region between the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath26 gev and the qcd confinement scale @xmath27 gev , the effective theory for hadrons is defined by the lagrangian @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the constituent quark mass , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the fields for constituent quarks , gluons , and goldstone bosons , respectively .",
    "the most crucial dynamical assumption of this approach is that the goldstone bosons are coupled directly to the constituent quarks by the flavor su(3 ) symmetry characterized by the coupling constant @xmath33 .",
    "this is consistent with the notion that the goldstone bosons result from the spontaneously breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry that characterizes the qcd lagrangian .",
    "the lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ qcdl ] ) implies that the constituent quarks could interact with each other through both the exchanges of gluons and goldstone bosons .",
    "the usual one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) and one - meson - exchange ( ome ) @xmath7-interaction can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ qcdl ] ) using perturbation theory .",
    "this conjecture is supported by a recent lattice qcd calculation@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was found that the mass splitting between @xmath34 and @xmath21 is largely due to the meson - exchange mechanism .",
    "the need of both flavor - independent ( i.e. oge ) and flavor - dependent ( i.e. ome ) @xmath7-interactions is also suggested by the baryon mass formula determined in an algebraic approach@xcite . in this work",
    ", we will take this point of view and will consider a general constituent quark model which can have both oge and ome mechanisms .",
    "this model can be reduced to the previously developed oge or ome models in some limits .",
    "the meson - quark couplings were also included in other hadron models such as the chiral / cloudy bag models@xcite . however the lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ qcdl ] ) with @xmath35 mev for up and down quarks is closest to a framework within which one can hope to understand the dynamical origins of the most often used constituent quark models based on @xmath7-potentials .",
    "perhaps one can apply the dynamical approach developed in this work to also examine other hadron models .",
    "but this is beyond the scope of this paper .    in section",
    "ii , we present the model hamiltonian for baryons and our method for solving the three - quark bound state problem",

    "in this exploratory study , we take the simplest , but often used , approach and assume that the baryon structure can be described in terms of three nonrelativistic constituent quarks .",
    "the model hamiltonian is of the following familiar form @xmath36 the kinetic energy @xmath37 is defined by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the momentum of the @xmath40th quark and @xmath41 is the center of mass momentum of the three - quark system .",

    ", we drop its spin - orbit component and retain only spin - spin and tensor components .",

    "( [ ogess])-([oget ] ) , we have introduced a form factor of the form @xmath62 to regularize the interactions at short distances .",

    "if the potentials are not regularized by form factors , the ground state energy is not bound from below .",
    "since we only consider baryons with strangeness @xmath64 , the ome model is defined only by the exchange of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "because @xmath3 is isospin singlet , it only contributes to the isospin independent parts of the potential . on the other hand",
    ", the exchange of the isovector pion leads to isospin dependent terms .",

    "if we assume that the @xmath69 vertex function can be calculated from the @xmath70 interaction ( as defined later in section iii ) , the @xmath2-quark coupling constant @xmath71 can be related to the @xmath69 coupling constant . within the naive @xmath42 configuration for the nucleon",

    "near the @xmath189 production threshold , where @xmath243 is expected to dominate the cross section , both the oge and phenomenological models explain the data well , while the results from the ome model are too small due to the weak coupling of its @xmath243 to the @xmath189 channel .",
    "the phenomenological model seems to give the best description of @xmath339 the @xmath0 amplitudes and the @xmath3 production cross sections .",
    "the discrepancy with the data at higher energies in fig .",
    "[ fig25 ] is mainly due to the neglect of non-@xmath6 partial waves .",
    "our results in this section suggest that the residual @xmath7-interactions within the constituent quark model are much more complicated than the conventional oge and ome models . within the effective theory defined by the lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ qcdl ] ) , higher order exchanges of mesons and gluons must be considered .",
    "the phenomenological model we have obtained is very suggestive .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this model is also consistent with the data of other partial waves .",
    "we have developed a dynamical approach to predict @xmath0 scattering amplitudes starting with the constituent quark models .",
    "this is an extension of the dynamical model developed in ref.@xcite to account for the multi - channel and multi - resonance cases . in this exploratory investigation ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath0 amplitude in the @xmath6 channel and only consider the most frequently used nonrelativistic constituent quark models based on either the one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) or the one - meson - exchange ( ome ) quark - quark residual interactions .",
    "the first step of our calculations is to choose appropriate parameters of the considered constituent quark models to reproduce the bare parameters associated with the @xmath21 within the @xmath0 model developed in ref.@xcite . here",
    ", we apply a variational method to solve the three - quark bound state problem .",
    "the resulting wave functions are then used to calculate the @xmath1 vertex functions by assuming that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons couple directly to quarks .",
    "these vertex functions and the predicted baryon bare masses then define a hamiltonian for @xmath0 reactions .",
    "we apply the unitary transformation method of ref.@xcite to solve the @xmath0 scattering problem .",
    "the final parameters of the considered constituent quark models are determined by fitting the @xmath0 scattering data .",
    "we have found that both the oge and ome models can reproduce the @xmath6 scattering amplitudes only up to about @xmath340 1500 mev .",
    "the oge model is better in reproducing the rapid change in @xmath0 phase near the @xmath3 production threshold , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] . however , both models fail to describe the data at higher energies",
    ". the dynamical origins of the difficulties are found to be due to the sensitivities of the predicted @xmath341 vertex functions to the structure of the assumed residual quark - quark interactions . in particular , it is found that the flavor dependent ( @xmath342 ) tensor component of the ome model does not seem to be favored by the data . on the other hand , the oge model can describe the data better if its spin - spin interaction includes a flavor dependent factor . to illustrate this , we have shown that the data can be reasonably well described ( figs .",
    "[ fig22]-[fig23 ] ) by a phenomenological model which has a spin - spin interaction from the ome model and a tensor interaction from the oge model .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results indicate that the residual quark - quark interactions within the nonrelativistic constituent quark model could be much more complicated than the simple oge and ome mechanisms . in the future",
    ", we need to consider relativistic effects and the residual quark - quark interactions due to multi - gluon and/or multi - meson exchanges .",
    "in addition , we need to investigate the two - body effects on the calculations of @xmath343 vertex functions . our investigations in these directions will be published elsewhere .",
