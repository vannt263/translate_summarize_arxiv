    "more than 540 exoplanets have been discovered so far .",
    "dedicated planet surveys have revealed the diversity of giant planets outside the solar system .",
    "many sun - like stars are known to harbor close - in giant planets called hot - jupiters , in contrast to our sun .",
    "recently , direct imaging has shed light on the existence of distant extrasolar giant planets such as hr8799b , c , d , e @xcite , fomalhaut b @xcite , and beta pic b @xcite .",
    "a large number of exoplanets enable us to consider planet formation around various types of star through a statistical approach , which is often called population synthesis . in the population synthesis ,",
    "planetary systems are built by putting together pieces of formation processes ( e.g. , solid and gas accretion , planetary migration and so on ) in a monte - carlo way .",
    "nowadays several groups have worked on the population synthesis independently ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "those population - synthesis studies succeed in reproducing the planetary mass - period distribution of detected extrasolar giant planets .",
    "this indicates that our basic picture of planetary formation is supported by observed exoplanets . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also true that different population syntheses based on different assumptions as to planetary accretion and disc properties reproduce the same observed distribution .",
    "this highlights the need to understand underlying formation processes of giant planets more exactly .",
    "the core - accretion model is one of the promising models for giant planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model ,",
    "once a core reaches a critical core mass through planetesimal accretion , runaway gas accretion is triggered and the envelope mass increases rapidly .",
    "the typical value of the critical core mass is thought of as being @xmath0 @xcite to form a massive envelope within the disc lifetime suggested by observations @xcite .",
    "this is , however , incompatible with the inferred mass of jupiter s core of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the critical core mass depends on planetesimal accretion rate and opacities in the envelope @xcite",
    ". fast accretion of planetesimals leads to form gas giants with large cores .",
    "although slow rates of planetesimal accretion lead to smaller critical cores of @xmath2 , gas accretion on to small cores tends to be long .",
    "reduction of grain opacities in the envelope can not only lower critical core masses but also hasten gas accretion on to the protoplanet @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that core masses needed to form massive envelopes before disc dissipation are as small as @xmath3 in the extreme case of grain - free envelopes .",
    "in fact , recent calculations on the dynamical behaviour of dust grains in the accreting envelope demonstrate that grain opacities in the envelope can be reduced to be on average 1% or less of those in the protoplanetary disc @xcite .",
    "the reason is that small grains initially suspended in the outer envelope quickly grow large in size and then settle down into the deep envelope where temperature is high enough so that grains evaporate .",
    "their results support that reduction of grain opacities can be a feasible idea that relaxes the problem of the formation of gas giants with small cores .",
    "another factor that affects the critical core mass is considered in this paper .",
    "all the previous studies assumed that the composition of gas is solar throughout the envelope .",
    "in fact , the envelope is likely to be polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals .",
    "once a protoplanet grows up to be mars - size , it becomes difficult for the protoplanet to capture planetesimals because the protoplanet enhances their random velocities through gravitational scatterings by itself . on the other hand , disruptive collisions between planetesimals with high relative velocities take place frequently and yield a large number of 10 to 100 m - sized fragments unless the planetesimals are larger than 100  km @xcite .",
    "the protoplanet can capture such small - sized fragments because of the enhanced collisional cross - section between the envelope and those fragments due to gas drag @xcite .",
    "the fragments going through the envelope experience both melting and evaporation and lose most of their masses in the deep envelope before reaching the core @xcite . as a result",
    ", envelope pollution by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals occurs inevitably in the course of planetary accretion .",
    "in addition , evaporation ( or erosion ) of the core itself is also expected to occur , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "this fact motivates us to consider giant planet formation taking into account the effects of the heavy - element enrichment in the envelope .",
    "approximate solutions for the critical core mass analytically derived by previous studies tell that envelope pollution has significant impacts on the critical core mass :    * wholly - radiative envelopes @xcite : @xmath4 * wholly convective envelopes @xcite : @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the critical core mass , @xmath7 the molecular weight , @xmath8 the rosseland mean opacity , @xmath9 the planetesimal accretion rate , and @xmath10 the adiabatic exponent .",
    "the subscript `` out '' means the value at the outer edge of the envelope .",
    "the envelope pollution causes increase in @xmath7 and reduction of @xmath11 ( or reduction of @xmath10 ) .",
    "the reduction of @xmath11 comes from dissociations of several kinds of molecules .",
    "the two formulae indicate that both effects reduce the critical core mass .",
    "this is because those effects lead to reduction of the local pressure gradient that supports the gravity .",
    "on the other hand , the envelope pollution also causes rise in gas opacities as a negative effect .",
    "the rise in gas opacities , mainly @xmath12 that absorbs infrared radiation , increases the critical core mass by increasing the temperature gradient that results in an increase in the pressure gradient .    in this study , we show that envelope pollution by icy planetesimals lowers critical core masses in most cases and hastens gas accretion on to the protoplanet despite the rise in gas opacities .",
    "we present numerical procedures in section 2 , including our modelling for envelope pollution by icy planetesimals .",
    "results of critical core masses and gas accretion time - scales are shown in section 3 and section 4 , respectively .",
    "discussions and conclusion are in the last two sections .",
    "we suppose a spherically - symmetric protoplanet that consists of a gaseous envelope and a rigid core with a constant density of @xmath13 . the envelope is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "its structure is simulated with a set of the following basic equations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that includes the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath14 the equation of mass conservation , @xmath15 the equation of heat transfer , @xmath16 and the equation of energy conservation , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass interior to radius @xmath19 , @xmath20 the pressure , @xmath21 the temperature , @xmath22 the density , @xmath23 the specific entropy , @xmath24 the energy flux crossing at a sphere of radius @xmath19 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 the gravitational constant , @xmath27 the specific energy generation by planetesimal accretion , and @xmath28 the time .",
    "the dominant mechanism of heat transfer is chosen by the schwartzschild criterion for convective instability :    @xmath29    where @xmath11 is the adiabatic temperature gradient and @xmath30 the radiative temperature gradient given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the velocity of light , @xmath33 the radiation density constant , and @xmath8 the rosseland mean opacity .",
    "opacities both of dust grains and gas and the equation of state for gaseous components that we use are mentioned in section  [ sec.2 - 2 ] .",
    "the boundary conditions are given at the core surface and the outer edge of the envelope as follows :    @xmath34    and @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the core mass and density , respectively , @xmath38 the luminosity at the core surface , @xmath39 the protoplanet s total mass , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the density and temperature of the disc gas , respectively .",
    "the total mass of the planet , @xmath39 , is the mass of gas contained inside the outer edge of the envelope , which is defined by the smaller of the bondi radius ( @xmath42 ) and the hill radius ( @xmath43 ) : @xmath44^{1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the sound velocity , @xmath46 the semimajor axis of the protoplanet , and @xmath47 the mass of the central star . in this paper , we use @xmath48 , unless otherwise noted .",
    "we assume that the energy release by planetesimals occurs in a narrow region on top of the core ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) .",
    "this assumption seems to be incompatible with the situation that planetesimals evaporate and deposit their kinetic energy before reaching the core .",
    "however , such simplification affects the results little , because the energy deposition of planetesimals occurs mostly in the deep , convective envelope , the structure of which is insensitive to where energy deposition occurs inside itself .",
    "on the other hand , we neglect the effect of sinking of dissolved materials of icy planetesimals in this study . gravitational potential energy released by sinking of ablated materials",
    "makes a contribution to slow down gas accretion on to a proto - gas giant as pointed out by @xcite . whether the energy release by sinking of ablated materials occurs effectively in a wide region where planetesimals slow down via ablation",
    "is important for formation time - scales of gas giants .",
    "it will be considered in future calculations based on trajectories of planetesimals through a protoplanet s envelope .      ) and the polluted ( @xmath50 ) layers , where @xmath51 and @xmath50 are the mass fractions of heavy elements for the disc gas and the mixture of the disc gas and icy planetesimals , respectively .",
    "the boundary between the upper and the lower layers is defined by the homopause temperature ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    in this study , we consider that the envelope consists of two components , materials of disc gas ( component a ) and those of icy planetesimals ( component b ) .",
    "the chemical compositions of component a and b are assumed to be solar and comet - halley - like , respectively .",
    "the mass fractions of hydrogen , helium , and the others in the solar abundances are @xmath53 , respectively @xcite , while those in comet halley are @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "we consider that the envelope has two - layer structure ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the upper layer consists only of component a because disc gas flows into the outer part of the envelope .",
    "the lower layer consists of component b in addition to a. the reason is as follows . while going through the envelope , planetesimals experience mass loss via strong ablation .",
    "most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope @xcite . in the lower envelope , convection occurs because of molecular dissociation and high gas opacity due to the bound - free absorption of hydrogen .",
    "the evaporated materials are thus stirred effectively by convection , so that the chemical composition becomes uniform in the lower layer of the envelope .",
    "such a boundary between convective and radiative regions ( i.e. , `` tropopause '' ) corresponds typically to a temperature of @xmath55 .",
    "however , the boundary is likely to be above the tropopause . even in radiative regions ,",
    "eddy diffusion carries the evaporated materials of icy planetesimals upward like in the homosphere extending above the tropopause on the present earth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also , pollution occurs even in the upper envelope because the temperature there is enough to evaporate ice . while only a small fraction of the mass of planetesimals evaporates in the upper envelope @xcite , the envelope is itself tenuous in such a region , so that the upper envelope can be also enriched in heavy elements .",
    "thus , we regard the boundary between the two layers as a free parameter in this study . to do so , we introduce `` homopause temperature '' , @xmath52 ; the values of @xmath52 that we use in this study are @xmath56 .",
    "thermodynamic quantities of the envelope gas are calculated under the assumption of chemical equilibrium . although chemical equilibrium may not be achieved in the region of low temperature because chemical reactions proceed slowly",
    ", this problem is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the following 13 constituents are considered , namely , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath12 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "thermodynamic quantities are calculated from the thermodynamic potentials .",
    "the relevant physical quantities are given in nist - janaf thermochemical tables @xcite .",
    "we determine the mass fractions of carbon ( @xmath69 ) and oxygen ( @xmath70 ) in the lower envelope in such a manner that the sum of the two fractions is equal to @xmath50 and the ratio is conserved : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the mixing ratio of component b. the mass fractions of hydrogen and helium in the mixture are described by @xmath72 as well : @xmath73 the ratio of @xmath74 to @xmath75 is @xmath76 , while that of @xmath77 to @xmath78 is @xmath79 . in this study , we deal with @xmath50 , which is equivalent to @xmath72 , as a free parameter for simplicity because the actual value of @xmath50 depends on various processes such as ablation efficiency of icy planetesimals and their entry velocities and should be determined in a complicated manner .",
    "the gas opacity is derived from opacity tables with different values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 given by j. ferguson @xcite .",
    "their calculations include other heavy elements besides @xmath82 .",
    "all the elements except @xmath57 and @xmath58 are assumed to be in the solar abundances .",
    "this is reasonable because the abundances of heavy elements in comet halley are known to be similar to the solar abundances @xcite .",
    "the opacity tables of @xcite are provided as a function of @xmath83 , where @xmath22 is the density in @xmath84 and @xmath85 the temperature in million k. if @xmath86 exceeds the available range of the opacity tables , namely , @xmath87 , we calculate the gas opacity by extrapolating the tabular data . even if the values at @xmath88 are used for @xmath87 without extrapolation , no significant difference in the critical core mass is found .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity of dust grains is calculated from the monochromatic opacities of dust grains in protoplanetary discs presented by @xcite .",
    "the dust constituents , their evaporation temperatures , and the size distribution of the dust grains used in @xcite are the same as those in @xcite , while their optical constants refer to @xcite .",
    "the difference between the grain opacities is nevertheless small @xcite .",
    "we introduce a factor , @xmath89 , that represents reduction or enhancement of the grain opacity , namely , grain opacities being @xmath89 times opacities of grains in disc gas .",
    "the reasons why we introduce the factor are as follows .",
    "when icy planetesimals go through the upper envelope , if undifferentiated like comet halley ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they release dust grains embedded in a matrix of ice upon evaporation .",
    "the deposited grains raise the grain opacities in the upper envelope . on the other hand , opacities of dust grains in the envelope",
    "may be reduced due to their coagulation and settling as described in introduction @xcite . in this study ,",

    "the solid , dashed , dotted , and dot - dashed curves correspond to the results for @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the double dot - dashed curve is the result of wholly - polluted envelopes . in all the calculations , we assume @xmath94 and @xmath95 . a sudden change in the slope at @xmath96 and the wholly - polluted envelopes appears because one of the major molecules , @xmath61 , is replaced with @xmath64 ( see the text ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    .free parameters and their values.[tbl1 ] [ cols=\"<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this study , we considered the envelope gas as ideal . in the case of the envelope with the solar abundances , we find that non - ideal effects cause less than @xmath97 change in the critical core mass .",
    "this paper aims to point out the importance to incorporate the effects of heavy - element enrichments in simulations of the structure and evolution of protoplanetary envelopes and to sort out what has a great impact on the critical core mass . including the effects of non - ideality of gas",
    "is a future study .",
    "we found that reactions between molecular compounds play a important role in determining the critical core mass .",
    "thus , we need thermodynamic quantities of non - ideal mixture of at least h , he , c , and o.      we should also pay attention to the dynamical stability of the envelope . @xcite found that the envelope with solar abundances is stable dynamically throughout quasi - static evolution up to jupiter s mass .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether the envelope polluted by heavy elements is stable or not . in this study ,",
    "reduction of @xmath11 due to molecular dissociations is one of important effects to lower @xmath6 and shorten @xmath98 .",
    "vibrational instability due to molecular dissociation may excite nonlinear hydrodynamical waves by @xmath8-mechanism because of reduction of @xmath11 and the rise in @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "nonlinear hydrodynamical waves may cause dynamical expansion of the envelope and the ejection of a large part of the envelope .",
    "thus , the dynamical stability of the polluted envelope should be also investigated in the future .",
    "it is worth while to consider the origin of jupiter and saturn from the viewpoint of core masses .",
    "interior modellings of the two planets suggest that jupiter s core is smaller than @xmath99 , while saturn s core is larger than @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that jupiter may possess a massive core of @xmath100 , but their interior modellings with rigid rotation are inconsistent with the observed value of the 4th - order gravitational moment , @xmath101 .",
    "in addition , @xcite pointed out that the mass fraction of helium used by @xcite is responsible for a massive core of jupiter .",
    "although the exact mass of jupiter s core is still an open question , the core mass of jupiter suggested by interior modellings is , on average , smaller than that of saturn .    in this study",
    ", we demonstrated that envelope pollution by icy planetesimals enables formation of gas giants with small cores , which seems compatible with recent modellings of jupiter .",
    "if so , how about the origin of saturn that is inferred to have a large core ?",
    "the large core inside saturn may reflect the history of high accretion rates of planetesimals .",
    "a variety of ideas for high accretion rates have been investigated so far  e.g. , the influence of growing proto - jupiter and the other protoplanets @xcite , type i migration of protoplanets @xcite , high stellar metallicity and a large initial disc mass @xcite , high initial surface density of solid materials @xcite .",
    "however , high accretion rates of planetesimals could have a risk of forming saturn with a small core .",
    "this is because a large amount of small - sized fragments are produced in the saturn s region due to frequent high - velocity collisions of planetesimals , so that the envelope should be polluted heavily by icy planetesimals .",
    "thus , we require to revisit accretion rates of planetesimals on to proto - saturn , for example , in the case where jupiter first emerges and other planetary cores still continue to grow .",
    "this is because planetary accretion proceeds more rapidly in the inner regions , so that proto - jupiter may have formed a small core first and triggered runaway gas accretion due to envelope pollution by icy planetesimals .    as one alternative idea for a large core of saturn",
    ", @xcite suggested that saturn might have experienced an impact of a ( proto- ) gas giant and then merged .",
    "it is still an open question whether such an impact on saturn happened in reality in a multiple - protoplanet system .",
    "direct n - body simulations of competitive core growth beyond the snow line will give an answer to this problem .",
    "we should also comment on another possibility that the disc instability scenario may be able to explain gas giants with small cores .",
    "the disc instability scenario is usually a single - stage model in which a massive protoplanetary disc , typically @xmath102 , becomes gravitationally unstable and rapidly collapses to form a proto - gas giant planet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent works on the disc instability scenario showed that a gaseous clump is able to capture planetesimals in the course of its rapid contraction , assuming concurrent formation of large - sized planetesimals @xcite or a gaseous clump is formed in a dense region where solid materials ( 1@xmath103 - 10@xmath104 ) are collected aerodynamically by spiral arms @xcite .",
    "in those scenarios , grains that grow to typically @xmath105 can settle down toward the centre against the stirring of convective motion and form a relatively small core .",
    "also the disc instability scenario is faced with the problem of saturn formation , although jupiter with a small core could be formed by the disc instability .",
    "one possibility to form a large core of saturn is that the existence of jupiter influences the distribution of planetesimals near jupiter s region and enhances the core growth of saturn . as mentioned in the above paragraph",
    ", this situation is the almost same as the envisioned picture of the saturn formation in the core - accretion model taking account into envelope pollution .",
    "more recently , @xcite has proposed another idea of gas giant formation with large cores by the disc instability : grain sedimentations inside a large gaseous clump yield a large core and trigger rapid gas accretion on to the core .",
    "when the clump migrates into a few au from a parent star , it experiences tidal disruption and evaporation due to stellar irradiation .",
    "it is peeled off the outer metal - poor envelope of the clump and then results in a saturn - like planet . in the future , further detailed studies will verify his idea .",
    "recent measurements of the mass and radius of transiting extrasolar gas giants ( egg ) allow us to constrain planetary composition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "those internal structures showed a variety of the total amount of heavy elements contained in transiting eggs , including cores .",
    "although it is not clear whether such a diversity of the amount of heavy elements in eggs reflects a diversity of their core masses , core masses of eggs are a key test to verify how efficiently our idea of envelope pollution works in reality .",
    "further transit observations of eggs and our comprehensive understanding of interior structures of eggs will help us to reveal formation of giant planets .",
    "finally , we consider an implication of interior structures of uranus and neptune .",
    "envelope pollution by icy planetesimals ( and erosion of their icy shells ) may be in good agreement with interior modellings of the present uranus and neptune .",
    "the @xmath106 envelopes enriched by volatile molecules such as @xmath12 and @xmath65 have been proposed in order to reproduce their observed gravitational moments ( @xmath107 and @xmath101 ) , which are poorly constrained @xcite .",
    "many recent works on interior modellings of uranus and neptune also suggested that they may have the @xmath106 envelopes into which `` ices '' are mixed instead of traditional three - layer models , that is density - stratified interiors @xcite . on the other hand , the fact that the present uranus and neptune have non - axisymmetric , non - dipolar magnetic fields may favour the existence of stably - stratified fluid layers beneath the outer thin shell that drives dynamo action @xcite . in addition , the compositional stratification in the interior may be responsible for extremely low - luminous uranus @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear whether the h / he envelopes are gradually - mixed with ices toward the centres or not . in any case , both uranus and neptune are likely to possess the outer polluted envelopes from the viewpoint of the gravitational harmonics and thermal evolution .",
    "their polluted envelopes may be consistent with the picture of envelope pollution by incoming icy planetesimals , although we can not rule out the another possibility for uranus that a giant impact on a primitive uranus results in the polluted @xmath106 envelope because the current uranus has the extreme axial tilt @xcite .",
    "we have investigated how envelope pollution by incoming icy planetesimals affects critical core masses ( @xmath6 ) and growth time - scales of the envelope ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "we considered that the envelope has two - layer structure : the upper layer with the solar abundances ( non - polluted layer ) and the lower one with mixture of solar and comet - halley - like compositions ( polluted layer ) .",
    "we introduced two key parameters , the mass fraction of the heavy elements in the lower envelope ( @xmath50 ) and the homopause temperature ( @xmath52 ) which defines the boundary between the two layers .",
    "the main results that we obtained in this study are summarized as follows .    * critical core masses : +   + envelope pollution by icy planetesimals lowers @xmath6 for any choice of values of @xmath52 and most of the range of @xmath108 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "widely - polluted ( low @xmath52 ) and highly - polluted ( high @xmath50 ) envelopes lessen @xmath6 remarkably .",
    "the increases in the molecular weight ( @xmath7 ) and reduction of adiabatic temperature gradient ( @xmath11 ) are responsible for the lowering of @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in particular , remarkable reduction of @xmath11 due to chemical reactions for 400 - 900k and molecule dissociations for @xmath109 2000k ( figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "such behaviour of @xmath6 is the same for any choices of other parameters , the grain opacities ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , the luminosity ( table  [ tbl3 ] ) , and the semimajor axes ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) . + * growth time - scales of the envelope : +   + we have simulated the growth of the protoplanetary envelope after the core growth stops .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that the envelope pollution can also hasten gas accretion on to the protoplanet ( fig.[fig8 ] ) , which implies that envelope pollution may enable gas giant formation with small cores ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and table  [ tbl4 ] ) .    to confirm that our idea really works ,",
    "further studies will be required : ( i ) chemical evolution in the polluted envelope coupled with eddy diffusion and inflow of disc gas , ( ii ) dynamical stability of the polluted envelope , ( iii ) competitive core growth ( planetary accretion ) beyond the snow line in a multiple - protoplanet system , ( iv ) the efficiency in mass deposits of icy planetesimals based on their trajectories and sizes in the envelope , ( v ) envelope pollution due to erosion of a core itself , and ( vi ) chemical equilibria of non - ideal gases in the polluted envelope .",
    "however , it is quite certain that envelope pollution by planetesimals occurs and affects the formation process of gas giants .",
    "we claim that it is necessary to take into account envelope pollution when we discuss gas giant formation based on the - core accretion model .",

    "<S> we have investigated how envelope pollution by icy planetesimals affects the critical core mass for gas giant formation and the gas accretion time - scales . in the core - accretion model , </S>",
    "<S> runaway gas accretion is triggered after a core reaches a critical core mass . </S>",
    "<S> all the previous studies on the core - accretion model assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals because icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via strong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that envelope pollution in general lowers the critical core masses and hastens gas accretion on to the protoplanet because of the increase in the molecular weight and reduction of adiabatic temperature gradient . widely- and highly - polluted envelopes allow smaller cores to form massive envelopes before disc dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that envelope pollution in the course of planetary accretion has the potential to trigger gas giant formation with small cores . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that it is necessary to take into account envelope pollution by icy planetesimals when we discuss gas giant formation based on the core - accretion model .    </S>",
