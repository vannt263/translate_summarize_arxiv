    "the interesting physical properties of ce - based intermetallic compounds have been the concern of numerous studies @xcite .",
    "the ground state of ce - based intermetallic compounds is often governed by the competition between the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction and the kondo interaction .",
    "depending on the strength of the hybridization between 4__f _ _ and conduction electrons relative to their coupling strength , the ground state can be either a non - magnetic state dominated by the kondo interaction or a long - range magnetically ordered state governed by the rkky interaction .",
    "various exotic phenomena have been observed in these compounds , for example : cecu@xmath2si@xmath2 was classified as a heavy fermion superconductor @xcite , ceagsb@xmath2 @xcite and ceagbi@xmath2 @xcite were reported to be strongly correlated electron compounds with a magnetically ordered ground state .",
    "it is often enlightening to study not just the ce - member of a rare earth , intermetallic series , but rather a wide sampling of the whole series .",
    "as exhibited in many rare earth series @xcite , the 4__f _ _ electrons are often shielded from the 5__s__- , 5__p__- and 4__d__-shell electrons , and thus do not participate in chemical bonding . on the other hand , the 4__f _ _ electrons have direct influences on the compounds magnetic properties , since the magnetic moments originate in the partially filled _ f_-shell . as a result , by varying the _ r _ elements in a compound , it is possible to tune the magnetism and other physical properties . moreover",
    ", the unit cell volume of isostructural @xmath3-bearing families shrinks from _",
    "= la to _ r _ = lu , which is known as the lanthanide contraction .",
    "this contraction leads to systematic changes in the lattice constants _ a _ , _ b _ , _ c _ and unit cell volume _",
    "v_.    recently ceni@xmath4bi@xmath2 has attracted particular attention : a polycrystalline sample was synthesized and reported as a heavy fermion superconductor @xcite .",
    "its @xmath5 was found to be @xmath6 4.2 k. the superconductivity was said to be associated with the light effective mass electrons , whereas the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition , occurring at @xmath6 5 k , was related to the strong interactions between the heavy electrons and ce 4__f _ _ electrons @xcite .",
    "the superconductivity was claimed to be introduced by the ni deficiency , as the  parent \" compound cenibi@xmath2 did not manifest bulk superconductivity @xcite .",
    "earlier results on cenibi@xmath2 suggested it to be a moderately heavy fermion antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "magnetic susceptibility was measured on single crystalline samples with no diamagnetic signal being observed , and the zero resistivity was attributed  to the thin films of bismuth \" @xcite .",
    "given that ni occupancy in the sample is claimed to play a key role in superconductivity , single crystalline samples of ceni@xmath4bi@xmath2 are likely to offer further understandings of the superconducting features in this system .",
    "hence , we present a study of physical properties of single crystalline ceni@xmath4bi@xmath2 samples .    the early work on the polycrystalline _ _ r__ni@xmath0bi@xmath1 samples ( _ r _ = ce ,",

    "later superconductivity with @xmath7 4 k was reported in this family for _ r _ = y , la , ce and nd @xcite . the results were based on the polycrystalline samples containing partial occupancy of the ni site . other than for ceni@xmath4bi@xmath2 , no detailed , anisotropic results were shown for other members in this family .    in this paper , we present a systematic study of the anisotropic properties of the _ _",

    "dy , compounds show local - moment like behavior with an afm ordering at low temperatures",
    ". measurements of the magnetization parallel to the _ ab_-plane and the _ c_-axis show anisotropic behavior , and the magnetization of some of the compounds indicate the existence of metamagnetic transitions .",
    "single crystals of _ _ r__ni@xmath0bi@xmath1 were grown out of excess bi flux via the high - temperature solution method @xcite .",
    "given that this series of compounds is known to have ni site deficiency , and that the ni deficiency was considered to be crucial for ceni@xmath0bi@xmath8 to become superconducting @xcite , we varied the composition of the starting materials , resulting in crystals with different ni concentrations .",
    "single crystals of ceni@xmath0bi@xmath8 with ( 1-_x _ ) varying from 0.64 to 0.85 ( as determined from wavelength - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy , see below ) were synthesized .",
    "irreproducible and incomplete transitions in resistivity data were seen for ( 1-_x _ ) = 0.64 , 0.75 , 0.80 and 0.85 .",
    "they are very likely associated with minority , second phase superconductivity .",
    "no qualitative differences were observed for these samples with different ( 1-_x _ ) values . in this work the starting stoichiometry that gives the resulting crystal with the ratio of ce : ni : bi = 1:0.8:2 was selected .",

    "high purity ( @xmath153n ) elements were placed in an alumina crucible and sealed in a fused silica tube under a partial pressure of high purity argon gas .",

    "most of the samples had shiny surfaces that were partially covered by secondary phase materials .",
    "due to the samples air - sensitivity , crystals were kept in an argon glove - box , and efforts were made to minimize their exposure to air during samples manipulation and measurements .",
    "they were neither etched nor polished , and only cleaved samples with fresh surface were used in the resistivity measurements .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction data were collected on a rigaku miniflex diffractometer with cu k@xmath20 radiation at room temperature .",
    "the sample was ground in a glove - box and the powder was protected from atmosphere by kapton film during the measurement so as to protect it from oxidation .",
    "the error bars associated with the values of the lattice parameters were determined by statistical errors , and si powder standard was used as the internal reference .",
    "elemental analysis of the samples was performed using wavelength - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( wds ) in a jeol jxa-8200 electron probe microanalyzer .",
    "only clear and shiny surface regions were selected for determination of the sample stoichiometry , i.e. regions with residual bi flux were avoided . for each compound , the wds data were collected from multiple points on the same sample .",
    "measurements of field dependent magnetization and temperature dependent susceptibility were performed in a quantum design , magnetic property measurement system ( mpms ) .",
    "the ac resistivity was measured by a standard four - probe method in a quantum design , physical property measurement system ( ppms ) or with lr700 ac resistance bridge in mpms .",
    "platinum wires were attached to the sample using dupont 4929 silver paint with the current flowing in the _ ab_-plane .",
    "the absolute values of resistivity are accurate to @xmath21 20@xmath22 due to the irregularity of the sample geometry and accuracy of measurements of electrical contacts position .",
    "the residual resistivity ratio is determined as ( rrr ) = @xmath23(300 k ) / @xmath23(5.0 k ) , so as to avoid any contamination from the minority phase superconductivity .",

    "the averaged atomic concentrations of each element in each compound were normalized to the rare earth element to have @xmath27 .",
    "the result shows that although the ratio of _ r_:ni : bi is grossly 1:1:2 , a significant ni deficiency develops across the series , and the bi concentration varies from slight excess to slight deficiency .",
    "given this series of compounds does not maintain a fixed , stoichiometric composition , for the calculation of physical quantities , the stoichiometries from table [ table : wds ] were used .",
    "it should be noted that if the bi stoichiometry is simply set to 2.00 , the values for effective moments vary significantly as the molar mass changes .",
    "for this reason the bi nonstoichiometry is also shown .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction patterns were collected on ground single crystals from each compound .",

    "similar results ( _ _ r__nibi@xmath8 with minority phase of bi ) were obtained for the other members of the series .",
    "the analysis of powder x - ray diffraction data indicates that the lattice parameters _ a _ and _ c _ are monotonically decreasing as the series progresses from la to dy ( presented in table [ table : powder ] ) .",

    "[ fig : lattice ] ) , which is consistent with the previously reported data @xcite . in progressing from lani@xmath30bi@xmath31 to dyni@xmath25bi@xmath26 ,",
    "the overall volume decreases by  9.8@xmath22 .",
    "these results are likely associated with the lanthanide contraction that occurs across the 4__f _ _ series .",
    "in addition , the deficiencies at the ni site can possibly lead to smaller unit cell volumes as well @xcite .",

    "we assume that this small rrr value is at least partially due to the deficiencies at the ni and bi sites .",
    "although the high temperature ( @xmath34 5 k ) resistivity is quite reproducible , sample to sample , below 5 k the sizes of the two resistive anomalies ( observed near 4.2 k and 3.0 k ) are very sample dependent ( fig . [ fig : la_rt ] ( a ) inset ) .",

    "the lower - temperature anomaly is probably caused by filamentary , thin film , bi presented in the sample , which is consistent with the previous work @xcite ; the @xmath5 of bi film can vary from 2 k to 5 k depending on its thickness @xcite .",
    "moreover , the drop of resistivity at @xmath6 4.2 k is always much smaller then the drop at @xmath6 3.0 k. this is possibly due to smaller amount of ni - bi binaries than bi film in the sample , which is consistent with the x - ray diffraction data ( where bi is clearly detected , and no ni - bi binary diffraction lines can be resolved ) .",

    "since the resistivity does not reach zero above 1.8 k , it implies that ceni@xmath28bi@xmath29 does not show bulk superconducting behavior , and the two lower - temperature anomalies are probably associated with minority second phase of ni - bi binaries and bi present in the sample .",
