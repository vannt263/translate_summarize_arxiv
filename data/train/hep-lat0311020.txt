    "anisotropic lattices , with temporal lattice spacing smaller than the spatial one , provide an effective method of precise monte carlo calculations of , for example , heavy quark systems , glueball masses , finite temperature properties of the qcd",
    ". properties of the anisotropic lattice with the standard plaquette action have been studied by several groups@xcite .    on the other hand , improved actions",
    "are proposed to obtain numerical results close to the continuum limit on relatively coarse lattices .",
    "therefore it is worth studying the anisotropic properties of the improved actions .    in the previous paper",
    ", we studied the anisotropic lattice for a class of improved actions in the weak coupling region , mainly using the perturbative method@xcite .",
    "the improved actions we considered are written in terms of the plaquette and 6-link rectangular loops as @xmath3 , \\label{impaction}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 satisfy the relation @xmath6 .",
    "the improved actions frequently used in the simulations correspond to the following parameters : @xmath7 ( symanzik s improved action@xcite ) , @xmath8 ( iwasaki s improved action@xcite ) , and @xmath9 ( qcdtaro s dbw2 action@xcite ) .    for these types of actions , we can formulate the anisotropic lattice in the same way as the standard plaquette action , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is a bare anisotropic parameter which controls the anisotropy in the space and time directions .",
    "the anisotropy is defined as the ratio of the lattice spacing in the spatial ( @xmath13 ) and the temporal ( @xmath14 ) directions , @xmath15 .",
    "due to quantum correction , @xmath16 is not equal to @xmath12",
    ". therefore it is essential to know their relationship before large scale simulations on the anisotropic lattice with improved actions are carried out .",
    "the effects of quantum correction have been studied using the parameter @xmath0 defined by @xmath17 in the weak coupling region , it is calculated perturbatively@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the one - loop perturbative results have been very impressive in the sense that as @xmath18 increases , qualitative change is observed in the behavior of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "if it is parametrized as @xmath19 the coefficient @xmath20 decreases as @xmath18 increases , and at around @xmath21 , it reaches to zero and then becomes negative .",
    "therefore @xmath22 of iwasaki action and dbd2 action decreases as @xmath2 decreases , while in the case of the standard and symanzik actions , it increases .",
    "namely , they have opposite @xmath2 dependences .",
    "the natural question is what would be the behavior of @xmath0 in the smaller @xmath2 region , where the perturbative calculation breaks down . in this work",
    ", we will focus on the @xmath0 parameter at @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and calculate it in the intermediate @xmath2 region where most current numerical simulations are carried out .",
    "in section 2 , we discuss appropriate regions of @xmath2 for the improved actions to evaluate @xmath0 , and explain some details of the calculation : matching of the lattice potential in the spatial and temporal directions , and the method of eliminating the effects of self - energy terms of lattice potential on an anisotropic lattice . for the standard action",
    ", the effect of the self - energy terms on @xmath0 has been studied by the bielefeld group @xcite .",
    "they reported that the effects on @xmath0 are small about @xmath25 throughout the parameter range that they studied .",
    "we discuss the effects for improved actions and show , in section 3 , that they are not large .    in section 3 ,",
    "@xmath0 for each improved action is presented .",
    "the @xmath0 behavior in the intermediate @xmath2 region is quite different for each improved action .",
    "iwasaki and dbw2 actions are qualitatively different in the one - loop perturbative calculation .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the discussion and conclusion .",
    "it is found that for iwasaki action , @xmath0 is close to unity in the region @xmath26 , indicating that the detailed calibration of @xmath12 for a given @xmath16 is not important unless a very precise simulation is carried out . for dbw2 action , @xmath0 remains essentially constant , indicating that rough calibration gives a reasonable estimation of @xmath0 . for symanzik action",
    "some detailed calculation of @xmath0 is necessary , as in the case of standard action .    for the calculation of the @xmath0 parameter",
    ", measurements of the large wilson loops are required .",
    "large wilson loops suffer from huge fluctuation of the gauge fields , particularly in the confined phase . to suppress the fluctuation ,",
    "the link integration method has been proposed @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have applied the link integration method in small @xmath2 regions . here , it is very important to choose an adequate radius ( optimal radius ) of integration in the complex plane . for the standard action",
    ", the optimal radius was studied by the bielefeld group @xcite . in appendix",
    "a , we describe the optimal radii for symanzik and iwasaki actions .",
    "in this work , we calculate the @xmath0 parameter in the regions of @xmath2 where most numerical calculations are currently carried out . in the case of standard action , hadron spectroscopy in the quench approximation has been reported for @xmath27 @xcite . in these coupling constant regions ,",
    "the light hadron masses are reproduced within @xmath28 accuracy , which may be the limit of the quench approximation .",
    "therefore , we calculate the @xmath0 parameter around these lattice spacings for the improved actions .    in order to estimate the lattice spacing for the improved actions , we use the critical @xmath2 ( @xmath29 ) of finite temperature transition . for standard action",
    ", @xmath30 corresponds to the finite temperature transition point of the @xmath31 lattice@xcite",
    ". therefore we estimate @xmath29 at @xmath31 for the improved actions . for tree level",
    "improved symanzik action , @xmath29 s are reported for @xmath32 and 6@xcite , and for iwasaki action , they have been calculated at @xmath33 by the tsukuba group@xcite and at @xmath34 , by the yamagata - hiroshima collaboration@xcite . for dbw2 action ,",
    "they are reported by the qcdtaro collaboration@xcite for @xmath35 and 6 .",
    "@xmath29 at @xmath34 is estimated using the two loop asymptotic scaling relation for lattice spacing , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the lattice spacing and @xmath38 ) , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we applied two methods for the estimation of @xmath29 at @xmath31 . in method 1 , we use @xmath29 at @xmath41 of the same action to estimate @xmath42 using @xmath43 . in method 2 , we use the @xmath44 of the standard action to evaluate @xmath42 of the other action with the @xmath45 parameter@xcite .",
    "they are summarized in the table [ table1 ] .",
    "+        @xmath49 region may change with the position of link on a configuration and also with configurations .",
    "the results shown in fig.[rssiwa_all ] are obtained for a link at the center of the configuration in space and time directions , which are fully thermalized .",
    "however the fluctuation of the @xmath49 region is not large .",
    "if we choose , @xmath46 , it has been in an optimal region of @xmath50 for all link variables and configurations .",
    "let us proceed to discuss the effects of the link integration method .",
    "in the case of improved actions , the number of link @xmath51 which are simultaneously integrated in a wilson loop becomes much smaller than the case of standard action , because in the case of improved action the background fields @xmath52 of eq . [ zr ]",
    "extend wider range due to the 6-link rectangular loop in the action .",
    "therefore the effect of link integration method is reduced in these cases , and is not effective for the calculation of smaller wilson loops .",
    "the suppression of the fluctuation is impressive for @xmath53 but not for @xmath54 .",
    "the similar properties are observed for the symanzik action of @xmath55 and @xmath54 at @xmath56 .",
    "the link integration needs much cpu - time , and therefore the link integration method is effective for the calculation of large wilson loops in the confined phase or very close to the transition point .",
