    "understanding the effects of random pinning on the properties of the mixed phase of high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) and other type - ii superconductors is of fundamental importance in the development of a theory of the effects of quenched disorder on the equilibrium and dynamical behavior of a collection of interacting objects ( vortex lines or pancake vortices in the case of superconductors in the mixed phase ) .",
    "this subject is also of great practical importance because most applications of htscs require a large critical current , which can be achieved only in the presence of effective pinning .",
    "columnar pinning arising from damage tracks produced by heavy - ion bombardment has received much attention in this context because such extended defects parallel to the direction of the average magnetic flux are very effective  @xcite in increasing the critical current by localizing vortex lines along their length .",
    "heavy - ion irradiation produces parallel columnar defects , in a random configuration , each of which can trap one or more vortex lines at low temperatures .",
    "the effects of an array of such extended defects , oriented perpendicular to the superconducting layers , on the properties of the mixed phase of htscs in a magnetic field perpendicular to the layers have been extensively studied experimentally  @xcite , theoretically  @xcite , and numerically  @xcite . in the regime",
    "in which the areal concentration of randomly placed columnar pins exceeds that of vortex lines ( as determined by the value of the magnetic induction @xmath0 ) the behavior of this system is now fairly well - understood .",
    "theoretical studies  @xcite based on a mapping of the thermodynamics of the system to the quantum mechanical properties of a two - dimensional system of interacting bosons in a random potential , as well as experimental  @xcite studies , have established that in this regime the system undergoes a continuous phase transition between a low - temperature `` strong '' bose glass ( bog ) phase and a high - temperature vortex liquid phase . in the `` strong '' bog phase",
    "nearly all the vortex lines are strongly pinned at columnar defects and both translational and bond - orientational correlations of the vortex lines are short - range , indicating a strongly disordered structure .",
    "the behavior of the system in the `` dilute pin '' regime , where the number of columnar pins is much smaller than the number of vortex lines , is much less well understood .",
    "several years ago , it was pointed out by radzihovsky  @xcite that in this regime the system may exhibit a first - order transition between a low - temperature `` weak '' bog and a high - temperature vortex liquid . in the `` weak '' bog phase",
    "only a fraction of vortex lines are strongly pinned at the columnar defects , and the remaining vortex lines are weakly pinned in the interstitial region between defects . the liquid phase into which the `` weak '' bog melts upon increasing the temperature",
    "is expected to have a mixed character in the sense that some of the vortices remain pinned at the pinning centers , while the other , interstitial ones form a liquid .",
    "this partially pinned interstitial liquid ( il ) should then exhibit a crossover to a completely depinned vortex liquid at a higher temperature .",
    "this behavior is also suggested in a recent theoretical study  @xcite based on the analogy of the vortex system with a two - dimensional system of bosons in a random potential .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite on the highly anisotropic , layered htsc @xmath1 ( bscco ) with a small concentration of randomly placed columnar pins perpendicular to the layers have provided many interesting results , some of which are in agreement with the theoretical predictions mentioned above .",
    "these experiments were carried out for different values of the relative pin concentration @xmath2 , ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of columnar pins , @xmath5 the number of vortex lines and @xmath6 the `` matching field '' ) . for small values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the experiments indicate a first - order phase transition between a high - temperature vortex liquid and a low - temperature bog phase in which the vortices are arranged in a polycrystalline structure with grain boundaries separating crystalline regions of different orientations .",
    "the temperature at which this transition occurs remains close to the melting temperature of the vortex lattice in samples without columnar pins , if the value of @xmath2 is sufficiently small .",
    "as @xmath2 is increased while keeping @xmath0 ( and hence the density of vortex lines ) constant , the transition temperature begins to increase .",
    "this is in agreement with theoretical predictions  @xcite . as @xmath2 is increased further , the nature of the transition changes from first - order to continuous . for small values of @xmath2 , the liquid into which the bog melts has the `` mixed '' character mentioned above ",
    "it is called vortex `` nanoliquid '' in ref .  .",
    "this partially pinned interstitial liquid undergoes a crossover to a fully depinned vortex liquid as the temperature is increased further .",
    "the temperature at which this crossover occurs is found to be nearly independent of the pin concentration , whereas the melting temperature of the bog phase increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the temperature range over which the interstitial vortex liquid exists becomes narrower with increasing @xmath2 , and eventually goes to zero .",
    "thus , for sufficiently high values of @xmath2 , the bog melts directly into a liquid in which all the vortices are delocalized .    some of the characteristic features found in the experiments mentioned above have been reproduced in simulations of a collection of interacting vortex lines in the presence of a random array of columnar pins .",
    "these include the polycrystalline nature of the low - temperature bog phase  @xcite , the increase of its melting temperature with increasing pin concentration for strong columnar pins  @xcite , and the occurrence of an interstitial liquid phase for low values of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the simulations of ref .   have also provided evidence for the existence of an additional phase , a topologically ordered bragg glass ( brg )  @xcite , at low temperatures in systems with a small concentration of weak columnar pins .",
    "assuming the magnetic field to be perpendicular to the layers , the vortex lines in highly anisotropic layered htscs may be thought of as stacks of pancake vortices localized on the superconducting layers .",
    "these pancake vortices constitute a system of pointlike objects that interact among themselves and also with a potential , external to them , arising from the pinning centers .",
    "we have recently performed a study  @xcite of the thermodynamic and structural properties of such a system , with a very small concentration of randomly distributed , strong , columnar pins perpendicular to the layers .",
    "we used a density functional theory , based on the ramakrishnan - yussouff free energy functional  @xcite , to analyze the structure and equilibrium properties of this classical system of pointlike objects . in this method",
    "the free energy is expressed as a functional of the time - averaged local density of the pancake vortices .",
    "different local minima of the free energy represent different possible phases of the system in this mean - field description .",
    "a numerical minimization procedure locates the various minima of the free energy functional .",
    "the phase diagram of the system in the relevant parameter space was then mapped out by locating the points where the free energies of different minima cross .",
    "there are three distinct phases for very small values ( @xmath7 ) of the pin concentration : a topologically ordered brg phase  @xcite , a polycrystalline bog phase , and an il phase with coexistence of localized and mobile vortices .",
    "the brg is the equilibrium phase at low temperatures at these small values of @xmath2 . as the temperature @xmath8",
    "is increased , this phase melts into the il in _ two steps _  the brg and il phases are separated by a small region of the bog phase .",
    "both the brg - to - bog transition and the bog - to - il transition which occurs at a slightly higher t were found to be first - order , indicating a two - step first - order melting of the nearly crystalline , topologically ordered brg phase . experimentally observed spatial variations of a `` local '' transition temperature  @xcite were also reproduced .    in this paper , we present the results of our investigation of the behavior of the same system for larger values of the pin concentration , thereby generating the phase diagram in the entire relevant area of the @xmath8-@xmath2 plane .",
    "the methods used in this study are the same as those used  @xcite for the small-@xmath2 regime .",
    "the objective here is to connect the behavior found for small @xmath2 with the well - known results ( continuous transition between a low - temperature bog phase and a high - temperature depinned vortex liquid ) for large @xmath2 .",
    "another motivation is to provide an understanding of some of the experimental observations mentioned above .",
    "the main results of our present study are as follows .",
    "we find that the width ( in temperature ) of the intermediate bog phase that separates the low - temperature brg and high - temperature il phases increases initially as the pin concentration @xmath2 is increased from a very small value at fixed @xmath0 . as @xmath2 is increased further , the brg minimum of the free energy ceases to be the one with the lowest free energy at low temperatures .",
    "this observation indicates that the brg phase is thermodynamically stable only if the pin concentration is smaller than a critical value .",
    "this critical value of @xmath2 turns out to be close to 1/32 for the system parameters ( appropriate for bscco ) used in our calculation , at @xmath9 kg . for higher values of @xmath2",
    ", we find a low - temperature polycrystalline bog phase and a high - temperature il phase .",
    "the transition between these two phases becomes continuous as the value of @xmath2 is increased .",
    "a continuous transition is difficult to locate in a mean - field calculation . in that case",
    "the minimum representing the low - temperature bog phase transforms continuously into that corresponding to the high - temperature il phase as the temperature is increased : there is no free - energy crossing that can be used to define the transition temperature . indeed",
    ", it becomes difficult to distinguish a true continuous transition from a crossover .",
    "guided by existing theoretical and experimental results ( summarized above ) , we assume that there is a continuous transition , and then locate the transition temperature using a criterion based on _ the occurrence of percolation of liquid - like regions across the sample_. the transition temperature obtained from this definition was found  @xcite at lower @xmath2 to coincide with that obtained from free energy crossings .",
    "the details are explained in sec .",
    "[ res ] below . in a study",
    "@xcite of the two - dimensional disordered bosonic hubbard model , it was found that the transition between the bog and superfluid phases nearly coincides with the onset of percolation of sites that have large values of the superfluid order parameter .",
    "since the system we are considering can be mapped approximately to a two - dimensional system of interacting bosons in a random potential , we believe that the percolation - based criterion we have used to determine the transition temperature is quite reasonable .    the bog ",
    "il transition temperature obtained this way increases slightly as the pin concentration is increased at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the bog phase continues to exhibit a polycrystalline structure as @xmath2 is increased : the typical size of crystalline domains decreases with increasing @xmath2 . to estimate the depinning temperature",
    ", we monitor the average value of the integrated density of pancake vortices inside the range of the pinning potential of each columnar defect .",
    "this quantity decreases as the temperature is increased .",
    "we define the depinning temperature as that at which the integrated density falls below an appropriately chosen critical value .",
    "the depinning temperature obtained this way decreases slowly with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this happens because  @xcite two pinning centers can not be simultaneously occupied by vortices if they happen to be very close to each other .",
    "this effect reduces the average pinning efficiency of a defect as @xmath2 is increased . for the range of @xmath2 we have considered ( @xmath10 )",
    ", the depinning temperature is found to lie above the temperature at which the bog phase transforms into a liquid .",
    "so , for these values of the pin concentration , the liquid phase into which the bog melts can be classified as il , with a coexistence of pinned and delocalized vortices .",
    "our results indicate that the il would disappear ( the bog would melt into a depinned liquid ) at a value of @xmath2 just slightly higher than @xmath11 . from that point on , there would be a single transition between the low - temperature bog and a high - temperature depinned vortex liquid : thus our work encompasses all the interesting parts of the phase diagram in the @xmath2 vs. @xmath8 plane . using a criterion based on the degree of localization of the vortices ,",
    "we define a local transition temperature and find that this temperature exhibits spatial variations similar to those found in experiments  @xcite .",

    "the main results obtained in this work are presented and discussed in detail in section  [ res ] .",

    "the general method used in this study has been described previously@xcite and we will keep the discussion here to the minimum necessary to establish notation .",
    "we consider the limit of highly anisotropic layered superconductors with vanishing interlayer josephson coupling . in this limit",
    ", the energy of a system of pancake vortices can be written as a sum over anisotropic pair - wise interactions .",
    "this limit is appropriate to htscs of the tl and bi families .",
    "we will use material parameters appropriate to bscco throughout this work .",
    "the pinning potential due to a collection of columnar pins perpendicular to the layers is the same on all the layers .",
    "this implies that the time - averaged local density @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is a two - dimensional vector denoting the position on a layer ) of pancake vortices is also the same on all the layers .",

    "we find here that , as one increases @xmath2 , the temperature region where the intermediate bog occurs first becomes wider .",
    "however , as @xmath2 exceeds 1/32 , the brg drops out of the picture : the free energy of any phase that may be identified as brg - like becomes , as we shall see , too high , and the only transition is between the il and a bog phase .",

    "the second kind is obtained by quenching to similar temperatures with liquid - like initial conditions .",

    "the pinning energy is minimized in the bog phase by having essentially all pinning centers occupied by vortices in this phase ( see section [ depin ] below ) .",
    "the free energy cost of forming the brg state arises from two sources : first its pinning energy is higher because pinning centers that lie far away from any lattice point of the crystalline initial state used for obtaining a brg minimum are not fully occupied by vortices ( a similar behavior was found in the simulation of ref . ) .",
    "second , there is extra elastic energy associated with the formation of the defect clusters with zero net burgers vector .",
    "these defect clusters , found mostly near pinning centers , are formed as the effect of the randomly located pinning centers is accommodated in the initial crystalline structure by small displacements of the vortices from their ideal lattice positions towards the nearest pinning center . these `` uncharged '' defect clusters , called `` twisted bond defects ''  @xcite , cost relatively little energy because they can be formed by distorting the lattice at short range . the energy cost of forming these defect clusters is proportional to their number at the relevant small @xmath2 values .",

    "the distribution broadens markedly with increasing @xmath2 and a small secondary peak on the low side develops . at these values of @xmath8 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the percentage of pinning sites that hold only a small fraction of a vortex is clearly not negligible .",
    "this behavior can be understood from a consideration of the effects of neighboring pins on the probability of a particular pinning center being occupied by a vortex . due to the strong short - distance repulsive interaction between two vortices ,",
    "two pinning centers that lie very close to each other can not be simultaneously occupied . as shown in ref .",
    ", this interaction effect becomes important when the separation between two pinning centers becomes smaller than about half the average intervortex spacing .",
    "specifically , it was shown there that for values of @xmath0 , @xmath8 and the pinning parameters @xmath37 and @xmath130 very similar to those used in the present calculation , two pinning centers separated by less than @xmath34 are not simultaneously occupied .",
    "we find that all the pinning centers for which the value of @xmath132 is less than 50 have at least another pinning center within a distance @xmath34 from them .",
    "the probability of finding such closely spaced pairs of pinning centers obviously increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "this is the reason for the broadening of the distribution of @xmath132 on the low side as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "the pinning efficiency of a pinning center can also be enhanced by the presence of a neighboring pin if the distance between the two pins is close to the average intervortex spacing  @xcite .",

    "it is therefore appropriate to associate the depinning temperature with the point where each curve in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] crosses the `` critical '' value of 0.6 , and this criterion has been used to determine the location of the depinning line in fig .",
    "this criterion is very similar to the one used in ref .   where the effects of other pinning centers on the pinning properties of a particular one were not considered .",

    "there is , however , a small discrepancy : the experimental results  @xcite show a small increase of the depinning temperature with increasing @xmath2 , whereas we find a small decrease .",
    "this difference may be understood as arising from the different criteria used to define the depinning crossover , in the following way .    in the experiment",
    "@xcite , the depinning temperature is determined from the difference between the transport currents in the pristine ( without columnar pins ) and irradiated ( with columnar pins ) regions of the sample .",
    "this difference arises because the pinning property of the il ( which is found only in the irradiated parts of the sample ) with both liquid- and solid - like regions is different from that of the homogeneous vortex liquid that exists in the pristine parts of the sample .",
    "now , our study shows that solid - like regions in the il occur near clusters of columnar pins ( see , e.g. fig .  3 of ref .  ) .",
    "the pinning property of such a solid - like region depends both on the pinning efficiency of individual pins , and on the size ( number of pins ) of the cluster of pins present in the region .",
    "the average cluster size increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "so , it is reasonable to expect that the pinning efficiency of a typical solid - like region in the il would also increase with @xmath2 .",
    "also , the fraction of solid - like regions in the il at a fixed temperature would be higher for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "these considerations imply that the pinning properties of the inhomogeneous il would become similar to those of the homogeneous liquid at a higher @xmath8 in samples with larger @xmath2 .",
    "thus , this effect tends to increase the delocalization temperature obtained from the current distribution as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "it may dominate over the small decrease arising from the effect found in our calculation , thereby producing a overall increase in the measured delocalization temperature as the value of c is increased . a similar argument",
    "would also explain the differences between our results for the depinning line and those obtained in the simulations of nonomura and hu  @xcite who used the measured value of the tilt modulus to determine the depinning temperature . since the depinning is a crossover , not a thermodynamic phase transition , it is not surprising that different criteria lead to slightly different results for the depinning temperature .",
    "we have reported here the results of a detailed investigation of the phase diagram of a highly anisotropic layered superconductor with columnar pinning in the temperature ( @xmath8 )  pin concentration ( @xmath2 ) plane . for small values of @xmath2",
    ", we confirm the occurrence  @xcite of a topologically ordered brg phase at low temperatures and a two - step first - order melting of the brg phase into an il , with a small region of intermediate polycrystalline bog phase . in the il ,",
    "a fraction of vortices remains localized at the strong pinning centers .",
    "the il crosses over into a completely delocalized vortex liquid at a depinning temperature that is higher than the temperature at which the bog  il transition occurs .",
    "the brg phase disappears as the pin concentration is increased and the two - step melting found at low pin concentrations is replaced by a single continuous transition from a low - temperature bog phase to a high - temperature il .",
    "this transition corresponds to the onset of percolation of liquid - like regions across the system .",
    "the temperature at which this percolation transition occurs increases with increasing pin concentration , while the depinning temperature is nearly independent of the pin concentration .",
    "consequently , the width of the temperature interval in which the il is found decreases and eventually goes to zero when the pin concentration becomes sufficiently high ( slightly above 1/8 ) .",
    "although the system we have considered here is three dimensional , since we do take into account the electromagnetic interaction between vortices on different layers , the correlated nature of the pinning produced by the columnar defects makes it , in some sense , quasi two dimensional .",
    "the presence of a brg phase in our phase diagram may then appear surprising in view of the well - known result  @xcite that a brg phase does not exist in two dimensions .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that a brg phase is unlikely to exist in a three dimensional system with columnar pins . from our study of finite - size samples , we can not , of course , rule out the possibility that for any non - zero value of the pin concentration @xmath2 , disorder - induced free dislocations would appear at length scales much larger than those accessible in our study .",
    "it is , however , very clear from our results ( see results above and also refs .  ) that the structure of the nearly crystalline minima we have found for small @xmath2 is qualitatively different from that of the polycrystalline bog minima found for the same values of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , our conclusion about the occurrence of a first - order phase transition between the polycrystalline bog phase found near the melting transition and a much more ordered phase found at low temperatures for small @xmath2 would remain valid even if the nature of the nearly crystalline phase turns out to be different from a true brg .",
    "several noteworthy features found in our study have been observed in experiments  @xcite on bscco with small concentrations of random columnar pins : thus , our findings of the polycrystalline nature of the low - temperature bog phase for small pin concentrations ; the existence of the il ( called `` vortex nanoliquid '' in ref .  ) with a coexistence of pinned and delocalized vortices , which crosses over into a fully delocalized vortex liquid at a `` depinning '' temperature ; the existence of a first - order transition between the il and bog phases for small values of @xmath2 , which becomes continuous as @xmath2 is increased keeping @xmath0 constant ; the increase of the bog  il transition temperature with increasing pin concentration ; and the spatial variations of a locally defined transition temperature , all are in agreement with experimental results .",
    "our results are also similar to those obtained in the simulation of ref .  , except for some small differences in the location of the depinning line which",
    ", as discussed in section [ depin ] , may be attributed to the use of different criteria for determining the temperature at which the depinning crossover occurs .",
    "the low - temperature brg phase found here for small @xmath2 has not yet been observed in experiments . as discussed in ref .",
    ", this may be due to the metastability of the bog phase into which the vortex liquid freezes as the temperature is decreased in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "explorations of ways in which this metastability can be avoided would be worthwhile .",
    "we note that a recent study  @xcite of grain boundaries in vortex matter suggests that the melting of the vortex lattice in unpinned systems can also be preceded by an intermediate polycrystalline phase .",
    "our computations have been performed for a fixed value of the magnetic induction , @xmath0 = 2 kg .",
    "the behavior of the system for other values of @xmath0 may be inferred from our results by combining them with those of other existing studies  @xcite . as discussed in section  [ largec ] , we find that for fixed @xmath0 the number of crystalline domains in a polycrystalline bog minimum is proportional to the pin concentration @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that the typical size of the crystalline domains is determined primarily by the arrangement of the pinning centers .",
    "if this is so then for a fixed arrangement of the pinning centers , the typical number of vortices lying inside a crystalline grain would be proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "this is precisely as observed in the above mentioned experiments of ref .  .",
    "earlier studies  @xcite of the model of pancake vortices considered here indicate that interlayer vortex correlations decrease as @xmath0 is increased and the system becomes effectively two - dimensional ( the melting temperature of the pure vortex lattice approaches that of the two - dimensional system ) in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "existing studies  @xcite of the ground states ( or low - lying local minima of the energy ) of randomly pinned two - dimensional vortex arrays show polycrystalline structures similar to those found for the bog phase in our work .",
    "we therefore expect that the polycrystalline structure of the bog phase would remain essentially unchanged as @xmath0 is increased for a fixed concentration of pinning centers . since the melting temperature of the pure vortex lattice decreases  @xcite with increasing @xmath0 , the temperature at which the bog ",
    "il transition occurs would be expected to decrease as @xmath0 is increased at constant pin concentration .",
    "existing results  @xcite about the absence of a true bragg glass in two dimensions suggest that the brg phase found for small @xmath2 in our study would not be present in the effectively two - dimensional large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "numerical studies  @xcite in which the vortex system is represented by a frustrated xy model do not find any clear evidence for the formation of polycrystalline structures , whereas all existing numerical studies  @xcite in which the vortices are modeled as interacting particles ( or lines ) indicate that the structure of the low - temperature disordered phase is polycrystalline , as found in our study .",
    "the reason for this difference is not clear",
    ". it may be due to the smallness of the sample sizes ( @xmath133 100 vortex lines in the simulation of ref .  ) used in the studies based on the frustrated xy model .",
    "a polycrystalline structure can be discerned clearly if the crystalline grains are large enough ( e.g. for @xmath2 = 1/64 and 1/32 in our calculation ) .",
    "such large grains would be observed in a simulation only if the sample size is much larger than the typical grain size , which is probably not the case in the simulations of refs .   for weak pinning . for stronger pinning , the typical grain size would become smaller than the sample sizes considered in these studies .",
    "however , in this limit , it would be difficult to distinguish a polycrystalline structure from an amorphous one .",
    "this difficulty should be clear from an inspection of a small part ( containing @xmath133 100 vortices ) of the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( for @xmath45 ) for which the grain size is small .",
    "quantitatively , this mean - field calculation is expected to provide accurate results for the transition temperatures as long as the transitions are strongly first - order .",
    "this is true for the transitions that occur at small values of @xmath2 in our phase diagram .",
    "our predictions are quantitatively less reliable for larger values of @xmath2 for which the transition is continuous .",
    "the method of locating the transition temperature from the crossing of the free energies of different local minima of the free energy does not work when the transition is not first - order .",
    "strictly speaking , the alternative method of identifying the transition point as the temperature at which liquid - like regions percolate across the system can not conclusively determine whether there is a true continuous transition for large @xmath2 , or just a crossover from a high - temperature liquid - like state to a low - temperature frozen state .",
    "we assume that a continuous bog ",
    "il transition occurs in this regime because such a transition is found in transport experiments and in numerical work in which the superconducting phase variables are included .",
    "these aspects are not accessible in our work because the free energy we consider involves only the local density of the vortices .",
    "however , we believe that our estimate of the bog ",
    "il transition temperature from the percolation criterion we have used is reliable .",
    "the reason for this assertion is that a similar criterion works quantitatively well for the continuous transition in disordered two - dimensional boson models to which the vortex problem we consider here can be mapped .",
    "also , transitions between liquid and glassy phases in several other systems , such as colloidal systems  @xcite and thin polymeric films  @xcite , have been quite satisfactorily described in the past in terms of percolation criteria similar to the one used here .",
    "it would be interesting to test the validity of this description of the bog ",
    "il transition in experiments in which magneto - optic techniques  @xcite can be used to map out the local liquid- or solid - like character of different regions of the sample .",
