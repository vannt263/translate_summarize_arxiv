    "in recent years , quantum turbulence has become an established research area in low - temperature physics.@xcite the similarities and differences of quantum turbulence in relation to classical turbulence comprise one area of interest of quantum turbulence .",
    "for example , although both classical and quantum turbulences consist of eddies or vortices , these two kinds of turbulences are quite different in terms of their hydrodynamic properties .",
    "first , classical fluid can have arbitrary vorticity , while in contrast the vorticity in superfluid @xmath0he is quantized ; circulation around a quantized vortex is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is planck s constant and @xmath3 is mass of @xmath0he atom , with the core size of a quantized vortex given by the healing length of superfluid @xmath0he , which is about the atomic size of @xmath0he .",
    "moreover , quantized vortices can not be generated under usual experimental conditions , unlike eddies in classical fluids . instead , remnant vortices are essential for the generation of quantum turbulence .",
    "it is believed that remnant vortices are usually pinned to the roughness of the wall.@xcite indeed , hashimoto _ _ et al.__@xcite experimentally showed that quantum turbulence can not be generated without remnant vortices .",
    "second , classical fluid is viscous , while superfluid @xmath0he consists of viscous normal fluid and an inviscid superfluid according to a two - fluid model .",
    "the two fluids are coupled in turbulence through mutual friction , which is the interaction between vortices and normal fluid .",
    "the ratio of the two fluids is temperature dependent , and the normal fluid dominates the fluid if the temperature is close to the transition temperature , while in the limit of zero temperature , the superfluid component dominates the fluid , and pure quantum turbulence is achieved . the attention of the present study is confined to this latter limiting case .    in spite of the above distinct properties",
    ", quantum and classical turbulences also exhibit similarities .",
    "kolmogorov s law , which is a statistical law found in a classical turbulence , has also been observed in quantum turbulence both experimentally and numerically.@xcite this law can thus be taken to be universal over quantum and classical turbulences",
    ".    under this new motivation , quantum turbulence has recently been studied , and accordingly the progress of experimental techniques has given rise to a variety of methods to create and observe quantum turbulence . to both create and detect quantum turbulence , objects oscillating in a superfluid , such as spheres , grids , thin wires , and tuning forks are often employed.@xcite the most commonly measured physical quantity is the velocity of the oscillating objects . at",
    "temperatures lower than 1 k , the velocity exhibits the clear transition from laminar to turbulent state when the driving force is increased.@xcite for magnitudes of velocities less than about 50 mm / s , the drag force is proportional to the oscillation velocity due to collisions between the oscillating object and some remaining excitations . at higher magnitudes of velocity ,",
    "the drag force is proportional to the square of the oscillation velocity magnitude because turbulence is generated around the object .",
    "these results also describe a similarity between quantum and classical turbulence ; in classical fluid , the drag force on an object in a uniform flow at high reynolds number is described by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the drag coefficient , @xmath6 is the density of the fluid , @xmath7 is the projection area of the object normal to the flow , and @xmath8 is the flow velocity.@xcite this relation could be applicable to quantum turbulence created by an oscillating object . at low reynolds number , stokes s drag force acts on the object , which is proportional to the magnitude of the flow velocity , with the result that the drag coefficient @xmath5 becomes inversely proportional to the magnitude of the flow velocity .",
    "fitting experimental results to a relationship of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : drag_force ] ) , we derive a constant drag coefficient , which is of order unity , as for classical turbulence .    in this paper",
    ", we shall further add to knowledge of the similarities of quantum and classical turbulences by presenting numerical simulations of the drag force and coefficient on the oscillating object .",
    "however , in calculating the drag force numerically , the pressure on the object needs to be calculated over the entire surface of the object .",
    "the pressure at each point on the object can be calculated from the velocity field by euler s equation , and the velocity field is generated by the vortices .",
    "it is possible to calculate the pressure if the number of the vortices is relatively small,@xcite but it is difficult with current computational resources to integrate the pressure in quantum turbulence in cases where a large number of vortices exist . as a consequence , we shall introduce a method to evaluate the drag force .",
    "we assume that the oscillating object does work on the fluid when the vortices are grown by the object and that a drag force is caused as a result of the work .",
    "it is shown later that the drag force can be estimated from the energy given to the fluid by the object in an equilibrium state of quantum turbulence .",
    "the increase in the kinetic energy of the fluid can be evaluated from the energy of vortices grown by the object .",
    "finally , from the energy given per unit time divided by the velocity of the object we derive the drag force .    in this paper ,",
    "the drag force in quantum turbulence is targeted for the following reason : the drag force becomes definite according to the method of this paper only if the vortices are grown by the oscillating object . in the laminar regime , it is expected that the drag force is caused by collisions between the object and excitations and that the growth of vortices is not essential . in the turbulent regime , on the other hand",
    ", the drag force is caused by the growth of vortices .",
    "for this reason , we focus on the dynamics of vortices around an oscillating object and solve the equations of motion for the vortices numerically .    in the simulation , we consider an object oscillating with a constant magnitude of velocity @xmath9 , and estimate the drag force due to the vortices , that is the drag force @xmath10 is described in the form @xmath11 .",
    "note that this is in contrast to experimental studies , which measure the oscillation velocity of the object for a certain driving force , obtaining the velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the functional relation @xmath11 used in the present simulations is thus inverse to the relation used in the experiments , but it is worth comparing the results for the following reason . as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ turbulence ] , when the object oscillates , remnant vortices are stretched and the vortex tangle grows , which results in the drag force on the object . finally , the vortex tangle reaches an equilibrium state of quantum turbulence .",
    "the drag force is then uniquely determined by the oscillation velocity in the simulation . in an experimental equilibrium state@xcite on the other hand , the drag force responsible for the dissipation by vortices must be equal to the driving force that injects the energy into the system . in addition ,",
    "the oscillation velocity is measured under a constant driving force , namely , drag force in an equilibrium state of turbulence in the experiments .",
    "hence there is one - to - one correspondence between the oscillation velocity and the drag force , which allows us to compare the drag force of the simulation with that of the experiments .",
    "the coupled dynamics of vortices and the oscillating object is not considered in this work , which is validated by verifying that the drag force depends only on the oscillation velocity .",
    "the oscillation of the object causes the growth of vortices , and the rate of the growth depends on the oscillation velocity because the vortices attached to the object are stretched by the object ( details in sec .",
    "[ turbulence ] ) .",
    "the vortex dynamics are influenced only by the magnitude of the oscillation velocity irrespective of whether the dynamics of the object are considered or not .",
    "this is because since the drag force is evaluated from the rate of the vortex growth , the drag force does not depend on the details of the motion of the object but the oscillation velocity .",
    "a previous numerical simulation of an oscillating sphere was performed by hnninen _ _ et al.__@xcite they used the same size of the sphere and frequency of the oscillation as the experiment of shoepe _ _ et al.__@xcite the simulation seems to show a growth of vortices toward turbulence , but an equilibrium state of quantum turbulence is not achieved , which differs from the present results .",
    "this is because in hnninen _",
    "et al._s@xcite study the vortices extending between the wall and the sphere remained attached and continued to generate vortex rings , while in our simulations , mature vortices are soon detached from the object and the remaining vortices are able to grow successively ( details in sec .",
    "[ turbulence ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the drag force can not be calculated from the simulations of hnninen _ _ et al.__@xcite in the manner of the present study , since our method assumes an equilibrium state .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows . in sec .",
    "[ formulation ] , we shall clarify the configuration and formulation of the model and introduce the equations of motion required in the dynamics of quantum turbulence .",
    "in sec .  [ turbulence ] , we shall describe the process whereby quantum turbulence is generated by an oscillating object . in sec .",
    "[ drag force ] , we shall introduce the present proposed method of evaluating the drag force on the oscillating object and show the dependency of the drag force on the velocity of the object .",
    "section [ conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusion and the discussion .",
    "superfluid @xmath0he at 0 k can be treated mathematically as an ideal incompressible fluid of vanishing viscosity . in a superfluid ,",
    "any circulation is quantized in units of @xmath13 .",
    "the vorticity is infinitely distributed on thin vortex core , whose size is the order of 1  , so that the circulation around the vortex filament is restricted to @xmath13.@xcite with these features , it is valid to adopt the vortex filament approximation , which regards a vortex as a line .",
    "numerical study of quantum turbulence can be accomplished by solving the equations of motion for the vortex filaments that form the turbulence.@xcite according to helmholtz s theorem , a vortex filament moves with superfluid velocity on the vortex . in an infinite system of superfluid , the superfluid velocity is equal to the velocity generated by vortex filaments , which takes the form of the biot - savart integration , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a position vector on a vortex and the integration is performed over all the vortex lines . in attempting to determine a velocity field at a certain point @xmath16 on a vortex , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : biot - savart ] ) diverges as @xmath17 .",
    "the divergence is evaded by introducing cutoff parameter @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : biot - savart ] ) .    in the presence of a boundary",
    ", additional superflow @xmath19 appears so as to satisfy the boundary condition for an inviscid fluid , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a vector normal to the boundary . while many possible geometries may be considered for the vibrating objects , in the present study we restrict attention to the sphere for simplicity .    for a velocity field generated by an infinitesimal element @xmath22 of a closed - loop vortex , eq .",
    "( [ boundary ] ) is satisfied by considering an image vortex inside the sphere.@xcite",
    "the image vortex consists of two parts : a radial image @xmath23 and a tangential image @xmath24 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : img_vor ] , the origin is set at the center of the sphere , @xmath25 is the radius of the sphere , @xmath26 is a radius vector of the vortex element , @xmath27 is a radial component of @xmath22 , and @xmath28 is a tangential component defined as @xmath29 .",
    "the tangential image is located at @xmath30 from the origin and anti - parallel to @xmath28 .",
    "its length is @xmath31 , and it has circulation @xmath32 .",
    "the radial image directs from @xmath33 to the origin , its length is @xmath30 and it has circulation @xmath34 .    when the sphere moves with the velocity @xmath35 , the boundary condition [ eq .  ( [ boundary ] ) ] is satisfied in a reference frame that moves with the sphere : @xmath36 the extra term in the parenthesis is canceled out by adding the following term to @xmath19 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a flow induced by the motion of the sphere and determined by the instantaneous velocity of the sphere.@xcite thus @xmath19 is obtained by adding the contribution from the image vortices and the velocity field given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : uniform_flow ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of the vortices are completely determined by the above formulation .",
    "when two vortices cross or when a vortex becomes close to a spherical boundary , it is theoretically known that reconnection , which is topological change , occurs.@xcite in the framework of the vortex filament model , the details of the vortex core are neglected , and so these formulations do not describe the dynamics of the reconnection . in the present numerical simulation , an exceptional routine",
    "is included in our numerical code to allow reconnection to occur when a vortex approaches another vortex or a spherical boundary within the numerical resolution.@xcite    it is thought that quantum turbulence originates from remnant vortices rather than from the intrinsic nucleation of vortices.@xcite thus we inject vortex rings toward the oscillating object to induce quantum turbulence , considering the experiment of the osaka group.@xcite this approach using the injection of vortices requires the consideration of two parameters : the ring size and the time interval in which the vortices are injected .",
    "the ring size can be estimated experimentally by the time of flight for the vortex ring , and we utilize the value of the ring size 1 @xmath39m.@xcite we assume that the time interval is smaller than the period of the oscillation , say , 0.05 ms.@xcite in order to replicate the conditions of ref",
    ".  15 , in the present study the same parameter values as this previous study are used , such as the radius of sphere and the oscillation frequency of the sphere .",
    "the diameter of the sphere is 3 @xmath39 m , the frequency of the oscillation is 1590 hz , while the oscillation velocity is chosen in the range of 3090 mm / s .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     table [ tab : cd ] shows the drag coefficient calculated using different time intervals at an oscillation velocity of magnitude 50 mm / s .",
    "as the injection interval becomes shorter , the rate of vortex growth increases , resulting in an increase in the drag coefficient .",
    "however , it may be noted that the drag coefficient remains of order unity .",
    "quantum turbulence was created around an oscillating sphere , and its evolution was studied .",
    "we proposed a method to evaluate the drag force in quantum turbulence .",
    "the drag force was calculated by considering the energy supplied by the sphere , and it is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the oscillation velocity .",
    "this dependency on the velocity is quite similar to that in classical turbulence .",
    "the drag coefficient was also calculated , and its order of magnitude is in agreement with that of the previous experimental results . the similarity between classical and quantum turbulences was confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "we believe that the drag coefficient has an universal value independent of the details of the system .",
    "our future work is to confirm whether the drag coefficient still remains of the order of unity even if the parameters such as the frequency of the oscillation and the geometry of the oscillating object are changed .",
    "the simulations were performed for a smooth sphere , but the objects used in the experiments have surface roughness .",
    "the roughness may increase the drag force and the drag coefficient ; when a vortex is detached from the sphere due to the oscillation , it is likely to leave a small vortex bridge over the pinning sites on the surface .",
    "the small vortex plays a role of `` seed '' for the growth of the vortex , and this is equivalent to injecting more vortices to the sphere , resulting in an increase in the drag force and the drag coefficient .",
    "however , there is no clear way to proceed to obtain the solution of the equations of motion of vortices under the boundary conditions which describe the surface roughness at present , and the numerical simulations require a model that phenomenologically depicts the vortex pinning .",
    "figure [ fig : drag_force ] enables us to discuss the transition from the turbulent to laminar state .",
    "below oscillation velocities of magnitude 50 mm / s , the drag force starts to deviate from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : drag_force ] ) and tends to zero .",
    "this is because the motion of the sphere is so slow that vortices can not be stretched before the attached vortices leave the sphere , resulting in the drag force tending to zero .",
    "this means that the oscillating sphere can no longer sustain turbulence , and that the flow regime will return to a laminar state . from dimensional analysis , the critical velocity",
    "at which turbulence returns to laminar flow is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is constant with the order of unity , and this formulation agrees with the critical velocity in the experiments.@xcite in the simulation , @xmath42 m@xmath43/s , @xmath44 rad / s , and finally one obtains @xmath45 30 mm / s .",
    "this is very close to the velocity 50 mm / s below which the deviation from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : drag_force ] ) starts in the simulation .",
    "therefore the velocity magnitude 50 mm / s can be considered in the simulations to represent the critical velocity magnitude .",
