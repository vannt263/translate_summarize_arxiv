    "in the past decade , one witnessed a surge in newly developing medical imaging modalities .",
    "their designers pursue the lofty goals of increasing the image resolution , contrast , and safety , while reducing the costs .",
    "a new approach evident in some of these developments is based upon combining different physical types of signals in one procedure , with the hope of reducing the deficiencies of each individual one , and at the same time taking advantage of the strengths of each .",
    "the most well developed example is the * thermoacoustic tomography ( tat ) * ( also abbreviated as tct ) @xcite .",
    "let us provide a brief description of the tat procedure ( also see @xcite and @xcite-@xcite ) .    a very short radiofrequency ( rf ) pulse is sent through a biological object .",
    "the whole object is assumed to be uniformly irradiated .",
    "some rf energy is absorbed at each location inside the object .",
    "it is known ( e.g. , @xcite ) that cancerous cells absorb several times more energy in the rf range than the healthy ones .",
    "thus , if we knew the distribution of the absorption of rf energy function @xmath0 , this high contrast could provide an easy identification of cancerous locations .",
    "however , rf waves with sufficient penetration depth are too long to lead to a good resolution , if used for imaging .",
    "thus , a different mechanism is used for imaging @xmath0 .",
    "namely , energy absorption causes thermoelastic expansion of the tissue , which in turn leads to propagation of a pressure wave @xmath1 .",
    "this signal is measured by transducers distributed according to some specifically chosen geometry around the object .",
    "ultrasound imaging has rather low contrast , but in the tat procedure , this is not a problem , since the contrast comes from the electromagnetic absorption , and ultrasound is only responsible for high resolution , which it does have .",
    "thus , recovery of @xmath0 from the measured characteristics of the pressure @xmath1 , is the main goal of tat .",
    "the smallness of the ultrasound contrast is in fact a good thing for tat .",
    "for instance , it has been mostly assumed that the sound speed is constant .",
    "this is the main assumption under which most known mathematical developments have taken place . in many cases , though , it is important to take variable sound speed into account , and we will do so in this paper .",
    "the photoacoustic tomography ( pat ) is almost identical to tat .",
    "the difference is only in how the thermoacoustic signal is generated . in pat ,",
    "a laser pulse is used instead of an rf one to initiate the signal @xcite .",
    "the rest of the procedure stays the same . since from the mathematical point of view",
    ", there is no difference between tat and pat , we will be mentioning tat only .",
    "close attention has been paid to developing mathematical methods required for tat ( almost solely under the constant sound speed assumption ) .",
    "the mathematical problems of tat happen to be very interesting and involving various areas of analysis , in particular pdes , integral geometry , microlocal analysis , and spectral theory .",
    "many of them , however , also are rather complex ( see , e.e . the survey @xcite and references therein ) . after a substantial effort ,",
    "major breakthroughs have occurred in the last couple of years in all relevant issues : uniqueness of reconstruction , inversion formulas and algorithms , range conditions , incomplete data problems , and stability .",
    "the hardest to come about were explicit inversion formulas , as well as some uniqueness of reconstruction results ( albeit , for practical geometries , these can be considered to be resolved @xcite ) .",
    "for quite a while , only series expansions had been available for the case of transducers placed along a sphere @xmath2 surrounding the object @xcite .",
    "no formulas were available for non- spherical surfaces @xmath2 .",
    "the first explicit inversion formulas were obtained in @xcite for the spherical geometry in odd dimensions and then extended to even dimensions in @xcite .",
    "a different ( non - equivalent ) set of formulas was developed for any dimension in @xcite ( see also such a formula in @xmath3 in @xcite ) .",
    "all these formulas are valid for the spherical geometry only .",
    "another drawback of the inversions of @xcite is that if the source @xmath0 extends beyond the observation surface , the reconstruction even of its part that is inside , becomes incorrect ( see discussion of this phenomenon in @xcite ) .",
    "a series expansion formula that involves the spectrum and eigenfunctions of the dirichlet laplacian was obtained in @xcite .",
    "unlike the formulas of @xcite , it applies to any geometry of measurement and also does not assume that the signal comes from the interior of the measurement surface only .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that the eigenfunction expansions method can be implemented to provide fast and accurate reconstructions .",
    "one needs to mention that in the case of the constant sound speed , the reconstruction task can be described as an integral geometry problem dealing with a spherical mean operator @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein for integral geometric methods ) .",
    "this relation with integral geometry all but disappears for non - constant speed .",
    "no explicit inversion formulas are known for non - spherical surfaces or for the case of variable sound speed .",
    "there are also some mysteries surrounding existing formulas .",
    "e.g. , why do explicit formulas reconstruct incorrectly the function inside the observation surface , if the function has a part outside the surface ?",
    "why do inversion formulas exist , even so the general machinery of the so called @xmath4-operator @xcite suggests that one should not expect such formulas to appear ( since one deals with a so called `` inadmissible complex '' ) ?",
    "some of these issues are addressed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to develop a very simple general operator theory inversion formula , which applies to arbitrary geometry of the observation surface ( i.e. , the surface where transducers are placed ) , variable sound speed under a non- trapping condition , and functions not necessarily supported inside the observation surface . since the formula involves functions of the dirichlet laplacian inside @xmath2 , it is not easy to apply .",
    "we show how it works in some special cases .",
    "in particular , it leads to eigenfunction expansion methods that apply in a wider generality ( e.g. , in non- homogeneous media ) than those of @xcite .",
    "one can mention that mathematical problems similar to the ones of tat arise in sonar and radar research ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of the article is a s follows .",
    "the next section [ s : model ] sets up the mathematical formulation of the problem .",
    "then , in section [ s : abstract ] , we obtain the general inversion formulas . for the clarity sake , they are first derived under the assumption of a constant sound speed and for a domain of an arbitrary shape in an odd dimensional space @xmath5 , so the huygens principle holds .",
    "later on , use of the huygens principle is replaced by local energy decay estimates @xcite .",
    "it is also assumed that functions involved are smooth , a restriction that can easily be lifted after the final formulas are derived .",
    "then an abstract result concerning hyperbolic equations in hilbert spaces is derived that generalizes the one presented in this simple example .",
    "this general formula then is applied to the case of reconstruction in tat without assumption of constant sound speed .",
    "what is relevant , is not the uniformity of the background medium , but rather a non - trapping condition .",
    "such a condition is absolutely natural , since without it one can not expect any inverse problems of the kind we study to be reasonably solvable .",
    "we also establish a uniqueness of reconstruction result .",
    "it shows that the data collected is sufficient for recovery of a ( compactly supported ) function , even if its support reaches outside the observation surface ( albeit the inversion procedure recoveres only its interior part ) .",
    "the next section [ s : remarks ] contains additional remarks and discussions .",
    "this is followed by an acknowledgements section .",
    "let the function @xmath0 to be reconstructed be compactly supported in @xmath5 .",
    "let also @xmath2 be a closed surface , at each point @xmath6 of which one places a point detector that measures the value of the pressure @xmath7 at any moment @xmath8 .",
    "it is usually assumed ( and this is crucial for the validity of the formulas of @xcite ) that the object ( and thus the support of @xmath0 ) is surrounded by @xmath2 .",
    "we will not need this assumption here .",
    "we assume that the ultrasound speed @xmath9 is known ( e.g. , being determined by transmission ultrasound measurements @xcite ) .",
    "then , the pressure wave @xmath1 satisfies the following problem for the standard wave equation @xcite : @xmath10 the task is to recover the initial value @xmath0 at @xmath11 of the solution @xmath1 from the measured data , which we will call @xmath12 . incorporating the data obtained from the measurement , the set of equations ( [ e : wave ] ) extends to become @xmath13    [",
    "f : cylinder ]    the problem now is to find the initial value @xmath0 in ( [ e : wave_data ] ) from the knowledge of the lateral data @xmath14 ( see figure [ f : cylinder ] ) .",
    "although at a first glance one might think that we have insufficient data , this is in fact not true . indeed , there is an additional restriction that the solution holds in the whole space , not just inside the cylinder @xmath15 . in most cases , with this additional information , the data is sufficient for recovery of @xmath0 ( see @xcite and references therein for the case of constant speed , and further in this paper for the case of a variable speed under a non - trapping condition ) .",
    "an additional sometimes useful comment ( albeit we are not going to use it ) is that @xmath16 can be extended as an even function of time , after which it will satisfy the wave equation for all values of @xmath17 .",
    "the same applies to the data @xmath18 that can also be extended to an even function in @xmath17 .",
    "we would like to notice that in the case of constant speed , due to the well known poisson - kirchhoff formulas ( * ? ? ?",
    "vi , section 13.2 , formula ( 15 ) ) for the solution of ( [ e : wave ] ) , there is close relation ( essentially , an equivalence ) between this problem and inversion of the spherical mean operator with centers of spheres of integration located on @xmath2 ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references in these papers ) .",
    "this is why many previous considerations dealt with the spherical mean operator rather than the wave equation , which allowed for the well developed techniques ( or at least hints ) of integral geometry to be applied .",
    "we can not relay upon such techniques , since in our case the wave speed is not assumed to be constant .",
    "the standard list of questions one would like to ask in any tomographic problem , includes uniqueness of reconstruction , inversion formulas and algorithms , their stability , incomplete data problems , etc . in this text",
    ", we will address only uniqueness of reconstruction and inversion .",
    "one can find a survey of known results on other issues and a bibliography in @xcite .",
    "in order not to obstacle consideration , we will assume for simplicity that the sound speed @xmath9 and the initial function @xmath0 to be recovered are infinite differentiable , an assumption that can be easily significantly weakened .",
    "the closed _ observation surface _",
    "@xmath2 of transducers locations is assumed to be sufficiently `` nice '' .",
    "e.g. , assuming that it consists of finitely many transversally intersecting smooth pieces ( e.g. , a cube ) , would suffice both for practical applications and for our analytic needs , albeit this condition can be weakened much further .",
    "thus , we will not dwell on this issue .",
    "notice , that unlike the case of all known backprojection type formulas in tat , we do not assume that the function to be reconstructed is supported inside the observation surface @xmath2 , on which the transducers are located .",
    "the truly significant assumptions are the following :    1 .",
    "support of @xmath0 is compact .",
    "the sound speed is strictly positive @xmath19 and such that @xmath20 has compact support , i.e. @xmath21 for large @xmath22 .",
    "3 .   consider the hamiltonian system in @xmath23 with the hamiltonian @xmath24 : @xmath25 the solutions of this system are called _ bicharacteristics _ and their projections into @xmath26 are _",
    "rays_. + we will assume that the * non - trapping condition * holds , i.e. that all rays ( with @xmath27 ) tend to infinity when @xmath28 .    the first assumption is very important , albeit it could be replaced by a sufficiently fast decay . without a sufficiently fast decay condition ,",
    "there is no uniqueness of reconstruction @xcite .",
    "the second condition assumes that the medium outside a bounded domain is homogeneous .",
    "the third one prohibits trapping . if trapping does occur",
    ", then it is naturally expected that solvability of standard inverse problems and problems like controllability should most probably fail .",
    "let us discuss first some peculiarities of the inverse problem of recovering the initial value @xmath0 from the lateral boundary data @xmath14 in ( [ e : wave_data ] ) . as we have mentioned already ,",
    "if there were nothing special about the set - up of this problem ( i.e. , if we were dealing with boundary value problem for the wave equation in the cylinder ) , such an inverse problem would not be uniquely solvable . indeed , the lateral data alone is clearly insufficient .",
    "the special situation is that we are dealing in fact with an _ observability _ problem .",
    "namely , the solution @xmath1 satisfies the wave equation in the whole space , not just inside the surface @xmath2 , albeit we observe the solution on @xmath2 only . since the initial function is compactly supported , and since appropriate non - trapping condition will be imposed , the energy will be locally decaying ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the energy of the solution @xmath16 inside @xmath2 will be decaying",
    ". the rate of this decay is different in odd and even dimensions ( @xcite ) , exponential in the odd and power in the even case . in both cases ,",
    "the solution is summable with respect to time as a function in appropriate functional spaces in the domain @xmath29 bounded by @xmath2 .",
    "we will see that this influences the solvability of the problem significantly .",
    "we start with the simplest case when the dimension @xmath30 is odd and the sound speed is constant and equal to @xmath31 .",
    "we also assume here that the initial function @xmath0 is smooth and compactly supported . then both the solution @xmath1 and the boundary data @xmath32 are smooth and , due to huygens principle , compactly supported in time , when @xmath33 . here",
    "we denote by @xmath29 the interior domain of @xmath2 .",
    "let now @xmath34 be the operator of harmonic extension of functions from @xmath2 to @xmath29 , which , due to standard regularity theorems , is continuous from @xmath35 to @xmath36 for any @xmath37 .",
    "then we can rewrite the problem ( [ e : wave_data ] ) in terms of the function @xmath38 : @xmath39 in particular , if the initial function is supported strictly inside @xmath29 ( which we do not need to assume ) , then @xmath40 , and thus @xmath41 .",
    "let us now denote by @xmath42 the dirichlet laplacian in @xmath29 , defined in the standard way as an unbounded self - adjoint operator in @xmath43 .",
    "[ t : main_simplified ] the following representation of @xmath44 holds : @xmath45 in particular , @xmath46    first of all , the integral in ( [ e : general_simplified ] ) makes sense , since @xmath47 is an uniformly bounded strongly continuous operator function in @xmath43 and @xmath48 is a smooth compactly supported function of @xmath17 with values in @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath49 be the spectrum and an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions of @xmath50 , where we assume @xmath51 .",
    "we introduce notations @xmath52 for the fourier coefficients of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , with respect to the system @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 denotes the scalar product in @xmath43 .",
    "it is sufficient to prove ( [ e : general_simplified ] ) coupled with any eigenfunction @xmath58 : @xmath59 using self - adjointness of @xmath60 and the eigenfunction property of @xmath58 , this simplifies to @xmath61 it is easy to check that the right hand side in ( [ e : expanded2 ] ) is the unique solution vanishing at infinity of the equation @xmath62 however , ( [ e : wave_expanded ] ) coincides with the projection of ( [ e : wave_modified ] ) onto the eigenfunction @xmath58 . since the system of eigenfunctions is complete in @xmath43 , this proves the theorem .",
    "let us now try to remove the appearance of the extension operator @xmath34 .",
    "in order to do so , we introduce the fourier coefficients of the data : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the external normal to @xmath2 .",

    "[ c : better_smoothness ] the statement of the theorem with the third of the coefficient formulas in ( [ e : coef_represent2 ] ) holds under much milder conditions on the function @xmath0 .",

    "indeed , one can approximate such a function @xmath53 in the space @xmath77 by functions from @xmath78 , thus getting convergence of the data @xmath32 in @xmath79 . then the third formula in ( [ e : coef_represent2 ] )",
    "extends by continuity .",
    "it is not hard to establish an abstract analog of theorems [ t : main_simplified ] and [ t : series_wave ] .",

    "the function @xmath54 and its derivative tend to zero when @xmath85 : @xmath86 2 .",

    "the proof repeats the proofs of theorems [ t : main_simplified ] and [ t : series_wave ] .",
    "let us consider now the tat problem ( [ e : wave_data ] ) in the presence of an inhomogeneous background , assuming the conditions imposed on the sound speed @xmath9 in the beginning of section [ s : abstract ] .",
    "using the same harmonic extension trick as in the section [ ss : odd ] , we get @xmath96 consider the hilbert space @xmath97 , i.e. , the weighted @xmath98 space with the weight @xmath99 . on this space ,",
    "the naturally defined operator @xmath100 in @xmath29 with zero dirichlet conditions on @xmath2 is self - adjoint , positive , and has discrete spectrum @xmath101 with eigenfunctions @xmath102 .",
    "now , since we are in fact dealing with the unobstacled whole space wave propagation ( the surface @xmath2 is not truly a boundary , but just an observation surface ) and since we assumed the sound speed constant at infinity and non - trapping , the local energy decay type estimates of @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.104 ) ) apply .",
    "they , in combination with the standard sobolev trace theorems , imply in particular that the conditions of theorem [ t : abstract ] both on @xmath103 and @xmath104 are satisfied .",
    "we thus get the following    [ t : main_speed ]    1 .   the function @xmath0 in ( [ e : wave_variable ] ) , and thus in ( [ e : wave_data ] )",

    "the only thing that might have been different is deriving the fourier coefficient representations ( [ e : coef_variable2 ] ) by coupling the expression @xmath109 with @xmath58 in ( [ e : reconstruction_variable ] ) in the weighted @xmath98 space .",

    "+ theorem [ t : uniqueness ] guarantees unique recovery of any compactly supported function @xmath0 , even if its support is not confined to @xmath29 .",
    "however , microlocal arguments show that reconstruction should become unstable for some parts of @xmath53 outside the observation surface @xmath2 .",
    "this is related to the existence in this case of the so called `` visible '' or `` audible '' zones of the wave front set of @xmath0 , as well as those that are not `` visible '' ( `` audible '' ) @xcite .",

    "albeit this might not be clear from the text of this paper , what has led the authors to this work , was an approach through the range conditions of the spherical mean operator described in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the line of thought was that the whole possibility of inversion is based upon a very special type of the boundary data @xmath18 involved . as we have already explained , using arbitrary functions as the data @xmath18 would lead to impossibility of reconstruction .",
    "thus , the basis of our approach was to use our knowledge of the special features of the data @xmath18 to derive inversions . it can be shown ( albeit we do not do this in this text ) that decay with time of solutions inside @xmath29 is directly linked ( in the case of constant sound speed ) to the range descriptions of @xcite . continuing this consideration",
