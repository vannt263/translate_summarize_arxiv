    "precise cross - sections of secondary hadron production from the interactions of protons and pions with nuclei are , _ inter alia _ , of importance for the improvement and physics validation of hadron generation models in monte carlo simulation tool kits such as geant4  @xcite .",
    "the harp detector at the cern ps took data in 2001 and 2002 with proton and pion beams with momentum from 1.5 to 15  gev/_c _ , with a set of stationary targets ranging from hydrogen to lead , including beryllium .",
    "the detector combined a forward spectrometer with a large - angle spectrometer .",
    "the latter comprised a cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc ) around the target and an array of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) that surrounded the tpc .",
    "the purpose of the tpc was track reconstruction and particle identification by .",
    "the purpose of the rpcs was to complement the particle identification by time of flight .",
    "this paper reports comparisons of geant4 predictions with data from the interactions with a 5% @xmath2 beryllium target of @xmath0  gev/_c _ protons and @xmath3 s , and of @xmath1  gev/_c _",
