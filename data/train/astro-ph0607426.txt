    "the analysis of peculiar velocity fields of galaxies and clusters is one of the most effective ways of probing mass fluctuations on @xmath6 100 h@xmath1 mpc scales ( h being the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 ) .",
    "studies of peculiar velocities can be used to constrain the amplitude of mass power spectrum on scales others than those probed by redshift surveys and those sampled by anisotropies in the cmb ( e.g. zaroubi et al . ; 2001 ; freudling et al .",
    "originally motivated by the invention of distance indicators based on intrinsic relations between galaxy observables @xcite that are _ independent of redshift _ , the field has , in recent years , experienced great progress toward constructing large and homogeneous redshift - distance samples of galaxies and clusters . although the analyses of early redshift - distance surveys of spiral galaxies @xcite and of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , lynden - bell at al .",
    "1988 ) led to the development of several statistical methods for analyzing peculiar velocity data @xcite , these studies were hampered by the fact that they were based on relatively small and shallow data sets .",

    "based on the work of kaiser ( 1988 ) , feldman & watkins ( 1994 ) formulated a linear analysis to calculate the theoretical expectation for bulk flow in large - scale surveys as a function of the geometry of the survey , its clustering properties , and the assumed power spectrum ; and applied it to a volume - limited complete sample of 119 abell clusters ( lauer & postman 1994 , hereafter lp ) to show that the power spectra considered were inconsistent with the lp measurement of bulk flow at the 95@xmath9 - 97@xmath9 confidence level .",
    "the formalism was later applied @xcite to calculate a measure of correlation between results obtained from the riess , press , & kirshner ( 1995a , 1995b , hereafter rpk ) and the lp samples .",
    "they found that the apparent lack of agreement between the two measurements could be explained by the fact that both the lp and rpk samples were dominated by noise and incomplete cancellation of small scale motions .",

    "further , we construct the 3-dimensional bulk flow vectors for all the surveys mentioned above and calculate the actual dot products of the estimates of the bulk flows obtained from these surveys in order to discuss their consistency . in @xmath16 2 ,",

    "a catalog of peculiar velocities consists of a set of galaxies , labeled by an index n , for which we are given positions @xmath47 and estimates of the line - of - sight peculiar velocities @xmath48 with uncertainties @xmath49 . for simplicity",
    ", we will make the assumption that observational errors are gaussian distributed .",
    "since linear theory only applies on scales comparable to the survey size , we focus our attention on the lowest order moments of a taylor expansion of the velocity field @xmath21 . following kaiser ( 1988 ) , we model the velocity field as a uniform streaming motion , or bulk flow , denoted by @xmath50 , about which are random motions drawn from a gaussian distribution with a 1d velocity dispersion @xmath51 .",
    "although this model ignores the fact that small - scale motions , including those that are nonlinear , are correlated , it is reasonable to assume that they effectively average out on the scales we are considering . since the value of @xmath51 is not well determined by linear theory , we will treat it as a parameter with a fixed value of 300 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we have checked that our results are fairly insensitive to the exact value chosen for this parameter . given these assumptions ,",
    "the likelihood function for the bulk flow components is @xmath52 where here and in subsequent equations repeated indices are summed over . the maximum likelihood solution for the @xmath53th component of the bulk flow",
    "is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 thus u@xmath56 is the cross - correlation between the estimated line - of - sight velocity of the @xmath57-th galaxy and its position vector .",
    "for the catalogs considered , @xmath58 is nearly diagonal , the off - diagonal terms being of order 10@xmath9 of the diagonal ones .    in the model we are considering ,",
    "the measured peculiar velocity of galaxy @xmath57 is related to the velocity field at the position of galaxy @xmath57 by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is drawn from a gaussian with zero mean and variance @xmath61 .",
    "the fact that @xmath60 is statistically independent of the velocity allows the theoretical covariance matrix for the bulk flow components to be written as @xcite @xmath62 where the `` noise '' term can be shown to be @xcite @xmath63 and the  theoretical \" term can be written as the convolution of an angle - averaged tensor window function with the power spectrum @xmath64 where @xmath65    our main goal in this _ paper _ is to figure out whether the surveys we consider are consistent with one another .",
    "however , even if two surveys are measuring the same underlying velocity field , they will not necessarily give the same bulk flow .",
    "this is both due to measurement errors in the peculiar velocities and the fact that each survey probes the velocity field in a different way .",
    "this is most clearly seen by observing that each survey has different window functions ( see below ) .",
    "in order to get an idea of how much correlation is expected between the estimates of the components of the bulk flows @xmath66 and @xmath67 of any pair of surveys ( a , b ) for a given power spectrum , we can calculate the correlation matrix @xmath68 for the two surveys .",
    "this is calculated in a similar manner to the covariance matrix , except that the two sums in the window function are now over two different surveys @xmath69    the correlation matrix can then be used to calculate the normalized expectation value for the dot product of @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the angle between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath72 should be close to unity for highly correlated vectors , zero for vectors that are completely uncorrelated , and 1 if there is a high degree of anti - correlation .",
    "it is important to realize that @xmath72 carries information only about the correlation of the _ directions _ of the bulk flow vectors of the two surveys ; however , it provides a convenient measure of how well the large scale velocity information contained in two surveys agree .    given a value of @xmath73 for two surveys ( a , b ) calculated using a given power spectrum , we can estimate the probability that the bulk flow vectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 will be separated by an angle greater than some @xmath74 .",
    "our strategy is to think of the direction of @xmath66 as scattering about the direction of @xmath67 in a two - dimensional space where @xmath71 is the radial distance .",
    "thus we can take @xmath71 to have a @xmath75 distribution with two degrees of freedom @xmath76 the probability of measuring a value for @xmath71 greater than @xmath74 is then @xmath77 we can estimate the value of @xmath78 by using the fact that @xmath79 for small @xmath71 . since our @xmath80 distribution has the property that @xmath81 , we can estimate @xmath82 this analysis ignores the small anisotropy in the covariance matrices for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , but should be sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the formalism described above can be employed to test the consistency of all velocity field surveys . in this study , we have considered the following proper distance catalogs : +    )    _ spiral field i - band ( sfi ) _ :",

    "the mark iii catalogs provide the observables for each object ( i.e. redshift , magnitude , velocity width ) and inferred distances derived from both the forward and inverse tf or @xmath86 relations .",
    "distances for both individual objects and groups are provided .",
    "the singles catalog has 2538 galaxies , while the group catalog has 1124 groups .",
    "the total survey depth is over 100 h@xmath1 mpc with homogeneous sky coverage to @xmath87 h@xmath1 mpc .",
    "the most important point to note here is that the above surveys are by and large independent of each other .",
    "they use different distance indicators , selection functions and survey geometries , and target different morphology of galaxies .",
    "further , since our formalism weighs the galaxy contribution by the distance error , we do not expect distant galaxies to contribute much to our results and thus , the homogeneous malmquist bias correction will not change our outcome , ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as for the inhomogeneous malmquist bias ( imb ) , since redshift distances are not affected , it will result in scattering the distances away from overdensities , leading to an appearance of an infall .",
    "this effect should not affect the bulk flow , though it may contribute to higher order moments .",
    "if we had found disagreement between the surveys , it would be very important to estimate the magnitude of the imb since it may be the cause of the disagreement . since we found agreement ,",
    "then it is likely that the imb is smaller than our errors , since it was not sufficient to cause disagreement even though one would expect each survey to have a different bias .",
    "that said , we have conducted the following experiment : we have cut all galaxies above a certain radius ( for radii @xmath88 mpc ) and performed the analysis described above . removing far away",
    "galaxies did not change the results significantly and the direction of the flow for these radii was within a standard deviation of the results quoted in this _",
    "paper_. these results are expected , since the galaxies are distance - error - weighted and thus , galaxies close to the edge of the surveys contribute relatively little to the overall flow .",
    "we thus confirm our expectation that prominent features close to the edge of the surveys ( e.g. pieces - perseus region ) do not produce a spurious imb bulk motion and systematically bias our results .",
    "we now present the estimates of the actual bulk flow vectors for all the different surveys .",
    "we use eq .",

    "the uncertainties given for the bulk flow values in table 1 are obtained from the noise part of the covariance matrix , @xmath89 ( eq . [ eq - rije ] ) .",
    "since @xmath89 is nearly diagonal for all of the surveys , we took the uncertainties in the @xmath90 to be approximately independent , so that the uncertainties are taken to be @xmath91 .",
    "these uncertainties are dominated by measurement errors in the individual velocities , although they also have small contributions from @xmath51 and cosmic scatter .",

    "however , as we move away from the center , each survey samples the underlying power differently .",
    "]    each catalog surveys a different volume of space , it samples a small subset of the underlying population of galaxies , and uses independent spatial sampling techniques . since the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales and the sample volumes of the various data sets",

    "the value of the combined bulk flow vector was calculated by weighing the results by their errors , finding the weighted mean of the values for each survey .",

    "this study clearly supports the notion that we have reached an era where velocity field data is consistent and robust across morphological types , selection criteria , survey geometry etc .",
    "results from independent catalogs probe the same underlying large  scale power , though are subjected to different small  scale fluctuations . unlike earlier , sparser surveys ,",
    "the newer proper  distance surveys provide us with a dynamical probe of the large  scale structure which we can add to our growing arsenal of data with confidence that the results reflect the cosmology we probe .",
