    "entanglement is a key resource in quantum information processing @xcite , which has been intensively investigated in microscopic systems , such as cavity - qed @xcite .",
    "macroscopic entanglement is a research field full of curiosity , and quantum optomechanical system is now considered to be useful for its investigation @xcite . generally speaking , the degree of entanglement is usually small ( logarithmic negativity @xmath0 ) near the zero temperature .",
    "it can not be obtained under room - temperature due to the stability conditions and the thermal noise of the mechanical modes .",
    "recently highly entangled quantum states ( logarithmic negativity @xmath1 near the zero temperature ) in optomechanical system are discussed via various methods , such as cascaded cavity coupling @xcite , reservoir engineering @xcite , bogoliubov dark mode @xcite , srensen - mlmer approach @xcite and coherent feedback @xcite .",
