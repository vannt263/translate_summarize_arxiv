    "the modified version of this relation obtained by multiplying the integrands in both the spectral and ope representations of @xmath8 by the factor @xmath50 is called `` the @xmath51 spectral weight sum rule ''  @xcite .",

    "the existence of such a window of @xmath48 values is , of course , crucial to the reliability of such a determination .",
    "we will concentrate on three analyses of this type below .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the issue of duality violation , and the closely related issue of the determination of @xmath1 , using the very precise @xmath3 v+a spectral data . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss some complications , and the current status , of attempts to extract @xmath2 from the flavor - breaking difference of @xmath3 and @xmath4 v+a correlators . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss some recent work on the determination of the dimension @xmath55 term in the ope of the @xmath3 v - a correlator .",
    "this quantity bears a special relation to the chiral limit values of the @xmath6 electroweak penguin ( ewp ) operator matrix elements , and hence to expectations for the value of @xmath7 in the standard model .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we consider what improvements in these determinations may be possible in the near future .",
    "for very large @xmath48 , the ope is expected to provide a reliable representation of hadronic correlators over the entire circle @xmath56 in the complex @xmath45-plane . for such @xmath48 , the corresponding spectral",
    "function , @xmath57 , will also be well - represented by its ope form .",
    "this is conventionally referred to as the regime of the validity of `` local duality '' ( ld ) .",
    "as one moves to lower @xmath48 , the arguments of poggio , quinn and weinberg  @xcite suggest that the ope will break down first for those @xmath45 on @xmath56 near the timelike real axis .",
    "we thus expect there to exist a regime of `` intermediate '' scales , @xmath48 , for which the ope , while not reliable near the timelike real axis , continues to be reliable over most of the rest of the circle @xmath56 .",
    "we will refer to the scales for which this is true as the regime of the validity of `` semi - local duality '' ( sld ) . eventually , for sufficiently small @xmath48",
    ", we expect the ope to become unreliable over the whole of the circle @xmath56 .",
    "were all @xmath58 to lie in this final regime , it would be impossible to use hadronic @xmath0 decay data to determine parameters appearing in the ope ; it is therefore important to verify that some of the scales kinematically accessible in @xmath0 decay lie , at the very least , in the region of validity of sld .",
    "the flavor @xmath3 v , a and v+a correlators provide an excellent laboratory for studying the nature of duality violation .",
    "the reason is that , for scales @xmath59 , the ope for these correlators is completely dominated by the @xmath60 term , which is known to @xmath61  @xcite . since @xmath1 is measured with good accuracy at the @xmath62 scale and the qcd @xmath63-function is known to @xmath64-loop order  @xcite , so that @xmath1 can be run down reliably to scales below @xmath65 , the ope in these cases is known with good accuracy down to scales significantly below @xmath54 .",
    "one can , therefore , compare the spectral and ope integrals for various fser weight choices and determine the extent to which the ope provides a good representation of the spectral integral data .",

    "the size of the vsa @xmath5 contribution is quite small , so the conservative error on @xmath82 has little impact on the full theory errors , which are dominated by the uncertainty in @xmath87 and the estimated truncation error .",

    "indeed , the ope and spectral integrals for fesr s based on the weights @xmath89 ( which do not suppress contributions from the vicinity of the timelike real axis ) are in rather poor agreement .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 , which displays the ope - to - spectral - integral - ratio ( which should be @xmath13 if ld is valid ) as a function of @xmath48 , for @xmath90 .",
    "also shown are the corresponding results for the @xmath3 v+a combination .",
    "one can see that the level of duality violation in the v+a correlator is much smaller than that in the v and a correlators separately .",

    "( [ kinematicfesr ] ) , ( whose `` kinematic '' weight , @xmath93 , is a linear combination of the four @xmath91-weighted fesr s shown in figure 1 ) is known to be in good agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "the difference has to do with the form of the weight : because the point @xmath94 , where the circle @xmath95 crosses the timelike real axis , lies at the edge of hadronic phase space , @xmath96 has a ( double ) zero at @xmath94 .",
    "this zero suppresses ope contributions from the part of the integration region near the timelike real axis where use of the ope is expected to be potentially most problematic .",
    "it is presumably this feature of @xmath96 which is responsible for the success of the @xmath92 fesr .",
    "if , as this argument suggests , the success of the @xmath92 fesr is a reflection of the localization of the breakdown of the ope to the vicinity of the timelike real axis for scales @xmath97 , then other fesr s with suppressions of ope contributions from this region should also be well satisfied .",
    "this hypothesis was tested in ref .",
    "fesr s for the v channel were considered for a range of @xmath48 different from @xmath54 , and a range of alternate weights , @xmath43 , still satisfying @xmath98    we refer to such weights as `` pinched '' weights , and the fesr s based on them as `` pinched fesr s '' , or pfesr s . the natural variable for use in such pfesr s is @xmath99 .    .",
    "the resulting pfesr s were all found to be well satisfied for all @xmath100 .",
    "this suppression of duality violations , which is a generic feature of weights of the forms @xmath101 having either a single or double zero at @xmath102 ( where @xmath103 is a free parameter ) can , in favorable cases ( including that of the kinematic weight ) , extend to much smaller @xmath48 .",

    "the @xmath105 pfesr receives no contributions from the @xmath5 ope term and hence has reduced ope errors at low @xmath48 .",
    "the absence of duality violation in this case extends to very low @xmath48 , despite the fact that the weight has only a single zero at @xmath102 .",
    "( 7.4,7.4 )    ( 7.4,7.4 )    [ figure:2 ]    the results above provide a specific illustration of the dangers of attempting to extract ope parameters from a sum rule analysis at intermediate scales when duality violations are present .",
    "were one to take a typical scale @xmath58 and `` extract '' @xmath107 by matching the ope and spectral sides of one of the @xmath91-weighted fesr s , one would find a value which , when run up to higher scales , failed to agree with that obtained in direct measurements , for example , at the z scale . in this case",
    "we do not actually need to know the high - scale value beforehand in order to expose the presence of duality violation : the @xmath48-dependence of the @xmath108 extracted at different @xmath48 , but using the same @xmath91 weight , can been seen to be in very poor agreement with that predicted by 4-loop running in qcd .",
    "similar `` internal '' tests can be performed for any fesr .",
    "passing such a test is of course a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for demonstrating the absence of duality violations in the analysis in question .",
    "let us now turn to @xmath1 . in order to reduce the difficult - to - quantify theoretical systematic error associated with possible residual duality violations , it is useful to work with correlators which display a reduced level of duality violation to begin with .",
    "the results of figure 1 show that the @xmath3 v+a combination is favored in this regard    this combination also has reduced @xmath5 contributions on the ope side , and reduced errors for @xmath109 on the experimental side .    .",
    "similarly , pfesr s are favored over their unpinched analogues at intermediate scales such as those forced on us by @xmath0 decay kinematics . since there is still significant uncertainty in the value of the gluon condensate , which dominates the non - perturbative corrections on the ope side , it is useful to work with pfesr weights which strongly suppress the @xmath110 contribution ( eq .",
    "( [ doublepinch ] ) with @xmath111 and eq .",
    "( [ singlepinch ] ) with @xmath112 ) .",
    "bearing in mind the necessity of using the data not only to extract @xmath1 , but also to verify that duality violations are not obviously present , the following procedure seems optimally conservative .",
    "we first extract @xmath1 using the @xmath104 pfesr at @xmath113 . a weight with a double zero and the highest possible value for @xmath48 are chosen to increase the likelihood that duality violation will be negligible .",
    "neglect of the @xmath88 ope contribution ( which is not suppressed by any factor of @xmath1 for this weight choice , but which scales as @xmath114 ) is also most reliable for the highest possible @xmath48 . using the contour improved peturbation theory ( cipt ) scheme  @xcite for the @xmath60 contribution , the result is @xmath115 where experimental and theoretical errors have been combined in quadrature .",
    "if instead of cipt one employs fixed order perturbation theory ( fopt ) , the central value is reduced to @xmath116    fopt involves an expansion in @xmath107 , cipt a summing of logs point - by - point around the integration contour by the scale choice @xmath117 .    .",
    "the method , and results , are similar to those of earlier analyses  @xcite .",
    "having extracted @xmath1 using only one pfesr , and one value of @xmath48 , we can then use other pfesr s and other @xmath48 values to check for possible duality violation and/or the presence of neglected higher dimension contributions    contributions to the ope side from terms of dimension @xmath118 scale as @xmath119 , allowing one to distinguish contamination by an operator neglected when it should not have been , at least if one considers the data integrals over a sufficiently large window of @xmath48 values .    .",
    "here we compare the ope predictions ( obtained using the value of @xmath1 just extracted ) to the corresponding data integrals for ( 1 ) @xmath104 ( at @xmath58 ) and ( 2 ) @xmath120 ( also as a function of @xmath48 ) .",
    "the @xmath48 dependence of the ope prediction depends crucially on the form of the 4-loop running of @xmath1 .",
    "the results of the tests for possible duality violation are shown in figure 3 .",
    "there is no evidence of such violations , within experimental errors , even down to rather low scales . while this does not prove that they are absent , it does gives us additional confidence in the fit value , eq .",

    "( 7.6,7.6 )    [ figure:3 ]    we conclude this section with a comment on the use of higher degree spectral weights for analyses of the type described above .",
    "weights with degrees @xmath121 in principle involve ope contributions with @xmath122 .",
    "usually these contributions are assumed to be negligible , at least for @xmath113 .",
    "although the values of the relevant condensate combinations are not known for the @xmath3 v+a correlator , the analogous v - a combinations have been extracted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if we take these as representative of the scale of higher @xmath123 contributions for the v+a correlator , we can make a rough estimate of the expected size of higher @xmath123 contributions , and hence determine the likelihood that neglect of such contributions is safe .",
    "for the @xmath124 spectral weight , @xmath104 , this yields an estimate of @xmath125 of the ope total for @xmath113 , making neglect of such contributions quite safe . for the @xmath126 spectral weight , @xmath127 , the estimated @xmath128 contributions , at @xmath113 ,",
    "are both @xmath129 of the ope total , while for the @xmath130 spectral weight , @xmath131 , the estimated @xmath113 @xmath132 contributions are @xmath133 and @xmath134 of the ope total , respectively .",
    "because of the growth in the size of the relevant polynomial coefficients , the neglect of unknown higher @xmath123 contributions thus becomes progressively less safe as one goes to higher spectral weights .",
    "the @xmath60 ( mass - independent ) part of the perturbative contribution to the flavor - breaking difference @xmath135 ( q^2)$ ] vanishes in the @xmath136 flavor limit .",
    "the formally leading ( in dimension ) term in the ope of @xmath137 is therefore the @xmath138 term resulting from flavor breaking in the @xmath139-dependent perturbative contributions . to the extent that @xmath140  @xcite , this contribution is proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "the basic idea of using hadronic @xmath0 decay data to determine @xmath2 is then to construct flavor - breaking differences of @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectral integrals and equate these , using the basic fesr relation , to equivalent ope contour integrals involving the unknown parameter @xmath2 .",
    "a simple way to construct such flavor - breaking differences is to note that , from eq .",
    "( [ taukinspectral ] ) , the @xmath3 decay distribution , rescaled by @xmath142 , and the @xmath4 decay distribution , rescaled by @xmath143 , become equal in the @xmath144 limit .",
    "weighted integrals of the difference of the rescaled spectral functions then produce flavor - breaking observables of the type amenable to a pfesr extraction of @xmath2 .",
    "such differences can , in principle , be constructed separately for v , a and v+a combinations , and also separately for @xmath29 , @xmath30 . since",
    "the v / a separation has not been performed for the @xmath4 spectrum , and even for the @xmath3 spectrum the v+a spectral distribution is better determined than are the separate v and a distributions , it is preferable to work with the v+a combinations for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "bearing in mind that a @xmath145 spin separation is not currently available above @xmath146 in the @xmath4 channel ( where the @xmath12 spectral contributions to the experimental decay distributions may not be totally negligible ) the natural choices for flavor - breaking observables are those constructable from the kinematically - weighted combinations , @xmath147 $ ] , which are determined directly from the experimental @xmath33 and @xmath4 decay distributions .",
    "most analyses in the literature have employed the @xmath148 spectral weight versions of this construction , @xmath149 where @xmath150 the approach to determining @xmath2 just outlined , though straightforward in principle , turns out to have non - trivial complications .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the first complication is the limited accuracy of the current determination of the @xmath4 spectral distribution ( known to @xmath151 in the @xmath41 region , and to @xmath152 above @xmath153  @xcite ) .",
    "this situation will improve dramatically as analyses of the @xmath0 decay data from the b factory experiments begin to come online .",
    "the second complication arises from the rather close cancellation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 contributions occuring on the spectral sides of the flavor - breaking pfesr s employed in the literature ( typically to the @xmath154 or less level ) .",
    "such close cancellation makes the @xmath3-@xmath4 spectral difference sensitive to both uncertainties in @xmath155 and ( apparently ) small changes in the measured @xmath4 branching fraction .",
    "for example , with @xmath3-@xmath4 cancellation to the @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) level , the @xmath158 uncertainty in the value of @xmath155  @xcite translates into a @xmath159 ( @xmath160 uncertainty in the value of the integrated @xmath3-@xmath4 spectral difference .",
    "the small differences beween the preliminary aleph determination @xmath161  @xcite , the final published version , @xmath162  @xcite , and davier s update at tau2000 , @xmath163  @xcite , also produce significant shifts in the central value of @xmath2 extracted in a given pfesr analysis for the same reason .",
    "table 1 displays the central values of @xmath2 obtained in a number of independent analyses reported in the literature , all nominally based on the `` same '' ( aleph ) @xmath4 data .",
    "also shown are the central values employed for the input quantities @xmath164 and @xmath165",
    ". the entries are labelled by their analysis type .",

    "the hadronic @xmath0 decay data base will increase significantly with the data from cleo - c , the new b factory experiments and ( eventually ) the beijing @xmath0-charm factory . in this section",
    "the question of what improvements in the determinations discussed above are likely to be made possible by this new data is briefly discussed .",
    "regarding @xmath1 , it appears unlikely that significant further improvement can be made since the dominant error , even with the existing data , is theoretical , associated with the truncation of the @xmath60 series  @xcite .",
    "this shows up in the direct estimates of the truncation error based on variations in the unknown @xmath170 term in the @xmath60 part of the adler function and/or the renormalization scale , and also in the deviations between the solutions for @xmath1 obtained using different methods of handling the truncated @xmath60 series    the cipt scheme is based on the truncation of the adler function at fixed order , followed by integration around the contour @xmath56 , the fopt scheme on the expansion of the integrated adler function to fixed order in @xmath107 . since the integral of @xmath171^k$ ] can be written as a series in @xmath107 beginning at order @xmath106 , the two schemes differ by terms higher order in @xmath107 .",
    "the difference between the results @xmath172 and @xmath173 , obtained from the cipt and fopt treatments of the same pfesr , at the same value of @xmath48 , thus provides one estimate for the size of the truncation error .",
    "the situation is quite different for @xmath2 , where significant progress can be expected in the near future .",
    "the b factory data should drastically reduce the errors on the @xmath4 spectral distribution .",
    "in addition to the obvious advantage of producing a reduction in the size of the errors on @xmath2 for existing analyses , such improvements should also make possible the use of alternate sum rules not practically useful at present because of the size of the spectral integral errors when evaluated with current data .    this latter point may be relevant to improving less - than - optimal features of existing analyses .",
    "an example is the current sensitivity to @xmath165 . at present , the large @xmath4 experimental errors above the @xmath41 force one to work with weights which strongly suppress the high-@xmath45 part of the spectrum .",
    "these weights turn out to produce a rather high level of @xmath3-@xmath4 cancellation , and hence a significant sensitivity to @xmath165 .",
    "it is likely that , with improved data , the reduction in the level of high-@xmath45 suppressions required will allow the construction of alternate weights with a reduced level of @xmath3-@xmath4 cancellation .",
    "an important point to be stressed regarding the extraction of @xmath2 is that , given the sizeable theoretical systematic problems associated with the behavior of the ope representation of the longitudinal @xmath4 contributions , the inclusive spectral weight analysis method should almost certainly be abandoned .",
    "there are two ways to deal with the longitudinal subtraction that must be made if one wishes pursue sum rules based on the @xmath174 correlator .",
    "one is the theoretical approach outlined above .",
    "note that the continuum longitudinal subtraction does not need to be known to very high accuracy since it actually has little impact on the @xmath174 sum rules , at least for the weights studied so far in the literature .",
    "for example , using the @xmath175 and @xmath176 decay constants extracted from the sum rule analyses of the scalar and pseudoscalar channels  @xcite to make the subtraction , one finds that the shift in the values of the @xmath174 spectral integrals induced by the subtraction is less than @xmath177 for @xmath48 in the range @xmath100 , even for the least rapidly falling of the @xmath174 weights employed in the literature ( the @xmath124 spectral weight ) .",
    "thus even a @xmath178 uncertainty in the longitudinal subtraction corresponds to an error vastly smaller than that associated with the use of the badly - behaved longitudinal ope representation .",
    "the second approach is experimental , and likely to be feasible , at least to some extent , with the new b factory data . if current theoretical estimates for the @xmath176 decay constant  @xcite are correct , the @xmath179 branching fraction should be @xmath180 ( a factor of @xmath181 smaller than the current experimental upper bound ) , a level which may be reachable in the new b factory experiments . since the @xmath176 decays essentially entirely to @xmath182 ,",
    "the only experimental complication ( apart from rate ) is the @xmath183 @xmath182 branch of the @xmath184 .",
    "based on the central value of the aleph determination , @xmath185 , one would expect a @xmath182 background in the @xmath176 region at the @xmath186 level , and with a width somewhat smaller than that of the @xmath176 .",
    "the @xmath187 mode appears less amenable to experimental identification ; confirmation of the theoretical estimates for the @xmath176 decay constant would , however , serve as strong evidence in favor of the corresponding @xmath175 decay constant estimate .",
    "even an upper bound on @xmath188 at the @xmath186 level would be useful since the impact of the longitudinal subtraction on the @xmath174 @xmath2 extraction , at the predicted level for the two decay constants , is already known to be small .",
    "it is thus likely that the uncertainty in the impact of the longitudinal subtraction can be made rather small _ experimentally _ in the near future .    regarding the @xmath6 matrix elements of the ewp operators , the main improvement to be hoped for",
    "is reduced errors in the @xmath3 v - a spectral function in the region above @xmath65 .",
    "this would require an improved v / a separation of the contributions to states containing a @xmath189 pair .",
    "such an improvement might be possible with the enhanced statistics expected from the b factory experiments , at least for quasi - two - body modes .",
    "a reduction of the errors on the v - a spectral function would allow one not only to reduce the errors on the extracted ewp matrix elements , but also to sharpen tests for the absence of duality violation .",
    "recall that both the @xmath3 v and a correlators display , in general , significant duality violation for @xmath58 .",
    "since the v and a duality violations largely cancel in the v+a sum , the intrinsic level of duality violation in the v - a correlator must be expected to be large .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite tests for the presence of such violations in the pfesr s employed , and finds none , within experimental errors , for @xmath48 above @xmath190 .",
    "the larger errors in the upper part of the @xmath48 window , however , leave room for improvement in these tests , particularly in the case of the pfesr s employed to extract the @xmath191 contributions needed as input to the hybrid rwm / pfesr version of the analysis .",
    "i would like conclude by acknowledging useful exchanges with andreas hcker and shaomin chen concerning the aleph data tabulation , and especially the work of my collaborators on some of the topics reported here ( joachim kambor on the light quark masses and related issues , and vincenzo cirigliano , john donoghue and gene golowich of the @xmath6 matrix elements of the ewp operators )",
