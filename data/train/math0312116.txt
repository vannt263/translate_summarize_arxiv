    "a banach space @xmath4 is said to be _ very smooth _ if every unit vector has a unique norming element in @xmath5 ( here @xmath4 is being considered as a subspace of @xmath6 under the canonical embedding , see [ s ] ) . in this paper",
    "we study a local version of the notion of ` very smooth space ' by calling a unit vector of @xmath4 a very smooth point if it is also a smooth point of @xmath6 ( recall that a unit vector is a smooth point if it has a unique norming functional in the dual ) .",
    "these notions are related to differentiability of the norm at these points , see [ s ] . in particular for the space of compact operators we will be considering differentiability in the direction of every bounded operator .",

    "motivated by these results , in this paper we study very smooth points of spaces of operators and @xmath8-triples .    to do this we first prove a proposition involving the notion of an @xmath0-ideal that allows us to ` lift ' very smooth points from subspaces .",
    "we use this to show that depending on the ` position ' of an @xmath0-ideal , all smooth points of a banach space can be very smooth .",

    "the @xmath0-ideal condition in the above proposition can not be replaced by ` @xmath0 is an ideal in @xmath4 ' ( we recall from [ gks ] that @xmath27 is an ideal if there is a projection @xmath29 of norm one in the dual such that @xmath62 ) . in [ gi ]",
    "the authors have constructed an example of a banach space @xmath4 and a very smooth point of @xmath4 that is not very smooth in @xmath63 ( @xmath4 is canonically embedded in @xmath63 and hence an ideal ) .    however , for @xmath27 if one assumes that there is a norm - one projection @xmath64 such that ker @xmath65 and @xmath66 is @xmath67-dense in @xmath68 then since under these conditions @xmath69 ( under the canonical embedding , see [ r6 ] ) , we have that a very smooth point of @xmath0 is a smooth point of @xmath4 .    if @xmath70 or @xmath22 has the compact metric approximation property ( cmap ) , then it is easy to see that @xmath71 satisfies the above condition ( see [ r6 ] ) .",

    "to study very smooth points in this set up we use a characterization of very smooth points obtained in [ gi ] , as smooth points for which the unique norming linear functional in @xmath68 is also a point of continuity for the identity map on @xmath68 equipped with the weak@xmath73 and weak topologies on the domain and the range respectively .",

    "since @xmath74 is hahn  banach smooth , @xmath80 is a point of @xmath81 continuity of @xmath82 ( see [ hww ] , lemma  iii.2.14 ) .",
    "we now claim that @xmath80 is a point of @xmath83 continuity of @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath85 be a net converging to @xmath80 in the weak@xmath73-topology of @xmath70 .",
    "clearly the net @xmath86 converges to @xmath80 in the weak@xmath73-topology of @xmath87 . in view of our assumption on @xmath74 ,",
    "this convergence is thus in the weak topology .",
    "also @xmath88 . by the defining property of @xmath29",
    "we get that the net @xmath89 converges to @xmath90 .",
    "now it is easy to see that the net @xmath91 converges to @xmath80 in the weak topology .",
    "hence @xmath2 is a very smooth point of @xmath4 .",
    "we have used the assumption @xmath76 has no smooth points to get a @xmath92 .",
    "thus this hypothesis can also be replaced by @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath74 has property @xmath94 of [ s ] then arguments similar to the ones given above can be used to show that under the same hypothesis every smooth point of @xmath4 is a frchet smooth point .",
    "let @xmath95 and @xmath96 be a banach space such that @xmath97 is an @xmath0-ideal in @xmath98 ( see corollary 6.4 of [ kw ] for a necessary and sufficient condition for this to happen ) . if @xmath99 is a smooth point , it follows from theorem 1 of [ gy2 ] that @xmath100 .",
    "thus if @xmath96 further satisfies the condition @xmath101 is hahn  banach smooth , then any smooth point of @xmath102 is very smooth .",
    "let @xmath4 be an @xmath0-ideal in its bidual .",
    "see chapters iii and vi of [ hww ] for several examples of such spaces from among function spaces and spaces of operators .",
    "it follows from our proposition  2 and theorem  2 of [ r7 ] where we have proved that @xmath4 is an @xmath0-ideal under appropriate canonical embeddings in all the duals of even order , that every smooth point of @xmath4 is very smooth and continues to be a very smooth point of all the duals of even order of @xmath4 .",
    "assume further @xmath103 has no smooth points then since @xmath4 is hahn  banach smooth ( see [ hww ] , corollary  iii.2.15 ) , we get that any smooth point of @xmath59 is very smooth . @xmath104 and @xmath105 are well - known examples of this phenomenon ( see [ ky ] ) .",
    "it may be worth recalling here that any such @xmath4 ( see [ hww ] , theorem  iii.4.6 ) can be renormed to have a strictly convex dual ( and hence every unit vector is a smooth point ) and continues to be an @xmath0-ideal in the bidual with respect to the new norm . thus in this renorming ,",
    "all the unit vectors are very smooth and continue to be very smooth in all the duals of @xmath4 of even order .",
    "the next example is once again from operator theory .",
    "let @xmath106 be separable banach spaces in the classes @xmath107 and @xmath108 for some @xmath109 ( see [ hww ] , chapter vi and [ w1 ] ) . since @xmath9 is an @xmath0-ideal in its bidual , @xmath20 and",
    "since the quotient space has no smooth points ( see [ hww ] , lemma  vi.5.18 ) , it follows that every smooth point of @xmath20 is very smooth .",
    "in particular in @xmath110 every smooth point is very smooth .",
    "it follows from theorem  6 of [ r7 ] that there are no very smooth points in @xmath45 .",
    "it can thus be deduced from proposition  17 in this paper that @xmath111 does not have very smooth points .",
    "the question of very smooth points of @xmath112 will also be considered later in this paper .",
    "our next example shows that unlike the situation described in the previous examples , the fourth dual of @xmath4 ( denoted by @xmath113 ) quotiented by @xmath4 can have smooth points .",
    "let @xmath114 .",
    "it follows from theorem 2 of [ r7 ] that it is an @xmath0-ideal in @xmath115 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath115 can be identified with a @xmath116 space and isolated points of @xmath16 correspond precisely to one - dimensional @xmath24-summands ( or atoms ) of @xmath117 .",
    "now @xmath118 , where @xmath119 .",
    "see chapter  i of [ hww ] .",
    "thus @xmath120 can be identified as @xmath121 . to exhibit smooth points",
    "it is therefore enough to exhibit isolated points in @xmath122 .",
    "now for any @xmath123 since @xmath124 is an @xmath24-summand , it is an isolated point of @xmath125 .",
    "we do not know if a similar result is true in the non - commutative situation of @xmath126 .",
    "in the next proposition we again impose a condition on the quotient space to preserve very smooth points and this result is modeled on proposition  3.4 of [ gi ] . here",
    "we will be assuming that the subspace @xmath74 is only an ideal ( in the sense of [ gks ] ) but make up for the loss in the geometry of the projection in the dual , by making the topological assumption that the quotient space is a grothendieck space , that is , weak@xmath73 and weak sequential convergence coincide in the dual of the quotient space .",
    "it is known that any von neumann algebra is a grothendieck space , by [ p ] .",
    "we recall from [ s ] and [ gi ] that for a smooth point to be very smooth one only needs to verify weak@xmath73-weak sequential continuity of the norm attaining functional .",
    "we also recall that any smooth grothendieck space is reflexive .",
    "@xmath56    let @xmath4 be a smooth banach space and let @xmath75 be an ideal such that @xmath127 is a grothendieck space .",
    "then a very smooth point of @xmath74 is also a very smooth point of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a projection of norm one in @xmath70 such that @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath129 be a very smooth point of @xmath74 and let @xmath130 be the unique functional with @xmath131 .",
    "we shall show that for any sequence @xmath132 such that @xmath133 in the weak@xmath73-topology also converges in the weak topology .",
    "since for any @xmath12 , @xmath134 is the norm preserving extension of @xmath135 , we have that @xmath136 and also @xmath137 is isometric to @xmath87 via the map @xmath138 .",
    "thus @xmath139 in the weak@xmath73-topology of @xmath87 and hence by hypothesis it would converge in the weak topology .",
    "therefore @xmath140 converges to zero in the weak@xmath73-topology and as @xmath127 is a grothendieck space , this convergence is also in the weak topology .",
    "hence @xmath133 in the weak topology .",
    "therefore , @xmath129 is a very smooth point of @xmath4 .",

    "since @xmath12 is a smooth point of @xmath117 we get that @xmath255",

    "thus for every equivalent norm on @xmath4 , the unit ball has an extreme point of the unit ball ( w. r. t the equivalent norm ) of @xmath115 .",
    "hence it follows from corollary 6 of [ hu ] that @xmath4 has the radon ",
    "nikodm property .",
    "in a series of papers in the 80 s ruess and stegall ( [ rs1 ] , [ rs2 ] ) have showed that @xmath67-denting points of @xmath257 and @xmath180 coincide and are precisely points of the form @xmath258 , where @xmath259 and @xmath260 are @xmath67-denting points of @xmath261 and @xmath262 respectively .",
    "using a result of lin  _ et  al _ [ llt ] , a denting ( @xmath67-denting ) point is precisely an extreme point that is a point of weak - norm ( @xmath67-norm ) continuity of the identity map in the dual unit ball .    while investigating the question of very smooth points in the unit ball of spaces of operators",
    "one encounters extreme points of @xmath263 ( or @xmath152 ) that are points of @xmath14 continuity .",
    "our theorem in the previous section is an attempt to prove a ruess  stegall type result in one direction ( see remark 13 ) .",
    "we could describe them fully only for the space of compact operators when @xmath264 .",

    "any @xmath274 that is a @xmath14 point of continuity is of the form @xmath179 , where @xmath275 is a @xmath14 point of continuity and @xmath178 is also a @xmath14 point of continuity .",

    "hence by our assumption this convergence occurs in the weak topology",
    ". therefore @xmath282 .",
    "the following corollary is now easy to see and should be compared with the description of smooth points where one needed extra assumptions on the quotient space , see [ ky ] , [ gy2 ] and [ hww ] chapter vi .",

    "in the concluding part of this paper we consider situations where @xmath68 fails to have points of @xmath14 continuity . for such spaces , @xmath10 fails to have very smooth points .",
    "we recall from [ hww ] that @xmath285 is said to be an @xmath24-ideal if there is an onto projection @xmath286 such that @xmath287 for all @xmath288 .",
    "also if a banach space @xmath4 , when considered under the canonical embedding , as a subspace of @xmath59 , is an @xmath24-ideal then @xmath4 is said to be an @xmath24-embedded space .",
    "see [ hww ] , chapter  iv and vi for several examples of @xmath24-embedded spaces from among function spaces and spaces of operators . in what follows",

    "let @xmath289 ( under the canonical embedding ) and suppose @xmath4 is a proper @xmath24-ideal in @xmath22 .",

    "let @xmath153 be a @xmath291 .",
    "we get the necessary contradiction by showing that @xmath12 has no unique norm preserving extension to @xmath292 and hence to @xmath59 .",
    "choose a @xmath293 , i.e. , such that @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "we note that since @xmath289 under the canonical embedding , @xmath12 has a natural extension as the evaluation functional to @xmath22 .",
    "we continue to denote this extension by @xmath12 .",
    "now for any @xmath77 , @xmath296 and as @xmath297 is a @xmath0-projection , @xmath298 . hence there is no unique extension .      in view of this remark",
    "the following question can be asked : ` does there exist a very smooth space @xmath4 so that no unit vector is a smooth point of the fourth dual of @xmath4 ? ' this however is not the case . to see this note that since @xmath4 is very smooth , @xmath70 has the radon ",
    "nikodm property ( see [ s ] ,  3 ) , thus @xmath4 has points of frchet differentiability ( see [ b ] , proposition  5.6.13 ) .",
    "it is well known that a point of frchet differentiability continues to be a point of frchet differentiability of all the duals of even order of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath4 be an @xmath24-embedded space with the metric approximation property and let @xmath22 be any banach space .",
    "there are no points of @xmath14 continuity in the dual unit ball of the projective tensor product space @xmath300 .",
    "we use the known inclusions ( under canonical embeddings ) @xmath301 see [ r6 ] . since @xmath4 is an @xmath24-ideal in @xmath59 it follows from theorem vi.6.8 of [ hww ] that @xmath302 is an @xmath24-ideal in @xmath303 .",
    "it thus follows from our above proposition that there are no points of @xmath14 continuity in the dual unit ball .    for any positive measure @xmath304 , @xmath305 is an @xmath24-embedded space with the metric approximation property . for any banach space @xmath22 ,",
    "let @xmath306 denote the space of @xmath22-valued bochner integrable functions . since @xmath307 we get that there are no @xmath14 points of continuity in the dual unit ball of @xmath306 .",
    "we recall that @xmath308 can be identified with @xmath309 .",
    "thus when @xmath4 is an @xmath24-embedded space with the metric approximation property there are no points of @xmath14 continuity in @xmath310 .",

    "this geometric condition has been well studied in the literature , see [ dgz ] .",
    "we use these ideas in the next corollary .",
    "turning once more to spaces of operators we recall that a banach space @xmath4 is said to have the daugavet property if @xmath315 for all compact operators @xmath1 ( see [ w ] , definition  2.1 and theorem 2.7 ) . any space with the daugavet property contains an isomorphic copy of @xmath45 ( see [ w ] , theorem  2.6 ) .        since @xmath4 has the metric approximation property it follows from example 1 in [ r6 ] that @xmath317 under the canonical embedding . since @xmath4 satisfies the daugavet property the conclusion follows .",
    "this author has proved recently ( [ r2 ] , [ r3 ] ) that when @xmath16 is infinite , for the space @xmath25 there are no point of @xmath318-norm continuity in the unit ball .",
    "when @xmath25 is a dual space it would be interesting to know if the unit ball can have points of @xmath14 continuity ( with respect to a predual ! ) .",
    "we have some partial results .",
    "it follows from [ cg ] that when @xmath4 is reflexive the assumption @xmath319 is a dual space implies that @xmath16 is hyperstonean .",
    "hence the ( unique ) predual is of the form @xmath320 for a category measure @xmath321 on @xmath16 .",
    "since @xmath4 is reflexive , it follows from p. 200 of [ hww ] , that @xmath322 is an @xmath24-embedded space .",
    "hence @xmath323 has no points of @xmath14 continuity .",
    "similar arguments work when @xmath4 is the predual of a von neumann algebra . in this case",
    "if @xmath319 is a dual space , then @xmath16 is extremally disconnected and hence @xmath319 is a von neumann algebra and hence is the dual of an @xmath24-embedded space .",
    "turning to the case of weakly compact operators valued in a @xmath116 space or more generally if one considers the space @xmath324 , ( functions continuous when @xmath4 has the weak topology ) , this author has proved in [ r1 ] that if @xmath325 is a dual space then @xmath4 is reflexive and @xmath16 is hyperstonean .",
