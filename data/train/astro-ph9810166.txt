    "the fine - structure constant @xmath3 is the key parameter of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "initially it was introduced by sommerfeld in 1916 for describing the fine structure of atomic levels and corresponding resonance lines .",
    "later it became clear that @xmath0 is important for description of the gross structure of atomic and molecular spectra as well as fine one .",
    "moreover , now we know that _ any electromagnetic phenomena may be described in terms of the powers of @xmath0_. in reality , @xmath0 is not a true constant .",
    "it is established in the quantum field theory and confirmed by high - energy experiments that the coupling constants depend on distance ( or momentum , or energy ) because of vacuum polarization ( see , e.g. , okun 1996 ) .",
    "here we consider the low - energy limit of @xmath0 , namely , its variation in the course of the cosmological evolution of the universe .",
    "the possibility of fundamental constants to vary arose in the discussion of milne ( 1937 ) and dirac ( 1937 ) .",
    "( for a sketch of the history of the problem of variability of the fundamental constants , see varshalovich & potekhin 1995 ) .",
    "the most important dirac s statement was that _ the constancy of the fundamental physical constants should be checked in an experiment_.    the value of the fine - structure constant is known with rather high accuracy @xmath4 .",
    "the codata recommended value based on the 1997 adjustment of the fundamental constants of physics and chemistry is equal to @xmath5 .",
    "however , even this high precision does not exclude the possibility that the @xmath0 value was different in early cosmological epochs .",
    "moreover , some contemporary theories allow @xmath0 to be different in different points of the space - time . endeavours of unification of all fundamental interactions lead to a development of multidimensional theories like kaluza - klein and superstring ones which predict not only energy dependence of the constants but also dependence of their low - energy limits on cosmological time .    _ superstring theories .",
    "_ the superstring theory is a real candidate for the theory which is able to unify gravity with all other interactions . at present",
    "this theory is the only one which treats gravity in a way consistent with quantum mechanics . in the low energy limit @xmath6  gev , where @xmath7 is the gravitational constant , @xmath8 is the planck constant , and @xmath9 is the speed of light )",
    ", the superstring theory reduces to the classical general relativity ( gr ) with , however , an important difference : all versions of the theory predict the existence of the dilaton which is a scalar partner of the tensorial graviton .",
    "this immediately leads to an important conclusion that all the coupling constants and masses of elementary particles , being dependent on the dilaton scalar field @xmath10 , should be space and time dependent .",
    "thus , the existence of a weakly coupled massless dilaton entails small , but non - zero , observable consequences such as jordan - brans - dicke - type deviations from gr and cosmological variations of the fine structure constant and other gauge coupling constants .",
    "the relative rate of the @xmath0 variation is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the main parameter that determines the efficiency of the cosmological relaxation of the dilaton field @xmath10 towards its extreme value @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the hubble constant ( damour & polyakov 1994 ) . in principle , the variation of @xmath0 defined by eq .  ( [ damour ] )",
    "depends on cosmological evolution of the dilaton field and may be non - monotonous as well as different in different space - time regions .    _ kaluza - klein theories . _ in superstring models the transition from @xmath15-dimensional string objects to the four - dimensional observed reality proceed through a compactification of the extra dimensions .",
    "generalised kaluza - klein theories offer another possibility of unification of gravity and the other fundamental gauge interactions via their geometrization in a @xmath15-dimensional curved space . in such theories",
    "the truly fundamental constants are defined in @xmath16 dimensions and any cosmological evolution of the extra @xmath17 dimensions would result in a variation of the fundamental constants measured in the observed four - dimensional world .",
    "for example , in the kaluza - klein theories the fine - structure constant @xmath0 evolves as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a geometric scaling factor which characterises the curvature of the additional @xmath17-dimensional subspace ( chodos & detweiler 1980 ; freund 1982 ; marciano 1984 ) .",
    "there are many different versions of the theories described above and they predict various time - dependences of the fundamental constants .",
    "bounds on the variation rates of the fundamental constants may serve as an important tool for checking the validity of different theoretical models of the grand unification and cosmological models related to them .",
    "_    in the next section we briefly consider the basic methods allowing one to obtain restrictions on possible variations of fundamental constants . in sect .",

    "[ sect - concl ] , conclusions are given .",
    "theoretical and experimental techniques used to investigate time variation of the fundamental constants may be divided into extragalactic and local methods .",
    "the latter ones include astronomical methods related to the galaxy and the solar system , geophysical methods , and laboratory measurements .",
    "an interest in the problem of changing constants has increased after an announcement of a relative frequency drift observed by several independent research groups using long term comparisons of the cs frequency standard with the frequencies of h- and hg@xmath22-masers .",
    "such drift , in principle , could arise from a time variation of @xmath0 because h - maser , cs , and hg@xmath22 clocks have a different dependence on @xmath0 via relativistic contributions of order @xmath23 .",
    "a detailed description of the laboratory method based on such comparisons may be found in prestage et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , breakiron ( 1993 ) .",
    "stringent limits to @xmath0 variation have been presented by shlyakhter ( 1976 ) and damour & dyson ( 1996 ) , who have analysed the isotope ratio @xmath24sm/@xmath25sm produced by the natural uranium fission reactor that operated about @xmath26 yrs ago in the ore body of the oklo site in gabon , west africa .",
    "this ratio turned out to be considerably lower than that in the natural samarium , which is believed to have occurred due to the neutron capture by @xmath24sm during the uranium fission .",
    "shlyakhter ( 1976 ) has concluded that the neutron capture cross section in @xmath24sm has not changed significantly in the @xmath26 yrs .",
    "however , the rate of the neutron capture reaction is sensitive to the position of the resonance level @xmath27 , which depends on the strong and electromagnetic interactions . at variable @xmath0 and invariable",
    "constant of the strong interaction ( that is just a model assumption ) , the shift of the resonance level would be determined by changing the difference of the coulomb energies between the ground state @xmath24sm and the excited state of @xmath28sm@xmath29 corresponding to the resonance level @xmath27 . unfortunately , there are no experimental data for the excited level of @xmath28sm@xmath29 in question .",
    "damour & dyson ( 1996 ) have assumed that the coulomb energy difference between the nuclear states in question is not less than one between the _ ground _ states of @xmath24sm and @xmath28sm .",
    "the latter energy difference has been estimated from isotope shifts and equals @xmath30 mev .",
    "however , it looks unnatural that a weakly bound neutron , captured by a @xmath24sm nucleus to form the highly excited state @xmath28sm@xmath29 , can so strongly affect the coulomb energy .",
    "moreover , the data of isomer shift measurements of different nuclei indicate that the mean - square radii ( and therefore the coulomb energy ) of the charge - distribution for excited states of heavy nuclei may be not only larger but also considerably _ smaller _ than the corresponding radius for the ground states ( kalvius & shenoy 1974 ) .",
    "this indicates the possibility of violation of the basic assumption involved by damour & dyson ( 1996 ) in the analysis of the oklo phenomenon , and therefore this method may possess a lower actual sensibility .",
    "another possibility of studying the effect of changing fundamental constants is to use the standard model of the primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "the amount of @xmath31he produced in the big bang is mainly determined by the neutron - to - proton number ratio at the freezing - out of n@xmath32p reactions .",
    "the freezing - out temperature @xmath33 is determined by the competition between the expansion rate of the universe and the @xmath34-decay rate .",
    "a comparison of the observed primordial helium mass fraction , @xmath35 , with a theoretical value allows to obtain restrictions on the difference between the neutron and proton masses at the epoch of the nucleosynthesis and , through it , to estimate relative variation of the curvature radius @xmath19 of the extra dimensions in multidimensional kaluza  klein - like theories as well as the @xmath0 value ( kolb et al . 1986 ; barrow 1987 ) .",
    "however one can notice that different coupling constants might change simultaneously .",
    "for example , increasing the constant of the weak interactions @xmath36 would cause a weak freeze - out at a lower temperature , hence a decrease in the primordial @xmath31he abundance . this process would compete with the one described above , therefore",
    ", it reduces sensibility of the estimates .",
    "finally , the restrictions would be different for different cosmological models since the expansion rate of the universe depends on the cosmological constant @xmath37 .",
    "a number of other methods are based on the stellar and planetary models .",
    "the radii of the planets and stars and the reaction rates in them are influenced by values of the fundamental constants , that offers a possibility to check the variability of the constants by studying , for example , lunar and earth s secular accelerations , which has been done using satellite data , tidal records , and ancient eclipses .",
    "another possibility is offered by analysing the data on binary pulsars and the luminosity of faint stars",
    ". a variety of such methods has been critically reviewed by sisterna & vucetich ( 1990 ) .",
    "all of them have relatively low sensibility .",
    "an analysis of natural long - lived @xmath0- and @xmath34- decayers , such as @xmath38re or @xmath24sm in geological minerals and meteorites , is much more sensitive ( e.g. , dyson 1972 ) .",
    "a combination of these methods , reconsidered by sisterna & vucetich ( 1990 ) , have yielded an estimate @xmath39 .",
    "the following weak points are inherent to the methods described above :    * the derived restrictions strongly depend on model conjectures . *",
    "the `` local '' methods give estimates for only a narrow space - time region around the solar system .",
    "for example , the time of the operation of the oklo reactor corresponds to the cosmological redshift @xmath40 , while a method based on observations of quasar spectra ( described below ) makes it possible to bring out evolutionary effects for large span of redshifts to @xmath41 .",
    "this and other problems , as we believe , can be solved by an astrophysical method which will be described in the next section .",
    "an astrophysical method that allows one to estimate @xmath0 value at early stages of the universe evolution was originally proposed by savedoff ( 1956 ) . bahcall and schmidt ( 1967 )",
    "were the first to apply this method to fine - splitting doublets in quasar spectra .",
    "a recent update of this method has given the result : @xmath42 yr@xmath43 for upper limit ( 95% c.l . ) on a possible @xmath0 variation ( cowie and songaila 1995 ) .",
    "a more stringent limit is presented in the paper by varshalovich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and in this paper .",
    "we adhere the conventional belief that the quasar is an object of cosmological origin .",
    "its continual spectrum was formed at an epoch corresponding to the redshift @xmath44 of main emission details specified by relationship @xmath45 .",
    "quasar spectra show the absorption resonance lines of the ions c iv , mg ii , si iv , and others , corresponding to the @xmath46 and @xmath47 transitions ( see fig .  [ figsi ] ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath48 and @xmath49 is due to the fine splitting between the @xmath50 and @xmath51 energy levels .",
    "the relative magnitude of the fine splitting of the corresponding resonance lines is approximately proportional to the square of @xmath0 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath55 is equal to @xmath56 , where the subscripts @xmath44 and 0 denote the fine - splitting doublet in a quasar spectrum and the laboratory value , respectively .",
    "hence , the relative change in @xmath0 can be approximately written as @xmath57 ,     \\label{delta - alpha}\\ ] ] provided that @xmath58 is small .",
    "thus , by measuring @xmath48 and @xmath49 in an absorption system corresponding to the redshift @xmath44 and comparing the derived and laboratory values , one can directly estimate the difference between @xmath0 at the epoch @xmath44 and the present value .",
    "it is to be noted that this method is the only one which provides direct values of @xmath59 for different space - time points of the universe .",
    "thus , using this method we can study not only possible deviations of the fine - structure constant from its present value but also its values in space regions which were causally disconnected at earlier evolutionary stages of the universe ( e.g. tubbs & wolfe 1980 ; varshalovich & potekhin 1995 ) .",
    "tubbs & wolfe ( 1980 ) ( see also references therein ) have used a coincidence of redshifts of optical resonant lines of ions with redshifts of the hydrogen 21 cm radio lines in distant absorption systems to derive an upper limit on the combination @xmath60 at @xmath61 . here , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the proton gyromagnetic factor and the masses of electron and proton , respectively .",
    "recently , drinkwater et al . (",
    "1998 ) used a similar method of comparison of the redshifts of the hi ( 21 cm ) and molecular radio lines at redshift @xmath65 in two quasars to place a new strongest restriction on fractional variation of @xmath66 at the level @xmath67 , from which they concluded that @xmath68 .",
    "two drawbacks are inherent to this method of comparison : ( i ) it does not give direct restriction on variation of @xmath0 , @xmath62 , or electron - to - nucleon mass ratios , but only on their combination .",
    "( ii ) one can not be sure that the hydrogen and molecular absorption lines originate from the same cloud along the respective lines of sight .",
    "since the analysed line profiles were complex and required decomposition into several contours , the perfect juxtaposition of the hydrogen and molecular lines ( hence the seemingly extra high accuracy ) might result from accidental coincidence of redshifts of different components of the line profiles",
    ". only analysis of the ratios of wavelengths of the same ion species ( in particular , the doublet ratios mentioned above ) is free of such ambiguity .",
    "detailed discussion of possible sources of systematical and statystical errors of the method based on eq .",
    "( [ delta - alpha ] ) has been given elsewhere ( potekhin & varshalovich 1994 ) . the most significant source of possible systematical error turned out to be the uncertainty in the laboratory wavelengths @xmath69 ( see below ) .",
    "some errors which have a systematic character for one selected absorption system ( e.g. , the shifts of estimated line centers resulting from occasional unidentified blending of partially saturated lines ) become random ( statistical ) for a sample of unrelated absorption systems . for this reason , potekhin & varshalovich have argued that one should not confide in the errorbars estimated for individual absorption systems , but derive the error from the actual scatter of the data .",
    "for example , webb et al . (",
    "1998 ) , using individual estimates of statistical errors of several fine - structure absorption systems , reported an unprecedented accuracy and claimed an evidence for nonmonotonic @xmath0 variation : @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "however , an independent statistical treatment of the data presented in their paper , disregarding the errorbars but using the actual scatter of the data to estimate the confidence level , yields ( in the same range of redshift ) @xmath72 , indicating that the individual statistical errors reported by the authors significantly underestimate the actual statistical uncertainty . here",
    ", the systematic error @xmath73 is mainly due to the uncertainty in the laboratory wavelengths [ see eq .",
    "( [ sigma0 ] ) below ] .",
    "in this paper we apply the described method to a sample of 20 absorption systems at @xmath74 , selected according to the criteria formulated in the next section .",
    "of the available alkali - like doublets observed in quasar spectra such as c iv , mg ii , al iii , o vi , n v , si iv , and others , we have selected for our analysis the si iv line doublet , because it has the greatest ratio @xmath75 , allowing this ratio to be measured most accurately .",
    "the abundance of silicon and its ionization state , as a rule , is such that the si iv doublet lines occur on a linear part of the growth curve , which simplifies determination of the central wavelength of each line .",
    "the laboratory values of the si iv doublet wavelengths ( @xmath76    and @xmath77   , according to striganov & odintsova 1982 ; @xmath76    and @xmath78",
    " , according to morton et al .",
    "1988 ) are known with an uncertainty @xmath79  m .",
    "this uncertainty can introduce an appreciable systematic error in the determination of @xmath80 from eq .",
    "( [ delta - alpha ] ) . in the case of the si iv doublet",
    ", this error can be estimated as @xmath81 this value of the systematic error for si iv is the smallest among all alkali - like ion species listed above .",
    "available observational data on si iv doublets in quasar spectra have been selected taking into account the following criteria :    1 .",
    "high resolution fwhm @xmath82 25 km / s .",
    "2 .   wavelength of each doublet component is measured independently ( without including the a priori information on @xmath83 ) .",
    "any obvious blending of each component of the doublet is absent .",
    "equivalent width ( @xmath84 ) ratio of the doublet components is limited to @xmath85 + ( in conformity with the oscillator strength ratio ) .",
    "the lines are detected at the level higher than @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a noise level .",
    "6 .   a dispersion curve for calibration is carefully determined ",
    "e.g. , using the technique described in the next section .",
    "unfortunately , many of recent data found in literature do not often satisfy the necessary conditions 2 , 3 , and 5 .",
    "suitable observational data have been presented by petitjean et al .",

    "( 1996 ) .",
    "observations were carried out in 1994 using the main stellar spectrograph of the 6-m telescope .",
    "a schmidt camera ( f:2.3 ) , reconstructed to operate with a ccd array , was employed . in combination with a 600 lines mm@xmath43 diffraction grating operating in the second order ,",
    "this camera yielded a linear reciprocal dispersion of 14 @xmath88 mm@xmath43 ( 0.24   pixel@xmath43 ) .",
    "since this study is metrological in essence , special attention was paid to wavelength calibration and check measurements . a th+ar lamp and the atlas of the th+ar spectrum constructed from echelle data ( dodorico et al . 1987 ) , which gave vacuum wavelengths @xmath89 to within 0.001  , were employed for calibration .",
    "ten to twenty reference lines were used to construct the dispersion curve in the form of a chebyshev polynomial ( @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the chebyshev polynomial of @xmath92th order ) for each of the spectral segments in question .",
    "the nonlinear terms ( @xmath93 ) of the dispersion curve were determined especially carefully , because the accuracy of the measured ratio @xmath94 was particularly sensitive to the nonlinearity of the scale , contrary to the absolute calibration ( i.e. @xmath95 ) .",
    "for the same reason , the spectrograph was adjusted for each of the si iv doublets in such way that both doublet components , with a separation of about 36   for @xmath96 , were in the middle of the spectral segment corresponding to one diffraction order , where the nonlinear distortions of the scale were at a minimum , while the sensitivity was at a maximum .",
    "the wavelengths @xmath48 and @xmath49 were determined by gausian decomposition of the corresponding absorption lines in the observed quasar spectra .",

    "<S> endeavours of the unification of the four fundamental interactions have resulted in a development of theories having cosmological solutions in which low - energy limits of fundamental physical constants vary with time . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of such theoretical models should be checked by comparison of the theoretical predictions with observational and experimental bounds on possible time - dependences of the fundamental constants .    based on high - resolution measurements of quasar spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the following direct limits on the average rate of the cosmological time variation of the fine - structure constant @xmath0 : @xmath1 is the most likely limit , and @xmath2 is the most conservative limit .    analogous estimates published previously , as well as other contemporary tests for possible variations of @xmath0 ( those based on the `` oklo phenomenon '' , on the primordial nucleosynthesis models , and others ) are discussed and compared with the present upper limit . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the present result is the most conservative one . </S>"
