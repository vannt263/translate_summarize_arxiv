    "lyman-@xmath1 blobs ( labs ) are @xmath5100kpc scale radio - quiet lyman-@xmath1 emission line nebulae , with integrated luminosities up to @xmath6w .",
    "labs were first discovered during the course of deep optical narrowband imaging of the small selected area 22@xmath7 ( ssa22 ) field ( steidel et al .",
    "2000 ) , which was known to contain a significant overdensity of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath8 ( steidel et al .  1998 ) , although previously francis et al .  ( 1996 ) and keel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) had also detected extended ly@xmath1 emission around luminous galaxies at @xmath9 ( both in high density environments ) and extended ly@xmath1 emission was reported to be associated with some of the first high-_z _ submillimetre galaxies ( smgs , e.g. , ivison et al .",
    "subsequent narrowband ( and broadband , see prescott et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ) surveys of the ssa22 ` protocluster ' and elsewhere have since revealed a substantial sample of these high redshift nebulae , with a range of ly@xmath1 luminosities and extents ( e.g. ,  matsuda et al .  2004 , 2011 , yang et al .",
    "2009 , erb et al .",
    "2011 , bridge et al .",
    "2013 ) and often inhabiting dense environments ( e.g.  prescott et al .",
    "2008 ) .    since their discovery",
    ", the nature of labs has been in debate .",
    "it was recognised early on that the galaxy halo cooling budget would contain a significant cold component ( white & frenk  1991 ) , and low metallicity gas at @xmath10@xmath11k cools most efficiently via ly@xmath1 emission through collisional excitation ( fabian & nulsen  1977 , katz & gunn  1991 , katz et al .",
    "1996 , haiman et al .",
    "2000 ) , so one train of thought is that extended ly@xmath1 emission implies the presence of potentially pristine cold gas in the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) .",
    "taking this idea further , many cosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggest that the baryonic growth of massive ( @xmath12 ) galaxies at @xmath13 ( and for lower mass galaxies at _ all _ epochs ) is dominated by a mode of ` cold accretion ' in the form of narrow filamentary streams that penetrate the hot , virially shocked halo gas ( katz et al .",
    "2003 , kere et al .",
    "2005 ,  2009 , dekel et al",
    ".  2009 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the predicted cold flows have so - far eluded unambiguous observation and some recent simulations seem to refute the existence of cold flows that survive to the disc altogether ( nelson et al.2013 ) .",
    "nevertheless , labs have been touted as the closest we have come to identifying the filamentary cold mode accretion phenomenon in nature .",
    "while the cosmological gas simulations can track the history of cold gas easily enough , the predicted fluxes of the cooling ly@xmath1 emission are far more uncertain , with the flux depending on the complex interplay of turbulence , radiative transfer and local sources of ionizing radiation are taken into account ( e.g. ,  rosdahl & blaziot  2012 ) .",
    "the prescriptions for ly@xmath1 radiative transfer through the gas are notoriously complex due to the fact that it is a resonant line ( neufeld  1990 ) and sensitive to assumptions about the sub - grid physics governing the transport of ly@xmath1 photons through astrophysical media , as well as the many other possible sources of ly@xmath1 photons in and around galaxies . as a result ,",
    "different simulations that apply bespoke models of ly@xmath1 radiative transfer , aiming to reproduce the properties of observed labs , predict a wide range of physical properties ( ly@xmath1 luminosities can vary by an order of magnitude ) and key observables , such as ly@xmath1 extents and surface brightnesses ( faucher - gigure et al .",
    "2010 , goerdt et al .",
    "2010 , rosdahl & blaziot 2012 ) .",
    "the cold flow picture is complicated further when one considers the effects of the presence of a luminous source ( a starburst galaxy or one hosting an active galactic nucleus , agn ) embedded within the lab , which appears to be a common situation ( e.g. ,  francis et al .",
    "1996 , keel et al .  1999 ,",
    "dey et al .",
    "2005 , geach et al .  2005 ,  2007 ,  2009 , colbert et al .",
    "2006 , webb 2009 , rauch et al .",
    "2011 , cantalupo , lilly & haenhelt  2012 ) .",
    "the typical bolometric luminosities of the embedded sources imply an energy balance heavily weighted towards the galaxy , such that only relatively weak coupling , through feedback , would be required to explain the ly@xmath1 luminosities ( geach et al .",
    "again , there is further uncertainty in the type of feedback that would give rise to such extended ly@xmath1 emission : proposals have included emergent ( supernovae - driven ) superwinds that shock heat cold gas swept up in the outflow ( taniguchi & shioya  2000 ) , photoionization of the cgm by escaping ultraviolet continuum radiation from massive stars or the accretion discs of an agn , or photoionization via inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( or locally generated far - infrared ) photons , which are energetically up - scattered by a relic population of relativistic electrons ( e.g. ,  scharf et al .",
    "2003 , fabian et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "geach et al .  ( 2009 ) rule - out ic scattering as a viable lab formation mechanism using a deep x - ray stack in ssa22 , arguing that photoionization by a central agn ( which may be present in up to 50% of labs ) is probably more important , even with fairly modest escape fractions likely to be applicable to the often heavily obscured sources .",
    "recently , hayes et al .  (",
    "2011 ) presented evidence that at least some of the extended ly@xmath1 emission must be in the form of scattered ly@xmath1 radiation , with ly@xmath1 photons generated within a central galaxy scattering in clouds of hi at large ( @xmath550kpc ) galactocentric radius .",
    "the absence of an obvious luminous counterpart in some labs ( e.g. ,  nilsson et al .",
    "2006 , smith & jarvis  2007 , smith et al .",
    "2008 ) has been inferred to be a sign that , in some cases at least , cooling radiation alone is sufficient to explain the extended ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "however , often the constraints on the level of agn or starburst activity are too poor to rule out the involvement of feedback energy completely .    in practice",
    ", it seems likely that a mixture of gravitational cooling and feedback processes are at play in labs , each imparting an ambiguous observational signature in the ly@xmath1 emission that is further muddied by observational limitations ( namely angular and spectral resolution , and poor sensitivity to low surface - brightness features ) . in any case , it is important to note that _ both _ the cooling and ` heating ' models require a reasonable reservoir of gas in the circumgalactic medium , so whatever the process dominating the ly@xmath1 emission , labs provide a rare opportunity to investigate the astrophysics at the galaxy / intergalactic medium interface close to the formation epoch of massive galaxies , @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "the archetypal giant lab , ssa22-lab1 , is the most scrutinized specimen of this class of object , but it is perhaps also the most controversial .",
    "chapman et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2004 ) reported the detection of a very bright submillimeter galaxy at the center of the nebula , with a 850@xmath0 m ( james clerk maxwell telescope [ jcmt]/scuba ) flux of @xmath517mjy , implying a galaxy with hyperluminous levels of activity , which geach et al .",
    "( 2007 ) identified with a _",
    "spitzer_-irac source likely to be the counterpart .",
    "however it appears this measurement over - estimated the submillimeter emission .",
    "matsuda et al .  ( 2007 ) observed ssa22-lab1 at higher resolution ( @xmath16 ) using the submillimeter array ( sma ) , at a 1@xmath17 depth of 1.4mjybeam@xmath18 at 880@xmath0 m .",
    "the target was not detected , and the conclusion was that the 850@xmath0 m emission reported by chapman et al .",
    "must be extended on scales of several arcseconds , and resolved out in the sma map .",
    "the mystery deepened when yang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) reported no detection of ssa22-lab1 at 870@xmath0 m in an apex / laboca observation , at a similar resolution to the original scuba observation ( using the on / off chopping technique in photometry mode ) .",

    "most recently , in an aztec / aste 1.1 mm map of the field , tamura et al .",
    "( 2013 ) report only a marginally significant 2.7@xmath17 ( 1.9mjy ) flux enhancement at the position of ssa22-lab1 , again in tension with the original scuba observations .    in this paper",

    "this is within 1.5@xmath30 of a red _ spitzer_-irac continuum counterpart source ( @xmath35@xmath0jy , @xmath36 ) , close to the center of the ly@xmath1 halo that geach et al .",

    "reported above , we measure significant flux densities of @xmath37mjy and @xmath38mjy ( i.e. ,  3@xmath17 detections with consistent flux densities in independent halves of the integration ) , which lend credence to the submillimeter detection of ssa22-lab1 .",

    "( 2007 ) , the 850@xmath0 m emission would only have to be distributed on a scale of a few arcseconds to fall below the sma detection rate .",
    "still , the galaxy - integrated 850@xmath0 m emission implies a vigorously star - forming galaxy . with no other constraints on the shape of the far - infrared spectral energy distribution",
    ", we can only make a rough estimate of the bolometric ( total infrared ) luminosity . assuming a nominal single modified blackbody spectrum with @xmath42 and @xmath43@xmath44k ( magnelli et al .",
    "2012 ) , normalised to @xmath45mjy ( the data do not allow a constraint on either the emissivity or temperature ) , implies a @xmath46@xmath47 , where the infrared luminosity is integrated over @xmath48@xmath49@xmath0 m ( rest frame ) and includes a bolometric correction term of 1.91 to account for hot dust emission at mid - infrared wavelengths not modelled by the single blackbody ( helou et al.1988 ; dale et al .",
    "2001 ; magnelli et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the integrated luminosity estimated above should be considered with a caveat : the 15@xmath30 resolution of the scuba-2 map naturally results in a submillimeter flux measurement that is integrated over the equivalent of @xmath5120kpc at @xmath2 , thus encompassing ( potentially ) several individual sources contributing to the 850@xmath0 m emission .",
    "it is already well known that a significant fraction of submillimeter galaxies ( @xmath5035% and potentially up to 50% ) detected with coarse resolution instruments break - up into several components when observed at higher resolution , as is now possible with sensitive interferometers ( e.g. ,  hodge et al .",
    "2013 ) . given the negative _ k_-correction in the submillimeter bands on the rayleigh - jeans side of the cool dust emission , chance alignments of luminous galaxies across a wide range of epochs could give rise to multiplicity , however , given the likelihood that many high-_z _",
    "submillimeter sources are either physically large , clumpy systems or undergoing mergers means that single detections that resolve into multiple components does not preclude them being considered part of the same physical system .",
    "obviously obtaining higher resolution submillimeter continuum imaging of ssa22-lab1 is now a goal , since that will address this question .",
    "there are some hints that we might expect the scuba-2 850@xmath0 m detection to be extended : the failure to detect continuum emission in the 2@xmath30 resolution sma map of matsuda et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with a 3@xmath17 upper limit of 4.2mjybeam@xmath18 suggests that the 850@xmath0 m flux is distributed on a scale of at least @xmath512@xmath30 . at the position of the irac counterpart , ssa22-lab1a identified by geach et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , an _ hst_-stis image reveals several distinct ( but extremely faint ) ultraviolet components spread over several arcseconds ( chapman et al .",
    "for the sake of argument , in the following we will refer to the central source as a single ulirg - class galaxy ( since , even if the emission was distributed on scales of several arcseconds , this is far smaller than the ly@xmath1 extent of the lab ) , but the reader should remember that at all times we are referring to the total infrared luminosity sampled by the jcmt beam , and this could encompass several distinct  but physically associated  sources .",
    "the detection of a luminous galaxy in the core of ssa22-lab1 is further evidence that lyman-@xmath1 blobs are generally associated with luminous young galaxies , be it an obscured starburst or an agn ( geach et al .",
    "ssa22-lab1 is unique in that it has been studied in far greater detail than any other lab , and therefore offers the best opportunity to understand the astrophysics of the lab phenomenon .",
    "here we revisit the observations of ssa22-lab1 by weijmans et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and hayes et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and relate these to the confirmation of a luminous central source .",
    "weijmans et al .",
    "( 2010 ) present very deep wht / sauron integral field unit ( ifu ) spectral observations of ssa22-lab01 at @xmath52@xmath53@xmath54 , combining the data with the previous observations of bower et al .  ( 2004 ) to form a data cube with total integration time of nearly 24 hours .",
    "the ifu data provide a much better probe of the structure of the ly@xmath1 halo than narrow - band imaging alone ( steidel et al .",
    "2000 , matsuda et al .",
    "2004 ) .    aside from ly@xmath1 emission associated with two lyman break galaxies ( c11 and c15 ) ,",
    "there are three main regions of diffuse ly@xmath1 emission , labelled r1 , r2 and r3 by weijmans et al .",
    "these contain no ultraviolet continuum source , but the two brightest components r2 and r3 ( @xmath55w and @xmath56w respectively ) approximately straddle the peak of the 850@xmath0 m emission that we have identified with scuba-2 .",
    "r1 is best described as a lower surface brightness stucture extending north from r2 towards c15 .",
    "is there a physical motivation for associating the diffuse ly@xmath1 emission with the central submillimetre source ? in fig .  2 ( adapted from weijmans et al .",
    "2010 ) we present the average ly@xmath1 spectra extracted from 2@xmath30 radius apertures at the positions r1 , r2 and r3 indicated on fig .  1",
    ". all the lines are broad , with full width zero intensity widths up to @xmath52000kms@xmath18 , and poorly fit by single gaussian dispersion profiles . as weijmans et al .",
    "show , a double gaussian fit is a better model of the line profiles in all three cases ( a single gaussian combined with a voigt absorption profile also provides an adequate fit to the data ) . in fig .",
    "2 we show the best fitting double gaussian profiles , centered in the rest frame of each component .",
    "r2 and r3 are within 180kms@xmath18 of each other , and both profiles have a dominant red - skewed peak .",
    "in contrast , r1 has a slightly more symmetric profile and is separated from r2 by approximately 300kms@xmath18 .    for resonant line radiation transfer through an optically thick slab",
    "the emergent line profile is symmetric and double peaked , with a minimum at @xmath57 due to scattering at the line resonance ( neufeld  1990 ) . in an hi cloud , the separation of the peaks is set by the gas temperature and column density , which determine the typical frequency change a photon can experience through scattering .",
    "if a large - scale velocity gradient is present , then the line profile becomes asymmetric , with either the red or blue peak dominating , depending on the direction of the velocity gradient with respect to the resonant frequency : outflows generally result in a prominent red peak , whereas infall results in a dominant blue peak ( @xmath58 ly@xmath1 forest absorption suppresses the blue wing whatever the situation ) .",
    "turbulent motions within the medium will also broaden the emergent line , and asymmetric line profiles can also occur due to foreground absorption of ly@xmath1 photons by clumps , or screens , of dust or hi ( as is proposed for the line profile observed in lab2 , see wilman et al .  2005 ) .",
    "it is interesting that the line profiles of r2 and r3 both have dominant red peaks . given their spatial distribution relative to the smg , one could interpret this as evidence of a biconical outflow driven by the central ulirg .",
    "photons from the central source that are back - scattered from the interior , rear wall of the expanding shell will be redshifted out of resonance with the front wall , while photons forward scattered from the front wall remain in resonance with the expanding shell .",
    "note that the bipolar appearance does not necessarily require that the outflow is bipolar : the emergent structure could be equally well explained if ionizing photons only escaped from the central source along preferential directions .",
    "hayes et al .  ( 2011 ) used vlt / fors to measure the polarization of the extended ly@xmath1 emission in ssa22-lab1 . in fig .  1 we overlay the polarization pseudovectors ( @xmath59 ) , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the stokes parameters .",
    "the ring - like geometry of the polarization vectors at large radii is centered approximately at the position of the submillimetre source detected here , with the polarization fraction @xmath63% at a radius of 45kpc .",
    "hayes et al .",
    "argue that such a polarization signal can not be generated _ in situ _ , but is more likely to be scattered light originating from a central source .    our new observations , confirming the presence of a luminous dusty source at the centre of the polarized emission supports the picture where ly@xmath1 photons escaping from a star - forming galaxy or agn undergo a long flight , before encountering hi clouds in the cgm and scattering .",
    "as hayes et al .",
    "explain , it is the rare wing scatterings ( i.e.  photons with large @xmath64 from the ly@xmath1 line center in the rest frame of an hi cloud ) that ( a ) see lower optical depth and are more likely to escape the neutral gas - filled halo and ( b ) have a higher probability of becoming polarized , with a polarization fraction up to @xmath65% . for these reasons , neither shock excitation , photo - ionization or collisional excitation during gravitational cooling in the in - flowing streams can explain the polarization observations , although this is not to say the total ly@xmath1 luminosity is not contributed to in part by non - scattering processes .",
    "the detection of an smg with @xmath66 located between the lobes of r2 and r3 is a smoking gun : not only is the smg spatially coincident with the center of the polarization pattern , but its bolometric luminosity , presumably dominated by far - infrared emission , indicates an ample supply of ly@xmath1 photons , even if the majority of these are absorbed by interstellar dust .",
    "considering a naive model where the infrared luminosity is produced entirely from re - processed starlight and represents the bulk of the active star formation , we expect an _ intrinsic _ ly@xmath1 luminosity of order @xmath67 for case b recombination and a salpeter initial mass function ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1998 , dijkstra & westra  2009 ) .",
    "thus , the escaping ly@xmath1 luminosity is @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the escape fraction of ly@xmath1 photons from the central galaxy .",
    "however , only a fraction , @xmath70 , of these ly@xmath1 photons will go on to scatter in the cgm into our line of sight and thus give rise to the lab .",
    "three key factors affect @xmath70 : ( i ) the cross - section for ly@xmath1hi scattering for photons encountering surrounding neutral gas ; ( ii ) the overall filling factor of those clouds around the central source and ; ( iii ) the velocity distribution of the neutral gas determining how photons can move out of resonance and free stream to the observer .",
    "clearly ( i ) is dependent on the @xmath71 column , but since @xmath72 even for filling factors of unity , this increases the escape fraction required from the central source if scattered light is the sole source of extended ly@xmath1 emission . for @xmath73 ,",
    "this requires @xmath74% to account for the total @xmath75 of r2 and r3 .",
    "this is not unreasonable if one considers a geometry where we are are viewing the ulirg system nearly edge - on , with a large optical depth to the star - forming regions and thus any ultraviolet continuum emission from the central source completely obscured along our line of sight but instead escaping in the plane of the sky ( see geach et al .",
    "this geometry would also impart the largest observable ly@xmath1 polarization signal , as photons escaping to our line of sight would be scattered through 90@xmath28 , and would produce a morphology consistent with the double lobed ly@xmath1 geometry hinted at by the deep sauron observations described in  5.1 .",
    "the observations imply that one of the main sources of ly@xmath1 photons emitted by ssa22-lab1 is either star formation or an agn within the embedded ulirg .",
    "these photons are escaping the galaxy and scattering in cold gas distributed in the cgm . whatever the exact mechanism for ly@xmath1 emission , there must be a large quantity of cold , neutral gas in the cgm .",
    "an open question therefore is the origin of the circumgalactic gas responsible for scattering / emitting the ly@xmath1 photons and giving rise to the observed extended emission - line nebula .",
    "there are two options :    1 .",
    "the cold gas is comprised of pristine material containing dense clumps of hi being accreted onto the dark matter halo ( zheng et al .",
    "2011 ) , potentially delivered by narrow streams within a hotter medium .",
    "ly@xmath1 photons escaping the central galaxy illuminate this gas as they scatter in the clumpy , neutral medium .",
    "the morphology of the resulting lab is therefore somewhat dependent on the geometry of the escaping photons and the covering factor of the incoming clumps , which could be modified as the inflow encounters radiation / outflows from the galaxy .",
    "neutral gas is being ejected into the cgm via a galactic outflow , having already been accreted onto the galaxy .",
    "the outflow forms when shells of cold gas are driven outwards by pressurized bubbles inflated within the ism via energy / momentum injection from stellar winds , supernovae and agn .",
    "the outflow strongly resembles a rarefaction wave escaping the galaxy along paths of least resistance ( e.g. ,  perpendicular to the disc ) , accelerating as they emerge into the low - pressure cgm before fragmenting into cold clumps due to hydrodynamic instabilities and eventually decelerating in the gravitational potential of the halo ( dijkstra & kramer 2012 , creasey et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the key difference between ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is the provenance and history of the cold gas dominanting the cgm : pristine still - cooling or previously cycled through a galaxy ? the two scenarios describing the history of the cgm can be related to the concept of ` velvet rope ' and ` bouncer ' feedback . in velvet rope feedback , gas never gets a chance to enter a galaxy where it can be assimilated into the ism . in contrast , bouncer mode describes feedback that ejects gas from the galaxy back into the cgm",
    ".    of course , these scenarios are not mutually exclusive .",
    "gas must be delivered to growing galaxies at some point , and this is likely to be close to , or simultaneous with , the time the galaxies undergo their most rapid growth .",
    "therefore it is possible that emergent shells comprised of enriched gas could also sweep - up cold , metal - free inflowing material that has not yet reached the disc ( thus , potentially preventing it from being accreted : velvet rope feedback ) . in scenario 1 ,",
    "some of the inflowing gas might be blown back by an emergent wind , and the observations suggest that the bulk of the line - emitting gas is outflowing with respect to the central ulirg ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "one problem with this scenario is that the covering factors of the streams are expected to be very small ( @xmath76@xmath15 per cent ; faucher - gigure & kere2011 ) .",
    "outflows are likely to emerge preferentially between these streams , allowing the cold inflowing material to continue to fuel the disc unarrested , while cold interstellar material is simultaneously ejected ( bouncer feedback ) . however , the interaction of multi - phase galactic outflows and the narrow cooling streams predicted by models is poorly understood , the hydrodynamic interaction between the two is likely to be complicated , dependent on halo mass , geometry and radius . moreover",
    ", the halo will still have a diffuse atmosphere , even if most of the mass is accreted along filamentary structure ( e.g. ,  crain et al .",

    "while the cold flows model predicts that the inflowing cold gas should also be a source of ly@xmath1 radiation from collisional excitation , the polarization observations show that a significant fraction of the ly@xmath1 emission is not produced _ in situ_. however , in a scenario where ly@xmath1 photons from the central source are scattering in hi clumps in these streams , one must consider the low covering factors predicted for the inflowing cold filaments .",
    "if the escaping ly@xmath1 photons are uncorrelated with the geometry of the filaments ( which could be a naive assumption if one considers that the escape must preferentially be in the directions of lowest density , i.e. ,  potentially _ anti_-correlated with the filaments ) , then one would expect a fraction @xmath77 of the ly@xmath1 photons _ not _ to scatter . in effect",
    ", this drastically increases the required ly@xmath1 luminosity of the central source .",
    "in contrast , gas entrained in a galaxy - scale wind can have covering factors approaching unity , which arguably would result in an observed ly@xmath1 morphology similar to r2 and r3 .",
    "francis et al .  ( 2013 ) argue that the cgm of ly@xmath1 blob b1 ( @xmath78 ) could also be illuminated by scattered ly@xmath1 radiation , either originating from a central source , or via fast shocks in the cgm . in the superwind scenario ,",
    "the fast shock is formed when hot gas driven by the emergent wind from the central source collides with cold gas in the cgm .",
    "the detection of c  iv in the cgm of b1 is taken to be evidence for gas heating via fast shocks ( francis et al .",
    "2001 ) , and francis et al .",
    "( 2013 ) argue that the presence of carbon rules out a primordial origin for this material . enriched cold gas in the vicinity of low - mass satellites within the halo could be the origin ( these could also contribute ly@xmath1 luminosity via ultraviolet leakage ) , as could metal - rich gas previously ejected from the central source . still ,",
    "a primordial origin for at least a fraction of the cold gas can not be ruled out , and indeed should be expected .",
    "it seems that a coherent picture for the ssa22-lab1 system is at last emerging , although puzzles still remain .",
    "the ssa22-lab1 system is clearly a group in the early stage of formation , and while the ly@xmath1 ` bridge ' linking the northern lbg c11 with the main emission structure may well be a remnant cooling flow , the evidence suggests that a significant fraction of the ly@xmath1 emission originates in the central ulirg and scatters in hi clouds distributed in the cgm .",
    "the twist is that the central source does not emit ly@xmath1 photons isotropically , indeed , we do not see ionizing photons from the source , let alone the escaping ly@xmath1 radiation .",
    "nevertheless , the new scuba-2 observations presented here allow us to observe the ultraviolet photons that are reprocessed by internal dust along our line - of - sight .",
    "although we do not see the ultraviolet continuum source directly , abundant ly@xmath1 photons ( and presumably a strong flux of ionizing photons ) must escape along an axis that is almost perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "viewed along the emergent axis from another part of the universe we would almost certainly identify the source as a ly@xmath1 halo containing an ultraviolet continuum source ( as other labs often do , e.g. ,  matsuda et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "ssa22-lab1 offers a fascinating insight into the physics of massive galaxy formation : many of the ingredients of our latest models appear to be in action in this one system , and it clearly provides a unique opportunity to study the astrophysics of the galaxy / cgm interface .",
    "there are three key observations that would provide more important clues :    1 .",
    "sensitive , high - resolution ly@xmath1 imaging .",
    "this would more clearly reveal the morphology of the cold circumgalactic gas as traced by ly@xmath1 , providing the finer detail that might help distinguish an outflow with large covering factor from narrow filamentary streams .",
    "ssa22-lab1 is an ideal target for the multi unit spectroscopic explorer ( muse ) ifu being commissioned on the very large telescope .",
    "morphology of the dust continuum .",
    "high resolution sub - mm imaging would more accurately pin - point the ulirg within the ly@xmath1 halo and potentially provide a clearer picture of the nature of the central luminous source , including the geometry of the obscuring material .",
    "the atacama large millimetre array ( alma ) is an obvious facility to perform this observation .",
    "systemic redshift of the ulirg .",
    "if the galaxy is responsible for a biconical outflow in the plane of the sky ( as suggested by the relative velocities of the regions r2 and r3 ) , then it should be very close in redshift space to the ly@xmath1 peaks of r2 and r3 .",
    "the ulirg systemic redshift could be measured with millimetre observations of high-_j _ co lines , which should trace the densest molecular gas at the sites of star formation within the ulirg , and thus provide an accurate measurement of the systemic redshift relative to the extended ly@xmath1 .",
    "again , this question could be addressed by alma .",

    "<S> ( 2011 ) suggests that the central source is leaking ly@xmath1 photons preferentially in the plane of the sky , which undergo scattering in hi clouds at large galactocentric radius . </S>",
    "<S> the ly@xmath1 morphology around the submillimeter detection is reminiscent of biconical outflow , and the average ly@xmath1 line profiles of the two ` lobes ' are dominated by a red peak , expected for a resonant line emerging from a medium with a bulk velocity gradient that is outflowing relative to the line center . taken together , these observations provide compelling evidence that the central active galaxy ( or galaxies ) is responsible for a large fraction of the extended ly@xmath1 emission and morphology . less clear is the history of the cold gas in the circumgalactic medium being traced by ly@xmath1 : is it mainly pristine material accreting into the halo that has not yet been processed through an interstellar medium ( ism ) , now being blown back as it encounters an outflow , or does it mainly comprise gas that has been swept - up within the ism and expelled from the galaxy ?
