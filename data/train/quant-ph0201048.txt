    "the probable success of experiments aimed at producing magnetically trapped ultracold molecular samples depends heavily on the effects of collisional processes .",
    "for example , paramagnetic alkali dimers can be produced via photassociation of ultracold atoms @xcite , but the resulting molecules , typically in high - lying vibrational states , are subject to vibrational quenching collisions @xcite which can release a large amount of energy and dramatically affect the efficiency of the cooling .",
    "alternatively , cold molecules in their vibrational ground states can be produced either by thermal contact with a cold helium buffer gas @xcite or by stark slowing , for species that possess an electric dipole moment @xcite .",
    "collisions are of obvious importance to buffer - gas cooling ( bgc ) , as well as to forced evaporative cooling ( ec ) that will be required to lower the temperature of these gases further and achieve for instance bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "both processes require large elastic collision rates to thermalize the gas .",
    "so far ec has not been realized in practice for molecules , but the success of the bgc technique for the production of cold cah @xcite and pbo @xcite molecules suggests that in the near future it will be possible to achieve bec using cold molecules .",
    "this would open the way for a number of new and fascinating experiments .    in order",
    "to be magnetically trapped , atoms or molecules must be in a weak - field seeking state , i.e. a state whose energy increases with the strength of the magnetic field . for each trappable weak - field seeking state there",
    "is in general a lower - energy untrapped strong - field seeking state , in which the molecules experience a force away from the center of the trap .",
    "collisions can drive transitions between trapped and untrapped states .",
    "these `` bad '' collisions can cause heating or atom loss .",
    "it is therefore important to assess the rate constants for the inelastic collisions .    in a series of previous papers",
    "the resilience of molecular oxygen against spin - changing collisions was investigated , in collisions of o@xmath1 molecules both with a helium buffer gas @xcite , and with other o@xmath1 molecules @xcite .",
    "these studies found that spin - changing rates due to spin - rotation coupling could be quite large .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath0o@xmath1 molecule , where in the limit of zero field the only allowed exit channels are energetically degenerate with the incident channels , spin - flipping transitions require boosting the centrifugal angular momentum from @xmath4 = 0 to @xmath4 = 2 , meaning that these processes are strongly suppressed by the wigner s threshold laws at collision energies smaller than the height of the exit channel centrifugal barrier .    the results in refs .",
    "@xcite considered only the case of a vanishing external magnetic field , which is obviously not the case in experiments that trap molecules using spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "the present paper therefore explores the role that fields play in determining spin - changing collision rates .",
    "as we demonstrate , the presence of a magnetic field causes a zeeman asymptotic splitting between incident and exit channels , thus lifting the collision energy higher relative to the centrifugal barrier in the exit channel , and removing the wigner s suppression .",
    "studies of spin - changing ultracold collisions in the presence of an external magnetic field have been performed so far only for atomic species @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed dynamical study at cold and ultracold temperatures for the atom - diatom system @xmath0o@xmath1 @xmath5 @xmath2he in a field . the basic model is described in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii we calculate elastic and inelastic rate constants for collisions involving the lowest - lying trappable state of @xmath0o@xmath1 over a wide range of field values ( from 0 up to 5000 gauss ) , then discuss the dependence of the rates on collision energy for several representative values of the field .",
    "this system is of direct relevance to bgc of molecular oxygen .",
    "generally , it allows us to quantify the removal of the wigner s law suppression as the field increases in strength .",
    "on this basis we determine a simple one - parameter fitting formula that reproduces the trend with field and energy of the loss rates . in sec .",
    "iv we use this formula to extend previous results on o@xmath1-o@xmath1 collisions to estimate the influence of the field on ec of this system .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we will consider in this paper molecules consisting of two @xmath0o atoms , whose nuclear spin @xmath6 is equal to @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that total spin * i * = * i*@xmath8 + * i*@xmath1 is conserved in the collision and polarized to its maximum value * i * = 5 , implying that the even molecular rotational states @xmath9 are separated from the odd ones @xcite .",
    "we limit the discussions of this paper to the `` even-@xmath9 '' manifold of molecular states , which is more appealing for cooling purposes @xcite having a spin 1 paramagnetic ground state .",
    "the electronic spin * s * of the o@xmath1 molecule has magnitude @xmath10 = 1 in the electronic ground state @xmath11 we are concerned with throughout this paper .",
    "the angular momentum * s * is coupled to the molecular rotation angular momentum * n * to give * j * , the total molecular angular momentum , which assumes the values @xmath12 , @xmath9 and @xmath13 for @xmath9 @xmath14 0 and is 1 for @xmath9 = 0 .",
    "the hamiltonian operator @xmath15 for molecular oxygen in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath16 can be written as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the rotational constant .",
    "the @xmath0o@xmath1 molecule is considered to be a rigid rotor , with internuclear distance frozen to the equilibrium value of @xmath19 = 2.282 bohr ( the rigid rotor model has been shown to be very accurate for this system at the investigated collision energies @xcite ) .",
    "the fine - structure hamiltonian @xmath20 and the hamiltonian @xmath21 for the interaction of the molecule with the external magnetic field follow the treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite , disregarding the molecular hyperfine interaction .",
    "the fine structure hamiltonian is given as @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a unit vector parallel to the molecular axis and @xmath24 is a second - rank tensor @xcite .",
    "the fine structure parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 have been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , where they have been determined by microwave spectroscopy .",
    "the interaction of the field with the electronic spin can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 indicates the external magnetic field , @xmath29 is the g - factor of the electron and @xmath30 is the bohr magneton .",
    "following @xcite we ignore a small interaction between the field and the rotational angular momentum .",
    "the matrix elements for @xmath20 and @xmath21 have been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , eqs .",
    "( a5 ) and ( a6 ) , for a hund s case b basis set .",
    "we note here that the molecular rotational quantum number @xmath9 is no longer strictly a good quantum number for the molecular states , because different values of @xmath9 are coupled together by the fine - structure hamiltonian @xmath20 and by the interaction with the external field .",
    "the molecular total angular momentum quantum number @xmath31 is still a good quantum number with respect to @xmath20 , but not with respect to the field interaction @xmath21 term .",
    "however , its projection @xmath32 on the quantization axis is still conserved .",
    "consequently , our basis functions should be labeled as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a shorthand index denoting the pair of quantum numbers ( @xmath35 ) in the field dressed basis @xcite . however , the coupling between different @xmath9 s is weak ( the fine - structure coupling is small compared to the rotational separation ) and @xmath9 can be considered `` almost '' a good quantum number .",
    "similarly , @xmath31 is also approximately good for laboratory - strength magnetic fields , so that we can use without confusion the label @xmath36 .",
    "magnetic trapping is strongly related to the behavior of the molecules in a magnetic field .",
    "the low - energy zeeman levels of oxygen are displayed in fig . 1 for the even-@xmath9 species .",
    "( throughout this paper we report energies in units of kelvin by dividing by the boltzmann constant @xmath37 .",
    "these units are related to wave numbers via 1 k = 0.695 @xmath38 ) . in order to be trapped in the usual magnetic traps a molecule must be in a weak - field - seeking state , i.e. , one whose energy rises with increasing magnetic field strength .",
    "thus the state @xmath39 = @xmath40 is the lowest - lying trappable state of the even-@xmath9 manifold , and this is the state on which we focus our attention below .",
    "this state is indicated by a heavy line in figure 1 .",
    "higher - lying states with @xmath9 @xmath41 2 are energetically forbidden at low temperatures .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "1 that for any trapped state there is an untrapped , strong - field - seeking zeeman state at a lower energy . these states are not merely untrapped but antitrapped , experiencing a force away from the trapping region . in a magnetic trap collisions with buffer gas atoms , or more generally with other molecules ,",
    "will therefore ultimately deplete the trap of its molecular population .",
    "the time available for cooling processes like bgc or ec , as well as the lifetime of a molecular bose - einstein condensate , is therefore limited and knowledge of the rate constants for spin - flipping collisions is essential to predict their feasibility .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the theoretical framework for atom - diatom scattering was derived in the limit of zero external field , along the lines of the model originally due to arthurs and dalgarno @xcite , and properly modified to incorporate the electronic spin of the oxygen molecule . here , the formulation of the scattering problem is further extended to account for the interaction with the external magnetic field .",
    "the full hamiltonian operator describing the he - o@xmath1 collision is given by @xmath42 + { \\bf \\hat{h}}_{{\\rm o}_2 } + v(r,\\theta)\\ ] ] after multiplying the wave function by @xmath43 in order to remove first derivatives . here",
    "@xmath44 is the reduced mass for the he - o@xmath1 system , @xmath43 is the modulus of the jacobi vector joining the atom to the molecule s center - of - mass , @xmath45 is the centrifugal angular momentum operator , and @xmath15 is the molecular oxygen hamiltonian defined in ( [ o2ham ] ) . the potential term @xmath46 , depending on both the jacobi vector @xmath43 and on the bending angle @xmath47 that the molecule s axis makes with respect to @xmath48 , accounts for the he - o@xmath1 interaction .",

    "therefore we suppress the first two kets in equation ( [ basis ] ) in the following .",
    "we note here that , at variance with the formulation in the zero field limit , the total angular momentum of the system @xmath57 ( equal to * n * + * s * + * l * ) is no longer a good quantum number , because different @xmath58 s are coupled together by the interaction with the external field .",
    "this means that the dynamical problem is no longer factorizable for different values of @xmath58 , thus requiring larger numbers of channels to be treated simultaneously .",
    "the problem is still factorizable for @xmath55 , but in general the number of channels to be included for each calculation is much larger than in the previous case .",
    "numerical details of the calculations will be given in the next section .",
    "the coupled - channel equations are then propagated using a log - derivative method @xcite and solved subject to scattering boundary conditions to yield a scattering matrix s : @xmath59 as already noted , the projection of the total angular momentum @xmath55 is still a good quantum number , implying that @xmath32 @xmath60 @xmath53 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath60 @xmath63 .",
    "note that in general each of the quantum numbers @xmath9 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath4 , and @xmath53 are subject to change in a collision , consistent with conserving @xmath55 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the state - to - state cross sections are given by : @xmath64 and the corresponding rate coefficients are given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the relative velocity of the collision partners before the collision .",
    "for notational convenience we will in the following refer to collisions that preserve the incident molecular quantum numbers as `` elastic , '' and those that change the quantum numbers as `` loss . ''",
    "in this section we consider elastic and state - changing , inelastic rate constants for the incident channel @xmath67 = @xmath68 . at the investigated collision energies ( from 1 @xmath44k up to 10 k )",
    "there are two open inelastic channels , namely @xmath67 = @xmath69 and @xmath70 , both of which are untrapped ( see fig .",
    "we begin by computing rate constants for the elastic and spin - flipping transitions @xmath71",
    "@xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath74 in the low - field limit .",
    "results in this section refer to 1 @xmath44k collision energy and are converged using partial waves up to @xmath4 = 6 and including the rotational states @xmath9 = 0 , 2 , 4 and 6 for the oxygen molecules .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath43 to which the coupled - channel equations are propagated depends on the strength of the field , ranging from 600 bohr in the case of smallest field to 450 bohr for highest values .",
    "these parameters assure rate constants convergent within less then 5 % , which is adequate for our purposes .    in principle , the scattering matrix should be determined for each possible value of the projection of the total angular momentum @xmath55 .",
    "however , we know that s - wave collisions dominate the incident channel at ultralow collision energies , which corresponds for our incident channel to the value @xmath75 . we have verified that including in the calculation only the @xmath55 = 1 channels changes the results by less than 1 % at @xmath44k energies ; in this section we therefore include only this contribution . the number of channels to be propagated according to the given convergent quantum numbers",
    "is then only 205 .",
    "2 shows elastic and inelastic rate constants at energy @xmath76k and for low values of the field .",
    "the inelastic rate constants are non zero even at zero field , as shown in ref .",
    ". however , in this limit the final states are degenerate with the initial state , and inelastic transitions are strongly suppressed by the presence of a @xmath77-wave centrifugal barrier in the exit channel , whose height is about 0.59 k. this effect is able to suppress the molecule loss , at least as long as the collision energy does not exceed the barrier height @xcite .",
    "as soon as a field is applied , the thresholds are no longer degenerate in energy , so that the energy in the exit channel is not as far below the centrifugal barrier . as a consequence , inelastic transitions are no longer as strongly suppressed , even in the limit of very low collision energy .",
    "rather , they increase dramatically even in a weak field , with rates being boosted by 5 or 6 orders of magnitude in a 1 gauss field . on the other hand ,",
    "elastic scattering is nearly unchanged by the field .",
    "this sudden increase of the inelastic transition rates can be reproduced semiquantitatively by applying the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite , as has been successfully done for the magnetic dipolar interaction of cold alkali atoms @xcite as well as in a number of problems in cold collisions @xcite .",
    "the first order dwba is a simple two state perturbation approximation applicable in cases where inelastic scattering is weak in comparison with elastic scattering .",
    "the dwba expression for the off - diagonal k - matrix elements is : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 represent the energy normalized scattering wave function of the initial and final states calculated on the diabatic potential corresponding to the states involved in the inelastic transition .",
    "@xmath81 is the corresponding diabatic coupling term of the hamiltonian ( [ totalh ] ) .",
    "the first - order dwba result is shown as a dotted line in fig.2 .",
    "the dwba also yields information on the threshold dependence of the loss rates on energy and field . to see this",
    ", first note that the spin - changing processes we are considering are strongly dominated at low collision energy by s - waves in the incident channel , and by d - waves in the exit channel .",
    "this change of partial wave is necessary to conserve angular momentum during a collision that changes the molecule s spin . for small values of the magnetic field",
    "( for which the zeeman splitting does not exceed the height of the exit channel centrifugal barrier ) the exit channel is still in the threshold regime , whereby the wave functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 in ( [ kmatr ] ) can be approximated by the small - argument limit of energy - normalized spherical bessel functions , @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the incident and final wave numbers and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the incident and final partial waves .",
    "assuming a small-@xmath43 cutoff to insure convergence of the integral in ( [ kmatr ] ) with respect to @xmath87 singularity in the coupling potential @xmath88 , the energy - dependence of the k - matrix element is @xmath89 by considering the relationship between @xmath90 and the effective rate constant @xmath91 , it is straightforward to show that the rate constant behaves approximately as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the collision energy , and we have taken into account that the final kinetic energy in the exit channel is incremented by an amount @xmath94 = @xmath95 @xmath29 @xmath96 corresponding to the linear zeeman shift .",
    "@xmath95 (= @xmath32 @xmath5 @xmath62 ) stands for the difference between the initial and final values of @xmath32 in the two channels involved in the transition .",
    "the actual value of @xmath94 is modified by quadratic zeeman shift , but the linear approximation is adequate for achieving a simple fitting formula . in the present case",
    "these shifts amount to less than 10% changes in the approximated rate constants . from eq .",
    "( [ prope ] ) , considering that in our case @xmath97 = 0 and @xmath98 = 2 , a simple expression for the rate constants can be derived : @xmath99 where @xmath100 represents an overall scaling constant and @xmath101 is conveniently chosen as the height of the centrifugal barrier in the exit , d - wave channel . in the limit of very low collision energy ,",
    "the @xmath102 term obviously dominates over @xmath93 , leading to a nonzero rate constant , as is the case for exothermic collisions .",
    "this simple expression allows us to interpret the threshold behavior of the rates with the field , explaining the 5/2 exponential dependence on @xmath16 found in our calculation and shown explicitly in the bilogarithmic plot for the rate constants ( fig .",
    "the dashed lines represent a fit to the rate constants in the limit of zero magnetic field , yielding coefficients @xmath100 = 2.73 @xmath103 10@xmath104 cm@xmath2 sec@xmath106 and @xmath100 = 1.45 @xmath103 10@xmath104 cm@xmath2 sec@xmath106 for the transition to the final states @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "apart from zeros in the actual rate constants , the overall trend is indeed @xmath107 .",
    "the zeros in the real rates arise from interferences between the s - and d - wave radial wave functions , as we have verified qualitatively by the dwba .",
    "nevertheless , the simple one - parameter expression ( [ ratek ] ) provides a reasonable upper bound to the complete calculation which , it will be recalled , requires a calculation involving 205 coupled channels .",
    "the simple formula ( [ ratek ] ) holds , of course , only when both incident and final channels are in the threshold regime . assuming low incident energies",
    ", this restriction therefore limits the size of magnetic field for which ( [ ratek ] ) applies .",
    "namely , this expression is only useful when the zeeman energy splitting between incident and final states remains smaller than the height of the d - wave centrifugal barrier . for the channels considered here , these fields are 2430 gauss and 4860 gauss for the @xmath108 and @xmath109 final states , respectively ; vertical arrows in fig .",
    "3 indicate these field values .",
    "relation ( [ ratek ] ) serves as a useful quick fitting formula for data at smaller fields , and allows us to generalize the results obtained in this paper also to different systems .",
    "possible applications are discussed in section iv .    when stronger values of the magnetic field are considered , the dwba is no longer able to reproduce the full calculation , because the coupling is no longer a weak perturbation .",
    "strong field interaction mixes up different channels leading to a much more complicated picture which can not be explained in terms of a simple two state model .",
    "however , in this limit the loss rate constants seem to be unacceptably large anyway , owing to the effectiveness of spin - rotation coupling in changing spins .",
    "for example , for @xmath16 @xmath50 4800 gauss , the inelastic rate constant for the @xmath67 = @xmath73 exit channel exceeds that for the elastic one .",
    "this indicates that the high field limit fine structure changing collisions represent a potential limitation for the success of the collisional cooling processes .      in this section ,",
    "the dependence of elastic and inelastic rate constants on the collision energy are analyzed for the zero field limit and for three representative values of the field , namely 10 , 200 and 4500 gauss .    in fig .",
    "4.a , we report our results for collision energies 1@xmath44k - 1 k , for the four mentioned values of the field",
    ". elastic scattering , which is largely determined by s - waves in both incident and final channels , is weakly affected by the strength of the field . for spin - changing collisions , however , the energy dependence changes dramatically , in accordance with ( [ ratek ] ) , which is shown in the figure using dashed lines . again",
    "the trends are well - represented , although the formula overestimates the rates due to the zeros in the real rates described in the previous section .    as a general trend",
    ", we observe that when the field is increased , the low - energy inelastic rate constants are substantially pushed up towards the elastic ones , but at higher energies the rates are less sensitive to the field .",
    "this is better illustrated in fig .",
    "4.b , where the total loss rate constants ( that is the sum of the inelastic scattering in the two exothermic channels ) for the different values of the field are plotted together with the elastic channel results in zero field ( which , as stressed before , are essentially independent of the @xmath16 value ) .    in the range of collision energies from 1@xmath44k to 1 k and for low magnetic fields",
    "the rates for elastic collisions remain significantly higher than the rate for the spin - flipping . in particular , at buffer - gas - cooling energies of @xmath110k and below , the inelastic rate constants are in the @xmath111 cm@xmath2/sec range , and remain so even in the presence of a field .",
    "this result verifies the suitability of the @xmath0o@xmath1 molecule for bgc . given the comparatively small uncertainties in the pes @xcite , the results shown here are probably fairly realistic for the he - o@xmath1 system .",
    "we have continued the analysis in the range of collision energies from 1 to 10 k. we note that for energies larger than the height of the centrifugal barrier , the approximation of including only @xmath55 = 1 in the calculation is no longer accurate within a few percent , as was the case at lower energy .",
    "we checked that in this energy range the full calculations including all the possible @xmath55 values provides results which differ ( in the worst case ) by about a factor of 3 for the inelastic channels and by about a factor of 5 for the elastic one .",
    "the full calculation is computationally very expensive for @xmath16 @xmath14 0 , as opposed to the case of zero field where a total-@xmath58 basis can be adopted .",
    "results indicate that inelastic rates for high collision energies are not much lower than elastic rates , and of course become higher still at energies where resonances exist .    at collision energies above 1k",
    "both feshbach and shape resonances appear in the cross sections , as noted in @xcite .",
    "we find that these resonances move somewhat as a function of magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , they are sufficiently narrow that they are completely `` washed out '' by thermal averaging in a gas .",
    "we therefore present these results as a function of temperature rather than energy . to this end",
    "we assume a maxwellian velocity distribution of the collision partners characterized by a kinetic temperature @xmath112 .",
    "the thermally averaged rate constants are then expressed as : @xmath113 where @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath114 stands for cross sections . to compute this average ,",
    "the values of the cross sections for @xmath93 @xmath14 10 k are extrapolated from their values at 10 k.    averaged rate constants are shown in fig . 5 for the same set of field values as in fig .",
    "4 . the condition for magnetic trapping to be successful is usually expressed as @xmath115 @xmath14 10 @xmath116 @xcite , so that we can conclude that for collisions of @xmath0o@xmath1 with @xmath2he this condition is fulfilled at least for temperatures up to 1 kelvin and values of the field for which the asymptotic zeeman splitting does not exceeds the height of the exit channel centrifugal barrier .",
    "even in the absence of detailed information on cold collisions of a particular molecule , the fitting formula ( [ ratek ] ) can be used as an approximate guide to what the rates might be .",
    "for example , we can inquire about the prospects for evaporatively cooling @xmath0o@xmath1 molecules once they have been successfully cooled in a first stage of bgc .",
    "for this system , the d - wave centrifugal barrier height is @xmath117 mk , meaning that the threshold law is expected to hold for field values smaller than @xmath50 53 gauss for transitions that produce one or more molecules in the @xmath73 final state .    in the case of @xmath0o@xmath1 cold collisions",
    "we have access to the zero - field calculations of ref .",
    "we have fit the energy dependence of all the inelastic rate constants to yield the dashed curve labeled `` @xmath118 '' in figure 6 , which represents the total loss .",
    "the full calculation ( solid line ) has some additional features due to scattering resonances near zero energy , but this will not affect our conclusions here . based on the zero - field fit , we use ( [ ratek ] ) to estimate the loss rates in nonzero field .",
    "the general trends are the same , namely , the rates rise sharply at low energy , but are roughly field - independent at larger energies .    for evaporative cooling to be successful requires , roughly speaking , that the ratio of elastic to inelastic collision rates , @xmath119 , exceed 100 @xcite . for the estimated results shown in figure 6",
    ", this condition holds only at energies below @xmath110mk for fields as low as 10 gauss , and not at all for near - critical fields of @xmath120 gauss . thus evaporative cooling from an initially buffer - gas - cooled sample may prove trickier than previously expected .",
    "on the other hand , bgc is characterized by a large number of molecules cooled in the initial step ; it is possible that a certain loss can be tolerated , and that a final sample at sub-@xmath44k temperatures will still hold enough molecules to reach critical phase space density for bec .",
    "detailed kinetic simulations are required to determine if this is so .",
    "alternatively , a recent proposal suggests that nh molecules could be cooled via stark slowing to temperatures as low as 1 mk @xcite . in this case",
    "ec may work quite well .",
    "for many systems of interest to ultracold studies , there does not exist any information on spin - changing collisions at low enough temperatures .",
    "in such cases it may be possible to make order - of - magnitude guesses anyway .",
    "for example , suppose a rate constant is known for higher temperature collisions . in the absence of any other information we could simply assert that the rate has the same value at the energy @xmath101 corresponding to the height of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "the fitting formula ( [ ratek ] ) then gives the behavior of this rate at lower temperatures .",
    "for example , the zero - field rate constant in the first panel of fig .",
    "5 has a value of @xmath121 cm@xmath2/sec at a temperature of 4 k. extrapolating this value down to @xmath122 k yields a coefficient @xmath123 cm@xmath2/sec for the total loss , just a factor of two higher than the fit to the low - energy calculation .",
    "one of the main aims of this paper is to understand in a broad sense collision of paramagnetic molecules in the limit of ultralow temperatures in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this is a part of our effort in showing that molecules with nonzero spin in the lowest energy state ( such as @xmath0o@xmath1 investigated here ) can be successfully cooled and used for bec purposes .",
    "elastic and inelastic scattering in presence of a magnetic field for the specific system @xmath2he - @xmath0o@xmath1 has been characterized in detail .",
    "our attention has been focused on the lowest lying trappable state of the molecule .",
    "this information is immediately relevant for bgc of molecular oxygen , and suggests that the presence of the field does not particularly hinder the bgc process .",
    "this work extends previous predictions which referred to the oxygen molecule in zero field @xcite , and definitely assess the theoretical possibility for trapping this species .",
    "moreover , we have illustrated the simple underlying physics of spin - changing rates in general .",
    "for fields low enough that both the incident and exit channels are in the threshold regime , the rate constants vary according to the wigner - law dependence ( @xmath93 + @xmath102)@xmath124 .",
    "this insight allows us to make estimates of rate constants beyond the ones calculated in detail .",
