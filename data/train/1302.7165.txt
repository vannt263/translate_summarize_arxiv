    "we address this problem within a more general framework : we calculate the entire spectrum for the entanglement , classical , quantum , and total correlations  @xcite for emitters coupled to plasmonic modes .",
    "we demonstrate that it is not entanglement but the quantum correlations ( measured by the discord ) that provide the relevant robust features that could be harnessed for plasmon - assisted information processing .",

    "it has been shown that quantum correlations ( entanglement included )  @xcite and classical correlations  @xcite , in the sense of entropic measures , add up to give the quantum mutual information  @xcite . furthermore , this point has been recently emphasized , via the use of the relative entropy , within a unified framework that captures both quantum and classical correlations within the quantum mutual information  @xcite . for a bipartite system , this can be written as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the von neumann entropy of density matrix @xmath49 .",

    "a typical situation where the dipole - dipole interaction is much greater than the incoherent part @xmath82 [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] can be observed , for example , in a system of diluted molecules of terrilene in a dispersive crystal  @xcite , for which a rich entanglement dynamics has been predicted  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1](a ) shows that correlations reach high values and oscillate rapidly because of the strong dipole - dipole interaction energy @xmath5 ; however , the correlations decay within a short time and the system becomes uncorrelated quite rapidly .",
    "a different scenario , depicted in fig .  [ fig1](b ) , considers a pair of dipoles parallel to each other and perpendicular to their separation vector , which allows the calculation of the collective parameters @xmath5 and @xmath16 directly from eqs .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "although the correlations initially show smaller values than before , they persist for a longer time .",
    "an interesting issue that arises from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is the discrepancy between the entanglement of formation and the concurrence as quantifiers of entanglement .",
    "figure  [ fig1](b ) shows that concurrence reaches much higher values ( and decays much slower ) than the eof ; more surprising is the fact that concurrence reaches , for almost any time , higher values than the total correlations , a result that contrasts with the definition of the mutual information as a quantity that accounts for all the correlations ( classical and quantum ) , entanglement included  @xcite .",
    "thus , within this framework , concurrence can indicate results that are well above the eof , and hence does not allow a direct comparison with other entropic measures such as the quantum discord ; in contrast , the latter can be compared , on the same grounds , to the eof @xcite .",
    "this is explicitly shown in fig .  [ fig1](b ) .",
    "the influence of the plasmonic waveguide is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and can be directly compared with the results in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . according to the relations derived from eqs .",
    "( [ collective ] )  @xcite , one of the parameters @xmath83 or @xmath84 can , in principle , be maximized by ` switching off ' the other one . for the interqubit distance @xmath85 [ fig [ fig2](b ) ] , the plasmonic modes allow for an effective enhancement of correlations , as can be seen from a direct comparison between the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "this said , note that the correlations decay more rapidly in the plasmon - assisted case because here the emitters distance is such that the collective rate is switched off , and the nonlocal effects are purely due to the weak dipole - dipole interaction @xmath83 .",
    "the correlations are enhanced as @xmath86 tends to @xmath87 . for an emitters separation @xmath88",

    "[ fig2](a ) : for this interqubit distance , @xmath83 is switched off and the correlations reach larger values than before and are maintained for a much longer time .",
    "we also point out that for the parameter window considered in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , classical correlations do not play a major role .",
    ", @xmath91 m , obtained for an operational wavelength @xmath92 nm ; this gives @xmath93 , and a plasmonic wavelength @xmath94 nm .",
    "( a ) separation between emitters @xmath95 , @xmath96 , ( b ) @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "the inset corresponds to case ( b ) , but in the absence of laser pumping .",
    "the notations for the graphs are as given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . ]",
    "interestingly , the quantum discord , which is in its essence different to entanglement , does play a role ( and is more robust than the eof ) during the qubit dissipative evolution .",
    "we remark that is not only the existence of quantum correlations , but the way they relate to each other , that matters , since the latter can lead to operational interpretations  @xcite .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows that for a time @xmath100 , entanglement , as calculated by the eof , has almost vanished and the quantum discord quickly approximates to the value given by the total correlations .",
    "in contrast to this , ref .  @xcite uses the concurrence to show that a large amount of entanglement is generated for this set of parameters .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , where it is evident that the concurrence approximately equals the total correlations , in clear contrast to what is shown by the eof . within the formal framework of correlations presented here ,",
    "the emitters entanglement is well below that reported in ref .",
    "this is consistent with the approach of entropic measures followed here .",
    "furthermore , it is straightforward to show that the density matrix computed at @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) corresponds to the mixed state @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the subradiant state .",
    "this state has a very small contribution from the entangled state @xmath104 , and so it provides a small degree of entanglement .",
    "however , the mixture of this with the product state @xmath105 , produces a quantum correlated state with a type of correlation  the so - called quantum discord , which is different , in its very essence , to entanglement  @xcite .",
    "although a larger value of @xmath86 can enhance entanglement as well as the other correlations ( not shown ) , we point out that care must be taken when choosing such a parameter ; in particular , the value @xmath106 used in @xcite is not realistically attainable according to the plasmon dispersion relation reported there for @xmath88 . indeed , if we include the ` best ' achievable @xmath107 factor , in the expression for @xmath108 , the relation between the plasmonic wavelength and the propagation length should read @xmath109 , but from the known dispersion relation  @xcite , no pair @xmath110 satisfies this constraint .",
    "this simple estimation leads us to conclude that , if @xmath111 , the largest correct realistic value that should be used for the considered emitters separation is @xmath112 .    , and initial state @xmath113 .",
    "( b ) quantum discord dynamics for @xmath114 , and initial state configurations @xmath115 .",
    "( c ) comparison between qd , cc , and eof for @xmath116 . in all graphs , @xmath117 , @xmath96 , @xmath118 , and @xmath91 m . ]",
    "the qubit correlation dynamics due to the collective effects arising from the emitters coupling to the plasmon modes , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , become even more interesting when they are pumped with a continuous laser field of amplitude @xmath119 and frequency @xmath120 ( targetting the emitter @xmath11 ) .",
    "if we consider the laser excitation to be in resonance with the emitters transition frequency @xmath121 , stationary correlations can be obtained by making the amplitudes @xmath122 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) for a distance @xmath123 , @xmath124 . in the same spirit",
    ", a higher stationary behaviour of correlations is obtained for @xmath125 , by introducing a relative phase between the laser amplitudes : @xmath126 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "the correlations are much larger than those obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) because the laser excitation assists the very slow decay of the ` naturally created ' antisymmetric state @xmath127 .",
    "this figure  also shows that the concurrence reaches higher values than the total correlations , which might be seen as inappropriate when compared to the use of entropic metrics .",
    "we have shown that rather than entanglement , quantum discord is the most robust correlation during the dissipative dynamics , and , depending on the separation between emitters , the qubit - plasmon modes coupling can enhance the degree of correlations via the collective parameter @xmath84 . for the sake of completeness , in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) we consider , for a fixed laser amplitude , the role of the initial state preparation on the correlations dynamics . here",
    ", we plot the quantum discord as a function of time , for initial states @xmath128 , @xmath129 . although it is clear that , at @xmath130 , the discord takes the value 1 for @xmath131 , we have plotted it only for a range up to @xmath132 , in order to appreciate comparatively the correlations behaviour for all @xmath133 .",
    "the trend in correlations is clearly influenced by @xmath133 but , overall , the states converge to a common stationary value . the quantum discord , classical correlations , and eof are plotted for the particular case @xmath134 in fig .  [ fig3](c ) , showing how an increment in the laser amplitude may produce a noticeable difference between the quantum discord and entanglement ( eof ) .",
    "thus , pumping with a continuous laser field can be used as an additional means to dynamically control the relationship between entanglement and the quantum correlations present in the emitters .",
    "such a fact could be used as an important resource in the realisation of non - conventional quantum protocols  @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind that the quantum correlation , as measured by the discord , gives the amount of information that is not accessible to local measurement , our results show that most of the information stored in the emitters is purely quantum ( compare the thin - solid blue with the doubly - dashed green lines in all the figures ) . also , we note that , in most cases , this type of information does not arise from entanglement , which is kept to a minimum , as can be seen in fig.s  [ fig1](b ) , [ fig2](a ) , and [ fig3](c ) .",
    "this said , a possible optical control of the amount and class of induced quantum correlations can be carried out with external laser pumping , as depicted in fig .",
    "a comparison of the two physical scenarios considered here emitters dissipative dynamics in the i ) absence and ii ) presence of coupling to a plasmonic bus leads us to the following . in the former case , the correlations exhibit a longer lifetime in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) because of the presence of the incoherent interaction @xmath16 for the distance @xmath135 ; this means that the lifetime of the symmetric correlated state @xmath136 ( an eigenstate of the bare hamiltonian @xmath137 ) is more robust ( @xmath138 ) . in the latter scenario , @xmath139 and the correlations",
    "are only mediated by the coherent interaction @xmath83 .",
    "the plasmon - mediated coupled emitters become more interesting because for large distances ( @xmath140 ) , the incoherent decay @xmath84 can take values close to @xmath141 , holding the correlations for longer times .",
    "a particular case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) : @xmath142 , @xmath143 , hence @xmath83 is ` switched off ' .",
    "the correlations are present even for times of the order of @xmath144 thanks to the slow decay @xmath145 of the antisymmetric state @xmath146 . for this time scale ,",
    "entanglement ( as measured by the eof ) is almost zero , and the correlation that prevails is the quantum discord , which in turn tends to the same value as the total correlations .    aside from the physics that arises in the qubit - plasmon setup here",
    "considered , we highlight the discrepancy between the eof and the concurrence as quantifiers of the emitters entanglement .",
    "this is due to the entropic origin of the eof compared to that of concurrence ( the difference between the two is explicitly stated in eq .  [ eofr ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in most of the plots of this work , the concurrence is larger than the mutual information ( purple lines ) in several different time frames .",
    "since the quantum mutual information captures all the possible correlations ( entanglement included ) , this result seems incorrect .",
    "again , the explanation for this lies in the fact that the concurrence does not have an entropic origin like the other correlation measurements calculated here . strictly speaking",
    ", the concurrence is an entanglement monotone but is not an ` actual ' entanglement metric in the sense that it obtains its meaning from its relation to the entanglement of formation and not the opposite @xcite . with the emergence of quantum correlations beyond the entanglement",
    ", it is crucial to coherently quantify the latter in order to give a consistent physical interpretation of quantum phenomena .",
    "the understanding of whether a qubit system is entangled or discord - correlated is thus relevant for deciding the way in which the emitters could be operated as a physical device for performing information processing tasks .",
    "the relation between the correlations and the physical properties of the hybrid system analyzed here is clearly showed in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig3 ] : the lifetime of the correlations is enhanced thanks to the illumination with the coherent laser field ; also , a large @xmath42-factor ( due to the plasmon channel ) increases the degree of correlations , especially that of the quantum discord .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that an adequate manipulation of the light - matter interaction strength allows control of the dynamics followed by the quantum discord and entanglement , and therefore of their metric value .",
    "this degree of quantum control is possible due to the interplay between the laser illumination intensity and the coherent emitter - emitter interaction @xcite .",
    "we have computed entanglement , classical , quantum , and total correlations for a hybrid system composed of largely separated emitters coupled to the plasmonic modes of a one - dimensional waveguide , which is externally driven by a laser field .",
    "we have illustrated , by direct calculation , that classical correlations are the least assisted by the plasmon bus and that quantum discord is the dominant correlation that prevails throughout the whole dissipative dynamics and that this is enhanced by the presence of the plasmonic collective excitations and by the external laser pumping .",
    "this tendency in the correlations has been analytically demonstrated for bare emitters coupled to the vacuum electromagnetic field in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have emphasized the entropic origin of the entanglement of formation , the quantum discord , and that of the quantum mutual information as quantifiers of correlations ; we also computed the concurrence for direct comparison of our results with those reported in @xcite .",
    "we found that the latter can reach values well above the eof and the total correlations .",
    "this shows that care must be taken when confronting or using specific quantifiers of entanglement for describing a physical process , especially because the interpretation of the eof as the cost of creation of an entangled state ( with no regularization ) , leads to an upper bound on the actual degree of entanglement in a quantum system  @xcite .",
    "we remark that a crucial feature of the mechanism devised here is the large separation between emitters ( of the order of or greater than the plasmons wavelength ) , which could lead to long - distance quantum control and communication : the correlations are purely generated via the strong plasmon - emitters interaction , which in turn is reflected in the functional dependence of the collective parameters given by eq .",
    "( [ collective ] ) .",
    "an interesting by - product is the feasibility of tailoring the phase difference that exists between the collective parameters , which might allow the switching on / off of the emitters correlations . here , a parameter configuration where either @xmath147 or @xmath46 goes to zero , an appropriate choice of initial conditions and laser tailoring , enables the enhancement or suppression of the existing correlations .",
    "this result is beyond the scope of this work and will be addressed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated the control of light - matter interaction by means of plasmonic resonators @xcite and silver nanowires @xcite to enable the enhancement of the purcell effect in quantum emitters , and the strength of the coupling to the plasmonic modes of such nanostructures .",
    "this offers the possibility of testing the results here reported with state - of - the - art technology .",
    "furthermore , another experimental demonstration of communication between two distant single emitters ( organic molecules ) via single photons has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "thus , the setup proposed in this work has also the potential for demonstrating an additional degree of quantum control in which sensitive quantum information encoded in single photons can be transmitted and processed between coupled ( but largely separated ) single emitters .",
