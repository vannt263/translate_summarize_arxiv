    "studies of fluid behavior at the micro- and nanoscales has resulted in the growing understanding that fluid mechanics at such small scales differs in fundamental ways from fluid mechanics in the macroscopic world [ gad - el hak , 1999 ] .",
    "one of the fundamental assumptions in fluid mechanics is the no - slip boundary condition : that the tangential component of the fluid velocity equals that of the solid at the wall .",
    "recent advances in micro- and nanoscale experiments and molecular simulations have shown that slip of the fluid on the solid surface occurs at small scales , and thus the traditional no - slip boundary condition can not be applied at these scales [ barrat and bocquet , 1999 ; baudry _ et al . _ , 2001 ; choi _ et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; joseph and tabeling , 2005 ; thompson and robbins , 1990 ; thompson and troian , 1997 ] .",
    "many other experimental and theoretical studies demonstrating the slip phenomenon have been recently reviewed by whitby and quirke [ 2007 ] and rothstein [ 2010 ] , along with other small scale fluid dynamics phenomena such as surface roughness , non - wettability , dissolved molecules , corrugation and altered shear rate .",
    "et al . _ [ 2005 ] explained the most evident mechanisms by which both true slip ( where fluid molecules are effectively sliding on the solid surface ) and apparent slip ( where the slip occurs not at the solid / fluid interface but in the thin depleted fluid / fluid interface layer near the solid boundary ) . for water over hydrophobic surfaces , or for any liquid for which the surface is less attractive than the bulk of the fluid ( i.e. , a non - wetting fluid - solid interface ) , there is an especially large slip at the fluid - solid interface with corresponding drag reduction properties , that is promising for a wide range of fluid dynamics and heat transfer applications such as liquid cooling for microelectronics [ ou _ et al .",

    "whether a fluid is a liquid or gas the magnitude of the slip at the wall can be quantified by the slip length , @xmath0 , at solid surfaces [ thompson and troian , 1997 ] .",
    "nearly two centuries ago navier proposed a generalized boundary condition that incorporates the possibility of fluid slip at the solid surface .",
    "it assumes that the slip velocity is proportional to the shear stress at the wall via the slip length .",
    "its equivalent form for gases agrees with the kinetic theory of gases , which equates the slip length with the mean free path of the gas .",
    "one of the most important dimensionless physical parameters for fluid flows through microtubes is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the radius of the tube ( it is called the knudsen number for gases , and in that case @xmath0 is the mean free path ) .",
    "both gas and liquid flow measurements show dramatic enhancements in flux rates over those predicted with classical continuum no - slip flow models [ neto _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; whitby and quirke , 2007 ] .",
    "et al . _ [ 2005 ] observed that the measured flow rates through carbon nanotubes were four to five orders of magnitude greater than what was predicted by hydrodynamics models .",
    "the authors also showed that the slip lengths , which are much greater than the tube diameter , are consistent with a nearly frictionless interface due to the lower molecular corrugation .",
    "similar observations were reported by cheng and gordanio [ 2002 ] .",
    "experiments overwhelmingly show that the presence of a slip velocity on the boundary can play an important role in small scale fluid devices .",
    "theoretical solutions to various flow problems for newtonian fluids with slip boundary conditions have been obtained and are available in the literature [ karniadakis _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ] .",
    "fluid flows through rigid microtubes have been studied in the slip flow regime [ sbragaglia and prosperetti , 2007 ] , and this study determined that an effective navier slip boundary condition is valid .",
    "other studies have investigated steady - state [ matthews and hill , 2007 ] and transient [ wu _ et al .",

    "et al . _ [ 2008 ] showed that the influence of boundary - slip on the flow behavior is different for different types of pressure gradients driving the flow .",
    "since there is no wave motion in the rigid tubes , the fluids oscillate in the bulk , and hence the effect of wave propagation was not modeled in those studies .",
    "unsteady flow characteristics and wave propagation through elastic tubes has been studied on the macroscale [ wormersly , 1955 ; zamir , 2000 ] .",
    "there is no corresponding study in the literature , however , for the micro- or nanoscale .",
    "pulsatile microfluidics is a widely unexplored area and the difference in the dynamics at the macro- and microscales remains to be quantified .",

    "in particular , we derive an analytical solution for transient flows through elastic microtubes with navier slip boundary conditions .",
    "the nonlinear influence of the slip length on the material deformation of the fluid significantly affects the velocity profiles , flow rates , and shear stress distributions in the system .",
    "our results may be useful to researchers in the microfluidic device and biology communities for understanding the effects of pulsatile flow dynamics , elastic conduits , and slip velocities in internal flows at small scales .",

    "it can also be seen that for small wo the fluid reaches a steady state at all times before the pressure changes , and therefore a quasi - steady state is reached , and , correspondingly , a poiseuille velocity profile .",
    "finally , we consider the normalized axial velocity contours for elastic microtubes with two different tube length to wave length ratios . fig .",
    "[ fig : c - a ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : c - b ] present the @xmath145 and @xmath150 cases , respectively .",
    "these figures include axial velocity fields for two different frequency parameters , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 , and a slip ratio of @xmath130 is used in each of them . concerning the harmonic oscillations , we plot only one phase state of the axial velocity fields of interest in one time period ( @xmath133 ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : c - a ] , the wave completes its cycle in space if the wavelength and tube length are equal .",
    "as discussed earlier , the velocity profiles become more parabolic when wo is small .",
    "increasing wo affects the flow field by effectively increasing the ratio of oscillatory inertial forces to shear forces .",
    "the effect of the slip length as a function of wo can be seen in the figures , and it is clear that it interacts nonlinearly with the pulsatile flow dynamics .",
    "the influence of a slip velocity on the flow characteristics in circular elastic microtubes is investigated using a continuum approach with navier slip boundary conditions .",
    "analytical solutions of the pulsatile flow dynamics in a small tube are found by taking into account the coupling between the fluid motion and the elastic deformation of the tube wall .",
    "the formulation derived here can be reduced to the womersley solution for elastic tubes as a special case by setting the slip length equal to zero .",
    "in addition to that , by setting the elasticity factor @xmath123 along with a infinite wave propagation speed , we also recover the classical solution for oscillatory flows through rigid pipes .",
    "the influence of slip boundary conditions on the flow through tubes for pulsatile flows is qualitatively different than for steady flow with a constant pressure gradient , wherein slip boundary conditions only result in an added translational effect , without changing the material deformation of the fluid . with an unsteady pressure gradient , however , the influence of slip boundary conditions becomes nonlinear and affects the flow rate , velocity profile , and shear stress , by altering the material deformation in the fluid .",
    "there are large differences between flows in elastic and rigid tubes , especially if the tube length and the wavelength are on the same order .",
    "it is already well established that the wall movements in an elastic tube make it easier for the flow to move through the tube than through a comparable rigid tube .",
    "solutions for rigid tubes do not have any wave motion , so velocity profiles at different sections are the same for the same point in the oscillation period ( the wave propagation speed @xmath124 ) .",
    "there are wave motions in elastic tubes due to finite wave propagation speeds , however , and this phenomena can be easily seen when the tube length is comparable to the wave length .    in this study",
    ", we demonstrated that the presence of slip at the elastic microtube wall enhances flow through the tube .",
    "this effect is not just an additional translational velocity , but shows nonlinear behavior and affects the material deformation in the flow field .",
    "additionally , we confirmed that the elasticity of the tube wall also has a positive effect on the flow rate .",
    "there is always an increase in flow rate for elastic tubes compared to the inelastic case , and the peak value of the percent change in flow rate increases with increasing slip length .",
    "the effective range of the frequency parameter wo decreases , however , with increasing slip length , and the corresponding value of wo at this peak value also decreases with increasing slip length . in summary ,",
    "the presence of velocity slip at the microtube surface has important , nontrivial effects on the velocity profiles .",
    "it changes the amount of the phase shift between the fluid inertial motion and the pressure gradient , and alters the material deformation of the media .",
