    "in this paper we study a random graph model where each vertex of the graph carries a random symbol , spin or color .",
    "the easiest model of this kind is that of an erds  rnyi graph where additionally each vertex is equipped with an independently chosen color .",
    "the more general models of colored random graphs we consider here allow for a dependence between color and connectivity of the vertices .",
    "with each colored graph we associate its _ empirical neighborhood measure _ , which records the number of vertices of a given color with a given number of adjacent vertices of each color . from this quantity",
    "one can derive a host of important characteristics of the colored graph , like its degree distribution , the number of edges linking two given colors , or the number of isolated vertices of any color .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive a large deviation principle for the empirical neighborhood measure .    to be more specific about our model , we consider colored random graphs constructed as follows : in the first step each of @xmath0 fixed vertices independently gets a color , chosen according to some law @xmath1 on the finite set @xmath2 of colors . in the second step",
    "we connect any pair of vertices independently with a probability @xmath3 depending on the colors @xmath4 of the two vertices .",
    "this model , which comprises the simple erds  rnyi graph with independent colors as a special case , was introduced by penman in his thesis @xcite ( see @xcite for an exposition ) and rediscovered later by sderberg @xcite .",
    "it is also a special case of the inhomogeneous random graphs studied in @xcite .",
    "our main concern in this paper are asymptotic results when the number @xmath0 of vertices goes to infinity , while the connection probabilities are of order @xmath5 .",
    "this leads to an average number of edges of order @xmath0 , the _ near critical _ or _ sparse _ case .",
    "our methods also allow the study of the sub- and supercritical regimes .",
    "some results on these cases are discussed in @xcite .",
    "recall that a _ rate function _ is a nonconstant , lower semicontinuous function @xmath6 from a polish space @xmath7 into @xmath8 $ ] , it is called _ good _ if the level sets @xmath9 are compact for every @xmath10 . a functional @xmath11 from the set of finite colored graphs to @xmath7",
    "is said to satisfy a _ large deviation principle _ with rate function @xmath6 if , for all borel sets @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 under @xmath15 is a colored random graph with @xmath0 vertices and int @xmath16 and @xmath17 refer to the interior , respectively , closure , of the set @xmath16 .",
    "apart from the empirical neighborhood measure defined above , we also consider the _ empirical pair measure _ , which counts the number of edges connecting any given pair of colors , and the _ empirical color measure _ , which simply counts the number of vertices of any given color .",
    "the main result of this paper is a joint large deviation principle for the empirical neighborhood measure and the empirical pair measure of a colored random graph in the weak topology ; see theorem [ main2 ] .",
    "in the course of the proof of this principle , two further interesting large deviation principles are established : a large deviation principle for the empirical neighborhood measure conditioned to have a given empirical pair and color measure ( see theorem [ main3 ] ) and a joint large deviation principle for the empirical color measure and the empirical pair measure ; see theorem [ main](b ) . for all these principles we obtain a completely explicit rate function given in terms of relative entropies .",
    "our motivation for this project is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", one may consider the colored random graphs as a very simple random model of _ networked data_. the data is described as a text of fixed length , consisting of words chosen from a finite dictionary , together with a random number of unoriented edges or links connecting the words .",
    "large deviation results for the empirical neighborhood measure permit the calculation of the asymptotic number of bits needed to transmit a large amount of such data with arbitrarily small error probability ; see @xcite where this idea is followed up .",
    "on the other hand , we are working toward understanding simple models of _ statistical mechanics _ defined on random graphs . here ,",
    "typically , the colors of the vertices are interpreted as spins , taken from a finite set of possibilities , and the hamiltonian of the system is an integral of some function with respect to the empirical neighborhood measure .",
    "as a very simple example we provide the annealed asymptotics of the random partition function for the ising model on an erds  rnyi graph , as the graph size goes to infinity .    as a more substantial example , we consider the erds  rnyi graph model on @xmath0 vertices , where edges are inserted with probability @xmath18 $ ] independently for any pair of vertices .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 . from our main result",
    "we derive a large deviation principle for the degree distribution ; see corollary [ erdd ] .",
    "this example seems to be new in this explicit form .",
    "let @xmath20 be a fixed set of @xmath0 vertices , say @xmath21 and denote by @xmath22 the set of all ( simple ) graphs with vertex set @xmath21 and edge set @xmath23 , where the _ formal _ ordering of edges is introduced as a means to describe simply _ unordered _ edges .",

    "given the colors , we connect any two vertices @xmath29 , independently of everything else , with _ connection probability _ @xmath30 . we always consider @xmath31 under the joint law of graph and color and interpret @xmath14 as colored random graph .",
