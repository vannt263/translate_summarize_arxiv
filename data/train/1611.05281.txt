    "the structure and success of general relativity have lead us to the believe that the spin-2 graviton field mediates quantum gravitational interactions ; but to date this believe has eluded experimental detection . furthermore , the quantum limit of general relativity fails to renormalize properly forcing us to further believe that general relativity comes from a classical projection of a 10 dimensional string .",
    "on the other hand , we know that the geometrical object that describes the geodesics in general relativity is the connection and not the metric which enters that construction only after arbitrarily imposing the metric compatibility constraint",
    ". then , we can in practice construct a quantum theory of gravity where the fundamental field is the connection as in@xcite or a similar object as we do here .",
    "nothing but experimental observation constrains these possibilities .",
    "therefore , we should not force the graviton upon ourselves and instead focus on matching the proposed model s differential cross sections to experimental evidence ; more so , when we must yet detect the particle mediating gravitational interactions .    here",
    "we present quantum gravitodynamics , qgd , the only renormalizable 4-dimensional theory that reproduces the interactions in general relativity to @xmath2 and couples to the standard model through a covariant derivative like the other three interactions in nature . as we show below , all diagrams in qgd",
    "match those of it counterpart in general relativity to @xmath2 and the potential that determines a test particle s classical trajectories , are identical for both theories to that same order .",
    "as opposed to general relativity which does not renormalize , qgd has a metric void of any dynamics , explicitly lacks a graviton field or any spin-2 state , and instead uses so(4 ) yang mills fields coupled to spinor singlets to mediate the gravitational interactions .",
    "furthermore , qgd reproduces all diagrams in general relativity to @xmath2 and therefore all experimental evidence to that same order .",
    "however , as opposed to general relativity , the terms in the qgd lagrangian involve products of fields and their derivatives with total dimensionality of at most four and therefore renormalization follows@xcite .",
    "thus , qgd is renormalizable , and , like general relativity , constructed in 4 dimensions .",
    "because qgd is defined in terms of yang mills fields , it also couples naturally to the standard model to produce a unified model with @xmath3 gauge symmetry that reproduces all the experimentally observed differential cross sections in nature , including those produced by gravitational interactions to @xmath2 .",
    "qgd also has the ability to fit those diagrams contributions from gravity that may become available in the future such as higgs - gluon gravitational scattering .",
    "in addition , qgd has gravitational su(2 ) yang mills bps states that match the entropy of black holes and type - ii strings .",
    "pure yang s gravity@xcite has similar classical equations to those of einstein s relativity and includes schwarzschild - like solutions , whose singularity at the horizon , as opposed to black hole solutions , can not be removed through a coordinate transformation@xcite .",
    "qgd and yang s gravity are both constructed in terms of the same connection defined over a fiber bundle , however , yang s gravity is not renormalizable because it couples its yang - mills field directly to the energy - momentum tensor . instead , in qgd , the yang mills fields couple to matter through a @xmath4 covariant derivative , in the same manner as the other forces in nature and which preserves renormalization .",
    "therefore , the couplings in qgd ensure that all terms in the lagrangian have dimensionality four or less which guarantees renormalization@xcite .",
    "string theory is the only other theory , besides qgd , to incorporate gravitational interactions while preserving renormalization .",
    "it has been a successful gravitational theory , because like qgd , scattering processes associated with the @xmath5-function constrain the metric to be a solution of einstein s equation .",
    "therefore , like qgd it reproduces all general relativity tests to @xmath2 . like strings , qgd has the necessary bps states to resolve the black hole entropy problem .",
    "however , unlike qgd , string theory can not be defined without ambiguity in 4 dimensions and neither can it couple to the standard model which instead must be reformulated along side gravity .",
    "the qgd connection defined on the so(4 ) fiber bundle can be projected to the connection defined on the so(1,3 ) tangent bundle .",
    "this projection allows the generators of the so(4 ) gauge fields to be defined in terms of dirac gamma matrices @xmath6,\\label{so4g}\\ ] ] and therefore these generators do not commute with the spacetime dirac @xmath7 matrices .",
    "this non - commutativity contrasts qgd from the other gauge theories in the standard model because it introduces terms proportional to @xmath8 $ ] which couple to fermionic matter fields with arbitrary couplings .",
    "the map from the so(4 ) gravitational gauge field , @xmath9 , to the spin - connection defined in@xcite motivate calling @xmath9 the connecton .    in order to test qgd",
    ", we must reproduce the experimental evidence supporting general relativity .",
    "as discussed at the end of section 4 , this also suffices to show that qgd will reproduce all effects of general relativity to @xmath2 .",
    "the procedure used to fit qed to experimental evidence , see for example@xcite , transfers well to qgd and permits the fitting of all the qgd parameters to experimental observation .",
    "the t - matrix calculation in@xcite associated with the tree - level @xmath10 scattering process produces a differential cross section ; comparison of that differential cross section with the one obtained from the schroedinger equation with a coulomb potential allows the fitting of the electron coupling found in qed to the experimentally measured charge used in the coulomb potential .",
    "this procedure extends to the quantized but non - renormalizable general relativity theory .",
    "in@xcite the tree - level scattering process for two bosons , @xmath11 , produces a differential scattering matrix which fits the schroedinger equation with a newton potential while the 1-loop scattering correction fits the differential cross section produced by the schroedinger equation with the leading classical post newtonian correction to the potential .",
    "the strategy implemented in@xcite and@xcite was also successfully implemented to the gravitational sector in string theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus , matching the model s differential cross sections to experimental / expected differential cross sections allows us to test if a model correctly describes nature .    here",
    "we follow the same strategy as that used in@xcite-@xcite to show that qgd coupled to the standard model fits all the known experimental differential cross sections , including those gravitational in nature .",
    "section 2 details the symmetries and action derived for a single matter field and the u(1 ) electromagnetic field , both coupled to gravity . in section 3 we calculate the propagators and vertices of the model presented in section 2 . in section 4",
    "we calculate t - matrix elements to produce differential cross sections which are then fitted to the differential cross section of the schroedinger equations with the coulomb , the newtonian and post newtonian potentials as well as the differential cross section for the deflection of light by a point particle in the small angle approximation found in general relativity .",
    "section 5 presents the full qgd coupling to the standard model while section 6 fits the differential cross sections to experimentally observed differential cross sections .",
    "section 7 moves outside the realm of experimental observation and shows that qgd can include the expected gravitational interactions of the su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge bosons as well as the higgs doublet . in section 8",
    "we consider the isomorphic @xmath12 yang mills representation of qgd , which when @xmath13 supersymmetrized has bps states whose entropy corresponds to that of a black hole , and that can bridge to type - ii strings@xcite .",
    "the conclusions appear in section 9 .",
    "the fundamental geometrical object of general relativity , the connection on the tangent bundle , does not require a metric to describe a particle s geodesics .",
    "consistent with general relativity and in the spirit of@xcite , qgd chooses a connection over the metric as the fundamental field .",
    "qgd does not use a yet to be detected graviton field or spin-2 particle and it uses instead a constant metric void of any dynamics .",
    "instead , connections defined on the so(4 ) fiber bundle mediate all gravitational interactions ; these so(4 ) gauge fields alone mediates all the gravitational interactions between particles .",
    "these fields suffice to obtain all the differential cross sections expected from general relativity for a single matter - photon system .",
    "more importantly , this construction does not have any experimental impediments because we have yet to detect the graviton or any other spin-2 particle .",
    "we present the lagrangian @xmath14\\psi.\\label{lagf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use the following conventions .",
    "the diagonal and flat space - time metric , @xmath15 , does not carry any dynamics and has signature @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 represents the levi - civita tensor in 4 dimensions .",
    "the vielbeins @xmath18 connect space - time coordinates ( greek indices ) with the so(4 ) fiber bundle coordinates ( latin indices ) .",
    "in particular @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the metric @xmath21 , defined on the fiber bundle , has signature @xmath22 .",
    "we define the field strengths appearing in ( [ lagb ] ) @xmath23 @xmath24 represents the u(1 ) electromagnetic gauge field and the so(4 ) gauge field @xmath25 , the connecton , mediates of gravitational interactions .",
    "the couplings @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote coupling constants and @xmath30 . with @xmath31",
    "defined as a copy of a textbook so(n=4 ) gauge field necessarily antisymmetric in indices @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then @xmath34 so that the indispensable property @xmath35 holds .",
    "the covariant derivative operator @xmath36 defined in ( [ lagf ] ) acts on a 4 dimensional dirac spinor field @xmath37 @xmath38 and depends on the so(4 ) generators @xmath39 defined in ( [ so4 g ] ) .",
    "the u(1 ) local gauge transformation @xmath40 , with @xmath41 a scalar function , acts on the following fields @xmath42 which also transforms the covariant derivative in the standard way @xmath43 but leaves ( [ lagtodo ] ) unchanged .",

    "the so(1,3 ) local gauge transformations acting on the fermions have the same effect as the so(4 ) transformation because @xmath48 however , the so(1,3 ) gauge transformations , can not act on the pure yang - mills lagrangian because the cartan - killing metric for that gauge group , given by the trace over two group elements , is not positive definite which yields states not bounded from below@xcite .",
    "this property therefore distinguishes theories defined over the tangent bundle with local so(1,3 ) symmetry from those defined over the fiber bundle with local so(4 ) symmetry .",
    "the former can not be used to define yang - mills theories even when the fiber bundles can be projected to the tangent bundle . for the avoidance of doubt , gravitational theories like spin - gravity can be defined over the tangent bundle only because , as a result of the different construction from yang - mills , their spectrum does not become unbounded from below when the cartan - killing metric is not positive definite .",
    "the lorenz gauge fixings @xmath49 and property ( [ prop1 ] ) simplify the quadratic component in ( [ lagb ] ) to @xmath50    the structure constant defined in@xcite @xmath51 simplifies the relevant terms of the cubic terms in ( [ lagb ] ) to @xmath52 the terms in ( [ lag13 ] ) take the form @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in the low energy limit the photon momentum , @xmath55 , and the connecton momentum , @xmath56 , satisfy @xmath57 or equivalently @xmath58 this condition accounts for the omission of all other terms .",
    "for example , for matter - photon scattering the vertex generated by @xmath59 would only participate at 1-loop level , would necessarily appear twice and thus takes values proportional to the square of the connecton momentum . instead , the vertices produced by the second term in ( [ lag13 ] ) would appear first at tree - level and then at 1-loop level where it would contribute terms proportional to the photon momentum and its square respectively .",
    "dimensional analysis of general relativity shows that it does not renormalize properly .",
    "however , it follows from ( [ eq1a ] ) that the connecton has the same dimensionality as the u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "therefore , the terms in the lagrangian ( [ lag12 ] ) and ( [ lag13 ] ) involve products of fields and their derivatives with total dimensionality four or less .",
    "renormalization then follows as shown in@xcite .",
    "since @xmath60\\ne0 $ ] , we use the relation @xmath61 to express @xmath62\\psi&=&g \\bar\\psi\\bar\\omega_{\\;\\;\\;\\;\\mu}^{\\mu a}\\gamma_a\\psi.\\label{lf2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that ( [ lf2 ] ) does not depend on @xmath63 .",
    "this means that gauge invariance constrains ( [ lf1 ] ) but not ( [ lf2 ] ) .",
    "thus the rescaling of ( [ lf1 ] ) by a constant redefines the coupling .",
    "however , the redefinition guarantees gauge invariance only after a subsequent redefinition of the spinor @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "a recalling by a constant , even a complex one , of ( [ lf2 ] ) does not affect gauge invariance .",
    "this contrasts with su(2 ) of su(3 ) couplings where the dirac matrices commute with their generators and therefore ( [ lf2 ] ) necessarily vanishes .    the relations ( [ lf1 ] ) and ( [ lf2 ] ) simplify the lagrangian ( [ lagf ] ) to @xmath64    here",
    "the real coupling constants @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath28 adjust the theory to observation . in particular",
    "@xmath26 represents the electric charge and gauge invariance constrains @xmath27 and coincides with the coupling constant found in the purely bosonic sector ( [ lag13 ] ) . instead ,",
    "gauge invariance does not constrain @xmath28 which can take any value , real , purely imaginary or complex .",
    "again , the terms in the lagrangian ( [ lag2 ] ) involve products of fields and their derivatives with total dimensionality four or less . therefore , the terms in the lagrangians ( [ lag12 ] ) , ( [ lag13 ] ) and ( [ lag2 ] ) , and thus lagrangian ( [ lagtodo ] ) , involve products of fields and their derivatives with total dimensionality four or less .",
    "renormalization then follows as shown in@xcite .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath65 has an complex coupling constant @xmath28 while @xmath66 has a real coupling constant @xmath27 .",
    "then , self energy corrections can have imaginary contributions and therefore it would be tempting to assume that the probability density determined by the wavefunction decreases over time and unitarity is lost .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "we choose a pure real @xmath27 and a pure imaginary @xmath28 and will show when fitting theory to experiment in the subsequent sections that @xmath67 where @xmath68 represents the gravitational constant .",
    "the self - energy contributions to @xmath69 for both bosons @xmath24 and @xmath9 come from purely bosonic diagrams and those with fermionic loops .",
    "we construct the purely bosonic diagrams with vertex ( c ) and vertex ( d ) defined in section [ pv1 ] .",
    "therefore , the diagrams depend only on the real valued coupling constant @xmath27 @xmath70 @xmath71 thus , those diagrams always contribute real amounts to the self energies @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . as we show below , real contributions to the self energy",
    "do not affect unitarity .",
    "the diagrams involving fermionic loops always involve an even number of vertices ( a ) or an even number of vertices ( b ) defined in section [ pv1 ] .",
    "therefore , corrections to @xmath69 to the self energies of both @xmath24 and @xmath9 always contribute even powers of @xmath28 @xmath76 @xmath77 for some real constants @xmath78 and @xmath79 . even though the coupling @xmath28 is imaginary , all corrections to the self energies for both bosons @xmath24 and @xmath9 contribute real amounts to @xmath69 , even more , because fermions always appear in loops regardless of the order of perturbation , the self energy corrections to the bosons @xmath24 and @xmath9 always remain real .",
    "on the other hand , the contributions to the self energies of the fermion contribute real amounts to @xmath80 but complex amounts to @xmath69 .",
    "the contribution to the fermion self energy to @xmath80 comes from diagrams constructed from a pair of vertices ( a ) or a pair of vertices ( b ) .",
    "therefore @xmath81 for some real constants @xmath82 and @xmath83 . the first imaginary contribution comes from the diagram involving one vertex ( c ) and three vertices ( a ) .",
    "therefore @xmath84 therefore , the leading imaginary correction to the fermion self energy contributes at most of @xmath69 .",
    "the time evolution of the wavefunction for the fermion @xmath85 where @xmath86 describes the wavefunction at the emitter and @xmath87 represents the wavefunction at the detector , implies that the probability density at time @xmath88 , @xmath89 , decays as @xmath90 when @xmath91 particles are lost as they travel between emitter and detector .",
    "this experimentally unobserved reduction in flux prevents large imaginary values of @xmath92 .",
    "however , when @xmath93 satisfies @xmath94 then , the self energy @xmath95 can take on imaginary values without loss of unitarity .",
    "since the leading imaginary correction to the self energy of the fermion contributes at most @xmath69 , then , @xmath96 whenever @xmath97 years .",
    "bearing in mind that the universe has existed less than @xmath98 years and that estimates put the the proton s half life at @xmath99 years , qgd can take imaginary couplings without affecting unitarity .",
    "this contrasts with other theories where the coupling constants are much larger than @xmath28 leading to a loss of unitarity if not of gauge invariance as well since @xmath100 .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the absence of diagrams contributing to @xmath69 to the self energies constructed with vertex ( a ) and vertices involving the electromagnetic field .",

    "in this section we calculate 4 scattering amplitudes : the tree - level photon exchange between two particles with equal mass , the tree - level connecton exchange and the 1-loop connecton exchange between two particles with equal mass and the tree - level connecton exchange between a photon and a particle with mass .",
    "these scattering amplitudes yield a total of 4 differential cross sections ; we equate the first 3 to the differential cross section for a schroedinger equation with 3 different potentials : the coulomb potential , the newton potential and the post - newtonian potential while the last cross section matches the cross section for gravitational lensing of a photon by a massive point particle .",
    "the lagrangian provides 4 coupling constants : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "therefore by the end of this section , the 4 coupling constants appearing in the differential cross sections calculated from qgd match those of the schroedinger equation as well as that obtained from gravitational lensing in general relativity .",

    "the matching of the above 4 differential cross sections with those of general relativity coupled to matter and light are more than simple tests . by matching the differential cross sections we have , at least for two particle interactions , shown that the equations of motion for matter and light coupled to general relativity exactly match those for qgd to @xmath2 .",
    "this is manifested by the fact that the schroedinger equation for both theories are the same .",

    "we n=2 supersymmetrize at least one of qgd s su(2 ) gauge groups and consider for example a k3 spacetime manifold .",
    "each su(2 ) yang mills theory then has bps states which have the same moduli space as that of a supersymmetric sigma model which in turn can be used to calculate the degeneracy of bps states for large energy states@xcite .",
    "the degeneracy thus obtained determines the entropy which coincides with that of certain black hole solutions in string theory @xcite .",
    "thus qgd has states whose entropy is that of certain black hole solutions , and therefore , those states represent the quantum description of the black hole solutions in the exact same way they do in string theory .    the solution for @xmath340 yang - mills found in@xcite differs from the schwarzschild black hole solution because the singularity of its horizon can not be removed through a coordinate transformation .",
    "however , both singularities can be located at @xmath341 . therefore in su(2 ) yang mills , the horizon area and the black hole mass are related in the same way as for the schwarzschild black hole : @xmath342 .",
    "this result implies that the su(2 ) yang mills black hole has the same entropy as the schwarzschild black hole which in turn can be expressed in terms of bps solutions .",
    "therefore one has a dual representation of the same physical objects in the @xmath13 supersymmetric limit : the macroscopic system is described by black hole solution found in@xcite , while the microscopic system is described by bps states .",
    "qgd , as presented here , reproduces the expected newtonian and post newtonian interaction evidenced by experimental measurements for both matter fields and photon fields .",
    "in addition to matching the differential cross sections from qgd to those of the schroedinger equation with newtonian and post newtonian corrections as well as the differential cross section for the deflection of light by a point mass particle in general relativity , qgd couples to the standard model in a straight forward and natural manner . thus",
    ", qgd does not require us to re - invent the standard model to have a unified theory .",
    "this contrasts other attempts at describing quantum gravity which require a recasting of the already successful standard model .    the fundamental theory , a straight forward @xmath1 yang - mills , couples to matter in the same manner as su(3 ) and su(2 ) theories describe the other fundamental forces and thus bears a high degree of symmetry with the non - gravitational forces found in nature .",
    "dimensional analysis of qgd and qgd coupled to the standard model show that all terms in the lagrangians have dimensionality four or less and therefore renormalization follows@xcite .",
    "qgd accommodates the full particle spectrum currently known and yields in the low energy limit the expected relativistic forces provided a sufficiently large number of @xmath1 symmetries exists .",
    "the absence in qgd or qgd coupled to the standard model of the graviton should not concern the reader ; after all , we have yet to detect such a particle .",
    "the theory here proposed not only reproduces the observed experimental results of general relativity , exhibits renormalization and couples in a straight forward manner to the standard model , it also incorporates yet to be observed , but highly expected , gravitational interactions between matter and the su(3 ) , su(2 ) and higgs bosons as well as those between these bosons .",
    "these features make qgd coupled to the standard model with @xmath3 local symmetry the most attractive theory to describes all interactions in nature .",
    "i am most grateful to j. lee for providing _ ricci.m _ which was indispensable for all calculations . also indispensable was the encouragement and funding by w. israel during the early attempts to construct this model as well as funding by e. braun in its latter stages .",
