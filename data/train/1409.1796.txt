    "one of the leading aims of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to discover new physics beyond the standard model . in this respect",
    ", extra dimensional models in particle physics have been drawing attention for the past fifteen years .",
    "these models offer a solution to the hierarchy problem , and provide possible candidates for dark matter .",
    "phenomenology of extra dimensional models at the lhc has been widely studied in the literature as a possible new physics candidate .",
    "these phenomenological studies generally involve usual proton - proton deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes where both of the colliding protons dissociate into partons .",
    "subprocesses of quark - quark , gluon - gluon , and quark - gluon scattering have been probed in detail . on the other hand , exclusive",
    "production and semi - elastic processes have been much less studied in the literature . in an exclusive production process",
    "both of the incoming protons remains intact .",
    "they do not dissociate into partons .",
    "however in a semi - elastic scattering process , one of the incoming proton dissociate into partons but the other proton remains intact @xcite .",
    "the exclusive and semi - elastic proton processes are characterized by the interchange of photons or pomerons .",
    "the former generally give larger cross sections since the survival probability for processes involving a photon interchange is larger than that for a pomeron interchange .",
    "the exclusive and semi - elastic photon - mediated processes are sometimes called two - photon and photoproduction processes respectively .",
    "phenomenology of extra dimensions has not been studied comprehensively in these types of processes .",
    "extra dimensional models have been examined via the following two - photon processes : @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite . as far as we know , except for our recent paper @xcite phenomenology of extra dimensional models has not been studied and model parameters have not been constrained in any photoproduction process at the lhc . in our recent paper",
    "we have analyzed the virtual effects of kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons in @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we will investigate real kk graviton emission through the photoproduction process @xmath10",
    "( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath10 consists of the following subprocesses : @xmath11 therefore , in order to obtain the cross section for the main process @xmath10 we have to consider all contributions coming from subprocesses in ( [ subprocesses ] ) .    in a photoproduction process",
    "emitted photons from the proton ought to carry a small amount of virtuality .",
    "( otherwise , proton dissociates after the emission . )",
    "thus , the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) can be successfully applied to a photoproduction process . in epa",
    "we employ the formalism of @xcite , and take account of the electromagnetic form factors of the proton .",
    "hence , epa formula that we have used is different from the pointlike electron or positron case .",
    "exclusive two - photon and photoproduction processes can be distinguished from fully inelastic processes by the virtue of the following experimental signatures : after the elastic emission of a photon , proton is scattered with a small angle and escapes detection from the central detectors .",
    "this causes a missing energy signature called _ forward large - rapidity gap _ , in the corresponding forward region of the central detector @xcite .",
    "this technique was successfully used at the fermilab tevatron by the cdf collaboration .",
    "exclusive production of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 were observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "cms collaboration has also observed exclusive production of @xmath12 and @xmath16 pairs using early lhc data at @xmath17=7 tev @xcite .",
    "another experimental signature can be implemented by forward proton tagging .",
    "there are some proposals that aim to equip atlas and cms central detectors with very forward detectors ( vfd ) which can detect intact scattered protons with a large pseudorapidity .",
    "forward proton tagging in vfd supports forward large - rapidity gap signatures obtained from the central detectors .",
    "operation of vfd in conjunction with central detectors with a precise timing , can efficiently reduce backgrounds from pile - up events @xcite .",
    "it is argued that pile - up background grows rapidly with luminosity and becomes important for high luminosity runs at the lhc .",
    "apart from extra dimensions other new physics scenarios have also been studied via two - photon and photoproduction processes at the lhc .",
    "phenomenological studies involve new physics scenarios such as supersymmetry , unparticles , technicolor , magnetic monopoles and model independent analysis of anomalous interactions @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will focus on two different extra dimensional models , namely , arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) model of large extra dimensions @xcite and randall and sundrum ( rs ) model of warped extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the add model assumes a @xmath18-dimensional spacetime where @xmath19 represents the number of extra spatial dimensions .",
    "extra dimensions are flat and compactified in a volume @xmath20 . for instance",
    ", we can consider a toroidal compactification of volume @xmath21 .",
    "here , @xmath22 represents the radii of extra dimensions . in the add model",
    ", extra dimensions can be as large as approximately 0.1 mm .",
    "for this reason add model is sometimes called the large extra dimensional model . in principle , the number of extra dimensions can be @xmath23 .",
    "but astronomical observations on newton s gravitation law rule out @xmath24 case .",
    "there are also constraints from table top experiments and astrophysical observations .",
    "these constraints are stringent for @xmath25 .",
    "hence , we will consider the case in which @xmath26 .",
    "the add model solves the hierarchy problem by introducing a new mass scale @xmath27 called the fundamental scale which is at the order of electroweak scale .",
    "@xmath27 is the mass scale of the @xmath18-dimensional theory .",
    "thus , it is argued by the model that the true mass scale of the theory is @xmath27 , not the planck scale @xmath28 . on the other hand , an observer confined in a 4-dimensional spacetime measures its value as @xmath28 .",
    "the original version of the rs model assumes the existence of only one extra spatial dimension and two 3-branes ( 4-dimensional spacetimes ) located at boundaries of the extra dimensional coordinate @xmath29 .",
    "the metric is given by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents a constant of the order of the planck scale .",
    "the metric ( [ rsmetric ] ) describes a 5-dimensional anti - de sitter space with a cosmological constant @xmath32 .",
    "extra dimensional coordinate @xmath29 can be parametrized by an angular coordinate @xmath33 via @xmath34 . here",
    ", @xmath35 represents the compactification radius of the extra dimension .",
    "the angular coordinate varies in the range @xmath36 .",
    "it is assumed that we are living in the 3-brane located at the boundary point @xmath37 .",
    "it is deduced from the model that any mass scale @xmath38 observed in @xmath37 brane is generated from the fundamental mass scale @xmath39 which is at the order of @xmath28 .",
    "the relation between these two scales is given by : @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the hierarchy problem is eliminated .",
    "both the add and rs model of extra dimensions involve massive gravitons and gravitational scalars which are possible dark matter candidates . on the other hand ,",
    "mass scales for these new particles are very different in the add and rs models .",
    "this leads to different phenomenologies . in the add model of extra dimensions , mass difference between consecutive graviton excited states",
    "is given approximately by the formula @xcite : @xmath41 we see from this formula that mass splitting is quite narrow .",
    "for instance , if we choose @xmath42 tev and @xmath43 then @xmath44 kev .",
    "therefore , at collider energies kk graviton production processes involve a summation over huge number of graviton final states .",
    "this summation can be approximated to an integral and the cross section for the inclusive production process can be written as @xcite @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the cross section for producing a single kk graviton state of mass @xmath38 .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath47 can be obtained in conventional way from the scattering amplitude .",
    "since the masses of kk states are integrated , total cross section in eq .",
    "( [ addtotalcross ] ) depends on two model parameters @xmath27 and @xmath19 .    in the rs model case ,",
    "the spectrum of kk graviton masses is given by @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the roots of the bessel function @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "we can deduce from this formula that mass splitting between consecutive kk graviton states is considerably large , @xmath52 .",
    "hence it is assumed that only the first kk graviton state can be observed .",
    "we will represent the mass of this first kk graviton state by @xmath53 .",
    "masses of other kk states are proportional to @xmath53 : @xmath54 . in the rs model",
    "we have two independent model parameters .",
    "we prefer to choose @xmath53 and @xmath55 as independent parameters .    the process @xmath1 is represented by the feynman diagrams in fig.[fig2 ]",
    ". we do not give the feynman rules for kk gravitons .",
    "one can find the feynman rules in refs .",
    "analytical expressions for the scattering amplitude are given in the appendix .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction we consider all possible initial quark flavors .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the total cross section for the process @xmath10 we integrate the subprocess cross sections over the photon and quark distributions and sum all contributions from different subprocesses : @xmath56 here , @xmath57 represents the energy ratio between the equivalent photon and incoming proton and @xmath58 is the fraction of the proton s momentum carried by the struck quark . @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the equivalent photon and quark distribution functions . the analytical expression for @xmath59 can be found in the literature , for example in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "@xmath60 can be evaluated numerically . in this paper",
    "we have used parton distribution functions of martin _ et al .",
    "during numerical calculations we assume the existence of vfd proposed by refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was proposed to locate vfd at 220 m and 420 m distances away from the atlas interaction point .",
    "these detectors can detect forward protons within the acceptance region @xmath61 . here",
    ", @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents the initial proton s momentum and @xmath64 represents forward proton s momentum after scattering . according to another scenario vfd",
    "can detect forward protons within @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this scenario is based on vfd located at 420 m distance from the cms interaction point and totem detectors at 147 m and 220 m.    for all numerical results presented in this paper , the center - of - mass energy of the proton - proton system is taken to be @xmath66 tev and the virtuality of the dis is taken to be @xmath67 . here , @xmath68 is the mass of the z boson and it represents only a scale which is roughly at the order of standard model energies .",
    "this virtuality value is reasonable since the average value for the square of the momentum transferred to the proton is approximately at that order .",
    "moreover , at high energies parton distribution functions do not depend significantly on virtuality .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to use a fix virtuality value for the dis .    in fig.[fig3 ] and fig.[fig4 ] we present add model cross section of the process @xmath10 as a function of the fundamental scale @xmath27 for vfd acceptances of @xmath65 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "we consider the cases in which the number of extra spatial dimensions are @xmath69 .",
    "we see from these figures that cross section decreases with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , cross sections for different number of extra dimensions significantly deviate from each other for large @xmath27 values .",
    "these behaviors are obvious from differential cross section formula in eq .",
    "( [ adddiffcross ] ) .",
    "as we have discussed in the previous section , add graviton final states consist of huge number of kk states arranged densely with increasing mass .",
    "this sequence of states is sometimes called a kk tower .",
    "a kk tower is not detected directly in the detectors . instead , its presence is inferred from missing energy signal .",
    "missing signal for a kk tower exhibits a peculiarity which is very different compared with any other new physics processes @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity originates from continuous mass distribution of graviton states in a kk tower .",
    "different from other new physics or standard model processes , we do not have a fix final state mass .",
    "but the cross section is integrated over the mass of final state gravitons ( see eq .",
    "( [ addtotalcross ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the momentum carried by a kk tower can take values which are kinematically forbidden in the fix mass case .",
    "this peculiar behavior is reflected in missing transverse momentum and invariant mass distributions and useful when we want to discern graviton production from other new physics processes and standard model backgrounds . in fig.[fig5]-fig.[fig8 ] we present missing @xmath70 ( @xmath70 of the kk tower ) dependence of the cross section of the process @xmath10 for various number of extra dimensions @xmath19 . in these figures",
    "vfd acceptance is taken to be @xmath65 and @xmath27=5 tev .",
    "@xmath70 distributions for @xmath61 case exhibit similar behaviors .",
    "the main background to our process is @xmath71 .",
    "this background process consists of the following subprocesses : @xmath72 where @xmath73 quark and @xmath74 .",
    "since the final state neutrinos are not detected in the detectors they may generate a missing signal similar to the one coming from graviton production .",
    "but as we have discussed before , the missing signal associated with final state neutrino pair exhibits a different behavior and can be discerned from the missing signal associated with a kk tower . in fig.[fig9 ] and fig.[fig10 ] we plot missing transverse momentum and missing invariant mass dependence of the cross section both for our process and the standard model background . in these figures cross sections",
    "have been calculated by considering all contributions from possible subprocesses . as can be seen from fig.[fig9 ] and fig.[fig10 ] signal and background cross sections are well separated from each other .",
    "we observe from fig.[fig9 ] that differential cross section for the background rapidly decreases as @xmath70 increases and it is suppressed for @xmath75 gev .",
    "graviton production cross section also decreases with increasing @xmath70 .",
    "however , the decrease is approximately linear up to @xmath76 gev ( not shown in the figure )",
    ". the missing invariant mass @xmath77 dependence of the cross section exhibit similar behaviors .",
    "we see from fig.[fig10 ] that background cross section rapidly decreases after the peak point around @xmath78 and it is suppressed for @xmath79 gev .",
    "on the other hand , graviton production cross section does not change considerably for @xmath80 ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "hence , the background can be discerned from the add signal and can be eliminated by imposing a cut on the missing invariant mass or missing transverse momentum .    in the rs model",
    ", we aim to observe first kk graviton state with mass @xmath53 .",
    "similar to techniques used to detect a massive particle such as @xmath81 boson or top quark , an rs graviton can be detected from its decay products .",
    "angular distribution of the rs graviton for the process @xmath10 is given in fig.[fig11 ] .",
    "we consider vfd acceptance of @xmath65 but we expect a similar behavior for @xmath61 case . in the figure , we show both the the cross section including the sum of all contributions from subprocesses in ( [ subprocesses ] ) and cross sections including individual contributions from each subprocess .",
    "we have obtained 95% confidence level ( cl ) bounds on the model parameters of the add and rs models . since the standard model contribution to",
    "the process is absent and the backgrounds can be eliminated it is appropriate to employ a statistical analysis using a poisson distribution . in the add model case , the expected number of events is calculated from the formula : @xmath82 . in this formula , @xmath83 represents the survival probability factor , @xmath84 represents the jet reconstruction efficiency and @xmath85 represents the integrated luminosity .",
    "we take into account a survival probability factor of @xmath86 and jet reconstruction efficiency of @xmath87 .",
    "we also place a pseudorapidity cut of @xmath88 for final quarks and antiquarks from subprocesses in ( [ subprocesses ] ) . in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] we present 95% cl bounds on the fundamental scale for various values of @xmath85 and @xmath19 without imposing a cut on the missing invariant mass or missing transverse momentum . in tables",
    "[ tab3 ] and [ tab4 ] we present similar bounds but in this case we impose a missing invariant mass cut of @xmath79 gev .",
    "as we have discussed , this cut effectively eliminates the background contribution .",
    "we observe from tables [ tab1 ] - [ tab4 ] that the effect of the cut on the sensitivity bounds is minor . the bounds on @xmath27 are slightly spoiled .",
    "for instance , when we compare the bounds in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab3 ] we see that the percentage differences between bounds with and without a cut do not exceed @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 and 6 respectively . in the rs model",
    ", bounds are calculated in the plane of @xmath55 versus @xmath53 . since",
    "an rs graviton can be detected from its decay products , the expected number of events is given by @xmath94 , where @xmath95 represents the branching ratio for the graviton .",
    "we place a pseudorapidity cut of @xmath88 for final quarks , antiquarks and also the graviton .",
    "the limits have been calculated by considering @xmath96 decay channels of the rs graviton with a total branching ratio of @xmath97 @xcite . in fig.[fig12 ] we present the excluded regions in the @xmath55 versus @xmath53 parameter plane for the above branching ratio value .",
    "the standard model processes @xmath98 give rise to the same final states .",
    "determination of an on - shell graviton with mass @xmath99 requires an invariant mass measurement of the final state charged lepton and photon pairs .",
    "therefore , we should impose a cut of @xmath100 on the invariant mass of final leptons and photons .",
    "this cut reduces the effect of background processes drastically . to be precise , the sum of all standard model contributions , i.e. , sum of the cross sections for the processes @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath2 quark , provides a huge cross section of @xmath103 pb .",
    "but if we demand that the invariant mass of final state lepton and photon pairs are in the interval @xmath104 , then the total standard model contribution becomes only @xmath105 pb . thus , the background contribution is reduced by approximately a factor of @xmath106 .",
    "the number of standard model events is smaller than 1 and therefore the background contributions can be ignored .",
    "processes involving real graviton final states provide a direct signal for tev - scale gravity . in the add model of extra dimensions ,",
    "kk gravitons behave like non - interacting stable particles and their presence are inferred from missing energy signal @xcite . but as we have discussed in the previous section , missing signal associated with add gravitons exhibits a peculiar behavior which is very different compared with any other new physics models and standard model backgrounds .",
    "this peculiar behavior allows us to isolate signals coming from graviton production . in the rs model of extra dimensions , kk gravitons",
    "can be detected via their decay products .",
    "the angular distribution of its decay products can be used to determine the spin of the graviton @xcite . in case a particle having a spin of 2 and a mass of @xmath99",
    "is detected , this will be a distinctive signature for the model .",
    "many new physics scenarios can be eliminated by means of this signature .",
    "as we have shown , invariant mass cut on the decay products of the graviton effectively eliminates the background contributions .",
    "therefore , graviton production processes provide important clues for the models of tev - scale gravity .",
    "these type of processes give us the opportunity to isolate and discern the model which is much more difficult for processes in which virtual effects of kk gravitons are considered .",
    "virtual effects of kk gravitons were examined in the following two - photon and photoproduction processes at the lhc : @xmath107 @xcite , @xmath108 @xcite , @xmath109 @xcite and @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "a comparison of our limits with the limits obtained in these processes is difficult in the case of the add model .",
    "it is because in these papers authors used the cutoff procedure of giudice _",
    "@xcite in the graviton propagator that the cross section depends only on the cutoff scale .",
    "it is independent of the number of extra dimensions @xmath19 . on the other hand , if we assume that the convention of giudice _ et al .",
    "_ corresponds to @xmath43 case .",
    "conventions of han _",
    "et al . _ and giudice _ et al . _",
    "coincide for @xmath43 .",
    "] then our present limits on the fundamental scale are better than the limits obtained in two - photon processes @xcite but approximately at the same order with the limits of our recent paper @xcite .",
    "when we compare our rs limits with the limits from processes mentioned above we see that our limits in the plane of @xmath55 versus @xmath53 are stronger than the limits obtained in @xcite but approximately at the same order with the limits of @xcite . to be precise ,",
    "our limits for atlas vfd scenario are little better but our limits for cms - totem vfd scenario are little worse than the corresponding limits obtained in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite only cms - totem vfd scenario was considered for the rs model case .",
    "thus , a comparison for atlas vfd scenario is impossible .",
    "real graviton and radion final states were investigated in the following two - photon processes : @xmath111 @xcite and @xmath112 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite authors considered only the rs model case and it seems they did not obtain the limits on rs model parameters . in ref .",
