    "n. alon @xcite used the term _ `` polynomial method '' _ to refer to the use of non - linear polynomials for solving combinatorial problems .",
    "although the polynomial method is not yet as widely used by combinatorists as , for instance , polyhedral or probabilistic techniques , the literature in this subject continues to grow .",
    "prior work on encoding combinatorial properties included colorings @xcite , stable sets @xcite , matchings @xcite , and flows @xcite .",
    "non - linear encodings of combinatorial problems are often compact .",
    "this contrasts with the exponential sizes of systems of linear inequalities that describe the convex hull of incidence vectors of many combinatorial structures ( see @xcite ) . in this article",
    "we present new encodings for other combinatorial problems , and we discuss applications of polynomial encodings to combinatorial optimization and to computational complexity .",
    "recent work demonstrates that one can derive good semidefinite programming relaxations for combinatorial optimization problems from the encodings of these problems as polynomial systems ( see @xcite and references therein for details ) .",
    "lasserre @xcite , laurent @xcite and parrilo @xcite studied the problem of minimizing a general polynomial function @xmath3 over an algebraic variety having only finitely many solutions .",
    "laurent proved that when the variety consists of the solutions of a zero - dimensional radical ideal @xmath4  , there is a way to set up the optimization problem @xmath5 as a finite sequence of semidefinite programs terminating with the optimal solution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this immediately suggests an application of the polynomial method to combinatorial optimization problems : encode your problem with polynomials equations in @xmath6 $ ] that generate a zero - dimensional ( variety is finite ) radical ideal , then generate the finite sequence of sdps following the method in @xcite .",
    "this highlights the importance of finding systems of polynomials for various combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "the first half of this paper proposes new polynomial system encodings for the problems , with respect to an input graph , of finding a longest cycle , a largest planar subgraph , a largest @xmath0-colorable subgraph , or a minimum edge coloring .",
    "in particular , we establish the following result .",

    "it is natural to ask how big are such sdps . for simplicity of analysis , we look at the case of feasibility instead of optimization . in this case , the sdps are replaced by a large - scale linear algebra problem .",
    "we will discuss details in section [ preliminariesnull ] .",
    "for a hard optimization problem , say max - cut , we associate a system of polynomial equations @xmath45 such that the system has a solution if and only if the problem has a feasible solution . on the other hand ,",
    "the famous hilbert nullstellensatz ( see @xcite ) states that a system of polynomial equations @xmath46 with complex coefficients has no solution in @xmath47 if and only if there exist polynomials @xmath48 $ ] such that @xmath49  .",
    "thus , if the polynomial system @xmath45 has no solution , there exists a _",
    "certificate _ that the combinatorial optimization problem is infeasible .",
    "there are well - known _",
    "upper bounds _ for the degrees of the coefficients @xmath50 in the hilbert nullstellensatz certificate for _ general _ systems of polynomials , and they turn out to be sharp ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , the following well - known example shows that the degree of @xmath51 is at least @xmath52  : @xmath53 but polynomial systems for combinatorial optimization are special .",
    "one question is how complicated are the degrees of nullstellensatz certificates of infeasibility ? as we will see in section [ preliminariesnull ] , unless @xmath1  , for every hard combinatorial problem , there must exist an infinite sequence of infeasible instances for which the minimum degree of a nullstellensatz certificate , for the associated system of polynomials , grows arbitrarily large .",
    "this was first observed by l. lovsz who proposed the problem of finding explicit graphs in @xcite . a main contribution of this article is to exhibit such growth of degree explicitly .",
    "in the second part of the paper we discuss the growth of degree for the np - complete problems stable set and 3-colorability .",
    "we establish the following theorem :    [ deghn ]    1 .   given a graph @xmath2  , let @xmath54 denote its stability number .",
    "a minimum - degree nullstellensatz certificate for the non - existence of a stable set of size greater than @xmath54 has degree equal to @xmath54 and contains at least one term per stable set in @xmath2  .",
    "2 .   every nullstellensatz certificate for non-3-colorability of a graph has degree at least four .",
    "moreover , in the case of a graph containing an odd - wheel or a clique as a subgraph , a minimum - degree nullstellensatz certificate for non-3-colorability has degree exactly four .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "our encoding results for longest cycle and largest planar subgraph appear in subsection [ newencodings1 ] . as a direct consequence ,",
    "we recover a polynomial system characterization of the hamiltonian cycle problem .",
    "similarly , we discuss how to express , in terms of polynomials , the decision question of whether a poset has dimension @xmath55  .",
    "the encodings for edge - chromatic number and largest @xmath0-colorable subgraph also appear in subsection [ newencodings1 ] .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , colorability problems were among the first studied using the polynomial method ; we revisit those earlier results and end subsection [ newencodings2 ] by proposing a notion of _ dual coloring _ derived from our algebraic set up . in section [ preliminariesnull ] we discuss how the growth of degree in the nullstellensatz occurs under the assumption @xmath56  .",
    "we also sketch a linear algebra procedure we used to compute minimum - degree nullstellensatz certificates for particular graphs . in subsection [ hilbertnstable ] we demonstrate the degree growth of nullstellensatz certificates for the stable set problem .",
    "in contrast , in subsection [ hilbertncolor ] , we exhibit many non-3-colorable graphs where there is no growth of degree .",
    "in this section , we focus on how to find new polynomial encodings of some combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "we begin by recalling two nice results in the polynomial method that will be used later on .",
    "d. bayer established a characterization of 3-colorability via a system of polynomial equations @xcite .",
    "we generalize bayer s result as follows :    [ bayerlem ] the graph @xmath2 is @xmath0-colorable if and only if the following zero - dimensional system of equations @xmath57 has a solution .",
    "moreover , the number of solutions equals the number of distinct @xmath0-colorings multiplied by @xmath58  .[graph_coloring_encoding ]    recall that a _ stable set _ or _ independent set _ in a graph @xmath2 is a subset of vertices such that no two vertices in the subset are adjacent . the maximum size @xmath59 of a stable set is called the _ stability number _ of @xmath2  .",
    "we view the stable sets in terms of their _ incidence vectors_. these are 0/1 vectors of length @xmath60  , one for every stable set , where a one in the @xmath14-th entry indicates that the @xmath14-th vertex is a member of the associated stable set .",
    "these @xmath61 vectors can be fully described by a small system of _ quadratic _ equations :    the graph @xmath2 has stability number at least @xmath0 if and only if the following zero - dimensional system of equations @xmath62 has a solution . [ stable_set_encoding ]",
    "next we establish similar encodings for the combinatorial problems stated in theorem [ encodingthm ] .",
    "suppose that a cycle @xmath63 of length @xmath8 exists in the graph @xmath2  .",
    "we set @xmath64 or @xmath65 depending on whether node @xmath14 is on @xmath63 or not .",
    "next , starting the numbering at any node of @xmath63  , we set @xmath66 if node @xmath14 is the @xmath67-th node of @xmath63  .",
    "it is easy to check that eqs .",
    "[ sizecycle ] and [ choosevertex ] are satisfied .    to verify eq .",
    "[ cyclicity ] , note that since @xmath63 has length @xmath8  , if vertex @xmath14 is the @xmath67-th node of the cycle , then one of its neighbors , say @xmath0  , must be the `` follower '' , namely the @xmath68-th element of the cycle .",
    "if @xmath69  , then the factor @xmath70 appears in the product equation associated with the @xmath14-th vertex , and the product is zero . if @xmath71  , then the factor @xmath72 appears , and the product is again 0 . since this is true for all vertices that are turned  on \" , and for all vertices that are  off \" , we have eq . [ cyclicity ] automatically equal to zero , all of the equations of the polynomials vanish .",
    "conversely , from a solution of the system above , we see that @xmath8 variables @xmath73 are not zero ; call this set @xmath63  .",
    "we claim that the nodes @xmath74 must form a cycle . since @xmath75  , the polynomial of eq .",
    "[ cyclicity ] must vanish ; thus for some @xmath76  , @xmath77 note that eq .",
    "[ cyclicity ] reduces to this form when @xmath78  . therefore ,",
    "either vertex @xmath14 is adjacent to a vertex @xmath67 ( with @xmath79 ) such that @xmath80 equals the _ next integer value _",
    "( @xmath81 ) , or @xmath82 ( again , with @xmath79 ) . in the second case , since @xmath83 and @xmath80 are integers between 1 and @xmath8  , this forces @xmath84 and @xmath85  . by the pigeonhole principle",
    ", this implies that all integer values from 1 to @xmath8 must be assigned to some node in @xmath63 starting at vertex 1 and ending at @xmath8 ( which is adjacent to the node receiving @xmath86 ) .",
    "we have the following corollary .",
    "a graph @xmath2 has a hamiltonian cycle if and only if the following zero - dimensional system of @xmath87 equations has a solution . for every node @xmath21",
    ", we have two equations : @xmath88 the number of hamiltonian cycles in the graph @xmath2 equals the number of solutions of the system divided by @xmath87  .",
    "clearly when @xmath89 we can just fix all @xmath73 to @xmath86  , thus many of the equations simplify or become obsolete .",
    "we only have to check the last statement on the number of hamiltonian cycles .",
    "for that , we remark that no solution appears with multiplicity because the ideal is radical . that the ideal is radical is implied by the fact that every variable appears as the only variable in a unique square - free polynomial ( see page 246 of @xcite ) .",
    "finally , note for every cycle there are @xmath15 ways to choose the initial node to be labeled as @xmath86  , and then two possible directions to continue the labeling .",
    "note that similar results can be established for the directed graph version , thus one can consider paths or cycles with orientation .",
    "also note that , we can use the polynomials systems above to investigate the distribution of cycle lengths in a graph ( similarly for path lengths and cut sizes ) .",
    "this topic has several outstanding questions .",
    "for example , a still unresolved question of erds and gyrfs @xcite asks : if @xmath2 is a graph with minimum - degree three , is it true that @xmath2 always has a cycle having length that is a power of two ?",
    "define the _ cycle - length polynomial _ as the square - free univariate polynomial whose roots are the possible cycle lengths of a graph ( same can be done for cuts ) . considering @xmath8 as a variable , the reduced lexicographic grbner basis ( with @xmath8 the last variable ) computation provides us with a unique univariate polynomial on @xmath8 that is divisible by the cycle - length polynomial of @xmath2  .",
    "now we proceed to the proof of part 2 of theorem [ encodingthm ] . for this",
    "we recall schnyder s characterization of planarity in terms of the dimension of a poset @xcite : for an @xmath15-element poset @xmath90  , a _ linear extension _ is an order preserving bijection @xmath91  .",
    "the _ poset dimension _ of p is the smallest integer @xmath92 for which there exists a family of @xmath92 linear extensions @xmath93 of @xmath90 such that @xmath94 in p if and only if @xmath95 for all @xmath96  .",

    "a graph @xmath2 is planar if and only if the poset dimension of @xmath97 is no more than three .",
    "thus our first step is to encode the linear extensions and the poset dimension of a poset @xmath90 in terms of polynomial equations .",
    "the idea is similar to our characterization of cycles via permutations .",
    "the poset @xmath101 has poset dimension at most @xmath55 if and only if the following system of equations has a solution :    for @xmath102 @xmath103 for @xmath104  , and every ordered pair of comparable elements @xmath105 in @xmath90  : @xmath106 for every ordered pair of incomparable elements of @xmath90 ( i.e. , @xmath107 and @xmath108 )  : @xmath109 for @xmath104  , and for every pair @xmath110 : @xmath111    with eqs .",

    "conversely from a solution , the subgraph @xmath118 in question is read off from those @xmath122  .",
