    "we define the @xmath0-sat problem on a tree as follows .",
    "consider a regular @xmath11-ary tree @xmath25 in which every vertex has exactly @xmath11 descendents .",
    "the root of the tree @xmath22 has degree @xmath11 and its @xmath11 edges are connected to function nodes @xmath26 .",
    "each function node has degree @xmath0 , and each of its @xmath27 descendents @xmath28 is the root of an independent tree ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sat ] ) .",
    "hence the root has a degree @xmath11 while all the other vertices on the tree ( except the leaves which have a degree @xmath29 ) have a degree @xmath30 .",

    "an assignment @xmath36 of all the variables on the tree is a solution iff @xmath37 for all the clauses on the tree .",
    "one configuration of dashed and solid lines on the tree defines a realization @xmath38 .",
    "we study the probability that a realization has no solution on this tree for a fixed boundary .",
    "a realization with no solution is one for which not a single assignment of the variables provides a solution .",
    "this can happen if there is even a single variable on the graph , which , whether it takes the value @xmath31 or @xmath3 , causes atleast one clause to be unsatisfied .",
    "such a variable then is a variable that can take @xmath24 values by our definition , and a realization that is not solvable has at least one variable of this type .    on the tree graph",
    ", we can define the probabilities of a variable taking @xmath24 , @xmath3 or @xmath19 values on the corresponding subtree .",
    "we define @xmath39 as the conditional probability for a variable @xmath34 to cause a contradiction , in the subtree of which it is the root , given that all the other variables in the subtree can take at least @xmath3 value .",
    "we can then estimate the probability of a realization _ having _ a solution ( or the fraction of realizations that have solutions ) by calculating the quantity @xmath40 where the product is over all the variables in the graph .",
    "the tree structure of the graph , gives us a way of calculating @xmath39 through recursions .",
    "we define below some of the quantities in terms of which these recursions are written .",
    "we define @xmath41 to be the probability that ( or the fraction of realizations in which ) a variable at depth @xmath42 can neither take the value @xmath31 nor take the value @xmath3 , without causing a contradiction in its subtree . here , by depth @xmath42 , we mean a node that is @xmath42 levels away from the leaves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sat ] ) . note that because of the tree structure and because of the definition of the specific quantity we are looking at , all variables @xmath34 at depth @xmath42 will have the same probability @xmath43 . the probability that a variable at depth @xmath42 , can take only one of the two values @xmath31 or @xmath3 is defined to be @xmath44 ( the boundary nodes have @xmath45 , for example ) .",
    "similarly the probability that a variable at depth @xmath42 can take both values is @xmath46 . for the problems we look at",
    ", we are interested in the recursions for these quantities deep within the tree , as in @xcite , so that we can get rid of boundary effects .",
    "we consider a model where each variable has a fixed degree @xmath30 , and a variable appears as negated with probability p. for @xmath16 this corresponds to the uniform random k- sat @xcite .",
    "this model was also studied in @xcite for @xmath2 on random graphs using the replica and cavity methods .",
    "let us first calculate @xmath47 for variable @xmath22 ( assuming it is at depth @xmath48 ) , given these quantities for its descendents .",
    "assume variable @xmath22 has a degree @xmath11 ( by definition ) and assume it is not negated on @xmath49 of these clauses .",
    "variable @xmath22 will not be able to take the value @xmath31 in the case when _ at least _",
    "one of the @xmath49 clauses is _ not _ satisfied by the @xmath27 variables at the other end . in this case",
    "there will be at least one unsatisfied clause if @xmath22 takes the value @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , if at least one of the @xmath50 clauses which are satisfied by @xmath22 , are also not satisfied by the @xmath27 variables at the other end , then @xmath22 can not take the value @xmath3 either .",
    "it is easy to see that averaging over all realizations at depth @xmath48 implies averaging over all values of @xmath49 , as well as averaging over all realizations at depth @xmath42 .",
    "it is important to note however tha realizations at depth @xmath48 are only built up from those realizations at depth @xmath42 that do have solutions .",
    "we define @xmath51 as the conditional probability that a depth @xmath42 variable does not satisfy the clause above ( to depth @xmath48 ) , given that it has to be able to take at atleast one value ( which satisfies the sub tree of which it is the root ) .",
    "the recursion for @xmath47 is then :    @xmath52    now we define @xmath53 as the probability that a variable takes only one value and that value is @xmath31 and @xmath54 as the probability that the variable takes only one value and that value is @xmath3 . hence , the probability that a variable can take only one of the two possible values is @xmath55 .",
    "recursions for these two quantities are as follows : @xmath56    @xmath57    hence , @xmath58 this gives us the recursion    @xmath59    these equations are a generalization of the recursions for @xmath60 obtained in @xcite for @xmath16 . from these equations the threshold at which the fraction of realizations goes to zero exponentially with the depth of the tree may be extracted .",
    "this is the solvability threshold for these models @xcite .",
    "a fixed point analysis of eq . [ qbias ] predicts a continuous transition for @xmath1 and a first order transition for @xmath61 for all @xmath62 ( we see no change in behaviour for any non - zero value of @xmath15 though , as reported in @xcite ) .",

    "the value of @xmath9 corresponding to the fixed point value @xmath66 on the tree should be @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "hence for @xmath19-sat , @xmath68 is equivalent to @xmath69 .",
    "a known earlier result @xcite provides us an opportunity to compare the above value of @xmath70 with the exact value of the solvability threshold for @xmath19-sat .",
    "let @xmath71 represent the degree of @xmath72 variable on a random graph , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 be the degree of the corresponding literals .",
    "hence @xmath75 . for @xmath19-sat",
    "defined on a random graph with a given literal distribution @xmath76 , the location of the threshold can be derived using the following theorem by cooper et al @xcite :    _ * theorem : * _ let @xmath38 be any degree sequence over @xmath5 variables , with @xmath77 , and let @xmath78 be a uniform random simple formula with a given degree sequence @xmath38 , then for @xmath79 and @xmath8 , if @xmath80 then p(f is satisfiable ) @xmath81 and if @xmath82 then p(f is satisfiable ) @xmath83 .",
    "here @xmath4 is the number of clauses .    the theorem can be easily generalised to the case where we take d to be the average value of @xmath84 in the case that the degrees of the variables are distributed according to a given probability distribution .    for biased random @xmath19-sat defined on a regular random graph ,",
    "since the probability distribution of the literals is @xmath85 , we get @xmath86 .",
    "hence we get , @xmath87 .",
    "since @xmath88 we get @xmath89 .",
    "this matches with the threshold obtained via the tree calculations ( see eq .",

    ", we also calculated the threshold for biased random @xmath19-sat on a random graph . in this case the degree of a variable is not fixed but is distributed according to a poisson distribution .",
    "for this we get @xmath90 .",
    "the threshold then is given by the equation :    @xmath91    since @xmath92 , we get @xmath93 . as can be seen from the above result , the sat - unsat transition threshold for poisson distributed degree depends only on the average degree of the graph .",
    "also , from the foregoing calculations , we see that for the same @xmath15 the random @xmath19-sat defined on a regular graph has a higher threshold . for example , for the most well studied case of @xmath16 the threshold value of @xmath9 on random graph is @xmath3 , while on regular random graph it is @xmath94 .    for @xmath61",

    "the recursions we developed in @xcite and in this paper are connected to the well - known problem of tree reconstruction .",
    "the reconstruction problem , as originally defined , is a broadcast model on a tree , such that information is sent from the root to the leaves , across edges which act as noisy channels .",
    "the problem then is whether we can recover information about the root from a knowledge of the configuration of the leaves .",
    "apart from its intrinsic interest , it is also of interest for @xmath0-sat because it has been shown that the recursions developed in the reconstruction context are exactly the same as obtained by other means ( such as the replica or cavity methods ) for the dynamical glass transition on a random graph @xcite or the clustering transition for @xmath0 sat ( the value of @xmath70 beyond which the solution - space is fragmented into different clusters ) .    in terms of reconstruction ,",
    "these fixed point recursions are developed for the unconditional probability distribution at the root of the tree to have a certain bias ; namely , the fraction of boundary conditions ( out of all boundary conditions that have a non - zero solution set ) , weigted by the total number of solutions these boundary conditions possess , that leads to the root taking the value @xmath31 a certain number of times and the value @xmath3 a certain number of times .",
    "the fixed point equations developed in @xcite and in this paper have three differences in comparison with the one developed in @xcite .",
    "we look at a reduced quantity - if the root can take two values ( no matter what the bias ) , we lump it together to call it @xmath98 for a level @xmath42 .",
    "the quantity of interest that we can now derive is a fixed point distribution for a single number , namely @xmath99 .",
    "this makes our recursions similar in spirit to survey propagation ( sp ) as we explain below .",
    "secondly and more importantly , @xmath44 , @xmath98 _ etc _ give the fraction of _ realizations _ , at the root , which have a non - zero solution set and _ not _ the fraction of boundaries .",
    "thirdly , unlike in @xcite , where boundary conditions are weigted by the number of solutions they lead to , we do not weight the realizations by the number of solutions they have .",
    "rather , to get @xmath98 for example , we weight each realization equally in which the root can take both values @xmath3 and @xmath31 .    to see the similarities with earlier approaches better ,",
    "let us now define the probability space over boundary conditions instead of realizations .",
    "we now derive a recursion for the fraction of boundary conditions that fix the value unambiguously at the root ( so that it is either @xmath31 or @xmath3 ) at level @xmath42 , given this quantity for level @xmath100 . only those boundary conditions that lead to solutions at level @xmath100 are permitted .",
    "note , as mentioned earlier , this is different from tree reconstruction in that now each boundary is weighted equally and not by the number of solutions it leads to .",
    "these equations are the same as those derived earlier in @xcite , since the constraints that lead to the recursions are the same ( and are defined once we specify the model ) .",
    "the only difference is that , since we are working with a typical realization , the extra average over all realizations is no longer allowed .",
    "the equations are hence    @xmath101   \\left [ 1-\\left(1- \\left ( \\frac{p_n(1)}{2 ( 1-p_n(0))}\\right)^{k-1}\\right)^{d - d_1}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\",
    "p_{n+1}(1 ) & = & \\left ( 1 - \\left (      \\frac{p_n(1)}{2 ( 1-p_n(0 ) ) } \\right)^{k-1 } \\right)^{d - d_1 } +      \\left ( 1 - \\left (      \\frac{p_n(1)}{2 ( 1-p_n(0 ) ) } \\right)^{k-1 } \\right)^{d_1 } - \\nonumber \\\\     & & 2 \\left(1- \\left(\\frac { p_n(1 ) } { 2 ( 1-p_n(0 ) ) } \\right)^{k-1}\\right)^d      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 is a particular realization of negations at the root .",
    "the factor of @xmath19 in the expression @xmath102 appears because if @xmath44 is the total fraction of bc s that determine the root ( at level @xmath42 ) to be either @xmath31 or @xmath3 , then , because of symmetry , exactly half of these configurations will not satisfy the link to level @xmath48 , no matter what this link is .",
    "the fixed points for different @xmath0 obtained from the above equation are very close to the values obtained earlier in @xcite .",
    "infact , in the above form , we can also relate eq .",
    "[ eq : modrec ] to the form of the recursions derived in reference @xcite in their analysis of the sp algorithm . to see this , note that if we substitute @xmath104 in eqn [ eq : modrec ] , we get the recursion      in the sp language , @xmath105 is the same as the cavity bias survey and @xmath106 is the analog of the probability of receving no supporting ( or impeding ) warning .",
    "[ rec_sp ] is exactly the recursion obtained in @xcite , from the sp equations , when the probability distribution over the cavity bias surveys is replaced by a delta function , hence ignoring the differences in the values of these surveys between different variables @xmath107 or different realizations .    in our case",
    ", we get the recursions quite simply and without any approximations , from the way we have set up the problem in terms of computing the fraction of solvable realizations .",
    "it is remarkable that these two different ways of thinking of the problem , one of which gives an estimate of the solvability transition and the other an estimate of the clustering transition , give the same recursions .    in another interesting analogy , the recursions in eq .",
    "[ eq : regksat ] are also exactly in the spirit of the naive reconstruction algorithm mentioned by semerjian @xcite where a connection is now made with the freezing transition .    in conclusion",
    "our main contribution in this paper is that we have been able to get the exact sat - unsat threshold for a number of models of random @xmath0-sat on a @xmath11-ary tree .",
    "this threshold matches exactly with the threshold on a random graph for @xmath1 and is very close to the numerical estimate of the threshold for @xmath2 .",
    "in addition the numbers we get are equal to the numbers obtained for the dynamical glass transition for higher @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the latter is a result of the fact that our equations though averaged over realizations , might equally well be thought of as an average over boundary conditions , and hence are connected to the analysis of the sp algorithm .",
    "however note that in our way of setting up the fixed point equations , we can directly make a connection with the solvability transition which , to our knowledge , has not been mentioned before in the context of a tree calculation .",
    "usually the solvability transition is estimated via the complexity @xcite , which is defined as the number of constrained clusters in a typical instance of the problem .",
    "the complexity is calculated using the cavity method - it becomes non - zero at @xmath10 and reduces in value as @xmath70 increases till it reaches @xmath24 , which is the point conjectured to be the solvability transition .",
    "the values obtained by these means are very close to numerics for all values of @xmath0 , unlike in our case",
    ". it would be interesting to understand whether any analog of the complexity can be formulated for the tree .",
    "our fixed point equations are for a reduced or coarse - grained probability distribution function , but for this simplified quantity , we are able to write down an equation in closed form",
    ". it would be very interesting to understand whether , in our formalism , the above is also possible for the full distribution , such as the distribution of the fraction of realizations ( or boundary conditions ) that the root takes the value @xmath31 a fraction @xmath108 of the times and the value @xmath3 a fraction @xmath109 of the times .",
    "for either of these cases , weigting realizations by the number of solutions they possess is also an obvious generalization of the results presented here , which would be useful to investigate .",
    "also , as mentioned here , variations of the same recursions seem to have connections to the clustering transition @xcite , the freezing transition @xcite , and the solvability transition @xcite",
    ". it would be useful to quantify this better , as a tree calculation being exact , would make it possibile to obtain precise bounds on these transitions .",
    "our study of the different cases of balancing literals and degrees leads to the conclusion that balancing literals makes the problem harder while balancing the degree actually makes the problem easier .",
    "hence the hardest problem , from the point of view of having the lowest sat - unsat threshold is the case of balanced literals with a poisson degree distribution . in this case , for @xmath1 the solvability threshold is also the percolation threshold for erds - ryni random graphs , consistent with the conjecture that the satisfiability threshold on a graph can not be lower than the percolation threshold on the same graph .",

    "<S> we compute the same quantity ( the fraction of satisfiable instances as a function of @xmath11 ) for some variants of the random @xmath0-sat on a @xmath11-ary rooted tree and compare with the solvability thresholds obtained for the same problem on a regular random graph . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for @xmath1 the threshold obtained via the tree calculations matches the known exact value for a regular random graph . for higher @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the problem numerically on regular random graphs and find that the threshold estimated on the tree is very close to the threshold obtained numerically for @xmath2 , though deviating more and more as @xmath0 increases . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , as before @xcite , the values obtained by our method are also very close to the value predicted for the clustering transition by dynamical @xmath3-rsb calculations on a random graph for these models ( @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the two variants of @xmath0-sat studied in this paper are biased - random @xmath0-sat and balanced @xmath0-sat . in biased random @xmath0-sat each variable is negated with probability @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 this reduces to the uniform random @xmath0-sat ) . in balanced @xmath0-sat , each variable is constrained to occur negated and non - negated an equal number of times . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied a generalisation of balanced @xmath0-sat which we call @xmath17-balanced @xmath0-sat , where a literal occurs @xmath17 times as one kind and @xmath18 as another .    </S>",
    "<S> the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ section1 ] we explain the @xmath11-ary rooted tree on which we define various variants of random @xmath0-sat . in section [ section2 ] and [ section3 ] </S>",
    "<S> we study the biased random @xmath0-sat and balanced @xmath0-sat on the tree and compare the sat - unsat threshold on the tree with the thresholds obtained on random graphs and regular random graphs . in section [ section4 ] </S>",
    "<S> we explain the connection between our approach and the survey - propagation algorithm , which goes towards understanding why the numbers we get as an estimate of the solvability transition , also happen to be very close to the numbers obtained via dynamical 1-rsb calculations for the clustering transition . </S>"
