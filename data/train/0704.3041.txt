    "the family of ferroborates with the general formula @xmath5  ( r is a rare - earth ion or y ) attracts considerable attention since its members exhibit a wide variety of phase transitions .",
    "they possess magnetic structures which change as a function of temperature , external magnetic field and substitutions in the rare - earth subsystem.@xcite it was recently discovered that @xmath5 , ( r = gd , nd ) exhibits multiferroic features , i.e. the coexistence of elastic , magnetic and electric order parameters.@xcite the various ordering phenomena and their interaction cause anomalies in the dielectric permeability , electric polarization and magnetostriction , both spontaneous and field - induced .",
    "our study aims to elucidate this interplay for the ferroborate @xmath0 , in which both the rare - earth ions and the fe - ions form a magnetic subsystem .",
    "the crystal structure of @xmath0  at high temperatures is trigonal and belongs to the space group @xmath6 ( r32).@xcite the main elements of the structure are spiral chains of edge - sharing feo@xmath7 octahedra running along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the rare - earth ions are coordinated by triangular ro@xmath7 prisms which are isolated from each other since they are separated by regular bo@xmath8 triangles and have no common oxygen ions .",
    "both the bo@xmath8 triangles and ro@xmath7 prisms connect three feo@xmath7 chains .",
    "there are no direct fe - o - fe links within the same @xmath1-plane and the shortest interchain exchange paths are therefore given by fe - o - r - o - fe and fe - o - b - o - fe , while the fe - o - fe exchange paths within the chains are much shorter ( see fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] ) . in the case of @xmath9 ,",
    "the room temperature structure was found to be transformed to the @xmath10 ( p3@xmath112@xmath11 ) space group at @xmath12k.@xcite below @xmath13 , two non - equivalent fe sites are present , which give rise to both a stretched and compressed modification of the feo@xmath7 spiral chains .    in @xmath9 ,",
    "the presence of different magnetic sublattices causes several magnetic transitions below @xmath13 , which are associated with antiferromagnetic spin ordering of the fe - sublattice ( @xmath4@xmath14k ) and a spin reorientation at @xmath15@xmath16k.@xcite in addition , strong magnetostrictive and magnetoelectric effects below @xmath15  are associated with a spin reorientation which occurs in external magnetic fields with @xmath17-axis.@xcite    in this paper , we report on the thermodynamic properties of @xmath0 . our data on @xmath0",
    "show a spin - flop phase transition , which is driven by magnetic fields @xmath18 .",
    "this transition is associated with a large jump of the magnetization .",
    "the highly anisotropic magnetic susceptibility is ascribed mainly to the ising - like behavior of the tb@xmath3 ions in the trigonal crystal field .",
    "our experimental data are analyzed in the context of the unified approach which is based on mean - field approximation and crystal - field calculations .",
    "the spin - flop transition is apparently accompanied by magnetoelastic effects .",
    "magnetoelectric effects might therefore be associated with the spin - flop transition , leading @xmath0  to be a candidate for a multiferroic compound .",
    "the single crystals of @xmath0  were grown using a bi@xmath19mo@xmath8o@xmath20-based flux.@xcite the seeds were obtained by spontaneous nucleation from the same flux .",
    "single crystals were green in color and had a good optical quality .",
    "the orientation of the crystals was performed by x - ray diffraction .",
    "all magnetic measurements were performed with the external magnetic field either parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath1-axis of the crystal .",
    "the ac - susceptibility at 1000 hz and dc - susceptibility were measured in magnetic fields of 0.001 t and 0.1 t , respectively , in the temperature range 1.8 - 350k using a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the magnetization @xmath21 was measured between 4.2 and 120k in fields up to 15 t with a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm).@xcite the field sweep rate was approximately 0.2t / min .",
    "in addition to this , a pulsed field magnetometer was used for magnetization measurements up to 50t.@xcite here , the total pulse duration amounted to 0.05s .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat was measured in the temperature range 1.8 - 300k and in magnetic fields up to 9 t with a ppms calorimeter .",
    "@xmath0  exhibits two phase transitions below room temperature , as is illustrated by the specific heat and magnetization data in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . by comparison with @xmath9 , the first order phase transition at @xmath22= 192k is tentatively attributed to a structural symmetry reduction to the low symmetric p3@xmath112@xmath11-phase.@xcite actually , the data exhibit several first order anomalies of the specific heat in the vicinity of @xmath22  which are probably related to structural changes . the origin of these anomalies can not be clarified by our present study which focuses on the magnetic properties of @xmath0 .",
    "the structural phase transition is associated with an entropy jump of @xmath23 1.9j / mol k. at @xmath4  = 40 k , the onset of antiferromagnetic spin order in the iron subsystem is demonstrated by a sharp jump in the specific heat and a kink in the magnetization . we observe a specific heat jump of @xmath24 59.4j / mol k. this result agrees with the jump @xmath25 which is predicted from the mean field theory for the antiferromagnetic spin ordering of the @xmath26 fe - sublattice:@xcite @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the gas constant . the entire spin entropy of the fe@xmath3 subsystem appears to develop only below @xmath4 .",
    "the fe@xmath3 subsystem must therefore be considered as a classical 3d antiferromagnet , since short range spin correlations at significantly higher temperatures which would be present if the fe@xmath3 chains were able to form quasi one - dimensional magnets are clearly absent .",
    "an analysis of the specific heat data @xcite indeed confirms that the magnetic ordering only occurs in the fe subsystem while the tb subsystem is polarized by the fe subsystem .",
    "in contrast to the anomalies due to the structural and magnetic phase transitions at @xmath22  and @xmath4 , respectively , the schottky anomaly in the specific heat at @xmath2920k reveals the temperature - driven population of the ground state of the tb@xmath3 ions split in the magnetic field of the fe subsystem .",
    "no spin reorientation ( similar to the one seen in @xmath9  ferroborate ) was observed at low temperatures in zero magnetic field .",
    "depending on their direction , external magnetic fields can have a drastic effect on the magnetic properties of @xmath0 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for applied magnetic fields parallel to the @xmath30-axis there is a linear field dependence of the magnetization at 4.2k .",
    "the data imply @xmath31=0.14@xmath32/t f.u .",
    "in contrast , applying a magnetic field along the easy magnetic axis , i.e. the trigonal @xmath1-axis , causes a sharp jump in the magnetization at @xmath33(4.2k ) @xmath29 3.5 t . here , the magnetic field drives a first order transition .",
    "we demonstrate further below that the main feature of this transition is a spin - flop of the afm ordered fe@xmath3 spins which is accompanied by the orientation of magnetic moments of the tb@xmath3 subsystem along the external magnetic field .",
    "the strongly discontinuous character of the transition is illustrated also by the pulsed field data in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . in the pulsed field ( @xmath34t / s )",
    "the hysteresis at the spin - flop transition is one order of magnitude larger than in the quasi - static measurement ( @xmath35t / s ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , due to the relaxation processes and magnetocaloric effect . at high magnetic fields",
    "@xmath36 , the data show a linear @xmath21 curve with @xmath37=0.13@xmath32/t f.u . being slightly smaller than @xmath31 .    the magnetization data in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] show a strong anisotropy .",
    "it is reasonable ( and will be shown in sec .",
    "[ comparison ] in a detailed analysis ) to attribute this anisotropy to the highly anisotropic tb@xmath3 magnetic moments , which are subject to the staggered field of the antiferromagnetically ordered fe spins .",
    "the discussion hence must not only address the two subsystems of fe and tb moments , of which the fe system divides in the two sublattices below @xmath4 , but also the tb subsystem must be discussed in terms of two sublattices since it is polarized by the indirect exchange interaction with the iron subsystem .",
    "the field dependences of the magnetization at 4.2k shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , reveals two anisotropy features : ( 1 ) a sharp increase of the magnetic moment @xmath299@xmath38  evolves at the critical field @xmath39 .",
    "( 2 ) the linear contribution to @xmath40 only exists above @xmath39 .",
    "if the extra moment ( 1 ) is neglected , the linear part of @xmath40 is a straight line through the origin which is very similar to @xmath41 .",
    "such behaviour ( 2 ) is typical for an uniaxial antiferromagnet magnetized along the easy axis .    upon heating ( see fig .",
    "[ m_b_t ] ) , the spin - flop transition shifts to higher temperatures and vanishes above @xmath4 , but it remains clearly visible in the entire antiferromagnetically spin ordered phase .",
    "however , the magnetization jump reduces in value and becomes less sharp as it is shifted towards higher fields . for fields larger than @xmath39  as well as for @xmath42@xmath4",
    "the magnetization curves become nonlinear .",
    "below @xmath4  and for fields @xmath43@xmath39 , the staggered field of the fe spins polarizes the terbium subsystem due to @xmath44-@xmath45 interactions yielding two tb sublattices with the magnetic moments oriented oppositely and along the @xmath1-axis . for @xmath18 the effective field acting on the terbium sublattice",
    "which magnetic moment opposes the applied field is decreased as the applied field increases and this magnetic moment tends to diminish .",
    "this is a factor determining the character of the magnetization at 4.2k prior to the phase transition , since at low temperatures the longitudinal susceptibility of the iron subsystem is very small . at @xmath39 the staggered field acting on the tb@xmath3 magnetic moments vanishes as the magnetic moments of fe@xmath3 ions become oriented nearly perpendicular to them . as a result ,",
    "the magnetic moments of tb@xmath3 ions align with the external magnetic field reaching the saturation value of about 9 @xmath32 at low temperatures .    in the spin - flop phase",
    "both terbium sublattices have magnetic moments directed along the field @xmath18 and the magnetic moments of iron sublattices bend towards the field direction .",
    "this part of the magnetization curve allows us to estimate the transverse susceptibility of the iron subsystem : @xmath46 = 0.13 @xmath32/t f.u .",
    "the observation of @xmath47 suggests a small contribution from the tb subsystem for @xmath48 . at higher temperatures , as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the magnetization curves gradually become less sharp . in the initial collinear phase",
    "the iron subsystem begins to contribute to the magnetization as longitudinal susceptibility grows with increasing temperature , thus stabilizing the initial phase .",
    "the magnetic phase diagram , constructed from this data and from specific heat measurements in magnetic fields , is presented in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "the difference in phase boundaries shown by open and full symbols accounts for the hysteretic phenomena and finite slope of m(b ) curves at the spin - flop transition .",
    "this diagram shows that magnetic fields parallel to the @xmath1-axis slightly suppress the antiferromagnetic spin ordering temperature of the fe sublattice .",
    "in contrast , the critical field of the spin - flop transition increases upon heating .",
    "the magnetic properties of terbium ferroborate are governed by both magnetic subsystems interacting with each other . as already mentioned above",
    ", the crystal structure of rare - earth ferroborates@xcite suggests that the main feature of their magnetic structure is formed by the helical iron chains along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "however , our experimental data provide no evidence for quasi-1d magnetic properties , which indicates significant interactions between the chains . moreover , the experimental magnetization curves and phase diagram have the form which is typical for 3d uniaxial antiferromagnets .",
    "this fact provides reason enough to consider the magnetic structure of the fe subsystem as that of iniaxial aitiferromagnet with two sublattices magnetic moments of which are equal in the absence of field .",
    "the interactions hierarchy in the system is such that it stabilizes the orientations of fe and tb magnetic moments along the trigonal axis .",
    "indeed , the strongest interaction in the compound is the crystal field ( the splitting of the ground multiplet comprises about 400 - 500 @xmath49 , the energy interval between the ground quasi - doublet and the nearest excited states is of the order of 200 @xmath49 ) , and the non - kramers tb@xmath3 ion in the trigonal crystal field acquires a huge anisotropy ( @xmath50@xmath29 18 , @xmath51 @xmath29 0 ) and becomes an ising ion with the preferred orientation of magnetic moment along the trigonal axis .",
    "interaction comparable in value with the crystal field is absent in the system , therefore there is no source of any other orientation of tb magnetic moments .",
    "and so there are grounds to suggest a collinear arrangement of magnetic moments in @xmath0  .",
    "we note however that only neutron diffraction studies on an 11b - enriched compound can unambiguously resolve the magnetic structure under discussion .    in the following section we model the magnetic properties of @xmath0  using molecular field theory . within this approximation the total hamiltonian , which comprises the hamiltonians of the iron and the terbium subsystems as well as the one considering the tb - fe interaction ,",
    "can be expressed as a sum of single - particle hamiltonians . in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath52",

    "the crystal - field hamiltonian @xmath61 is governed by the symmetry of the local environment of the rare - earth ion .    as explained in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] , from the analogy to the structural phase transition at 156  k in @xmath9  we suppose that the specific heat anomaly at @xmath22  = 192k reflects a crystal symmetry reduction from the trigonal space group r32 to the trigonal group p3@xmath112@xmath11 .",
    "this implies that the local symmetry of the tb@xmath3 ion is reduced from @xmath62 at @xmath63 to @xmath64 at @xmath65 @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless ( as will be discussed below ) a simpler hamiltonian of @xmath62 symmetry is sufficient for describing the low - temperature magnetic properties of @xmath0 , since the available crystal - field parameters of isostructural compounds give rise to two closely - spaced ( with a splitting less than 2 - 3 @xmath49 ) singlets as a low - lying state of the ground multiplet .",
    "these singlets are responsible for the ising - like behavior of this non - kramers ion in both the paramagnetic and the ordered phases .    in order to describe the thermodynamic properties of rare - earth compounds we only need to consider the ground multiplet . in terms of the equivalent operators @xmath66",
    "the crystal field hamiltonian @xmath61 reads as following : @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the crystal - field parameters for the @xmath62 symmetry , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the stevens coefficients .",
    "the former are unknown for the tb@xmath3 ion in @xmath0 . however , our results depend only weakly on the actual crystal - field parameters since the magnetic properties of @xmath0  are essentially controlled by the magnetic behavior of the iron subsystem and by the ising character of the non - kramers tb@xmath3 ion in the crystal field of the trigonal symmetry .",
    "we hence could not determine the crystal - field parameters from the experimental data .",
    "instead , we have used the crystal - field parameters of the isostructural compounds , in particular the rare - earth aluminoborates ( see e.g. ref .  ) and refined these using the data for crystal - field splitting of nd@xmath3 in @xmath72 .",
    "@xcite    we have written the expressions for the molecular fields acting on the tb and fe ions from the @xmath53-th sublattice on the basis of the interactions hierarchy and magnetic structure of @xmath0 . a detailed analysis of the interactions which was performed for the low temperature phase of @xmath9  in ref",

    "in particular , our approximation considers the exchange interaction of the fe - subsystem as well as the coupling between fe- and tb - subsystems .",
    "the @xmath120 coupling parameter has been determined and its value is in good agreement with available spectroscopic data .",
    "the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in the iron subsystem has been described with the help of two parameters .",
    "the parameter @xmath103 is responsible for bending the iron magnetic moments in the flop phase , which occurs against the intrachain exchange , and determines the spin - flop transition field ; the parameter @xmath104 is connected with the interchain exchange interaction responsible for the three - dimensional ordering , it controls the neel temperature and magnitudes of the iron magnetic moments for specific temperatures and fields . the relation @xmath121 is naturally fulfilled because the fe - o - fe exchange paths within the chains are much shorter than the interchain exchange paths .",
    "the appearance of two exchange parameters is a special feature of consideration of magnetic properties of the compound with chain structure in the framework of the mean - field approximation , which is known to be of limited validity for description of magnetic lattices of lowered dimensionality . a substantial influence of the magnetoelastic effects which accompany the field - induced phase transition on the value of the molecular parameter responsible for bending the iron magnetic moments in the flop phase has been found .",
