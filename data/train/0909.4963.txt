    "[ fig : primerb]a , is still a smooth connected paracompact flat manifold ( so , in particular , in the lorentzian case it is a nice spacetime ) , but it is _ singular _  the vertex can not be glued back into the space ( without sacrificing either the smoothness or the non - degeneracy of the metric ) , so the geodesics terminating at the hole are endless though incomplete . in fig .",
    "[ fig : primerb]b a similar construction is shown in the two plus one case .",
    "we again remove a wedge and glue together its boundaries ( this time they are half - planes ) . again",
    "the intersection of the faces  this time it is the straight line  can not be glued back into the space and we again have a singularity , this time `` in the form '' of a straight line .",
    "it is the singularities of this type that are our subject .",
    "the reason why they deserve most serious consideration is that they , in fact , deprive general relativity of its predictive power .",
    "indeed , in contrast to the `` usual '' , curvature singularities , these `` topological '' ones are absolutely `` sudden '' : _ nothing _ would tell an observer approaching such a singularity that his world line will terminate in a moment . as we shall see soon , in spacetimes with such singularities everything ( the geometry of the universe , its topology , causal structure , etc . ) may change whimsically and ( apparently ) causelessly .",
    "for example , observers ( like @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the figure ) may think  up to some moment  that they live in the minkowski space .",
    "but after that moment they will discover that without experiencing any acceleration they acquired some speed towards each other .",
    "likewise , in the otherwise minkowskian space time machines or wormholes may appear with no visible cause if their appearance is accompanied by singularities of this kind .",
    "as geroch @xcite stated in this connection : `` thus general relativity , which seemed at first as though it would admit a natural and powerful statement at prediction , apparently does not '' .",
    "two hard questions that immediately arise are :    1 .   how to predict the evolution of the universe ?",
    "we see that anything can happen any time",
    "why do nt we encounter that problem in our everyday life ?    a temptingly simple answer would be this : `` such singularities are unphysical .",
    "they are excluded by  '' in place of the dots a strong argument must stand , or a new ( physically motivated ) postulate .",
    "in this section my goal is to explain why , contrary to what one might expect , it is hard ( if possible at all ) to find that appropriate argument or postulate .      before discussing possible candidates we , of course , have to specify clearly what are `` such singularities '' .",
    "this can be done in many ways , but i shall restrict myself to three most known variants .",
    "references to some others can be found in @xcite .",
    "consider a curve in a spacetime @xmath6 @xmath7 and let @xmath8 be an orthonormal frame parallel transported along @xmath9 . in this frame",
    "we find the components of @xmath9 s velocity and define the following integral : @xmath10\\equiv \\int_{0}^1 \\sqrt{(\\,\\,\\dot{\\!\\!\\gamma}\\,{}^1)^2 + ( \\,\\,\\dot{\\!\\!\\gamma}\\,{}^2)^2 + \\dots}\\,{\\mathrm{d}}\\xi.\\ ] ] called the _",
    "@xmath11-length _ of @xmath9 . in the riemannian case",
    "it is simply the length of the curve . on the other hand , in the minkowski space",
    "the @xmath11-length of a curve is merely its coordinate length in the standard ( cartesian ) coordinates .",
    "clearly , the _ value _ of @xmath11 may depend on the choice of @xmath8 , but its _ finiteness _ does not .",
    "definition an inextendible spacetime is said to be singular ( @xmath11-incomplete ) if there is an _ endless _",
    "curve @xmath12 with a finite @xmath11-length .",
    "obviously , our exemplary spacetime @xmath3 is singular : the blue curve is endless ( to be more precise , it is _ future _ endless ) even though it has a finite @xmath11-length .",
    "definition a singularity is _ quasiregular _ if in the basis @xmath8 the components of the riemann tensor and all its derivatives remain bounded on @xmath12 .",
    "evidently , singularities in flat spacetimes ( including @xmath3 ) are quasiregular .",
    "a _ general _",
    "quasiregular singularity , however , is a much more complex object than simply a punctured plane .",
    "( misner space ) take the minkowski plane @xmath13 and consider the isometry @xmath14 ( it is a lorentzian boost , in fact ) @xmath15 this isometry induces an equivalence relation : a point @xmath16 is equivalent to any point @xmath17 related to it by the isometry : @xmath18 the misner space @xmath19 is defined , see , e.g. , @xcite , as the quotient of the left _ half - plane _",
    "@xmath20 over this equivalence @xmath21 it follows right from the definition ( i drop the proof ) that the misner space is a nice legitimate spacetime , though with a lot of surprising properties .",
    "( a ) the double - arrowed lines connect ( some of ) identified points . (",
    "b ) by purple some of the null cones are shown . ]",
    "( a)(b )    to see some of them it is instructive to isolate the strip @xmath22 as a fundamental region .",
    "then the misner space is obtained simply by identifying the left border of the strip with its right border according to the rule @xmath23 as shown by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : misnb2]a .",
    "so , @xmath19 is a cylinder .",
    "the metric on the cylinder is flat , but the causal structure , is nevertheless quite bizarre . the lower part of the cylinder is obtained by identifying causally disconnected pairs of points and , therefore , causality holds here .",
    "but the upper half originates from the quadrant @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where we identify causally related points , so there are closed causal curves in this part of @xmath19 ( the blue one , for example , originating from @xmath9 ) .",
    "the boundary between these regions is formed by the circle obtained from the geodesic @xmath26 .",
    "the fate of the other null geodesics of @xmath20 differ : the vertical ones map to generators of the cylinder ( as , for example , @xmath27 does ) . and",
    "the horizontal null geodesics , like @xmath28 , say , turn into spirals which infinitely wind themselves approaching the horizon and never crossing it .",
    "the timelike curves in @xmath20 which do not cross the ray @xmath26 behave the same way , see the green curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : misnb2 ] .",
    "their images in the misner space being sandwiched between two null spirals also infinitely approach the horizon and , correspondingly , have no end points .",
    "so , we have a lot of endless curves with finite @xmath11-lengths .",
    "thus the misner space is _ singular_. and as the metric is flat the singularity is quasiregular ( even though it is so different from that considered above ) .",
    "let us consider one more singularity .",
    "the banks of the slits are identified ( which implies that they lie in isometric domains ) so that the green and the blue lines become continuous .",
    "if the isometry can be extended from the mentioned domains to the entire @xmath29 , the result of the surgery is the double covering of @xmath30(a sphere of co - dimension 2 ) . ]",
    "pick two isometric regions ( of , perhaps , different spacetimes ) . remove a closed disk from one of them , the corresponding disk from the other , and identify the banks of the slits as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpb1 ] : the upper bank of either slit is glued to the lower bank of the other .",
    "the edges of the disks [ in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional case these will be circles @xmath31 can not be glued back in the space , so the spacetime is singular .",
    "example[ex : dp ] two equal spacelike slits separated by time are made in the minkowski plane .",
    "the banks of the slits are identified as shown in fig .",
    "black curves 1 and 2 are continuous . ( a )",
    "the purple curve is timelike and closed .",
    "( b ) shadowed is the region where causality does not hold .",
    "[ dpb2 ] the resulting spacetime @xcite contains closed causal curves  the purple one , for example  and is referred to as the deutsch - politzer ( dp ) time machine .",
    "later we shall use a slightly different spacetime , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dpb1]b , called the twisted deutsch - politzer ( tdp ) space .",
    "it is obtained the same way as the dp space , but one of the banks before being glued to the other is mirror inversed . the tdp space is non - orientable , but this does nt matter much , because its 4-dimensional analogue can be made orientable .",
    "what does matter is that a typical null geodesic entering the domain of causality violation has a self - intersection .",
    "both spacetimes in example  [ ex : dp ] have singularities .",
    "however , if we had glued the banks in the `` normal '' way we would have been able to remove the singularities arriving simply at the minkowski space . to capture this idea hawking and ellis introduced @xcite the concept of local extendability :    definition a spacetime @xmath6",
    "is said to be _ locally extendible _ if it contains an open set @xmath32 such that ( i ) the closure of @xmath32 is non - compact , but ( ii ) @xmath32 is isometric to a subset @xmath33 of a spacetime @xmath34 in which cl@xmath35 is compact .    loosely speaking , locally extendible spaces are those where some points are missing which `` might have '' existed .",
    "the dp space is obviously locally extendible ( for example , the closure of the ball @xmath32 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dpb1]a , is evidently non - compact , while the closure of @xmath33 , which is isometric to @xmath32 , is compact ) and so is @xmath3 .",
    "the concept of local extendability operates with a spacetime as a whole , with no reference to anything like evolution .",
    "there is an alternative concept , however , formulated in causal rather than in topological terms .    first ,",
    "for a given set @xmath36 we define the domain of dependence @xmath37 to be the collection of all points @xmath16 such that every past endless curve through @xmath16 meets @xmath36 .",
    "let , for example , @xmath36 be a line of constant time in the minkowski plane .",
    "its domain of dependence is the whole upper half - plane . at the same time in the cone",
    "@xmath3 the domain of dependence of the `` same '' line does not include the pale purple region , see fig .",
    "[ fig : primerb]a .",
    "indeed , through any point of this region there is a past endless curve ( like that drawn in brown ) which does not meet @xmath36 .",
    "such curves appear , of course , due to the `` missing '' points and hence the definition .",
    "definition a space - time @xmath38 is called _ hole - free _ if it has the following property : given any achronal hypersurface @xmath36 in @xmath6 and any metric preserving embedding @xmath39 of an open neighbourhood of @xmath37 into some other spacetime @xmath40 , then @xmath41 .    in other words ,",
    "a hole - free space is that where the domain of dependence of any surface is `` as big as possible '' .",
    "clearly , the spacetime @xmath3 is not hole - free .    summing up",
    ", the singularity in @xmath3 is a quasiregular singularity . at the same time",
    "@xmath3 is a locally extendible spacetime . and",
    ", finally , @xmath3 is is not hole - free . which of these properties should be forbidden ?        in their pioneering paper on quasiregular singularities",
    "@xcite ellis and schmidt speaking through salviati say : `` we know lots of examples of quasiregular singularities , all constructed by cutting and gluing together decent space - times ; and because of this construction , we know that these examples are not physically relevant . '' but this argument  in spite of its popularity  is emphatically untenable : the cuttings and gluings that we used are not _ a property _ of the relevant spacetimes , they only are a means of description .",
    "_ any _ spacetime can be constructed by cutting and gluing together some other decent spacetimes and _ any _ of them can be constructed otherwise .",
    "the spacetimes with the singularities in discussion are absolutely no different in this respect from the others .",
    "yet another idea was to take into consideration the einstein equations and to show that quasiregular singularities appear only in spacetimes with the stress - energy tensor of a very special type .",
    "then matter of that type could have been declared unphysical and the whole problem would have been solved .",
    "this program , however , does not work .",
    "at least , not in the general case . indeed , pick an arbitrary spacetime @xmath42 and define @xmath6 to be the double covering of @xmath30(a sphere of co - dimension 2 ) .",
    "@xmath6 can be visualized as the result of the surgery described in the beginning of section  [ sec : locext ] .",
    "the missing sphere gives rise to a quasiregular singularity in @xmath6 , but since the spacetime @xmath42 was chosen arbitrarily , @xmath6 can be built obeying the einstein equations with an arbitrarily nice right - hand side .",
    "moreover , the same would be true for _ any _ local condition which one could impose on spacetimes .",
    "so , we conclude that generally    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ no local condition can exclude quasiregular singularities . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _      maybe then we should forbid a realistic spacetime to be locally extendible @xcite ? indeed , the singularities considered in section  [ sec : locext ] appeared , as hawking and ellis put it , only because we were perverse enough to extend the top and bottom sides of the slits `` wrong way '' .",
    "so , if we consider a four - dimensional spacetime as a result of some `` evolution '' ( the evolution , say , of a three - dimensional space with time ) , such a postulate seems self - suggesting .",
    "what it says is , loosely speaking , the following . in its evolution",
    "a spacetime at every moment of time has to choose between developing a quasiregular singularity and avoiding it , and the spacetime always choose the latter .",
    "however , as beem and ehrlich showed @xcite , this approach does not work either .",
    "consider    the minkowski plane is locally extendible . ]    a flat cylinder with the period @xmath43 and a map @xmath39 sending each point of the minkowski plane to a point of the cylinder according to the rule @xmath44 ( we wrap the plane around the cylinder , see fig .  [ beem_ehr ] ) .",
    "the part of the hyperbolae shown in fig .",
    "[ beem_ehr ] is mapped to a spiral : a curve which infinitely approaches the circle @xmath45 and has no self - intersections .",
    "a neighbourhood @xmath32 of the hyperbolae , if chosen appropriately ( i.  e. , to be narrow enough ) , will map to its image one - to - one and , obviously , isometrically .",
    "so , the restriction of @xmath39 to @xmath32 is a metric preserving embedding . and , nevertheless , the closure of @xmath46 is compact , while the closure of @xmath32 is not .",
    "thus we conclude that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the minkowski space is locally extendible . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    but a postulate forbidding even the minkowski space is definitely _ too _ strong .",
    "the last possibility is to use `` hole - freeness '' as a criterion and , following geroch s proposal , to `` modify general relativity as follows : the new theory is to be general relativity , but with the additional condition that only hole - free spacetimes are permitted '' @xcite .",
    "the proposal seems to be physically well motivated .",
    "indeed , what happens in the domain of dependence of @xmath36 is causally determined by the data on @xmath36 , so one can easily imagine that the existence itself of a point of @xmath37 is also determined by them and not by the remainder of the spacetime",
    ".    however , this approach fails by exactly the same reason as the previous one : even the minkowski plane is not hole - free .    [ [ proof . ] ] _ proof . _",
    "+ + + + + + + +    let @xmath36 be a hyperbolae in the minkowski plane .",
    "its domain of dependence @xmath37 is the closed set shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ahb ] ; it is bounded ( in particular ) by a past directed null geodesic @xmath9 .",
    "the neighbourhood @xmath32 of @xmath47 is defined to be the left half - plane plus a `` beak '' , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ahb ] .",
    "the beak is characterized by width @xmath48 and is chosen so that @xmath49 the idea is to find for @xmath32 an alternative extension ( not the minkowski plane , but some @xmath34 instead ) and to check that in that extension the domain of dependence of the image of @xmath36 is larger than simply the image of @xmath37 : @xmath50    the extension @xmath34 is built by gluing some portions @xmath51 , @xmath52 of the beak to a rectangular strip @xmath53 : @xmath54 specifically , pick a sequence @xmath55 of negative numbers such that @xmath56 and define @xmath51 as follows : @xmath57 ( for example , the hatched strip in fig .",
    "[ fig : ahb ] cuts @xmath58 out of the beak ) .",
    "further , let @xmath59 be the isometry which sends , for every @xmath60 , each point @xmath61 to the point @xmath62 according to the rule @xmath63 now @xmath34 is defined as the quotient : @xmath64 ( i.  e. , as the result of gluing together @xmath32 and @xmath53 by @xmath65 ) and @xmath39 as the natural projection of @xmath32 to @xmath34 .",
    "i have not specified @xmath66 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "but , in fact , all required of them is that @xmath67 would not not overlap and at the same time the series @xmath68 would converge , where @xmath69 is the maximal width of @xmath51 ( for @xmath55 falling fast enough such a choice of @xmath66 is obviously possible ) .",
    "the above - mentioned convergence implies that there is a null geodesic segment @xmath70  the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ahb ]  to which the null geodesics @xmath71 converge .",
    "it is the existence of @xmath70 that proves and hence the proposition .",

    "so , @xmath74",
    ". + @xmath75",
    "as we have just seen there is no obvious way to expel quasiregular singularities from relativity .",
    "now let us formulate the question the other way round : are there any indications that quasiregular singularities do exist , or may appear under favorable conditions ? at first glance the property which makes such singularities interesting  their `` suddenness ''  makes at the same time their appearance unlikely .",
    "indeed , if everything prior to the singularity looks _ as if _ the spacetime is singularity - free , why not assume that it _ is _  and will remain  singularity - free . actually , however , the situation is somehow less trivial .",
    "i think , two possibilities are of interest here .",
    "let us start with the more subtle and academic one .        in our consideration",
    "we have already met two spacetimes  the dp space and the misner space  which evolve nicely up to some moment , but then lose causality ; in other words closed causal curves appear to the future of some globally hyperbolic domain .",
    "the regions where causality breaks down and the entire spacetimes containing them are called _ time machines_.    .",
    "the lengths are measured from a surface @xmath76 .",
    "the thick dashed line is the earliest closed causal ( null ) curve.,scaledwidth=28.0% ]    the most known time machine is probably that based on a wormhole @xcite .",
    "the relevant spacetime , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fabric ] , is obtained , for example , by removing two timelike tubes from the minkowski space and identifying the boundaries of the holes ( the vicinity of the junction is understood to be smoothed out appropriately , so that the junction is seamless ) .",
    "the identification is done as follows : every generator of the left cylinder is glued to the corresponding generator of the right cylinder so that the length of the corresponding segments are equal . in other words ,",
    "the clocks traveling with one mouth of the wormhole are synchronized ( when seen through the throat ) with those left at rest near the other mouth .",
    "clearly , if the right tube is tortuous enough , then the points which are to be identified become causally separated beyond some surface .",
    "so , closed causal curves appear to the future of a globally hyperbolic region and the spacetime becomes a time machine .    at first glance",
    "the mentioned time machines form two  fundamentally different  classes .",
    "the dp time machine , as we discussed , may appear or may not .",
    "one can neither predict its appearance , nor cause it . and it seems to be completely different with the wormhole - based time machine or the misner space , where one prepares suitable initial conditions and waits until the spacetime governed by the einstein equations gives birth to a closed causal curve .",
    "so , one can even think that time machines are divided into spontaneously appearing and artificially manufactured .",
    "in fact , however , this difference is a sheer illusion .",
    "_ any _ spacetime in its evolution can avoid transformation into a time machine .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    any spacetime @xmath32 has a maximal extension @xmath77 such that all closed causal curves in @xmath78 ( if they exist there ) are confined to the chronological past of @xmath32 .",
    "the proof is quite lengthy , so i shall only illustrate the theorem by the example of the misner space .",
    "denote by @xmath32 its initial , globally hyperbolic part .",
    "an inhabitant of @xmath32 sees that in the course of time the null cones open more and more , see fig .",
    "[ fig : disarm ] .",
    "@xmath32 is the lower ( causality - respecting ) half of the misner space .",
    "the circles designate a `` new '' quasiregular singularity.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    so , he anticipates the unavoidable ( as he might think , knowing from the einstein equations that the spacetime will have to remain flat ) appearance of a time machine ( when the inclined generator becomes horizontal ) .",
    "what the theorem says is that his hopes may be vain : besides the misner space , @xmath32 also has another , _ causality - respecting _ ( and also flat ) maximal extension . to verify this assertion recall that in the misner space the vertical lines generating the cylinder are null geodesics",
    "so , there is a neighbourhood of the brown , say , ray isometric to a neighbourhood of a null ray of the minkowski plane .",
    "the desired extension now can be described as the result of removing these two rays and gluing the right bank of either cut to the left bank of the other ( so that the green and blue curves in fig .  [ fig : disarm ] are continuous ) .",
    "that causality holds in the thus constructed extension is obvious .",
    "note , however , that this is achieved at the cost of allowing a new quasiregular singularity to appear .",
    "it s important that by `` spacetime '' in the theorem not just a smooth connected hausdorff pseudo - euclidean manifold is understood .",
    "one can impose _ any _ additional condition and , as long as it is local ( like the einstein equations ) , the theorem remains true @xcite .",
    "summing up , whatever we do within general relativity we can not force the universe to give birth to a time machine .",
    "what we _ can _ do , however , is force the universe to _ choose _ between creating a time machine , or a quasiregular singularity . and",

    "[ fig : suic]a , and shoot the latter dead .",
    "it is clear that his plan can not be realized .",
    "what is _ not _ obvious is what actually will happen .",
    "let us reformulate the situation in more general terms .",
    "we have a system in some initial state ( an armed person in a room where a time machine is to appear ) .",
    "the system is governed by some quite plausible laws of motion ( the person must wait for 5 minutes then make a few steps , raise the rifle , and pull the trigger ) .",
    "there is nothing pathological either in the initial state , or in the laws of motion . in a globally hyperbolic spacetime",
    "they would uniquely determine the evolution of the system .",
    "but , because the spacetime contains a time machine , we are facing a paradox : no evolution corresponds to the specified combination of the initial state and laws of motion .",
    "how should this be interpreted ?    a possible solution is this .",
    "the system in consideration is highly complex and actually we did not specify its laws of motions accurately enough .",
    "so , it might happen that we are just overlooking the solution .",
    "for example , one can advocate the evolution depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : suic]b : the experimenter is wounded ( not killed ! ) and it is the wound that in due time prevents him from shooting accurately and thus leads to wounding the target instead of killing it .",
    "such reasonings may lead one to the following    conjecture[conj ] any reasonable laws of motion being combined with any reasonable initial state must correspond to some evolution whether or not a time machine appears .    to cast doubt on this conjecture and to construct a time travel paradox",
    "@xcite it is instructive to analyze a toy model of this situation . consider the twisted dp universe , see example  [ ex : dp ] , populated only by pointlike particles , whose evolution is determined by the following simple laws .    1",
    ".   particles move along null geodesics ; 2 .   they can not appear from nothing or disappear ( local conservation ) ; 3 .",
    "their interaction reduces to the vertex shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpseudopar]a .    at first glance",
    "it might seem that already the initial data shown in fig .",

    "so , if the particle enters the time machine it must hit its younger self in the point @xmath65 thus preventing the latter from getting into the time machine .",
    "but if this younger particle does change its trajectory and fly away , then where the older particle ( the second participant of the collision ) came from ?",
    "a paradox , apparently .",
    "the entire reasoning , however , is based on the false implicit assumption that the number of particles is a conserved quantity .",
    "so , if there was a single particle on the surface @xmath79 , then there must be only one particle on the surface @xmath80 too .",
    "but this global conservation does nt follow from our laws ( @xmath81@xmath82 ) and no reasons at all are seen to impose it as a separate additional law . and",
    "as soon as we abandon it , a nice solution appears satisfying all those laws : it contains _ two _ different particles .",
    "one of them has a closed world line .",
    "the other collides with that former one in @xmath65 and bounces away from the time machine .    to exclude such a solution we can sophisticate the model .",
    "let now the particles be of two different kinds : dark and light and the interaction is defined by this table        the laws look quite realistic in the sense that they are local and respect all the symmetries of the problem . and",
    "again at first glance it seems that there is no evolution from the initial data of fig .",
    "[ fig : tpseudopar]b : one can not assign in a consistent way a tint to the closed world line in the figure .",
    "indeed , it is a single particle , so it must have the same tint all along , but according to the laws that we have adopted the incoming left and the outgoing left particles always have different tints .    and",
    "still this is not a paradox yet . in fig .",
    "[ fig : uslozhcvx ] we see one of the admissible solutions .",
    "there are three light particles in this world : one is emitted in @xmath65 and escapes to infinity and two others are born in the collision at @xmath83 . of them one is absorbed in @xmath65 and the other disappears in the singularity.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    it contains three dark and three light particles .",
    "the former include the particle coming from infinity to the point @xmath65 , another one , emitted in @xmath65 and absorbed in @xmath83 , and , finally , the particle emerging from the singularity to be absorbed in @xmath83 .",
    "this is a legitimate evolution satisfying all the laws formulated above .",
    "now we have discovered all pitfalls and the next sophistication brings us the desired paradox @xcite .",
    "namely , suppose that every particle in the world under discussion has one more characteristic , let us call it color .",
    "there are three different colors and the particles of different colors do not interact . then the initial state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nparadob ] does not     any evolution must include the solid lines as world lines of particles .",
    "it also may include some of the dashed lines , but nothing else.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    correspond to any evolution .",
    "indeed , any solution must have three self - intersecting world lines to the future of @xmath84 .",
    "only two of them may be affected by collisions with particles of the same color ( the possible world lines of such particles are shown by dashed lines ) .",
    "so , the tint of at least one particle with the self - intersecting world line remains constant , which , as discussed above , contradicts the laws of interaction .",
    "of course , this model is _ very _ simple .",
    "nevertheless , it strongly suggests that conjecture  [ conj ] is false and in some cases the configuration of the matter fields may exclude the appearance of a time machine .",
    "if so , we come to a rather unexpected conclusion :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ by arranging matter particles one can make some of geometrically admissible extensions of a given spacetime impossible . _",

    "a pertinent consequence is that all one needs to create a quasiregular singularity is a wormhole and a rifle .",
    "then forcing the universe to choose between the singularity and the time machine one can make at the same time the appearance of the latter impossible .",
    "now let us turn to another relevant environment , which is the early universe .",
    "in this section i briefly remind the reader the arguments suggesting that there are cosmic strings in nature ( all details can be found in @xcite ) and then reproduce them in a purely gravitational case to show that the existence of string - like singularities ( a variety of quasiregular singularities ) is equally realistic .",
    "suppose , after the universe had cooled below some critical temperature , a complex scalar field @xmath85 appeared     ( a ) the potential has the minimum at @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is real , but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "( b ) the arrows are complex numbers of the same modulus @xmath88 ( the values of @xmath85 ) and not three - vectors.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    ( a)(b )    with the potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : risb1]a .",
    "one expects the field to take the value @xmath88 corresponding to the minimal energy .",
    "but the evolutions of the field in different regions are _ uncorrelated _ and this can make the process of taking this value by the field energetically prohibited _ globally _ even though _ locally _ it is energetically favorable . indeed , suppose on some loop @xmath89 the field happened to take values like those depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : risb1]a .",
    "then , evidently , on a surface enclosed by @xmath89 there will be a point at which the field vanishes .",
    "the energy density in that point will be , on the contrary , non - zero ( because @xmath90 ) .",
    "now we can deform the disk .",
    "the same reasoning will show that there is a non - vacuum spot on the new surface , too .",
    "so , what we have is actually not just a single spot of non - zero energy density but an endless curve ( either infinite , or closed ) , or rather an endless thin tube , because they must be of finite  though small  thickness .",
    "the tubes are stable : even though they are surrounded by vacuum , they can not dissolve for the topological reasons just discussed .",
    "it is such tubes that are called cosmic strings .",
    "an important thing about cosmic strings is their gravitational fields . in particular ,",
    "the universe with a straight cosmic string is believed to be described  _ at large @xmath91 _  by the spacetime depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : primerb]b , or rather , by its four - dimensional analog @xmath92 in other words , at large @xmath91 the straight cosmic string produces the same gravitational field as the singularity considered in the introduction .",
    "when a string moves through the cosmological fluid it leaves a wake behind it : as is seen from fig .",
    "[ risb3]a     identify the thin line to obtain the section @xmath76 , @xmath93 of the spacetime with a cosmic string along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "in fact , such a section is just a flat cone with a smooth cap.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    ( a)(b )    two _ parallelly _ moving galaxies may nevertheless collide after a string has passed between them  a phenomenon of obvious importance to cosmology . on the other hand , two light rays emitted from the same source may , by exactly the same reasons , come to an observer from different directions , see fig .",
    "[ risb3]b .",
    "thus , a string acts as a gravitational lens producing multiple images of a single object .",
    "note that both rays propagate in flat spacetime , so the images are neither distorted , nor fuzzy .",
    "they may differ , however , because we see the source from different angles .",
    "now let us apply all the above to the purely gravitational case . in the end of the planck era",
    "the classical spacetime had emerged and started to expand obeying the einstein equations . by the time it could be confidently called classical it was practically flat ( by planck s standards , anyway ) ,",
    "so we can speak of the emergence ( whatever it means ) of a flat spacetime .",
    "one can think , however , that remote regions evolved uncorrelatedly    each patch tends to develop into the minkowski space .",
    "but as they do so independently , global obstruction may appear resulting in formation of `` topological defects ''  string - like singularities.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    and again the locally favorable process ( of becoming minkowskian ) might be impeded by some _",
    "global _ obstructions .",
    "exactly as with matter fields , such obstructions must have given rise to singularities .",
    "this time , however , these would be true _",
    "geometrical _ singularities and exactly of the type we are considering  singularities in the otherwise minkowski spacetime .",
    "of course , this scenario contains some handwaving as we know nothing about how the classical space emerges , but the beauty of it is that we almost do not need to .",
    "suppose , for example , that a circle lying in a newborn ( non - simply connected ) flat region happened to be too short ( or too long ) for its radius of curvature .",
    "then we do not , in fact , need to know anything else to conclude that when the spacetime eventually becomes entirely classical and flat it will contain a quasiregular singularity ( presumably , it will be similar to the straight - line one considered in the introduction and will be represented by an endless  though not necessarily straight  line ) .",
    "this scenario seems so natural and convincing that i think the appearance of quasiregular singularities in the early universe is at least as realistic as appearance of cosmic strings .",
    "now suppose quasiregular singularities did appear in the early universe and survived to the present day .",
    "what do they look like ?",
    "how do we detect them ?",
    "unfortunately , there is still neither an exhaustive list of such singularities , nor even a detailed classification .",
    "almost all we have is a number of examples , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "one  often referred to as `` straight string ''  is the spacetime .",
    "a few more @xcite are obtained by changing the way in which the two half - planes mentioned in the introduction ( see , fig .  [ fig : primerb]b ) are identified .",
    "if before gluing them together we shift ( or boost ) one of them with respect to the other , the properties of the resulting singularity will change significantly . suffice it to say that if the shift is in the @xmath1-direction the spacetime will contain closed causal curves .",
    "the property shared by all these singularities is that they all in a sense are straight lines at rest .",
    "recently , however , a number of singularities in flat spacetime were found @xcite which are represented , in the same sense , by curved or moving lines .",
    "all such singularities including those `` straight '' ones i shall collectively call _ string - like_.          cylinder coordinates , by the equation @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath20 is ( a half of ) a helicoid without the core , see fig  [ fig : spiral]a , and is bounded by the spiral @xmath98 make a cut in @xmath2 along cl@xmath99 ( note that @xmath100 is removed , too ) , rotate the lower bank of the slit  it is denoted by @xmath101 in the figure  anti - clockwise shifting it at the same time upward so that @xmath102 slides over @xmath101 , and paste the banks together again into a single surface .",
    "the resulting space @xmath103 is smooth , flat , etc . , but it lacks the points that formed @xmath100 ( these points can not be returned back insofar as the metric is required to be smooth ) .",
    "thus , @xmath103 has a quasiregular singularity and this singularity , when @xmath104 , has the form of a spiral ( and is called , accordingly , _ spiral _",
    "the structure of this singularity becomes more transparent when @xmath103 is depicted in the original coordinates @xmath0 , @xmath91 , @xmath105 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : spiral]a .",
    "these coordinates are invalid , of course , on @xmath106 , that is why a smooth curve looks discontinuous in the picture . another curious singularity is obtained if in the previous procedure one sets @xmath107 ( and the full spacetime is obtained by multiplying @xmath103 by the @xmath0-axis ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spiral]b .",
    "it is easy to see that the singularity in this case is represented by a straight line moving in quite a bizarre manner : it _ circles around nothing_. + b ) from        the ordinary 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath108 remove a closed circle @xmath109 . then rotate one of the banks ( @xmath110 in fig .",
    "[ loop]a ) of the thus obtained slit w.  r.  t.  the other ( @xmath101 , correspondingly ) by some @xmath111 , and , finally , glue the banks together . the resulting space is shown in fig .",
    "[ loop]b , where as usual we use the old coordinates ( so , the blue curve is actually continuous ) .",
    "the missing circumference @xmath100 ( as before , it can not be glued back into the space ) is a closed string - like singularity called _ loop_. it is convenient to think of the spacetime as the euclidean space minus the circumference plus the rule that a curve meeting the disk in some point @xmath16 is continued from the point obtained from @xmath16 by rotation by @xmath111 .",

    "field & determined by ( field eqs + einstein eqs ) & rigid + * *        in contrast to the strings , the singularities are in the _ empty _ space .",
    "so , their evolution is _ not _ connected to properties of any field and , in particular , is not described by the nambu action .",
    "the cosmic strings , unlike the singularities , can bend , curving the spacetime around ( in particular , they can emit gravitational waves ) . on the other hand ,",
    "both entities have similar mechanisms of formation and stability , both produce wakes and , finally both may give rise to multiple images of a single source .",
    "( a ) the line of sight ( the orange line ) of the observer located in @xmath16 ends up at the object which he also sees when looks in the direction shown by the purple arrow .",
    "( b ) the object seen through the disk looks rotated ( w.  r.  t.  all three axes  blue , green , and red ) in comparison with the same object observed directly.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]      consider the loop singularity from example  [ ex ] and an observer who looks in the direction of the singularity , see fig  [ fig : lensing]a .",
    "his line of sight after reaching the disk jumps , changes its direction and may end on an object which he could see somewhere aside .",
    "thus he will see _ two _ images of the same source  one in the direction shown by the orange ray and another in the direction of the purple ray .",
    "equivalently , one can pick a source seen out of the disk and rotate it in one s mind by @xmath111 , see fig  [ fig : lensing]b .",
    "if it gets behind the disk one will see both images .",
    "note that generally the images differ , because one sees the object from different angles .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : observ]a . then following the prescription given above we rotate the galaxy by @xmath111 w.  r.  t.  the axis of the disk @xmath109 corresponding to the singularity , and find that ( for a suitable size of the loop and value of @xmath111 ) a terrestrial observer would see two images of the galaxy , see fig .",
    "[ fig : observ]b . the second image must be rotated w ,  r.  t. to the other one to make allowance for the effect mentioned above , so , it will look as in fig .  [",
