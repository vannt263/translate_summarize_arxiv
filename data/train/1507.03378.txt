    "this paper seeks to investigate the appearance of periodic and non - periodic cycles in the time series of stock market returns .",
    "the analysis of the existence of cycles and trends in stock indexes provides us with an essential contribution to the understanding of market efficiency and the distribution of stock indexes returns .",
    "cycles in the economic data have been studied extensively @xcite , resulting in a number of stylized facts that characterize some cyclical or seasonal effects to financial time series @xcite .",
    "the study of cycles in economic data dates back to the early 1930s @xcite .",
    "various techniques to measure seasonality have been widely applied , combining ideas from mathematics , physics , economics and social sciences .",
    "these efforts have resulted in research findings of , among other , intraday trading effects @xcite , weekend and/or three - day effects @xcite , intramonth effects @xcite , quarterly and annual cycles @xcite , and various multi - year cyclical variations in stock market index returns @xcite . a consensus of opinion on the nature or the character of cyclic effects , however , has not been reached .",
    "financial markets belong to a class of human - made systems exhibiting complex organization and dynamics , and similarity in behavior @xcite .",
    "complex systems have a large number of mutually interacting parts , are often open to their environment , and self - organize their internal structure and dynamics , which produce various forms of a large - scale collective behaviors .",
    "they operate simultaneously at different scales .",
    "the outputs of such systems , time series of records of their activity , display co - existence of collectivity and noise @xcite ; the complexity of systems is reflected in time series that exhibit a wealth of dynamic features , including trends and cycles on various scales @xcite . the tools to study such systems",
    "thus can not be analytical , but rather must be adapted to enable accurate quantification of their long - range order . in this sense , we have chosen to contribute to the debate about the existence and types of cycles in stock market data in two ways : by way of applying wavelet spectral analysis @xcite to study market returns data , and through the use of hurst exponent formalism @xcite to study local behavior around market cycles and trends .",
    "firstly , we utilized wavelets to study cyclical consistency in time series of stock market indexes ( smis ) .",
    "wavelet analysis is appropriate for such a task ; it was originally introduced to study complex signals @xcite .",
    "we use wavelet - based spectral analysis , which estimates the spectral characteristics of a time - series as a function of time @xcite , revealing how the different periodic components of a particular time - series evolve over time .",
    "it enables us to compare stock market index time series wavelet spectra from different economies , to examine the similarities in contributions of cycles at various characteristic frequencies to the total energy spectrum , to observe when exactly these contributions happen in time for different economies , and to compare if the ups and downs of each cycle occur simultaneously in different smi series . with this tool we can attempt to address the question of whether the complexity of a financial market is specifically limited to the statistical behavior of each smi time series or parts of an smis series complexity",
    "can be attributed to the overall world market @xcite .",
    "we use the hurst exponent formalism to attempt to address the question of what type , or types , of cyclical behavior smi data possess . in recent years",
    ", the application of the hurst - exponent - based analyses has led many researchers to conclude that financial time series possess multi - scaling properties @xcite .",
    "in addition , these methods have allowed for the examination of local scaling around a given instance of time , so that the complex dynamical properties of various time series can be analyzed locally rather than globally @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the time dependent hurst exponent approach to test the local character of cycles at various characteristic frequencies of smi time series from different economies . in doing",
    "so we aim to compare the behavior of each cycle across stock markets and to find ways to classify various markets according their cyclical behavior .",
    "we use the wavelet and the hurst exponent approach to analyze three types of smi time series : data belonging to stock markets of developed economies , emerging economies , and of the underdeveloped or transitional economies .",
    "previous and recent work by our group and others has demonstrated that smi series exhibit scaling properties connected to the level of growth and/or maturity of the economy the stock market is embedded in @xcite , and that all the smi series exhibit the effects of various periodic or non - periodic cycles that are visible in their wavelet spectra @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that in emerging or transitional markets stock indexes do not fully represent the underlying economies @xcite , therefore we wanted to tailor our smi study with this in mind and differentiate between underdeveloped ( transitional ) economies , emerging economies , and developed economies .",
    "our study is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "2 . we give a brief overview of the smi dataset and the variables that we study . in sec .",
    "we describe the general framework of the wavelet transform ( wt ) spectral analysis and the specificities of the use of the morlet wavelet basis for the transformation we apply on our dataset .",
    "we apply the wt framework to study the appearance and consistency of cycles across stock markets , and we present our results within this section . in addition , within sec .",
    "we have also investigated the statistical effects of the observed seasonal behavior on the spectral behavior of our smi data . in sec .",
    "we give an introduction to the technique of time - dependent hurts exponent analysis and present the specificities of the detrended moving average ( dma ) method and its time - dependent variation ( tddma ) .",
    "we then list the results of the use of tddma on our smi data , and develop a quantitative indicator ( that we have dubbed the development index ) , which may help classify the level of development of a particular market according to the markets local cyclical behavior .",
    "we end our paper with a list of conclusions and a few suggestions for future work in sec .",
    "in this paper , we investigate data from the following stock markets : the new york stock exchange nyse index , the standard & poor s 500 ( s&p500 ) index , the uk ftse 100 index , the tokyo stock exchange nikkei 225 index , the french cac 40 index , and the german stock market dax index , which we consider developed economies ; the shanghai stock exchange sse composite index , the brazil stock market bovespa index , the johannesburg stock exchange jse index , the turkey stock market xu 100 index , the budapest stock exchange bux index , and the croatian crobex index , which we consider emerging economies ; the tehran tepix index , the egyptian stock market egx 30 index , and the indexes of the developing economies in the western balkans - the belgrade stock exchange belexline index , the montenegrin montex 20 index , the sasx 100 index of the market of bosnia and herzegovina and the birs index of bosnian entity republic of srpska , representing markets of underdeveloped economies . table 1 .",
    "lists general characteristics of the smi time series which we have analyzed ; depending mainly on the market development level , they are of varying duration .",
    "the variables studied in our paper are the daily price logarithmic returns that are defined as @xmath0 + where @xmath1 is the closure price of the stock market index at day @xmath2 , and the lag period @xmath3 is a time interval of recording of index values @xmath1 .",
    "all of the analyzed time series of prices on the stock markets @xmath1 are publicly available ( from the official web - sites of the markets in question or from the yahoo finance database ) , and are given in local currencies .",
    "the values of the smi data are listed only for trading days  that is , they are recorded according to the market calendar , with all weekends and holidays removed from datasets .    ]",
    "the wavelet transform ( wt ) was introduced @xcite in order to circumvent the heisenberg uncertainty principle problem in classical signal analysis , and achieve good signal localization in both time and frequency that a classical fourier transform approach lacks .",
    "namely , in wt the window of examination length is adjusted to the frequency analyzed : slow events are examined with a long window , whilst a shorter window is used for fast events . in this way an adequate time resolution for high frequencies and a good frequency resolution for low frequencies",
    "is achieved in a single transform @xcite .",
    "the continuous wavelet transform @xcite of a discrete sequence @xmath4 is defined as the convolution of @xmath4 with wavelet functions @xmath5 in the following way : @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the scale and translation - in - time ( coordinate ) parameters , and @xmath9 the total length of the smi series studied .",
    "the wavelet functions @xmath5 , used in eq.(2 ) , are related to the scaled and translated version of the mother - wavelet @xmath10 , through @xmath11 + in order to examine the existence of cycles in smi data , we used the wavelet scalegrams ( mean wavelet power spectra ) @xmath12 , that are defined by @xmath13 + the scalegram @xmath12 can be related @xcite to the corresponding fourier power spectrum @xmath14 via the formula @xmath15 + this formula implies that if the two spectra , @xmath12 and @xmath14 , exhibit power - law behavior , then they should have the same power - law exponent @xmath16 .",
    "the meaning of the wavelet scalegram is the same as that of the classical spectrum - it gives a contribution to the signal energy at a specific scale parameter @xmath7 .",
    "we are thus able to view and estimate the peaks of wavelet spectra in the same way as one would approach this problem in a classical fourier approach .      in this paper , we find it convenient to follow the choice of many researchers before us and use the standard set of morlet wavelet functions as a wavelet basis for our analysis .",
    "the choice of the wavelet is an important aspect of any wt analysis , as the wavelet coefficients @xmath17 contain combined information on both the function we analyze and the analyzing wavelet @xcite . in applying the wt method",
    "it is important to choose a mother - wavelet that is well localized in both time and frequency , and is at least of zero mean ( of course , these properties remain valid for the corresponding generated wavelet functions @xmath18 ) .",
    "the morlet wavelet @xcite has proven to possess this optimal joint time - frequency localization @xcite , and can thus be used for detecting locations and spatial distribution of singularities in time series @xcite .",
    "the morlet set is defined by @xmath19 with the corresponding fourier transform @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the heaviside step function , @xmath23 is the fourier circular frequency , and @xmath24 is the characteristic nondimensional parameter ( a real number ) . for the morlet wavelet ,",
    "the relation between the scale and the frequency is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a real number that characterize the particular wavelet .",
    "in our study we use @xmath27 .",
    "we have calculated wt power spectra for all our smi series , and for all the periods ( durations ) these data series were available to us .",
    "we took into consideration only the values of the wt spectra between the minimum time scale of @xmath28 and the statistically meaningful maximum time scale @xcite of @xmath29 , and searched for characteristic peaks ( local maxima ) within those limits .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] . depicts the typical findings we got for all our smi series , represented by the wt spectra of the dax returns series ( as a primer of a developed market ) , xu 100 returns series ( representing emerging markets ) , and tepix returns series ( representing the underdeveloped economies ) . from figure [ fig1 ] characteristic peaks , or rather characteristic cycle periods around characteristic peaks , can be recognized on different time scales .",
    "these include :    \\1 . the working week cycle , or the peak around 5 days .",
    "this peak is visible in all our smi series , with the exception of the tepix series , where it is lacking altogether .",
    "the exact positions of the peak are not the same in all the series , but all the peaks are embedded in the period ( equivalent to the frequency band in a classical fourier case ) of 2 days to 6 days ( see figure [ fig1 ] , where the borders of all periods are drawn around the corresponding peaks ) .",
    "the peak around 7 days , which probably belongs to a calendar - week cycle .",
    "this peak is not visible in xu 100 and sse series , while it is visible in all other smi series . in all the series where it is visible",
    ", this peak is embedded in the period of 6 to 10 days .",
    "the peak around 14 days , probably tracing a two - week cycle .",
    "this peak is visible in all out smi series .",
    "the period that surrounds this peak is from 10 days to 25 days .",
    "in addition to this peak , some series show a very near one at around 20 days ( probably equivalent to a three - week cycle ) ; this additional peak appears in ftse 100 , nyse , cac 40 , dax and sse markets .",
    "since the 20-day peak appears in only few ( developed ) economies , we have decided not to list it as a separate cycle , just to mention it in the text .",
    "it is also depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    ", where the border around it is drawn with dotted vertical line .",
    "+ 4 . the monthly cycle , or the peak around 30 days .",
    "it is present in all our smi series , and is embedded in the period between 25 days and 60 days . at this point in time , again , an additional peak appears in some of our smi series . where it exists , this peak is positioned at around 45 days , and it appears in ftse 100 , s&p 500 , cac 40 , dax , xu 100 , bovespa and egx 30 markets .",
    "for the same reasons as above , we have chosen just to mention this cycle here ( and have shown it s border with dotted vertical line in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "+ 5 . the quarterly cycle , or the 90-day peak .",
    "this peak was found in all our smi series , and it is positioned in the region between 60 days and 110 days .",
    "+ 6 . the 4 - 5 month cycle , or the 150-day peak .",
    "this peak was found in all our smi series , and is positioned in the region between 110 days and 190 days .",
    "the 6 - 7 month peak , or the semi - annual cycle .",
    "this peak is not visible in all our underdeveloped smi series , and in the nyse and nikkei 225 series .",
    "where it appears , the peak is positioned in the period between 190 and 250 days .",
    "the annual cycle , or the peak around 360 days .",
    "this peaks was not found in ftse 100 , sse and egx 30 series . in all other cases ,",
    "it is embedded in the region between 250 days and 450 days .",
    "+ 9 . the bi - annual cycle , or the 600-day peak .",
    "this multi - year cycle was found in all our smi series .",
    "it is embedded in a time interval between 450 days and 950 days .",
    "other multi - year cycles have been found in the series of developed economies .",
    "these data series contain sufficient data points that enable the calculation of wt spectra on higher scales .",
    "due to our inability to investigate the existence of these peaks in all our data , we will just mention them here , but will not label them in the way we labelled other peaks and peak regions .      in order to be able to compare and characterize the obtained wavelet spectra of our stock market data , we have calculated relative energy content and relative amplitude of all the regions ( periods , bands ) under characteristic peaks in all our data series .",
    "the relative energy content of the @xmath30-th peak in a wt power spectrum is defined @xcite as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the average energy content of the period surrounding the @xmath30-th peak : @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the total energy content of the wt spectrum of the stock market series analyzed .",
    "the energy content is a physical quantity behind a wt power spectrum , so it represents it s natural characteristic .",
    "similarly , the relative amplitude of the spectral band under the @xmath30-th peak is defined as : @xmath35 with @xmath36 its average amplitude , and @xmath37 the total amplitude of the wt power spectrum of the stock market series of interest .",
    "the amplitude of the wt power spectrum depends @xcite on the variability of the frequency ( scale ) band analyzed - the more constant the frequency , the higher the amplitude .",
    "we calculated the relative energy contents @xmath38 and the relative amplitudes @xmath39 for all the obtained peaks in all the analyzed wt spectra .",
    "we then performed statistical analysis of three groups of data sets - those belonging to the developed economies , the emerging markets , and the underdeveloped economies .",
    "we first performed the shapiro - wilk test for normality of distributions within these three data groups .",
    "if normality of distributions existed within our datasets , we performed the one - way anova test to compare our sample means , with the significance level of @xmath40 . if the anova test confirmed the existence of differences of means , the average means for all three groups of data",
    "was compared using the bonferroni method .",
    "if , however , the shapiro - wilk test did not confirm the existence of normality of distributions within our dataset , we performed the kruskal - wallis anova test to compare the means , with the significance level of @xmath40 .",
    "if the kruskal - wallis anova test confirmed the existence of differences in the groups means , the comparison of average means for all three groups of data was done using the wilcoxon mann - witney method .",
    "lists the calculated average values of relative energy content @xmath38 and the relative amplitudes @xmath39 of all the peaks for the three smi groups .",
    "the statistically significantly different values between the groups for each of the peaks are marked in bold - if only one value is bolded , then it differs from the other two market groups in a peak group ; if two values are bolded they differ mutually ; and if all three values have been bolded then all the three market groups values differ from each other .     and b ) the relative amplitudes @xmath39 for all three market groups .",
    "results are depicted for the three peak regions - a small scale region surrounding the peak at 5 days , a mid - scale region surrounding the peak at 150 days , and a large scale region surrounding the peak at 600 days .",
    "squares enclose the @xmath41 of the values within the smi group , while the error bars depict the maximum and the minimum value within the same group.[fig2 ] ]    our results are also illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] , where average values of the relative energy content @xmath38 and the relative amplitudes @xmath39 for all three market groups , and in three peak regions - a small scale region surrounding the peak at 5 days , a mid - scale region surrounding the peak at 150 days , and a large scale region surrounding the peak at 600 days , are depicted .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] and table 2 .",
    "show that in the small scales region ( peaks of up to 90 days ) the values of both the relative energy contents @xmath38 and the relative amplitudes @xmath39 under the spectral peaks for the underdeveloped markets are smaller than the values of the two other groups in a clear , statistically significant manner .",
    "even more so , for the values of the relative energy content @xmath38 for the two small scale peaks ( peaks at 5 days and at 14 days ) , we can statistically differentiate all three market groups .",
    "for the peaks at lager scales ( peaks at 150 days and more ) , the behavior of underdeveloped markets data does not differ from the other two groups , except in the case of a large scale region of the peak at 600 days .",
    "these results can be understood in the light of values of slopes of the wavelet spectra of our entire dataset .",
    "it has been shown that the smi series from the underdeveloped economies have wt spectra that show highly correlated long - range behavior , with the exponent @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the difference of values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the peaks in the small scales region could explain the smaller contribution of small scale peaks to the overall spectral behavior in underdeveloped markets data , which bring about greater contribution of higher scale peaks and consequently higher slopes of wavelet spectra for these data .",
    "further , the slopes of wavelet spectra for the other two groups of market s data ( for developed and emerging economies ) are either close or equal to @xmath43 , which means that contributions of different peaks in wavelet spectra have to be approximately equal .",
    "it seems , therefore , that the transitional markets do not follow the same behavioral pattern as the markets of emerging or developed economies at time scales of days , weeks , and even several months .",
    "our results thus show that measures like @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the peaks in the small scales region could be used for partial differentiation between market economies .",
    "in order to gain another insight into the local complexity of our smi data , and the possibility of finding means to further quantitatively distinguish the three groups of smi data we use , we have applied the time - dependent detrended moving average ( dma ) algorithm to all our smi series .",
    "firstly , in order to study the general statistics of our smi data , we have employed the centered detrended moving average ( cdma ) technique .",
    "the variation of a standard cdma method that we use here @xcite is performed in three consecutive steps . in the first step , for each sequence of @xmath44 , we construct the sequence of cumulative sums @xmath45 . with @xmath9",
    "we assigned the total number of recorded values for a given series ( the smi number @xmath2 plays the role of time ) . in the next step ,",
    "the entire series of @xmath46 is divided into a set of overlapping segments of the length @xmath47 , and a moving average for each segment is calculated . in the next step a new series , the so - called series of detrended walk @xmath48 is calculated , which we get by removing the moving average from the @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 where @xmath47 is the window size .",
    "hence , the moving average function considers @xmath51 data points in the past and same number of points in the future .",
    "finally , one has to calculate the variance about the moving average for each segment and determine the average of these variances over all segments , which brings about the detrended moving average function @xcite @xmath52 + by increasing the segment length @xmath47 the function @xmath53 increases as well .",
    "when the analyzed time series follows a scaling law , the cdma function is of a power - law type , that is , @xmath54 , with @xmath55 . scaling exponent @xmath56",
    "is usually called the hurst exponent of the series @xcite . in the case of short - range data correlations ( or no correlations at all )",
    "@xmath53 behaves as @xmath57 . for data with power - law long - range autocorrelations",
    "one may expect that @xmath58 , while in the long - range negative autocorrelation case we have @xmath59 .",
    "when scaling exists , the exponent @xmath56 can be related to the fourier and wt power spectrum exponent @xmath16 through the scaling relation @xcite @xmath60 .",
    "we applied the time - dependent dma algorithm ( tddma ) @xcite to the subset of data in the intersection of the smi signal and a sliding window of size @xmath61 , which moves along the series with step @xmath62 .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath56 is calculated for each subset and a sequence of local , time - dependent hurst exponent values is obtained .",
    "the minimum size of each subset @xmath63 is defined by the condition that the scaling law @xmath54 holds in the subset , while the accuracy of the technique is achieved with appropriate choice of @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we have chosen windows of up to @xmath65 , with the step @xmath66 for our tddma algorithm , while the scaling features are studied in the nine regions that enclose smi spectral peaks ( listed above and depicted in figure [ fig1 ] . in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we give an example of the calculated tddma values for the three randomly selected representatives of smi market groups , given for a time interval from year 2008 to year 2011 .     ]      in order to be able to quantify the local behavior of smi data , we have built the hurst vectors @xmath67 .",
    "each coordinate of stock market vector @xmath67 corresponds to the mean value of local hurst exponents from a selected interval that includes and borders each peak .",
    "our analysis was performed on nine intervals that separate nine market peaks ( listed in the text above , and defined through the use of wt analysis ) , marked by index @xmath30 ( @xmath68 ) , while @xmath69 counts the smi series . from all these values",
    "we have built the hurst reference smi vector @xmath70 , composed of the mean values of @xmath67 for each coordinate ( peak ) @xmath30 and for all the smis that we have analyzed .",
    "we have done that in order to be able to compare efficiency of stock markets on each of the separate nine time intervals .",
    "the hurst reference smi vector is thus defined as : @xmath71 for @xmath72 different smi indexes in our dataset . in the case of our dataset",
    ", the values of the reference vector @xmath73 are changing with the addition of new smi data ( markets ) , but for @xmath74 this change becomes insignificantly small .    from the two vectors @xmath67 and @xmath75",
    "we have calculated the relative smi hurst unit vectors @xmath76 that we have defined as : @xmath77 the unit vectors @xmath76 give us the information of the direction of the representative point for each market in relation to the hurst reference point that , to a certain accuracy , marks the overall financial status of the markets dataset that we use .",
    "however , in the case of our dataset , the distance of representative points @xmath76 from the hurst reference point did not provide us with any relevant additional information about the market development or efficiency .",
    "this can be demonstrated through the use of the so - called cosine similarity , which is the scalar euclidean product of two @xmath76 vectors , and which can quantify the level of correlation between vectors @xmath76 .",
    "scalar products of @xmath76 are defined as : @xmath78 + where @xmath69 and @xmath16 count smi series ( @xmath79 ) , while @xmath80 numbers peaks ( peak regions ) .",
    "we have arranged values of these scalar products so as to form a correlogram of market development @xmath81 .",
    "the markets correlogram is depicted in figure [ fig4 ] ; it consists of two block matrices that differentiate strong correlations within the group of underdeveloped markets ( upper left corner ) and within the group of developed markets ( lower right corner ) .",
    "the correlogram depicted in figure [ fig4 ] displays the existence of market group that does not belong neither to developed nor to underdeveloped type .",
    "members of this third group - the emerging markets - mainly correlate weakly with other two groups and within the group , and show random unpredictable strong correlations with some members ( markets ) in the developed or underdeveloped market group .",
    "this inability to look alike clearly differentiates emerging markets in correlogram @xmath81 and in figure [ fig4 ] .    .",
    "positive correlations of market s hurst unit vectors are given in shades of blue ( for @xmath82 ) , while negative correlations are depicted in shades of red ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "horizontal and vertical white lines mark , from left to right , borders between groups of underdeveloped , emerging , and developed markets . [ fig4 ] ]      market development correlogram depicted in figure [ fig4 ] prompted us to try to find a unique hurst indicator of market development , based on the projection of market s hurst unit vectors @xmath84 on the direction of development ( or maturity ) of markets dataset analyzed . in order to calculate this indicator ( we dubbed it the development index ) ,",
    "we have firstly defined the direction of development in markets indexes hurst space .",
    "we have made an assumption that the unit vector of development has to be able to link representative points of ideal markets , that is , markets with hurst vectors @xmath85 made of identical values for all the peak intervals @xmath30 .",
    "this could be defined in a following simple way in the general hurst coordinate space : @xmath86 where @xmath87 stands for the @xmath88 vectors made of all unit components . in the next step , in order to project hurst reference vectors to the direction of development , it is necessary to define the representation of the unit vector of development in the hurst space that originates at the hurst reference vector @xmath70 .",
    "the relative ( in relation to the market s hurst reference vector @xmath70 ) direction of development would then be : @xmath89 in the case of our dataset , the values of this new vector s components have not significantly changed with the addition of new smi data to dataset for @xmath74 ( @xmath47 being the number of markets in the dataset analyzed ) .    the relations in eqs .",
    "17 - 19 led us to the value of @xmath90 for our dataset of @xmath72 stock market indexes : @xmath91 with the error for each component @xmath30 being @xmath92 .",
    "we have defined the development index ( di ) as a projection of hurst unit vectors onto this direction of development : @xmath93 graphical illustration of these projections is given in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    ", while the direction of the main axes is given by the unit vector of the direction of developemnt @xmath90 .",
    "the development index @xmath94 is calculated as a projection of hurst unit vectors @xmath84 onto the @xmath90 , which is directed to a portion of hurst space where representative points of developed markets are grouped .",
    "[ fig5 ] ]    values of di for markets in our dataset are given in table [ tab_4 ] .",
    "it is visible from table [ tab_4 ] that the three market categories ( underdeveloped , emerging , and developed markets ) can be differentiated by this order parameter .",
    "we have decided to define the borders that separate our three market categories following the phenomenological arguments we have set in section 4.1 .",
    "namely , the values of the hurst vectors and a correlogram that we have calculated all point to the existence of two distinct groups that are well clustered ( underdeveloped and developed markets ) , divided by a claster of smi time series that transitions between these two groups ( the emerging markets ) .",
    "this is how , in the case of our dataset , we have decided to use the symmetry principle and define the border between the group of developed and emerging markets at @xmath95 , while the underdeveloped and emerging markets are , in our case , separated at @xmath96 ( for our dataset , @xmath97 ) . based on the criterion that we have produced , the egyptian stock market index egx30 would be classified as an emerging market , rather than an underdeveloped market as we initially assumed , while the hungarian bux index would classify as developed rather than the emerging market smi .",
    "[ tab_4 ]    with this procedure we can examine the stock market time series in groups or individually , for any given smi time series .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed spectral properties of time series of stock market indexes ( smis ) of developed , emerging , and underdeveloped ( or transitional ) market economies , in order to examine differences and similarities in their seasonal behavior , and to try to re - classify markets in our dataset according to the character of their cyclical behavior .",
    "we have used two different well established techniques of data analysis to obtain and verify our findings : the wavelet transformation ( wt ) spectral analysis and the time - dependent hurst exponent approach ( tddma ) .    we have found multiple peaks in wavelet spectra of all our smi time series .",
    "moreover , we have found all the peaks positioned at roughly the same times ( or time intervals ) in all our data , which points to the similarity in seasonal behavior across different market economies in our dataset .",
    "we have identified what can be termed a working - week cycle ( or a 5-day peak ) , a one - week cycle ( or a 7-day peak ) , a two - week cycle ( or a 14-day peak ) , a monthly cycle ( or a 30-day peak ) , a quarterly cycle ( or a 90-day peak ) , a 4- to 5-month cycle ( or a 150-day peak ) , a semi - annual cycle ( or a 6- to 7-month peak ) , an annual cycle ( or a 360-day peak ) , and a bi - annual ( or a 600-days ) multi - year cycle in our dataset .",
    "the dissimilarities between smi records from the different economies that we have observed occur only in the lack of a spectral peak in some of the analyzed markets ( in the case of a one - week cycle , a semi - annual cycle , and an annual cycle ) , or a slight lack of synchronization at a particular peak interval ( peaks are not positioned at exactly the same time instances in all the smi series analyzed ) .",
    "this prompted us to conclude that the seasonal behavior in different markets is probably a reflection of universality in market behavior , rather than a local characteristic of a particular economy .",
    "given that financial markets are human - made complex systems , it is plausible to believe that our findings can be explained by the fact that business cycles are a reflection of common human working habits and behavior .",
    "some authors find this commonality even desirable for the optimal functioning of a stock market , as was , for example , shown for the euro monetary area @xcite .",
    "some researchers , on the contrary , claim that these effects are not significant for the effectiveness of a stock market @xcite .    in order to examine whether the observed seasonal adjustments to the behavior of stock markets could be used as an indicator of the level of development or strength of the economy that underlies the specific stock market ,",
    "we have performed a statistical analysis of the properties of wavelet spectra that characterize particular peak behaviors .",
    "we have statistically compared the relative energy content and the relative amplitude of each peak between the three groups of smi series that we have analyzed - those belonging to developed economies , emerging economies and economically underdeveloped ( or transitional ) countries .",
    "we have found that the underdeveloped markets do not follow the same behavioral pattern as emerging or developed economies at time scales of days , weeks , and even several months .",
    "namely , their wt spectra show , in a statistically significant manner , less pronounced effects of fast ( small time scale ) cycles on the overall spectral behavior than in the wt spectra of the smi series from developed and emerging economies .",
    "in contrast , developed economies appear to even out all the cyclical ( peak ) effects in their wt spectra , or even to show a larger influence of the fast ( small time scale ) peak regions on their overall spectral behavior .",
    "the emerging markets spectra behave somewhere in the middle of these two cases .",
    "these observed differences could contribute to the variations in scaling behavior of markets , which has been reported previously @xcite .",
    "it was proven that the economies of underdeveloped countries have wt spectra that show highly correlated long - range behavior , with the exponent @xmath42 ( @xmath58 ) , opposite to emerging and developed economies , which show uncorrelated or even slightly anti - correlated spectral behavior , with @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the observed sensitivity of scaling exponents to the level of development of economies could be related to the findings we present here - to the relative influence of the small scale spectral peaks on the overall smi spectral behavior .",
    "finally , in this paper we propose a way to quantify the level of development of a stock market , based on the relative influence ( or , in some cases , existence ) of wt spectral peak intervals on the overall scaling behavior of smi time series . in order to do that we have used the hurst exponent approach to calculate what we named the development index , which proved , at least in the case of our dataset , to be suitable to rank the smi series that we have analyzed in three distinct groups .",
    "further verification of this method remains open for future studies by us , or by other groups ."
