    "despite more than a century of observing and classifying stars , nature continues to surprise us with exotic and fascinating new species in the stellar zoo . such has been the case with the recent discovery of several otherwise normal h  ii regions that exhibit strong nebular he  ii recombination line emission @xcite .",
    "such emission is unknown in normal h  ii regions : he@xmath7 requires ionizing photons of at least 54 ev to exist in photoionized nebulae , and so is normally seen only in nebulae with very hot stars such as planetary nebulae .",
    "nevertheless , six h  ii regions with nebular he  ii emission have been identified in local group galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "four of these nebulae appear to be ionized by high - excitation wo or wn stars , while one is ionized by the massive x - ray binary lmc x-1 @xcite .",
    "the sixth , the nebula n44c in the lmc , has an uncertain ionization source , and is the subject of this paper .",
    "of all these objects , lmc - n44c is perhaps the most intriguing .",
    "n44c is part of the large h  ii complex n44 , which includes the ob associations lh 47 and lh 48 .",
    "n44c is a very high - excitation nebula , with [ o  iii ] 5007  / h@xmath9 ratios as high as 8 in parts of the nebula , and strong he  ii emission as well @xcite  characteristics common to planetary nebulae .",
    "nevertheless , n44c is too large ( @xmath6 60 arcsec or 14.5 pc diameter ) and too luminous [ l(h@xmath9 ) @xmath6 4.5@xmath1010@xmath11 ergs s@xmath5 , l(@xmath124686 ) @xmath6 6@xmath1010@xmath13 ergs s@xmath5 @xcite ] to be a classical pn . from the observed nebular l(@xmath124686)/l(h@xmath9 ) luminosity ratio , @xcite and @xcite both deduced that an ionizing star would need to have @xmath14 @xmath15 70,000 k , based on non - lte model stellar atmospheres , to account for the observed he  ii emission .",
    "photometric studies of stars in the field of n44c @xcite , show only one likely candidate for the ionizing star  identified as star 2 in @xcite , with v = 14.2 , b ",
    "v = 0.22 @xcite .",
    "yet this star appears to be a normal o star : estimates of the spectral type of this star range between o4 and o7 @xcite .",
    "spectral classification of the star is somewhat uncertain because of contamination from strong emission lines of h , he  i , and he  ii from the surrounding high surface brightness nebula .",
    "determining the spectral type of the star is critical to understanding the nature of the ionization source .",
    "a normal mid to late - type o main sequence star is very unlikely to produce sufficient photons above 54 ev to account for the nebular he  ii emission .",
    "because of this , @xcite hypothesized that n44c is a fossil x - ray - ionized nebula whose x - ray source had switched off in the recent past . on the other hand",
    ", non - lte stellar atmosphere models by @xcite suggest that hot ( @xmath14 @xmath15 50,000 k ) stars near the eddington limit could account for observed nebular he  ii emission in some cases ; such stars would appear as extreme o supergiants . although the published results appear to rule out this hypothesis for the ionizing star of n44c , the uncertainty in determining the spectral type from the optical spectrum suggests that another approach is in order .",
    "in this paper we present a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic study of n44c and its ionizing star .",
    "we have obtained narrow - band imaging and uv / optical spectroscopy of the nebula using both ground - based telescopes and the _ hubble space telescope _ to study the ionization balance and element abundances in the nebula , in order to better understand the ionization mechanism and to look for abundance anomalies that would signal the presence of a highly evolved star .",
    "we have also obtained an ultraviolet spectrogram of star 2 with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on _ hst _ to determine the stellar spectral type free of uncertainties due to nebular contamination .",
    "our goals are to understand better the physical properties of n44c and the ionizing star , and to answer the question of whether star 2 is the actual source of the ionizing photons powering the nebular he  ii emission .    the importance of understanding the origin of this unusual nebular he  ii emission goes beyond the peculiarity of the stars themselves .",
    "numerous metal - poor starburst galaxies exhibit narrow he  ii emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , often interpreted as nebular emission .",
    "this may indicate that unusually hot ionizing stars are relatively common in starbursts .",
    "many do not show wr features however , and so hot o stars may be the cause .",
    "the existence of very hot extreme o stars and wr stars in distant giant h  ii regions will affect the nebular ionization balance and complicate the use of nebular diagnostics to understand the massive star population in distant star - forming regions .",
    "these hot stars may be important in young galaxies as well , and so may have an important effect on the spectral appearance of star - forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "some authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) have identified the he@xmath16-ionizing stars as the putative `` warmers '' , postulated hot wolf - rayet stars which are capable of producing the hard ionizing continuum needed to explain the spectra of some active galactic nuclei ; synthetic spectra of starbursts including such hot stars are also becoming common ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the local examples of these stars need to be studied in greater detail before their applicability to agns and starbursts can be properly assessed .",
    "narrow - band optical images of n44c were obtained as part of a general search for high - excitation h  ii regions in the magellanic clouds .",
    "these images were taken in december 1991 using the 0.9-m telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory .",
    "a tektronix 1024@xmath101024 ccd was used as the detector ; the field covered in each image was 405@xmath17405@xmath18 , at a pixel scale of 04 per pixel .",
    "the seeing at the time of the observations was about 2@xmath18 .",
    "we used narrow - band filters from the rutgers fabry - perot order - sorting set to image the region in h@xmath9 , [ o  iii ] 5007  , he ii 4686  , and the continuum at 5081  .",
    "central wavelengths of the four filters were 4861  , 4993  , 4685  , and 5081  ; all filters have bandwidths of 44   fwhm .",
    "generally , the exposures were short because of the survey nature of the observations : 600 s for h@xmath9 , 300 s each for the [ o  iii ] and 5081   filters , and 900s in the 4686   filter .    for each image",
    ", we subtracted a dc offset determined from the overscan region of each frame , as well as a bias which was constructed from the median of 35 zero exposure images .",
    "the images were flat - fielded using exposures of the illuminated dome taken through the appropriate filter .",
    "seven to ten dome exposures were obtained through each filter and combined by averaging with a sigma - clipping algorithm to reject cosmic rays .",
    "the combined images were normalized to provide a master flat field for each filter , which was then divided into the object frames .",
    "we converted count rates in the reduced emission line images to fluxes using our long - slit 4-m spectra ( see below ) .",
    "we will use these images primarily to measure integrated h@xmath9 and he  ii 4686   luminosities for n44c .",
    "long - slit optical spectra of n44c were also obtained at ctio in december 1991 .",
    "we used the rc spectrograph on the 4-m reflector to obtain both blue and red spectra of the nebula .",
    "grating kpgl1 was used in first order to observe the 3350 - 5500   wavelength region at 3.8   resolution ( fwhm ) , while grating 181 was used in first order with a gg385 order - sorting filter to cover the 4200 - 8500   region at approximately 7    resolution ; a reticon 1200@xmath10400 ccd was the detector .",
    "five 120 s exposures were made with the blue setting and seven 60 s exposures with the red setting ; the exposure times were kept short to avoid overexposure in the very strong [ o  iii ] lines .",
    "the 2@xmath18 by 330@xmath18 slit was oriented n - s and approximately centered on star 2 ; both star 2 and star 1 located about 8@xmath18 to the south were included in the slit .",
    "our reduction of the data followed common practice for two - dimensional spectra .",
    "the dc offset and a bias image were subtracted from the spectral images . a normalized flat - field , constructed from images of the illuminated dome and twilight sky ,",
    "was divided into each frame to correct for both pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations and non - uniform illumination of the slit .",
    "we solved for the wavelength as a function of pixel position using a he - ne - ar arc lamp spectrum , fitting a low - order polynomial function to the line positions .",
    "the rms residuals of the actual to fitted wavelengths were of order 0.1 pixel , or 0.4 - 0.7  .",
    "the spectra were corrected for atmospheric extinction using mean ctio extinction coefficients .",
    "finally , the photometric flux calibration was determined from observations of spectrophotometric standard stars from the list of @xcite , with the red extended data of @xcite .",
    "the standard stars were observed with the slit width opened to 10@xmath18 to reduce slit losses .",
    "at least three standards were observed on each night .",
    "the calibrated images were combined with an averaged sigma - clipping algorithm .",
    "we extracted a one - dimensional spectrum by summing the two - dimensional data over the entire region of emission from n44c , including the ionizing star , and excluding the nebular emission outside the nebular boundary .",
    "our spectra were taken during near full moon , so the sky background was relatively high .",
    "background subtraction for the n44c frames was complicated by the extent of the nebulosity along the slit and by numerous stars within the slit .",
    "nevertheless , we located sufficient regions clear of nebulosity and stars to determine and subtract accurately the sky background .",
    "the background was determined by a linear fit over those regions .",
    "residual [ o  i ] 5577   night - sky emission in the red spectrum amounted to only about 3% of the original line flux , while residual oh sky emission was not detected .",
    "the hg i 4358   airglow line was almost negligibly weak in our blue spectrum ; the [ o iii ] 4363   line , shifted to 4368    by the lmc radial velocity , was thus not affected by airglow contamination .",
    "figure 1 displays our fully calibrated and extracted one - dimensional blue and red spectra .",
    "the reticon spectra suffered somewhat from focus variations due to the wrinkled surface of the chip .",
    "care was taken so that important closely - separated sets of lines , such as h@xmath19 and [ o  iii ] 4363   and the h@xmath0-[n  ii ] group , were in well - focused regions of the detector .",
    "the effects of the focus variations are evident in the distorted profiles of the [ o  iii ] 4959 , 5007   and h@xmath9 lines in the blue spectrum ( figure 1 ) .",
    "n44c - star 2 was observed with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ during cycle 6 .",
    "we employed the low - resolution grating g140l to observe the 1200 - 1765   region in two settings with a resolving power r = @xmath20 @xmath6 2000 .",
    "a journal of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "a loss of guide star lock resulted in a premature end to the shorter - wavelength ghrs observation , with central wavelength 1342  , from the planned 760 s to 235 s. despite this , the spectrum had sufficient signal / noise ( s / n @xmath6 10 per pixel ) for classification of the star .",
    "the redward exposure , with central wavelength 1617  was carried out with the planned exposure time .",
    "the spectra were reduced by the stsci pipeline .",
    "comparison of the blue and red spectra showed excellent photometric consistency in the 18    region of overlap .",
    "we conclude from this that the loss of lock did not affect the photometry of the first spectrum .",
    "we show the merged ghrs spectrogram of star 2 in figure 2 , along with uv spectra of comparison o iii - v stars in the magellanic clouds from @xcite .    immediately following the ghrs observations",
    ", we obtained spectroscopy of the nebula with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) .",
    "the 086 circular aperture was positioned 3@xmath18 north of star 2 , to sample the region of highest surface brightness .",
    "the fos observations were planned to cover the 1200 - 6800   spectral region with five of the high - dispersion ( r = 1200 ) gratings .",
    "the two original fos / bl observations failed because the fos aperture door failed to open during the exposures .",
    "we therefore repeated four of the fos exposures in february 1997 ( excluding g270h ) .",
    "comparison of the g190h exposures taken at the two epochs , and the g570h exposures also , showed good agreement .",
    "therefore , we averaged the multiple g190h and g570h exposures to improve the signal / noise .",
    "these data were also processed with the stsci pipeline , and table 1 gives the journal for these observations .",
    "portions of the fos spectrogram are shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "in addition to the _ hst _ spectroscopy , we obtained wfpc-2 narrow - band images of n44c in cycle 6 to look for evidence of filamentary structure that might indicate a shock and to look for evidence of a companion to star 2 on scales of a few thousand au ( 0.1 arcsec @xmath6 5000 au at the distance of the lmc ) .",
    "we collected images in f502n ( [ o iii ] ) , f547 m",
    "( emission - free continuum ) , f656n ( h@xmath0 ) , and f675w ( red continuum ) .",
    "the telescope was positioned so that star 2 was centered in chip wf2 of the camera .",
    "these images were processed through the hst pipeline and mosaicked to produce the final images .",
    "a color composite of the f656n , f502n , and f547 m images is shown in figure 5 .",
    "n44c star 2 was identified as the primary source of ionizing photons for the nebula early on by @xcite , based on the stellar colors , o - type spectral features in the optical spectrum , and the fact that the he  ii 4686   nebular emission is centered on this star .",
    "another bright star some 8 arcsec south of star 2 , star 1 in @xcite , with magnitude v = 13.8 and color b - v = 1.06 @xcite , shows strong features of ca  i 4227  , the g - band of ch , and the mg  i b lines in our ctio spectrogram .",
    "these features clearly indicate that star 1 is a late - type star , most likely a foreground g or k star .",
    "our purpose in obtaining the ghrs spectrogram was to determine an accurate spectral type for star 2 and to look for spectral peculiarities .",
    "spectral typing of o stars embedded in bright nebulosity is sensitive to the subtraction of the strong , spatially variable h and he recombination lines from the nebula , and this is true for n44c .",
    "in contrast , the uv spectrum of o stars includes a number of spectral features which are sensitive to spectral type and luminosity @xcite , while nebular emission is largely absent in the uv .",
    "for example , the n  v 1240  , n  iv 1718  , and o  v 1371   features provide some discrimination between early- and late - type o stars , while the si  iv 1400   feature strongly discriminates between supergiants and dwarfs , developing a distinctive p cyg wind profile in o supergiants of type o4 and later .",
    "our ghrs spectrogram displayed in figure 2 shows features typically found in o stars , the most prominent of which include n v 1238,42 , c iv 1548 - 50 , si iv 1398 , 1420 , n iv 1718 , he ii 1640 , and o iv 1339,44 .",
    "the n v feature exhibits an unsaturated p cygni profile characteristic of a strong stellar wind , but except for a possible weak c iv feature , no other stellar feature has a p cyg profile at the limits of the signal / noise of the spectrogram .",
    "the spectrum also shows a number of strong , narrow interstellar absorption features .",
    "the most prominent is the saturated ly @xmath0 line ( with the geocoronal ly@xmath0 emission in the core ; note also that the ly@xmath0 absorption goes to zero , indicating that scattered light is absent ) .",
    "the centroid of the absorption line is offset from the geocoronal emission by about 250 km s@xmath5 , evidence that the bulk of the absorbing neutral hydrogen lies within the lmc .",
    "other prominent interstellar features include the s ii / c i blend at 1260  , o i + si ii near 1304  , c ii 1335  , si ii 1526  , and al ii 1670  .",
    "most of these lines show double profiles separated by approximately 230 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the low velocity component likely arises from foreground gas in the galaxy , while the higher velocity component arises from gas in the lmc .",
    "@xcite proposed that extreme o supergiants with @xmath14 @xmath15 50,000 k close to the eddington limit could produce sufficient numbers of he@xmath21-ionizing photons to account for nebular he  ii emission in some cases . on the other hand , nebular he",
    "ii recombination emission has not been seen associated with population i o3 stars in either the galaxy or the magellanic clouds .",
    "our ghrs spectrogram shows clearly that star 2 is not an early o supergiant .",
    "such stars in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds display saturated p cygni profiles for c  iv 1550   and n  v 1550  , as well as p cyg profiles for he  ii 1640   and n  iv 1718  . supergiants of type o4 and later also show p cyg profiles for si  iv 1400  .",
    "except for n  v , none of these lines shows a prominent p cyg profile in the spectrum of star 2 .",
    "in addition , neither our low - resolution optical spectrum nor a high - dispersion echelle spectrum ( kindly provided by k. venn and d. lennon ) for star 2 show the n  iv 4058   feature nor the n  v 4604 , 4620   lines observed in o3-o4 supergiants .    at the same time , the uv spectrum shows some evidence for peculiarities that confuse the spectral classification . comparing with the o5 v star sk70 69 and the o9 iii star av 238 ( figure 2 ) , we see that while n  v 1240   has a strength consistent with the earlier spectral type , the c  iv feature has a strength more similar to the later spectral type .",
    "the actual strength of the c  iv profile is difficult to determine because of the likely presence of superposed c  iv",
    "interstellar absorption from both the galaxy and the lmc .",
    "however , the stellar c  iv feature is noticeably weaker than observed in other o7 v stars @xcite ) .",
    "the strength of n  v and the weakness of c  iv suggest the possibility that star 2 is an on - type star @xcite . enhanced",
    "n and deficient c in the star would indicate that it is moderately evolved .",
    "a more detailed analysis is needed to determine if there are actual abundance anomalies in the star . nevertheless , it is clear that star 2 is an unlikely source for the photons capable of producing the nebular he  ii emission . on the basis of the uv spectrum",
    ", we estimate the spectral type of star 2 to be approximately o7 iii - v , consistent with that derived by @xcite from the optical spectrum .",
    "the composite wfpc2 image of the n44c region ( figure 5 ) shows three main features : ( 1 ) the high surface brightness , high - excitation ( [ o  iii ] 5007/h@xmath9 @xmath22 6 ) main body of n44c , which is mostly contained in chip wf2 ( upper left ) ; ( 2 ) diffuse , high - excitation filamentary emission to the sw of n44c ; and ( 3 ) low - excitation diffuse and dusty gas , seen mostly as h@xmath0 emission to the n and w of the bright  region .",
    "the bright main body of n44c has the appearance of a normal region , apart from its high excitation and he  ii emission .",
    "the e , ne , and nw boundaries of n44c are relatively sharp and have low [ o  iii]/h@xmath0 , indicating the presence of an ionization front .",
    "we infer that the nebula is bounded by a molecular cloud on these three sides .",
    "the low - excitation h@xmath0 emission to the n of the nebula , separated by a dust lane from n44c , is part of the superbubble surrounding the association lh 47 .",
    "the wfpc2 images shows star 2 to be single to the limits of the wfpc2 resolution , about 5000 au at a distance of 50 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with the normal appearance of the spectrum of star 2 .",
    "any companion must be much fainter than the o star , unless it is of the same spectral type .    a large region of diffuse filamentary gas",
    "is seen to the sw of n44c .",
    "these filaments appear to outline a roughly spherical cavity , and have [ o  iii]/h@xmath0 comparable to what is seen in n44c .",
    "the streamers running south from n44c may be part of this structure .",
    "it is clear that these streamers are foreground to n44c since they can be seen in dust absorption against the bright western part of the nebula .",
    "we therefore infer that the diffuse filamentary structure is physically unrelated to n44c",
    ". the structure may be a wind - blown bubble associated with the wolf - rayet star br 25 , which can be seen at the bottom of the pc frame in figure 5 .",
    "such bubbles are known to have high - excitation shells ( e.g. , ngc 2359 ; @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps more intriguing is the series of east - west oriented arcs located approximately 40@xmath18 - 50@xmath18 south of star 2 .",
    "the arcs are concave towards n44c , giving the impression of an expansion in that direction , possibly associated with a stellar outburst . our echelle spectrogram",
    "slit ( discussed below ) did not cross the arcs .",
    "however , the slit used by @xcite in their kinematic study did cross a part of these arcs . as discussed below , they saw little evidence for high - velocity gas in n44c , apart from the feature we now know to be he  ii 6560  . in the absence of stronger kinematic evidence , we speculate that the brightest arc represents an edge - on ionization front , isolated from the main nebula by a superposed dust lane and/or a shadow region .",
    "the pc frame shows a region of dusty material .",
    "this region is most likely associated with the star - forming complex n44b , which is located just outside the image to the nw ( upper right ) .",
    "this region shows extensive dust structures and also extensive nebular emission for which the ionizing sources are not obvious .",
    "infrared imaging of this region could reveal evidence of significant star formation activity .",
    "we measured the emission - line features in each spectrogram using the splot routine in iraf .",
    "line strengths relative to h@xmath9 were measured by integrating the fluxes under the emission - line profiles .",
    "the hydrogen balmer emission line strengths in the ctio spectrogram were corrected for stellar absorption by the ionizing star using an approximate spectral type of o7 , based on the initial inspection of the hst ghrs stellar spectrogram .",
    "this corresponds to an absorption equivalent width of 2.8    for the h@xmath9 line .",
    "certain features , such as [ ar  iv ] 4711   + he  i 4713  , are strongly blended . in such cases , we determined the relative fluxes for the individual lines by using the appropriate theoretical ratios for hydrogen and helium from @xcite .",
    "the measured fluxes for strong lines in the overlap region of the red and blue ctio spectra agreed to within 5% , so we averaged the measurements in the overlap region .",
    "upper limits for some undetected lines were determined from the rms noise in the local continuum .",
    "assuming an intrinsic h@xmath0/h@xmath9 ratio equal to 2.86 for @xmath23 = 10,000 k and @xmath24 = 100 @xmath25 , close to the derived physical conditions for n44c ( see below ) , we estimate that the interstellar reddening toward n44c corresponds to @xmath26 = 0.25@xmath270.05 magnitude , using a standard galactic extinction curve @xcite with @xmath28 = 3.1 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the foreground extinction toward the lmc of @xmath26 = 0.28 magnitude , based on the extinction maps of @xcite .",
    "the fact that we derive slightly smaller reddening may be attributed to uncertainties in the reddening measurement , and to patchiness in the foreground extinction which is not resolved by the large beam of the burstein & heiles maps .",
    "correcting the fos emission line measurements for interstellar reddening is less straightforward , as the uv reddening function can vary dramatically with environment @xcite . even within the lmc",
    "there is no ` standard ' uv reddening curve , as demonstrated by @xcite , who showed that the uv reddening curve differs for stars inside and outside the 30 doradus region .",
    "our fos spectrogram has a number of he  ii and he  i recombination lines ( in particular the bright he  ii 1640   line ) in the uv and visible spectral regions , which we could use to constrain the uv reddening curve .",
    "we compared the theoretical ratios for he ii lines with respect to he  ii 4686   and he i lines with respect to 4471  , along with the hydrogen balmer decrement , with reddening - corrected ratios based on the lmc reddening curves derived by @xcite and the standard galactic reddening curve with @xmath28 = 3.1 from @xcite .",
    "we found empirically that the average interstellar reddening curve for regions within 0.5 degrees of 30 dor derived by @xcite , with @xmath26 = 0.26@xmath270.05 mag , provided the best match to the relative strengths of the he  ii , he  i , and h i lines .",
    "the reddening - corrected line fluxes for the ctio spectrogram are listed in table 2 , while those for the fos spectrogram can be found in table 3 .",
    "the tabulated fluxes are normalized to the h@xmath9 flux in both tables .",
    "the tabulated uncertainties in the line fluxes were evaluated from the rms noise in the continuum near each emission line , combined with the uncertainty in the relative photometric calibration across the spectrum ( estimated to be approximately 3% based on standard stars ) and the uncertainty in the reddening correction .",
    "it is necessary to determine the electron temperature @xmath23 and electron density @xmath24 in the ionized gas in order to derive ionic abundances from the emission - line spectrum .",
    "a number of diagnostic emission line ratios are measureable in our spectra ( table 3 ) .",
    "we used an updated version of the lick observatory five - level atom program fivelev @xcite to derive the physical conditions from the diagnostic line ratios .",
    "the various diagnostic emission - line ratios and physical conditions derived from the line ratios are listed in table 5 .",
    "the [ s  ii ] line ratio integrated over the ctio spectrogram corresponds to @xmath24 in the low - density limit .",
    "however , the [ ar  iv ] line ratio in the ctio spectrogram and the [ s  ii ] and [ ar  iv ] ratios in the fos spectrogram yield a higher density of approximately 2000 @xmath25 in the high surface brightness region within 3@xmath18 of the ionizing star .",
    "thus , the bulk of the nebula , as sampled by the larger ctio slit , appears to consist of moderately low - density material , with the central he  ii - emitting region sampled by the fos aperture being the illuminated face of a molecular cloud in close vicinity to the ionizing star , similar to what is observed in the orion nebula @xcite .",
    "the higher density in this central region is still too low to have a significant effect on the abundances derived for the nebula .",
    "the various results for @xmath23 from [ o iii ] line ratios in table 3 agree to within measurement errors .",
    "a weighted mean of the three measurements yields @xmath23 = 11,200 @xmath27 200 k. we adopt this value for the ion abundance calculations to follow .",
    "a plot of the 5007 /4363   ratio along the ctio slit shows little variation other than noise , suggesting that the nebula is largely isothermal .",
    "the values of @xmath23 derived from the [ s  ii ] 4069 /6725   and [ o  ii ] 2470 /3727   ratios are somewhat smaller , approximately 9000 k ; the uncertainties are large , however , and the results are sensitive to the assumed electron density . the better measurement of [ o  ii ] 3727 /7325   yields a temperature much closer to the [ o  iii ] temperature .",
    "although photoionization models ( e.g. , @xcite ) predict that the electron temperature in the low - ionization zone ( including o@xmath21 , n@xmath21 , and s@xmath21 ) should be about 400 k cooler , we will treat the nebula as isothermal here . only a small error in the abundances derived here",
    "will be introduced by such an assumption , since the nebula is highly ionized . as is shown in the next section ,",
    "the ionic abundances determined from the ctio spectra and the fos spectra are in good agreement with each other , indicating that the isothermal assumption does not lead to very large errors .",
    "we adopt @xmath23 = 11,200 k and @xmath24 = 150 @xmath25 for the ctio observations , and @xmath23 = 11,200 k , @xmath24 = 1500 @xmath25 for the fos observations .",
    "we calculated ionic abundances relative to h@xmath21 from each spectrum separately using the five - level atom code , adopting the @xmath23 and @xmath24 values listed in the previous section .",
    "in general , the brightest or least density - sensitive measurable emission lines of each ion were used to determine the ionic abundances .",
    "the abundances for all ions observed in both spectra are listed in table 3 .",

    "we used @xmath24 = 150 @xmath25 to compute the he@xmath21 abundance ; at the higher density used for the fos measurements , we obtained larger differences between the he@xmath21 abundances derived from the 5876  , 4471  , and 6678    lines than when we use the lower density .",
    "the he@xmath21 abundance from the ctio data is a weighted mean of the values from the 4026 , 4471 , 5876 , and 6678   lines ; for the fos data , we used the weighted mean values from the 2945 , 3188 , 4471 , 5876 , and 6678   lines .",
    "for he@xmath7 , we used the 4686   line only .",
    "the ionic abundances determined from the two spectral datasets are in relatively good agreement , apart from differences that can be attributed to variations in ionization .",
    "the small he  ii - bright region observed within the fos aperture exhibits higher ionization than the larger region encompassed by the ctio slit , as reflected by the larger derived abundances for he@xmath7 and ar@xmath29 and the lower abundances for o@xmath21 , n@xmath21 , and s@xmath21 from the fos spectrogram .",
    "the o@xmath7 and ne@xmath7 abundances are roughly the same between the two spectra , but these two species would be expected to be partially replaced by o@xmath29 and ne@xmath29 in the he@xmath7 zone , so little variation would be expected .",
    "the total abundances for each element can be determined , in principle , by summing the contributions from each ionization state . for many of the elements we study here ,",
    "however , some important ionization states are not observed , or have poorly determined limits . to estimate corrections for unseen ionization states ,",
    "we have computed photoionization models using the code cloudy version 90.04 @xcite .",
    "first , we establish a few stellar and nebular properties .",
    "we estimated the total h- and he@xmath21-ionizing photon fluxes by determining the h@xmath9 and he  ii 4686   fluxes from our ctio images .",
    "we measured the counts in the h@xmath9 and he  ii 4686   images ( with stars subtracted ) within a 2@xmath18 strip centered on star 2 , corresponding to the slit used for the ctio spectra .",
    "the h@xmath9 and 4686   fluxes measured in our ctio spectrogram were used to determine the conversion from counts to flux in the images .",
    "we then measured total line fluxes for h@xmath9 and he  ii in the region encompassing the nebula from the images .",
    "the measured fluxes were f(h@xmath9 ) = ( 3.0@xmath270.6)@xmath1010@xmath30 erg @xmath31 s@xmath5 and f(4686 ) = 7.3@xmath1010@xmath32 erg @xmath31 s@xmath5 , after correcting for obscuration @xmath26 = 0.25 mag , corresponding to emission - line luminosities l(h@xmath9 ) @xmath6 9@xmath1010@xmath11 erg s@xmath5 and l(@xmath124686 ) @xmath6 2.2@xmath1010@xmath13 erg s@xmath5 at a distance of 50 kpc .",
    "for case b recombination , the derived h - ionizing photon luminosity is q(h@xmath33 ) = 1.9@xmath1010@xmath34 s@xmath5 and q(he@xmath21 ) = 2.3@xmath1010@xmath35 s@xmath5 .",
    "the values for l(@xmath124686)/l(h@xmath9 ) and q(he@xmath21)/q(h@xmath33 ) derived here for n44c are a factor of six smaller than those derived earlier by @xcite from published measurements .",
    "there are several possible reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "first , the line fluxes in @xcite were derived from the average surface brightnesses obtained from the small - aperture spectra of @xcite , multiplied by the estimated nebular area .",
    "these fluxes may have significant uncertainties due to the large geometric correction and the uncertainty in the average surface brightness .",
    "second , the he  ii flux derived from our ctio image may have a large uncertainty arising from the subtraction of the bright stars in the nebula .",
    "we estimate that our value for the @xmath36 he  ii line flux may be uncertain by @xmath2750% .",
    "third , it is possible that the he  ii flux may have experienced a significant decline between the 1986 observations and our 1991 observations ( see discussion below ) .",
    "following the example of @xcite for the orion nebula , we can estimate the distance from star 2 to the ionization front for our fos position from the nebular surface brightness and the derived q(h@xmath33 ) .",
    "we assume that the bulk of the h@xmath9 emission within the fos aperture arises from the surface of a molecular cloud on the far side of the star from us ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the h@xmath9 surface brightness within the fos aperture is 4.0@xmath1010@xmath37 erg @xmath31 s@xmath5 arcsec@xmath38 .",
    "if the nebula emits isotropically , this corresponds to 4@xmath39j @xmath6 0.02 erg @xmath31 s@xmath5 at the surface , or about 5.2@xmath1010@xmath40 h@xmath9 photons @xmath31 s@xmath5 . in",
    "case b recombination , approximately one out of every nine recombinations produces an h@xmath9 photon , so the recombination rate at the surface is approximately 4.5@xmath1010@xmath41 @xmath31 s@xmath5 . for an ionization - bounded nebula , the ionizing photon surface flux must be at least equal to the surface recombination rates .",
    "thus , for our derived q(h@xmath33 ) , the separation between star 2 and the ionized surface layer is about 1.8@xmath1010@xmath42 cm . in reality",
    ", photons reflected by the molecular cloud will contribute a small amount to the h@xmath9 flux , and grains will compete with h atoms for ionizing photons , which will lead to a somewhat smaller derived separation . for the purposes of our analysis , we will assume a star - gas separation of 10@xmath42 cm .",
    "ionizing stellar fluxes for the photoionization calculations were taken from the nlte stellar atmosphere models of @xcite .",
    "other more recently computed atmosphere flux models are available , but as we shall see below the corrections for unseen ionization states are small for most of the elements we observe , and the uncertainty in the ionizing radiation field is not critical to our estimates of element abundances in the case of n44c .",
    "we used average lmc element abundances from @xcite and @xcite , with refractory elements depleted by a factor of ten .",
    "orion - type grains were included with an abundance of 0.25 times the milky way value .",
    "model runs were computed for @xmath14 = 50,000 , 75,000 , and 85,000 k stellar atmospheres , and for ionization parameters log u = @xmath432.5 , @xmath433.0 , and @xmath433.5 . estimated total abundances for the elements observed in n44c are listed in table 6 .",
    "we discuss individual elements in detail below .",
    "computing the total helium abundance is trivial in principle , being the simple sum of the he@xmath21 and he@xmath7 abundances .",
    "simple photoionization models predict negligible neutral helium in the h@xmath21 zone for stars at least as hot as o7 .",
    "table 8 shows that he / h derived from the ctio and fos spectra disagree , with a 2.5@xmath1 difference between the two values .",
    "this is unlikely to be due to unaccounted observational errors .",
    "one possible explanation is that the adopted electron density for the fos observation may be too large .",
    "the he@xmath21 abundance is sensitive to the correction for collisional excitation .",
    "lowering the electron density would result in a higher he@xmath21 abundance .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that there is no evidence for he enrichment in n44c ; the ctio value is in good agreement with the average lmc he / h listed in @xcite .",
    "most of the oxygen in  regions is in the form o@xmath21 and o@xmath7 .",
    "however , in regions where he@xmath7 is present o@xmath29 is expected as well .",
    "our photoionization models indicate that the o@xmath29 fraction is tightly correlated with he@xmath7/he@xmath21 , and depends only weakly on the ionization parameter .",
    "the predicted corrections to the oxygen abundance are 2% and 14% for the ctio and fos spectra , respectively .",
    "these results are consistent with the corrections derived by the scheme listed in @xcite based on planetary nebula models ( 4% and 19% respectively ) .",
    "the values of o / h from the two spectra after these corrections agree to within 3% . the mean value , o",
    "/ h = 2.1@xmath1010@xmath44 , is consistent with the average o / h for lmc  regions @xcite .      our 2@xmath1 upper limit on the c  iv emission leads to a significant upper limit on the c@xmath29 fraction , less than 25% of the total c / h obtained from the fos observations .",
    "this is consistent with our photoionization models , which predict that c@xmath29/c@xmath7 @xmath6 0.1 - 0.2 for the observed he@xmath7 fraction .",
    "c@xmath8 contributes negligibly .",
    "we therefore adopt c / h = ( 7@xmath271)@xmath1010@xmath45 for n44c .",
    "this value is within 6% of the value derived for 30 doradus by @xcite .",
    "we thus find no evidence that carbon is enriched in n44c .",
    "the nitrogen abundance has the largest potential uncertainties , because only one ionization state , n@xmath21 , is observed directly .",
    "the large o@xmath7/o@xmath21 ratio in n44c tells us that n@xmath21 is only a minor fraction of the nitrogen abundance , and so a large ionization correction will be incurred .",
    "the analysis by @xcite suggested that , for metal - poor  regions ionized by stars hotter than 40,000 k , the n@xmath21/o@xmath21 ratio was a good approximation for n / o , to within 20% accuracy .",
    "the ionization models computed here confirm those results .",
    "we find from the models that ( 1 ) the ratio n@xmath21/o@xmath21 varies between 1.0 and 1.15 times n / o , with no systematic variation with o@xmath7/o@xmath21 ; and ( 2 ) the ratio ( n@xmath29 + n@xmath7)/n@xmath21 = o@xmath7/o@xmath21 to within a few percent over the entire range of ionization parameter and @xmath14 considered here . our 2@xmath1 upper limit on n@xmath7/h@xmath21 from the fos spectrum is consistent with these results , but is too large to provide a useful constraint .",
    "using these theoretical relations yields n / o = 0.05 for the ctio specturm and n / o = 0.08 for the fos spectrum . for the rest of our discussion",
    "we adopt the mean of the two results , log n / o = @xmath431.2@xmath270.1 , noting the potentially large uncertainty in the ionization correction .",
    "this value is 0.3 dex larger than the mean value for lmc  regions @xcite .",
    "thus there is some evidence for an nitrogen enrichment in n44c .",
    "the neon abundance can be derived straightforwardly from the sum of ne@xmath7 and ne@xmath29 from the fos spectrum , while the ar abundance is the sum of ar@xmath7 and ar@xmath29 in the ctio spectrum .",
    "the low upper limits on ne@xmath8 and ar@xmath8 indicate that these species contribute negligibly , and the ionization models concur that these two species are less than 2% of the total ne and ar abundances . the contributions from ne@xmath21 and ar@xmath21",
    "are predicted to be less than 10% of the total by the ionization models .",
    "the total ar / h abundance for n44c is within the range observed for ionized nebulae in the lmc and in other galaxies @xcite .",
    "the value log ar / o = 2.3 in n44c is also close to the mean value for the lmc .",
    "on the other hand , ne / o is about 0.2 dex higher than the mean for lmc  regions .",
    "we are puzzled as to the source of the high ne .",
    "we obtain a high ne abundance even if we consider only ne@xmath7 .",
    "one possible solution is if @xmath23 in the regions where ne@xmath7 and ne@xmath29 are produced is approximately 13,000 k , instead of the 11,400 k used here .",
    "this might be expected for such high - ionization species . on the other hand , @xmath23 for ne@xmath7",
    "is expected to be similar to that for o@xmath7 @xcite , and one might also expect to measure a higher @xmath23 in the fos data than in the ctio data , which is not observed .",
    "a higher @xmath23 in the high - ionization zone would also lead to a significant reduction in the ar abundance , leading to a discrepancy with the mean lmc abundance for that element .",
    "a measurement of the high - excitation [ ne  iv ] lines would provide a constraint on @xmath23 for the higher ionization states .",
    "we detect s@xmath21 and s@xmath7 in both our spectra . for a hot ionizing star ,",
    "significant amounts of s@xmath29 and s@xmath8 may also be present .",
    "our photoionization models predict that these two species should have abundances of 0.2@xmath270.1 times the s@xmath7 abundance in the ctio data and 0.35@xmath270.1 times the s@xmath7 abundance in the fos data . the resulting total s abundance for the two sets of observations are in excellent agreement .",
    "our derived values log s / h = 5.4@xmath270.1 and log s / o = 1.7@xmath270.1 are consistent with the mean value for lmc  regions .",

    "first , we assume that the x - ray emission can be approximated by a @xcite thin plasma model with a temperature @xmath15 10@xmath56 k. we then use the conversion from counts to energy given in the rosat mission description for a given temperature , assuming that the pspc count rate is three times that of the hri . assuming a distance of 50 kpc to the lmc and a count rate of 4.5x10@xmath44 counts s@xmath5 in the pspc , our computed 3@xmath1 upper limits on l@xmath55 are given in table 7 as a function of temperature and x - ray absorption n(h ) .",
    "we must now estimate the opacity to x - ray emission along the line of sight .",
    "this is typically expressed as a column density of h atoms along the line of sight ( n(h ) ) .",
    "note that in x - ray absorption models n(h ) is the x - ray absorption expressed in the units per h atom using opacities from @xcite .",
    "this absorption column density is not equal to the h  i column density because the absorption column density includes the ionized and molecular h as well .",
    "however , the h  i column density includes all h  i along the line of sight , while the absorption column density includes only the material between the object and us , so the h  i column density is commonly used to approximate the absorption column density .",
    "we will use this approximation as well .",
    "the h  i map of the n44c complex from @xcite indicates that the h  i column density toward n44c is only @xmath6 10@xmath57 @xmath31 .",
    "the analysis of asca data for n44 by @xcite indicates a similar value for n(h ) .",
    "finally , we note that the low interstellar obscuration suggests a relatively small column of absorbing material in front of the nebula .",
    "therefore , we are justified in assuming a absorption column density log n(h ) = 21.0 - 21.5 @xmath31 .    based on parameters adopted above and the results in table 7 ,",
    "we infer that the 3@xmath1 upper limit on l@xmath55 for any currently active point source with t @xmath15 10@xmath56 k in n44c is @xmath3 10@xmath4 ergs s@xmath5 in the rosat 0.1 - 2.0 kev band .",
    "this limit may be somewhat conservative because the assumed absorption column density is relatively high .",
    "note that a softer source could have a significantly larger luminosity and remain undetected . on the other hand ,",
    "our limit is an order of magnitude smaller than that inferred by @xcite , and is four orders of magnitude smaller than the luminosity of lmc x-1 , which powers an x - ray ionized nebula @xcite .",
    "our analysis of n44c still leaves us with a puzzle : where is the evidence for the source of the he@xmath21-ionizing photons that power the he  ii zone ?",
    "@xcite outlined several possible mechanisms which could account for the he  ii emission .",
    "the data presented here rule out virtually all of the proposed mechanisms .",
    "our ghrs spectrogram of star 2 shows it to be consistent with a main sequence dwarf star , and thus it is incapable of ionizing the he  ii zone according to state - of - the - art stellar atmosphere models .",
    "except for , possibly , nitrogen , the nebular abundances are consistent with average lmc values .",
    "evidence for a previous evolved companion star is thus largely absent .",
    "we see no evidence for high - velocity h@xmath0 anywhere in n44c , ruling out the possibility that a shock front produces the he  ii emission .",
    "the one possibility that remains open is the hypothesis by @xcite that n44c is a fossil x - ray - ionized nebula .",
    "they conjectured that n44c once contained an x - ray binary similar to lmc x-1 in which the x - ray emission had switched off some time within the recent past .",
    "noting the presence of he  ii emission and the absence of [ ne  v ] emission , they computed the recombination time scales for both species and estimated that the putative x - ray source would have had to shut off between 20 and 100 years prior to 1986 .    these estimates by pakull & motch were obtained assuming an electron density of 200 @xmath25 .",
    "however , we know from the present data that @xmath24 @xmath6 1000 - 2000 @xmath25 in the he  ii - emitting region of the nebula . at this density",
    "the recombination time - scales for he@xmath7 and ne@xmath8 are approximately 20 and 5 years , respectively . given that our ctio spectrogram was obtained in 1991 , this implies that the putative x - ray source shut down sometime between 1970 and 1978 ( when the @xmath58 observatory surveyed x - ray sources in the lmc ) .",
    "this is a very narrow window for the shut - off to occur .",
    "there is a further problem : the presence of considerable amounts of ne@xmath29 , which requires 63 ev photons to exist .",
    "the [ ne  iv ] 2420   line is strong and well - measured , as seen in figure 3 , so observational uncertainties are small . if the collision strength for this transition is greatly underestimated we would overestimate the ne@xmath29 abundance , but the abundance would still be significant if overestimated by a factor of ten .",
    "the radiative recombination coefficient for ne@xmath29 , 9.8@xmath1010@xmath59 @xmath60 s@xmath5 at t = 10,000 k @xcite , is even larger than that for ne@xmath8 , and we derive a recombination timescale of only about 3 yrs for ne@xmath29 .",
    "this analysis neglects dielectronic recombination , which has a much larger cross section than radiative recombination for ne@xmath29 and ne@xmath8 at nebular temperatures @xcite .",
    "thus , if the lack of [ ne  v ] emission is due to rapid recombination in a fossil x - ray - ionized nebula , we should not expect to see [ ne  iv ] emission either .",
    "what keeps the ne@xmath29 ionized ?",
    "nevertheless , as we noted earlier , the inferred l(@xmath124686 ) in our 1991 observations is much smaller than that inferred from the 1986 observations .",
    "this suggests that we are observing the recombination of he@xmath7 with time .",
    "in addition , the inferred q(h@xmath33 ) for star 2 from our data is much higher than that expected from an o7v star , suggesting that there may have been an additional source of ionizing photons . further spectral",
    "monitoring of n44c is warranted to confirm if the nebula is evolving as expected under the fossil nebula hypothesis .",
    "@xcite reported the detection by @xmath61 - 7 of a source , lmc x-5 , near the position of n44c , but the positional error circle ( @xmath60.3 degree ) was so large that a definitive identification can not be established .",
    "this source was detected significantly ( 4@xmath1 level ) only in the 3 - 10 kev band .",
    "@xcite claimed to have confirmed this detection with the @xmath62 observatory , but the positional uncertainty is much larger .",

    "no source was detected in our rosat hri observation in 1997 , nor in a shorter pointed hri observation in 1993 .",

    "another possibility is that an unseen compact companion may be in a highly eccentric orbit about star 2 .",
    "such a companion could trigger activity through accretion of material from the o star as the companion approaches periastron ; x - ray activity would then shut off as the companion moves outward on its orbit . a configuration such as this would have to be young enough that tidal forces have not significantly circularized the orbits .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the system is related to the be x - ray binaries @xcite , although star 2 itself does not currently show evidence of be activity .",
    "x - ray and optical spectral monitoring , and a radial velocity study , are needed to constrain the models for this system .",
    "we have presented new ctio and hst spectroscopy of the he  ii - emitting nebula lmc - n44c , a low - resolution uv spectrogram of its ionizing star , new nebular kinematic data , and deep high - resolution x - ray imaging of the nebula .",
    "we summarize our analysis here :    \\(1 ) the ghrs spectrogram of the ionizing star ( star 2 ) yields a spectral type of about o7 for the star .",
    "the si iv , he  ii , and c  iv features do not show p cygni profiles , showing definitively that the star is not a supergiant .",
    "no other stellar source is visible within 5000 au of the o7 star in wfpc2 images , nor is any close companion evident in the spectrum of the star .",
    "\\(2 ) the abundances of he , c , o , s , ar , and ne in the ionized gas are all consistent with average abundances for lmc h  ii regions .",
    "nitrogen may show an enhancement by about a factor of two , although the correction for unseen ionization states is large and uncertain .",
    "there is thus little evidence for enrichment by a previous evolved companion .",
    "\\(3 ) a long - slit echelle spectrogram in h@xmath0 + [ n  ii ] shows no signs of high - velocity gas ( @xmath15 100 km s@xmath5 ) in n44c . thus",
    ", high - velocity shocks do not account for the nebular he  ii emission .",
    "\\(5 ) based on new measurements of the electron density in the he  ii emitting region , we derive recombination timescales of @xmath6 20 yrs for he@xmath7 and @xmath6 4 yrs for ne@xmath8 , about a factor of five smaller than the values derived by @xcite .",
    "this places severe constraints on the time window within which a putative x - ray source could have turned off .",
    "an additional puzzle is why [ ne  iv ] emission is still observed in the nebula if the ionizing source has shut off .",
    "\\(6 ) x - ray monitoring and optical spectral monitoring of the nebula , and a radial velocity study of the ionizing star , are needed to fully understand the source of the hard ionizing photons that produced the he  ii and [ ne  iv ] emission in n44c .",
