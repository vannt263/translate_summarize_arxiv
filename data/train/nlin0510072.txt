    "the fit between the analysis and numerics is not as good for laser-1 . to achieve a better fit we need to derive a map that includes higher - order terms in @xmath13 , which we have not attempted",
    "for two coupled lasers we have studied the bifurcations that occur when the coupling constants are of opposite sign and unequal . specifically , the coupling is asymmetric in that we fix one coupling constant ( @xmath182 ) to be small , while varying the other ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "there are two hopf bifurcations to periodic output , one for @xmath181 positive and one for @xmath181 negative .",
    "we have focused our attention on the latter because of its similarity to our work with delay coupling in @xcite .",
    "when the output of laser-2 is nearly harmonic , the negative coupling effectively corresponds to phase shift by half of a period .",
    "this is equivalent to delayed coupling when the delay is half the period .    as @xmath41",

    "( i ) close to the hopf bifurcation a resonance can occur where the amplitude of the laser oscillations becomes large .",
    "this is unexpected because both coupling constants are still small .",
    "the resonance is due to the negative - coupling that effectively reduces the damping in the laser .",
    "( ii ) as the strength of the coupling increases further the periodic solutions may , depending on the parameters , exhibit a period - doubling sequence to chaos as well as the coexistence of subharmonic solutions .",
    "these effects are reminiscent of a periodically modulated laser . in the case of the coupled lasers",
    "the laser receiving the weak coupling remains a nearly harmonic oscillator that excites the strong resonances of the pulsating laser .",

    "that is , we used matched asymptotics to describe the pulsating laser-1 and to separate one period into an inner and outer subintervals .",

    "we obtain very good agreement between the amplitude of laser-2 and the overall period .",
    "the amplitude of the pulsations of laser-1 are not described quite as well .",

    "the large - amplitude solutions in the resonance peak just after the hopf bifurcation are not the same as those that appear due to a  singular - hopf bifurcation \" @xcite . in the latter case ,",

    "the first term in each integral is @xmath194 and because it does not involve the other laser is independent of the phase relationship between lasers @xmath12 and @xmath19 .",

    ", we obtain our final result for both solvability conditions : @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 where @xmath202 the inversion variable @xmath189 of each laser is a saw - toothed type function that increases linearly from the time of the previous pulse to the next .",

    "the intensity pulse depletes the inversion to @xmath205 , whereupon @xmath129 then increases linearly back to 0 .",
