    "cepheid variables are the most important distance indicators for calibrating the first rungs of the distance ladder , out to some 30 mpc . as young stars , cepheids tend to lie in dusty regions in their spiral or irregular parent galaxies .",
    "this implies that distance determinations using cepheids in the optical spectral range are very sensitive to an accurate knowledge of the total reddening , including the reddening produced inside the parent galaxy itself .",
    "consequently , efforts to use cepheids as distance indicators in near - infrared passbands have started as early as in the eighties of the past century with the pioneering work of mcgonegal et al .",
    "perhaps the most important obstacle to derive truly accurate distances to nearby galaxies from infrared photometry of their cepheids was the lack of well - calibrated fiducial period - luminosity ( pl ) relations in the near - infrared jhk bands .",
    "this long - standing problem was finally solved with the work of persson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who provided such fiducial pl relations in the lmc .",
    "very recently , gieren et al .",
    "( 2005a ) have also provided well - calibrated cepheid pl relations in jhk for the milky way , which are in very good agreement with the corresponding lmc relations when using an improved version of their original infrared surface brightness technique ( fouqu & gieren 1997 ; gieren , fouqu & gmez 1997 , 1998 ) employed for the distance determination of individual cepheids .    in the _ araucaria project _ , we have conducted optical ( bvi ) surveys for cepheid variables from wide - field images for a number of nearby galaxies in the local group , and in the more distant sculptor group .",
    "the main goal is to carry out a detailed investigation of the respective dependences on environmental properties of a number of stellar distance indicators , including cepheid variables , hereby improving the use of these objects as standard candles .",
    "while we discover the cepheids in optical bands where these stars are easy to find due to their relatively large light amplitudes and characteristic light curve shapes , the most accurate distance determinations come from near - infrared follow - up photometry of selected subsamples of cepheids , which allow a dramatic reduction of the systematic uncertainty of the distances due to reddening . our previous near - infrared work on cepheids in the araucaria project in ngc 300 ( gieren et al .",
    "2005b ) , ic 1613 ( pietrzyski et al . 2006 ) and ngc 3109 ( soszyski et al .",
    "2006 ) has already clearly demonstrated that errors in the adopted reddenings , which often neglect the contribution to the total reddening produced inside the host galaxies , is usually the largest single systematic error in cepheid distances to galaxies derived from optical photometry alone .",
    "near - infrared follow - up work is a _ must _ if one wants to push the distance uncertainties down to the @xmath13% level .    in the present paper",
    ", we are presenting near - infrared photometry in the j and k bands for 56 cepheid variables with periods between 124 and 1.7 days which are scattered across the entire surface of the local group irregular galaxy ngc 6822 .",
    "these variables were previously discovered from optical vi images by pietrzyski et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter paper i ) . at a galactic latitude of -18 degrees",
    ", there is substantial foreground reddening to ngc 6822 which implies that not only any intrinsic contribution to the reddening of the cepheids must be carefully determined for an accurate distance measurement , but that the foreground reddening may not be well determined either .",
    "we will show that as in our previous work on ngc 300 , ic 1613 and ngc 3109 , the combination of the new infrared photometry presented here with the previous optical photometry of the cepheids results in a very accurate determination of the total reddening , and of the distance to ngc 6822 , which will be extremely useful for the study of the environmental dependences of cepheids and other stellar distance indicators by comparative studies , which will be the subject of forthcoming papers in our project .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the observations , reduction and calibrations of our data ; in section 3 , we present the calibrated near - infrared mean magnitudes of the cepheids in our selected fields and determine the total reddening , and distance of ngc 6822 ; and in section 4 , we discuss our results and present some conclusions .",
    "the near - infrared data presented in this paper were collected with two instruments : the panic camera at the magellan - baade telescope at las campanas observatory , and the sofi camera at the eso ntt telescope on la silla .",
    "the field of view of the panic near - infrared camera is about 2 x 2 arcmin , and the pixel scale is 0.15 arcsec / pixel . the sofi infrared camera was used in its large field setup , with a field of view of 4.9 x 4.9 arcmin , and a scale of 0.288 arcsec / pixel .",
    "more details on these instruments can be found on the respective webpages .",
    "we observed a total of 8 different panic fields , and 6 sofi fields .",
    "the fields are overlapping and cover most of the spatial extent of ngc 6822 .",
    "the location of the different fields was chosen as to maximize the number of the ( relatively few ) long - period cepheids in the fields ; with our chosen field coordinates , we were able to obtain infrared photometry for 17 out of the 22 cepheids with periods longer than 10 days in the cepheid catalog we presented in paper i. fig .",
    "1 shows the location of our observed fields in ngc 6822 .",
    "single deep j and ks observations were obtained under good seeing conditions on 4 different nights at las campanas , and 2 nights on la silla .",
    "on two photometric nights , we observed a large number of photometric standard stars from the ukirt system ( hawarden et al .",
    "2001 ) . in order to account for the rapid sky brightness variations in the near - infrared ,",
    "the observations were performed with a jittering technique . in the ks filter",
    ", we obtained six consecutive 10 s integrations ( dits ) at a given sky position and then moved the telescope by about 20 arcsec to a different random position .",
    "integrations at 62 different jittering positions resulted in a total net exposure time of 62 minutes in this filter , for a given field . in the case of the j filter ,",
    "in which the sky level variations are less pronounced than in k , two consecutive 20 s exposures were obtained at each of 25 jittering positions , which resulted in a total net exposure of about 17 minutes , for any given field .",
    "sky subtraction was performed by using a two - step process employing the masking of stars with the xdimsum iraf package in an analogous manner as described in pietrzyski and gieren ( 2002 )",
    ". then the single images were flatfielded and stacked into the final images .",
    "psf photometry was obtained using daophot and allstar , following the procedure described in pietrzyski , gieren and udalski ( 2002 ) . in order to derive the aperture corrections for each frame ,",
    "about 7 - 10 relatively isolated and bright stars were selected , and all neighboring stars were removed using an iterative procedure . finally , we measured the aperture magnitudes for the selected stars with the daophot program using apertures of 16 pixels .",
    "the median from the differences between the aperture magnitudes obtained this way , and the corresponding psf magnitudes , averaged over all selected stars was finally adopted as the aperture correction for a given frame .",
    "the rms scatter from all measurements was always smaller than 0.02 mag .    in order to accurately transform our sofi data to the standard system , a large number ( between 8 and 15 ) of standard stars from the ukirt system ( hawarden et al .",
    "2001 ) was observed under photometric conditions at a variety of airmasses , together with our science fields .",
    "the standard stars were chosen to have colors bracketting the colors of the cepheids in ngc 6822 .",
    "the aperture photometry for our standard stars was performed with daophot using the same aperture as for the calculation of the aperture corrections .",
    "given the relatively large number of standard stars we observed on each night , the transformation coefficients were derived on every night .",
    "the accuracy of the zero points of our photometry was determined to be @xmath3 0.02 mag .",
    "the data obtained with the panic camera were transformed to the standard system using stars in common to the sofi fields .    since our science fields overlap ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , we were able to perform an internal check on our photometry by comparing the magnitudes of stars located in the common regions .",
    "in all cases , the independently calibrated magnitudes agree within 0.02 - 0.03 mag in both , j and k filters . for the relatively bright stars in our fields ,",
    "the magnitudes can be compared to the corresponding 2mass magnitudes .",
    "2 presents such a comparison in j and k for the common bright stars .",
    "before calculating the differences between our own , and the 2mass photometry , we transformed our photometry , which had been calibrated onto the ukirt system , to the 2mass system using the equations provided by carpenter ( 2001 ) .",
    "2 suggests that our magnitudes in both j and k are about 0.03 mag brighter than the corresponding 2mass magnitudes , but given the rather large scatter in the 2mass data for the fainter stars this offset does not seem significant . in any case , the comparison confirms our conclusion that our photometric zero points in j and k are accurate to at least 0.03 mag .",
    "the pixel positions of the stars were transformed to the equatorial coordinate system using the digital sky survey ( dss ) images .",
    "for this purpose , we used the algorithm developed and used in the ogle project ( udalski et al .",
    "the accuracy of our astrometric transformations is better than 0.3 arcsec .",
    "alltogether , our observed fields in ngc 6822 contain 56 cepheids bright enough to measure their near - infrared magnitudes . as we mentioned before , we chose our fields in such a way as to maximize the number of long - period cepheids in them , and we obtained photometry for 17 of the 22 cepheids with periods longer than 10 days in our previous catalog ( paper i ) .",
    "the faintest cepheids for which we could measure relatively accurate j and k magnitudes have periods around 4 - 5 days .    in table 1",
    ", we present the journal of individual observations of these 56 cepheid variables .",
    "the identifications are as in the catalog in paper i. nearly all of these objects have observations at more than one pulsation phase , and some of them have jk observations at four different phases in their light curves .",
    "the mean magnitudes of the cepheids were derived from each individual single - phase measurement from the template light curve method developed by our group ( soszyski et al .",
    "2005 ) which uses the v- and i - band phases of the individual near - ir observations , and the light curve amplitudes in v and i to calculate the differences of the individual single - phase magnitudes to the mean magnitudes in j and k. for a detailed description of the technique , the reader is referred to this paper in which we demonstrated that the mean k and j magnitudes of cepheids can be derived from just one single - phase infrared observation with an accuracy of 0.02 - 0.03 mag provided that high - quality optical light curves and periods are available for the variables , which is clearly the case in this study .",
    "obviously , the availability of more than one near - ir observation of a cepheid increases the accuracy of the determination of its mean near - ir magnitude because one can average the various independent determinations . in table 2 , we present the final intensity - mean jk magnitudes of our cepheid sample with their estimated uncertainties , which were determined from the photometric accuracies of the individual random - phase measurements of a given variable , and from the additional uncertainty introduced in the calculation of the mean magnitudes from the template method . in all cases where more than one near - ir observation for a given cepheid was available , the independent determinations of its mean magnitude agreed very well , typically within 1 - 3% , reconfirming the quality of our present near - infrared photometry as well as the accuracy of our previous vi light curves and periods given in paper i.      in fig .",
    "3 , we show the j- and k - band cepheid pl relations in ngc 6822 obtained from the mean magnitudes and periods in table 2 . our sample is seen to define the pl relations exceedingly well . we have adopted a period cutoff of 4.8 days in order to avoid any significant contamination of our sample with possible overtone pulsators which may appear in increasing numbers at shorter periods , and which could bias the distance determination . another reason to exclude stars with periods less than 4.8 days is the increasingly larger random errors in their photometry due to the increasing faintness of these objects . for the fits to a line , we decided to exclude four objects which are identified by open circles in fig .",
    "3 . as in our discussion in our previous optical work in paper i",
    ", we exclude the one cepheid with a period longer than 100 days , for the reasons given in that paper . the other 3 objects ( variables cep025 , 028 and 052 )",
    "are excluded on the basis of their large deviations from the mean j- and k - band pl relations defined by the remaining 33 stars .",
    "the same 3 cepheids deviate consistently in both bands , in the sense that their magnitudes are too bright for their periods , which suggests that these objects are blended with relatively bright nearby stars which are not resolved in our images .",
    "one of these objects , cep028 at logp=0.858 , is also clearly overluminous in the optical ( vi ) pl relations whereas cep025 and cep052 lie close to the ridge lines in the v- and i - band pl relations .",
    "this could indicate that for these two stars , the unresolved companions are very red and their contribution to the measured fluxes of the cepheids is only strongly noted in the near - infrared . for the adopted sample of 33 cepheids , the dispersions of the pl relations in both j and k around the ridge lines are so small that they basically reflect the intrinsic dispersions caused by the finite width of the cepheid instability strip ;",
    "this is suggested by a comparison of the present relations to the exceedingly well - determined near - infrared cepheid pl relations in the lmc of persson et al .",
    "finally , we also note that a possible contamination of our sample with first overtone pulsators is very unlikely , given that the shortest periods of about 5 days in our sample are too long for first overtone cepheids .",
    "least - squares fits to a line to our data for the adopted 33 cepheids in fig .",
    "3 yield slopes of the pl relations of -3.28 @xmath3 0.04 in k , and -3.23 @xmath3 0.05 in j , respectively .",
    "these values agree very well with the slopes for the cepheid pl relations in the lmc , which are -3.261 in k , and -3.153 in j ( persson et al .",
    "2004 ) , suggesting that the slope of the pl relation in the near - infrared domain remains unchanged when going from the lmc to the slightly more metal - poor ngc 6822 cepheids .",
    "this result is in line with the fact that the lmc slopes also yield very good fits to the cepheids in ic 1613 which are even more metal - poor than the cepheids in ngc 6822 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2006 ) . following the procedure we have adopted in our previous papers ,",
    "we adopt the lmc slopes of persson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in our fits .",
    "this yields the following pl relations for ngc 6822 : + j = -3.153 log p + ( 21.425 @xmath3 0.025 ) + k = -3.261 log p + ( 20.999 @xmath3 0.021 ) + these relations are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that they fit the data extremely well . before calculating the relative distance of ngc 6822 with respect to the lmc from the zero points in these relations",
    ", we need to convert our zero point magnitudes which are calibrated onto the ukirt system , to the nicmos system on which the corresponding lmc zero points were calibrated ( persson et al .",
    "according to hawarden et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , there are just zero point offsets between the ukirt and nicmos systems ( e.g. no color dependences ) in the j and k filters , which amount to 0.034 and 0.015 mag , respectively . after adding these offsets , and assuming an lmc true distance modulus of 18.50 as in our previous work in the araucaria project , we derive distance moduli for ngc 6822 of 23.586 mag in the j band , and 23.463 in the k band .",
    "values for the distance modulus of 24.458 in v , and 24.025 in i had been found in our previous optical work in paper i.    as in our previous papers in this series ( gieren et al . 2005b ; pietrzyski et al .",
    "2006 ) , we adopt the extinction law of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and fit a straight line to the relation @xmath4 .",
    "the best least squares fit to this relation yields for the reddening , and the true distance modulus of ngc 6822 the following values : + @xmath0    @xmath5    in table 3 we give the adopted values of @xmath6 and the unreddened distance moduli in each band which are obtained with the reddening determined in our multi - wavelength approach .",
    "the agreement between the unreddened distance moduli in each band is excellent . in fig .",
    "4 , we show the apparent distance moduli in vijk as a function of @xmath6 , and the best fit to the data ; it is appreciated that the total reddening , and the true distance modulus of ngc 6822 are indeed very well determined from this fit .",
    "comparison of our reddening value to the foreground reddening to ngc 6822 of 0.236 demonstrates that there is indeed a significant contribution to the total reddening of the cepheids which is produced by dust extinction in the galaxy itself , in agreement with what we found for ngc 300 and ic 1613 in the earlier papers in this series . in the case of ngc 6822",
    ", our data suggest that the reddening produced internal to the galaxy is 0.12 mag .",
    "in the following , we will discuss the various assumptions we made , and possible systematic errors which could affect our distance determination of ngc 6822 .",
    "the probably largest single systematic uncertainty on the derived distance modulus of ngc 6822 comes from the current uncertainty on the adopted distance modulus for the lmc .",
    "this problem has been extensively discussed in the recent literature ( e.g. benedict et al .",
    "2002 ) , and we will not add on this discussion here .",
    "we just note that our adopted value of 18.50 for the lmc distance is in agreement with the value adopted by the key project of freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and since all the cepheid distances obtained for the different target galaxies in our project are tied to the same lmc distance , the _ relative _ distances between our target galaxies are not affected .    in a recent paper which presented our near - infrared cepheid photometry for another local group irregular galaxy , ic 1613 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2006 ) , we discussed in some detail why our distance results derived from our current multi - wavelength approach are little affected by the choice of the fiducial pl relations in the lmc .",
    "the persson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) jk cepheid pl relations we have used in this work are clearly extremely well established , at least for periods longer than 10 days .",
    "the persson et al .",
    "sample does not contain , however , many cepheids with shorter periods , so a possible break in the pl relation at 10 days as advocated by kanbur and ngeow ( 2004 ) , and ngeow et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , would not be easily detected .",
    "our previous results in the araucaria project on ngc 300 whose cepheids have on average lmc metallicity ( urbaneja et al . 2005 ) , and on the much more metal - poor ic 1613 galaxy ( pietrzynski et al .",
    "2006 ) have shown that within very small uncertainties the pl relation in j and k seems universal in the metallicity range from about -0.3 to -1.0 dex .",
    "any concerns about the universality of the pl relation , as advocated by sandage et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and ngeow and kanbur ( 2004 ) , seem to refer to the metallicity range between solar and lmc abundance . while he former studies find a steeper slope for the milky way pl relation than for the lmc , in agreement with the work of fouque et al .",
    "( 2003 ) from the infrared surface brightness technique , there is now recent evidence that the milky way pl relation actually agrees in slope with the lmc relation when a systematic error in the surface brightness technique is corrected ( gieren et al . 2005a ) .",
    "clearly , the question of the universality of the pl relation , particularly in the range between solar and lmc metallicity , has to be further investigated to obtain a clear - cut and convincing result , and this is one of the main purposes of our project . regarding the possible break of the pl relation at 10 days discussed by sandage et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and more recently by ngeow et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we clearly have not seen such an effect in the data for any of the galaxies we have so far studied in the araucaria project ; the effect , if real , must be very subtle , and indeed ngeow et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have estimated that its effect on distance determinations with the pl relation should be less than 3% , and therefore not a cause of serious concern as long as we do not strive for distance accuracies of 1% , which seem out of reach for non - geometrical methods at the present time .    as in the previous papers in this series on ngc 300 ( gieren et al .",
    "2005b ) , ic 1613 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2006 ) , and very recently ngc 3109 ( soszyski et al . 2006 ) , we were able to measure very accurate mean jk magnitudes for a very sizable sample of cepheids in ngc 6822 which cover a broad range in periods , and establish a final sample of variables which is very unlikely to be affected by the presence of overtone pulsators , or heavily blended stars which could seriously bias our determination of the zero points of the pl relations in the j and k bands . regarding the possible effect of blending , viz .",
    "of the effect of nearby companion stars to the cepheids which are not resolved in our photometry , we have shown in the case of the more distant ngc 300 from _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "images that the effect on the distance determination does not exceed 2% ( bresolin et al . 2005 ) . in the present case of ngc 6822",
    "the effect is expected to be smaller because the galaxy is about 4 times closer than ngc 300 , and has a smaller average stellar density .",
    "in addition , heavily blended cepheids can be rather easily recognized , and eliminated from the sample used for the distance determination ( as we did in this study ) from their observed positions on the pl planes _ if _ the observational scatter is low , as a consequence of using photometric data of high quality .",
    "this is certainly the case for the present data , and we already remarked before that the dispersion in fig .",
    "3 is so small that it approaches the _ intrinsic _ dispersion expected from the finite width of the cepheid instability strip , with only a small additional contribution from photometric errors which is mostly visible at the shortest periods in fig .",
    "this eliminates any concern that blending could bias our present distance determination by more than 2% .",
    "also , the relatively large size of our sample eliminates concerns about the effect of incomplete filling of the instability strip ( see also the discussion in pietrzyski et al . 2006 , and our previous paper presenting the optical photometry of the ngc 6822 cepheids ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2004 ) ) .    as we have shown in our previous papers in this series , the most important source of uncertainty in cepheid - based distance determinations of nearby , resolved galaxies from optical photometric data alone",
    "is the interstellar reddening . in",
    "both ngc 300 and ic 1613 we found from our infrared studies that there is a very significant _ intrinsic _ contribution to the reddening , in addition to the galactic foreground reddening in the directions to these galaxies .",
    "the most important gain in extending the cepheid observations to the infrared is the possibility to determine the total reddening very accurately , as again demonstrated in this paper , for the case of ngc 6822 .",
    "our definitive distance determination of ngc 6822 from cepheids presented in this paper agrees very closely with our previous , preliminary result from vi photometry presented in paper i because we had happened to use the correct reddening value in that paper .",
    "the agreement of the reddening of ngc 6822 derived from cepheid h - band photometry by mcgonegal et al .",
    "( 1983 ) with our present value from vijk photometry of cepheids confirms the excellent pioneering infrared work done by these authors more than 20 years ago .    as a result of this discussion , and those presented in our previous papers in this series ,",
    "we conclude that the total effect of systematic errors due to the fiducial pl relations we use , possible incomplete filling of the instability strip and contamination of our cepheid samples with overtone pulsators , and blending with unresolved companion stars in our photometry does not exceed @xmath13% .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of our adopted photometric zero points , which propagates directly into the distance determination , is in the order of 0.03 mag , or @xmath31.5% , in all bands .",
    "random errors due to photometric noise are clearly less important in the present case and do not contribute significantly to the error budget .",
    "we therefore conclude that the present distance determination to ngc 6822 from our combined optical and near - infrared photometry of cepheids in this galaxy is accurate , including systematics , to about @xmath33 percent .",
    "we stress , however , that this value does not include the contribution from the current uncertainty of the lmc distance , which could be as large as 10% . for the immediate purposes of the araucaria project , however , _ relative _ distances are essential , and we have now another galaxy whose distance relative to the lmc appears to be determined with the same high accuracy of about @xmath33% as for the other galaxies for which we have used cepheid infrared photometry for distance determination , viz .",
    "ngc 300 , ic 1613 and ngc 3109 .",
    "finally , we note that our present distance result of 23.31 @xmath3 0.02 ( random ) @xmath3@xmath10.06 ( systematic ) based on cepheid variables agrees very well with the recent distance determination of cioni & habing ( 2005 ) who obtained a true distance modulus of 23.34 @xmath3 0.12 mag for ngc 6822 from the observed i - band magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "it also agrees reasonably well with the former cepheid near - infrared distance to ngc 6822 of @xmath7 derived by mcgonegal et al .",
    "( 1983 ) using the same reddening as the one we found in this paper , from random - phase h - band photometry of 9 cepheids which was not corrected to the mean magnitudes as in our present work .",
    "this fact alone , combined with the small number of cepheids they used in their pl solution may easily explain the 0.16 mag deviation of their value from ours .",

    "<S> we have measured near - infrared magnitudes in the j and k bands for 56 cepheid variables in the local group galaxy ngc 6822 with well - determined periods and optical light curves in the v and i bands . using the template light curve approach of soszyski , gieren and pietrzyski , accurate mean magnitudes were obtained from these data which allowed us to determine with unprecedented accuracy the distance to ngc 6822 from a multi - wavelength period - luminosity solution in the vijk bands . from our data , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a distance to ngc 6822 of @xmath0 ( random error ) mag , with an additional systematic uncertainty of @xmath13% . </S>",
    "<S> this distance value is tied to an assumed lmc distance modulus of 18.50 . from our multiwavelength approach </S>",
    "<S> , we find for the total ( average ) reddening to the ngc 6822 cepheids @xmath2 mag , which is in excellent agreement with a previous determination of mcgonegal et al . from near - infrared photometry and implies significant internal reddening of the cepheids in ngc 6822 . </S>",
    "<S> our present , definitive distance determination of ngc 6822 from cepheids agrees within 2% with the previous distance we had derived from optical photometry alone , but has significantly reduced error bars .    </S>",
    "<S> our cepheid distance to ngc 6822 is in excellent agreement with the recent independent determination of cioni & habing from the i - band magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch . </S>",
    "<S> it also agrees well , within the errors , with the early determination of mcgonegal et al . </S>",
