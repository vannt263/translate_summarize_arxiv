    "the spectroscopic detection of an energetic supernova ( sn2003dh ) concurrent with grb  030329 ( hjorth  2003a ; stanek  2003 ) has firmly established that long - duration ( @xmath2  s ; kouveliotou 1993 ) grbs accompany the core - collapse of some class of massive stars .    since",
    "massive stars are short - lived , this also confirms that grbs are closely associated with star formation activity ; a possibility already discussed by a number of authors ( eg . wijers  1998 ; totani 1999 ; blain and natarajan 2000 ) .",
    "the extreme luminosity of the prompt gamma - ray emission means that grbs can be detected , if they exist , to very high redshifts , with minimal extinction by intervening gas or dust .",
    "this makes them potentially very powerful indicators of star formation to early times .    to date",
    ", spectroscopically - confirmed redshifts have only been published for about three dozen bursts , although various schemes have been suggested to derive redshifts empirically from @xmath3-ray properties ; such as the lag - luminosity ( norris  2000 ) and variability - luminosity relations ( reichart  2001 ) .",
    "these studies suggest that the redshift distribution of grbs is broadly consistent with the emerging picture of the comoving star formation rate in the universe having peaked sometime around redshifts 1 - 4 , although uncertainties ramp up at higher redshifts .",
    "( eg . ramirez - ruiz , trentham and blain 2002 ; lloyd - ronning  2002 )    these results are interesting , but premature to the extent that we have limited knowledge of these luminosity correlations , and only rudimentary understanding of the relationship between grb rate and star formation rate ( eg .",
    "krumholz  1998 ) .",
    "for instance , there is the possibility that grb rate and/or brightness depends also on other factors , such as metallicity , galactic environment , and certainly on any variations in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "these are difficult factors to disentangle , but important insights can be gained by comparing grb rate with the star formation rate estimated by other means .",
    "our program is aimed at providing a more quantitative comparison of the star formation rate deduced by grbs and that obtained from submm luminosity , through direct study of the host galaxies of grbs .",
    "existing methods of mapping the star formation history of the universe rely on estimating the star formation rates of individual galaxies , and summing these up in redshift bins with some estimated correction for galaxies below the detection threshold ( eg .",
    "adelberger & steidel 2000 ) , or by modelling the redshift distribution so as to fit integrated backgrounds ( eg .",
    "blain 1999a ) .",
    "if grbs reliably trace star formation , and we can quantify the relationship , then ultimately detection of their host galaxies will not be required for the purposes of mapping global star formation history .",
    "nonetheless , grb hosts also uniquely allow us to study the star - forming galaxy luminosity function right to the faint end .",
    "an upshot may be a means to estimate the proportion of the total star formation which is going on in ir - bright , dusty galaxies , optically - bright galaxies and in fainter populations which are not selected in other surveys ( eg .",
    "trentham  2002 ) . to date , the best example of the power of grb selection to probe the faintest end of the galaxy luminosity function is grb  020124 , whose host galaxy is undetected by _",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ to @xmath4 ( berger  2002 ) .",
    "this galaxy would not have been found in any direct imaging survey to date and yet observations of the afterglow show that the host has a high hi column density ( making it a damped ly@xmath5 absorber ) and a redshift of @xmath6 ( hjorth  2003b ) .",
    "the power of submm studies for mapping the star formation history of the universe is discussed in detail by blain  ( 2002 ) and smail  ( 2002 ) .",
    "briefly , in dusty systems uv radiation , predominantly from massive stars , is reprocessed by the dust and emitted in the far ir .",
    "this emission , which itself is unaffected by dust extinction , is thus proportional to the obscured star formation rate . at higher redshifts",
    "the peak of emission moves increasingly into the submm , with the beneficial consequence that at 850  the apparent luminosity of a galaxy of given intrinsic bolometric luminosity changes little from redshift @xmath7 out to @xmath8 .",
    "submm surveys , combined with constraints from the intensity and spectrum of ir backgrounds , show that compared to the local universe , the majority of high redshift star formation appears to be taking place in dusty systems ( blain  1999a ) , and much ( although not the dominant part ) of this in so - called ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs : with ir luminosities @xmath9 ) .",
    "low redshift ulirgs exist , but have around 1000 times lower comoving space density ( smail  2002 ) .",
    "potential drawbacks with submm surveys are : ( a ) at the 2  mjy confusion limit of scuba only about 30% of the total submm background emission from _",
    "cobe_-firas observations is resolved out ; ( b ) any individual galaxy may suffer some contamination of its 850  luminosity through heating from an obscured agn . only about 10% of submm galaxies with deep x - ray data appear to show evidence for a hard x - ray agn (",
    "almaini  2003 ) , but larger samples and deeper observations will be necessary to confirm this fraction ; ( c ) it is necessary to assume or constrain the shape of the far - ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at wavelengths shorter than 850   in order to translate the measured submm flux density into an accurate luminosity and star formation rate .",
    "the luminosity inferred from a galaxy with a certain sed depends only weakly on redshift ; however , without direct knowledge of the details of the sed this luminosity is uncertain , leading to ambiguity in the results .",
    "a certain fractional change in the dust temperature leads to a fractional uncertainty in the inferred luminosity that is greater by several times ( blain  2002 ; blain , barnard and chapman 2003 ) .",
    "while results are so far generally consistent with dust temperatures of order 35k ( chapman 2003a ) , the extent of the distribution of values is not yet known .",
    "redshifts for large samples of submm galaxies were for a long time hard to obtain , because of the lack of both bright optical counterparts ( frequently @xmath10 ) , and the poor 15  arcsec spatial resolution of scuba at 850 . however , chapman et al .",
    "( 2003b ; see also ivison  2002 ) have demonstrated that about 65% of submm galaxies",
    "brighter than 5mjy are detected in very deep vla radio maps , providing accurate subarcsec positions .",
    "redshifts for around 4050% of these radio - detected submm galaxies can be obtained using keck lris spectra ( chapman  2003a ) .",
    "based on these results they find a range of redshifts from 0.8 to 2.8 with a median of 2.4 , and conclude it is likely that most submm galaxies lie at redshifts between 2 and 3 . the radio selection could be biased to lower redshifts , and to sources containing agn ; however , the reasonable @xmath11% completeness of chapman s redshift determinations suggests that these effects are not too significant .    on the other hand , in a recent study of the evolution of the global stellar mass density @xmath12 based on an infrared - selected sample of galaxies from the hubble deep field north , dickinson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) report that while the star formation rate essentially tracks that determined in other wave - bands at low redshifts , the rate at @xmath13 is significantly different .",
    "these observations appear to be inconsistent with scenarios in which the bulk of stars in present - day galactic spheroids formed at @xmath14 , since most of the stars ( 50  75% ) of the present day stellar mass density formed by @xmath15 and in fact by @xmath16 only 3  14% of today s stars were present .",
    "the issue is clearly not settled .",
    "current sensitivities and confusion limits imply that substantially fainter submm samples will not be studied in detail until the alma interferometer is commissioned in 2012 .",
    "hence , an alternative method to probe the star formation in obscured galaxies is definitely required , and grb source counts and host galaxy studies may ultimately be able to tell us both when and where this star formation occured .      several characteristics of grbs lend them to probing high redshift star formation : ( a ) they are bright enough to be seen to @xmath17 ( eg .",
    "lamb & reichart 2000 ) ; ( b ) they can be detected in @xmath3-rays through large columns of dust and gas ; ( c ) they can be detected independently of whether a host galaxy can be found .",
    "furthermore , much information relating to the host , such as redshift , metallicity , gas column density and extinction can all be obtained indirectly , from afterglow observations ",
    "either optically or x - ray ; ( d ) the spectral slopes of both prompt and afterglow emission compensate to some extent for redshift dimming , and time - dilation means that observations can be made earlier in the rest - frame time than would be the case for lower redshifts ; ( e ) being produced by individual massive stars , they are obviously unaffected by agn contamination .    on the downside , grbs are rare , their progenitors are still not fully understood and they are not very useful for telling us about the star formation rate in individual galaxies . in terms of the current observational state - of - play , samples of grbs , particularly those with firm redshifts are very inhomogeneous  the result of a wide variety of triggers and followup campaigns .",
    "one consequence is that , of the roughly 200 entries to - date in jochen greiner s web tablejcg / grbgen.html ] of `` well - localised '' bursts , fewer than 25% have optical afterglows identified .",
    "however , only a minority of those 200 were reported within 24 hours , and had error circles @xmath18  arcmin in diameter . also ,",
    "many were not well placed for optical observation , have only shallow limits , or in some cases no reported optical followup at all .",
    "thus , the superficially high rate of `` dark '' grbs is misleading .",
    "the proportion of genuinely dark grbs ( a reasonable working definition would be @xmath19 at 24 hours post - burst ; see also section 2 ) amongst the _ hete _ and _ bepposax _ triggers is probably only 1030% .",
    "the wide variation in grb followup campaigns makes it hard to quantify selection effects , but selection effects may well be important for our study . to be found optically",
    ", an afterglow should not be in too dusty an environment .",
    "a low redshift illustration of this issue is provided by mannucci  ( 2003 ) , who find an enhanced core - collapse supernova rate in k - band monitoring of nearby star - forming galaxies , but still conclude that the large majority of supernovae remain undetected due to very high extinction .",
    "in fact , for grbs this conclusion is not as inevitable as it sounds because the initial flux of high energy photons from grbs is expected to destroy dust possibly up to @xmath20  pc ( eg . fruchter  2001c ; galama and wijers 2001 ) . in some cases this will be enough to create a window through otherwise obscuring dust clouds .",
    "of course , if most star formation in the universe is occuring in the `` obscured mode '' , then dust destruction may actually be a _ requirement _ to explain the large number of afterglows detected optically . even when optical afterglows are not found to faint limits , as we shall argue below , it is not necessarily the case that they are heavily enshrouded in dust . nonetheless , it would be surprising if some fraction of grb afterglows were not missed because they were highly extinguished .",
    "detected afterglows are unlikely to be found in very low - density environments , even if grbs occur there , since the brightness of the spectral peak reduces with the density of the ambient medium ( sari  1998 ) .",
    "the high hi column densities seen towards many bursts ( eg .",
    "galama & wijers 2001 ; hjorth  2003b ) are consistent with this expectation , although reichart & price ( 2002 ) suggest that for the limited sample of dark bursts available , the column densities are not consistent with them being in the nuclear regions of ulirgs either .",
    "observational limitations are also likely to introduce a bias against finding high redshift grbs .",
    "although the spectral slope and cosmological time - dilation work so as to reduce the effect of redshift on the magnitude of an afterglow at a given observer time after the burst ( another kind of negative @xmath21-correction ) , grbs of comparable intrinsic luminosity will still appear fainter at higher redshift , making them and their afterglows harder to discover . for example , hogg and fruchter ( 1999 ) adopted a @xmath22 dependence for the probability that a burst at a given redshift is detected and an optical afterglow found .",
    "of course , @xmath23 objects will be essentially invisible in the optical due to the ly@xmath5 break .",
    "our initial goal is to compare the submm properties of grb hosts with model predictions and hence provide a consistency check on both techniques for tracing star formation .",
    "ultimately we d like to understand the quantitative relation between grb rate and star formation rate , so that larger samples of grbs may be used to give a good description of the global star formation history of the universe .",
    "the first submm limits and detections of grb host galaxies came from observations aimed at detecting grb afterglows . only in a couple of cases were such fading afterglows detected , but grb  010222 was found to be a steady source , suggesting the flux was dominated by emission from a bright host galaxy ( frail  2002 ) .",
    "useful upper limits were also obtained for a number of other hosts ( smith  1999 ; galama  1999 ; kulkarni  1999b ; smith  2001 ) .",
    "it is possible to average a number of non - detections providing systematic uncertainties are small , to find the average flux density for a whole sample .",
    "unfortunately in the case of the afterglow observations , since there may well be some small afterglow contribution to each observation , even if it is not detected significantly in individual cases , this averaging procedure is best avoided . for the data discussed here the observations",
    "were generally made long after the afterglow should have faded .",
    "an obvious concern , already raised in section 1.3 , is that those grbs with optically detected afterglows may be biased against residing in dusty hosts , the very galaxies which would on average be submm bright . in an effort to assess whether such a bias exists ,",
    "barnard  ( 2003 ; hereafter paper 1 ) observed a small sample of `` dark '' grbs with deep limits on any optical afterglow but with good radio and/or x - ray positions .",
    "the expection at the outset was that compared to the hosts of optically - bright grbs , these would be more likely to be dusty , massive star - forming galaxies .",
    "in fact , this sample of 4 produced only 1 individually significant detection , and no overall excess of 850  emission over that predicted by ramirez - ruiz , trentham & blain ( 2002 ) for all hosts .",
    "these results appear to argue against dark bursts being preferentially found in dusty hosts .",
    "however , this is only a small sample , and in paper 1 we also remarked that there was some evidence from the rapid decay of the radio afterglows that two of the bursts in submm - faint hosts could have been dark due to intrinsic optical faintness , rather than extinction .",
    "in fact , it is becoming clearer that there is a broad range in brightness of optical afterglows and a number of detected bursts would have been missed in most afterglow searches . for example , grb  980613 , grb  000630 and grb  021211 ( hjorth  2002 ; fynbo  2001 , fox  2003 ) were all around @xmath24 at 1 day , and , although the sample of bursts studied in paper 1 were fainter than all these , the upper limits do not require them to have been much fainter .",
    "similarly , grb  020124 had a relatively typical intrinsic magnitude , but appeared faint because of its redshift of @xmath25 ( hjorth  2003b ) . in any event",
    ", as we see below , even the modest rate of submm detections for dark burst hosts found in paper 1 appears to be somewhat greater than the rate which is now found for hosts of optically detected bursts .",
    "recently berger  ( 2003 ; hereafter be03 ) published scuba 850  measures for a larger sample of 13 grb hosts , in addition to radio observations for many .",
    "below we present our results for another sample of hosts ( which partially overlaps with be03 ) , and combine and analyse all the extant data .",
    "we have obtained further submm photometry of the host galaxies of optically identified grbs , using the sub - millimetre common user bollometer array ( scuba ) instrument on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "the targets were chosen to be well placed for observation from mauna kea , and have sub - arcsec positions from their optical afterglows .",
    "all observations were made at least 12 weeks after the burst ( and usually much longer ) , and are therefore very unlikely to be contaminated with afterglow emission .",
    "observations and reduction were performed as described in paper 1 .",
    "the log and results are detailed in table 1 ; note that some were reported by barnard ( 2002 ) .",
    "of the galaxies presented here and in paper 1 , seven are in common with be03 .",
    "this is useful to improve the measurement uncertainties , and also to check for statistical consistency , since the methods of reduction differ somewhat .",
    "overall , we are reassured to find no significant systematic difference between the two data sets . the galaxy to galaxy scatter is , however , a little larger than expected from the quoted errors .",
    "specifically , 4 of the 7 disagree by more than @xmath26 , which could happen by chance , but it leads us to suspect that the uncertainties found by one or both groups are marginally underestimated .    .",
    "850photometry observations of a new sample of grb hosts , chosen on the basis of good positions easily observable from mauna kea .",
    "note the varying number of integrations per target  the quoted flux densities are error - weighted averages of the measurements for each source .",
    "the @xmath27 measures the sky opacity during the observations .",
    "as can be seen , we do not enforce positivity on the submm fluxes , so as not to bias any subsequent statistical analysis . in a few cases the uncertainties are still large , and the data of limited use , but we report them here for completeness . [ cols=\"<,^,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the combined sample contains 21 host galaxies which have 850   measures with better than 1.4  mjy uncertainties , indeed most of these have errors @xmath28 1  mjy .",
    "our discussion refers mainly to this well - observed sample .",
    "only three galaxies have significant positive detections , namely the hosts of grb  010222 , grb  000418 and grb  000210 , which are all found at @xmath29 , and so can be regarded as confident detections .",
    "a few others have @xmath30 detections , but we should be more wary of these , particularly since there are also a couple of cases of @xmath30 negative fluxes .",
    "this latter fact could be taken as a further hint of a small underestimate in the errors , but equally it could be a chance occurence given the sample size and the fact that the quoted errors do not account for crowding noise .",
    "for reasonable dust temperatures of order 40k , corresponding to restframe far - ir seds peaking at about 90@xmath31 m , the luminosities of these galaxies would be about @xmath32l@xmath33 .",
    "if all this energy was provided by star formation , then a star formation rate upward of 1000m@xmath33yr@xmath34 would be required ( eg .",
    "blain , barnard and chapman 2003 ) .",
    "two hosts previously identified as possibly highly star forming are grb  980703 and grb  000911 , on the basis of radio flux ( berger  2001b ) and submm ( be03 ) respectively .",
    "our compilation suggests that in both instances , these initial results were overestimates  in the former case , plausibly due to the scatter in the fir - radio correlation . in the case of grb  000911 , the conclusion proceeds from the low flux seen in the afterglow observations of smith  ( 2001 ) . as a general point",
    ", we note that when working at the limit of detection , since there are many more low luminosity galaxies than high luminosity , the fluxes of the brightest galaxies in any sample are more likely to be overestimates than underestimates . this effect is akin to to eddington - malmquist bias , and tells us that we should not be surprised if the fluxes of the brighter galaxies are frequently found to be lower on remeasurement .      for these 21 hosts , the error - weighted mean 850   flux density is @xmath35  mjy .",
    "this can be used to test the null hypothesis of zero flux for the sample , and , as expected , rejects it with confidence . however , this number is not a fair estimate of the true mean of the sample since we have not accounted for the intrinsic dispersion in grb host galaxy luminosities ( about which we do not have prior knowledge ) , and also because the brighter galaxies were in some cases ( notably grb  010222 ) observed for longer and hence have smaller error bars for that reason .",
    "the unweighted mean is @xmath36  mjy , and is a fairer estimate of the true mean .",
    "this is higher than the average 850  flux density found for samples of lyman - break galaxies , which range between 0 and @xmath370.4  mjy , depending on the exact sample selection ( chapman  2000 ; peacock  2000 ; webb  2003 ) .",
    "what distribution do we expect to see ? as a starting point , we assume that both submm luminosity and grb rate are perfectly correlated with star formation rate . in that case , if submm flux and grb detection completeness were also perfectly redshift independent , then the predicted distribution would simply be the submm - luminosity - weighted luminosity function of all galaxies .",
    "ramirez - ruiz , trentham & blain ( 2002 ) use the models of blain  ( 1999a , b ) for the evolution of the submm galaxy population to predict the the 850  flux density distribution of grb hosts .",
    "uncertainties in the model are almost entirely due to the uncertain link between the grb rate and high - mass star formation heating dust .",
    "subject to the , probably low , rate of contamination in the submm galaxy population from agn heating , and to possible evolution of the initial mass function ( imf ) , the flux density distribution of submm galaxies is reasonably well constrained throughout the interval 115mjy ( blain  2002 ; borys  2003 ) . although it predates the substantially complete observed redshift distribution of submm galaxies from chapman  ( 2003a ) , the assumed model is in good agreement with these results .",
    "it is possible that the galaxies are systematically cooler and less luminous ( eg .",
    "efstathiou & rowan - robinson 2003 ) , however , if that is the case , then the redshift distribution is only consistent with significant evolution of the form of the far - infrared  radio correlation with redshift ;    figure 1 shows the predictions of this model as filled points . to provide a fair comparison ,",
    "the model output was convolved with with the distribution of observational errors , and includes a correction to allow for the possibility of the chance appearance of an unrelated submm source in the scuba beam .",
    "the latter correction amounts to roughly 0.7 of an object contaminating the 24  mjy bin and is based on the source counts summarised in blain  ( 2002 ) .",
    "we have chosen to put error bars on the model , reflecting the counting statistics of the proportion expected in each bin .",
    "the histogram represents the submm observations .",
    "it is apparent that there is a dearth of hosts with @xmath1 mjy 850  flux densities , which is becoming statistically significant ( formally , at the 1.6@xmath38 level ) .",
    "in fact , the significance is greater if we consider the remaining 5 galaxies with larger error bars , namely grb  970828 , grb  990308 , grb  001025a , grb  020124 and grb  020813 ( and indeed one might also include grb  980519 from smith 1999 ) , since at @xmath26 these are all inconsistent with being @xmath1  mjy sources as well .    furthermore , we note that if the estimated flux uncertainties are somewhat optimistic ( as suggested in section 3 ) , it tends to make the discrepancy between theory and observations rather worse .",
    "this seems counterintuitive , but is due to the fact that larger observational errors should result in more low luminosity systems appearing in the brighter bins by chance .    at this stage",
    "there are many possible explanations for the discrepancy ( beyond the relatively small sample size ) .",
    "first and foremost , we must still worry that amongst the grbs with `` very dark '' afterglows , for which good radio or x - ray positions are not available , lurk a small number of highly submm luminous hosts .",
    "another potential selection effect is that grbs are being preferentially picked up at lower redshifts , both in terms of initial detection , but more significantly the detection of the afterglows , as discussed in section 1.3 .",
    "this would be a less direct selection against the higher redshift , dusty systems , although we note that of the seven systems with @xmath39 , _ none _ have significant 850  fluxes .",
    "other possible physical explanations are : ( a ) that grbs are preferentially found in low metallicity  smaller and less dusty  systems .",
    "this has been predicted as a consequence of the single - star collapsar model ( heger  2003 ) , and is consistent with the apparent enhanced brightness of grbs in the outer parts of their parent galaxies ( ramirez - ruiz , lazzati & blain 2002 ) , and the relatively low metallicity inferred for many grb hosts ( eg . fynbo  2003 ) .",
    "the latter study notes that a a large proportion of grb hosts are ly@xmath5 emitters ( five out of five so far studied ) , which is significantly greater than the proportion of lyman - break galaxies , although perhaps surprisingly , many of the scuba galaxies for which chapman  have recently acquired redshifts , are also strong ly@xmath5 emitters ; ( b ) that the higher luminosity submm galaxies are more contaminated by agn , or the submm luminosity function more contaminated by cooler , less luminous galaxies , than has been generally thought ; ( c ) that whilst both grbs and submm flux trace star - formation rate , the two are not perfectly correlated due to different phase lags with respect to the true star formation rate .",
    "for instance , the simulation of bekki and shioya ( 2001 ) of a merger induced starburst , shows significant fluctuations in the star - formation rate on timescales much less than 100 myr ( their fig 6 ) .",
    "given that both grb rate and submm flux will not follow rapid fluctuations instantaneously , some decorrelation may occur .",
    "( d ) that variations in the stellar imf are having a different effect on grb rate compared to submm flux ; or ( e ) that grbs for some reason are occuring preferentially in galaxies with high dust temperatures , so more of the bolometric luminosity appears at shorter wavelengths and is being missed at 850 .",
    "if submm flux traces star formation , and the selection of grb hosts is unbiased , then the submm - bright grb hosts as a whole should be similar to the general population of submm bright galaxies .",
    "of course , now we are dealing with a very small sample , but it is interesting to examine the properties of the three hosts with 850  flux densities above 2  mjy .",
    "gorosabel  ( 2003a ) have constructed a uv to ir sed for the host to grb  000210 , which is well fit by a starburst sed with a relatively modest star formation rate of 2   and negligible extinction . the redshift is @xmath40 and the luminosity @xmath41 .",
    "the uv to ir sed of the grb  000418 host ( gorosabel  2003b ) is also well fit by a starburst template , in this case with a moderate amount of extinction @xmath42 , and a star formation rate up to 60  .",
    "a similar result is obtained in the spectroscopic study of bloom  ( 2003 ) , who also find no evidence of any agn contamination .",
    "this star formation rate is still an order of magnitude less than that derived from the submm , but that is not unreasonable for heavily obscured galaxies .",
    "the redshift is @xmath43 and the luminosity is @xmath44 .",
    "it is compact with effective radius @xmath45 kpc , and the afterglow was located close to the optical centroid ( fruchter & metzger 2001 ; bloom  2003 ) .",
    "the afterglow itself has produced extinction estimates ranging from @xmath42 ( berger  2001a ) to @xmath46 ( klose  2000 ) .",
    "the host of grb  010222 is fainter still in the optical at @xmath47 ( fruchter  2001a ) , but it is also moderately blue , with @xmath48 and an intrinsic luminosity @xmath49 ( frail  2002 ) .",
    "the redshift is @xmath50 and again _ hst _ images reveal the afterglow to have been located on top of the peak of the optical emission .    in all these cases",
    "if the submm is really indicating copious amounts of hidden star formation activity , it would appear that the optically visible part of the host is dominated by one or more relatively unextinguished regions .",
    "this is plausible  it could be concentrated in a shell or plume of material , or possibly a number of `` windows '' through an obscuring shroud ( eg .",
    "bekki  1999 ) . however , if this is the case , it also seems that the optically bright regions must be spatially proximate to the bright far - ir emission if we are to understand why the afterglows ( as with most detected grbs ) tend to be found close to the optical centroids ( or hotspots ) of the hosts .",
    "so , how do the properties of these galaxies compare with the the optical / ir counterparts of the submm bright galaxies selected in blank - field scuba surveys ?",
    "in fact the bright scuba galaxies display quite a wide variety of characteristics .",
    "they have been split into three classes ( smail  2002 ) : class 0 are relatively bright in optical as well as submm  much of the star formation is unextinguished ; class 1 are extremely red objects ( eros ) with @xmath51 typically greater than 5 ; finally class 2 are extremely faint in optical and ir .",
    "this classification system was conceived based on galaxies which are generally brighter than 5  mjy at 850 .",
    "although no grb host to - date is that bright , it appears the the submm brightest of the grb hosts do not fit neatly into this scheme , being intermediate in optical / ir luminosity between classes 0 and 2 , but not very red eros like class 1 .",
    "interestingly , the best candidate for an extremely red grb host galaxy , that of grb  980326 which has @xmath52 ( although the @xmath53 detection at @xmath54 is @xmath55 ; chary , becklin & armus 2002 ) , has a low submm luminosity .",
    "this compares to an average 850  flux density of @xmath56  mjy recently found by wehner , barger & kneib ( 2002 ) for a @xmath53-selected sample of eros .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in section 1.2 , the redshift distribution of bright scuba sources shows a peak in the redshift range 23 , whereas these 3 submm bright grb hosts are nearer @xmath15 .",
    "we conclude that the properties of the few submm bright grb hosts found to - date are not very representative of the submm - bright galaxies as a whole : they do not fit easily within any of the 3 classes .",
    "be03 reached the same conclusion based on a colour  redshift plot , in which the submm - bright grb hosts lie bluer and at lower redshift than the submm selected galaxies as a whole .",
    "this could be because the grb hosts are somewhat fainter at 850 , since nearly all well studied submm samples are @xmath57  mjy ( although frayer  2003 report a detailed study of a single gravitationally lensed source at @xmath58 , which has a low submm flux density of @xmath59  mjy after correction for lensing ) .",
    "as discussed above , we also expect grb selection to provide some bias toward picking up lower redshift galaxies , and against very dusty galaxies .",
    "the alternative , of course , is that either the submm selection has some problems , such as a surprising rate of agn contamination , or surprising dust properties , or grb progenitors are more likely to arise in less dusty systems .",
    "we have shown that whilst a small number of grb hosts are bright submm galaxies , indicating high star formation rates , the proportion , particularly at flux densities @xmath1  mjy , is fewer than predicted if both grbs and submm flux trace star formation in an unbiased way . furthermore , and similarly puzzling , the three submm - brightest grb hosts are not very typical in terms of their optical properties and redshift distribution of the galaxies selected in blind submm surveys .",
    "of course , the current sample size is still rather small , and very likely suffers some selection biases . in particular , grbs in very dusty hosts and/or at higher redshifts",
    "are more likely to be missing from the observed afterglow samples .",
    "a small number of these amongst the `` dark '' bursts ( those without optical counterparts to deep limits ) could remove the discrepancy  although the afterglows known to be genuinely very faint is only a small fraction of those for which optical emission has not been detected .",
    "furthermore , a fair proportion of the darker bursts seem to be dark for reasons other than their residing in high redshift , dusty ulirgs , so it s not obvious that this selection effect provides the full explanation .",
    "future studies may largely overcome these selection problems by much earlier and more uniform afterglow searches with _ swift _ and various robotic telescopes",
    ". the positions from the _ swift_/xrt may be good enough to identify ulirg hosts , even when no optical afterglow is detected .",
    "_ spitzer _ will also be a powerful tool , particularly the for the lower redshift hosts @xmath60 , where the large majority of the bolometric luminosity appears in the far - ir .",
    "if it turns out that the discrepancy with the model predictions persists when more complete samples are studied , it will certainly be telling us something interesting about the astrophysics of grbs and/or the relationship between fir emission and star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the disagreement goes away , the use of grbs as practical star formation indicators will be strongly bolstered .",
    "we thank the referee , steve serjeant , for insightful comments , jochen greiner for keeping his invaluable website up to date ( http://www.mpe.mpg.de/@xmath37jcg/grbgen.html ) and paul vreeswijk , jens hjorth , javier gorosabel and johan fynbo for useful discussions .",
    "we also thank all the observers and staff at the jcmt who carried out flexible - scheduled observations on our behalf .",
