    "@xcite these two materials are isostructural with a negligible difference in lattice constants  @xcite ( about 0.3 % ) and about 1 % difference in atomic mass between lu and yb . however , their electronic structures are strikingly different due to the @xmath4-level occupancies in lu and yb .",

    "in ultrafast optical pump - probe spectroscopy , an ultrafast laser pulse initially excites the electron system , and the probe pulse monitors the relaxation of the electron system by measuring transient optical properties with subpicosecond time - resolution . because the diffusion of heat out of the illuminated ( probed ) region is much slower ( tens to hundreds of nanoseconds ) than the time scales of interest , the relaxation of the excited electrons is due to the thermalization among electrons and other degrees of freedom , such as phonons , within the illuminated areas .",
    "the most commonly used model for the relaxation dynamics of photoexcited electrons in metals is called the two - temperature model ( ttm ) ,  @xcite which assumes much faster relaxation _ within _ each constituent system ( e.g. , electron system , phonon system ) compared to the relaxation _ between _ these constituent systems . in this approximation ,",
    "the temperature of each system can be defined during relaxation , and the relaxation time @xmath13 between system 1 and 2 is determined by their specific heats , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the energy transfer rate per temperature difference , @xmath16 :  @xcite @xmath17 kaganov , lifshitz , and tanatarov  @xcite calculated the energy transfer rate @xmath16 between electrons ( e ) and phonons ( p ) in normal metals by solving coupled boltzmann transport equations for electrons and phonons with thermal equilibrium distributions at different temperatures .",

    "their experimental data was inconsistent with the ttm predictions for @xmath13 versus @xmath0 and @xmath13 versus @xmath26 , which led groeneveld",
    "_ to consider the nonthermal electron model ( nem ) .",
    "using a simple estimate , they pointed out that the relaxation time within the electron system is comparable to the electron - phonon relaxation time . instead of assuming a thermal equilibrium distribution for the electrons , they numerically solved the boltzmann equation for _ electrons _ with electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering , starting from an initial nonthermal electron distribution created by a laser pulse .",

    "therefore , the above blocking mechanism applies only when both the initial and final electron states are within the peak of the dos .",
