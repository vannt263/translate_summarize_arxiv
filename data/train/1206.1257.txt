    "a proper relativistic formulation of the electroweak structure of few - body bound states poses several problems .",
    "even if one has model wave functions for the few - body bound states one is interested in , it is not straightforward to construct electromagnetic and weak currents with all the properties it should have .",
    "two basic features are poincar covariance and cluster separability  @xcite .",
    "the latter means that the bound - state current should become a sum of subsystem currents , if the interaction between the subsystems is turned off .",
    "this property is closely related to the requirement that the charge of the whole system should be the sum of the subsystem charges , irrespective whether the interaction is present or not  @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic currents should , furthermore , satisfy current conservation and in the case of electroweak currents of heavy - light systems one has restrictions coming from heavy - quark symmetry that should be satisfied if the mass of the heavy quark goes to infinity  @xcite .",
    "this is the topic which we will concentrate on in this paper keeping , of course , also the other requirements for a reasonable current in mind .",
    "the main ingredients in the construction of currents are the wave functions of the incoming and outgoing few body bound states .",
    "since momentum is transferred to the bound state in the course of an electroweak process , one has to know how to boost the wave function , which is usually calculated for the bound state at rest , to the initial and final state , respectively .",
    "a procedure which provides wave functions for interacting few - body systems with well defined relativistic boost properties is the , so called , bakamjian - thomas construction  @xcite .",
    "it gives an interacting representation of the poincar algebra on a few - body hilbert space , allows even for instantaneous interactions , and it works in the 3 common forms of relativistic hamiltonian dynamics  @xcite , the instant form , the front form and the point form .",
    "these forms are characterized by which of the poincar generators contain interaction terms and which are interaction free . in the point - form , which we are going to use ,",
    "all 4 components of the 4-momentum operator are interaction dependent , whereas the lorentz generators stay free of interactions . as a consequence boosts and the addition of angular momenta become simple .",
    "there is a long list of papers in which relativistic constituent - quark models serve as a starting point for the calculation of the electroweak structure of heavy - light mesons .",
    "a lot of these calculations have been done in front form , like e.g. those in refs.@xcite , to mention a few . in these papers",
    "the electromagnetic and weak meson currents are usually approximated by one - body currents , which means that those currents are assumed to be a sum of contributions in which the gauge boson couples only to one of the constituents , whereas the others act as spectators .",
    "it is well known that this approximation leads to problems with covariance of the currents in front form and in instant form  @xcite .",
    "the form factors extracted from such a one - body approximation of a current depend , in general , on the frame in which the approximation is made . in the covariant front - form formulation suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite this problem is circumvented by introducing additional , spurious covariants and form factors that are associated with the chosen orientation of the light front .",
    "another way to cure this problem is the introduction of a non - valence contribution leading to a , so called , z - graph  @xcite .",
    "such a non - valence contribution to the currents is also included in an effective way in the instant - form approach of ebert et al .",
    "this is a very sophisticated constituent - quark model for heavy - light systems based on a quasipotential approach .",
    "a whole series of papers by ebert and collaborators deals very comprehensively with spectroscopy , structure and decays of heavy - light mesons and baryons . in connection with instant form",
    "constituent - quark models one should also mention the papers of le yaouanc et al .",
    "( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they were the first to prove that covariance of a one - body current is recovered , if the mass of the heavy quark goes to infinity  @xcite .",
    "thereby they made use of the known boost properties of wave functions within the bakamjian - thomas formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "on the contrary , the literature on point - form calculations of heavy - light systems is very sparse , although the point form seems to be particularly suited for the treatment of this kind of systems .",
    "we are only aware of two papers by keister  @xcite .",
    "this is one of our motivations to investigate the electroweak structure of heavy - light mesons within the point form of relativistic dynamics .",
    "although it is possible to formulate a covariant one - body current in point form  @xcite , we will adopt a different strategy . instead of making a particular ansatz for the electromagnetic and weak currents and extract the form factors from these currents ,",
    "we rather want to derive these currents in such a way that they are compatible with the binding forces .",
    "the idea is to treat the physical processes in which the electroweak form factors are measured in a poincar invariant way by means of the bakamjian - thomas formalism .",
    "this gives us 1-@xmath1 and 1-@xmath2-exchange amplitudes from which the currents and form factors can be extracted .",
    "this kind of procedure has already been applied successfully to the calculate electromagnetic form factors of spin-0 and spin-1 two - body bound states consisting of equal - mass particles  @xcite .",
    "these calculations were restricted to space - like momentum transfers . for instantaneous binding forces",
    "the results were found to be equivalent with those obtained with a one - body ansatz for the current in the covariant front - form approach  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is an extension of the foregoing work to unequal - mass constituents and to weak decay form factors in the time - like momentum transfer region .",
    "it is also intended as a check whether the additional restrictions coming from heavy - quark symmetry can be accounted for within our approach .    the general poincar invariant framework that we use to describe electron - meson scattering and semileptonic weak decays of mesons",

    "] we suppose that this equivalence extends to the case of bound states with unequal - mass constituents and generalizes to electroweak @xmath340 transition form factors ( for space - like momentum transfers ) , although we have not tried to prove it analytically .",
    "if this is the case , the heavy - quark limit of electroweak heavy - light meson ( transition ) form factors in front - form and point - form should also lead to the same isgur - wise function .",
    "there is still one gap in this reasoning .",

    "@xcite derive their isgur - wise function from weak @xmath5 decay form factors , i.e. in the time - like momentum transfer region .",
    "it can not be taken for granted that the heavy - quark limit of a one - body current , like it is used in refs.@xcite , gives the same result for the isgur - wise function in the space- and time - like momentum - transfer regions .",
    "going from space- to time - like momentum transfers means that one has to give up the @xmath168 condition and , as a consequence , @xmath341-graphs ( i.e. non - valence contributions ) may become important  @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by an analysis of the triangle diagram for @xmath5 decays within a simple covariant model  @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that analytic continuation ( @xmath342 ) of the @xmath5 transition form factors calculated in a @xmath168 frame for space - like momentum transfers to time - like momentum transfers leads to the same results as a direct calculation of the @xmath5 decay form factors in the time - like region ( @xmath343 ) , provided that @xmath341-graph contributions are appropriately taken into account .",
    "the importance of @xmath341-graph contributions , however , decreases with increasing mass of the heavy quark and is generally assumed to vanish in the heavy - quark limit , since an infinitely heavy quark - antiquark pair can not be produced out of the vacuum .",
    "thus it is most likely that the heavy - quark limit of a one - body current formulated within front - form dynamics gives the same result for the isgur - wise function in the space- and time - like momentum - transfer regions , as it is the case in our point - form approach .",
    "heavy - quark symmetry is broken for finite heavy - quark masses .",
    "but within any reasonable theoretical model for the electroweak structure of heavy - light hadrons the heavy - quark limit of the form factors ( multiplied with appropriate kinematical factors ) should go over into one universal function , the isgur - wise function .",
    "it is , however , also interesting see what has to be expected from experimental measurements of the form factors and to estimate how large heavy - quark - symmetry breaking effects are for physical masses of the heavy quarks .",

    "thus also has to multiply the isgur - wise function with the charge of the heavy quark .",
    "for @xmath345 the contribution of the light quark provides a peak which becomes more pronounced with increasing mass of the heavy quark . in the case of the @xmath3-meson",
    "the heavy - quark contribution starts to dominate at @xmath346 ( which corresponds to @xmath347  gev@xmath348 ) and the @xmath349-dependence of the form factor resembles the one of the isgur - wise function with the absolute magnitude differing by about @xmath350 in the considered @xmath349-range . for the @xmath4-meson the dominance of the heavy - quark contribution sets in at about the same momentum transfer ( @xmath347  gev@xmath348 ) , corresponding to @xmath351 ( cf .",

    "one still has a spurious covariant and the @xmath6-dependence of the form factors goes over into a dependence on the ( common ) modulus of the incoming and outgoing 3-velocities of the heavy meson .",
    "this dependence on the modulus of the meson velocities vanishes by taking it large enough . in the limit of infinitely large meson velocities we found a rather simple analytical expression for the isgur - wise function which turned out to be ( apart of a change of integration variables ) the same as the expression which we got from the decay form factors .",

    "it is not possible to separate physical and spurious contributions since the respective covariants become proportional .",
    "the dependence of the electromagnetic pseudoscalar meson form factor on mandelstam-@xmath6 and the dependence of the resulting isgur - wise function on the modulus of the meson velocities may be interpreted as a frame dependence of the @xmath385 subprocess .",
    "the @xmath167 ( velocities @xmath386 ) limit corresponds to the infinite - momentum frame , whereas minimum @xmath6 ( minimum velocities ) corresponds to the breit frame .",
