    "many experiments @xciteof two - pion photoproductions on the nucleon have been performed in the past over the second nucleon - resonance energy where the @xmath2 resonance plays an important role .",
    "two charged pion photoproduction , i.e. , @xmath3 , is well understood by theoretical models . however",
    ", none of the theoretical models have succeeded to explain the data of all isospin channels simultaneously .",
    "this means that there are some unknown production mechanisms which are not taken into account yet .",
    "recently , the total cross sections and invariant mass distributions of two - pion photoproductions followed by neutral pion emission , i.e. , @xmath4@xcite , @xmath5@xcite and @xmath6@xcite reactions , have been measured at the mainz accelerator facility mami using the detector system with improved resolution at the photon energy up to around 0.8 gev .",
    "the aim of these experiments was to obtain the information on the structure of the nucleon resonance and explore the reaction mechanisms .",
    "the @xmath4 and@xmath7 reactions have attracted special attention , since the detailed study of them could provide a new aspect on the reaction mechanisms which are related to @xmath8 meson production .",
    "there are notable differences between the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 photoproductions .",
    "the @xmath8 meson production as an intermediate process is allowed to the @xmath12 ( @xmath10 ) photoproduction but is forbidden to the @xmath11 photoproduction due to isospin conservation . on the other hand ,",
    "the isospin @xmath13 @xmath14 system such as @xmath15 meson may contribute to only the @xmath11 photoproduction .",
    "furthermore , the strength of the @xmath16 kroll - rudermann process in the @xmath17(@xmath10 ) photoproduction is weak compared with that in the @xmath18 photoproduction where its process dominates and is suppressed in the @xmath11 photoproduction . based on these characteristic features and the comparison between the measured @xmath17 and @xmath11 invariant mass distributions , w.langgrtner et al . @xciteconcluded that the @xmath8 decay of the @xmath2 resonance was directly observed in the @xmath4 reaction .",
    "theoretically , several works@xcite have been already done to explain the total cross sections of two - pion photoproductions in various isospin channels .",
    "the total cross sections of  the @xmath19 reaction have been well reproduced by several theoretical models@xcite where the @xmath16 kroll - rudermann , @xmath16-pion - pole and @xmath2 resonant terms were found to be dominant .",
    "these models , however , could not predict the total cross sections of the above reactions accompanied by neutral pions consistently .",
    "the models of tejedor - oset@xcite and murphy - laget@xcite underestimated the cross sections of @xmath4 seriously , although the former model could reproduce the cross sections of @xmath20 .",
    "the model of ochi - hirata - takaki@xcite could reproduce the @xmath4 and @xmath6 cross sections as well as @xmath21 cross sections , although it underestimated the @xmath20 cross sections .",
    "their calculations indicated that the @xmath8 meson productions , i.e. , the @xmath22 process and @xmath8 kroll - ruderman process , play an essential role in the @xmath23 and @xmath6 reactions where the mass of @xmath8 meson produced in the intermediate state is always smaller than the on - shell value at the relevant energies . in their model , the @xmath8 meson is treated in a dynamical way where the finite - range @xmath24 form factor is assumed . in order to obtain large cross sections of the @xmath4 and @xmath6 reactions , a rather soft @xmath24 form factor , which makes the contribution of the @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term large ,",
    "was needed . because of the soft @xmath24 form factor , however , the dynamical model for the @xmath8 meson overestimates the @xmath14 p - wave ( isospin @xmath25 ) phase shifts at low energies .",
    "they speculated that the large @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term in their model might simulate a background process in the isospin @xmath25 channel effectively rather than the @xmath8 meson production .",
    "the presence of such a background process is inferred from the fact that in the isovector @xmath14 spectral function derived from the @xmath26 helicity amplitudes@xcite , there is a strong enhancement near the @xmath14 threshold as well as the resonant structure by the @xmath8 meson .",
    "this bump at low energies is actually due to the non - resonant process described by the partial amplitude of the nucleon born term projected to the @xmath27 @xmath14(@xmath28 ) channel .    in this paper , motivated by the above speculation",
    ", we will investigate the effect of the non - resonant reaction mechanisms , particularly , the background terms arising from the @xmath0 coupling that were so far considered to have only small contributions to the cross sections and were always taken to be the pseudovector ( pv ) coupling . in the studies of single pion photoproductions",
    ", it has been shown that the pv @xmath0 coupling is preferred at low energies but the pseudoscalar ( ps ) @xmath0 coupling is needed to get a better description at higher energies@xcite and furthermore the two @xmath0 couplings lead to rather different cross sections for the neutral pion production@xcite .",
    "these facts imply that the ps coupling becomes important at larger off - shell nucleon momenta and thus will have a significant influence on the two - pion photoproductions accompanied by the neutral pion such as the @xmath29 and @xmath20 reactions . in our calculations with two different couplings",
    ", we will show that the non - resonant photoproduction by the ps coupling significantly contributes to the total cross sections of the two - pion photoproductions involving the neutral pion compared with that by the pv coupling and consequently plays a similar role with the strong @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term introduced in the model by ochi et al.@xcite . from the comparison between the full calculations with resonant processes and the experimental data , furthermore , we will demonstrate that the ps coupling is more favored than the pv coupling for the two - pion photoproductions at the relevant energies .",
    "recently , nacher et al.@xcite have improved the model of tejedor - oset@xcite by including the @xmath30 production and the @xmath8 meson effect arising from the @xmath2 production . in their calculations with the pv coupling , they found that the @xmath8 meson effect largely increased the @xmath29 total cross sections compared with the previous model and put the calculations close to the data , although there still remained some disagreement with the data around the peak for both the @xmath29 and @xmath31 cross sections .",
    "we will discuss why their model can largely improve the calculations of the @xmath29 cross sections without introducing the strong @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term used in the model by ochi et al.@xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we will discuss the background processes and @xmath0 coupling . in section iii",
    ", we will review how to treat the resonance processes . in section iv",
    ", we will show our full calculations of the total cross sections , invariant mass spectra and helicity - dependent cross sections and discuss the difference between the ps and pv couplings from the comparison with the data .  in section",
    "v , we will give our concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we discuss the non - resonant processes arising from the @xmath32 coupling and vector mesons .",
    "there are two types of @xmath0 couplings : the pseudoscalar ( ps ) coupling and the pseudovector ( pv ) coupling .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath33 for the ps coupling , and @xmath34 for the pv coupling , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the nucleon and pion fields , respectively , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the pion and nucleon masses , respectively .",
    "these couplings are equivalent when both the nucleons are on - shell .",
    "if a photon line is attached to the @xmath0 system so as to become gauge - invariant , one obtains the feynman diagrams of the born terms for the one - pion photoproduction whose expressions depend on the @xmath0 coupling . the @xmath41 kroll - ruderman term is included in the pv born terms .",
    "the born terms calculated with the two couplings are rather different each other because of their different off - shellness .",
    "the pv coupling is preferable to the ps coupling at low energies because the pv born terms are consistent with low energy theorems and current algebra predictions .",
    "in fact , the model with the pv coupling is able to reproduce the @xmath42 multipole  up to the @xmath43 resonance energy region but the model with the ps coupling fails . as the incident photon energy increases over 500 mev",
    ", however , the pure pv coupling can not explain the @xmath42 and @xmath44 multipoles and the ps coupling is needed to describe them@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath0 vertex for the far off - shell nucleon is largely pseudoscalar in nature .",
    "we note that only the multipoles @xmath42 and @xmath44 are affected by changing the coupling scheme and the two @xmath0 couplings give rise to significantly different cross sections for the neutral pion photoproduction but are almost indistinguishable in the charged pion photoproduction .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see the difference between the pv and ps couplings in the two - pion photoproduction around the @xmath2 resonance energy region where the far off - shell nucleons are involved in the intermediate state .    before going to the @xmath1 reaction",
    ", we discuss briefly the strong interaction part relevant to the two - pion production . in the @xmath45 scattering at low energies , the born terms constructed with the pv coupling are also preferable to those with the ps coupling like the @xmath46 reaction . in this case , for instance , the s - wave isoscalar scattering length calculated from the ps born terms is very large and in disagreement with the data . in dispersion relation theory ,",
    "the ps born terms correspond to nucleon - pole terms and the pv born terms are understood to include strong corrections coming from the dispersive integral in addition to the pole terms .",
    "these corrections are important to well describe the low energy data of the @xmath47 scattering and may be partially related to the @xmath15 meson exchange contribution as inferred from the linear @xmath15 model .",
    "when constructing the model for the @xmath1 reaction with the ps @xmath0 coupling , these corrections must be taken into account .",
    "to do so , we introduce the following effective lagrangian @xmath48 the sum of the ps born terms and their correction terms calculated from the above effective lagrangian are equivalent to the pv born terms for the strong interaction processes such as @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we note that the @xmath47 isoscalar scattering length calculated in these models are consistent with the value obtained by taking @xmath51 in the linear @xmath15 model , where @xmath52 is the @xmath15 meson mass .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.ps    the diagrams shown in fig.1 for the @xmath1 reaction are obtained by attaching an external photon line to the diagrams of the @xmath53 processes based on the requirement of the gauge invariance .",
    "the diagrams calculated with the pv coupling correspond to fig.1(a)-(g ) and especially the diagrams ( f ) and ( g ) include the @xmath41 kroll - rutherman term arising from the derivative @xmath0 coupling . on the other hand , the diagrams calculated with the ps coupling and the above effective lagrangian correspond to fig.1(a)-(e ) and ( h)-(k ) , respectively .",
    "they will be referred to as pv model and ps model , respectively . for the second term ( isovector term ) of eq.([contact ] ) , only the diagram ( k ) of fig.1 is computed in actual calculations because the contributions of the other diagrams are negligible . here the lagrangians for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 couplings are given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the photon field , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the electromagnetic form factors which are taken to be @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the proton and @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the neutron , respectively .",
    "the other lagrangians for coupling of a photon and hadrons are obtained from the minimal substitution ( @xmath64 ) in the lagrangians of @xmath0 and @xmath65  derivative vertices .",
    "the resultant amplitudes for the @xmath66 reaction will give rather different cross sections depending on whether the ps model or pv model is used because of their different off - shell behavior , as expected from the above discussion about the @xmath46 reaction .",
    "we will show the difference from the numerical results later .    as other non - resonant processes , we include the contributions of vector mesons such as @xmath8 meson and @xmath67 meson . in the analysis of the @xmath68 reaction ,",
    "these contributions are known to be important although their magnitude is small .",
    "the hadronic lagrangians involving these vector mesons are @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the @xmath8 and @xmath67 meson fields , respectively and the coupling constants are taken to be @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the electromagnetic lagrangian for the @xmath74 coupling is @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "[ ptb ]    fig2.ps    the diagrams for the @xmath1 reaction involving the @xmath8 and @xmath67 mesons are shown in fig.2 and are calculated by using the above lagrangians . for the @xmath67 meson contribution ,",
    "diagrams ( g ) and ( h ) in fig.2 are taken into account .",
    "the diagram ( c ) ( called @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term ) comes from the derivative @xmath78 tensor coupling . in the diagrams of ( a)-(d ) in fig.2",
    ", the @xmath8 meson decays into two real pions directly and so the @xmath8 propagator @xmath79 must include the decay effect , whose form is assumed to be @xmath80 with @xmath81 here the @xmath8 meson mass @xmath82mev , its width @xmath83 mev , and @xmath84 stands for the pion momentum in the @xmath14 center of mass system . in our present model ,",
    "the @xmath8 meson displayed in fig.2 is treated in the same way used in ref.@xcite where the @xmath24 vertex function is simply given by the lagrangian of eq.([rho ] ) .",
    "even though one uses the @xmath24 vertex function with the finite - range form factor employed in ref.@xcite , there is no drastic numerical change from the above way in the magnitude of the @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term as far as one uses the range parameter determined so as to reproduce the @xmath14 p - wave ( isospin @xmath25 ) phase shifts .    for the diagrams involving the off - shell meson coupled to nucleon in fig.1 and fig.2",
    ",  we take into account a form factor of the following form : @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the meson mass and the square of four - momentum , respectively and the range parameter @xmath88 is taken to be @xmath89 gev for @xmath41 , @xmath90 gev for both @xmath8 and @xmath67 , respectively@xcite .",
    "the pion form factor is used for the diagrams ( d ) and ( e ) in fig.1 and the @xmath8 meson and @xmath67 meson form factors are used for ( a)-(f ) and ( g)-(h ) in fig.2 , respectively . for the diagrams ( f ) and ( g ) in fig.1 ( @xmath41 kroll - ruderman term ) , the same pion form factor is used and evaluated at the momentum transfer between the incident photon and the outgoing pion .",
    "the diagram ( c ) in fig.2 ( @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term ) is treated in the same way as the @xmath41 kroll - ruderman term .",
    "we note that the gauge invariance of the transition amplitudes is destroyed by the inclusion of the decay width in the propagator and the form factor for the hadronic vertex .",
    "however , we consider such strong interaction corrections are more important than the gauge invariance from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "in fact , the form factor used in the @xmath16 kroll - ruderman term ( see fig.5(a ) ) influences significantly on the magnitude of the @xmath21 cross section and provides a good agreement with the data@xcite .",
    "now we discuss the differences between the ps and pv models through numerical calculations of the cross sections .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath91 reaction is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 are the four - momenta of  the initial photon , initial nucleon , final nucleon , and outgoing pion , respectively , @xmath97 is the relative velocity between the initial nucleon and photon , and @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the cross section is evaluated in the @xmath100 center - of - mass system .",
    "the t matrix is in general expressed as @xmath101 , which is summed over the final nucleon spin states @xmath102 and averaged over the initial nucleon spin states @xmath103 .",

    "here @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the dirac spinors for nucleon and anti - nucleon , respectively and@xmath120 is the two - component spinor . in this expression , we neglect the @xmath121 contributions .",
    "however , we found this approximate t matrix gives nearly the same result as the exact one within the present energy region .",
    "the calculations for the other diagrams are performed in a similar fashion .  in this sense",
    ", the t matrix is evaluated in a relativistic way .    in order to estimate the relativistic effect , we calculated the cross section with the pv coupling for the diagrams ( a)-(g ) in fig.1 in both relativistic and non - relativistic ways . here",
    "non - relativistic approximations mean that both the anti - particle contributions and terms of order @xmath122 or higher in vertex operators are neglected but the denominators of the propagator are treated in a relativistic way .",
    "we found that the relativistic calculations are about 30 - 60@xmath123 larger than the non - relativistic calculations around the @xmath2 resonance energy .",
    "this indicates that the relativistic effect , which have been so far neglected in previous studies , should not be discarded for the non - resonant process in the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "now we show the calculations of total cross sections for three isospin channels : @xmath21 , @xmath124 and @xmath20 in fig.3 . here",
    "solid and dashed lines correspond to the full non - resonant calculations for the ps and pv models including the vector meson contributions ( fig.2 ) , respectively .",
    "we observe that the pv results of the @xmath18 channel are close to the ps results , while in the @xmath125 and @xmath11 channels there are significant differences and the ps calculations are larger than the pv calculations .",
    "the similar feature can be seen in the one - pion photoproduction where the difference between two couplings is prominent in the neutral pion photoproduction but is very small in the charged pion photoproduction .",
    "this arises certainly from the different off - shell behavior between the pv and ps @xmath0 couplings . for the one - pion photoproduction",
    ", such difference appears in the born terms proportional to the anomalous magnetic moment obtained using the second term of eq.([gnn ] ) .",
    "in fact , if @xmath59 is set to zero , the difference between the ps and pv calculations disappears .",
    "the same things happen for the two - pion photoproduction , which has been examined numerically .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the ps calculation in the @xmath4 channel is remarkably larger than the pv calculation and is roughly consistent with the size of the @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term introduced in the model of ochi et al.@xcite , by which the large measured cross sections have been successfully explained . in order to reproduce the data ,",
    "however , the small range - paramater of the @xmath24 form factor must have been used and it gave rise to the larger @xmath14 scattering p - wave phase shift at low energies compared with the experimental value .",
    "we think that the @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term with this form factor simulates a non - negligible background process originating from the strong coupling between the nucleon and @xmath27 @xmath14 system as is inferred from strong enhancement at low energies in the isovector @xmath14 spectral function derived from the @xmath126 helicity amplitude@xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term is considered to represent the non - resonant process arising from the ps coupling effectively .    in fig.3",
    ", we also show the results for the born terms coming from the ps coupling ( dotted lines ) corresponding to the diagrams ( a)-(e ) in fig.1 .",
    "we find that the contribution to the @xmath21 channel is extremely large and is mostly attributed to the pion pole terms ( diagrams ( d ) and ( e ) in fig.1 ) .",
    "the similar situation occurs when one calculates the @xmath47 isoscalar s - wave scattering length with the ps coupling .",
    "these unfavorable results can be improved by introducing the contact interaction of eq.([contact ] ) as mentioned before .",
    "this effect is seen in the calculations with the contact terms ( dash - two - dotted lines in fig.3 ) . here",
    "the contact terms correspond to the diagrams ( h)-(k ) in fig.1 and consist of the isoscalar and isovector parts .",
    "the isoscalar term contributes to the @xmath19 and @xmath127 channels and the isovector term contributes to the @xmath21 and @xmath29 channels , and the isoscalar term has larger coupling constant than the isovector term as understood from eq.([contact ] ) .",
    "the size of these terms can be seen in the calculations in fig.3 .    for comparison ,",
    "the result for the born terms coming from the pv coupling ( diagrams ( a)-(g ) in fig.1 ) is also shown by dash - dotted line in fig.3 .",
    "the dash - dotted line is drawn only in the @xmath21 channel but omitted in other channels since the full non - resonant calculations ( dashed line ) in other channels are almost overlapped with the dash - dotted line .",
    "the difference between the solid and dash - two - dotted lines or between the dashed and dash - dotted lines arises from the vector meson contributions of the diagrams in fig.2 .",
    "the contributions are relatively small .",
    "this smallness is mainly attributed to the effect of form factors used .  in this paper",
    ", we do not pursue this effect furthermore .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig4.eps    in order to see the difference between the ps and pv models in further detail ,  the @xmath14 invariant - mass spectra are calculated and the results at @xmath128mev are shown in fig .",

    "apart from the size of the distributions ,  the difference of the shape can be seen in these distributions , especially in the @xmath129 channel .  even in the ps calculations for the @xmath21 and @xmath29 channels , there are some shifts of the peak to the higher invariant mass compared with the pv calculations . here",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath130 system relevant to the @xmath8 meson can contribute to the @xmath21 and @xmath29 reactions and on the other hand the @xmath131 system relevant to the @xmath15 meson can contribute to the @xmath21 and @xmath20 reactions .",
    "the correlations for the final @xmath14 system might influence both the shape and size of the distributions but in our calculations they are not taken into account . in this work , as a first step , we would like to demonstrate how different the ps model and pv model are within our present framework . in order to compare the calculations with the experimental data , the resonant contributions must be included .",
    "we will employ a simple model for the resonant processes , which will be discussed in next section .",

    "although the calculations agree qualitatively with the data , the cross section @xmath284 is underestimated and the cross section @xmath285 is overestimated .",
    "the detailed description of the reaction mechanism is still unsatisfactory for this channel and is needed to pursue what is missing in our model . for the @xmath29 reaction ,",
    "the ps model can almost explain two helicity - dependent cross sections simultaneously except for the cross section @xmath285 around 750 mev .",
    "on the other hand , the pv model underestimates the cross section @xmath284 and also @xmath285 slightly . in this model ,",
    "non - resonant processes in the helicity 3/2 channel are not strong enough to explain the data .",
    "this result is not consistent with that obtained from the model by nacher et al.@xcite .",
    "this is due to the same reason mentioned in the discussions of the total cross sections . for the @xmath20 reaction",
    ", we observe that there is a large difference between the ps and pv models in the cross section @xmath285 .",
    "the experimental data , if exist , could provide an important information on the reaction mechanism .",
    "several theoretical studies on the two - pion photoproduction have been performed in the past but none of them have succeeded to reproduce the data in all isospin channels simultaneously .",
    "particularly , unexpectedly large cross sections of the @xmath29 and @xmath288 reactions were found not to be explained with the usual reaction mechanism and thus the presence of a new reaction mechanism in these channels is suggested .",
    "ochi et al.@xciteintroduced the @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term , which influences only on the above isospin channels , as a new reaction mechanism .",
    "however , a soft @xmath24 form factor was needed to reproduce the large cross sections and the isobar model with such a form factor failed to explain the @xmath14 scattering at low energies .",
    "thus , the @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term was inferred to represent the effect of the background process followed by the production of the @xmath27 @xmath14 system rather than the @xmath8 meson itself .    in this paper",
    "we have discussed the effect of the non - resonant processes arising from the ps and pv @xmath0 couplings in the two - pion photoproduction in order to pursue an alternative reaction mechanism .",
    "the non - resonant amplitudes can be obtained by attaching an external photon line to the diagram of @xmath53 calculated with the two @xmath0 couplings . in order",
    "that the model with the ps @xmath0 coupling is equivalent to the model with the pv @xmath0 coupling in the strong interaction process @xmath53 ,  the effective contact interaction ( eq.([contact ] ) ) is added to the former model . using these models , we examined the effect of the two couplings on various isospin channels numerically . for the @xmath4 and @xmath6 reactions",
    ", we found that the cross sections calculated with the ps model were larger than those with the pv model and their magnitude was almost consistent with the @xmath8 kroll - ruderman  used in ref.@xcite .",
    "consequently , the non - resonant process described by the ps @xmath0 coupling can be regarded as a candidate for the new reaction mechanism in place of the @xmath8 kroll - ruderman term .",
    "the importance of the ps @xmath0 coupling in the two - pion photoproduction has not been so far noticed .",
    "in fact the non - resonant process has been always described by the pv @xmath0 coupling and has been found to have only a minor contribution to the two - pion photoproduction .",
    "the pv @xmath0 coupling is more favored than the ps @xmath0 coupling for the @xmath46 reaction and the @xmath47 scattering at low energies .",
    "therefore , the pv coupling has been also used for the @xmath1 reaction as a matter of course .",
    "recently , drechsel et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out in the study of the @xmath46 reaction that the ps coupling was needed to describe the data with the increase of the incident photon energy .",
    "this implies that the ps coupling is preferable to the pv coupling at larger off - shell nucleon momenta .",
    "accordingly the ps coupling is expected to be important for the two - pion photoproduction , since the far off - shell nucleon is involved in the intermediate state .    in order to demonstrate the importance of the ps coupling and",
    "compare our theory with the data , we constructed two types of models ( ps and pv models ) by adding the vector meson contributions for the non - resonant processes ( fig.2 ) as well as the @xmath43 and @xmath2 contributions for the resonant processes ( fig.5 ) to the non - resonant contributions coming from the @xmath0 couplings ( fig.1 ) . using these models , we calculated the total cross sections , invariant mass spectra and helicity - dependent cross sections for various isospin channels .",
    "generally , these observables are successfully described by the ps model compared with the pv model except some details .",
    "particularly the calculations of total cross sections and invariant mass spectra for the @xmath275 and @xmath6 channels by the ps model are in good agreement with the data and on the other hand those by the pv model are largely underestimated .",
    "there are some discrepancies between the calculations with the ps model and the data in the invariant mass spectra for the @xmath20 channel .",
    "because the magnitude of the cross section in this channel is very small , the higher order processes might emerge in the detailed structure .",
    "therefore , we think , it may be necessary to investigate the mechanism originating with the @xmath15 meson and the final state interaction which are not taken into account in our model . although there are still unsatisfactory points , we conclude that the ps coupling certainly plays an important role in the two - pion photoproduction , especially , the @xmath29 and @xmath289 channels .",
    "now we would like to make some remarks about our model .",
    "first , the difference between the ps and pv couplings prominently appears in the neutral pion productions such as @xmath290 and @xmath23 reactions .",
    "this is understood from the fact that it stems from the anomalous magnetic moment term in the @xmath54 coupling ( eq.([gnn ] ) ) @xcite .",
    "in fact the difference disappears if @xmath59 is set to zero . in our model , @xmath59 is taken to be the on - shell value .",
    "it would be interesting to find out the influence of the off - shell effects in the @xmath54 vertex for the two - pion photoproduction and furthermore to know how the ps coupling at high photon energies is connected to the pv coupling at low energies in terms of the off - shellness of the intermediate nucleon .",
    "we note that the off - shell structure of the @xmath54 vertex appears as the modification of the anomalous magnetic moment term@xcite .",
    "secondly , the resonant processes in the present model have been treated in a naive way .",
    "the strong coupling constants for the @xmath2 resonance are determined from its total width and the branching ratios given in particle data group@xciteand their form factor ranges are assumed to be consistent with the nucleon size in quark models .",
    "the electromagnetic couplings of the @xmath2 to nucleon are taken from the pdg and their values are real number . in order to investigate the role of the resonance in detail ,",
    "the theory must be refined so as to describe three reactions , i.e. , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath291 , simultaneously .",
    "for instance , the effective coupling constant of @xmath292 becomes complex due to the interference with the background process , although its effect is not expected to be large because of the small imaginary number@xcite .",
    "finally , we have not included the @xmath30 resonant process in our model .",
    "nacher et al.@xcitehave pointed out that the @xmath30 resonance has a significant contribution on the @xmath1 reaction cross section due to the strong interference between the @xmath30 resonant process and the @xmath16 kroll - ruderman process although the contribution of only the @xmath30 resonant process is almost negligible .",
    "they used the real @xmath293 coupling constant given in pdg like the @xmath2 resonance in our model .",
    "however , it was predicted in the phenomenological analysis of the @xmath46 reaction@xcite that its imaginary part was comparable to its real part , which is quite different from the case of the @xmath294 coupling .",
    "this complex coupling constant , if used , should largely influence the results of ref.@xcite about the interference effect .",
