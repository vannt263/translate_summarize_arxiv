    "the large energy of almost 2 gev released in nucleon - antinucleon annihilation had awoken hopes to observe some unique nuclear reactions induced in this way .",
    "especially energetic antiprotons were presumed to reach the deep interior of the nucleus .",
    "exotic processes , like phase transitions to quark - gluon plasma and explosive decay of that hot system had been expected to occur @xcite , but were not verified in experiments performed shortly after the commissioning of the low energy antiproton ring at cern @xcite . nevertheless , the character of the reactions starting with antiproton absorption in nuclei is quite unique in comparison with reactions induced with protons or heavy ions . whereas the excitation energy carried in by post - annihilation mesons is quite large , the linear and angular momentum transfer as well as the matter compression are reduced , particularly in the stopped antiproton case which is preceded by the exotic atom phase .",
    "hence , one may investigate a clear thermal reaction aspects with suppressed collective motion complications .",
    "such phenomena were intensively studied during the lear era for stopped and for energetic antiprotons .",
    "the spectra for neutrons and light charged particles @xcite , mass yield distributions @xcite and characteristics of the fission fragments @xcite were measured for a wide range of targets . the mean excitation energy derived from these studies , @xmath5 150 mev and",
    "@xmath5 300 mev for heavy nuclei absorbing stopped and 1.2 gev antiprotons , respectively , compares well with the average values obtained for protons which have about 1 gev larger energies , i.e. approximately the nucleon rest mass .",
    "yield distributions of residual nuclei were studied as soon as more intense @xmath8 beams were provided by lear .",
    "many targets were irradiated with antiprotons , mainly at rest energy , but only few of them were examined in detail : @xmath9cu @xcite , @xmath10mo @xcite , @xmath11mo @xcite , @xmath9ag @xcite , @xmath9ba @xcite , @xmath12ho @xcite and @xmath13ta @xcite .",
    "average quantities such as the mean mass removed from the target as well as individual yield features , e.g. isomeric ratios , were investigated .",
    "clear odd - even effects in the mass and charge yield distribution were observed .",
    "theoretical calculations , based on intranuclear cascade + evaporation models , were able to reproduce only the gross features and failed to predict yield dependence on the detailed @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the odd - even phenomenon , although postulated to be present and used to model the yield distribution for years @xcite and sometimes reaching very large values @xcite , still seems to be almost completely unexplored theoretically in a more quantitative way .",
    "one of the most distinct features observed in reactions with stopped antiprotons is the large probability ( @xmath5 0.1 ) of very small energy transfer , when the target nucleus looses only one nucleon in annihilation and is left excited below the nucleon separation energy .",
    "nuclear spectroscopy studies of the relative yield of both types of these residual ( @xmath14 ) nuclei ( a neutron or a proton lost in such soft antiproton absorptions ) were used to establish a new and powerful method of probing the nuclear periphery composition @xcite .",
    "the irradiation of the heavy , gold target gave us a chance to study the competition between evaporation and fission induced by antiproton absorption .",
    "the yield distribution of heavy residual nuclei complements the results obtained from on - line measurements of neutron and charged particle spectra @xcite .",
    "since gold is a commonly used target , there was also the opportunity to compare these data with a rich set of information gathered from irradiations with energetic protons or pions .",
    "in particular , the yield distribution after the reaction of 1 gev protons with au has been extensively studied in older and recent @xmath0-ray spectroscopy measurements @xcite and also with a new method using the mass - charge spectrometry for inverse kinematic reactions @xcite .",
    "our preliminary data of the reaction @xmath15 + au at rest were already published @xcite , this work presents the complete results obtained after fitting the @xmath16 yield distribution .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : experiment ] we briefly present some details of the experiment , in sec .  [",
    "sec : analysis ] data analysis is described together with the yield fitting method .",

    "a thick target of natural gold was irradiated with the antiproton beam of 200 mev / c momentum from lear facility .",
    "the target of the total thickness of 549 mg/@xmath17 was composed of ten foils of 80 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 2 , 30 , 30 , 37 , 80 and 200 mg/@xmath17 , starting from the beam side .",
    "the initial energy of the antiprotons , equal to about 21 mev , was reduced in the scintillation counter ( from pilot b ) and in some additional moderators ( mylar , silicon ) to about 6.5 mev at the target surface . such an arrangement",
    "assured that the majority of antiprotons was stopped in few central au foils .",
    "the very central and extremely thin foil of 2 mg/@xmath17 was applied to monitor the x - ray activity , while the last and thickest one ( 200 mg/@xmath17 ) was used to check the secondary reactions level .    two scintillation counters , s1 and s2 , were used to control beam intensity and transverse dispersion .",
    "the first anticounter s1 had a hole of 10 mm diameter and the active area of counter s2 was a disc of the same diameter .",
    "consequently the signal @xmath18 indicated particles going towards the target .",
    "the irradiation lasted 15 minutes with the total number of antiprotons equal to @xmath19 ( @xmath18 number ) .",
    "monitoring of the target activity started 13 min after the irradiation and continued at cern during one week ; afterwards the spectra were collected in warsaw , the last one was taken more than a year after target activation .",
    "two hpge detectors were used at cern , a @xmath0-ray counter of 15% relative efficiency for all foils and an x - ray counter for the thinest one . in warsaw",
    "two more efficient @xmath0-ray detectors were applied , of 20% and of 60% relative efficiency , and a third x - ray detector for the thin foil .",
    "all collected spectra were analyzed with the program activ @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray lines were identified by their energies , half - lives and intensity ratios .",
    "the decay data were taken from the eighth edition of the table of isotopes @xcite .",
    "experimental yields for all detected residual nuclei , normalized to 1000 @xmath15 stopped in the target , are listed in table [ yields ] .",
    "the independent yields represent the total number of nuclei , summed over all isomers .",
    "cumulative yields include also the yields of all @xmath20-decay precursors of a given isotope . besides that",
    ", there are presented partial yields for some isomers not representing the whole production for a given ( a , z ) pair as well as some production limits for hg nuclei .",
    "mercury may be produced from gold after @xmath8 absorption in a charge exchange reactions , when one of the annihilation @xmath21 pions exchanges charge with a target neutron .",
    "such a phenomenon was observed for some targets irradiated with stopped antiprotons @xcite , where nuclei of target charge plus one were produced at level ranging from 0.5 to 5 per 1000 @xmath8 . on the other hand , for some other targets , studied in the neutron halo project , rather low upper limits ( 0.5 - 2% )",
    "were given @xcite .",
    "our data obtained for au , except for the @xmath22hg isomers with low @xmath0 intensity , indicate that such an effect should happen very rarely .",
    "initially , the distribution of the activity induced in individual target foils was estimated several hours after the irradiation with the use of the measurement of the @xmath23 yield in each foil .",
    "five inner foils ( 30 , 30 , 2 , 30 , 30 mg/@xmath17 ) gathered about 90% of the total activity and only these foils were monitored later .",
    "this reduced the @xmath0-ray self - absorption effect .",
    "the distribution of the target activity was determined more precisely afterwards on the basis of yields obtained for six evaporation residues : @xmath24ir , @xmath25ir , @xmath26os , @xmath13re , @xmath27dy and @xmath28dy . on average ,",
    "five inner foils stopped ( @xmath29)% of the whole number of antiprotons .",
    "these data , together with the results for @xmath30au and @xmath31au , were used also to estimate the yield introduced by secondary reactions with particles ( mainly pions and neutrons ) produced after antiproton annihilation on target nuclei .",
    "it was done by comparing the number of given nuclei produced per foil thickness unit , averaged for three inner foils , with the similar result obtained for the last , thickest foil .",
    "the upper limit for the secondary reactions leading to @xmath30au is equal to 3% , the limit for @xmath31au is about 2.6% and for the rest of quoted isotopes it does not exceed 2% , i.e. in all cases it is below the yield uncertainties .",
    "the negligible influence of the secondary reactions on our results is additionally confirmed by very small upper limit given in table [ yields ] for @xmath32au , a ( n,@xmath0 ) reaction product .",

    "this was done by fixing some parameters when the others were fitted , and vice versa .",
    "various combinations and order of fixing / releasing of parameters as well as their total number were tested .",
    "the shape of the mass ridge could be parametrized with a maximum of four parameters , the most probable @xmath7 path was approximated via a parabola except for two cases and the charge distribution width was constant or changed linearly with mass .",
    "odd - even corrections were applied only for three heaviest mass regions , where a larger number of points and smaller relative errors of the experimental data allowed to get a reliable fit .",
    "the shape of the charge distributions was modeled better with the use of an asymmetric form for the evaporation residues , lying further from the stability valley ( see fig .",
    "[ aust_map ] ) . for lighter , fission products",

    "the compilation of the measured particle emission @xcite gives 5.4 nucleons ejected in the cascade+preequilibrium stages through n , p , d , t , @xmath147he and @xmath148he ejectiles .",
    "hence we have on the average 14.6 evaporated nucleons and assuming 8 mev separation energy and 3 mev kinetic energy per nucleon @xcite leads to ( @xmath149 ) mev stored in the thermalized system .",
    "such a result compares nicely with the value of ( @xmath150 ) mev derived from the measurements of the spectra of neutrons and of light charged particles @xcite .",
    "data on odd - even and shell effects observed in the @xmath16 yield distribution are rather rarely discussed in the yield modeling context @xcite .",
    "their influence on the yields is difficult to observe if the experimental data set is limited and errors are of the order of the possible odd - even correction .",
    "the conclusion of rudstam @xcite , looking for a general formula predicting cross sections for p and @xmath151 induced reactions , was that there is no need to introduce such a correction as the experiment / model yield ratios for various n and z combinations do not show any clear correlation with the nucleon number evenness .",
    "later , silberberg and tsao @xcite found a moderate effect , modeled with factors equal to 1.25 , 0.9 , 1.0 and 0.85 for even - even , odd - n , odd - z and odd - odd ( n , z ) pairs , respectively .    since off - line nuclear spectroscopy was applied to study the @xmath16 distribution the odd - even effect was observed in reactions induced with stopped antiprotons @xcite .",
    "results for lighter targets ( @xmath152mo , @xmath9ba ) are consistent , with an 18 - 26 % correction for odd - z nuclei and a 32 - 34 % correction for odd - n nuclei ( and the sum of these values in the odd - odd case ) .",
    "corresponding values fitted for @xmath12ho @xcite are not so evident , the yield of odd",
    "- n nuclei is strongly reduced ( by @xmath5 66% ) whereas there is no need to correct the odd - z results . because these fits were made simultaneously for the whole heavy residue region , no dependence on the emitted number of nucleons ( hence excitation ) was studied , also no indication for any shell effects",
    "was reported .        using the heavy and fissionable gold nuclei to absorb antiprotons we have the opportunity to investigate the odd - even and shell effects in a wide evaporation and fission products mass range . in fig .",
    "[ aust_dis ] we present three fitted yield distributions , as function of mass , charge and neutron number of the products .",
    "corrections fitted for odd - n and odd - z yield were shown in table [ parameters ] with parameters @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "they seem to be largest for the medium @xmath146 region ( @xmath155 ) , since between the heavier residues only the odd - n pt isotopes exhibit a clear yield reduction of about 30% . a small odd - n effect",
    "( @xmath156 10% ) seems also to appear for the other heavy even - z products .",
    "lighter evaporation residues are produced more uniformly over changing nucleon numbers evenness , although for products close to the closed @xmath157 shell ( @xmath158 ) the even - n isotopes are strongly favored .",
    "we have not been able to study odd - even effects for the lightest evaporation and all fission products because of their small cross sections with large relative uncertainties and since the experimental data are there much less numerous .",
    "it should be stated that the correction for odd - odd nuclei used here slightly differs from those applied before for stopped antiprotons @xcite as we use the multiplicative form ( eq .",
    "( [ charge ] ) ) instead of a correction factor equal to @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are parameters fitted for odd - n and odd - z nuclei , respectively .",
    "since we observe that the odd - even effect is stronger when both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are odd or even , the multiplication is more adequate .",
    "the use of odd - even corrections for stopped antiproton reactions strongly improves the fit , with @xmath138 reduction by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "thus it can not be treated as a trivial improvement via adding another parameter .",
    "moreover , since corrections obtained for different mass regions are consistent , therefore , taking into account previous results obtained for lighter targets @xcite the inclusion of such a component is unavoidable in correct modeling of the data coming from experiments with stopped antiprotons .",
    "its strength , more pronounced than in the corresponding energetic proton data at 800 mev @xcite , is one of the most distinct features of the antiproton absorption induced reactions .",
    "the independent and/or cumulative yields for 114 isotopes produced after absorption of stopped antiprotons in gold were measured by using the off - line @xmath0-ray spectroscopy technique . on this basis , with the help of a phenomenological model , the whole yield distribution was extracted for residues ranging from the target mass minus one down to the light fission products with mass @xmath162 20 .",
    "the fission probability was estimated to be ( @xmath3)% , in agreement with the results of measurements using on - line techniques .",
    "an average thermal excitation energy , gained by the au nucleus after @xmath8 annihilation , was shown to be quite similar to that of 1 gev protons , although the fission probability for such protons is almost twice as large . moreover",
    ", the inspection of the yield distribution over the @xmath1-@xmath7 plane indicates a fairly peculiar character of the reaction induced with low energy antiprotons .",
    "the most probable @xmath7 course is quite different , lying closer to the stability line and exhibiting a more complex shape .",
    "furthermore , the charge dispersion over @xmath7 does not compare with that observed for 0.8 gev protons , being almost twice as narrow .",
    "the average mass removal observed for various targets reacting with stopped antiprotons rises linearly with increasing target mass .",
    "this behavior is consistent with in - beam studies of the light particle emission .",
    "@xmath146 derived from mass yield data helps to complete such measurements , unable to detect charged particles of the lowest energy .",
    "a clear odd - even and some shell effects distinguish evidently the reaction with stopped antiproton from those induced with energetic protons .",
    "for the first time the dependence of this phenomenon on the residue mass was studied .",
    "the strength of such effects seems to diminish with the excitation energy , although for long evaporation chains and fission products it may be unobserved due to scarce and uncertain data ."
