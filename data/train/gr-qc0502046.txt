    "the holographic principle in field theory states that , in the presence of gravity , physics in a region of space - time can be encoded on a lower - dimensional surface .",
    "the maldacena @xmath0 conjecture @xcite provides explicit examples for some of these holographic encodings .",
    "for example , iib string theory on the background @xmath1 or @xmath2theory on the background @xmath3 are claimed to be mathematically equivalent ( dual ) to certain quantum field theories on the boundary at infinity of the relevant @xmath4 space .",
    "the isometry groups of the @xmath4 spaces become conformal groups acting on the boundary quantum theories . in the case of @xmath5 ,",
    "the quantum field theory is @xmath6 super yang - mills gauge theory with gauge group @xmath7 and coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "this particular yang - mills theory is also a conformal field theory @xmath9 .    more specifically , if one introduces a generating function for correlation functions of operators @xmath10 in the yang - mills theory , then the @xmath0 correspondence states that @xcite , @xmath11.\\ ] ] in this equation , on the left - hand side , we have the generating function with operators integrated against arbitrary density functions , @xmath12 , on the boundary of @xmath4 .",
    "the boundary has dimension @xmath13 according to the version of the correspondence we consider .",
    "the function @xmath14 $ ] is the string partition function with string coupling @xmath15 , evaluated in the @xmath4 background .",
    "the fields , @xmath16 , satisfy the boundary conditions of approaching @xmath12 at infinity .",
    "a limit can be taken to reduce the string theory to its supergravity limit .",
    "this may be done by a combination of taking the string tension to infinity @xmath17 and sending @xmath18 .",
    "a second limit is obtained by making the approximation @xmath19 of the supergravity partition function to @xmath20 , where the supergravity action @xmath21 $ ] is the action of the classical supergavity solution that satisfies the boundary conditions mentioned above .",
    "although the strongest form of the correspondence is the string theory expression , in practice it is much easier to work with supergravity actions , and it is for this reason that most results have been obtained in this context . on the quantum field theory side of the correspondence , this approximation amounts to taking both @xmath22 and @xmath23 large .",
    "the classical supergravity action should holographically capture the large-@xmath22 limit of strongly coupled quantum yang - mills theory .",
    "a quite large amount of work has been produced in the last few years on the @xmath0 conjecture and an extensive introduction can be found in @xcite . in the @xmath0 correspondence",
    ", the study of @xmath4 black holes has a direct interpretation in terms of the dual conformal field theory on its boundary .",
    "the duality predicts that the retarded @xmath24 correlation functions are in one to one correspondence with green s functions on anti - de sitter space with appropriate boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in @xcite , it is assumed that a large static black hole in @xmath4 space corresponds to a thermal state in the @xmath24 on the boundary .",
    "perturbing the black hole with a scalar field , for instance , is equivalent to perturbing this thermal state .",
    "the perturbed system is expected , at late times , to approach equilibrium exponentially with a characteristic time - scale .",
    "this time - scale is inversely proportional to the imaginary part of the poles of the correlators of the perturbation operator .",
    "it seems that these relaxation time - scales are quite complicated to calculate in the @xmath24 , therefore their computation is conveniently replaced by the evaluation of the quasinormal frequencies in the @xmath4 bulk space .    in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors went beyond the scalar perturbation treated in @xcite and they considered electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations . in one of the most recent works on the subject , berti and kokkotas @xcite confirm and extend previous results on scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of static @xmath4 black holes and analyse , for the first time , reissner - nordstrom anti - de sitter black holes and calculate their quasinormal frequencies .",
    "naturally , perturbations associated with other kinds of fields than the scalars treated in @xcite will decay at different rates given by their quasinormal mode frequencies .",
    "quasinormal modes have recently become relevant to quantum gravity for a different reason .",
    "this arises from hod s proposal to describe quantum properties of black holes from their classical oscillation spectrum @xcite .",
    "the quest for a consistent quantization of black holes was initiated many years ago by bekenstein @xcite who , based on semi - classical arguments , conjectured that the horizon area of a ( non extremal ) black hole should have a discrete eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "the eigenvalues of this spectrum were expected to be uniformly spaced .",
    "hod noted that the real parts of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies of a static black hole of mass @xmath25 , as computed by nollert @xcite , can be written as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the black hole hawking s temperature .",
    "he then exploited bohr s correspondence principle , asserting that transition frequencies at large quantum numbers should equal classical oscillation frequencies , to conjecture that variations in the black hole mass due to quantum processes should be given by @xmath28 .",
    "finally , using the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the equivalence between entropy and the surface area , he deduced the equal spacing in the area spectrum of a static hole .",
    "hod s conjecture has brought further motivations in the field of black hole physics and has provoked several attempts to evaluate highly damped quasinormal frequencies of kerr black holes .",
    "it is , in fact , straightforward to ask whether this conjecture is valid for more general black holes than the static ones ; if asymptotic frequencies depend in these more general cases on black hole charge and/or angular momentum ; if the presence of a cosmological constant should imply a modification of the proposal . at the moment",
    "these ideas of universality in hod s proposal have not been confirmed @xcite .",
    "a brief outline of this paper is the following . in section",
    "[ two ] we review some of the main features of @xmath4 spacetime and its static and rotating black hole solutions . in section",
    "[ three ] we solve the radial teukolsky equation .",
    "then , we concentrate on the angular equation and propose both a second order and a pade approximation of the associated eigenvalues . in section iv we introduce transformation theory and obtain the regge - wheeler equation .",
    "these results are exploited for the explicit determination of the quasinormal frequencies and some considerations on their asymptotic spacing .",
    "all the numerical results are reported in section [ numres ] .",
    "we conclude by a final discussion of the results we have obtained and with some ideas for future work . in the appendix we give the explicit recurrence relation for the series solution of the radial teukolsky equation .",
    "rotating black holes in four dimensions with a cosmological constant were first constructed by carter @xcite and demianski @xcite . in the asymptotically de sitter case ,",
    "the black hole solutions have cosmological horizons .",
    "thermal equilibrium is only possible when the black hole horizon has the same temperature as the de sitter horizon@xcite .",

    "the quasinormal frequencies for rotating black holes show a behaviour which is very similar to the one found in the case of schwarzschild black holes @xcite .",
    "they have a real part which displays an increase along with the imaginary part .",
    "the spacing between consecutive modes tends to become regular as the overtone number @xmath285 gets larger , and it seems to depend on the angular parameter @xmath55 . since in @xmath4 space the first ten frequencies are usually enough to ascertain their asymptotic behaviour , we have computed the quasinormal frequencies for @xmath286 in the case of lbh , and @xmath287 in the case of ibh , up to the tenth mode .",

    "there have been investigations on @xmath4 black holes particularly focused on their thermodynamic properties since the beginning of the eighties @xcite .",
    "recently , anti - de sitter space has appeared in the surprising new context of the maldacena conjecture relating the physics of @xmath4 in @xmath295 dimensions to a strongly coupled conformal ( gauge ) field theory @xmath9 in one dimension fewer .",
    "this interest has led to the study of static , charged and rotating black holes in @xmath4 space in five and even seven dimensions , where the @xmath0 correspondence can be still formulated .",

    "large kerr @xmath4 black holes are stable against hawking evaporation .",

    "furthermore , kerr-@xmath4 black holes can have rotating killing vectors which are time - like everywhere outside the horizon . following the orbits of these rotating killing vectors",
    ", thermal radiation can rotate around the black hole with the same angular velocity of the hole , implying that the phenomenon known as super - radiance is not allowed , and the black hole is in thermal equilibrium with the thermal gas around it @xcite .",
    "although research has been carried on for a few years in the field of quasinormal modes of black holes in @xmath4 space and results have been obtained for schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrom black holes , it is in this work that for the first time that frequencies of kerr @xmath4 black holes are computed .",
    "the possibility is that , through the @xmath0 correspondence , such frequencies can be exploited in the calculation of the relaxation times of the perturbation of the corresponding thermal state in the conformal field theory on the boundary",
    ".    it would be desirable to analyse the kerr @xmath4 black holes in deeper detail and see how the frequencies relate to the thermodynamical properties of the black holes and whether there is a direct interpretation in terms of the @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to look for special behaviour along the phase transition line and to examine the non - axisymmetric case to find out what happens to the super radiant modes .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , although black hole solutions in higher dimensions than @xmath296 have been found @xcite , the calculation of their quasinormal frequencies has never been done .",
    "therefore an extension of our work to @xmath297 and @xmath298 , where the @xmath0 correspondence can be still formulated , seems possible .",
    "finally , it would be perhaps of some interest to further check if the ideas on black hole area quantisation and the relationship to highly damped quasinormal frequencies , can be translated into non - asymptotically flat spacetimes , as anti - de sitter space .",
    "in this appendix we describe in details how to derive the recurrence relation of the series solution @xmath130 for the radial teukolsky equation associated to spin-@xmath299 perturbations of kerr anti - de sitter black holes .    starting from equation [ c430 ] for @xmath130 , we can write its derivatives with respect to @xmath116 as @xmath300 we re - write eq .
