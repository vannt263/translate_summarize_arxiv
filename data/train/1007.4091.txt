    "the idea of topological quantum computation as a way to incorporate fault tolerence at the hardware level has been getting a lot of attention recently @xcite . in this scheme",
    ", qubits are non - abelian anyons and the braiding operations on them implement quantum gates .",
    "one of the simplest class of non - abelian anyons are realised in systems with unpaired majorana fermions ( umf ) @xcite . in a fermionic system with @xmath2",
    "zero energy modes , there are @xmath4 majorana modes . if these @xmath4 modes can be independently moved around each other , then the geometric phases picked up correspond to a non - abelian representation of the braid group .",
    "thus it is of interest to study physically realisable systems where umf exist and can be manipulated .",
    "non - abelian anyons are theoretically predicted to occur in certain fractional quantum hall states like @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "there is also theoretical work showing how they could be realised in quantum circuits @xcite . in this context",
    ", kitaev presented a remarkable solvable spin-1/2 model on a honeycomb lattice @xcite which realises non - abelian anyons made up of umf .",
    "the model can be written in terms of majorana fermions in the background of @xmath3 gauge fields .",
    "this fermionisation procedure is very similar to that proposed in the context of the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) theory @xcite .",
    "the crucial difference is that in kitaev s honeycomb model , the gauge fields are constants of motion , hence the rvb type mean field theory is exact and the problem reduces to solving a theory of non - interacting majorana fermions in the background of static @xmath3 gauge field configurations .",
    "kitaev showed that the ground state is the flux free configuration .",
    "the model has a phase which is characterised by a topological invariant , the chern number , being equal to @xmath6 . in this phase",
    "there are umf trapped to each vortex ( a @xmath3 flux ) .",
    "thus if vortices can be created and manipulated , it is possible to braid the umf .",
    "however , the @xmath3 flux operator is a 6-spin operator and thus may not be easy to realise in practice .",
    "kitaev s honeycomb model can be generalised to a variety of other lattices .",
    "it can be constructed on any lattice with coordination number three , if all the bonds can be coloured using three colours .",
    "it has been shown that all such models can be realised in cold atom systems @xcite and using quantum circuits @xcite .",
    "in paper we present a one dimensional generalisation of kitaev s honeycomb model which we call the tetrahedral chain ( tc ) and analyse its zero energy modes in detail .",
    "one dimensional models with umf at the edges have been studied earlier @xcite .",
    "the new feature of the tc is that the wavefunctions of the umf not necessarily peaked at the edges of the chain but can be peaked anywhere in the bulk .",
    "as we will show , they are trapped to kink and anti - kink flux configurations and can be moved by tuning the flux configuration .",
    "further , by tuning the coupling constants , their wavefunctions , which we obtain analytically , can also be tuned .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ tmod ]",
    "we present the model and its conserved quantities .",
    "section [ jwt ] describes the jordan - wigner transformation which enables us to rewrite the theory in terms of majorana fermions hopping in the background of static @xmath3 gauge field configurations .",

    "the dependence of the gap as a function of the couplings is computed in section [ gs ] and a gapless line in the parameter space is identified .",
    "section [ zmk ] contains a detailed analysis of the zero - modes of the majorana fermions .",
    "we summarise our results and discuss them in the conluding section [ concl ] .",
    "and @xmath7 bonds are as indicated . ]    the chain we define our model on is shown in fig .",
    "[ thkc1 ] . there are four sites per unit cell which are labelled as shown in the figure .",
    "the hamiltonian is , @xmath8    there are two triangular plaquettes in each unit cell and a conserved @xmath3 flux associated with each of them .",
    "the flux operators are , @xmath9 as in kitaev s honeycomb model , these quantities are conserved as a consequence of a local spin rotation symmetry of the model .",
    "namely , a @xmath10 rotation on each site of a plaquette about the direction of the outgoing bond .",
    "apart from these local conserved quantities there are also three global qauntities which are conserved as a consequence the fact that a global @xmath10 rotation about each of the three axes is a symmetry of the model .",
    "we denote these by , @xmath11 it can be verified that @xmath12 is the product of the fluxes of all the plaquettes , @xmath13",
    "we express the hamiltonian in terms of majorana fermions using the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "we choose the jordan - wigner path to go along the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 bonds from left to right . at every site we have two bonds that are tangential to the path .",
    "we denote the incoming bond by @xmath16 .",
    "this is the @xmath14-bond on the sublatttices 1 , 3 and @xmath15-bond on sublattices 2,4 .",
    "the outgoing bond , corresponding to @xmath15 on sublattices 1,3 and @xmath14 on sublattices 2,4 , is denoted by @xmath17 . the third bond on each site which in normal to the path is denoted by @xmath18 with the sign defined by @xmath19 . with our choice of path , the normal bond is @xmath7 for sublattices 1,3 and @xmath20 for sublattices 2,4 .    with these definitions the two majorana fermions at each site are defined as , @xmath21 the hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the majorana fermions defined above , @xmath22 where the link fields , @xmath23 are defined as , @xmath24 it is easy to see that the link fields are conserved quantities .",
    "thus , as expected for a generalised kitaev model , the theory gets written in terms of majorana fermions with nearest neighbour hopping in the background of conserved @xmath3 gauge fields with the gauge fixing condition that the gauge fields on the @xmath14 and @xmath15 bonds are equal to @xmath25 .",
    "it is easy to check that in this gauge the two flux operators are proportional to the link fields , @xmath26    it is instructive to express the three global conserved quantities , @xmath27 in terms of the fermionic variables .",
    "we have , @xmath28 we will refer to @xmath12 as the flux number and @xmath29 as the majorana number .",
    "the hamiltonian can be diagonalised in the standard way .",
    "we write the eigenstates as direct products of states in the @xmath30 fermion sector , @xmath31 , which we will refer to as the gauge sector and states in the @xmath32 fermion sector , @xmath33 , which we call the matter sector .",
    "we choose the states in the gauge sector to be the simultaneous eigenstates of the @xmath3 flux operators , i.e @xmath34 , where @xmath35",
    "we then have @xmath36\\vert{\\cal m}\\rangle \\vert\\{w^l_i , w^r_i\\}\\rangle= h\\left[w^l_i , w^r_i\\right]\\vert{\\cal m}\\rangle \\vert\\{w^l_i , w^r_i\\}\\rangle\\ ] ] the problem reduces to finding the eigenstates of the quadratic hamiltonan of the @xmath32 fermions in the background of the gauge field configuration @xmath37 .",
    "the normal modes are given by the solution of the eigenvalue equation , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a purely imaginary anti - symmetric matrix , @xmath40    the eigenvalues come in pairs , @xmath41 .",
    "so we can always choose @xmath42 to be positive .",
    "the eigenvectors corresponding to the positive and negative eigenvalues are complex conjugates . denoting the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvectors as @xmath43",
    ", we expand the @xmath32 fermions as , @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 are also majorana fermions .",
    "the diagonal form of the hamiltonian is then , @xmath47 the ground state energy is the one where all the operators @xmath48 are diagonal and equal to -1 .",
    "the ground state energy is , @xmath49      we will be analysing the system with periodic ( pbc ) and open boundary conditions ( obc ) .",
    "the latter case is straightforward .",
    "the fermionic hamiltonian is exactly of the form given in equation ( [ ham2 ] ) with @xmath50 , where @xmath2 is the number of unit cells .",
    "the fermionic modes have to be solved with the boundary conditions @xmath51    pbc is a little more subtle .",
    "as is standard in jordan - wigner transformations , the term in the hamiltonian for the link @xmath52 to @xmath53 is , @xmath54 @xmath55 is a conserved quantity and can hence be chosen to be diagonal .",
    "the fermionic modes have to be solved with periodic boundary conditions for states with @xmath56 and with anti - periodic boundary conditions for states with @xmath57 .",
    "namely , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the eigenvalue of @xmath55 .",
    "we have solved eigenvalue problem numerically for a chain with @xmath2 unit cells and open boundary conditions for @xmath60 .",
    "each unit cell has 4 possible flux configurations making a total of @xmath61 .",
    "we computed the single particle spectrum for each flux configuration and calculated the lowest total energy state for the range of values @xmath62 ( in the steps of 0.2 ) .",
    "we find that the ground state is @xmath63 fold degenerate for all values of the parameters .",
    "this denegeracy comes from the fact that the single particle spectrum depends only on the values of the product , @xmath64 , and not on their individual values .",
    "i.e the spectrum only sees the total flux passing through each unit cell which is the product of the values of the fluxes passing through the two triangular plaquettes that make up the unit cell .",
    "the ground states correspond to the translationally invariant , @xmath65 , flux configurations .",
    "as mentioned above , we find that the spectrum in each sector is @xmath63 fold degenerate . this degeneracy is due to the fact that the energy eigenvalues depend only on the total flux in the unit cell , namely @xmath64 and not on the individual fluxes , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the remaining part of this section",
    ", we will give an analytic proof of this @xmath63 fold degeneracy of all the states .",
    "this degeneracy is related to but not the same as the @xmath61 degeneracy that occurs in the simple kitaev chain , the @xmath68 limit of our model . in this case",
    "the degeneracy is easy to understand .",
    "the gauge fields do not occur at all in the hamiltonian .",
    "thus each state is @xmath61 degenerate corresponding to all the states in the gauge sector .",
    "the extra @xmath7-bond terms in our model lift this degeneracy only partially .    at @xmath69",
    ", the denegeracy can be understood in terms of a local symmetry .",
    "it consists of interchanging the spins at sublattice 2 and 3 in any unit cell and then performing a @xmath70 rotation about the @xmath14-axis on all the spins in that unit cell .",
    "the operator that implements this transformation is , @xmath71 it is easy to verify that the @xmath72 s commute with the hamiltonian , however @xmath72 flips the sign of the two flux operators in the unit cell , @xmath73 thus it changes the flux configuration while conserving the total flux through the unit cell . since it also does not change the energy eigenvalue",
    ", it follows that every eigenstate of the hamiltonian is @xmath63 fold degenerate .    however , we numerically observe that the degeneracy persists even when @xmath74",
    ". we will now give a proof for the degeneracy which is valid at all couplings .",
    "we note that in equation ( [ nmeq ] ) , @xmath75 and @xmath76 couple only to sites within the unit cell . we express them in terms of @xmath77 and @xmath78 and",
    "obtain an eigenvalue equation for these quantities .",
    "we are then able to show that the eigenvalues depend only on @xmath79 .",
    "we define the two component column vectors , @xmath80 and the matrices , @xmath81 the eigenvalue equations ( [ nmeq ] ) can be written as , @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath84 can be eliminated from the equations to get , @xmath85 the equations can be explicitly written as , @xmath86 where , @xmath87 when these equations are solved for @xmath88 , they will yield an equation for @xmath89 .",
    "we now make a transformation , @xmath90 this gets rid of the phases in equations ( [ chieq2 ] ) and ( [ chieq3 ] ) which become , @xmath91 since @xmath92 depends only on @xmath79 and not on @xmath66 and @xmath67 individually , @xmath88 and hence @xmath89 depends only on the @xmath79 .",
    "thus the energy eigenvalues depend only on the total flux passing through the unit cell .",
    "this result is true for all values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "note that when @xmath68 , equation ( [ cdef ] ) implies that @xmath92 is independent of @xmath79 also .",
    "thus the @xmath61 fold degeneracy of the simple kitaev chain is recovered in this limit .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier our numerical results show that the translationally invariant fluxes through the unit cells , namely @xmath65 is one of the ground states of the model .",
    "the fermionic problem is easy to solve analytically for these flux configurations and therefore the energy of the @xmath95 configuration can be compared to that of the @xmath96 configuration in the thermodynamic limit .    if @xmath97 , then @xmath92 in equations ( [ chieq4 ] , [ chieq5 ] ) are independent of @xmath98 , @xmath99",
    ". the equations can be solved by fourier transforms , @xmath100 @xmath88 is then given by the eigenvalues of the following matrix , @xmath101 namely , @xmath102 along with equation ( [ lamdef ] ) this yields an equation for the four energy bands .",
    "we have solved for this energy bands and have computed the gap for @xmath103 and @xmath104 .     for @xmath104 and values of @xmath94 varying in the range @xmath105 .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath106 region is gapless for some value of @xmath94 . ]",
    "the calculations confirm that the @xmath107 sector has a lower ground state energy than the @xmath108 sector .",
    "the fermionic gap is twice the value of the lowest single particle energy eigenvalue .",
    "this is shown in figure [ gapvsjy ] where the gap is plotted against @xmath109 for different values of @xmath94 .",
    "the @xmath106 region is clearly gapless .",
    "it is interesting that when we plot the gap as a function of @xmath110 , all the points fall on the straight line as shown in fig .",
    "[ gapvsj ] . this can be shown analytically since the expression in equation ( [ cdef ] ) simplifies considerably at @xmath65 .",
    "it is then easy to show that the energy eigenvalues are given by , @xmath111 the gap is thus given by , @xmath112 the circle in the parameter space , @xmath113 is therefore gapless .    .",
    "the points fall on straight lines with slopes @xmath114",
    "we will now analyse the zero energy modes of the majorana fermions . when @xmath115 , we have @xmath116 and hence the equations ( [ chieq4 ] ) and ( [ chieq5 ] ) decouple and become very simple , @xmath117 these recursion relations can be formally solved , @xmath118 where @xmath119 are arbitrary constants .",
    "thus , there are two formal solutions for every set of values of the parameters and every flux configuration",
    ". one with @xmath120 and @xmath121 which we denote by @xmath122 and the other with @xmath123 and @xmath124 which we denote by @xmath125 .",
    "however , the boundary conditions that the modes have to satisfy will pick out certain flux configurations for each point in the parameter space .",
    "we will analyse the situation for the cases of periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and open boundary conditions ( obc ) .",
    "we consider a chain with @xmath2 unit cells .",
    "as discussed in equation ( [ apbc ] ) , pbc will imply that , @xmath126    equations ( [ phi1sol ] ) , ( [ phi4sol ] ) and ( [ pbc ] ) imply @xmath127 consider the general case where @xmath128 of the @xmath79 s are equal to @xmath129 and @xmath130 of them are @xmath25",
    ". we will refer to such configurations as @xmath131-defect configurations .",
    "equation ( [ pbccond1 ] ) gets written as , @xmath132 when @xmath133 , we have only have solutions on the circle of radius @xmath134 in the @xmath135 plane .",
    "note that @xmath133 is the translationally invariant ground state flux configuration .",
    "thus this result implies that the model is gapless only on the circle , consistent with equation ( [ lingap ] ) .",
    "when @xmath136 , since the lhs of equation ( [ pbccond2 ] ) is less than @xmath137 , no zero modes exist within the circle of radius @xmath134 . outside this circle , for every even @xmath131",
    "there are two directions where equation ( [ pbccond2 ] ) is satisfied with @xmath138 .",
    "one direction where @xmath139 and the other where @xmath140 .",
    "for odd @xmath131 , the @xmath139 solution exists for @xmath138 and the @xmath141 solution for @xmath142 .",
    "thus for every @xmath2 there are a discrete set of points outside the circle which support zero energy modes . in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath143",
    ", @xmath144 can take all values from @xmath137 to @xmath145 . in this limit , all the points outside the circle in the range , @xmath146 support zero energy modes .",
    "this region is shown for @xmath104 in fig .",
    "[ zmr ]     plane at @xmath104 that supports zero energy modes ]    consider the cases when the @xmath131 defects are in adjoining unit cells , say from @xmath53 to @xmath147 .",
    "we will call this a kink - antikink configuration .",
    "we define polar coordinates in the @xmath135 plane , @xmath148 the unnormalised wave functions of the two zero modes are , @xmath149 @xmath150 and @xmath151 are given in terms of @xmath152 and @xmath153 , @xmath154    it can be seen that @xmath122 is peaked at @xmath147 and is minimum at @xmath53 whereas @xmath125 is peaked at @xmath53 and has a minmum at @xmath147",
    ". thus we have one majorana mode localised at the location of the kink and another at the location of the antikink .",
    "when @xmath131 is large these are well separated .",
    "thus the situation is similar to kitaev s honeycomb model with kinks and antikinks playing the role of the vortices .",
    "if the flux configuration can be manipulated , then so can the majorana modes trapped to them .       with open boundary conditions .",
    "]    we now consider open chains with @xmath2 unit cells .",
    "we then need to solve equations ( [ zm1 ] ) and ( [ zm4 ] ) with the boundary conditions in equation ( [ obc ] ) . from the solutions in equation ( [ phi1sol ] ) and ( [ phi4sol ] ) , we see that the above boundary conditions have non trivial solutions if and only if at least one of the factors in the products on the rhs of the equations is zero .",
    "this is only possible when @xmath155 .",
    "thus zero modes exist in this case only at @xmath156 . at these points ,",
    "the zero modes are similar the ones in the pbc case except that the wavefunctions strictly vanish in the region between the kink and the antikink .",
    "namely , if we consider a flux configuration with @xmath157 , then the wavefunctions are given by , @xmath158 @xmath150 and @xmath151 are given in terms of @xmath152 and @xmath153 as before .",
    "these wavefunctions are shown in fig .",
    "[ 7defect ] for @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the solutions for the zero mode equations ( [ zm1 ] ) and ( [ zm4 ] ) hold even for the case of inhomogenous chains where the coupling constants @xmath109 and @xmath94 depend on @xmath98 . the equations then read @xmath161 these solution to these recursion relations is exactly the same as the case of the homogenous chain with @xmath98 dependent @xmath162 .",
    "@xmath163 it is clear that by tuning the values of the site dependent couplings , a large variety of zero mode wavefunctions can be engineered .",
    "we can add the following  chemical potential \" term for the conserved flux operators , @xmath164 this term will not change the eigenstates but will alter the energy eigenvalues . if the @xmath165 can be tuned , then any particular flux configurations can be made the ground state .",
    "however it is still not known how to engineer these 3-spin operators in the physical realisations of the model in cold atom systems or in quantum circuits .",
    "to summarize , we have analysed an exactly solvable spin-1/2 chain which we call a tetrahedral chain .",
    "this model is a generalization of kitaev s honeycomb lattice model . like the honeycomb model , this model too has three coupling constants , @xmath134 , @xmath109 and @xmath94 . one of them can be scaled away , so without loss of generality , we can set @xmath104 .",
    "the model has conserved @xmath3 fluxes on every triangular plaquette , namely two fluxes per unit cell .",
    "we denote the values of these fluxes by @xmath166 .",
    "the fermionic spectrum in the background of the flux configuration depends only on the total flux in the unit cell , @xmath64 .",
    "consequently , every eigenstate of the model is @xmath63 fold degenerate , where @xmath2 is the number of unit cells .",
    "the ground state flux configurations of the model are the ones with @xmath65 .",
    "the model is gapless on the unit circle in the @xmath167 plane and is gapped everywhere else .",
    "we have found simple analytic solutions for zero energy wavefunctions for the majorana fermions .",
    "we have delineated the region in parameter space where these solutions exist . in the uniform case ,",
    "the two zero modes are peaked at the kink and anti - kink positions and are well separated if the kink and antikink are well separated .",
    "the analytic solutions also show how the zero mode wavefunctions can be engineered by tuning the couplings @xmath109 and @xmath94 in a site dependent way .    in conclusion",
    "our results show how zero energy majorana modes can be created and manipulated in the tetrahedral spin chain if it is possible to tune the flux configurations and the local couplings . in this work ,",
    "we have not addressed the interesting and important question as to how this is useful to braid unpaired majorana modes .",
