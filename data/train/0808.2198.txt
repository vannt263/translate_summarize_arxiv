    "jammed matter refers to a broad class of physical many - body systems ranging from granular matter to frictionless emulsions , and colloids . these systems share the property that their constitutive particles can be blocked in a configuration far from thermal equilibrium when undergoing a jamming transition .",
    "the statistical mechanical description of these materials is based on the volume fluctuations of the system @xcite taken to be the conservative quantity instead of energy , as typically done in thermal system . therefore , the probability distribution of the volume occupied by each jammed particle is of particular interest and many studies have been devoted to investigate them in detail @xcite .",
    "recently , a theory of volume fluctuations has been developed at the mesoscopic level providing a relation between the volume occupied by each particle and its number of contacts @xcite .",
    "thus , the distribution of particle volumes in the system is intimately related to the distribution of contacts per particle . in this paper , we calculate the distribution of ( orientational ) volumes occupied by each particle in a jammed system of monodisperse hard spheres and the distribution of coordination numbers by following the theoretical formalism of @xcite , which is in turn based on the edwards statistical mechanics of jamming @xcite .    the distributions of volumes and contacts in real packings represent ensemble averages in the statistical mechanics sense .",
    "therefore , the distributions depend on the state of the packings specified by their compactivity through a boltzmann - like probability in the partition function .",
    "we show that in two limiting cases of zero and infinite compactivity ( corresponding to the random close packing , rcp , and random loose packing , rlp , respectively ) the distributions can be obtained in analytical form .",
    "theory predicts that the distribution of orientational volumes is exponential with a mean volume varying with the average coordination number for rlp and constant for rcp .",
    "the theoretical predictions are compared with computer generated jammed packings of equal - size spheres for any friction coefficient .",
    "we find that the theory well reproduces certain features of the numerical distributions , but not all , in the entire range of volumes .",
    "the mean value of the occupied volumes is well reproduced by the theory .",
    "however , we find important deviations between theory and simulations for the higher moments of the distribution .",
    "for instance , simulations show a plateau for small volumes while theory predicts an exponential . for intermediate values",
    ", the exponential shape seems to provide a good fit to the simulated data and the predicted dependence of the characteristic volume on the coordination number follows partially the theoretical prediction .",
    "however , a higher scrutiny shows deviations in the tail of the distribution which is found to decay faster than exponential , having a compressed exponential tail .",
    "we conclude that the full understanding of the distribution requires a more precise theory .",
    "we discuss how to obtain more exact solutions of the volume distribution which can capture the behavior in the entire ranges of volumes . on the other hand",
    ", the distribution of coordination numbers provides fundamental information of the microscopic packing structures @xcite , as well as important characteristics of the mesoscopic volume ensemble . in this paper",
    ", we study the distribution of coordination numbers by generalizing the ensemble proposed in @xcite to include fluctuations in the number of contacts .",
    "theory predicts an exponential decay for large coordination number and an inverse exponential for small coordination number .",
    "computer simulations well reproduce the predictions .",
    "overall , the present paper serves as a critical assessment of the theoretical predictions of the mesoscopic theory towards the development of an exact formulation at the microscopic level that could capture the behavior in the entire range of volume and coordination number fluctuations of jammed matter .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the statistical mechanics theory developed at the mesoscopic level in @xcite , which serves as the theoretical framework for the study of the distributions of volumes and coordination numbers .",
    "a theoretical formalism of the volume ensemble is the starting point for the statistical mechanics of jammed matter @xcite .",
    "the role traditionally played by the energy in thermal systems is replaced by the volume , and a new parameter @xmath0 , called  compactivity \" , is introduced as an analogue of temperature . as a consequence , the canonical partition function can be written as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the free volume function , @xmath3 is the density of jammed states for a given volume @xmath2 , and @xmath4 imposes the jamming condition .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the free volume of coarse - grained  quasiparticles \" in a monodisperse hard sphere packing has an inverse relation with their coordination number @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the sphere volume . since the quasiparticles are coarse - grained over a uniform background field produced by other particles , eq.([eq : w1 ] ) should be understood as a mean - field result at the mesoscopic level . assuming the quasiparticles are independent , we can simplify the partition function eq.([eq : part1 ] ) by changing variables : @xmath8 the limit of integration here is given by the isostatic condition @xcite over the mechanical coordination number , @xmath9 , counting the contacts with nonzero forces .",
    "the mechanical coordination number is different from the geometrical coordination number , @xmath5 , which counts all contacts , even those with zero forces . by definition , it is easy to see that the geometrical coordination number @xmath5 is always equal or greater than the mechanical coordination number @xmath9 , and in general we have @xmath10 .",
    "the mechanical coordination , @xmath11 , depends on the friction , @xmath12 , the interparticle friction coefficient , and varies between @xmath13 and @xmath14 in dimensions @xmath15 .",
    "the density of states @xmath16 is assumed to have an exponential form , @xmath17 , with the constant @xmath18 , representing the typical separation of the configurations in the phase space ( analogous to the planck constant in quantum mechanics ) .",
    "we have @xmath19 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : part2 ] ) provides a useful tool to calculate the ensemble average of any physical quantity @xmath20 since @xmath21",
    "to calculate the volume distribution using the established mesoscopic formalism , we start by introducing the different definitions of the volume associated with each particle necessary to understand the problem . the starting point is the volume of a voronoi cell associated to each particle .",
    "the voronoi tessellation tiles the entire packing is shown in @xcite to be a good candidate for the volume function of jammed matter .",
    "the volume function replaces the hamiltonian in thermal systems , and describes the state of the jammed packings in the ensemble average in the partition function @xcite .",
    "the voronoi volume for each particle @xmath22 gives rise to the total volume of the system @xmath23 , when summed up over all the @xmath24 particles . in terms of the relative coordinates of the particles , @xmath25 ,",
    "we have obtained in @xcite for monodisperse particles of radius @xmath26 and volume @xmath7 the following formula for the voronoi volume :    @xmath27    where the integration is performed over the direction @xmath28 forming an angle @xmath29 with @xmath25 as in fig .",
    "[ voronoi - figure ] , and @xmath30 .",
    "taking advantage of this integration we can define an orientational voronoi volume , @xmath31 , for a fixed direction @xmath28 , satisfying :    @xmath32    from which we obtain : @xmath33 @xmath34 defines the orientational voronoi volume which is obtained without the integration over @xmath28 .    the average of the orientational volume over @xmath28 for a single particle , eq .",
    "( [ voronoi_s ] ) , is the voronoi volume , @xmath35 and the average of the orientational volume over many particles for a fixed @xmath28 is the same as the average of the voronoi volume over the particles : @xmath36 , in the case of isotropic systems .",
    "this last property is useful since it allows the use of the orientational volume to define the ensemble average of the volume fraction without resorting to the use of the voronoi volume which contains the average over @xmath28 and therefore is more difficult to treat from a theoretical point of view .",
    "we therefore promote the use of the orientational volume function @xmath31 as the fundamental quantity to characterize the state of jammed matter instead of @xmath22 .",
    "it is important to note that the probability densities of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in general differ .",
    "for instance , as discussed in fig .",
    "[ voronoi - figure ] the orientational free volume can be for instance zero while the voronoi free volume can not .",
    "the distribution of voronoi volume @xmath38 can be fitted by a gamma distribution @xcite , however , @xmath37 has a different form as shown below .",
    "we define the reduced free orientational volume function as @xmath39 ( we drop the subscript @xmath40 in @xmath41 for simplicity of notation ) .    in what follows ,",
    "we provide a theory for the probability distribution function of the orientational free volume , @xmath42 , which is less complex than the full voronoi volume distribution of eq .",
    "( [ vor1 ] ) . in @xcite ,",
    "this distribution is obtained under assumption of uniformity in the packing , making the theory valid at a mesoscopic level of a few particles diameters .",
    "this approximation can be seen as defining quasiparticles of free volume @xmath41 capturing the behavior at the mesoscopic distance . under this approximation the inverse cumulative distribution @xmath43 is obtained ( see eq .",
    "( 20 ) in @xcite and eq .",

( [ eq : w1 ] ) ) as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "we note that @xmath49 therefore , the orientational volume @xmath41 captures the behavior of the average volume function and thus can be used as the fundamental variable to define the microstates of the system instead of the more complicated voronoi volume .    the distribution of eq .",
    "( [ pws ] ) is not the distribution that one would obtain in real packings ( generated either experimentally or numerically ) corresponding to the ensemble average of eq .",
    "( [ pws ] ) .",
    "therefore , further examination is required to derive the distribution of orientational volumes which can be directly compared with real packings ; their states determined by the compactivity , @xmath0 .    under the volume ensemble point of view @xcite",
    ", the observables in real packings are ensemble average over the boltzmann distribution function . using eq .",

    "the rcp line is also generated by changing friction but the volume fraction remains constant , as seen in the figure , while the mechanical coordination varies from 6 to 4 .",
    "we focus on the calculation of the probability distribution function of @xmath41 for the packings along the rcp - line to test eq .",

    "instead , we obtain @xmath92 , below the fcc or dodecahedron value . in principle , this result is expected since the theory assumes random isotropic states while the fcc is an ordered anisotropic packing .",
    "however , the absence of a good fitting of the disordered branch through the fcc , together with the fact that the theory fits so well the disordered states , raises the interesting question of the existence of a phase transition between the rcp limit at @xmath90 and the fcc at @xmath87 . since packings can not equilibrate above @xmath90 without the formation of crystalline regions , we expect an ordered branch from the fcc point towards the rcp point .",

    "this scenario has been confirmed by analysis of numerical packings in a recent study @xcite , which showed that rcp can be interpreted as a  freezing point \" in a first - order phase transition between ordered and disordered phases .    to summarize this part of the study , while theory predicts an exponential behavior and approximates well some features of the distribution such as the average value ,",
    "simulations indicate that a compressed exponential fitting could be also possible .",
    "we therefore require more refined theories to account for the full behavior of the volume distribution .",
    "the present approach suggests that study of the ensemble of quasiparticles of fixed coordination number could provide clues to the behavior of the entire system through the edwards ensemble approach .",
    "while new theoretical concepts are required , current attempts indicate that it might be possible to develop a theory of the volume distribution that is exact to , at least , a given coordination shell of particles .",
    "it appears that @xmath42 for a fixed @xmath5-ensemble might be solved exactly by a brute force approach , since the range of a voronoi cell is finite .",

    "<S> we investigate the distribution of the volume and coordination number associated to each particle in a jammed packing of monodisperse hard sphere using the mesoscopic ensemble developed in nature * 453 * , 606 ( 2008 ) . </S>",
    "<S> theory predicts an exponential distribution of the orientational volumes for random close packings and random loose packings . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with computer generated packings reveals deviations from the theoretical prediction in the volume distribution , which can be better modeled by a compressed exponential function . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the average of the volumes is well reproduced by the theory leading to good predictions of the limiting densities of rcp and rlp . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a more exact theory to capture the volume distribution in its entire range . </S>",
    "<S> the available data suggests a plausible order / disorder transition defining random close packings . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider an extended ensemble to calculate the coordination number distribution which is shown to be of an exponential and inverse exponential form for coordinations larger and smaller than the average , respectively , in reasonable agreement with the simulated data . </S>"
