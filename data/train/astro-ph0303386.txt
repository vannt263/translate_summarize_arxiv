    "some studies on lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) have questioned whether enough stars could have been formed to accomplish reionization at so early a time ( ferguson , dickinson , & papovich 2002 ; dickinson et al .  2003 ) .    in the popular lambda - cdm cosmological model",
    "the seeds of galaxy formation lie in minute density fluctuations , which manifest themselves as temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "as the fluctuations continue to grow into dark matter halos , they trap gas within their potential wells .",
    "that part of the gas that is able to radiate its energy efficiently eventually condenses into dense molecular clouds , that give birth to stars .",
    "reionization has been studied within this paradigm both by semi - analytical methods ( giroux & shapiro 1996 ; ciardi & ferrara 1997 ; haiman & loeb 1997 , 1998 ; madau et al .",

    "the former necessarily involve broad simplifying assumptions and , therefore , have limited predictive power .",
    "the latter , although more realistic and fully self - consistent , are limited by the dynamical range that can be accommodated by existing numerical techniques on modern supercomputers .",
    "the two approaches are complementary and will have to remain so until the next generation of cosmological numerical codes become available on faster computers .",
    "for this paper we use a simulation that was reported in gnedin ( 2000 ) .",
    "the simulation includes dark matter , gas , star formation , chemistry and ionization balance in the primordial plasma , and an approximate implementation of 3d radiative transfer .",
    "all galaxies with total masses in excess of @xmath5 are resolved both spatially and by mass .",
    "the simulation was continued until @xmath6 .",
    "the overall picture for the evolution of the early universe that has emerged from this simulation is as follows :    star formation first begins in earnest at about @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the overall star formation rate increases to a maximum at about @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and decreases slightly thereafter .",
    "reionization of the intergalactic medium occurs over a prolonged period of time from about @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) to about @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , with expanding  regions in the low density igm merging at @xmath15 .",
    "this latter moment of rapid transition is often identified as the `` moment of reionization '' .",
    "this moment approximately corresponds to the mass ( volume ) averaged neutral fraction in the low density igm falling below 1 ( 0.1 ) percent respectively .    as a result of reionization",
    ", the gas content of halos less massive than about @xmath16 solar masses is drastically reduced .",
    "since this simulation does not include agn s , it provides a detailed example of how stars alone might be sufficient to accomplish reionization .",
    "the addition of agn s to this scenario would presumably lead to even more ionizing photons , which could take up the slack in the event that the amount of star formation in the simulation were overestimated .",
    "the simulation provides us with a detailed star formation history for each galaxy and thus allows us to make detailed photometric predictions . in this paper",
    "we present the star formation histories , luminosities , colors , mass to light ratios , and halo masses of the simulated galaxies .    our simulation , while state of the art , is only barely sufficient for our purpose , because the computational box is so small .",
    "this inherent limitation of any simulation limits the number of bright objects that can be modeled , while the observations approach the galaxy hierarchy from the other end , detecting bright galaxies and missing the dim ones . in this sense",
    "we can think of observations and simulations as moving toward each other along the galaxy luminosity curve .",
    "although there is not much overlap yet , the junction point has at last been reached , as we show below .",
    "we argue that to the extent comparisons can be made , our predictions are consistent with observations of lyman break galaxies .",
    "the varied star formation histories that we see provide the key to understanding why the observations appear to argue that lbg galaxies are too young to have reionized the universe .",
    "the specific simulation we use in this paper is fully described in gnedin ( 2000 ) .",
    "the simulation was performed using the softened lagrangian hydrodynamics ( slh ) code , which includes dark matter , gas , star formation , chemistry and ionization balance in the primordial plasma , and 3d radiative transfer ( in an approximate implementation ) .",
    "all these physical ingredients are required to properly model the process of cosmological reionization .",
    "the simulation of a representative cdm+@xmath17 cosmological model , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where the amplitude and the slope of the primordial spectrum are fixed by the cobe and cluster - scale normalizations . ] was performed in a comoving box with the size of @xmath23 with the total mass resolution of @xmath24 and the comoving spatial resolution of @xmath25 .",
    "this resolution is a reasonable compromise between the need to have the box large enough to accommodate several  regions and the need to have spatial resolution high enough to resolve sources of ionizing radiation .",
    "convergence studies presented in gnedin ( 2000 ) demonstrate that , while still limited , the resolution of this simulation is sufficient to model reionization at a semi - qualitative level ( with precision of the order of 50% or so ) .",
    "the simulation was stopped at @xmath26 because at this time the rms density fluctuation in the computational box is about 0.25 , and at later times the box ceases to be a representative region of the universe even for the dark matter .",
    "the simulation was designed in such a way as to approximately reproduce the measured star formation rate density at @xmath26 of about @xmath27 ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "our simulation assumes that all cosmological reionization occurs via radiation from _ stellar _ sources , with star formation parameterized by the phenomenological schmidt law as discussed in gnedin ( 2000a ) .",
    "an alternative and complementary scenario would be one in which the bulk of reionization is produced by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in light of recent high - redshift quasar counts ( e.g. , fan et al .",
    "2001 ) , a scenario in which the universe is reionized by bright optically selected qsos seems unlikely in any event .",
    "there remains however the possibility that low brightness agns contributed significantly ( if not dominantly ) to the reionization of the universe .    for the purpose of this paper , however , this simulation is quite suitable for the following reason .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to investigate whether galaxies are capable of reionizing the universe and still appear as young as they do at @xmath3 .",
    "thus , by ignoring the agn component , we consider the most extreme case , since we require galaxies to carry all the burden of reionizing the universe by themselves .",
    "one would then expect that if galaxies are capable of reionizing the universe _ and _ appear as young as they do at @xmath3 , then it will be even easier for the models to agree with observations if some ionization is done by agns .",
    "we identify galaxies in the simulation with gravitationally bound objects , which are selected with the denmax algorithm of bertschinger & gelb ( 1991 ) .",
    "population synthesis is carried out using the starburst99 package ( leitherer et al .",
    "the version we use included the july 2002 update , which revised the uv spectra for o and b stars .",
    "these spectra , based on the recent work of smith , norris , & crawther ( 2002 ) , have decreased ionizing radiation during the early stages of star formation .",
    "these changes affect not only the amount of lyman alpha continuum , but also the amount of lyman alpha that can be produced if this uv is absorbed by local gas .",
    "we choose the instantaneous burst option .",
    "this is appropriate because we apply spectral synthesis to individual stellar particles formed in the simulation , which sample the stellar distribution function at discrete time steps .",
    "we choose the lowest metallicity option ( 5% solar ) available in starburst99 , since the simulated galaxies have comparable metallicities .",
    "starburst99 maintains same metallicity for each subsequent generation of stars .",
    "this simplification should be sufficient for times less than about @xmath9 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "ultra - violet absorption by the igm material along the line of sight ( i.e.  by the lyman alpha forest ) is taken into account using the method of madau ( 1995 ) .",
    "reddening corrections are made by the method of calzetti ( 1997 ) , including the recent calibration data of leitherer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we find it sufficient to consider a range of reddening corresponding to a color excess of @xmath28 .",
    "higher amounts of reddening produce colors inconsistent with nearly all the observed galaxies .",
    "this range is in line with the estimate of shapely et al .",
    "( 2001 ) of an average color excess of @xmath29 for a sample of lyman break galaxies at a redshift of about 3 .",
    "this range is also generally consistent with the results of others for high redshift galaxies .",
    "we also allow for the partial escape of ionizing photons from the modeled galaxies by reducing the flux above @xmath30 by a factor @xmath31 , and converting 2/3 of the removed photons into lyman - alpha emission following the recipe of malhotra & rhoads ( 2002 ) .",
    "the escape fraction @xmath31 becomes another parameter in our modeling .",
    "we consider three values for this parameter : 0.1 , 0.5 , and 1.0 .",

    "the @xmath34 colors for observed galaxies over a range of redshifts were corrected to a redshift of 4.0 .",

    "but it appears that both the simulation and the observations can be fitted with the same luminosity function , implying that the simulation produces galaxies similar to the real ones .",

    ", our simulation has just enough volume to reach the luminosities of hdf galaxies , and is a factor of 2 too small to have a single galaxy as large as those found by steidel et al.(1999 ) in the simulation volume .",
    "thus , we are not able to make comparisons on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis yet , but future simulation will be able to model volumes comparable to those covered by observations in only a few years .    given a schechter function fit , we can integrate the total luminosity function to estimate the fraction of starlight in observed and simulated galaxies .",
    "we find that the observed galaxies contain about 2/3 of the total luminosity density , while the simulated ones account for about 1/3 .",
    "the contribution of observed galaxies to reionization is expected to be somewhat smaller however ( gnedin 2000b ) .",
    "this is because these galaxies tend to be clustered ( steidel et al .",

    "1998 ) , and most of the time several of them sit inside the same  region .",
    "when an  region grows to be larger than the mean free path of ionizing photons , these photons are wasted .",
    "these arguments imply that the redshift of reionization in the simulation is an underestimate , but not by a large factor because the star formation rate in the simulation increases rapidly with time ( gnedin 2000a ) .",

    "we expect that detailed simulations will become increasingly important in sorting out the various possibilities . the general picture that our simulation produces is at least consistent with observations of lyman break galaxies , an encouraging message to theorists .",
    "the recent results from the wmap mission ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) indicate that the optical depth to thompson scattering is significantly larger than in our simulation .",
    "while this measurement can not pin down the redshift of reionization , it suggests , if correct , that there was a considerable ionizing flux at early times .",
    "our simulation provides no support for a stellar origin of this ionizing flux .",
    "perhaps , very massive population iii stars , which we have not considered , could be responsible .    because , as we have discussed , the photoionization feedback likely plays a significant role in the evolution of faint lyman break galaxies",
    ", one might wonder how the wmap results affect the conclusions of this paper . as has been shown by several previous studies ( gnedin 2000b and references herein ) , the photoionization feedback results in the substantial loss of the gas mass of objects with circular velocities below about @xmath79 .",
    "however , this characteristic circular velocity is essentially redshift independent .",
    "so even if the universe was fully ionized throughout its entire history , the effect of the photoionization feedback at @xmath26 would be essentially at the same level as in our simulations .",
    "our conclusion about a reasonable agreement between the simulation and the data is , in fact , independent of the redshift of reionization as long as it is above about 6 .",
