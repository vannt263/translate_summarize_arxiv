    "relativistic hydrodynamics has been one of the essential tools to study the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite . a picture of the qgp as a nearly perfect fluid emerged from comparisons between experimental data and viscous hydrodynamic simulations @xcite with a small specific shear viscosity ( shear viscosity to entropy ratio @xmath1 ) that is very close to the lower bound @xmath2 @xcite computed for @xmath3 super - yang - mills ( sym ) theory in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the extraction of the specific shear viscosity relies on numerical solutions of the viscous hydrodynamics with realistic initial conditions .",
    "there has been tremendous progress in solving relativistic ideal and viscous hydrodynamic equations numerically with realistic initial conditions to simulate the dynamical evolution of the dense matter in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . analytical solutions , even with simplified initial conditions ,",
    "can also play a very important role in understanding the evolution dynamics and testing the consistency of numerical solutions .",
    "bjorken flow @xcite is a well - known analytical solution to the ideal hydrodynamic equation for a transversely uniform and longitudinally boost - invariant system .",
    "it has been recently extended to the gubser flow @xcite by including nontrivial transverse flow velocity with the help of conformal symmetry .",
    "moreover , an exact solution to the first - order viscous hydrodynamic equation ( the navier - stokes equation ) , which reduces to the gubser flow in the ideal limit , was also found @xcite . on general grounds ,",
    "one expects that the relativistic navier - stokes equation is pathological , and indeed this solution @xcite shows unphysical behaviors such as a negative temperature at early time . though attempts have been made to cure this problem by solving , semianalytically and numerically , the israel - stewart equation @xcite and the microscopic boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation @xcite , it is important to search for more complete and consistent second - order relativistic hydrodynamic equations @xcite and their solutions .    in this paper , we will go beyond the israel - stewart equation and find an exact and well - behaved analytical solution of the conformal second - order hydrodynamic equation from ref .",
    "@xcite that reduces to the gubser flow in a certain limit .",
    "we furthermore will use this analytical solution to check the accuracy of numerical solutions of the complete second - order viscous hydrodynamic equation based on ccnu - lbnl viscous hydrodynamic model ( clvisc ) and in turn test numerically the stability of the analytic solution . using clvisc and proper initial conditions , we find almost perfect agreement with the analytical solution within the accuracy of the numerical simulations .",
    "we also find that small perturbations to initial conditions dissipate quickly after a few @xmath4 of hydrodynamical evolution , indicating the stability of the solution .",
    "the study can help to build the state - of - art and analytically tested second - order viscous hydrodynamic models , and eventually lead us to a better understanding of second - order transport coefficients for the qgp in future phenomenological studies .",

    "our solution has the same transverse flow velocity @xmath63 as the gubser flow due to conformal symmetry .",
    "in contrast to the pathological solution of the navier - stokes equation , which has negative temperature at early time , our second - order viscous solution is always well defined in the whole space - time .",
    "the most interesting feature of the conformal second - order hydrodynamics studied in this paper is the nonlinearity of the equation .",
    "since @xmath64 is found to be nonzero in both strongly and weakly coupled systems , it is important to consider the possibility that the conventional idea of perturbative solutions to linear hydro evolution equations could break down .",
    "then , one has to include the nonlinear term @xmath65 and explore the unique structure of fixed - point solutions in nonlinear hydrodynamic equations . without the nonlinear term @xmath65 ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equation is a set of linear differential equations in terms of @xmath18 .",
    "however , the nonlinear term can completely change the nature of the evolution and admit nonperturbative solutions such as the one found above .",
    "this is clear from the fact @xmath66 . qualitatively speaking",
    ", this nonperturbative solution comes from the stable fixed point of nonlinear differential equations , which indicates that one can not recover the solution to the israel - stewart equation simply taking @xmath67 limit for this solution .",
    "furthermore , our numerical study presented below suggests that this fixed - point solution is stable .",
    "one more interesting observation is that the location of the fixed point approaches zero ( @xmath68 ) when we take @xmath69 , which allows us to recover the ideal solution .",
    "these are the truly distinct features of the nonlinear equation as compared to the linear hydrodynamic equation .",
    "we note that the relation between @xmath70 , @xmath64 and @xmath71 is designed to reduce the coupled differential equation with our analytic solution .",
    "it therefore does not provide any additional insights into the physical value of @xmath64 .",
    "such a relation only serves to find an analytic nonperturbative solution at a fixed point to a nonlinear hydro equation .",
    "nevertheless , we conjecture that there could be a similar fixed point solution even when @xmath72 is not satisfied .",
    "therefore , the implication of this solution could be more general .",

    "we employ the opencl gpu parallel language together with the kt algorithm implemented on graphic cards and the new code can reduce the simulation time by a factor of @xmath81 on a single gpu .",
    "clvisc treats the shear stress tensor @xmath18 as the source term of the ideal hydrodynamic energy - momentum tensor @xmath82 and implements them into two different evolution kernels , which makes the switch to ideal hydrodynamics easy .",

    "we find that it helps to reduce numerical errors by using @xmath96 instead of @xmath75 directly in the numerical simulations , since the numerical derivatives become tricky due to nonvanishing christoffel symbols in the @xmath7-@xmath8 coordinates .",

    "[ shear](a ) and [ shear](b ) , we plot two different components of the shear stress tensor . we observe a perfect agreement again between the numerical and analytical results for these quantities .",

    "[ shear](c ) that small two - dimensional gaussian perturbations initially added to @xmath18 at the central point dissipate quickly and have no effect on the hydrodynamic evolution for the rest of the system .",
    "it implies that both our numerical and analytical solutions are stable with respect to small perturbations .",
    "incidentally , we have checked that an equally good agreement is obtained when @xmath32 is positive and large . in the limit @xmath103 ,",
    "both analytical and numerical solutions approach the ideal gubser flow for both flow velocity and energy density .",
    "we have found an analytical gubser flow solution to the second - order conformal hydrodynamic equation beyond the israel - stewart theory .",
