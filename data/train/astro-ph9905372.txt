    "there is growing interest in using cryogenic bolometer technology in array detectors that can provide imaging spectrophotometry with high quantum efficiency in the optical range .",
    "in particular , there are well established programs developing superconducting tunnel junction ( stj ) devices ( _ eg._peacock , _ et  al._1996 ) for such arrays . manufacture and control of stjs",
    "have proved particularly challenging , but the wide range of potential applications ( _ eg._jakobsen 1999 ) , has motivated substantial investment in this technology . we have recently demonstrated a second bolometric device for time- and energy- resolved photon detection spanning the near ir through uv ( cabrera , _",
    "et  al._1998 ) .",
    "this transition - edge sensor(tes ) device , based on the sharp superconducting - normal transition in tungsten ( w ) thin - films offers remarkable new capabilities for problems requiring low energy resolution time - resolved spectrophotometry at low light levels .",
    "we have tested this instrument by coupling to small telescopes at our suburban campus site .",
    "initial test observations , including first measurements ( 12/98 ) of the crab pulsar were reported in romani , _",
    "et  al._(1998 ) ; here we describe in more detail our test system and new optical / ir phase - resolved pulsar spectra .",
    "very recently , the esa stj group has also detected the crab pulsar in the optical using a focal plane stj array at the 4.2 m wht ( perryman , _",
    "et  al._1999 ) , albeit with lower statistics and energy resolution than achieved here .    in the present application ,",
    "our detectors are 18 micron squares of 40 nm thick tungsten ( w ) patterned on silicon .",
    "the si substrate is cooled below the @xmath2mk transition in a kelvin ox 15 dilution refrigerator . by resistively heating ( joule power @xmath3 ) the pixels at a fixed voltage ,",
    "the w is stably driven into the transition range ; a photon is detected as a temporary deficit in the required joule power to keep the pixel at the stable set point .",
    "this    ` electro - thermal ' feedback speeds up recovery to the quiescent power level ( irwin 1995 ) . pixels with time constants as short as 2@xmath4s have been produced , allowing photons to be counted at rates of @xmath5khz per channel with minimal pile - up .",
    "the current deficit pulse associated with arrival of a photon is amplified via a dc squid array ( welty & martinis 1993 ) , digitized , assigned a peak height , time - stamped using a gps receiver and recorded to computer disk .",
    "tungsten is grey and photons hitting the pixel are absorbed with an efficiency varying from @xmath6% in the optical / uv to @xmath7% in the near ir ( palik 1985 ) .",
    "this substantial intrinsic efficiency can , in principle , be increased to near unity by ` blackening ' the surface with a passive absorber , _",
    "e.g. _ , au - black ( harris 1956 ) .",
    "calibration photons were introduced into the refrigerator dewar via optical fiber  we have demonstrated single photon detection from 0.3ev ( 4@xmath4 m ) to the fiber cut - off at @xmath83.5ev ( 0.35@xmath4 m ) ; the intrinsic device sensitivity continues to the saturation energy of 10 - 15ev .",
    "such an ultra - broad band is accessible only from space where these superconducting devices offer unprecedented new sensitivity for a number of important astronomical observations .",
    "we have initiated a series of ground - based experiments to illustrate the potential of these instruments .",
    "the substantial ir sensitivity of the detector , coupled with rapid increase in the atmosphere and telescope thermal emissivity in the near ir means that careful filtering to exclude @xmath9ev ( @xmath10 m ) photons was required to avoid detector saturation . since conventional filter glasses typically absorb beyond @xmath11 m and bandpass filters transmit in discrete octaves , we have adopted a novel filtering scheme to demonstrate the sensitivity to a larger energy range than that of ccds or conventional ir detectors . as radiation is coupled via optical fiber , we have spooled 3 m of ` wet ' ( high oh ) fiber at the 1k stage .",
    "the oh in this fiber provides strong attenuation ( humbach 1996 ) below 0.7ev and in secondary bands ( e.g. 0.91ev ) where , in any case , atmospheric oh limits transmission of astrophysical signals .",
    "the system was thus sensitive from the near - ir j and h bands through the visible . using a 50@xmath4 m core fiber we have coupled tes sensors to a 0.6 m telescope at our university teaching observatory ( fig 1 ) .",
    "the fiber , whose core subtended 4.8@xmath12 at the f/3.5 newtonian focus , was mounted in a reflective decker and was viewed through a pellicle by an acquisition camera . at the cold stage , the fiber output was focused through a ball and grin lens system to improve matching to isolated 18@xmath4 m square pixels . as focusing was incomplete , @xmath825% of the photons fell on the ( unmasked ) voltage bias leads of the pixels ( cabrera , _",
    "et  al._1998 ) , for which incomplete energy transfer to the w produced pulses with @xmath13 of the main photon energy .",
    "the contribution of these ` rail hits ' to the energy psf appears in the monochromatic calibration photon spectrum in figure 4 .",
    "photon pulses were digitized with 6 bit resolution , time - stamped to 0.1@xmath4s precision and recorded for later analysis .",
    "observations of the faint visible / ir spectrophotometric standards hd 73616 and hd 284504 ( gunn and stryker 1983 ) allowed an estimate of the system efficiency .",
    "the atmosphere and fiber plus detector system showed @xmath14 peak effective qe with a response spectrum consistent with the known atmosphere , fiber and w absorptivity .",
    "the bulk of the loss is traceable to known fiber inefficiencies in coupling into the dewar ; with improvements to this system , we expect to realize the high intrinsic sensitivity of the w absorber .",
    "on the nights of january 9 - 11 1999 , we observed several sources including the crab pulsar psr b0531 + 21 to illustrate the time and energy capabilities of the device . despite poor conditions ( high cirrus , @xmath15 imaging , moon , and suburban light pollution ) the data obtained clearly illustrate the potential of this new technology .",
    "the photons were barycentered using the current jodrell bank radio ephemeris ( lyne , pritchard and roberts 1999 ) and monitored for signal ( guiding and atmospheric transmission ) and background ( cirrus , moon and local lighting ) fluctuations . after moderate",
    "s / n cuts , some @xmath16 crab pulsar photons were accumulated into spectra in pulsar phase bins of width 0.005 ( 168@xmath4s , figure 2 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows our folded light curves in visible and near - ir bands .",
    "this observation is , to our knowledge , the first simultaneous detection of the crab at these wavelengths .",
    "the curves , normalized at the pulse wings below the half power - point , show a substantial ( 20% ) suppression of the main pulse peak , as noted earlier in lower time - resolution data ( penny 1982 ) . from our light curves , we find that the shape of the decrement is well fitted by synchrotron self - absorption with an optical depth @xmath17 , where the pulsar peak has a power - law flux spectrum @xmath18mjy with @xmath19 breaking from @xmath20 in the uv to @xmath21 at 2ev . this flux is emitted from a region of size @xmath22 cm near the light cylinder where the field is @xmath23 g .",
    "we assume a distance of @xmath24kpc . with these estimates the optical depth fit from our ir band light curve with @xmath25",
    "gives an @xmath26 pitch angle @xmath27 .",
    "comparison with flux measurements at longer wavelengths ( middleditch , pennypacker and burns 1983 ) indicates that the phase - averaged spectral break is likely caused by a low energy cut - off in the @xmath26 spectrum producing a critical frequency @xmath28ev . with our estimated @xmath29 and @xmath30 ,",
    "the pair spectrum then cuts off at @xmath31 .",
    "gap models ( romani 1996 ) predict that different pulse phases arise from regions with varying @xmath29 and plasma parameters .",
    "for example , the second pulse emission stems from lower altitude where a larger dipole @xmath29 is compensated by a smaller initial @xmath30 and rapid cooling of the @xmath26 to lower @xmath32 .",
    "higher s / n data from @xmath33ev following @xmath19 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 through the pulse would allow a map of field and plasma variations through the magnetosphere . we have not detected here ir spectral asymmetries noted ( eikenberry 1997 ) in the rising and falling slopes of the pulses , but this may be ascribed to our modest ir count statistics . again higher s / n observations showing these effects would be of interest , as their interpretation is sensitive to the precise ir / optical phasing .",
    "our flux calibrated spectrum ( figure 4 ) shows good agreement with published ( middleditch , pennypacker & burns 1983 ) near ir and visible main pulse photometry , although systematic errors in measurement of the calibration stars contribute residuals to the expected synchrotron spectrum exceeding those of count statistics .",
    "in addition to measuring spectral variations through the full period ( figure 2 ) , the timing of individual photons allows the search for other periodicities and stochastic fluctuations .",
    "for example , 60hz line fluctuations are seen in the @xmath36ev na background emission line dominated by street lamps in the san francisco bay area .",
    "we can also examine photon arrival time statistics : our data show that both the counts per period in the main pulse and the distribution of photon arrival times within each pulse are consistent with poisson at the 95% confidence level , for intervals larger than the maximum @xmath37s acquisition system dead time .",
    "several improvements to the existing tes sensor have been demonstrated or designed .",
    "count rates up to 30khz per read channel have been measured with appropriate tuning of the device transition temperature .",
    "rail masks to eliminate the low energy tail of the psf can be used to ease ir spectral analysis .",
    "thermal isolation of the w on a si@xmath38n@xmath39 membrane should additionally improve energy resolution to @xmath40ev .",
    "multiplexing schemes have been tested ( chervenal , _",
    "et  al._1999 ) which will allow arrays substantially larger than the few pixel / few read - channel capability of the present system ; @xmath8100@xmath41100 arrays may be achieved with present multiplexing designs , while advanced schemes are being explored which may allow readout of a programmable subset of megapixel - scale arrays .",
    "our test data already illustrate the potential of a tes spectrophotometer for studies of pulsars and stochastically fluctuating ( _ e.g. _ , interacting black hole and neutron star binary ) compact object sources .",
    "important experiments probing emission zone structures , pulsar plasma physics and relativistic photon propagation follow immediately from observations with the existing system at large aperture telescopes . even modest scale arrays should enable further applications in many fields .",
    "for example in biochemical studies time- and energy - resolved fluorescence imaging of multiply labeled biomolecules can characterize configuration and chemical activity on @xmath4s timescales . a number of important applications for astrophysics and cosmology have also been noted ( jakobsen 1999 ) for such detectors .",
    "the most striking progress will , of course , stem from placement of a tes array system in space , where diffraction - limited pixels and cool optics allow _ simultaneous _ observation over some two decades of photon energy .",
    "to illustrate , figure 5 shows simulated count spectra with a small ( 1 m ) aperture and modest exposure .",
    "the modeled sources are comparable to the _ faintest _ galaxies and galaxy components detected in the hubble deep field ( williams , _",
    "et  al._1996 ) .",
    "tes areal spectrophotometry should enable a whole new class of studies , providing morphology , redshift , spectral classification , and chemical evolution studies at the present limits of visibility in the universe .    this work was supported in part by grants from nasa ( nag5 - 3775 and nag 5 - 3263 ) , from the doe ( de - fg03 - 90er40569 ) and from the research corporation ; devices were fabricated in the stanford nanofabrication facility .",
    "we thank kent irwin and john martinis of nist for continued collaboration on tes and squid technology .",
