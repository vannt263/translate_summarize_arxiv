    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology , which is the standard paradigm of structure formation in the universe , contains several serious unsolved problems .",
    "recent observations of nearby less - massive galaxies and low surface brightness galaxies have revealed that the density profile of the dark matter halo is constant at the center of these galaxies ( e.g. , moore 1994 ; burkert 1995 ; de blok et al .",
    "2001 ; swaters et al . 2003 ; weldrake et al . 2003 ; gentile et al . 2004 ; spekkens et al . 2005 ; kuzio de naray et al . 2006 , 2008",
    "; oh et al . 2008 , 2011 ) .",
    "however , in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations based on collisionless cdm , dark matter ( dm ) halos always have a steep power - law mass - density distribution at the center ( e.g. , navarro et al .",

    "this discrepancy is a well - known unsolved problem in the cdm scenario and is so - called the `` core - cusp problem '' .    to solve this problem , this study has focused how baryon components gravitationally affect dm halos because less - massive galaxies like dwarf galaxies are more sensitive to stellar activity such as supernova explosions than giant ones owing to their shallow gravitational potential well . in dwarf galaxies , the hydrodynamic response against",
    "the stellar activity depends on the combination of various factors such as mass , morphology , and the star formation rate of the dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; yoshii & arimoto 1987 ; mori et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 , 2002 ; maclow & ferrara 1999 ; silich & tenorio - tagle 2001 , bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "in less massive galaxies with a smooth gas distribution , supernova feedbacks blow the interstellar gas out from the galaxy centers .",
    "this mass loss reduces the depth of the gravitational potential around the center of dm halos and may flatten the central cusp of these halos .",
    "so far , the dynamical effects of this process on dm halos have been studied using collisionless @xmath0-body simulations ( navarro et al .",
    "1996a ; gnedin & zhao 2002 ; read & gilmore 2005 ; ogiya & mori 2011 ; ragone - figueroa et al .",
    "ogiya & mori ( 2011 ) have argued the relation between dynamical response of dm halos and timescale of mass loss ( i.e. the star formation rate ) .",
    "the density profile of dm halos is correlated with the mass loss timescale and is flatter when mass loss occurs over a short time than that over a long time . however , even if mass loss occurs instantaneously , which is maximal effect , the central cusp remains ; thus ogiya & mori ( 2011 ) conclude that the mass loss is not a prime mechanism to flatten the central cusp .",
    "when the mass loss timescale is much longer than the dynamical time of the system , the density profile of the dm halo recovers its initial cusp profile .",
    "massive galaxies with moderate stellar activity are more robust against supernova feedback , so supernovae can expel only small fraction of the gas from these galaxies .",
    "the gas heated by supernova feedbacks shortly after a burst of star formation expands temporarily , and then the star formation is terminated .",
    "the expanding gas loses energy by radiative cooling and then falls back toward the galactic center .",
    "then , star formation will enhance again and ignite star burst subsequently ( stinson et al .",
    "this repetitive gas motion leads to the recursive change in the gravitational potential . using hydrodynamic simulations combined with star formation and supernova feedback ,",
    "the dynamical effects of such recurring changes have been studied ( governato et al .",
    "2010 ; pontzen & governato 2012 ; maccio et al .",
    "2012 ) and indicate that oscillations in the gravitational potential may modify the central cusp into a flat core .",
    "read & gilmore ( 2005 ) also argue the importance of recurring changes in the gravitational potential .",
    "the oscillation timescale is also an important factor in determining the dynamical effects on dm halos , and dwarf galaxies in the local group each have distinctive star formation histories ( sfhs ) ( e.g. , mateo 1998 ; tolstoy et al .",
    "2009 ; mcquinn et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b ; weisz et al .",
    "2011 ) . furthermore",
    ", recurring star formation activities duplicates properties ( e.g. , metal distribution , and the velocity - dispersion profile ) of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( ikuta & arimoto 2002 ; marcolini et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) . on the other hands ,",
    "several other mechanisms have also been proposed to solve the core - cusp problem .",
    "representative models involve the dynamical friction induced by the motion of gas or stellar clumps ( mashchenko et al . 2006 , 2008 ; inoue & saitoh 2011 ) and bar instability ( weinberg & katz 2002 ) .    in this paper , we investigate the physical mechanism about the cusp - core transition under the recurring change in gravitational potential of the interstellar gas .",
    "especially , we focus on the energy transfer driven by the resonance between dm particles and density waves induced by the oscillating gravitational potential .",
    "then , we clarify the cusp - core transition of the dm halos using collisionless @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "our analytic resonance model is described in  2 . in  3 , we present the result of our numerical simulations and interpret them with the aid of the resonance model .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss the results in  4 .",
    "the oscillation process ( i.e. dynamical oscillation of gas in galactic potential ) is an external force - like forced oscillation for dm halos .",
    "what is the dynamical response of dm halos to this force ? to answer this question , we construct a simple analytic model to analyze the possibility of resonance between dm particles and density waves induced by the external baryon potential .",
    "we approximate dm halo is treated as a fluid and the dynamical evolution of the system is described by the linearized fluid equations of the perturbed equilibrium state .",
    "hereafter , we label physical quantities in the initial equilibrium state as `` 0 '' , external forces as `` ex '' , and induced quantities as `` ind '' .",
    "we assume infinite constant density field to as the equilibrium state ( @xmath1 ) , pick out a group of particles which have some constant velocity ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "in addition , the absolute values of the induced quantities are assumed to be much smaller than that of the equilibrium state or the external force . with these assumptions , the linearized equation of motion",
    "is given by , @xmath3 where the induced potential @xmath4 is neglected .",
    "hereafter , we discuss the case in which the system is forced oscillation such as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the oscillation strength which is a positive constant , the wavenumber , and the angular frequency of the external force , respectively .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ euler ] ) is given as follows , @xmath8    the linearized equation of continuity can be similarly obtained , @xmath9 and the solution is given by @xmath10    from these solutions , we notice that when @xmath11 , the coefficients diverge , and this is the resonant condition .",
    "unfortunately , the signs of induced values are not able to be decided without the relations between @xmath7 and @xmath12 , and the phase of the wave .",
    "next , we consider the energy interchange between the dm collisionless system and the oscillatory external force .    in the following ,",
    "we evaluate the change of the kinetic energy density of the particle group with the constant density @xmath13 and velocity @xmath14 in the equilibrium state .",
    "the kinetic energy density in the equilibrium state @xmath15 and after wobbled by the external force @xmath16 are written by @xmath17 thus the change of the kinetic energy density , @xmath18 is @xmath19 averaging @xmath18 over a wavelength , we obtain the averaged change of the kinetic energy density , @xmath20 from eq .",
    "( [ delta_k_ave ] ) , when @xmath21 , the particle group gains the kinetic energy from the external force . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath22 , its kinetic energy decreases .",
    "note that we have thus far confined the argument to a particular group of particles .",
    "practically , the system have uncounted groups of particles , and each of them has respective densities and velocities in the equilibrium state . in the realistic self - gravitational systems , particles having low energy ( i.e. low velocity )",
    "are more dominated than particles having high velocity .",
    "thus , the change of the kinetic energy density overall the system , @xmath23 will be positive , i.e. , @xmath24 from eq .",
    "( [ delta_k ] ) , we know the system gains the kinetic energy from the external force substantively , and it will expand .",
    "in other words , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the whole of the system .    as an example , we assume maxwell - boltzmann distribution for particle velocity and evaluate the change of kinetic energy density overall the system , @xmath27 . to avoid the singular point of @xmath28 ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) we change the integration path as shown in fig.[contour ] .",
    "the value of the integration is conserved through this change .",
    "the integration can be separated into three parts , @xmath30 we can evaluate the second term using the residue theorem , and we find the second term is an imaginary number .",
    "we ignore it .",
    "the first and the third are positive and negative , since @xmath31 and @xmath32 is satisfied , respectively . the absolute value of the third term will be smaller than the first term , because it is damped by gaussian strongly .",
    "thus , @xmath23 will be positive , i.e. the system gains kinetic energy from the external force substantively , and it will expand .",
    "in other words , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the whole of the system .    according to the above argument , we conclude that the particles gain the kinetic energy effectively , if the particles satisfy the resonance condition , @xmath33 therefore , the system will expand to settle new equilibrium state , and the density will decrease .",
    "in this section , we apply the resonance condition to a spherical system and simply extend it as follows , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the distance from the center of the system , the wave number , @xmath36 as a function of @xmath35 is defined by @xmath37 assuming the virial theorem , @xmath14 in eq .",

    "( [ resonance_condition_2 ] ) becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the oscillation period .",
    "furthermore , we consider the resonances of the overtone modes . hereafter , `` 1 '' denotes the fundamental - tone , and `` @xmath44 '' denotes @xmath44-th overtone ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the resonance scale of the fundamental - tone is @xmath46 , thus those of the overtones are @xmath47 the resonance condition for the @xmath44-th overtone is @xmath48 .",
    "according to this argument , the resonance scale will be nearly equal to @xmath49 for which the resonance condition , @xmath50 is satisfied . from this equation",
    ", we can derive the resonant radius using the inversion procedure @xmath51    the resonance of the overtone modes will occur in the central dense region of the dm halo and the resonance of the fundamental - tone will appear in the outer less dense region . in the next section",

    "evidence of oscillating sfhs may be detected , and the oscillation period might be measured more precisely in the future observations .    in the series of subsequent studies , we will examine a more realistic model that includes non - spherical analysis and gas dynamics and that will more closely study the correlation between density structure and the sfh of dwarf galaxies .    cccccc galaxy & @xmath136 [ kpc ] & @xmath137 [ @xmath138 & @xmath139 [ myr ] & @xmath140 [ myr ] + ngc 2366 & 0.6 & 0.05 & 40 & @xmath141 + ngc 6822 & 1 & 0.03 & 50 & @xmath141 + holmberg ii & 0.5 & 0.03 & 50 & @xmath141 +      we would like to thank t. okamoto , and a. wagner for useful comments .",

    "<S> this cycle of expansion and contraction of the interstellar gas leads to the recursive change in the gravitational potential of the interstellar gas . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance between dark matter particles and the density wave excited by the oscillating potential plays a key role to understand the physical mechanism of the cusp - core transition of dark matter halos . the dark matter halos effectively gain the kinetic energy from the energy transfer driven by the resonance between particles and the density waves . </S>",
    "<S> we find the critical condition for the cusp - core transition that the oscillation period of the gas potential should be approximately the same as the local dynamical time of the dark matter halo . </S>",
    "<S> we present the resultant core radius of the dark matter halo after the cusp - core transition induced by the resonance using the conventional mass - density profile predicted by the cold dark matter models . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we verified the analytical model using @xmath0-body simulations and the results nicely confirm the resonance model . </S>"
