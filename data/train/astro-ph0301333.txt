    "the quasar 3c  279 ( @xmath16=0.536 ) has been one of the most intensively studied quasars for several reasons .",
    "it was the first radio source observed to exhibit the phenomenon of apparent superluminal motion ( knight et al .",
    "1971 ; whitney et al . 1971 ; cohen et al .",
    "1971 ) , prompting continued study with vlbi through the 1970 s and 1980 s ( cotton et al . 1979 ; unwin et al . 1989 ; carrara et al . 1993 ) and 1990 s ( wehrle et al . 2001 ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "a bright @xmath17-ray flare was observed from 3c  279 in 1991 by the egret instrument shortly after the launch of the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( hartman et al .",
    "1992 ) , leading to a great deal of multiwavelength coverage during the following nine years .",
    "3c  279 was one of the brightest @xmath17-ray blazars detected during the lifetime of the egret instrument ( hartman et al .",
    "it is one of the prototypes for the class of luminous `` red '' blazars ( sambruna 2000 ) .",
    "these studies have produced a large amount of data on 3c  279 .",
    "a number of nearly simultaneous multiwavelength spectra are available that show 3c  279 at various levels of activity .",
    "data previously published by maraschi et al .",

    ". strong variability on timescales of a day or less has been observed in optical through @xmath17-ray bands ( e.g. , wehrle et al .",
    "1998 ; hartman et al .",
    "2001b ) . in the radio regime ,",
    "the variability timescale is longer , and flux density monitoring at 4.8 , 8.4 and 14.5 ghz , complete with polarization data , has been obtained at the university of michigan radio observatory ( aller et al .",
    "monitoring at 22 and 37 ghz has been done at metshovi observatory ( tersranta et al . 1992 , 1998 ) .",
    "we have recently published a compendium of six years of vlbi images of 3c  279 at 22 and 43 ghz from 1991 to 1997 ( paper i ) , showing the kinematics of the parsec - scale jet . in this paper",
    "we combine the vlbi data from paper i with multiwavelength spectral information to calculate the doppler factor , orientation , and speed of 3c  279 s parsec - scale jet .",
    "the two - humped overall spectral energy distribution of blazars is most naturally explained with a jet of relativistic electrons emitting a combination of synchrotron radiation for the radio through optical - uv region , and inverse - compton emission at higher energies ( e.g. , wehrle 1999 ) .",
    "this interpretation of the spectrum leads to derivation of physical conditions in the jet that include bulk relativistic motion .",
    "evidence for bulk relativistic motion in blazars comes from many sources , including the observed apparent superluminal motions in blazar jets ( vermeulen & cohen 1994 ) , the transparency of blazar cores to high - energy @xmath17-rays ( dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) , rapid flux variability ( lhteenmki & valtaoja 1999 ) , high vlbi core brightness temperatures ( tingay et al .",
    "2001 ) , an excess of predicted over observed inverse - compton emission ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1993 ) , and arguments invoking equipartition or minimum energy requirements ( readhead 1994 ) .    this bulk relativistic motion can be quantified by the ratio of observed to emitted frequency , or doppler factor , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the angle to the line - of - sight , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "although evidence for high values of @xmath22 is strong , calculating @xmath22 for any given source is difficult , as we explain below .",
    "knowledge of @xmath22 is desirable because , together with the apparent superluminal speed , it constrains both the bulk lorentz factor ( important for studying jet energetics ) and the angle of the jet to the line - of - sight ( important for unification studies ) .",
    "one method of calculating the doppler factor is to use source properties measured from vlbi images and multiwavelength spectra to predict the x - ray flux density that should be emitted by the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process .",
    "this calculation typically over - predicts the x - ray flux density from the source . by assuming the source is relativistically beamed with a certain @xmath22 ( see equation  ( [ spheredelta ] ) ) , the conflict between the predicted and the observed x - ray flux density can be eliminated ( e.g. , marscher 1987 ; ghisellini et al . 1993 ) .",
    "if all of the x - rays from the source are not due to the ssc process from the component being considered , then a lower limit to @xmath22 is obtained rather than a firm value .    in practice , this method has many problems .",
    "it depends on the assumed geometry of the emitting region , and it depends sensitively on parameters that must be measured from multi - frequency vlbi images .",
    "many authors assume a homogeneous sphere geometry for the vlbi core ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "1993 ; mantovani et al .",
    "2000 ) . in reality",
    ", a homogeneous sphere is a poor approximation to the vlbi core , because it predicts a sharply - peaked synchrotron spectrum , and not the flat spectrum over several decades in frequency shown by many sources .",
    "a more realistic model for the vlbi core is an inhomogeneous conical jet , such as the model by blandford & knigl ( 1979 ) and knigl ( 1981 ) , which can reproduce the observed multiwavelength spectral indices .",
    "estimates for parameters such as the synchrotron turnover frequency of vlbi components also bring uncertainty into this calculation , and lhteenmki , valtaoja , & wiik ( 1999 ) show that plotting ssc doppler factors derived by various authors from different data sets for the same sources results in an almost pure scatter diagram , most likely due to varying assumptions about input parameters .",
    "ssc doppler factors have been calculated in detail perhaps only for 3c  345 by unwin et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "they modeled 3c  345 as a superposition of an inhomogeneous conical jet ( using knigl s 1981 formalism ) for the vlbi core , and a series of homogeneous spheres for the vlbi components or `` blobs '' .",
    "they then used multi - frequency vlbi data , quasi - simultaneous x - ray data , and the multiwavelength spectrum to constrain the doppler factor of 3c  345 . in this paper , we apply the procedure used by unwin et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) for obtaining inverse - compton doppler factors to 3c  279 .",
    "note that our goal in this paper is not to model the entire multiwavelength spectrum and short - term variability of 3c  279 using the knigl model .",
    "we use the knigl model as a geometry somewhat more sophisticated than a homogeneous sphere to calculate what we hope will be an accurate measurement of the ssc doppler factor , in order to constrain the jet orientation and speed . in particular , we make no effort to model the @xmath17-ray portion of the spectrum , because models including other radiation mechanisms , such as that of h01 and ballo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , show that this is quite likely due to external compton scattering and not ssc .",
    "the model of h01 does indicate that the lower energy portion of the inverse - compton spectrum ( the x - rays ) is likely to be dominated by ssc emission .",
    "we also consider only the comparatively `` quiescent '' emission from 3c  279 , because the rapid variability during flares may originate in components much smaller than the knigl jet , presumably small blobs ( like those in the h01 model ) that are moving out through the inhomogeneous jet and are superposed with the vlbi core in the vlbi images ( see paper i ) .",
    "note that even sophisticated homogeneous models such as that of h01 do not come close to fitting the radio emission , showing that some form of inhomogeneous jet component is required .",
    "while x - ray emission on larger scales in blazar jets may be caused by inverse - compton scattering of the microwave background ( e.g. , celotti , ghisellini , & chiaberge 2001 ) , on the parsec scales considered in this paper the synchrotron photon energy density is orders of magnitude higher than the microwave background energy density ( about @xmath23 ergs @xmath1 compared to @xmath24 ergs @xmath1 , using expressions from celotti et al .",
    "because of this large difference in energy densities , inverse - compton scattering of the microwave background is not considered further in this paper .",
    "the vlbi data used for this paper are taken from the 22 and 43 ghz vlbi observations of 3c  279 presented in paper i. these data included 18 epochs spanning the time range from 1991 to 1997 ( at 22 ghz ) and 1995 to 1997 ( at 43 ghz ) .",
    "earlier epochs in this sequence used the global vlbi network and mark ii recording , later epochs used the nrao vlba telescopes and correlator .",
    "the reader is referred to paper i for further discussion of the vlbi observations , and the vlbi images , model fits , and component identifications .",
    "two mosaics at 22 and 43 ghz from that paper are shown in figures 1 and 2 for ease in identifying features . throughout the rest of this paper",
    ", c4 refers to the moving component approximately three milliarcseconds from the core , c5 refers to the stationary component at one milliarcsecond from the core , and c5a , c6 , c7 , c7a , c8 , and c9 refer to the moving components that sequentially emerge from the core during the course of the monitoring .",
    "see paper i for more details .",
    "high resolution vlbi data at low frequencies is needed to constrain the optically thick vlbi component spectral indices , so we also make use of the 1.6 and 5 ghz space vlbi ( vsop ) observations of 3c  279 from piner et al .",

    "possibly the two simplest blazar models are the homogeneous sphere model ( gould 1979 ) and the inhomogeneous jet ( blandford and knigl 1979 ; knigl 1981 ) . in both models ,",

    ", the homogeneous sphere model assumes that the photon density within the spherical source is uniform , while the inhomogeneous jet model assumes that the source is a conical jet in which the magnetic field and electron number density have power - law dependences on the distance from the apex of the jet .    the homogeneous sphere model , the simpler of the two , requires six observables to determine the doppler factor and the angle between the source velocity and the line - of - sight . three of these characterize the synchrotron spectrum : the spectral index of the optically thin spectrum , and the flux density and frequency at which the sphere first becomes optically thick ( the `` turnover '' flux density and frequency ) . adding the angular size should in principle",

    "the sphere spectra have been adjusted to go through the three highest frequency observations for each component .",
    "inspection of figure 4 shows that homogeneous spheres can not fit the spectra of either the core or the jet components .",
    "this is because a homogeneous sphere has an optically thick spectral index of 2.5 , while the actual components have optically thick indices much less than this ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "evidently there are inhomogeneities in the `` components '' that broaden the self - absorption turnover and cause the spectral index below the turnover to be less than 2.5 .",
    "the high - resolution space vlbi data at low - frequencies was crucial to obtaining this result ; ground - based images at low frequencies blend the components so a spectral dissection like that in figure 4 can not be obtained .",
    "the primary advantage of the homogeneous sphere model is its simplicity ; it requires a minimum number of observables to constrain the doppler factor .",
    "for this reason , we proceed with the homogeneous sphere calculation in this section , with the expectation that corrections due to inhomogeneities ( at least for the jet components ) will be small .",

    "there are several reasons for this : the optical flux density of 3c  279 is known to vary by as much as 60% on timescales of a day",
    "( balonek & kartaltepe 2002 ) so variability may be a factor , in some cases one of the four observed spectral indices was poorly matched by the three free parameters @xmath97 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , and at some epochs there are apparently significant synchrotron x - rays , so the observed @xmath84 is not an accurate measurement of the compton spectral index at those epochs .",
    "the spectra in figure 6 do not extend up to the egret energy range , and we do not attempt to model the high - energy @xmath17-ray emission with the knigl model . although the knigl model can produce @xmath17-rays in the egret energy range , there is considerable evidence that the gev emission is external compton and not ssc ( kubo et al . 1998",

    "the values of the doppler factor obtained by applying a conical geometry to the core are about a factor of two lower than the doppler factors obtained using a spherical geometry ( @xmath95  [ sphere ] ) , showing that the assumed geometry can have a moderate influence on the ssc doppler factor .",
    "the average doppler factor from the fits in table  [ konout ] that allow for emission from an extended jet is 9 with a scatter of @xmath168 .",
    "when inputs to the model are all varied by 10% ( such that the changes all act together to increase or decrease the doppler factor ) , the fitted @xmath22 can be made to vary by about 30% .",

    "when the core is modeled as a conical jet , then on average the core produces about half of the x - rays , with the other half being split about evenly between c4 and the brightest inner - jet component .",

    "2002 ) find doppler factors ranging from 8 to 23 and from 12 to 19 respectively for application of their models to the various multiwavelength spectra presented in those papers . in these cases",
    "the angle to the line - of - sight and/or the lorentz factor are assumed input quantities , so the derived doppler factors are merely consistent within the framework of the particular model , not actual doppler factor measurements .",
    "in addition , these models do not apply constraints from the vlbi observations as we do in this paper , so they predict features in the vlbi maps that are not observed .",
    "the models mentioned in this paragraph predict apparent speeds in the inner jet ranging from 1 to 24@xmath162 , whereas the observations show apparent speeds in the inner jet to be about 5@xmath162 ( paper i ) , which is enforced by all of the models in table  [ konout ] .",
    "note that our reliance on the apparent superluminal speed assumes that the pattern speed observed in the vlbi observations ( paper i ) is equal to the bulk fluid speed . while there is one stationary component ( c5 ) that clearly does not move at the bulk fluid speed , all five components observed in the inner jet of 3c  279 ( c5a , c6 , c7 , c7a , and c8 ) during the course of the monitoring described in paper i moved with approximately the same apparent speed of 5@xmath162 ,",
    "so we take this value as an indicator of the apparent fluid speed in the inner jet .",
    "if the apparent speed is not used as an observable , then the speed and orientation of the jet are not tightly constrained in our models .",
    "for example , allowing the apparent bulk speed to range from 1 to 10@xmath162 allows the following ranges of parameters for the p1 model in table  [ konout ] : @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 .        in comparing conical and spherical models for the vlbi core , we find that a smaller doppler factor is required to reduce the predicted core x - ray flux density to the measured x - ray flux density using the conical geometry .",
    "this implies that , if a conical geometry is indeed the correct geometry for the vlbi core , inverse - compton calculations such as those of ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) that have assumed a spherical geometry may have systematically overestimated @xmath22 in their samples .",
    "the values of @xmath97 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 derived for the knigl model determine the orientation of the magnetic field and the ratio of relativistic particle to magnetic energy density .",
    "the value of @xmath117 can vary between 1 and 2 in the knigl model , with @xmath179 corresponding to a purely transverse magnetic field , and @xmath180 to a purely longitudinal field .",
    "conservation of particle number in a conical jet requires that @xmath181 , our values of @xmath182 imply that the total number of relativistic particles increases down the jet ( e.g. , from continuous acceleration adding to the total number of relativistic electrons ) .",
    "our fitted values of @xmath97 vary between @xmath152 and @xmath153 , our values of @xmath118 between 0.8 and 1.5 , and our values of @xmath117 between 1.6 and 2.0 , which corresponds to a predominantly longitudinal magnetic field in the region of the jet modeled by the knigl model , which is about 0.1 mas in size for 3c  279 .",
    "in contrast , vlbi polarimetry observations at many frequencies from 15 to 86 ghz ( leppnen , zensus , & diamond 1995 ; taylor 1998 ; lister , marscher , & gear 1998 ; homan & wardle 1999 ; lister & smith 2000 ; attridge 2001 ) have given magnetic field vectors oriented perpendicular to the jet in the core region .",
    "we do not consider these results to be in conflict , since the vlbi polarimetry observations show the core to have low levels of polarization even at 86 ghz ( attridge 2001 ) , suggestive of an initially tangled field that becomes ordered at shocks outside the knigl jet region .",
    "vlbi polarimetry with beams smaller than 0.1 mas would be needed to image the magnetic field structure in the region modeled in this paper .",
    "the values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 also determine how the ratio of relativistic particle to magnetic energy density varies along the jet ( it goes approximately as @xmath183 ) , this ratio is quoted in table  [ konout ] at radii @xmath138 and @xmath143 .",
    "the jet is close to equipartition at @xmath138 , but the degree of particle dominance increases down the jet , and at @xmath143 the relativistic - particle energy density dominates the magnetic energy density by roughly two orders of magnitude . the increasing particle dominance of knigl jets with jet radius seems to be a common feature of these models when @xmath118 and @xmath117 are determined from spectral fits ( rather than assumed ) .",

    "this finding contrasts with that of lhteenmki et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who find that doppler factors computed by comparing variability and vlbi brightness temperatures in general agree with equipartition doppler factors , although analysis of brightness temperature measurements from the high - resolution vlbi data of paper i has shown that this is not the case for 3c  279 .    from the particle energy density",

    "note that @xmath186 depends on @xmath123 , which is not precisely known ( although the observed lack of faraday rotation in most extragalactic radio sources implies @xmath187 , jones & odell 1977 ) , so that this is only an order - of - magnitude calculation . from equation  [ kinflux ] , the particle energy flux is of order 10@xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "this is of the same order as the particle kinetic energy fluxes found by celotti & fabian ( 1993 ) , for a sample of sources that included 3c  279 .",

    "the spectral index in the knigl model fit for 3c  279 that has the poorest observational constraints is the synchrotron index below the turnover frequency , @xmath81 .",
    "this is because the extended jet emits a significant fraction of the flux at low radio frequencies , so that what we get from the single - dish spectra shown in figure 6 is the spectrum of the core plus jet , when what we want is the spectrum of the core alone .",
    "the observed @xmath81 thus provides only a limit to the actual @xmath81 , with high - resolution vlbi at low frequencies being needed to accurately measure @xmath81 .",
    "there are indications from vsop observations at 1.6 and 5 ghz ( piner et al . 2000 ) that , at least at that epoch , the spectral index of the vlbi core was much more inverted than the values of @xmath81 quoted in table  [ mwspectra ] . if confirmed by further vsop data on 3c  279 ( edwards et al . in preparation ) , this would rule out a pure knigl jet model for the 3c  279 core at these epochs . because the knigl model was created in part to explain the flat radio spectra of quasars , very inverted values of @xmath81 ( less than about @xmath198 ) create contradictions in the model , such as a synchrotron break that goes the ` wrong way ' ( @xmath199 )",
    "this situation could be rectified by adding a homogeneous component ( a newly emerging ` blob ' ) that is blended with the vlbi core on the vlbi images .",
    "it seems likely that , in the general case , the spectrum of the vlbi core is a blend of an inhomogeneous component like a knigl jet and one or more shocks moving along the jet .",
    "because these would all be merged on the vlbi images , it would be impossible to determine an inverse - compton doppler factor in this case , because the crucial observational constraint provided by the vlbi size would be missing . the degree to which the `` quiescent '' emission from 3c  279 can be represented by a single inhomogeneous component",

    "the situation for 3c  279 is not so straightforward .",

    "<S> we follow the method previously used by unwin et al . for 3c  345 to model the jet components as homogeneous spheres and the vlbi core as an unresolved inhomogeneous conical jet , using knigl s formalism .    </S>",
    "<S> the conical - jet model can be made to match both the observed x - ray emission and the vlbi properties of the core with a suitable choice of doppler factor , implying the core makes a significant contribution to the x - ray emission , in contrast to the situation for 3c  345 , where the jet components dominated the x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the knigl models indicate the jet is particle dominated at the radii that produce significant emission ( from @xmath0 5 to 20 pc from the apex of the jet for most models ) , and is not in equipartition . at the inner radius of the knigl jet </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is of order 0.1 g and the relativistic - particle number density is of order 10 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy flux in the jet is of order 10@xmath2 ergs sec@xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the ratio of proton to electron energy , which implies a mass accretion rate of order @xmath5 yr@xmath3 , where @xmath6 is the efficiency of conversion of mass to kinetic energy .    </S>",
    "<S> when all components are included in the calculation , then on average the core produces about half of the x - rays , with the other half being split between the long - lived component c4 and the brightest inner - jet component . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate an average speed and angle to the line - of - sight for the region of the jet interior to 1 mas of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 , and an average speed and angle to the line - of - sight for c4 ( at @xmath10 mas ) of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> these values imply average doppler factors of @xmath14 for the inner jet , and @xmath15 for c4 . </S>"
