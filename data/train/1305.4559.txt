    "the game of cops and robbers on graphs was introduced independently by quilliot @xcite and nowakowski and winkler @xcite , and has generated a great deal of study ; see , e.g. , @xcite . in the original formulation a cop and robber move alternately and deliberately , with full information , from vertex to adjacent vertex on a graph @xmath2 , with the cop trying to capture the robber and the robber trying to elude the cop . in this work ,",
    "all graphs are assumed to be connected , simple ( no loops or multiple edges ) and undirected .",
    "a graph is said to be `` cop - win '' if there is a vertex @xmath3 such that for every @xmath4 , the cop beginning at @xmath3 can capture the robber beginning at @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to their obvious role in pursuit games , cop - win graphs ( which are also known as `` dismantlable '' graphs ) have appeared in diverse places including statistical physics @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we consider a variation suggested @xcite by ross churchley of the university of victoria , in which the robber is no longer in control of his fate ; instead , at each step he moves to a neighboring vertex chosen uniformly at random .",
    "we may therefore imagine that the robber is in fact a drunk  one who is too far gone to have an objective .    on any graph , the drunk will be caught with probability one , even by a cop who oscillates on an edge , or moves about randomly ; indeed , by any cop who is nt actively trying to lose .",
    "the only issue is : how long does it take ?",
    "the lazy cop will win in expected time at most @xmath6 ( plus lower - order terms ) , since that is the maximum possible expected hitting time for a random walk on an @xmath0-vertex graph @xcite ; the same bound applies to the random cop @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that the greedy cop who merely moves toward the drunk at every step can achieve o@xmath7 ; in fact , we will show that the greedy cop can not in general do better .",
    "our smart cop , however , gets her man in expected time @xmath1 .",
    "note that when the adversaries play on a lollipop graph consisting of a clique of size @xmath8 ( for some constant @xmath9 ) with a path of length @xmath10 attached at one end , with the drunk starting in the clique and the cop starting at the opposite endpoint of the path , the expected capture time will be @xmath11 , and we conjecture that this is worst possible .",
    "in this variation , a `` move '' ( as in chess ) will consist of a step by the cop followed by a ( uniformly random ) step by the drunk .",
    "capture or `` arrest '' takes place when the cop lands on the drunk s vertex or vice - versa , and the capture time @xmath12 is the number of the move at which this takes place .",
    "let us consider some examples .",
    "( 1 ) suppose @xmath2 is the path @xmath13 on @xmath0 vertices , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 its endpoints",
    ". then the cop will ( using any of the algorithms we consider later ) move along the path until she reaches the drunk ; this will take expected time about @xmath14 since a random walk on a path will on average progress about distance @xmath15 in time @xmath16 .",
    "\\(2 ) let @xmath2 be the complete balanced bipartite graph @xmath17 , with the cop and the drunk beginning on the same side .",
    "then the poor cop will find herself always moving to the opposite side from her quarry until , finally , he accidently runs into her ; since the latter event occurs with probability about @xmath18 , arrest takes on average @xmath19 steps .",
    "the reader may feel with some justification that we are being unrealistic in not allowing the cop to stay put ; in example ( 2 ) , sitting for one move would enable her to catch the drunk on the next move .",
    "ultimately , we force the cop to move at each step in order to hold her to the same constraints as her quarry s , and because it gives us the strongest results .",
    "our bounds still apply when the cop , the drunk , or both are allowed to stay put on any move .    even when the cop is permitted to idle",
    ", she can not expect to catch the drunk in time bounded by a function of the diameter of @xmath2 .",
    "example ( 3 ) , let @xmath2 be the incidence graph of a projective plane of order @xmath0 .",
    "a projective plane @xmath20 of order @xmath0 is a collection of objects called `` points '' and sets of points called `` lines '' satisfying the following conditions :    1 .   [ 2points1line ] two points determine a unique line . 2 .",
    "[ 2lines1point ] two lines intersect in a unique point .",
    "3 .   [ n+1points ]",
    "every line consists of exactly @xmath21 distinct points .",
    "[ n+1lines ] every point lies on exactly @xmath21 distinct lines .",
    "+ furthermore @xcite , 5 .",
    "@xmath20 contains exactly @xmath22 distinct points .",
    "@xmath20 contains exactly @xmath22 distinct lines .",
    "projective planes of order @xmath0 are known to exist for @xmath23 for any prime number @xmath24 and positive integer @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the incidence graph @xmath2 of @xmath20 is therefore a graph with @xmath26 vertices , with adjacency relation @xmath27 if @xmath3 is a point in @xmath20 and @xmath4 is a line that goes through @xmath3 , or vice versa .",

    "to see this , we proceed by induction on the size of the tree , @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath49 , the capture time is clearly less than @xmath0 ( since the drunk will run into the cop on his first move ) .",
    "now suppose that on any tree with @xmath50 vertices , the expected capture time is at most @xmath16 , and let @xmath12 be a tree on @xmath0 vertices , rooted at @xmath51 ( the cop s initial position ) .",
    "for all descendants @xmath4 of @xmath51 , let @xmath52 be the subtree of @xmath12 consisting of @xmath4 and all of its descendants .",
    "so the game begins on @xmath53 , and after the first move , since the drunk can not get `` behind '' the cop without being caught , the game is being played on @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the cop s position after one step .",
    "( note that by the greedy strategy , @xmath55 is the unique neighbor of @xmath51 which is on the path from @xmath51 to @xmath56 , the drunk s position after he takes his first step . )",

    ", one can guarantee only that at a given point in time the drunk will step toward the cop with probability at least @xmath59 , giving a bound of order @xmath60 for the greedy cop . that may appear to be a gross overestimate , especially in light of the special cases discussed above , but a graph with many high - degree vertices can still have large diameter .",
    "for example , consider the following graph .",
    "the `` ladder '' in this graph consists of two copies of the path @xmath61 with each pair of corresponding vertices connected by an edge .",
    "the `` basement '' consists of a complete bipartite graph , @xmath62 .",
    "we begin with the drunk inside the basement , and the cop on the far end of the ladder . while the drunk is meandering inside the basement , the cop  staying true to her goal of minimizing the distance between her and the drunk at each step  is alternating between the two paths .",
    "note that we assume she makes the foolish choice when she is presented with several options by her algorithm .",
    "it takes the drunk @xmath63 moves on average to leave the basement , and each time this occurs , the cop will decrease the distance by 2 by traveling along her current path . therefore the capture will require an average of about @xmath64 steps .",
    "as noted in the example of the `` ladder to the basement '' graph in section  [ prelims ] , a foolish greedy cop can be foiled by her desire to `` retarget '' too often .",
    "that is , since she updates the target vertex ( to which she is trying to minimize her distance ) at each step , she is made indecisive by an indecisive drunk .",
    "one natural solution to this problem would be to walk directly toward the robber s initial position in the basement for several steps before retargeting .",
    "continuing in this way , the cop makes steady progress , ultimately catching the drunk in time less than @xmath0 .    in general ,",
    "if a cop and drunk begin at distance @xmath65 on a graph , and the cop proceeds by retargeting every four steps , then by lemma  [ 4lemma ] below , it would take @xmath66 moves to get down to distance less than four .",
    "since @xmath65 can be as large as @xmath58 , this would not suffice to yield our promised bound of @xmath67 , so the cop must first do something else to get her distance to the drunk down without spending too much time doing so  hence the following four - stage strategy .    for",
    "@xmath68 $ ] , let @xmath69 be the time spent in stage @xmath70 and @xmath71 be the distance between the two players at the end of stage @xmath70 .",
    "in the first stage , the cop heads directly for the drunk s initial position , @xmath72 , so that @xmath73 . in the meantime",
    ", the drunk has gone somewhere else , and so suppose that by the time that the cop reaches @xmath72 , the drunk is at @xmath74 .",
    "now we are in stage 2 , and the cop heads for @xmath74 .",
    "we show @xmath75 = o(n)$ ] . during stage 3",
    ", the cop updates her `` target '' every four steps , and we show that the expected time for this stage , @xmath76 $ ] , is again bounded by @xmath77 .",
    "this stage ends when we are at distance at most three from the drunk . in stage  4",
    ", the cop waits for the drunk to make an error , which happens in expected time at most @xmath78 and results in the capture of the drunk .",
    "all together , this cop captures the drunk in expected time @xmath79",
    ". we will refer to the progress made by the cop in the first two stages as `` gross progress , '' and in the last two stages as `` fine progress . '' in order to prove the bounds claimed above , it will be beneficial to have a few lemmas .",
    "suppose that the drunk starts on vertex @xmath3 and the cop starts at @xmath4 .",
    "as noted in the set - up of the previous section , in the first stage of the cop s strategy , she is concerned only with getting to @xmath3 ( even if this may not decrease her distance from the drunk at the end of the stage ) . clearly the time this takes",
    "is equal to @xmath80 .",
    "we would like to get a bound on @xmath81 $ ] , the expected distance between the cop and the drunk at the end of this stage .",
    "for that , the following lemma will prove quite useful .",
