    "convex geometries were studied from different perspectives and under different names since the 1930s . r.p .",
    "dilworth @xcite knew them as lattices with unique irredundant decompositions , and b.  monjardet mentions many ways the convex geometries were rediscovered before the mid-80s @xcite .",
    "an important survey by p.h .  edelman and r.e .",
    "jamison @xcite included results on several equivalent definitions of finite convex geometries and outlined a program for future studies , suggesting a list of open problems .",
    "convex geometries are interesting combinatorial objects which generalize a notion of convexity in euclidean space .",
    "there are many structures which share their properties . among them",
    "are convex objects in euclidean space , convex sets in posets , subsemilattices in a semilattice , and others that are considered in @xcite .",
    "but the main driving example is a geometrical one : a set of points in euclidean space equipped with a closure operator of the convex hull .",
    "this convex geometry nowadays is called _ affine _ convex geometry . among important problems raised in @xcite",
    "was the following :    [ prob1 ] describe affine convex geometries , i.e. , list the properties which ensure that a finite convex geometry can be represented by convex subsets of some finite point configuration in a finitely dimensional euclidean space .",
    "a few partial results were obtained towards the solution of this problem , showing that the problem is rather difficult .",
    "first , affine convex geometries , represented by simple configuration on a plane : a single point inside a @xmath1-gon - were described by p.h .",
    "edelman and d.g .",
    "larman @xcite .",
    "already the simplest generalization , two points inside a @xmath1-gon on a plane , became a much harder problem , as shown in k. adaricheva @xcite .",
    "more recently , k.  adaricheva and m.  wild @xcite have shown that some modification of problem [ prob1 ] is ( polynomially ) equivalent to the order type problem , which is np - hard , the latter result following from the universality theorem of n.e .",
    "mnv @xcite .",
    "a new stage of studies of convex geometries started from the publication of k.  adaricheva , v.  gorbunov and v.  tumanov @xcite , when important generalizations were made from the finite case to the infinite one .",
    "in that paper some important results were proved with respect to the _ embedding _ of finite geometries , treated as finite lattices , into larger lattices , which would inherit some properties one would like to see in the infinite version of convex geometries . in particular ,",
    "one of the key results of the paper was the finding a _ universal class _ for finite convex geometries , i.e. a specific class of convex geometries , which would accept any finite convex geometry as a _ sub - geometry_. that specific class comprises lattices of algebraic subsets of algebraic lattices , which are not necessarily finite .",
    "for that reason , the paper has also raised the problem of finding a universal class comprising only _ finite _ convex geometries :    [ prob2 ] find a class @xmath2 of _ finite _ convex geometries , such that every finite convex geometry is a sub - geometry of some geometry in @xmath2 .",
    "one natural candidate for such representation was also indicated in @xcite : the class of affine convex geometries .",
    "two similar results were proved , by different methods , in f.  wehrung and m.  semenova @xcite and k.  adaricheva @xcite , showing that the class of affine convex geometries is universal for finite convex geometries without cycles , a.k.a convex geometries which are _ lower bounded _ , if they are treated as lattices .",
    "lower bounded lattices play an important role in lattice theory , especially in the study of free lattices , see monograph r.  freese , j.   jeek and j.b .",
    "nation @xcite .",
    "finally , it was shown by k.  kashiwabara , m.  nakamura and y.  okamoto @xcite that every finite convex geometry is a sub - geometry of some affine convex geometry in @xmath3 , solving problem [ prob2 ] in the positive .",
    "the two problems above showcase the different types of representation for convex geometries , and the second one is a generalization of the first one . while the first one assumes the _ isomorphism _ between lattices of closed sets of convex geometries , the second requires _ embedding_. we note that embedding constitutes the classical algebraic approach to representation problems , allowing a lot of flexibility . to distinguish between the two types of representations for convex geometries",
    ", we will call the representation by isomorphism a _ strong representation _ , and by embedding a _",
    "weak representation_.    to summarize , we say that the weak representation problem for finite convex geometries is now solved , with respect to at least two universal classes : finite affine convex geometries and lattices of algebraic subsets of algebraic lattices .",
    "with respect to the first universal class , the problem of finding the optimal dimension for representation clearly arises : what is the smallest dimension @xmath1 of space @xmath3 such that a given convex geometry is a sub - geometry of affine geometry in @xmath3 ?",
    "for example , construction in @xcite would require @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a ground set of convex geometry .",
    "on the other hand , if geometry is without cycles , the construction in @xcite would require a smaller dimension : @xmath6 .    recently , m.  richter and l.  rogers @xcite established an upper bound for the dimension @xmath1 of the weak representation of convex geometry by an affine geometry : @xmath7 .",
    "here @xmath8 is a _ convex dimension _ of a geometry , a parameter discussed in @xcite .",
    "generally , it would be interesting to characterize convex geometries that can be weakly represented by affine geometries in @xmath3 .",
    "the necessary condition for such representation , called the @xmath1-carousel rule , was established in k.  adaricheva @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that it implies the @xmath1-carathodory property .",
    "as far as the strong representation is concerned , a new idea was introduced by g.  czdli @xcite , who suggested using circles rather than points in @xmath9 for the ( strong ) representation of convex geometries of the convex dimension @xmath10 .",
    "apparently , circles provide much more flexibility for the strong representation of convex geometries . indeed ,",
    "affine convex geometries are _ atomistic _ , i.e. , one - element subsets of the ground set of convex geometry are always convex .",
    "this would restrict the possibility of the strong representation by affine geometries to _",
    "convex geometries only . replacing points by circles ( or , more commonly , by balls in @xmath3 )",
    "removes such restriction for the strong representation .",
    "taking the idea even further , m.  richter and l.  rogers in @xcite showed how to use _ polygons _ for the strong representation of convex geometries on the plane . in a sense , this is a nice visualization of the theorem in @xcite about compatible orderings of a convex geometry and its parameter @xmath11 .",
    "we note though that polygons that appear in this result are not necessarily convex themselves . also , the relative position of such polygons is very restricted , unlike the case with representation by circles .    in our paper",
    "we tackled the problem of representation by circles on a plane , discussed first in @xcite .",
    "it was natural to venture , after the result of @xcite , whether arbitrary convex geometries , in particular , those with @xmath12 , could be strongly represented by circles on a plane .    in this paper",
    ", we answer this question _ in negative _ , demonstrating an example of convex geometry with @xmath13 , which can not have such a representation .    moreover , we prove in theorem [ theorem2 ] that all convex geometries having strong representation by circles on a plane satisfy the property which we call the _",
    "weak @xmath0-carousel rule_. indeed , this property is a weakening of the @xmath10-carousel rule , first introduced in @xcite .    naturally , this brings a question generalizing problem [ prob1 ] , which was first formulated in @xcite :    is every finite convex geometry ( strongly ) represented by a convex geometry of balls in @xmath3 ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ definitions ] we introduce the main concepts and definitions , and provide several statements in the background of our investigation .    in section [ weakcarouseltriangles ]",
    "we give the outline of the proof of the main theorem and prove the weak carousel property for triangles , a partial case of the weak @xmath0-carousel rule in the geometry of circles on a plane .",
    "the proof of the weak carousel property for triangles requires a number of geometrical results which are stated and proved in section [ lemmas ] .",

    "<S> convex geometries are closure systems satisfying the anti - exchange axiom . </S>",
    "<S> every finite convex geometry can be embedded into a convex geometry of finitely many points in an n - dimensional space equipped with a convex hull operator , by the result of k.  kashiwabara , m.  nakamura and y.  okamoto ( 2005 ) . allowing circles rather than points , as was suggested by g.  czdli ( 2014 ) , </S>",
    "<S> may presumably reduce the dimension for representation . </S>",
    "<S> this paper introduces a property , the weak @xmath0-carousel rule , which is satisfied by all convex geometries of circles on a plane , and we show that it does not hold in all finite convex geometries . </S>",
    "<S> this raises a number of representation problems for convex geometries , which may allow us to better understand the properties of euclidean space related to its dimension .    </S>",
