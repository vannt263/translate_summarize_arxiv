    "in the past decade , the physical properties of the magnetic insulator cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 have been explored experimentally using a variety of different experimental techniques , such as inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , ultrasound measurements @xcite , and nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "it is now generally accepted @xcite that at low temperatures the magnetic properties of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 can be modeled by a quasi - two - dimensional spin-@xmath2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model where the spins within the layers form an anisotropic triangular lattice with two different nearest neighbor exchange couplings @xmath7k and @xmath8k , as shown in fig .",

    "it is therefore reasonable to describe the spin - liquid phase of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 within a purely two - dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , @xmath27 where the spin @xmath28 operators @xmath29 are localized on the sites @xmath30 of a distorted triangular lattice and the exchange couplings @xmath31 are only finite if @xmath32 connect nearest neighbor sites on the lattice . at this point",

    "given the fact that in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 the ratio @xmath43 is not really small , it is at first sight reasonable to expect that the nature of the spin - liquid phase is such that the elementary excitations of the spin liquid can propagate coherently in all directions on the two - dimensional lattice .",
    "however , a theory where the elementary excitations of the spin liquid resemble the one - dimensional fermionic spinon excitations of a heisenberg chain has been highly successful @xcite , suggesting that the spin - liquid phase in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 supports elementary excitations which can only propagate coherently along the direction @xmath34 of the strongest bond . in a simple picture ,",
    "this dimensional reduction in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 arises from a strong frustration - induced reduction of the effective coupling @xmath44 associated with the weaker bonds @xcite .",
    "however , a quantitative microscopic conformation of this scenario using many - body methods is rather involved . in this work",
    ", we shall show that a straightforward mean - field theory based on the well - known representation of the spin operators in terms of majorana fermions @xcite naturally explains the dimensional reduction in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 .",
    "specifically , we find that an anisotropic spin - liquid state where the fractionalized fermionic excitations can only propagate coherently along the direction of the strongest bond minimizes the free energy already at the mean - field level .",
    "if the external magnetic field has a component parallel to the layers , the phase diagram of quasi - two dimensional frustrated antiferromagnets is more complex , as discussed in a series of recent theoretical works by starykh and co - authors@xcite .",

    "of course , there is no unique way of doing this and for cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 the different possibilities have been classified by zhou and wen @xcite using the projective symmetry group associated with the mean - field decouplings @xcite .",
    "one disadvantage of the representation ( [ eq : pseudofermion ] ) is that the fermionic hilbert space contains two unphysical states per lattice site , corresponding to empty and doubly occupied sites . in order to describe the physical spin system ,",
    "these unphysical states must be projected out . according to popov and fedotov @xcite ,",
    "this can be done by formally imposing on the system a fictitious imaginary chemical potential @xmath49 . in frequency space , this is equivalent to replacing the fermionic matsubara frequencies @xmath50 by semionic ones , @xmath51 . if no further approximations are made , the semionic matsubara frequencies automatically eliminate the unphysical states from the fermionic hilbert space . recently",
    ", this procedure has been used@xcite to study the triangular lattice antiferromagnet by means of a diagrammatic monte carlo method . to avoid the complications associated with an imaginary chemical potential , it is sometimes sufficient to implement the projection only on average , which formally amounts to setting @xmath52 .",
    "unfortunately , at finite temperature this approximation can introduce uncontrollable errors @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall use a different fermionic representation based on majorana fermions ; introducing for each lattice site @xmath30 three majorana fermions @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 satisfying the anticommutation relations @xmath56 the spin algebra can be reproduced by setting@xcite @xmath57 note that with our normalization @xmath58 .",
    "the above majorana representation has been used previously by several authors to study quantum spin systems @xcite . moreover",
    ", a coherent state path integral for the majorana fermions can be constructed @xcite so that the usual field theoretical methods can be used to study the underlying spin model .",
    "an advantage of the above majorana representation is that it does not introduce any unphysical states . on the other hand , for a system consisting of an even number @xmath59 of spins , the majorana hilbert space has @xmath60 states and consists of @xmath61 identical copies of the @xmath62-dimensional spin hilbert space@xcite . for our mean - field calculation",

    "<S> we also show that for small magnetic fields the specific heat and the spin susceptibility both exhibit a maximum as a function of temperature at @xmath6 . in the spin - liquid regime , the majorana fermions can only propagate along the direction of the strongest bond , in agreement with the dimensional reduction scenario advanced by balents [ nature ( london ) * 464 * , 199 ( 2010 ) ] .    </S>",
