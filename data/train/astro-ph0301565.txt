    "@xcite ) , er uma stars have extremely short @xmath1 ( 1950 d , for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "only five definite members have been discovered : er uma ( @xcite ) ; v1159 ori ( @xcite ) ; rz lmi ( @xcite ) ; di uma ( @xcite ) ; and ix dra ( @xcite ) .    from the theoretical standpoint ,",
    "er uma stars pose difficult and interesting problems .",
    "the outburst mechanism of su uma - type dwarf novae is now widely believed to be a combination of thermal and tidal instabilities in the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "a smooth extension of su uma - type dwarf novae toward higher mass - transfer rates ( @xmath0 ) seems to be a natural explanation of extremely short @xmath1 in er uma stars @xcite .",
    "this explanation , however , requires a poorly understood mechanism to prematurely quench superoutbursts to reproduce the extremely short @xmath1 ( @xmath219 d ) in rz lmi @xcite .",
    "the origin of the supposed high mass - transfer rates is also a mystery , since the mass - transfer is mainly driven by gravitational wave radiation in su uma - type dwarf novae , within the standard evolutionary framework of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) ( @xcite ; for recent reviews of cv evolution , see @xcite ) .",
    "several attempts have been made to ascribe such a high @xmath0 to a nova - induced enhancement of mass - transfer ( originally discussed in @xcite in the context of `` nova hibernation '' scenario : @xcite ) .",
    "recent model calculations , however , have not been successful to reproduce the supposed wide @xmath0 diversity in short - period systems to which er uma stars belong @xcite .",
    "an irradiation - induced , cyclic mass - transfer variation has been shown to be also less effective in short - period systems ( @xcite , see also a general discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "most recently , several ideas have been proposed to explain the unusual outburst properties of er uma stars .",
    "@xcite proposed an idea to explain the er uma - type phenomenon by considering a decoupling between the thermal and tidal instabilities .",
    "@xcite tried to explain the er uma - type phenomenon by introducing an inner truncation of the accretion disk and irradiation on the secondary star .",
    "these ideas either require a still poorly understood mechanism or an arbitrary parameter selection , which does not yet seem to reasonably reproduce observations @xcite .    from the observational side , the distribution of @xmath1 seems to be discontinuous between er uma stars and usual su uma - type dwarf novae ( c.f .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of the orbital periods ( @xmath3 ) or superhump periods ( @xmath4 ) of er uma stars strongly concentrates in a short - period region @xcite .",
    "these observational properties have raised the following central problems : ( 1 ) do er uma stars and usual su uma stars comprise a continuous distribution of @xmath1 ? and ( 2 ) are there long-@xmath3 ( or long-@xmath4 ) er uma stars ? these fundamental questions have not been yet answered .",
    "the second question is particular important because the working hypotheses by @xcite and @xcite either require a small binary mass - ratio ( @xmath5 = @xmath6/@xmath7 ) or a short orbital period , which would enable a weak tidal torque or a strong effect of irradiation , respectively .    from these motivations , a search for transitional objects between er uma stars and usual su uma - type stars , and long-@xmath3",
    "er uma stars has been undertaken .",
    "ci uma ( @xmath8 140 d ) was once claimed to be a transitional object @xcite , but the pattern of its outbursts is much more irregular than those of er uma stars .",
    "a short @xmath1 ( 89 d ) system , v503 cyg @xcite is also unusual in its infrequent normal outbursts .",
    "low - amplitude su uma - type dwarf nova , hs vir , which has similar properties to er uma stars in its high frequency of normal outbursts @xcite , has recently confirmed to have a long ( @xmath1 = 186 or 371 d , @xcite ) supercycle , which is unlike those of er uma stars .",
    "most recently , ss umi ( @xmath1 = 84.7 d , @xcite ) has been shown to be the shortest @xmath1 system having usual properties of su uma - type dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "a search for transitional objects or long-@xmath3 er uma has been unsuccessful .",
    "bf ara is a dwarf nova having a range of variability 13.6  ( 16.0p and a tentative classification of an ss cyg - type dwarf nova according to the 4-th edition of the general catalogue of variable stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite photometrically studied this object during an outburst , and recorded 0.25-mag variations which could be attributed to a superhump .",
    "however , because of the lack of a sufficiently long series of photometry and the lack of knowledge in the outburst properties , this object has been largely neglected in the past studies . in the most recent years",
    ", @xcite noticed the presence of a clear recurring periodicity of long outbursts ( likely superoutbursts ) . from an analysis of the visual observations reported to the vsnet collaboration",
    ", @xcite proposed a mean supercycle length of 83.4 d , on the presumed assumption that bf ara is an su uma - type dwarf nova .",
    "since this supercycle length broke the shortest record among usual su uma - type dwarf novae , bf ara has been regarded as a key object to study the borderline and the relation between usual su uma - type dwarf novae and er uma stars .",
    "the next important step has undoubtedly been an unambiguous detection of superhumps which authenticates bf ara as a genuine su uma - type dwarf nova .",

    "the best - established examples include wz sge - type dwarf novae ( su uma - type dwarf novae with very infrequent ( super)outbursts , see e.g. @xcite ) and related large - amplitude systems ( v1028 cyg : @xcite ; sw uma : @xcite ; wx cet : @xcite ) .",
    "since all of these objects have short orbital periods , small @xmath5 , and small @xmath0 , there has been a suggestion that either @xmath5 or low @xmath0 is responsible for the period increase @xcite .",
    "the most recent discoveries of long - period ( thus likely large @xmath5 ) , and likely low-@xmath0 su uma - type dwarf novae ( v725 aql : @xcite ; ef peg : k. matsumoto et al , in preparation , see also @xcite ) , having zero or marginally positive @xmath28 , have more preferred the interpretation requiring a low @xmath0 .    the present discovery of a virtually zero @xmath24 in a long - period ( @xmath4 = 0.08797(1 ) d ) , otherwise relatively normal , system is therefore surprising .",
    "this discovery has not only strengthened the previously neglected diversity of @xmath28 in long - period su uma - type systems claimed in @xcite , but also provides a new clue to understand the physics of superhump period changes .    since bf ara has short outburst recurrence times ( both superoutbursts and normal outbursts ) , @xmath0 is expected to high @xcite . by using typical supercycles of bf ara",
    "( 84.3 d ) and v725 aql ( @xmath2900 d ) , the expected @xmath0 in bf ara is @xmath210 times larger than that in v725 aql @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of nearly zero @xmath28 systems in a wide region of @xmath0 implies that the interpretation requiring a low @xmath0 would be no longer valid , or a different mechanism is responsible for bf ara .",
    "@xcite recently suggested that the ( prograde ) apsidal motion of the eccentric disk can be reduced by introducing pressure forces .",
    "a high @xmath0 in bf ara may have modified the usual time - evolution of superhump period through this pressure effect .",
    "if this is the case , we can expect a more prominent effect in er uma stars , although a limited @xmath28 measurement @xcite failed to allow us a definitive conclusion .",
    "further observations of @xmath28 in more systems with a wide range of parameters are definitely needed .",
