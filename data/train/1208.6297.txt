    "the primary goal of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern in geneva , switzerland is to confirm or reject the existence of a higgs boson .",
    "since both the atlas and cms collaborations have observed a higgs boson - like particle with mass of around 126 gev at a significance of @xmath4 earlier this year , the goal seems to have been reached @xcite .",
    "apart from searches for the higgs boson , there is an ongoing hunt for signals of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) at the lhc , and hopefully these experiments will shed some light on physics at the tev scale .    one popular way to extend the sm is by increasing the number of space - time dimensions and it turns out that it is only possible to increase the number of spatial dimensions .",
    "the idea of extra dimensions originates from theodor kaluza and oskar klein in the 1920s @xcite .",
    "however , these theories were forgotten for decades until the 1980s , when extra - dimensional models had a revival at the birth of string theory . at the beginning of the new millennium ,",
    "several extra - dimensional models had been established , that eventually can be detected in future high - energy collider experiments .",
    "these models have some nice properties such as providing a good dark matter candidate as well as the answers to the hierarchy problem and the problem of proton stability @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we study a model with universal extra dimensions ( ueds ) , where the sm fields are allowed to propagate through the extra , spatial dimensions .",
    "this will give rise to an infinite tower of heavy kaluza  klein ( kk ) modes corresponding to each sm particle .",
    "the first ued model , which was introduced in 2000 by appelquist , dobrescu , and cheng , has one extra dimension compactified on a circle @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we will study a six - dimensional ued model @xcite .",
    "the kk modes interact with the sm particles and , given that the kk modes are at the tev scale , they will therefore affect the renormalization group ( rg ) running of physical parameters in the ued model . the logarithmic behavior of the rg running in the sm will change to a power - law behavior in the extra - dimensional model @xcite .",
    "rg running in extra - dimensional models has been extensively studied , see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of a few rare phenomena , that requires beyond sm physics and actually has been established , is that of neutrino oscillations , which indicate that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed .",
    "in contrast to other leptonic masses in the sm , the neutrino masses can not be generated through the higgs mechanism .",
    "it is thus impossible to describe the neutrino masses with the particle content of the sm , and some kind of new physics is required . in this work ,",
    "we extend the six - dimensional ued model with a dimension - five weinberg operator , which generates the neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ued ] , we discuss the six - dimensional ued model and present the renormalization group equation ( rge ) for the effective neutrino mass operator . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : rgrunning ] , we discuss rg running in extra - dimensions in general .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : rghiggs ] , we use the vacuum stability criterion , and the recent higgs mass results , of the higgs self - coupling constant in order to put constraints on the six - dimensional ued model .",
    "furthermore , in sec .  [ sec : rgmixing ] , we discuss the running of the leptonic mixing angles in the six - dimensional ued model . finally , in sec .  [",
    "sec : summary ] , we summarize and present our conclusions .",
    "in addition , in appendix [ sec : app ] , we also provide the @xmath0-functions to one - loop order in the six - dimensional ued model .",
    "the extra dimensions in the ued model are flat and compactified .",
    "all sm fields are allowed to propagate through these extra dimensions . from our four - dimensional point of view",
    "they are perceived as an infinite tower of heavy kk modes corresponding to each sm particle , which , in turn , is identified with the zero - mode component .",
    "we consider a six - dimensional minimal ued model , with two extra , spatial dimensions , compactified on a so - called chiral square of side length @xmath5 , which has the adjacent sides identified .",
    "a compactification radius @xmath6 is defined , and in this work , we will use the value @xmath7 tev , which is within the bounds on the size of the extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the chiral square is equivalent to the @xmath8 orbifold .",
    "we obtain a new conserved parity called kk parity .",
    "it is defined as @xmath9 for the kk level with the kk numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 and sm particles have kk numbers @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "six - dimensional fermions have chiralities which are denoted @xmath14 .",
    "the compactification is chosen so that the six - dimensional fermionic fields with @xmath15 chirality have left - handed zero - mode components @xcite .",
    "hence , corresponding to a six - dimensional fermionic field with @xmath15 chirality , there is a tower of kk modes with chirality @xmath16 , which has a zero - mode component , and also a tower of chirality @xmath17 , without a zero - mode component . for the right - handed sm fermions ,",
    "the expansions are given by interchanging @xmath18 and @xmath19 as well as @xmath15 and @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , corresponding to each six - dimensional gauge field is a four - dimensional gauge field with a zero - mode component and two towers of real scalars , called adjoint scalars . by a suitable choice of expansion , these scalars will not have zero - mode components , but they do appear at the excited kk levels .",
    "the new kk particles interact with the sm particles , and hence , we obtain additional vertices involving the new fermionic fields and the adjoint scalars .    in order to obtain neutrino masses in this model , we introduce a dimension - five weinberg operator , where two higgs doublets are combined as an isospin triplet @xcite .",
    "this is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a symmetric and complex matrix of mass dimension @xmath23 in flavor space , @xmath5 denotes the lepton doublet fields , and @xmath24 the higgs doublet fields .",
    "this operator can be generated through seesaw mechanisms .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "in ued models , the @xmath0-function for the neutrino mass matrix can be written on the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the sm contribution to the @xmath0-function and @xmath30 are the contributions from the excited kk modes .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 counts the number of kk levels contributing to the total @xmath0-function , i.e.  the number of kk levels that fulfills @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a given energy and @xmath34 is the energy for which the first kk mode is excited .",
    "the contribution @xmath29 has been calculated elsewhere , see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite , and it is given by @xmath35\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 where the matrices @xmath37 @xmath38 are the yukawa couplings for the charged leptons , the up - type quarks , and the down - type quarks .",
    "furthermore , the quantities @xmath39 @xmath40 are the gauge couplings and @xmath41 is the higgs self - coupling constant .",
    "the second contribution to the @xmath0-function , @xmath30 , comes from the excited kk modes .",
    "this contribution has been calculated in the six - dimensional ued model with the following result @xmath42.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is a difference between eqs .   and , which is due to the new feynman diagrams involving the new fermions and the adjoint scalars .",
    "the difference in the coefficients in front of the gauge couplings squared is due to the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : newdiagrams ] , whereas the factor of 2 in front of @xmath43 is based on new yukawa - type interactions involving the new fermions at excited kk levels .",
    "the @xmath0-functions for the yukawa matrices are listed in appendix  [ sec : app ] .",
    "the physical parameters are measured in low - energy scale experiments .",
    "therefore , we need to take into account the effects of rg running when studying the parameters at high - energy scales @xcite .",
    "all models with @xmath44 dimensions are inherently non - renormalizable .",
    "however , the theory can preserve its renormalizability if an energy cutoff , @xmath45 , is introduced @xcite .",
    "below @xmath45 , the model is renormalizable and there we can thus treat it as an effective four - dimensional model .",
    "the energy cutoff implies that only a finite number of kk modes , namely the ones with energies between @xmath46 , where the first mode is excited , and @xmath45 , contributes to the renormalization group ( rg ) running . above @xmath45 , an unknown , renormalizable ultraviolet completion is assumed to step in .",
    "hence , the extra dimensions will affect the rg running of the physical parameters in the model . instead of the logarithmic running that we have in the sm , the extra dimensions give rise to a power - law behavior of the rg running @xcite .",
    "thus , it ought to be possible to distinguish the rg running in the ued model from that in the sm in the near future .",
    "the contributions from the sm particles and the kk modes to the @xmath0-functions are different and independent .",
    "therefore , they can be described in two separate terms and the rges for a quantity @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the sm @xmath0-function and @xmath50 is the contribution from the kk modes at each kk level .",
    "we have assumed that the particle contents at each kk level are identical , except for the particle masses , and therefore that their contributions to the @xmath0-function are the same .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 counts the number of kk levels contributing to the total @xmath0-function .",
    "below @xmath51 , where the first kk mode is excited , is the running logarithmic , since only the sm particles contribute to the @xmath0-function . as the energy increases from @xmath51 to @xmath45 , the energy threshold for successive modes are crossed , and",
    "thus , an increasing number of kk modes comes into play . for energies fulfilling @xmath52 , the contributions from the kk modes will dominate and the rg running will have a power - law dependence .",
    "first , we investigate the bounds on the higgs self - coupling from the vacuum stability criterion .",
    "bounds on the five- and six - dimensional ued models from lhc data have previously been studied in refs .",
    "we have calculated the rges for the higgs self - coupling , @xmath41 , in the six - dimensional ued model and they are presented in eqs .  .",
    "the rg running of @xmath41 can be used to put constraints on this model .",
    "depending on the initial conditions , there are two possible scenarios , which limit the stability region of @xmath41 .",
    "either it approaches the triviality limit , where it diverges , or the vacuum stability limit , where the value of @xmath41 becomes negative and the higgs potential becomes unstable . for the higgs mass , we use the mass recently determined by the atlas and cms collaborations , @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "this mass is in the low - mass region , and therefore only the triviality limit is an issue .    we have solved the full set of rges numerically , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgs ] , we present the bounds on @xmath54 as a function of @xmath46 from the vacuum stability criterion of the higgs self - coupling constant .",
    "the product @xmath54 counts the number of kk modes below the cutoff scale , i.e.  the number contributing to the rges .",
    "the mass of the top quark , @xmath55 , is only known with a precision of a few gev and it affects the bounds on the model .",
    "here we have used @xmath56 @xcite . the weakest limit on the number of kk modes contributing",
    "is given at 1 tev and even there only five modes are in the energy range and thus can contribute , i.e.  the modes with kk numbers @xmath57 , which is a severe constraint on the validity of the extra - dimensional model .",
    "this result is in line with the five - dimensional case , which has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only five kk modes were allowed from the vacuum stability criterion .",
    "note that our results are based on the @xmath0-functions calculated to one - loop order .",
    "hence , there may be small changes due to higher - order corrections .     as a function of @xmath46 for a higgs mass of @xmath53 from the vacuum stability criterion for the higgs self - coupling constant .",
    "the band is due to the uncertainty in the top quark mass , which is in the range @xmath56 , and the strongest bound is due to the largest mass . ]",
    "we will proceed our discussion to the rg running of the neutrino parameters , and more specifically to the running of the leptonic mixing angles . in order to determine the rg running of the mixing angles , we use the standard parametrization , where the mixing matrix , @xmath58 , is parametrized in terms of three mixing angles , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 and three cp - violating phases , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . the value of @xmath2 is non - zero in contrast to what has been previously expected .",
    "in fact , it has a comparatively large value @xmath62 at @xmath63 confidence level @xcite .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath2 strongly disfavors the bimaximal and tri - bimaximal mixing patterns .",
    "several global fits have been performed to the experimental results from neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "we have taken the values of the neutrino mixing parameters at @xmath64 , being the @xmath65 boson mass , from ref .",
    "it should however be pointed out that our results are rather independent of the global fit used .",
    "the standard parametrization of the mixing matrix is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "in the present work , we will assume @xmath70 .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix can then be diagonalized by @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath40 are the neutrino masses",
    ". there are two possible orderings of the neutrino masses , which are in agreement with experimental data .",
    "normal hierarchy , where @xmath73 , or inverted hierarchy , where @xmath74 .",
    "the neutrino mass scale is yet unknown , but there are upper bounds on the neutrino masses coming from tritium beta decay experiments , i.e.  @xmath75 ev @xcite .",
    "these bounds will most probably be improved by one order of magnitude by the katrin experiment @xcite .",
    "apart from direct bounds , there are also indirect constraints from cosmological data , such as the cmb data of the wmap experiment , which are more severe and put an upper limit on the sum of the neutrino masses @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we will assume @xmath76 ev",
    ".    in the numerical analysis , the full set of rges have been used , these are given in appendix [ sec : app ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : angles ] , we display the running of the neutrino mixing angles as functions of the energy in the cases of normal and inverted hierarchy . the mixing angle @xmath1 has the most significant rg dependence , in both normal and inverted hierarchies , and in accordance with other extra - dimensional models , the rg running exhibits a power - law behavior .",
    "neither @xmath2 nor @xmath3 exhibits any significant rg running in either case .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the direction of the small running depends on the mass hierarchy for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the value increases ( decreases ) in case of normal ( inverted ) hierarchy . in both hierarchies ,",
    "it is possible that @xmath77 close to the cutoff scale if @xmath1 is large and @xmath3 is small at @xmath64 , which would imply a bimaximal mixing pattern , however with a non - zero @xmath2 .",
    "the rg running of the mixing angles in the five - dimensional ued model was discussed in ref .",
    "the rg running is similar in both cases .",
    "the only mixing angle that exhibits any significant rg running is @xmath1 , and furthermore , @xmath2 and @xmath3 run in the same direction for the respective hierarchies .",
    "it turns out that the main difference between the two models is the cutoff scale , which in the five - dimensional model is taken to be @xmath78 tev , which is significantly larger than in the six - dimensional case , where @xmath79 tev .",
    "hence , the six - dimensional model ought to be detectable in a closer future .",
    "furthermore , the low value of @xmath41 means that the energy required for unification of the gauge parameters can not be attained .",
    "the cut - off energy in the present six - dimensional ued model is comparatively low , and therefore , neutrino mass operators of mass dimension @xmath80 might change the rg running of the neutrino masses .",
    "a classification of such operators has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and they can be generated in so - called radiative models . at one - loop order , i.e.  of mass dimension @xmath81 , there are seven such operators e.g.@xmath82 certainly , such operators will change the @xmath0-function for the neutrino mass operator , and could indeed give rise to both qualitative and quantitative differences in the rg running compared to the situation without including any higher - order mass operators .",
    "thus , by adding more mass operators , we would change the original model , and such a study lies beyond the scope of this work .",
    "note that other studies of higher - order mass operators have been made in e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", no study of the effects of higher - order mass operators in the context of ueds has yet been performed .",
    "in this work , we have studied the rg running of physical parameters in a six - dimensional ued model , extended by a dimension - five effective neutrino mass operator .",
    "we have specifically derived the rges for the yukawa couplings , the effective neutrino mass operator , and the higgs self - coupling in this model .",
    "furthermore , we have studied the rg evolution of the leptonic mixing angles numerically , and found that the angle @xmath1 shows the most sizable running and is always increasing , independent of the mass ordering .",
    "the rg corrections to the mixing angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 are negligible .",
    "it can , however , be noted that the direction of the running is in their case dependent on the mass hierarchy .",
    "the values of both mixing angles are increasing , albeit only a little , for normal ordering , and decreasing for inverted ordering .",
    "finally , we have used the new value of the higgs mass determined at the lhc and the vacuum stability criterion to set a bound on the extra - dimensional model .",
    "it turns out that only five kk modes are allowed to contribute , which severely limits the validity of the ued model and puts a severe limitation on the value of the cut - off as well .",
    "in particular , it means that the energy required for unification of the gauge couplings is not reached within this model .",
