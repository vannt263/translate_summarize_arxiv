    "an algol binary is a semidetached binary system consisting of ( 1 ) an early type , main sequence primary component which does not fill its roche lobe , and ( 2 ) a lobe - filling , less massive star that is substantially above the main sequence .",
    "the less massive star is cooler , fainter and larger @xcite .",
    "it is believed that star ( 2 ) is initially more massive , and evolves first to overflow its roche lobe to transfer mass to star ( 1 ) .",
    "after the rapid mass exchange , the lobe - filling star ( 2 ) becomes less massive in the algol binary stage .",
    "the evolution of algol binaries has been investigated extensively ( e.g. , plavec 1968 ; paczynski 1971 ; refsdal & weigert 1969 ) .",
    "although conservative mass transfer seems to roughly reproduce the observed characteristics of a considerable fraction of algol binaries ( e.g. nelson & eggleton 2001 ; de loore & van rensbergen 2004 ) , nonconservative evolution with mass and orbital angular momentum loss taken into account is required for better comparison between theories and observations ( thomas 1977 ; refsdal et al .",
    "1974 ; sarna 1993 ) . with regard to the orbital evolution , conservative mass transfer in algol binaries leads to increase of the orbital periods because mass is transferred from the less massive star to the more massive component ( huang 1963 ) .",
    "however , there is strong evidence showing that the orbital periods of some algol binaries are actually decreasing @xcite .",
    "although it is uncertain whether the measured period changes are long - term ( secular ) changes or transient fluctuations , they clearly demonstrate that these systems must undergo mass and angular momentum loss during the evolution .",
    "moreover , @xcite find that the decreasing rates @xmath0 scale with the orbital periods @xmath1 roughly as @xmath2 .",
    "this orbital decay may be explained by angular - momentum loss via magnetic stellar winds @xcite .",
    "sarna , muslimov , & yerli ( 1997 ) and sarna , yerli , & muslimov ( 1998 ) proposed that dynamo action can occur in mass - losing stars in algol - type binaries , and produce large - scale magnetic fields , which lead to magnetic braking of the stars .",
    "however , there could exist some potential difficulties for the magnetic braking mechanism ( see below ) . here",
    "we suggest an alternative interpretation assuming that a small fraction of the transferred mass would form a circumbinary ( cb ) disk surrounding the binary system ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "previous works @xcite have already indicated that the cb disk can efficiently remove the orbital angular momentum and accelerate the binary evolution in accreting white dwarf or neutron star binaries .",
    "we describe the input physics that is necessary for the evolution model in section 2 .",
    "numerically calculated results for the evolutionary sequences of algol binaries in two cases are presented in section 3 .",
    "we make brief discussion and conclude in section 4 .",
    "we consider an algol binary consisting of a lobe - filling , less massive star ( of mass @xmath3 ) , and an early type , more massive companion ( of mass @xmath4 ) .",
    "the total orbital angular momentum of the system in a circular orbit is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the binary separation and @xmath7 is the reduced mass of the binary system , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the gravitational constant and the total mass of system , respectively .",
    "we neglect the spin angular momentum of the components because it is smaller compared with the total orbital angular momentum of the system .",
    "similar to @xcite , in the calculations we consider two types of mechanisms for orbital angular momentum loss from the binary system , which are described as follows .",
    "@xcite point out that single low - mass main - sequence stars will undergo braking by the coupling between the magnetic field and the stellar winds .",
    "the magnetic braking mechanism assumes that the ionized particles stream out along the magnetic field lines which come off the convection envelope of the stars .",
    "the loss of the specific angular momentum in the stellar winds is very large because the outflowing material is tied in the magnetic field lines to corotate with the stars out to a long distance ( @xmath10 stellar radii ) @xcite . in an algol binary ,",
    "the angular momentum loss of the evolved star by magnetic braking cause it to spin down .",
    "however , the tidal forces of the system will continuously act to spin the evolved star up back into corotation with the orbital rotation .",
    "the spin up takes place with the expense of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "hence magnetic braking indirectly carries away the orbital angular momentum of the binary system .",
    "the mass loss due to the magnetic winds during the mass transfer is generally very small , so we can assume that the total mass is conserved , and the orbital evolution is connected to the angular momentum loss rate and the mass transfer rate as follows @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass ratio , and @xmath13 is the angular momentum loss rate due to magnetic braking , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a dimensionless parameter in the range from 0 to 4 , and @xmath16 is the angular velocity of the star ( rappaport et al . 1983 ) . since @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 2 ) always causes the orbit to increase .",
    "orbital shrinkage occurs only when the magnitude of the first term is larger than that of the second one , i.e. , @xmath19 one can show that with the magnetic braking law of rappaport et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , the orbital decay rates with eq .  ( 4 ) are several orders lower than the observed ones . moreover , from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we can derive the following relation , @xmath20 where we have used the relation for the radius of the lobe - filling star @xmath21^{1/3}a$ ] with @xmath22 ( paczynski 1971 ) . as we can see , only when @xmath23 can we have a positive correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "more recent studies based on observations of rapidly rotating stars show that the above magnetic braking form may be inadequate @xcite .",
    "@xcite instead propose an empirical angular momentum loss prescription @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the critical angular velocity at which the angular momentum loss rate reaches a saturated state , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath31 and @xmath32 in solar units , respectively .",
    "@xcite suggest that @xmath28 is inversely proportional to the convective turbulent timescale in the star at 200 myr age , @xmath33 the magnitude of @xmath13 under this magnetic braking law is at least one order of magnitude smaller than that in the rappaport et al .",
    "( 1983 ) model with @xmath34 ( andronov et al .",
    "2003 ) , suggesting that more efficient angular momentum loss mechanism may be required to account for the orbit decay in algol binaries .",
    "once roche lobe overflow occurs in semidetached binaries , some fraction of the transferred material may leave the system in various ways . the mass outflow in cataclysmic variables ( cvs )",
    "was noticed by @xcite from the studies of uv and optical resonance lines .",
    "mass loss can also lead to orbital decrease in mass exchanging binaries .",
    "we first consider the case that a fraction @xmath35 of the transferred matter is lost from the binary system , carrying away the specific angular momentum of the secondary star @xcite .",
    "the change rate of orbital period can be written as @xmath36.\\ ] ] to account for the secular decreasing of orbital period , the mass loss fraction @xmath35 from the binary system should satisfy @xmath37 for @xmath38 , it requires @xmath39 .",
    "apparently this is impossible .",
    "hence angular momentum loss via simple mass loss can not interpret the orbital shrinking of some algol binaries with low mass ratio .    in a theoretical view",
    ", @xcite proposed that part of the outflow may be in the form of a slow wind near the orbital plane .",
    "it has been argued that during mass exchange the lost matter may form a disk structure surrounding the binary system rather than leave the binary system @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite suggested that a keplerian cb disk could be formed as a result of mass outflow in cvs .",
    "the cb disk can extract the orbital angular momentum from th binary orbit through tidal torques .",
    "since the mass transfer processes are similar in cvs as in algol binaries , we assume that a constant fraction @xmath35 of the transferred mass feeds into the cb disk surrounding the algol system , and @xmath40 ( if the mass transfer rate is sub - eddington ) .",
    "same as in the standard thin accretion disks , the viscous torque in the cb disk is @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the viscosity , @xmath43 the radius , @xmath44 the surface density , and @xmath45^{1/2}$ ] the local orbital angular velocity in the disk .    assume that the gravitational interaction of the binary with the disk occurs locally at the inner edge @xmath46 of the disk ] , angular momentum from the binary feeds into the disk at a rate proportional to the surface density @xmath47 .",
    "the viscous torque exerted by the cb disk on the binary can be shown to be @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the mass transfer time , and @xmath51 is a parameter determined by the viscosity .",

    "we take @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows that the cb disk presents a plausible mechanism removing the orbital angular momentum to explain the decrease of the orbital periods for reasonable values of @xmath75 ( or @xmath35 ) .",
    "generally a larger @xmath75 is required for a smaller @xmath76 .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines show two examples of algol binary evolution , revealing how the orbital period evolution depends on the initial parameters . as seen from eq .",
    "( 14 ) , the larger orbit , the larger angular momentum loss rate via the cb disk .",
    "this naturally results in a positive correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in this section we present the results of numerical calculations of the algol binary evolutions in two typical cases .",
    "we have adopted an updated version of the evolution code developed by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we consider both the angular momentum loss mechanisms described in section 2 , adopting the modified magnetic braking law ( eqs .",
    "[ 6]-[7 ] ) for evolved stars with mass @xmath79 .",
    "we take solar chemical compositions ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ) for both stars , and the ratio of the mixing length to the pressure scale height to be 2.0 .    _",
    "( 1 ) initial masses @xmath83 and orbital period @xmath84 days _    in a proto - algol system with initial orbital period @xmath85 days , the more massive star will fill its roche lobe when it is still on the main sequence .",
    "this kind of case a binary evolution has been investigated extensively ( e.g. , eggleton 2000 ) . here",
    "we calculate the evolutionary sequences for a binary with initial masses @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and the initial orbital period @xmath88 days , assuming that a small fraction @xmath35 ( @xmath89 , 0.005 ) of the transferred mass forms a cb disk surrounding the system . figure 2 shows the mass ratio , the orbital period and the mass transfer rate as a function of the time of mass transfer .",
    "it is clear that the mass transfer proceeds initially on short ( @xmath90 myr ) , thermal - timescale , then on a much longer ( hundreds of myr ) nuclear - timescale when @xmath17 , this is why we usually observe less massive donor stars in algol binaries .",
    "the orbital period first decreases until @xmath91 .",
    "its further evolution depends on the effect of orbital angular momentum loss by the cb disk . when @xmath92 the evolution is similar as the conservative evolution with continuously increasing orbital period .",
    "when @xmath93 the angular momentum loss is strong enough that at @xmath94 , @xmath1 turns to decrease .",
    "the second orbital decay phase occupies most of the mass transfer lifetime . in both cases",
    "the mass transfer rates have a peak values @xmath95 at the beginning of roche lobe overflow , then last a plateau phase @xmath96 myr .",
    "it is also noted that , in both cases the mass transfer rates reach a peak when @xmath97 yr , indicating that the cb disk - induced angular momentum loss begins accelerating the mass transfer .",
    "( the evolution of @xmath75 was plotted against the mass ratio @xmath76 with the dotted curve in fig .  1 . )    _ ( 2 ) initial masses @xmath98 and orbital period @xmath99 days _    the calculated results for a relative wide system with @xmath100 days and @xmath101 , 0.015 are presented in fig .",
    "3 . compared with those in fig .  2 , the mass transfer rates are much higher , and the evolutionary timescale is smaller by a factor more than 100 , suggesting that these systems are less likely to be observed .",
    "for both values of @xmath35 , the orbital period shows a transition from decrease to increase when @xmath102 .",
    "the phases of orbit shrinkage last about @xmath103 of the total mass transfer lifetime .",
    "when @xmath104 , the mass transfer rate somewhat fluctuates during the late stages of the evolution though we have smoothed the mass transfer rate for clarity .",
    "the calculated evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram are plotted in fig .",
    "the bold curves denote the phases in which the orbital period decreases . for comparison with observations",
    ", we also show the locations of four algol systems which have decreasing orbital periods and well - measured parameters summarized in table 1 .",
    "as shown in the figure , the calculated results are roughly in accordance with the observations , suggesting that they may represent the possible evolutionary sequences that lead to the formation of these systems .",
    "figure 5 compares the calculated results of algol binary evolution with the observational data in the @xmath105 plane .",
    "it seems that our model is also compatible with the observed spectral types of the four systems .",
    "it is an open question why some of the algol systems show orbital shrinkage while others not .",
    "although it is generally believed that there must be orbital angular momentum loss during the evolution of these binaries , the appropriate mechanism(s ) for angular momentum loss has not been verified .",
    "based on theoretical model of @xcite and @xcite , we suggest that a cb disk may play an important role in determining the orbital change in algol systems . note that our cb disk hypothesis does not exclude the effect of ( magnetized ) mass loss . on the contrary , the formation of the cb disk may be closely related to the mass loss processes in the binary evolution .",
    "the existence of the cb disks may be revealed by their infrared radiation , as in gg tau @xcite .",
    "the monte - carlo simulation by @xcite has reproduced the morphology of the near ir radiation which is in accord with the observations by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have calculated the evolutionary sequence for algol binaries with typical masses and orbital periods , taking into account both magnetic braking and the cb disk .",
    "the detailed calculations indicate that the orbital evolution of algol binaries can be significantly affected by the cb disk , especially for case a mass transfer . with adequate values of @xmath35 , it is possible to account for the decrease of the orbital periods in some algol binaries .",
    "in addition , the existence of cb disk can accelerate the evolution and enhance the mass transfer rates , as already noticed in the evolutionary study of cvs @xcite .",
    "this suggests a plausible explanation for the rapid mass transfer observed in a few algol binaries with very low mass ratios @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the magnitude of the mass feeding parameter @xmath35 is highly uncertain , let alone its variation with the mass transfer rates .",
    "these uncertainties make it difficult to present direct comparison between observations and theoretical predications for algol binaries .",
    "however , our analysis provides a reasonable mechanism for angular momentum loss in semi - detached binaries including algol binaries .",
    "more detailed multi - wavelength observations can provide stringent tests for the cb disk model , and the theories of the evolution of algol binaries .",
