    "a positive integer @xmath0 is called a congruent number if there exists a right triangle with rational sides and area equal to @xmath0 , i.e. , there exist @xmath4 with @xmath5 it is easy to decide whether there is a right triangle of given area and integral sides ( thanks to euclid s characterization of the pythagorean triples ) .",
    "the case of rational sides , known as the congruent number problem , is not completely understood .",
    "fibonacci showed that @xmath6 is a congruent number ( since one may take @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "fermat found that @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not congruent numbers .",
    "hence , there is no perfect square amongst the congruent numbers since otherwise the corresponding rational triangle would be similar to one with area equal to @xmath10 . by the same reason one can restrict to square - free positive integers , a condition we will assume in the sequel .",
    "there is a fruitful translation of the congruent number problem into the language of elliptic curves .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a congruent number .",
    "it follows from ( [ one ] ) that there exist three squares in arithmetic progression of distance @xmath0 , namely @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "therefore their product @xmath15 is again a rational square . in other words , a right triangle of area @xmath0 and rational sides @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 corresponds to the rational point @xmath19 on the elliptic curve @xmath20 conversely , given a rational point @xmath21 on @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , one may define @xmath24 to obtain a right triangle with rational sides @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and area @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 is a congruent number if and only if the elliptic curve @xmath22 has a rational point with non - vanishing @xmath25-coordinate .",
    "the correspondence between rational points on @xmath22 and right triangles with rational sides and area @xmath0 is not bijective .",
    "for instance , solving @xmath26 and @xmath25 with respect to @xmath27 and @xmath18 in equation ( [ two ] ) gives the two points @xmath28    the points @xmath21 with @xmath23 have infinite order in the mordell - weil group @xmath29 , since it is known ( see @xcite ) that the torsion subgroup of @xmath29 consists only of points of order @xmath11 , that are @xmath30 , and the point at infinity . from this one",
    "can deduce the fact , already known to fermat , that there are in fact infinitely many right triangles with rational sides @xmath31 verifying equation ( [ one ] ) for a given congruent number @xmath0 , since scalar multiplication of the points corresponding to ( [ three ] ) on @xmath22 yields new right triangles of area @xmath0 .",
    "tunnell @xcite found an intruiging approach towards the congruent number problem .",
    "he showed that if @xmath0 is an odd square - free congruent number then @xmath32 and that the converse implication is also true provided the yet unsolved birch & swinnerton - dyer conjecture holds ( i.e. , the rank of an elliptic curve @xmath33 is positive if and only if the associated @xmath34-function vanishes at the central point : @xmath35 ) .",
    "a similar criterion exists when @xmath0 is even .",
    "this conjectural equivalent statement for the congruent number problem in terms of the number of representations of @xmath0 by certain ternary quadratic forms allows to determine by computation whether a given integer @xmath0 is congruent or not .",
    "a natural generalization of the congruent number problem is to allow the sides of the triangles to belong to an algebraic number field .",
    "the idea to study the congruent number problem over algebraic extensions dates back at least to tada @xcite who considered real quadratic fields .      note that @xmath38-congruent numbers are nothing but the usual congruent numbers .",
    "when @xmath36 is a subfield of @xmath39 the geometric meaning still holds , since @xmath0 being @xmath36-congruent implies the existence of a right triangle with real sides in @xmath36 and area equal to @xmath0 .    it is easy to see that any positive integer @xmath0 is a congruent number for some quadratic extension of @xmath38 .",
    "for instance , @xmath40 yields a right triangle with area equal to @xmath41 . however , equation ( [ three ] ) leads to the points @xmath42 on the curve @xmath43 which are all torsion points over @xmath44 .",
    "therefore we do not get infinitely many different right triangles from these points .",
    "this example motivates the following definition :            * proof*. consider the system @xmath47 substituting @xmath16 by @xmath48 in the first equation yields @xmath49 therefore @xmath50 it follows that @xmath0 is congruent over @xmath51 , where @xmath52 ( and @xmath17 is any chosen rational point ) .",
    "given such a triple @xmath53 , the corresponding @xmath51-rational point @xmath54 on the curve @xmath22 is given by ( [ three ] ) .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that the torsion subgroup of @xmath55 reduces to the 2-torsion , namely @xmath56 , except for the cases @xmath57 or @xmath58 .        since it is known that 1 and 11 are not @xmath61-congruent numbers",
    ", it follows that 1 is not @xmath63-congruent . according to the proof above",
    ", @xmath64 can not be of the form @xmath65 with @xmath66 for any choice of @xmath67 .",
    "that is , the genus 1 curve @xmath68 is not an elliptic curve over @xmath61 , i.e. it has no nonsingular @xmath61-rational point .",
    "the same argument applied to a general pair @xmath69 leads to the following generalization .",
    "denote by @xmath70 the genus 1 curve @xmath71 .",
    "then this curve has a @xmath38-rational point if and only if @xmath0 is @xmath72-congruent , or equivalently , if and only if @xmath62 is @xmath38-congruent .",
    "[ 3 ] every positive integer @xmath0 is properly congruent over some real cubic field . more precisely , for a positive integer @xmath0 let @xmath76 be the unique real solution of the cubic equation @xmath77 then the point @xmath78 with coordinates given by ( [ coord ] ) and ( [ coord1 ] ) below is of infinite order in the mordell - weil group of the elliptic curve @xmath3 over @xmath1 .    * proof*.",
    "we use an idea of chahal @xcite .",
    "starting from an old identity of desboves @xcite , @xmath79 the substitution @xmath80 yields @xmath81 this gives the point @xmath21 with coordinates @xmath82 on the elliptic curve @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "now let @xmath0 be a positive integer and consider the equation @xmath85 .",
    "it is easy to see that there is a unique real solution , explicitly given by @xmath86 where @xmath87{-8 - 27n^2 + 3\\sqrt{48n^2 + 81n^4}}.\\ ] ] here we choose @xmath88 as the unique real third root which is negative for all @xmath0 . by computation ,",
    "we obtain a point @xmath78 on @xmath89 , where the coordinates are given by @xmath90 this can be checked by use of a computer algebra package or by hand computation as follows : firstly , multiply the numerator and denominator of the coordinates ( [ tzt1 ] ) and ( [ tzt2 ] ) by the conjugates of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , then the coordinates are given as rational polynomials in the variable @xmath93 ; secondly , since @xmath1 is a cubic field , these polynomials turn out to have degree at most two , which yields ( [ coord ] ) and ( [ coord1 ] ) .",
    "it remains to show that the point @xmath2 has infinite order on @xmath89 .",
    "note that the map that sends @xmath21 to @xmath94 is an endomorphism on the elliptic curve @xmath22 , hence @xmath22 has complex multiplication by @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "there are bounds @xcite for the order of the subgroup of torsion points on a elliptic curve with complex multiplication defined over a number field .",
    "applying these results to the elliptic curve @xmath22 over the cubic number field @xmath1 we obtain that if @xmath96 is the order of a torsion point of @xmath89 , then @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is euler s @xmath98-function",
    ". therefore @xmath99 .",
    "hence it is sufficient to prove that the order of @xmath2 is not in @xmath100 . for this purpose",
    "we use the @xmath74-division polynomial @xmath101 associated with the elliptic curve @xmath22 .",
    "it suffices to check that @xmath102 is not a root of @xmath101 for @xmath103 over @xmath1 .",
    "we have @xmath104 where @xmath105 $ ] has no integer roots for @xmath106 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus @xmath107 for any integer @xmath0 and @xmath108 .",
    "this proves that @xmath109 has infinite order and so the mordell - weil group of @xmath110 has positive rank .",
    "the theorem is proved .",
    "the integer @xmath41 is a congruent number over the cubic field @xmath111 , where @xmath112{-35 + 3\\sqrt{129}}+{1\\over 3\\sqrt[3]{-35 + 3\\sqrt{129}}}.\\ ] ] the following picture shows a right triangle with area 1 and sides in @xmath111 :              we thank j. lehnert ( frankfurt ) for useful discussions and p. mller ( wrzburg ) for providing an alternative argument for theorem 3 .",
