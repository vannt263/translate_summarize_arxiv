    "quiver varieties , which were introduced by nakajima @xcite , stand at the corner of a beautiful interplay between combinatorics , geometry , representation theory , and mathematical physics .",
    "this expository paper has two purposes .",
    "the first one is to study quiver varieties of type @xmath2 from a combinatorial viewpoint (  2-4 ) .",
    "the second is to give a brief survey of recent developments of instanton counting in physics , especially results of maeda _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and to discuss combinatorial aspects of them (  5 ) .",
    "the goal in the first part is to compute poincar polynomials of quiver varieties in rank @xmath1 case via a combinatorial method .",
    "note that poincar polynomials of quiver varieties have already been obtained by nakajima ( see remark [ rem : nakajima ] ) , and our method just confirms his result .",
    "however , we hope that our combinatorial viewpoint gives a new insight into the subject .",
    "our strategy is as follows .",
    "there is natural torus actions on quiver varieties . then by localization principle",
    ", we can compute topologies of them by studying the fixed point set .",
    "we see that they further reduce to enumeration of young diagrams .",
    "more importantly , we compute the poincar polynomial of a quiver variety not one by one , but a _ generating function _ of them . for that purpose , we use some combinatorial machineries , which are _ cores _ and _ quotient _ of young diagrams . they arise from a division algorithm for young diagrams analogous to that for integers and play important roles in our discussions .",
    "they also appear in recent studies of supersymmetric gauge theories by maeda _",
    "@xcite ( in slightly different terminologies ) .",
    "the purpose of the second part is to explain it from a mathematical viewpoint .",
    "we hope that our exposition is also useful for physics oriented readers .",
    "we introduce quiver varieties of type @xmath2 as follows .",
    "let @xmath3 be a cyclic group of order @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath3 acts on the framed moduli space @xmath5 of torsion free sheaves @xmath6 on @xmath7 with rank @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where the framing is a trivialization at the line at infinity @xmath10 .",
    "we consider its @xmath3-fixed point components , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are isomorphism classes of @xmath3-modules .",
    "these @xmath14 s are _ quiver varieties of type _ @xmath2 .",
    "note that this definition , which is taken from @xcite , is slightly different from the original one .",
    "the original definition was based on the so - called adhm description of instantons on so - called ale spaces @xcite .    the space @xmath5 was also introduced by nakajima @xcite , as a resolution of the moduli space of instantons on @xmath15 .",
    "then quiver varieties can be seen as resolutions of the moduli spaces of instantons on @xmath16 .",
    "it turns out that generating functions of euler characteristics of quiver varieties can be identified with the partition functions of certain supersymmetric field theory , which is important in mathematical physics .",
    "this is one of our motivations to study quiver varieties .",
    "we summarize some basic facts of instanton counting in  5 . here",
    "we should mention a beautiful work by physicists fucito _ et al .",
    "they studied instanton moduli spaces on ale spaces by a combinatorial method .",
    "the present work grow out of an attempt at rigorous understanding of their idea mathematically . in this paper",
    ", we give a precise mathematical formulation of the idea in @xcite , and complete proofs to the results announced there .",
    "let us explain more detail about our analysis in the first part .",
    "there is a natural action of @xmath17-dimensional torus @xmath18 on a quiver variety @xmath14 , induced from that on @xmath5 .",
    "we study their fixed point sets . it can be shown that fixed points on a quiver variety @xmath14 are parametrized by a certain set @xmath19 of young diagrams , which is determined by the _ coloring of young diagrams _ ( see  2 for definition ) .",
    "then localization theorem tells us that we can compute euler characteristics of quiver varieties via enumeration of @xmath19 .",
    "we can also compute poincar polynomials by studying tangent spaces at fixed points . as mentioned above",
    ", what we want to compute is the generating function of them with respect to @xmath13 : @xmath20 the problem is that how to get a closed formula for @xmath21 . in  [ sub : euler ] , we give a closed formula for @xmath21 when @xmath12 is a class @xmath22 of @xmath1-dimensional @xmath3-module .",
    "first , we show a remarkable factorization property of the generating function of the poincar polynomials in theorem [ thm : t2 ] .",
    "it decomposes into the product of the contributions of _ cores _ and those of _",
    "quotients _ of young diagrams in @xmath23 : @xmath24 next , we compute each part separately",
    ". computations of the core part @xmath25 is purely combinatorial .",
    "on the other hand , we use geometry of hilbert scheme of points , to get the quotients part @xmath26 .",
    "then we obtain a closed formula for @xmath27 in theorem [ thm : t1 ] , where @xmath27 is expressed as a ratio of the riemann theta function and the dedekind eta function .",
    "this result is due to nakajima , as we mentioned earlier .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we devote  2 to combinatorial preliminaries .",
    "the most important notions in  2 are _ cores _ and _ quotients _ of young diagrams . in  3 ,",
    "we introduce quiver varieties and torus actions on them .",
