    "tropical geometry allows to express certain algebraic - geometric problems in terms of discrete geometric problems using _ correspondence theorems_. one general aim is to establish new tropical methods to study the original algebraic problem ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a prominent example is the work of mikhalkin @xcite who gave a tropical formula for the number of plane curves of given degree and genus passing through a given number of points ; see also @xcite for related theorems",
    ". providing methods to establish these correspondence statements is an important task of current research .",
    "another important objective in tropical geometry is to understand the combinatorial structure of the tropical varieties which can be regarded as polyhedral complexes in @xmath1-dimensional space .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a transversal intersection of tropical hypersurfaces given by polynomials @xmath6 in @xmath7 with newton polytopes @xmath8 .",
    "for the special case @xmath9 and all @xmath10 standard simplices , vigeland studied the number of vertices and unbounded edges as well as the genus of this intersection @xcite .",
    "his methods strongly rely on the special structure of the newton polytopes .",
    "the new contributions of the present paper can be stated as follows .",
    "firstly , we provide a uniform and systematic treatment of the whole @xmath3-vector ( i.e. , the vector of face numbers ) of the tropical transversal intersection .",
    "in particular , we show how to reduce these counts to well - established tropical intersection theorems . generalizing the results in @xcite",
    ", our approach also covers the general mixed case , where we start from polynomials @xmath6 with arbitrary newton polytopes @xmath11 .",
    "we obtain formulas expressing the number of faces ( theorems [ theorem : vertexcount ] and [ theorem : unbounded ] ) and the genus ( theorem [ theorem : genus ] ) in terms of mixed volumes .",
    "secondly , we establish a combinatorial connection from the tropical genus of a curve to the genus of a toric curve corresponding to the same newton polytopes . in @xcite",
    ", khovanskii gave a characterization of the genus of a toric variety in terms of integer points in minkowski sums of polytopes .",
    "we show that in the case of a curve this toric genus coincides with the tropical genus ( theorem [ the : comparegenus ] ) .",
    "more than this result itself , we think that the methods to establish it are of particular interest .",
    "khovanskii s formula applies integer points in minkowski sums of polytopes , whereas the mentioned formula for the tropical genus is given in terms of mixed volumes .",
    "for the special case @xmath12 the connection boils down to the classical theorem of pick relating the number of integer points in a polygon to its area .",
    "we develop a pick - type formula for the surface volume of a lattice complex in terms of integer points ( theorem [ the : pickonsurface ] ) to show that in the generalized _ unmixed _ case ( @xmath1 arbitrary , all @xmath10 coincide ) the connection reduces to certain @xmath1-dimensional generalizations of pick s theorem ( macdonald @xcite ) . to approach the general mixed case we have to develop new aspects of a mixed ehrhart theory ( theorem [ the : mixedehrhart ] ) based on mcmullen s results on valuations @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ se : preliminaries ] gives a short introduction to tropical geometry , mixed volumes and ehrhart theory . in section [ section : f - vector ] we study the number of bounded and unbounded faces in a tropical intersection .",
    "using these results we give in section [ section : latticepointsandgenus ] a formula for the genus of a tropical intersection curve and show that this tropical genus coincides with the toric genus that depends on the same newton polytopes .",
