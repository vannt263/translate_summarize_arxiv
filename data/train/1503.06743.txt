    "also , we have argued in the letter that spontaneous emission enters at higher order , hence it can not provide imaginary shifts @xmath145 to the real poles of eq.([sm3 ] ) either , in contrast to refs.@xcite .",

    "<S> the origin of the discrepancy is in the algebraic manipulation inherited by the authors of ref.@xcite from ref.@xcite . in the appendix b of ref.@xcite </S>",

    "<S> interestingly , this result equals the time - independent term of eq.([ff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this coincidence can only be accidental , since the above replacement and the subsequent prescription on the order of integration are neither connected to the time - dependent terms of eq.([poles ] ) which cause the actual discrepancy with respect to the result of refs.@xcite nor to the causal - adiabatic approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that while we have invoked the existence of finite lifetimes @xmath118 in order to impose physical constraints on the detuning @xmath17 and on the observation time @xmath13 , no explicit reference to these quantities appear in our expression for @xmath54 . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> , only the emission through the exchange of resonant photons between the two atoms has been implicitly accounted for in our calculation of @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> however , our calculation lacks the inclusion of the spontaneous emission of each atom into free space , whose rates are @xmath119 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the processes corresponding to the latter phenomenon are generally unimportant in comparison to those depicted in fig.[fig1 ] since their leading contribution to @xmath54 is of order @xmath120 @xmath121 see fig.[fig2 ] </S>",
    "<S> . they might only be relevant for the case that the lifetimes are of the order of the temporal frequency of the interaction , @xmath122 , but they can not affect in any case the oscillatory behaviour found here for the terms of order @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> this argument opposes to the reasons given in ref.@xcite to add imaginary shifts to the real poles at @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> we finalize by mentioning that berman has shown in a recent publication @xcite how to introuduce spontaneous emission in a consistent manner in an adiabatic approximation . assuming that atom @xmath3 is excited adiabatically with @xmath125 , he has obtained the correct time - independent result .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we have shown that the van der waals interaction between two dissimilar atoms , one of which is initially prepared in an excited state , presents generically oscillations both in time and in space . in quasi - resonant conditions </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is dominated at all distances by the exchange of doubly resonant photons between the two atoms . </S>",
    "<S> it is modulated in space by long - range oscillations of frequency @xmath82 , while short - range oscillations take place at frequency @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the time frequency is @xmath17 , which determines the rate at which the excitation is transferred to atom @xmath4 . in the retarded regime </S>",
    "<S> the interaction takes the form of eq.([ff ] ) . only for large integration times , @xmath71 , </S>",
    "<S> that expression reduces to a time - independent term which oscillates in space with frequency @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is also equivalent to the result of the causal - adiabatic approximations ( see appendix and ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it does not agree , however , with the result of stationary perturbation theory @xcite .     which incorporate in the calculation of @xmath54 the effect of photon emission into free space . </S>",
    "<S> in @xmath126 and @xmath127 the photon @xmath128 is emitted into free space from atom @xmath3 , whereas in @xmath129 it is emitted from atom @xmath4.,width=309,height=83 ]    we thank paul berman and marie - pascale gorza for fruitful discussions . financial support from anr-10-idex-0001 - 02-psl and anr-13-bs040003 - 02 is gratefully acknowledged . </S>"
