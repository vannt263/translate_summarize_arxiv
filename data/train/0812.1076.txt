    "in evolutionary dynamics , different types of individuals compete for survival in a population .",
    "a type means genotype , social behavior , cultural trait , and so on , depending on the context .",
    "a type that is fitter than others generally bears more offsprings .",
    "a major quantity representing how successfully a type spreads in evolutionary dynamics is the fixation probability @xcite . in a simple case",
    "in which there are only two types , the fixation probability of a type is the probability that a single individual of that mutant type introduced in a population of the other wild - type individuals eventually occupies the entire population .",
    "requirements for considering the fixation probability are that the evolutionary dynamics are stochastic and that the two unanimity states , that is , the one of the introduced type and the other of the wild type , are the only two absorbing states .",
    "the fixation probability of a type depends on the fitness of the type , connectivity of individuals , and the update rule of evolutionary dynamics @xcite .",
    "evolutionary dynamics , both ecological and social , pretty often occur on complex contact networks of individuals @xcite .",
    "some networks as well as the rule of reproduction and other factors amplify the selection pressure in the sense that a fitter type has a larger fixation probability and a less fit type has a smaller fixation probability compared to a reference case of the all - to - all connected population @xcite",
    ". other combinations of a network and an update rule may suppress evolutionary pressure , with the fixation probability relatively insensitive to the fitness of the mutant type . to quantify the extent to which a particular situation amplifies or suppresses the selection pressure is important for assessing the impact of a mutant type .",
    "studies of fixation probability on networks and structured populations have been restricted to two neutral types @xcite or undirected and unweighted networks @xcite , albeit a notable exception @xcite .",
    "regarding the directionality , undirected ( and unweighted ) networks may be natural for modeling social interaction such as games , where an adjacent pair of individuals , for example , is simultaneously involved in a single game to determine the fitness of each individual .",
    "however , reproduction events given the fitness of each individual may occur on directed or weighted networks . indeed",
    ", relevant contacts in many real networks have directionality because of , for example , heterogeneity in the size of habitat patches @xcite and geographical biases such as the wind direction @xcite and riverine streams @xcite in ecological networks .",
    "social networks based on glooming behavior of rhesus monkeys @xcite , email communication of humans @xcite also have directionality . in the present work ,",
    "we examine the evolutionary dynamics on different undirected and directed networks , namely , the complete graph , the undirected cycle , the directed cycle , the weighted undirected star , undirected and directed random graphs , and undirected and directed scale - free ( sf ) networks . motivated by previous studies",
    "@xcite , we examine the effects of several update rules on the selection pressure .",
    "we show that asymmetric connectivity generally turns down the selection pressure and that specific update rules suppress the selection pressure more than other rules .",

    "the structure of the population is described by a directed graph @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the set of directed edges , implying that @xmath3 if and only if there is a directed edge from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . each node @xmath4 ( @xmath6 )",
    "is occupied by an individual of one type .",
    "edges represent the likelihood with which the types are transferred from nodes to nodes in evolutionary dynamics .",

    "the dynamics last until the unanimity ( i.e. , fixation ) of @xmath7 or that of @xmath8 is reached .",
    "we do not assume mutation so that these two collective states are the only absorbing states .",
    "we are concerned with the fixation probability of type @xmath7 denoted by @xmath10 .",

    "the effect of the initial location of the mutant has been analyzed for undirected @xcite and directed @xcite networks .",

    "the fixation probability at neutrality , namely , @xmath23 , is equal to @xmath33 . a type with a larger fitness is more likely to fixate , that is , @xmath34 .",

    "the finding that the directionality of the network suppresses the selection pressure can be explained for ld on a simple network .",

    "even though we have formulated the evolutionary dynamics on unweighted networks , the extension to the case of weighted networks is straightforward ( also refer to the analysis of the weighted star in appendix  b ) . by enumerating the possible reproduction events per unit time ,",
    "we obtain @xmath141 where the first and the second arguments of @xmath142 are the types at @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively , and @xmath142 is the fixation probability starting from that network state . note that @xmath143 and @xmath144 . using eqs .   and",

    ", @xmath35 takes the minimum at @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the unweighted network ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) is the most amplifying when we vary @xmath65 .",
    "ld on this unweighted network ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) is equivalent to the moran process with @xmath146 . accordingly , weighted networks ( i.e. , @xmath147 ) are suppressors , and the suppression is stronger as @xmath65 deviates from unity .",
    "the applicability of the arguments above is beyond the two - node network .",
    "suppose that a network is divided into two modules with homogeneous intramodular connectivity and that intermodular connectivity is sparse and homogeneous , possibly with more edges from one module to the other than the converse .",
    "then the fixation probability of a mutant on a particular node will depend only on the module in which the initial mutant invades .",
    "in this case , we can approximate the network by the two - node weighted network , where the edge weights between the two aggregated nodes represent the gross connectivity between the two modules .",
    "motivated by the observation that many real ecological and social networks underlying reproduction in evolutionary dynamics are directed or weighted , we have investigated the fixation probability on networks with directed edges under five update rules . for undirected networks ,",
    "selection pressure relies on the network and the update rule , which reproduces the previous results @xcite .",
    "our main conclusions in the present paper are twofold .",
    "first , directionality of edges suppresses the selection pressure for all the network types and the update rules that we have dealt with .",
    "we have presented numerical evidence for different sizes of networks ( sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical results ] ) and simple analytical arguments ( sec .",
    "[ sec : two - node ld ] ) to support this claim .",
    "note that many ecological and social situations in which evolutionary dynamics take place can be modeled as directed or weighted networks rather than undirected and unweighted networks .",
    "spreads of a type from one habitat to another may be easier than in the other direction because of heterogeneity in habitats and other geographical factors ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] for references ) .",
    "accordingly , fixation in real contact networks may be less controlled by the values of fitness than in the corresponding undirected networks or well - mixed populations .",
    "second , the strength of the selection pressure depends on the update rule for various networks , no matter whether edges are directed or not ( secs .  [ sec : simple ] and [ sec : numerical results ] ) .",
    "this conclusion extends the previous findings @xcite . for bd - d , db - b , and db - d",
    ", no evolutionary amplifier has been found by our exhaustive numerical analysis for small @xmath0 ( sec .  [ sub : n=6 ] ) . moreover",
    ", db - b is strongly suppressing compared to the other update rules . in evolutionary game theory , db - b @xcite and its variants @xcite have commonly been used . in games ,",
    "the fitness of a type is not constant , as assumed in the present paper , but depends on neighbors types .",
    "therefore , the results obtained in this work are not immediately applicable to evolutionary games . however",
    ", these previous results on evolutionary games might considerably change under update rules less suppressing than db - b , as has been argued @xcite .",
    "we have treated directed but unweighted networks for the sake of clarity of the analysis .",
    "however , we believe that our conclusions for directed networks extend to the case of weighted networks . this is partly supported by the analysis of the two - node weighted network presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : two - node ld ] .",
    "in addition , if we quantize the edge weight and allow multiple directed edges between two nodes , a weighted network can be regarded as a directed unweighted network .    a unique point in our analysis",
    "is the use of very small networks with @xmath87 .",
    "small networks per se appear in many ecological contexts .",
    "for example , the number of relevant habitats may not be very large @xcite .",
    "in addition , small directed networks are likely to be structural and functional building blocks of large networks @xcite . according to the present analysis , the effect of the directionality of edges and that of the update rule are mostly consistent between small and large networks .",
    "we believe that the conclusions of the present paper apply to real evolutionary dynamics in populations of various scales .",

    "here , we explain the methods for exactly calculating the fixation probability for strongly connected networks .",
    "because each node takes either type @xmath7 or @xmath8 , there are @xmath85 possible states of the evolutionary dynamics .",
    "we define the fixation probability for a state , which may have multiple type-@xmath7 nodes , by the probability that type @xmath7 fixates starting from that state .",
    "the fixation probability for the all-@xmath7 state is 1 , and that for the all-@xmath8 state is 0 .    given a network , an update rule , and @xmath9 , the evolutionary dynamics are equivalent to a nearest - neighbor random walk on the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube comprising @xmath85 points . in each time step , the type at a node replaces the type at one of its neighbors in the original evolutionary dynamics .",

    "we can not solve the fixation probability for @xmath164 due to the computational cost of enumerating the directed networks , but not due to the cost of solving systems of @xmath86 linear equations .",
    "in this appendix , we show detailed calculations of the fixation probability for simple graphs . following a standard procedure , we map the evolutionary dynamics onto the discrete - time nearest - neighbor random walk on interval @xmath165 .",

    "<S> here we examine how the selection pressure is modulated by directionality of interactions under several update rules . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions are twofold . </S>",
