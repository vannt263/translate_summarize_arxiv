    "the exploration of the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) for the whole density - temperature plane is a challenging task for the standard model .",
    "lattice monte carlo simulations have revealed several exciting results over the past decade  @xcite . at finite densities ,",
    "modeling of qcd has added substantially to our understanding of its rich phase structure  @xcite . in the last years heavy - ion collision experiments focus on the investigation the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "early concepts of the qgp were guided by the assumption of a weakly interacting systems of partons because the entropy density @xmath2 and the energy density @xmath3 calculated from lattice qcd were close to the stefan boltzmann ( sb ) limit for a relativistic noninteracting system .",
    "however , recent observations at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) indicated that the qgp created in ultrarelativistic au + au collision was interacting more strongly than hadronic matter  @xcite . because of these experimental facts the noticeable deviation ( @xmath4 ) became more important .    in the hadronic phase of qcd the partition function of a hadron resonance - gas yields a satisfactory description of lattice results on bulk thermodynamic observables in the low temperature region for @xmath5  @xcite and in the general case at finite densities , i.e. @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "in this context the investigation of the interaction between the partons in the deconfined phase plays a crucial role to understand the properties of the qgp .",
    "the dynamical quasiparticle picture is one important way to relax the approximation of the qgp as an ideal gas  @xcite of massive but noninteracting degrees of freedom .",
    "alternatively , the phase structure can be investigated in the finite width model ( fwm ) by analizing its isobaric partition given by a generalization of statistical ensembles with fluctuating extensive quantities  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to use a generalized formalism to calculate the corrections to a single - particle partition function starting from an interaction potential .    in this work",
    "we use the latter formalism , which is a generalized version of the classical virial expansion , to calculate the partition function with an interaction potential extracted from lattice calculations . + the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : virial ] we introduce the virial expansion for vanishing quark chemical potential @xmath7 . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we motivate our model for the hadronic as well as for the deconfined phase and in section  [ sec : results ] we show the results of the virial expansion within our model .",
    "we extend in section  [ sec : mu ] the virial expansion to finite densities and again compare our results with lattice calculations .",
    "furthermore , we explicitly evaluate the confinement - deconfinement phase transition and the isobaric and isentropic lines .",
    "the conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] finalize this work .",
    "the main quantity to establish thermodynamical properties of qcd is the partition function @xmath9 . in this section",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of vanishing chemical potential @xmath7 , i.e. vanishing baryon number .",
    "the partition function then is obtained as @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath12 is the inverse temperature . for particles with spin - isospin degeneracy factor",
    "@xmath13 the logarithm of the partition function reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 for bosons and @xmath16 for fermions .    in the case of an interaction free system , the hamiltonian @xmath17 is given by the kinetic energy @xmath18 and therefore depends on @xmath19 only .",
    "for massless particles one has ( with @xmath20 ) @xmath21 and can calculate the partition function for bosons as well as for fermions , @xmath22 accordingly , the boson and the fermion partition functions are connected by @xmath23 for non - interacting particles with mass @xmath24 the hamiltonian is given by @xmath25 and the partition function can be expressed in terms of the bessel function @xmath26 .",
    "+ from the partition function all thermodynamic quantities can be derived : pressure , energy density , entropy , interaction measure and velocity of sound . using the free massless partition function this leads to the well - known stefan boltzmann limit .",
    "+ to relax the dependence on the size of the system we divide the partition function by the volume @xmath27 and all calculated quantities become densities . in general",
    "we are not able to calculate exactly the partition function except by numerical diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian . to incorporate the effect of interactions we start with the classical virial expansion .",
    "to this aim we consider the @xmath28-body hamiltonian defined by @xmath29 in classical physics the bose as well the fermi distributions in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lnz ] ) merge to the boltzmann distribution and the logarithm in the integrand drops .",
    "then , we can separate the kinetic and the interaction term in the partition function . to recover the quantum statistics we perform a minimal substitution by replacing the integral over the momentum by the integral for the free case , which leads to the exact stefan boltzmann limit .",
    "the definition @xmath30 where we suppressed for simplicity the indices for fermion and bosons , leads to an expansion of the partition function in powers of @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 we consider only the first two terms of this expansion : then the coefficients are given by @xmath33 the pressure reads @xmath34 and can be directly expressed in terms of the particle density @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain for the first terms of the expansion @xmath36 the other quantities can be calculated from the pressure or the partition function using the thermodynamic relations : @xmath37",
    "the application of the virial expansion formalism to investigate the properties of the hadronic and partonic matter requires the calculation of the single - particle partition function for the degrees of freedom and of the corrections given by the residual interaction between the constituents. for the confined phase the degrees of freedom are the hadrons while in the qgp phase they are the quarks / antiquarks as well as the gluons .",
    "the analysis of thermodynamic properties of the hadronic phase has demonstrated that a good description is achieved using a phenomenological resonance - gas model taking into account all mesonic and baryonic resonances with masses up to 1.8 gev and 2.0 gev , respectively .",
    "this amounts to 1026 resonances that truly are experimental parameters of the model  @xcite . in this case",
    "the residual interaction may be neglected .",
    "however , to reduce the number of the experimental parameters for the description of the low temperature region of qcd we explicitly write the partition function of the resonance - gas in the boltzmann limit as  @xcite @xmath38 where the sum begins with the stable ground state @xmath39 and includes the resonances @xmath40 with weights @xmath41 relative to @xmath39 . to specify",
    "@xmath41 we employ the hagedorn hypothesis  @xcite of an exponential growth of the number of hadronic resonances with mass .",
    "the formula for the asymptotic dependence of the density of hadronic states on mass @xmath24 is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes a slowly varying function and @xmath44 is the hagedorn temperature estimated to be in the range of @xmath45 mev .",
    "we choose the form @xmath46 defined for @xmath47 mev taking into account that the pions are the hadronic states with the lowest mass .",
    "we now replace the sum in the resonance - gas partition function ( [ eqn : z_hgs ] ) by an integral and insert the exponentially growing mass spectrum ( [ def : rho ] ) with the choice of @xmath43 ( [ form1 ] ) , @xmath48 in the limit of low temperatures , i.e. @xmath49 , the bessel function can be approximated by , @xmath50 and the integral in the resonance - gas partition function ( [ eqn : z_hgi ] ) can be solved analytically .",
    "this gives @xmath51 and leads to a good description of the thermodynamical variables .    to perform a realistic investigation of the properties of the qgp we have to determine a realistic effective interaction between the partons in the deconfined phase .",
    "the starting point for this aim is provided by lattice calculations for the quark - antiquark free - energy .",
    "there are many parametrizations of this quantity and several discussions about the role as effective potentials ( or alternatively as the internal energy )  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the parametrization of the free energy given by megias et al . in ref .",
    "this phenomenological model includes non - perturbative effects from dimension two gluon condensates .",
    "this one - gluon exchange model , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the description of the polyakov loop , allows for a good parametrization of the singlet heavy quark - antiquark free energy lattice data in gluon - dynamics .",
    "the connection between dimension two gluon condensates and qgp - properties has been confirmed by recent fits of the interaction measure in gluon - dynamics in terms of the condensate  @xcite .",
    "the expression for the free energy in this model is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the singlet free energy at infinite separation and @xmath54 is the effective potential for the deconfined phase .",

    "accordingly , we consider @xmath61 as a free parameter that we may fix in comparison with @xmath62 lattice calculations  @xcite for the pressure ( calculated for @xmath63 ) .",

    "<S> we describe recent three - flavor qcd lattice data for the pressure , speed of sound and interaction measure at nonzero temperature and vanishing chemical potential within a virial expansion . for the deconfined phase we use a phenomenological model which includes non - perturbative effects from dimension two gluon condensates that reproduce the free energy of quenched qcd very well . the hadronic phase is parameterized by a generalized resonance - gas model . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we extend this approach to finite quark densities introducing an explicit @xmath0-dependence of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate pressure , quark - number density , entropy and energy density and compare to results of lattice calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we , additionally , investigate the structure of the phase diagram by calculating the isobaric and isentropic lines as well as the critical endpoint in the ( @xmath1)-plane . </S>"
