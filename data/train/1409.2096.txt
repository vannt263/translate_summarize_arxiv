    "characterizing correlations between different subsystems of a composite quantum system has been an important field of research in quantum information  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that quantum correlations , in the form of entanglement , is shown to be significantly more useful for performing communication and computational tasks over their classical counterparts  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these tasks have successfully been realized in the laboratory in several physical systems and thereby attracted a lot of attention in the field of detection and quantification of quantum correlations  @xcite . on the other hand , several non - intuitive results like local indistinguishability of orthogonal product states , non - classical efficiencies of a computational task by states having negligible entanglement , etc .",
    "have also been discovered  @xcite , which highlights the needs for conceptualization of quantumness in a composite system that is different from entanglement .",
    "this led to the introduction of quantum correlations like quantum discord ( qd )  @xcite and quantum work deficit ( qwd )  @xcite that are independent of the entanglement paradigm .",
    "one of the difficulties encountered in realizations of quntum information protocols is that quantum correlations decohere rapidly by interaction with the environment @xcite .",
    "specifically , the intra - system quantum correlations decrease with time while the quantum correlations between the system and the environment increase . as a result",
    ", the system typically becomes less efficient in performing quantum information processing tasks .",
    "therefore , the decay of quantum correlations with time in an open quantum system is a cause for concern .",
    "consequently , knowledge of the behavior of quantum correlations in various quantum systems when subjected to different environments seems indispensable .",
    "recent studies show that for a specific class of states , entanglement undergoes a _ sudden death _",
    "@xcite at a finite time whereas qd decays asymptotically with time  @xcite .",
    "although a few studies have addressed the issue of preserving quantum correlation measures during their dynamics  @xcite , identifying the inherent property in quantum states , prohibiting the loss of quantum correlations over time , is still an open question . in the present work ,",
    "we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for freezing of quantum correlation measures , for both qd and qwd , when a two - qubit state _ with magnetization _ is subjected to local depolarizing channels , in which bit - flip ( bf ) , phase - flip ( pf ) , or bit - phase - flip ( bpf ) errors can occur .",
    "we show that inhomogeneity in magnetization plays a crucial role for the freezing behavior of the state .",
    "the necessary and sufficient criteria show that there exist regions in which qd freezes while qwd does not , highlighting the necessity of proper choice of the quantum correlation measure to demonstrate the freezing phenomenon , and also that if the efficient performance of a certain quantum information task requires the freezing of a particular quantum correlation measure , the same may not remain efficient in a situation or environment where another quantum correlation is frozen . for both qd and qwd",
    ", we propose a complementarity relation between the quantum correlation during the freezing interval and the duration of the interval .",
    "for the class of states for which freezing is observed , we find a correspondence between the entanglement of the initial state and its freezing properties .",
    "the study is extended to multipartite states where two prescriptions for generating multipartite freezing states are proposed .",
    "like decoherence - free subspaces @xcite , introduced to protect qubits , the generated inherently decoherence - free states can be a building block of quantum memory @xcite in which quantum correlation in the form of qd or qwd can be stored .",
    "undoubtedly , the bipartite as well as the multipartite states which show freezing are of immense theoretical and experimental importance in quantum information processing tasks as they are inherently decoherence - free states for a finite time interval .",
    "however , there exists a large class of states for which quantum correlations do not freeze , but the change in quantum correlations is very slow with time .",
    "hence it is interesting to quantify the freezing quality of a quantum correlation measure .",
    "we introduce a measure to quantify the goodness of freezing and call the measure as the freezing index .",
    "we then apply the measure to characterize the effective freezingof qd present in the anisotropic quantum @xmath0 model in a transverse field @xcite , which appears in the description of certain solid - state realizations @xcite , as well as in that of controlled laboratory settings  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the index is capable of detecting the quantum phase transition in the model .",
    "the corresponding finite size scaling analysis has also been carried out .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ qmeasures ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the measures of quantum correlations used in this study and describe the methodology for investigating their dynamics in the presence of local noise . in section  [ twoqubit ] , the necessary and sufficient conditions for freezing of quantum correlations for bipartite states are derived and a complementarity of the value of the frozen quantum correlation with the freezing interval is obtained .",
    "the possible correspondence of the entanglement properties of the initial states to their freezing behavior is also addressed . section  [ multiqubit ] deals with the generalization of the bipartite freezing behavior into multipartite cases .",
    "we discuss the phenomenon of effective freezing in section  [ efreez ] .",
    "there , we also quantify the quality of freezing by proposing a freezing index , and demonstrate its behavior in the case of the well - known transverse - field anisotropic @xmath0 model .",
    "section  [ conclude ] contains the concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we provide a brief description of the quantum correlation measures used in the paper , namely , the qd and the qwd . we also present the methodology for investigating the dynamics of quantum correlations , when quantum states are subjected to local noise , and discuss the freezing of quantum correlations .      in classical information theory , mutual information between two random variables @xmath1 and",

    "we denote the cc and the qd by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , and calculate qd by performing the measurement on @xmath1 .",
    "the optimization involved in the definition makes the analytical calculation of the qd , for an arbitrary bipartite state , a hard problem .",
    "however , for states with certain symmetries , such as the bell - diagonal ( bd ) states , the optimization is known exactly  @xcite .      the other information - theoretic quantum correlation measure that we consider is the qwd  @xcite .",
    "it is quantified as the difference between the amount of pure states extractable under suitably restricted global and local operations . for a bipartite state @xmath8",
    ", we consider the class of global operations , termed closed operations ( co ) , consisting of _",
    "( i ) _ unitary operations , and _",

    "we will consider the situation where each qubit of a multi - qubit system interacts with an independent reservoir via decoherence channels .",
    "following the kraus operator formalism , the density matrix of a system of @xmath45 qubits , @xmath46 , evolves with time as @xmath47 where @xmath48 describes the noisy channel acting on the qubit @xmath49 .",
    "the quantum channels describing the interaction of a qubit and its environment ( the reservoir ) can be of various types .",
    "we focus on three types of decoherence channels , namely , the bit - flip ( bf ) , the phase - flip ( pf ) , and the bit - phase - flip ( bpf ) channels .",
    "the kraus operators for these channels are given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 , are the pauli spin matrices and @xmath52 is the identity operator on the qubit hilbert space",
    ". here @xmath53 , for @xmath54 , and @xmath55 correspond to the bf , bpf and pf channels respectively . the decoherence probability , @xmath56 , called parametrized time , depends explicitly on time @xmath57 and is taken to be the same for all the qubits with @xmath58 .",
    "it is convenient to describe the dynamical evolution of systems under decoherence channels in terms of the decoherence probabilities , since such description takes into account a wide range of physical situations .",
    "a particularly important class of physical scenarios is the one for which the functional dependence of the decoherence probability on time , @xmath57 , describes the markovian approximation , where @xmath56 is often an increasing function , @xmath59 , of @xmath57 , such as @xmath60 , with @xmath61 being a decay rateof the function  @xcite .",
    "when a non - markovian environment is considered , @xmath56 may be an oscillatory function of time with a decaying amplitude .",
    "one should note that under markovian approximation , @xmath62 and is fixed for a given bunch of local environments , with the corresponding evolution being scanned by varying @xmath56 .",
    "once the time evolved density matrix , @xmath63 , is known , one can calculate its different quantum correlations as functions of system parameters and the decoherence probability , to investigate their dynamical behavior under various decoherence channels .      even as quantum correlations continue to be regarded as fragile quantities ,",
    "there are undespairing efforts to control such decay .",
    "an interesting possibility is the identification of shared quantum states that offer a stagnant or near - constant behavior of quantum correlations when affected by noisy time - dynamics . in case",
    "we find that a quantum correlation measure is a constant in time for a certain time interval , we say that it is exhibiting the phenomena of freezing .",

    "we refer to these states as the canonical initial states .",
    "next , we will show that to preserve quantum correlation from decohering , inhomogeneous magnetizations play an important role .",
    "the analysis is henceforth mainly carried out for the local bf channel . however , a straightforward generalization of the presented results is possible for other local quantum channels , in particular , the pf and the bpf channels .",
    "we begin by investigating the freezing dynamics of quantum correlations , as measured by the qd , using the canonical initial states . unlike the bell - diagonal ( bd )",
    "states @xcite , qd of the states evolved from ci states can not be computed analytically @xcite .",
    "however , numerical simulations show that for a large fraction of states  _ special _ ci ( sci ) states @xmath80  the optimization takes place for the projectors corresponding to three sets of regular values @xmath81 : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . the existence of the complementary class , which we denote by @xmath85 , makes the analytical calculation of the qd for @xmath8 difficult .",

    "in this article , we address an interesting and as yet not entirely understood aspect of the effects on the measures of quantum correlation belonging to the information theoretic paradigm under decoherence .",
    "specifically , we investigate the freezing of quantum correlations present in an open quantum system subjected to local noise .",
    "our analysis identifies conditions that must be satisfied by bipartite as well as multipartite quantum states for freezing of quantum correlations in a decohering dynamics .",
    "it turns out that inhomogeneity in the magnetization of the state plays a crucial role in the freezing behavior . by comparing freezing properties of qd and qwd ,",
    "we conclude that the identification of a proper measure of correlation is necessary for observation of freezing in a specific quantum state , which is clearly in contrast to earlier results .",
    "we propose a complementarity relation between the frozen value of the quantum correlation and the freezing terminal , which is the time at which the quantum correlation in the decohering state ceases to be frozen .",
    "we also demonstrate the fact that the set of states exhibiting the freezing behavior of quantum correlations is a non - convex set , containing entangled as well as separable states .",
    "we have pointed out that apart from the quantum states that exhibit exact freezing , there also exist many quantum states which exhibit extremely slow decay of quantum correlations , and can be appropriate for information theoretic applications .",
    "we introduce a freezing index  a quantifier of the figure of merit of the dynamics with respect to freezing , which can be useful in classifying quantum correlation measures and quantum states with respect to their goodness in freezing . applying the freezing index to the transverse - field @xmath0 model ,",
    "we show that the two phases of the ground state of the model have different freezing characteristics .",
    "the scaling of the freezing index with system - size is also investigated .",
    "we expect our approach to inspire novel ventures in understanding the intricacies of the dynamics of quantum correlations in open quantum systems .",
