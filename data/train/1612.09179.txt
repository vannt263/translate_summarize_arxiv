    "given a compact metric space @xmath0 , a map @xmath8 is said to be _ minimal _ if the forward orbit @xmath9 is dense in @xmath0 , for every @xmath10 .",
    "in such a case we call @xmath0 minimal with respect to @xmath11 , or simply minimal if there is no confusion as to the map . in the present paper",
    "we contribute to the following two well known problems .",
    "we shall refer to a space @xmath0 as minimal if it admits a minimal map .",
    "* is minimality with respect to homeomorphisms preserved under cartesian product in the class of compact spaces ? *",
    "what spaces admit minimal noninvertible maps ?      as with many other topological and dynamical properties , a fundamental question is to determine whether the property of being a minimal space is preserved under the cartesian product , and it seems quite surprising that it has not been settled until now .",
    "note that , for example for the fixed point property this question had been resolved in the negative already 50 years ago by lopez @xcite .",
    "in addition , basic examples of minimal spaces such as the circle , or the cantor set , are known to preserve minimality under the cartesian product , and there have not been even prospective candidates to provide a counterexample . although no product of a homeomorphism with itself @xmath12 is minimal , by the fact that it keeps the diagonal @xmath13 invariant , the cartesian product typically gives rise to new homeomorphisms that do not factor as conjugate homeomorphisms onto both coordinate spaces , and in this way minimal homeomorphisms of the product can often be obtained . in the present paper , however , we finally settle this problem in the negative , by providing a class of counterexamples .",
    "each space @xmath1 in the class is such that it admits a minimal homeomorphism but no cartesian power of it @xmath14 does .",
    "each such space also admits a monotone map onto a suspension of a minimal cantor system , and the minimal homeomorphisms it admits are extensions of minimal homeomorphisms of the suspension .      in the late 1960s auslander raised the question concerning the existence of minimal noninvertible maps . in a joint work with yorke",
    "he showed that the cantor set admits such maps @xcite . since then more examples have been given , but as in the case of minimal homeomorphisms and flows , the classification of spaces admitting such maps is a difficult well known open question . in 1979 auslander and katznelson showed that the circle admits no such maps @xcite , despite supporting minimal homeomorphisms . in 2001 kolyada , snoha and trofimchuk constructed such maps for the 2-torus , proving that any minimal skew product homeomorphism of the 2-torus @xmath15 having an asymptotic pair of points has an almost one - to - one factor which is a noninvertible minimal map of @xmath15 @xcite . modifying this approach , in 2003 bruin , kolyada and snoha proved in @xcite that any minimal skew product homeomorphism of @xmath15 having an asymptotic pair of points has a factor which is a noninvertible minimal map of a 2-dimensional nonhomogeneous metric continuum @xmath0 , such that any homeomorphism of @xmath0 has a fixed point .",
    "tywoniuk showed in @xcite that solenoids , unlike the circle , admit noninvertible minimal maps .",
    "it had been a long - standing open question if the circle is the only nondegenerate continuum that admits a minimal homeomorphism but no minimal noninvertible map .",
    "it is a well known unresolved conjecture that the pseudo - circle is another such continuum , motivated by the fact that it admits minimal homeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "recently downarowicz , snoha and tywoniuk @xcite have answered the general question in the negative by providing a family of counterexamples that belong to the class of so - called slovak spaces .",
    "these spaces have their homeomorphism groups generated by a minimal homeomorphism , which in some cases has positive entropy , but they all admit no minimal noninvertible maps . in the present paper",
    "we show a new , very general class of compact spaces that admit minimal noninvertible maps .",
    "namely , any compact , finite  dimensional metric space that admits a continuous , aperiodic minimal flow belongs to that class .",
    "in addition to some manifolds with zero euler characteristic , examples include peculiar minimal sets of flows on compact manifolds , such as the denjoy and kuperberg minimal sets .",
    "we shall start in section 2 with the construction of a new class of spaces admitting minimal noninvertible maps .",
    "the maps are obtained as perturbations of time @xmath16 homeomorphisms of aperiodic minimal continuous flows on metric spaces .",
    "our inverse limit approach is motivated by the method introduced by aarts & oversteegen , who in @xcite used it to construct a transitive homeomorphism of the sierpinski carpet . a novel variant of this method",
    "is then used in section 3 to modify minimal cantor systems suspensions to obtain minimal continua , none of which admits minimality in the cartesian product of finitely many copies of itself .",
    "these continua resemble some of the slovak spaces constructed by different methods by downarowicz , snoha and tywoniuk , where a dense orbit of a minimal homeomorphism was blown up to a null seqeunce of @xmath17-curves .",
    "our inverse limit approach allows us to introduce a null sequence of pseudo - arcs instead , which in the resulting spaces forces factorwise rigidity , as well as almost cyclicity of their homeomorphism groups , in the sense that they are isomorphic to either @xmath18 or @xmath19 . in the final section of the paper",
    "we illustrate how these techniques can be applied in a wider context to spaces that do not admit minimal flows but instead minimal maps that preserve a local product structure in a sufficiently smooth manner .",
    "in what follows , we identify the unit circle with @xmath20 and the 2-dimensional torus with @xmath21 .",
    "a continuous surjection @xmath22 is _ almost 1 - 1 _ if the set @xmath23 is dense in @xmath1 .",
    "a dynamical system @xmath24 is an _ almost 1 - 1 extension _ of @xmath25 if there exists an almost 1 - 1 factor @xmath26 .",
    "note that if @xmath24 is a minimal almost 1 - 1 extension of @xmath25 then @xmath27 is dense in @xmath0 .",
    "in fact both sets @xmath28 and @xmath27 are residual in that case .    in @xcite kolyada , snoha , and trofimchuk proved that any minimal skew product homeomorphism of the 2-torus having an asymptotic pair of points has an almost 1 - 1 factor which is a noninvertible minimal map . by an inverse limit technique of aarts and oversteegen",
    "@xcite , as well as the application of lemma 3.1 in @xcite , we prove the following related result .",
    "[ generalnonivert ] let @xmath3 be a continuous , aperiodic minimal flow on the compact , finite  dimensional metric space @xmath4 .",
    "then there is a generic choice of parameters @xmath5 , such that the homeomorphism @xmath6 admits a noninvertible minimal map @xmath7 as an almost 1 - 1 extension .    by standard techniques ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite , there exists a residual set @xmath29 of parameters @xmath16 such that the time@xmath16 map @xmath30 is minimal , and hence we may fix such a @xmath31 and denote @xmath32 by the theorem of bebutov and its consequences ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) there is for each @xmath33 and @xmath34 a local section @xmath35 with corresponding flow box neighbourhood @xmath36 and a homeomorphism onto its image @xmath37 that conjugates the time @xmath16-tmap @xmath38 of the flow restricted to @xmath36 with addition by @xmath16 in the first coordinate on the image .",

    "we now fix a particular @xmath53 and then construct for @xmath54 a nested sequence of local sections @xmath55",
    "( i.e. @xmath56 ) and corresponding flow box neighbourhoods @xmath57 , with corresponding homeomorphisms @xmath58 onto their images , constructed in such a way that @xmath59 when restricted to @xmath60 and @xmath61 for all @xmath62    for each @xmath63 denote @xmath64 .",

    "therefore a diagonal in the lattice of corners of the form @xmath302 must be mapped onto a diagonal of the same form , because squares of type @xmath282 may not `` cross '' squares of any other type .",
    "then there is an @xmath303 such that @xmath304 is a translation of diagonals , because if it translates one diagonal then , by the rigid structure of the diagonals and corner points , it must also translate all other diagonals in exactly the same way .",

    ", we have @xmath310 for some @xmath312 since @xmath274 is a continuum , minimality of @xmath301 implies that @xmath304 is minimal as well .",

    "note that since each @xmath313 is a homeomorphism , following the same lines of argument as above , @xmath313 must preserve the structure @xmath314 of the special composant @xmath247 .",

    "any factor of a minimal homeomorphism has to be minimal , proving that @xmath301 is not minimal .",
    "it is clear from the proof that the cartesian product of @xmath109 copies of @xmath1 , is not minimal for any @xmath117 .",
    "does there exist a minimal space @xmath1 , such that @xmath336 is minimal for some @xmath337 , but @xmath338 is not minimal for some @xmath339 ?",
    "while we have only applied our technique to spaces supporting a flow , in fact the technique only relies on having a map that preserves a local product structure along with the `` angular '' relation . in the case of flows ,",
    "this was accomplished by using the local translation structure , but this can also be achieved with certain classes of smooth maps . a large class of skew products provide examples of such maps as we illustrate below .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic interest of the extension of the construction , it allows us to produce an example of a minimal but noninvertible map of the klein bottle , which is known not to admit a minimal flow .",
    "this raises the possibility that the technique could lead to similar examples on a significantly larger class of manifolds than those that admit minimal flows .",

    ". then we can perform the `` blow up '' procedure as in theorem  [ generalnonivert ] applied to the entire orbit of @xmath355 , except for the compactification we use the circle of lines through the origin projected to an arc to compactify the pinched torus @xmath363 with an additional arc .",
    "this makes the corresponding map on the resulting inverse limit space ( which is still the torus ) continuous because the assignment of a line to the corresponding asymptote is continuous .    by the construction using inverse limits",

    "the proof is the same as in theorem  [ thm : skewt2 ] . simply , if we aim to `` blow up '' the point in @xmath379 then , since @xmath380 is a local homeomorphism , we can pull @xmath355 back to @xmath381 in @xmath15 and blow up the orbits of both @xmath41 and @xmath49 as in theorem  [ thm : skewt2 ] and then project this back to @xmath367 via the local homeomorphism @xmath382 we can then extend @xmath301 to the compactifying intervals using the same limits ( radial lines ) as for @xmath130 .",
    "the procedure described above works regardless of the special properties that @xmath130 might have . in @xcite parry presented a simple and elegant argument describing how to obtain a minimal homeomorphism of the klein bottle by defining a function @xmath342 satisfying @xmath383 and such that the skew product on @xmath15 given by @xmath373 is minimal .",
    "in fact , @xmath342 was defined by a convergent fourier series of a special type , allowing parry to obtain a family of minimal systems on @xmath367 in this way .",
    "motivated by this , sotola and trofimchuk showed by careful calculations in @xcite formulas to modify parry examples to non - minimal systems .",
    "they also mentioned ( see remark  2.9 in @xcite ) that their construction may lead to a minimal homeomorphism @xmath301 on @xmath367 with a continuum @xmath384 with @xmath385 which by results of @xcite may serve as an alternative proof .",
    "we see now that , based on the examples of parry , we can obtain similar examples in a direct way .",
    "recall that any almost 1 - 1 extension of a minimal homeomorphism is minimal .",
    "let @xmath373 be a minimal homeomorphism of @xmath15 constructed by parry , which induces a minimal homeomorphism @xmath301 on @xmath367 , with @xmath342 is differentiable and satisfying @xmath383 .",

    "clearly , when constructing inverse limit in theorem  [ thm : skewt3 ] we do not have to blow up forward orbit of @xmath355 , which allows us to construct noninvertible examples as described at the beginning of this section .",
