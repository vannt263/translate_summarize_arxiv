    "the first example of a non - trivial , integrable quantum many - body hamiltonian was found by calogero @xcite .",
    "it describes a system of n particles in one dimension interacting pairwise by means of an inverse square potential .",
    "the similar model endowed with an inverse sine - square potential is also integrable as shown by sutherland @xcite . in fact",
    "these two potentials are particular cases of a two parameter - family of potentials defined by the weierstass function @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of these models generalising the calogero - sutherland ( cs ) quantum models was reported in @xcite .",
    "their classical counterparts are discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "while integrable models ( classical or quantum ) can be studied because of their mathematical interest , it became apparent in recent years that the cs models can be applied to a large number of fields of physics .",
    "these range from condensed matter ( quantum hall liquids , quantum spin chains , .. ) @xcite to gauge theories @xcite , soliton theory @xcite as well as recently to questions related to black holes and ( anti)-desitter space @xcite .",
    "in particular it was shown in @xcite that the asymptotic dynamics of @xmath1-dimensional gravity in anti - desitter and desitter space respectively can be described by a generalised two - body cs model .",
    "the property of a model to be integrable ( i.e. to have a complete set of commuting constants of motion ) does not necessarily imply that the spectrum and the eigenfunctions of the corresponding hamiltonian can be constructed explicitely .",
    "the models which have this property are called _",
    "solvable_. from the beginning the cs models were known to be solvable , while further properties of their spectrum were obtained only recently , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , the explicit form of the spectrum is still missing as far as the full weierstrass - function potential is considered for generic values of @xmath0 .    a step forward in the construction of solvable n - body problems interacting via a weierstrass function was achieved in @xcite .",
    "the authors indeed showed that , when the weierstrass potential is supplemented by a suitable external potential , a finite number of eigenvectors can be computed explicitely in terms of special functions .",
    "stated differently , the model is quasi exactly solvable ( qes ) according to the definition of @xcite .",
    "in fact , the kind of interaction considered in @xcite and in the present paper generalises a potential first introduced in @xcite .    following the ideas of @xcite , the qes property holds when the hamiltonian operator posseses a finite - dimensional invariant vector space of functions .",
    "such a vector space was indeed constructed in @xcite for the hamiltonian considered .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this hamiltonian possesses alternative invariant finite - dimensional vector spaces of functions .",
    "the way these new vector spaces are constructed is very reminiscent to the multiple algebraisations of the lam equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which occur due to the properties of the jacobi elliptic functions .    the hamiltonian is presented in sect .",
    "ii . in this section",
    "we also give the transformation putting the hamiltonian in a lie - algebraic form which reveals its qes property .",
    "the new invariant vector spaces are constructed in sect .",
    "iii and the hamiltonian is studied for particular values of the parameters .",
    "the results are summarized in sect .",

    "the constants @xmath6 , @xmath7 are real and positive , @xmath8 is real .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath8 can be interpreted as the potential of an external field .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ oper ] ) was shown to admit an invariant , finite dimensional vector space of functions @xcite . restricting the operator to this vector space , the eigenvalue equation @xmath9",
    "is reduced to a matrix equation and , accordingly , a finite number of eigenvectors can be determined algebraically . following the definition of @xcite the operator @xmath10",
    "is called quasi exactly solvable ( qes ) .    to reveal this property @xmath10 has to be transformed appropriately .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite introduced the function ( called `` gauge factor '' ) @xmath11^a\\prod_k[{\\cal p}'(x_k+i\\beta)]^b\\ ] ] and the new variables @xmath12 then a hamiltonian @xmath13 -spectrally equivalent to @xmath10- is constructed according to @xmath14 .",

    "the potential @xmath28 in ( [ hbar ] ) is given by  : @xmath29 the crucial observation is that the hamiltonian @xmath30 can be written as a quadratic polynomial of the differential operators @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "these operators form a representation of the lie algebra @xmath33 for generic value of the real parameter @xmath34 , for @xmath32 they preserve the vector space @xmath35 and the representation is finite dimensional .    denoting by @xmath36 the part of @xmath13 which increases the degree of elements of @xmath35 , we find : @xmath37 obviously , the factor @xmath38 leads to the annihilation of all the monomials in @xmath35 which have overall degree @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we find : @xmath40 . as a consequence , eigenvectors of @xmath13 ( and therefore also of @xmath10 ) can be constructed in @xmath35 . in the following",
    "we will refer to this property as to an `` algebraisation '' of @xmath10 .",
    "inspired by the construction of the lam polynomials ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we introduce one further transformation of the hamiltonian @xmath10  : @xmath41 with the gauge factor @xmath42 of the form  : @xmath43    the choice @xmath44 obviously corresponds to @xcite . after a calculation , we find that for each value of the form @xmath45 the hamiltonian @xmath46 can be expressed as a quadratic combination of the operators ( [ lie ] ) with suitable values ( depending on the values of @xmath47 s ) of the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "we then found eight gauge factors ( [ factor ] ) leading to algebraisations of the initial operator @xmath10 .",
    "let us now investigate the relations between @xmath34 and the different parameters involved in the equations .",
    "we find that the degree - increasing part , say @xmath48 , of @xmath46 is given by : @xmath49 here , @xmath50 denotes the number of non - zero exponents @xmath47 , @xmath25 in ( [ factor ] ) , i.e. is either @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "note that for @xmath53 and @xmath54 three different algebraisations are available .",
    "if we allow @xmath39 to be a non - integer and require instead that @xmath55 with @xmath56 is an integer , we conclude that now @xmath57 in the special case @xmath58 , we can distinguish two different cases : 1 ) both @xmath39 and @xmath55 are integers and 2 ) only @xmath55 is an integer . for 1 )",
    "we find a quadruple algebraisation of the hamiltonian @xmath46 ( one algebraisation for @xmath59 and three for @xmath60 ) :    @xmath61    @xmath62    similarly , for 2 ) we find    @xmath63    @xmath64    now , @xmath65 should be an integer . again , this is a quadruple algebraisation of the hamiltonian @xmath46 ( one algebraisation for @xmath66 and three for @xmath53 ) .      in order to understand the pattern of the algebraic solutions obtained for the model ( [ oper ] ) , ( [ potential ] ) , it is useful to study the limit @xmath67 . using the relation",
    "@xmath68 it is easy to see that for @xmath67 the operator ( [ oper ] ) takes the form @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "the operator inside the brackets @xmath71 of ( [ lame ] ) constitutes @xmath0 decoupled copies of the lam operator @xmath72 : @xmath73 which admits ( @xmath74 ) algebraic eigenvalues if @xmath39 is an integer or a half integer .",
    "if @xmath39 is an integer ( @xmath75 ) eigenvectors of @xmath72 are of the form @xmath76 and ( @xmath77 ) eigenvectors are of the form @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "sn , cn , dn are abbreviations for the jacobi elliptic functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 denotes a polynomial of degree @xmath83 in its argument . if @xmath39 is a half integer @xmath84 eigenvectors of @xmath72 are of the form @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and ( @xmath88 ) eigenvectors are of the form @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , a total number of @xmath90 algebraic eigenvectors of the hamiltonian ( [ lame ] ) can be constructed . however , not all of them are completely symmetric under the permutations of the coordinates .",
    "since the procedure of algebraisation is crucially related to the symmetrized variables @xmath91 ( see ( [ tau ] ) ) , only the completely symmetric solutions can be hoped to be recovered in the generic case for which @xmath92 and/or @xmath93 .",
    "studying the solutions of the operator ( [ lame ] ) and the structure of the eigenfunctions of the lam operator , it is not difficult to see that the number of completely symmetric solutions is given by  :    @xmath94    if @xmath39 is an integer and @xmath95    if @xmath39 is a half integer , respectively .",
    "@xmath96 denotes the usual combinatoric symbol .",
    "we find that for @xmath58 the number of algebraic solutions available by applying the method described here agrees nicely with these above numbers .",
    "moreover , we checked for several particular cases that , indeed , the relevant lam solutions are reproduced in the limit @xmath97 .",
    "note that in @xcite only @xmath98 solutions were found for integer values of @xmath39 .",
    "our supplementary factorisations therefore complete the pattern .      for the choice @xmath99 , ( [ a1 ] ) leads to a @xmath100 matrix with respect to the basis @xmath101 @xcite : @xmath102 for ( [ a2 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath52 different @xmath103 matrices with respect to the basis @xmath104  : @xmath105 we thus obtain fifteen algebraic solutions , i.e. an additional nine to the ones obtained in @xcite . in figs .",
    "1a and 1b we show the energy eigenvalues as functions of @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "1a corresponds to two decoupled lam operators .",
    "the limit @xmath110 further corresponds to the completely integrable case of two decoupled oscillators ( @xmath111 , so @xmath112 and the potential vanishes in ( [ weier ] ) , ( [ lame ] ) ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of this system are of the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 are integers .",
    "the set of algebraic eigenvalues obtained with our factorisation ( [ factor ] ) represents just the completely symmetric case , i.e. @xmath115 , @xmath116 in this limit .",
    "this can be checked in fig .",
    "1a . in fig .",
    "1b the effect of an interaction potential on the energy eigenvalues is demonstrated for @xmath109 .",
    "the case for which two of the numbers @xmath117 are equal is in itself special , since the fifteen eigenvalues can be expressed as linear functions of @xmath6 and the system is highly degenerated , irrespectively of @xmath6 .",
    "e.g. for @xmath118 , @xmath119    three eigenvalues of the @xmath100 matrix are not degenerate  : @xmath120 the other three eigenvalues of the @xmath100 matrix coincide with those of the @xmath103 matrix @xmath121  : @xmath122 and finally the eigenvalues of the @xmath103 matrices @xmath123 and @xmath124 coincide and read  : @xmath125    this is clearly shown in fig.s  1a and 1b , where at @xmath110 three of the dotted curves , which correspond to three of the eigenvalues of the @xmath100 matrix , and the three dashed curves , which correspond to the three eigenvalues of @xmath121 , cross both for @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the three solid lines and the three dotted - dashed lines , which correspond to the three eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively , cross at @xmath110 . how these degeneracies disappear for a generic choice of @xmath24 , @xmath25",
    "is also shown in these figures finally , in fig .",
    "2 we demonstrate the dependence of the eigenvalues on the parameter @xmath6 for the special choice @xmath126 .",
    "the construction of integrable models of calogero - sutherland ( cs ) type has recently received a lot of attention in relation to new applications related to different domains of theoretical physics .",
    "the class of n - body integrable models remains however very tiny and several generalisations are worth considering .",
    "the construction of quasi exactly solvable hamiltonians describing n degrees of freedom appears to be a possible extension of the notion of integrable systems .",
    "as seen in @xcite the potential can be more general than those related to the root system of a lie algebra ( typically of the type @xmath127 for potentials depending on the differences of the particles coordinates ) .    in this paper",
    ", we reconsidered such a qes model proposed recently in @xcite .",
    "it depends on four parameters : two coupling constant @xmath128 and the two periods of the weierstrass function @xmath129 , parametrized by @xmath5 .",
    "more popular models are recovered for special limits of these constants : an inozemtsev model for @xmath58 , a system of n decoupled lam equations if @xmath67 and a system of n decoupled oscillators if , in addition , @xmath130 ( or equivalently @xmath131 ) .",
    "we have seen that the case @xmath58 possesses a particularly rich algebraic spectrum .    by investigation of the spectrum available in these limits",
    ", it appears that the solutions constructed in @xcite do not constitute the full set of completely symmetric algebraic eigenfunctions of the initial hamiltonian ( [ oper ] ) .",
    "following closely the construction of the lam polynomials we have found additional algebraisations of the operator @xmath10 .",
    "the set of algebraic eigenfunctions obtained in this way coincides exactly with the number of possible algebraic functions .",
    "we assume that an extension of the type of hamiltonian considered here to @xmath132 matrix valued operators @xcite might be possible , but leave this construction as a future project @xcite .",
