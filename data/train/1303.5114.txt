    "the theory of surface waves in homogeneous anisotropic elastic half - spaces has enjoyed remarkable progress in the 1960 s and 1970 s .",
    "the general framework developed by stroh @xcite for solving static and dynamic elasticity problems has proved to be very fruitful for study of surface waves . in a series of classic papers , e.g.  @xcite , barnett and lothe employed the framework of stroh to develop an elegant integral matrix formalism that underpins existence and uniqueness considerations for surface waves and that allows one to determine the surface wave speed without having to solve for any partial wave solutions .",
    "the barnett - lothe integral formalism was quickly realized to serve as a corner stone for the surface wave theory . on this basis",
    ", @xcite provided a thorough exposition of the complete theory for surface waves in anisotropic elastic solids , summarizing the major developments up to that time , 1977 .",
    "later on , a significant contribution came from alshits . with his co - workers ,",
    "he has done much work on extending the formalism of stroh , barnett and lothe to various problems of crystal acoustics , see the bibliography in this special issue . a full historical record and a broad overview of the surface wave related phenomena",
    "may be found in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is both to present a fresh perspective on the integral formalism for surface waves and also to provide new results , including a generalization to laterally periodic half - spaces .",
    "the central theme is the use of the matrix sign function which allows a quick derivation and a clear interpretation of the integral formalism of @xcite .",
    "the application of the matrix sign function in the context of the stroh formulation of elastodynamics was apparently first noted by @xcite in the course of calculation of impedance functions for a solid cylinder . we reconsider the classical surface wave problem in terms of the matrix sign function , showing in the process that it provides a natural solution procedure .",
    "for instance , it is known that the surface impedance matrix @xmath1 satisfies an algebraic riccati equation @xcite , but it has not been used to directly solve for @xmath2 . here",
    "we give the first explicit solution of this riccati equation for the impedance .",
    "another important attribute of the matrix sign function is that it allows the barnett - lothe formalism to be readily generalized to finding the surface wave speed in a periodically inhomogeneous half - space whose material properties are independent of depth ( i.e. a 2d laterally periodic half - space ) . for this case ,",
    "the present results provide a procedure that circumvents the need for partial wave solutions .",
    "instead it establishes the dispersion equation in terms of the matrix sign function which can be evaluated by one of the optional methods , in particular in the integral form similar to the barnett - lothe representation of the homogeneous case .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the surface wave problem is defined in  [ sec_2 ] in terms of the stroh matrix @xmath3 .",
    "the matrix sign function @xmath4 is introduced and discussed in ",
    "sec_3 where it is shown to supply a novel and possibly advantageous route to the barnett - lothe integral formalism .",
    "an explicit solution of the algebraic riccati equation for the surface impedance matrix @xmath2 is derived in  [ sec_4 ] .",
    "application of the matrix sign function to formulating and solving the surface wave dispersion equation in a laterally periodic half - space is considered in  [ sec_5 ] , with the numerical examples given for a bimaterial configuration .",
    "the appendix highlights explicit links between the sign function and some related matrix functions .",
    "the equations of equilibrium for time harmonic motion ( with the common factor @xmath5 everywhere omitted but understood ) are @xmath6where @xmath7 is mass density , @xmath8 are the elements of the elastic tensor @xmath9 referred to an orthonormal coordinate system , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are elements of the displacement @xmath12 and stress @xmath13 .",
    "we first consider a uniform elastic half - space @xmath14 , ( @xmath15 parallel to the free surface ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) : @xmath18 the equations of equilibrium take the form of a differential equation for the 6-vector @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20where @xmath21 , the 3@xmath223 matrix @xmath23 has components @xmath24 for arbitrary vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the identity matrix .",
    "the real - valued stroh matrix @xmath3 satisfies @xmath28 where @xmath29 indicates transpose and @xmath30 in block matrix form comprises zero blocks on the diagonal and identity blocks off the diagonal .",
    "denote the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath31 by @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and introduce the matrix @xmath35 with columns @xmath36 assume in the following the normal situation where all @xmath37 are distinct .",
    "then the above symmetry of @xmath3 yields the orthogonality / completeness relations in the form barnett73 @xmath38where the normalization @xmath39 has been adopted .",
    "hereafter we use the same notation @xmath27 for the identity matrix regardless of its algebraic dimension . throughout this paper",
    "we restrict our interest to the subsonic surface waves and thus assume that @xmath40 is less than the so - called limiting wave speed @xmath41 , see @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath42 are all nonzero and in pairs of complex conjugates ( denoted below by @xmath43 ) , so the set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath31 can be split into a pair of triplets as @xmath44these two triplets are commonly referred to as physical @xmath45 and nonphysical @xmath46 since they define partial modes that , respectively , decay or grow with increasing @xmath47 .",
    "the eigenvector matrix @xmath48 partitioned according to is written in the block form as @xmath49where the blocks @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 describe the physical and nonphysical ( decaying and growing ) wave solutions , respectively . from @xmath54 and so the orthogonality / completeness relations may be cast in the subsonic domain to the form @xmath55where @xmath56 denotes the hermitian transpose .",
    "note that the relations admit interpretation in terms of the energy flux into the depth .",
    "the surface wave solution comprises the decaying solutions only and therefore must have the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is some fixed vector .",
    "the surface wave problem for the homogeneous medium is posed as finding for a given wavenumber @xmath59 the surface wave speed @xmath60 for which the surface traction @xmath61 vanishes , and hence @xmath58 is a null vector of @xmath51 ( although this is not a fruitful avenue to follow , which is the whole point of the barnett - lothe solution procedure based on the integral representation ) .    a variety of related notations have been used for the surface wave problem .",
    "we generally follow @xcite where the notation is based upon that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite also provide comparisons of their notation with that used by @xcite , which is closer to that of @xcite .",
    "the slight notational differences are related to the choice of the @xmath62vector in , and amounts to different signs for the diagonal or off - diagonal elements of the @xmath63 matrix analogous to @xmath3 .",
    "the sign function of a matrix @xmath64 is conveniently defined by analogy with the scalar definition as @xcite @xmath65where the principle branch of the square root function with branch cut on the negative real axis is understood ; @xmath66 with @xmath67 if @xmath68 . as a result , the sign function of a matrix @xmath64 with eigenvalues and eigenvectors denoted by @xmath32 and @xmath69 satisfies @xmath70note that @xmath71 is unchanged under @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and it is undefined for eigenvalues lying on the imaginary axis ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we also note for later use the property @xmath75 .",
    "evaluation of the matrix sign function is possible with a variety of numerical methods @xcite , the simplest being newton iteration of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , with @xmath78 in the limit as @xmath79 , although this can display convergence problems .",
    "schur decomposition , which does not require matrix inversion , is very stable , and is readily available , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath71 also has integral representations , which we will use in order to shed fresh light on the integral formalism in the surface wave theory .",
    "see kenney:1995:msf , higham:2008:fm for reviews of the matrix sign function .",
    "the following expression for the matrix sign function is based on combined with an integral representation for the matrix square root function @xcite @xmath80equation may be converted into the following form using a change of integration variable @xmath81where @xmath82denotes the average .",
    "differentiation of @xmath83 yields @xmath84which implies @xmath85 for any @xmath86 .",

    ".    general significance of @xmath4 for surface waves is immediate when one considers the boundary condition which demands that a non - zero surface displacement exerts zero surface traction .",

    "another particularity is that the equality @xmath289 may signify occurrence of either a physical ( if @xmath290 ) or a nonphysical ( if @xmath291 ) surface wave solution . at the same time , the condition @xmath292 is both necessary and sufficient for the physical wave in , specifically , the subsonic domain , where @xmath293 and @xmath294 @xmath277 are invertible ( and so @xmath279 exists ) as can be argued similarly as in  3.3 . interestingly , this is no longer so in the upper overlapping band gaps of the floquet spectrum , where the condition is recast in the form with a positive definite matrix @xmath295which provides a single dispersion equation@xmath296note that those considerations above which used spectral decomposition under the assumption of distinct eigenvalues can be reproduced in the invariant terms of the projector matrix , see @xcite .",
    "significant simplification follows for the case of a symmetric unit cell where the fourier expansion @xmath90 reduces to a cosine expansion with real valued coefficients . in consequence",
    "the matrix @xmath297 is real and hence the basic conclusions obtained above for the case of a uniform half - space can be extended to the present case in hand . in particular by analogy with eq .",
    "( [ 36 ] ) it follows that the dispersion equation on the subsonic surface wave speed @xmath124 can be taken in any of the following equivalent real - valued forms @xmath298where @xmath299 is the adjugate matrix .",
    "note that the double zero of @xmath123  at @xmath124 makes the two other forms of the dispersion equation more appealing for numerical evaluation of @xmath287 .",
    "numerical results are presented for a laterally periodic half - space composed of layers of two alternating materials .",
    "interfaces between the layers are normal to the surface of the half - space .",
    "note that a periodically bilayered structure infinite along the periodicity axis can be seen as a periodically tri - layered with a symmetric unit cell and hence with a real matrix @xmath300 see  5.2.1 .",
    "we assume bimaterial structures of equidistant layers of any two of the three isotropic solids : copper ( cu , young s modulus @xmath301 = 115 gpa , poisson s ratio @xmath302 = 0.355 , @xmath7 = 8920 kg / m@xmath303 ) , aluminum ( al , 69 gpa , 0.334 , 2700",

    "the surface wave propagation direction @xmath304 that is the direction of the wavenumber vector @xmath305 ( see ( [ = 5 ] ) ) , is measured by the angle @xmath306 between @xmath307 and the plane of interlayer interfaces , so that @xmath308 corresponds to @xmath309 in the layering direction , i.e. , normal to the interfaces .",
    "the values of wavenumber @xmath310 considered are restricted to the first brillouin zone defined by the cell length in the layering direction , which is taken as unity .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] demonstrates the computed surface wave speed @xmath287 as a function of wave number @xmath310 for seven distinct directions of @xmath309 .",
    "the curves displayed are azimuthal cross - sections of the subsonic dispersion surface @xmath311 .",

    "use of the matrix sign function provides a new and broader perspective of the surface wave problem in anisotropic media .",
    "it straightens out the methodology of the underlying matrix formalism and offers a direct method to compute the matrices involved . starting from the defining property of the matrix sign function we have obtained known relations for the barnett - lothe matrices , the impedance matrix and the dispersion equation for the surface wave speed , see eqs .  , and .",
    "these expressions are achieved using only the sign function of @xmath0 times the stroh matrix @xmath314 without specifying its method of evaluation .",
    "an integral representation for the matrix sign function , combined with the explicit structure of the stroh matrix , leads immediately to the barnett - lothe integral relations . in this paper",
    "we have concentrated on using the matrix sign function for direct formulation of the dispersion equation , without discussing further properties of the barnett - lothe matrices which underlie the existence and uniqueness considerations in the surface wave theory barnett73,lothe76,chadwick77 .",
    "we have constructed an explicit solution of the matrix riccati equation for the impedance @xmath2 by rewriting the riccati equation in a form that involves the matrix sign function . apart from providing for the first time a direct solution of the riccati equation ,",
    "the use of the matrix sign function shows how this nonlinear equation is intimately related with the stroh matrix .",
    "perhaps the greatest advantage gained by using the matrix sign function is that it provides a natural formalism for framing the problem of subsonic surface waves in laterally periodic half - spaces which are inhomogeneous along the surface and uniform in the depth direction .",
    "we have shown how much of the structure for the homogeneous case carries over to the case of laterally periodic materials .",
    "for instance , the conditions for surface waves and the form of the block matrices in the matrix sign function mirror their counterparts for the homogeneous case , eqs .   and , respectively . naturally , there are major differences between the problems",
    ". conditions for the existence of surface waves in periodically inhomogeneous materials have only been recently established @xcite but the methods that have been proposed for finding them are not as straightforward as for the homogeneous case .",
    "the approach that we have presented for the laterally periodic case , being linked via the matrix sign function to the well known formalism for the homogeneous half - space , offers , we believe , a clear and logical route for finding surface waves .",
    "future work will examine this calculation method and the properties of the subsonic waves in more detail and will also consider supersonic solutions in the upper stopbands and passbands - the extension motivated by the classical paper by alshits and lothe @xcite .",
    "the matrix sign function of @xmath64 is closely related to other standard matrix functions .",
    "the matrix _ projector _ functions @xmath315 and @xmath316 are defined @xmath317 and therefore @xmath318 the projector functions can be expressed via integration , e.g.  @xcite @xmath319 where @xmath320 counter - clockwise encloses the finite right(left)-half plane @xmath321 , @xmath322 arbitrarily large .",
    "the schwartz - christoffel transformation @xmath323 reduces this to an integral around the unit circle @xmath324 while @xmath325 are singular if @xmath326 possesses eigenvalues @xmath327 , we note that is unchanged for @xmath328 , @xmath329 , @xmath330 , and is invariant for @xmath331 , @xmath332 , @xmath333 , and hence can always be made regular by selecting @xmath334 in the right half - plane .",
