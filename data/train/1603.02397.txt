    "in the generally believed cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm of the universe , galaxies grow in a `` bottom - up '' fashion as led by the cdm halos , with smaller ones forming first and then merging into successively larger ones .",
    "mergers and strong interactions of gas - rich galaxies are also believed to play a vital role in triggering the accretion activity , namely the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) phenomenon , of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) which reside at the centers of most ( if not all ) galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath20 ) in the local universe that were discovered three decades ago are found mostly in mergers , which inspired a merger - driven , evolutionary sequence from ulirgs to quasars and finally to present - day elliptical galaxies . at first",
    ", galaxy merging induces enormous starbursts , which are almost completely enshrouded by dust ( i.e. , in the ulirg phase ) , and triggers the central agn ; with the increasing feedback from the starbursts and agn , the cold gas and dust are heated up and even expelled out of the galaxy and thus the agn becomes optically bright ( i.e. , the quasar phase ) ; meanwhile the large - scale starbursts decline .",
    "finally the cold gas and dust is gone , the agn shuts down , and the galaxy becomes an old elliptical .",
    "this scenario has been supported by subsequent observations and @xmath21-body / sph simulations @xcite .",
    "particularly , the tight correlation between the masses of smbhs and the properties of the spheroids observed in local quiescent galaxies suggests a co - evolution of galaxies with smbhs ( see for a review ) .    in practice , however , the concrete triggering and feedback processes underlying this scenario have remained unknown for the last decades .",
    "this leaves many open questions , e.g. , what the timing is between starburst and agn activities , how the agn feedback operates in the host galaxy .",
    "the physical processes actually can not be learned from the statistical studies alone ( e.g. , correlation analysis ) of galaxy and quasar samples ; they are also beyond the capabilities of current simulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a straightforward way is to carry out complementary investigations of individual sources in detail , particularly of the rare cases in transitional phases of the proposed evolutionary sequence .",
    "this paper presents a detailed multiwavelength analysis of sdss  j163459.82@xmath0204936.0 ( hereafter j1634@xmath02049 ) , a type-1 agn at @xmath22 with outflows revealed in both broad absorption lines ( bals ) and narrow emission lines .",

    "the spectroscopy observation on the nearby galaxy demonstrates that j1634@xmath02049  was collided through by a galaxy , leaving a stellar ring around it on scales of 30  kpc (  [ subsec : ring ] ) . besides the outflow revealed in bals of hei *  and nai  d([subsec : measureabs ] ) , there are outflows revealed in the emission of the narrow hydrogen balmer and paschen lines , [ oii ] , [ oiii]@xmath28 , hei@xmath29 and @xmath30 (  [ subsec : emissionline ] )",

    "it is obvious that the observed sed of j1634@xmath02049  shows a very different shape from that of the average qso spectrum . in the uv , optical , and nir @xmath53 and @xmath54 bands ,",
    "j1634@xmath02049  is much lower than the average qso spectrum ; from the @xmath55 band up to the mir ( 530  @xmath50 ) , the shape of the sed is similar to that of the average qso spectrum ; in the fir band , j1634@xmath02049  shows an obvious excess , 10 times higher than the luminosity of the average sed of qsos at @xmath56 .    note that in figure  1 the @xmath57 photometric flux densities are systematically lower than the @xmath58 ones , which is actually because the @xmath57 data at 65  and 140   are not reliable . for the akari data , the quality flags at 65 , 90  and 140  are `` 1 '' , `` 3 '' and `` 1 '' , respectively , where `` 3 '' indicates the highest data quality and `` 1 '' indicates that the source is not confirmed . for the @xmath58 data , the quality flags of the flux densities at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100  are `` 1 '' , `` 3 '' , `` 3 '' and `` 2 '' , respectively , where `` 3 '' means the highest data quality and `` 1 '' means that the flux is only an upper limit .",

    "the @xmath58 12  flux density is higher than the @xmath60 @xmath61 ( 12 ) , which is because the @xmath58 12  datum is just an upper limit ( with a @xmath58 quality flag of `` 1 '' ) . besides",

    "we try to match its sed to the reddened versions of the average qso spectrum with different extinction curves . in figure",

    "spectra show little difference in the optical and nir bands .",
    "considering also the nuv and fuv photometric data retrieved from the galex archive ( albeit not as superior as a uv spectrum ) , the lmc extinction curve is favored ( see figure  [ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we will employ the lmc extinction curve with @xmath69 for the internal dust obscuration of j1634@xmath02049 .",
    "the ir luminosity ( 8 - 1000 @xmath50 ) is calculated based on the @xmath58 photometric fluxes following .",
    "because the @xmath58 12  flux density is an upper limit , in the calculation we use the @xmath60 datum in the @xmath61 band ( 12 ) instead .",
    "it gives log@xmath70 , which is very closed to the defining ir luminosity of ulirgs .",
    "as @xcite suggested , for typical qsos ( e.g. , pg  qsos ) , most of the far - infrared luminosity is originated from star formation .",
    "if this is the case for j1634@xmath02049 , following the relation sfr@xmath71 ( @xmath18 ) , the star formation rate ( sfr ) is estimated to be sfr @xmath72  yr@xmath27 .",

    "mrk  231 appears more reddened in the nuv  optical continuum . more strikingly , mrk  231 has a much larger excess in mir and fir bands with a deeper silicate absorption dip at 9.7@xmath83 m than j1634@xmath02049 .",
    "j1634@xmath02049  was photometrically observed by sdss in the @xmath84 , and @xmath23 bands on 2003 june 23 ut , with an exposure time of 54  s per filter in drift - scan mode @xcite .",
    "a bright point - like source appears at the center of its images and the whole galaxy is almost round in shape and has no spiral arms , indicating an elliptical / spheroidal or a face - on s0 galaxy .",
    "closer inspection reveals a low surface brightness ( sb ) yet visible , circumgalactic ring - like structure .",
    "although the standard sdss images have a relatively short exposure time and low spatial resolution due to the seeing limit , they are still very useful for global study .",
    "the drift - scan mode , yielding accurate flat - fielding , in combination with the large field of view ( fov ) ensures very good measurement of the sky background , and thus the azimuthally averaged , radial sb profile can be reliably determined down to @xmath85 mag  arcsec@xmath86 .",
    "we try to perform a two - dimensional ( 2d ) decomposition of the agn and host galaxy of j1634@xmath02049  using galfit @xcite .",
    "an accurate decomposition can not only help us understand its host galaxy , but also put an independent constraint on the sed of the agn , which is helpful for spectral fitting ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "taking advantage of the large fov , a bright yet unsaturated nearby star ( sdssj163503.44@xmath0204700.3 ) is selected as the psf image , whose precision is essentially important to separate the agn from the host .",
    "the host galaxy is represented by a @xcite @xmath87 function . during the fitting ,",
    "the sky background is set to be free ; the outer ring region , enclosed by the green polygon as in figure  [ fig:2dimage ] , is masked out .",
    "all other photometric objects in the field identified either by sextractor or by the sdss photometric pipeline are also masked out .",
    "we begin the fitting with a free psf  @xmath0  srsic  scheme allowing all parameters to vary , which yields an unreasonable high value of srsic  index ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "then we thus try to fixed @xmath89 to 4 , 3 , 2 , and 1 , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . except for the @xmath90-band image , which is totally dominated by the agn component , all other four bands yield well consistent results : the best - fit srsic",
    "component is with @xmath91 .",
    "we have also attempted to add an exponential disk component , yet no convergent result can be achieved .",
    "the fitting results in the @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 bands are summarized in figure  [ fig:2dimage ] and table  [ tab : galfit ] . to illustrate",
    "the agn and host galaxy contribution at different radii , shown in figure  [ fig:1dmodel ] shows the corresponding radial sb profiles of the best - fit components of the @xmath93 band image .",
    "as we know , the sdss spectrum is extracted through a fiber aperture of 3  in diameter . to further assess the agn and host galaxy fluxes in the fiber aperture , we have also integrated the fluxes within the aperture from the model images of the agn and srsic  components , respectively , which are also listed in table  [ tab : galfit ] .",
    "before we perform the analysis on its spectra from different telescopes / instruments , we first check the aperture effect because j1634@xmath02049  is an extended galaxy . although the sdss , dbsp , and nir spectra are observed with different apertures / slits , we find that the three spectra , which were calibrated independently , are well consistent in flux level ; especially , dbsp , and sdss spectra are almost the same in their overlap part .",
    "on the other hand , as figure [ fig:1dmodel ] demonstrates , the surface brightness of j1634@xmath02049  decreases rapidly in @xmath951 , and therefore the outer region ( @xmath951.5 ) has a negligible contribution to these spectra . besides , considering the above fact that the sdss and dbsp spectra are almost the same although the three spectra were observed in different time ( sdss : mjd 53224 , nir : mjd 56034 , dbsp : mjd 56771 ) , the variability effect can be ignored .",
    "figure  [ fig : conti ] shows the spectrum combined from the dbsp , sdss , and nir spectra , the overlap parts of which are weighted by spectral s / n .",
    "first , we take a global overview of the features of the agn and starlight components . in  [ subsec : sdssimage ] the 2d imaging decomposition by galfit gives the contributions of the two components . within the 3-diameter aperture ,",
    "the psf ( agn ) component accounts for 59% of the @xmath92-band light , 44% in the @xmath93 , 44% in the @xmath94 , and 67% in the @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the u - band image is much less sensitive , so an accurate decomposition is difficult ; our rough decomposition shows that it is totally dominated by a psf component . according to the 2d decomposition , the colors ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) of the srsic component are ( 0.93 , 0.5 ) , which suggest that the age of the dominating stellar component could be older than 10  gyr @xcite . now looking at the combined spectrum , the typical agn features such as strong broad emission lines and blueshifted absorption lines are significant ;",
    "in contrast , the starlight component is almost lost of any features , except for the appearance of weak caii  h&k and nai  d absorption lines . on the other hand",
    ", the high fir luminosity betrays recent violent star formation activities ( see  2.2 ) , suggestive of the presence of a ( obscured ) young stellar population . meanwhile ,",
    "both the large extinction in the uv and the large balmer decrement of narrow hydrogen emission lines ( see  [ subsec : emissionline ] and table  [ tab : decrement ] ) suggest the star formation region is enshrouded by thick dust . here",
    "we can roughly estimate the lower limit to the extinction for the young stellar population that ionizes the h  ii region and powers the nebular emission lines and fir dust emission . using the sfr estimated from pah ( see  [ subsec : mirspec ] ) and the relation @xmath98 ( erg  s@xmath27 ) , we get the predicted luminosity of h@xmath99  for the hii region , @xmath100 @xmath18 . yet the observed luminosity of the narrow h@xmath99  line @xmath101 ( narrow h@xmath99 ) is only @xmath102 @xmath18 . assuming all the emission of the narrow h@xmath99  component is from star formation , then the extinction for narrow h@xmath99  emission line is @xmath103 = 4.9 ; applying the lmc extinction curve , the @xmath66 of the young stellar population is thus @xmath152.6 .",
    "in addition , the excess emission between @xmath104 and 10  @xmath50 , which appears in this spectrum , has been widely regarded to be originated from the hot dust of @xmath105  k in the studies of agn seds @xcite .    based on the above analysis",
    ", we can decompose the continuum ( 300022000    in rest frame wavelength ) with the following model :    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the observed spectrum in the rest frame , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 are the factors for the respective components ; @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the dust extinction to the agn emission and to the young stellar population , respectively ; and @xmath114 is the planck function . as @xmath99 ( the intrinsic agn continuum slope ) and @xmath115 are somehow degenerate , in the fitting @xmath99 is fixed to @xmath116 while @xmath115 is free , which is the common recipe for reddened agn continua in the literature ( see , e.g. , dong  et  al .  2005 , 2012 , and zhou et  al .",
    "the two stellar populations are modeled by two simple stellar population ( ssp ) templates from @xcite , with the metallicity being fixed to the solar ( @xmath117 ) for simplicity .",
    "a ssp is defined as a stellar population whose star formation duration is short compared with the lifetime of its most massive stars .",
    "based on the analysis in the preceding paragraph , we select 30 ssp templates with ages between 50  myr and 1  gyr to model the young stellar component , and 28 ssp templates with ages between 5  gyr and 12  gyr to model the old stellar component . we traverse every possible ssp template in the library during the fitting , and use the idl routine mpfit @xcite to do the job with @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 being free parameters .",
    "detailedly , as the average qso spectrum reddened with lmc extinction curve by @xmath121 fits this object well ( see figure  [ fig : sed ] ) , the @xmath118 is initially set to be 0.66 and allowed to vary freely within 0.30.8 according to the balmer decrement measured from the broad - line h@xmath99/h@xmath4 ; the @xmath119 is initially set to be 2.6 , varying within 1.03.0 according to the balmer decrement measured from the narrow - line h@xmath99/h@xmath4 ( see table  [ tab : decrement ] ) .",
    "we also set the fraction of the power - law component in the @xmath93 band to be 0.5 initially and allow the value varying within 0.40.6 .",
    "the fitting converges on the two ssp templates with ages of 127  myr and 9  gyr , respectively , @xmath118 of 0.41 , @xmath119 of 2.2 , and @xmath1221394  k that is close to the result of @xcite . as figure  [ fig : conti ] shows ,",
    "the fractions of the decomposed nucleus and starlight components in the spectrum are basically consistent with the imaging decomposition .",
    "the blackbody continuum from the hot dust of the presumable torus should be the dominant emission in the @xmath55 band and the @xmath60 @xmath123 band . to check it",
    ", we extend the fitting result to the @xmath60 @xmath123 band , and find that it can well reproduce the observed data point . as to the best - fit starlight spectrum composed of the two ssp components , it reproduces well the caii  h&k and h@xmath124  absorption lines , yet it overestimates the nai  d absorption .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to the uncertainty of the decomposition or more likely the contamination to the nai  d absorption by the nearby hei@xmath29 emission line .",
    "the concern on the decomposition is mainly about the decomposition of the two stellar components . to assess the reliability of the decomposed stellar components ( mainly of their ages )",
    ", we do the following checks .",
    "first , regardless of the above physical arguments to justify the use of _ two _ ssps , we test this point with the data ( lest the spectral quality should not be sufficient to support it ) . using a single ssp with the metallicity and age being free parameters for the starlight in the model",
    ", we obtain the best fit with a much larger minimum @xmath125 .",
    "the reduced @xmath125  increases by @xmath126 , and the two - ssp model is favored according to @xmath127test ( the chance probability @xmath128 ) .",
    "then we check the algorithm of mpfit for global minimum , as follows .",
    "( 1 ) we loop over the grid of the 28 templates for the old stellar population component and for every case of the assigned template for the old component we get the best - fit young stellar component according to minimum @xmath125 ; these 28 best - fit young populations have ages in the range of 80210  myr .",
    "( 2 ) on the other hand , we loop over the grid of the 30 templates for the young stellar population component and for every case we get the best - fit old component by @xmath125  minimization ; these 30 best - fit old stellar populations have ages in the range of 811  gyr .",
    "we can see that , at least , the ages of the two components can be well separated .",
    "( 3 ) furthermore , considering that the caii  h&k and h@xmath124 absorption lines are dominated by the old stellar component , we devise instead a @xmath125@xmath129 as calculated in the spectral region of 3900 - 4050 in order to better constrain the fitting of the old stellar component .",
    "we repeat the procedure of ( 2 ) yet with minimizing @xmath125@xmath129 . for every case of the held template for the young component ,",
    "the best - fit ssp template for the old component may be different from ( 2 ) . yet the ages of the best - fit old components of all the 30 cases are still in the range of 811  gyr .",
    "certainly , we should note that the above checks do not account for the effect of the internal dust extinction parameters ( see eq .  1 ) , which should impact the fitting of the two stellar components .",
    "since for any a ssp the age and metallicity are degenerate parameters , we also try to model the starlight with two ssps with their age and metallicity set to be free ( allowing @xmath130 = 0.0001 , 0.0004 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 and 0.05 ) .",
    "this test scheme yields that the best - fit two ssps have ages of 47.5  myr and 12  gyr , and both converge to an extremely low metallicity @xmath131 .",
    "such a metallicity is even lower than that of most of the most metal - poor ( dwarf ) galaxies , which is unrealistic for j1634@xmath02049  with a mass / size similar to the milky way . besides",
    ", this scheme does not change much the best - fit starlight ( the sum of the two stellar populations ) : the difference of the starlight between this scheme and the solar metallicity scheme we adopt is 14% in the h@xmath4[oiii ]  region , and only 2% in the @xmath55 band ; the best - fits of the other components ( the reddened agn continuum and the hot dust emission ) change negligibly also . in this present work ,",
    "we use @xmath55-band luminosities to derive stellar masses ( see sections  3.1 and 3.2 ) and do not use stellar age and metallicity to achieve any conclusions . thus , it is safe to assume the solar metallicity for the two ssps in the model .      as the figure  [ fig : conti ] shows , strong emission lines of j1634@xmath02049 display intensively in four spectral regions : h@xmath4  + [ oiii]@xmath132 + feii   multiplets , h@xmath99  + [ nii]@xmath133 + [ sii]@xmath42 , p@xmath134  + hei@xmath30 and p@xmath99  ( note that the p@xmath4  and p@xmath124  emission lines are of low s / n ) .",
    "before we fit the four regions , we first take a look at the profiles of the various emission lines .",
    "figure [ fig : outflow ] shows p@xmath99 , p@xmath134 , hei@xmath30 , h@xmath99 , hei@xmath29 , [ oiii]@xmath28 , h@xmath4 , neiii@xmath135 and [ oiii]@xmath136 emission lines in the common velocity space .",
    "we note the following major points .",
    "( 1 ) the total profiles of the recombination lines ( such as p@xmath99 , p@xmath134 , hei@xmath30 , h@xmath99 , hei@xmath29 and h@xmath4 ) apparently exhibit a narrow peaked component and a lower and broad base ; the two components appears separable from each other .",
    "( 2 ) besides , probably of the most interesting , in h@xmath4  and hei@xmath137 , there clearly exists an extra cuspy narrow component that is blueshifted by a velocity of @xmath138  @xmath7 ; the blueshift velocity is consistent in the three lines .",
    "( 3 ) the whole profile of high - ionization narrow forbidden emission lines , [ oiii]@xmath28 and neiii@xmath135 , is blueshifted evidently , with an offset velocity of @xmath139500  @xmath7  according to the peak of [ oiii]@xmath28 ; this kind of bulk blueshifting seems to be present in the low - ionization forbidden line [ oii]@xmath136 , yet with a smaller blueshift .",
    "we start the line profile fittings with the p@xmath99  emission line , which is the strongest of the hydrogen paschen series , and basically free of blending ( unlike hei@xmath30 ) .",
    "its profile can be used as a template to fit the p@xmath134  @xmath0 hei@xmath30 blends @xcite .",
    "the high contrast between the narrow peak and broad base of the p@xmath99  profile makes it be able to decompose easily into the broad and narrow components .",
    "there is another weak yet significant excess cusp on the blue side of the p@xmath99  profile .",
    "if this cusp belongs to p@xmath99 , its velocity offset is almost the same as the narrow cusp of h@xmath4  mentioned above ( at velocity of @xmath140  @xmath7  in figure  5 ) .",
    "therefore , we take this cusp as the third component of the p@xmath99  profile in the model .",
    "every components are modeled with ( multiple ) gaussians .",
    "initially , the narrow , the blueshifted cuspy , and the broad components are fitted with one gaussian each ; more additional gaussian(s ) can be added into the model for a component if the @xmath141 decreases significantly with an @xmath142-test probability @xmath1430.05 .",
    "a first - order polynomial is adopted to fine - tune the local continuum .",
    "the fitting turns out , with a reduced @xmath125  of 0.99 , that the narrow component and the blueshited cusp are well fitted with a single gaussian each , and the broad component is sufficiently fitted with two gaussians ( see figure  [ fig : linefit ] ) .",
    "the p@xmath134  emission line is heavily blended with the hei@xmath30 emission line .",
    "in addition , two broad hei*@xmath144 absorption troughs are located in the blue wing of the hei@xmath30 emission line , which increases the complexity of decomposing this blend .",
    "we use the p@xmath99  as the template to fit p@xmath134 . to be specific ,",
    "we assume that p@xmath134  has also three components , namely the narrow , broad , and blueshifted cuspy ones , and every component shares the same profile as the corresponding one of p@xmath99 , only with free intensity factors .",
    ", for which we adopt the fitting result with it set to be free ( cf .",
    "table  3 ) .",
    "this is because the narrow p@xmath134  component stands high over the broad component and the fitting can be significantly improved by relaxing its width from being tied to that of narrow p@xmath99 . ]",
    "the profile of the hei@xmath30 emission line is different from that of p@xmath99 , except that its blueshifted cusp is located at a similar blueshifted velocity to the cusps of p@xmath99  and h@xmath4 .",
    "we understand that hei@xmath30 is a high - ionization line ( with a ionization potential of 24.6  ev ) , and it is well known that high - ionization lines generally have a more complex profile than low - ionization lines ( e.g. , civ@xmath145 , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is interpreted by the presence of pronounced other components in high - ionization lines  particularly the emission originated from the agn outflows ",
    "in addition to the normal component emitting from the virialized blr clouds that is located at the systematic redshift ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to get a convergent fitting for the hei  line , we use the profile of the broad p@xmath99  ( namely the two - gaussian model ) as the template to model the virialized broad hei  component , a gaussian to model the nlr - emitted hei , a gaussian to the blueshifted cusp , and as many more gaussians as statistically guaranteed ( namely @xmath127test probability @xmath1430.05 ) to account for the remaining flux . in the fitting the absorption region",

    "the best - fit model is shown in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig : linefit ] with a reduced @xmath146 ; the best - fit parameters as listed in table  3 . besides the virialized broad component , the nlr one and the cusp , finally there are two additional gaussians to account for an extra blueshifted broad component .",
    "this extra component is blueshifted ( by @xmath147  @xmath7 ) , which is consistent with the aforementioned outflow interpretation for the profiles of high - ionization broad lines .",
    "note that such a blueshifting is not a direct identification but merely ascribed to the asymmetry of the broad - line hei@xmath810830 profile , which is different from the situation of the blueshifted narrow cusp component .",
    "hereafter when necessary , for the ease of narration we denote this blueshifted broad component with `` outflow@xmath148 '' , and the blueshifted narrow cusp `` outflow@xmath149 '' .    in the optical ,",

    "this suggests that the blueshifted emission lines are plausibly originated in the absorption line outflows .",
    "if this is the case , we can accurately determine the kinetic properties of the outflows by taking advantages of both the absorption lines and the emission lines .",
    "specifically , the absorption lines , which trace the properties of the outflow in the los , is good at determining the total column density ( @xmath261 ) and the velocity ( gradient ) of the outflow ; the emission lines , which trace the global properties of the outflows , can determine better the total mass and global covering factor of the outflows .    as the first step , we determine the distance ( @xmath312 ) of the outflow ( exactly speaking , the part producing the los absorption ) away from the central source .",
    "the ionization parameter @xmath276 depends on @xmath312 and hydrogen - ionizing photons emitted by the central source ( @xmath313 ) , as follows , @xmath314 where @xmath260 is the density of the outflow and @xmath200 is the speed of light .",
    "the @xmath260 has been estimated as log  @xmath315 @xmath11 . to determine the @xmath313 , we scale the uv - soft sed to the de - reddened flux of j1634@xmath02049  at the @xmath60 @xmath123 band ( @xmath316 ) ( see figure  [ fig : photonumber ] ) , and then integrate over the energy range @xmath317  ev of this scaled sed .",
    "this yields @xmath318 photons s@xmath27 . to check the reliability of this integration ,",
    "we integrate also this scaled sed over the whole energy range and get @xmath319 @xmath18 , which is basically consistent with our estimated @xmath320  independently from the obscuration - corrected continuum luminosity at 5100    ( see  3.1 ) . using this @xmath313 value together with the derived @xmath260 and @xmath276 ,",
    "the @xmath312 value can be derived , as listed in table  [ tab : outflowpar ] . with @xmath312 being 4865  pc ,",
    "the outflow is located exterior to the torus , while the extend of the torus is on the scale of @xmath321  pc .",
    "this result is consistent with our qualitative analysis of the normalization for the intrinsic spectrum underlying the absorption trough ( see  2.4.3 ) .    assuming that the absorbing material can be described as a thin ( @xmath322 ) partially filled shell , the mass - flow rate ( @xmath323 ) and kinetic luminosity ( @xmath324 ) can be derived as follows ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , @xmath325 @xmath326 where @xmath312 is the distance of the outflow from the central source , @xmath327 is the global covering fraction of the outflow",
    ", @xmath328 is the mean atomic mass per proton , @xmath329 is the mass of proton , @xmath261 is the total hydrogen column density of the outflow gas , and @xmath330 is the weight - averaged velocity of the absorption trough , which is directly derived from the trough s profile .",
    "the weight - averaged @xmath330 for the hei*@xmath24 absorption trough is @xmath331  @xmath7 .",
    "note that the outflow velocity ( @xmath330 ) should be calculated with the absorption line velocity , not with the outflowing emission line velocity .",
    "the absorption lines are produced from the absorber moving along our los , whereas the emission lines originates from gas outflowing along different directions with respect to the observer .",
    "thus the observed outflow velocity of an emission line is a sum of the projected velocities of the outflowing gas along different directions , and should be smaller than the outflow velocity of the absorbing material ; this is just as we observed .",
    "we estimated the global covering fraction ( @xmath327 ) for j1634@xmath02049  by comparing the measured ew([oiii]5007 ) with the predicted one by the best _ cloudy _ model ( see  3.4.2 ) .",
    "although to this end , theoretically it is better to use recombination lines such as h@xmath4  and hei@xmath30 ; there is , however , no good measurements of the h@xmath4 for the relatively broad , blueshifted component ( see discussion in  [ subsec : cloudyel ] ) and that component of hei@xmath30 is heavily affected by the absorption trough .",
    "the ew([oiii ] ) value is affected by the dust extinction both to the continuum and the [ oiii ]  @xmath85007 emission .",
    "we make simple and reasonable assumptions as follows ( cf . ",
    "2.4.2 ) : the continuum suffers dust extinction to the same degree of the broad lines with e@xmath332 , and the [ oiii ]  @xmath85007 emission , within the range of dust - free and the broad - line one .",
    "after corrected for the dust extinction , the actual ew([oiii ] ) should be in the range of 4.324.8   . here",
    "the outflowing [ oiii ]  flux is the same as used in ",
    "[ subsec : cloudyel ] and the continuum flux is measured from the decomposed power - law component at 5007 . in",
    "modeling , the emergent [ oiii ]  flux is output with the covering fraction being assumed to be 1 . the derived ew([oiii ] ) is 82    for the model with @xmath333 @xmath11 , and 142    for @xmath334 @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the global cover fraction ( @xmath327 ) for j1634@xmath02049   is estimated to be in the range of 5.230.1% for @xmath333 @xmath11 , or 3.017.4% for @xmath334 @xmath11 .",
    "likewise , we estimate the @xmath327 for the outflow emitting hei@xmath30 , yielding 72.9100% ( the case of @xmath333 @xmath11 ) or 43.771.7% ( @xmath334 @xmath11 ) , which are much lager than those for [ oiii ]  @xmath85007 . the large difference between the @xmath327 values estimated based on hei@xmath30 and [ oiii ] may be mainly due to the measurement uncertainty of the outflowing component of hei@xmath30 , and/or may reflect the inhomogeneity of the outflowing gas .",
    "[ oiii ]  is a forbidden line that traces the region of low density only and hei@xmath30 , a recombination line , can be generated in much broader spatial regions .",
    "here we conservatively adopt the @xmath327 value estimated from [ oiii ] .",
    "thus , the kinetic luminosity and mass loss rate are calculated as summarized in table  [ tab : outflowpar ] .",
    "we performed a comprehensive multiwavelength study of the properties of j1634@xmath02049 , a local quasar with high ir luminosity of @xmath2 and signatures of outflows both in bals and blueshifted emission lines .",
    "the high ir luminosity indicates recent violent star formation activities with sfr = 140 @xmath335 , which is also indicated by the pah emission lines with a derived @xmath336 .",
    "interestingly , in the uv and optical bands there are few signs of star formation activities , and the decomposition of the sdss images demonstrate the host galaxy is of early type in terms of its structural property ( e.g. , srsic @xmath91 ) and the colors ( e.g. , @xmath337 ) .",
    "this quasar has a circumgalactic ring on scales of @xmath338  kpc .",
    "the ring has almost the same colors as the host galaxy ( namely the srsic @xmath91 component ) .",
    "yet it is unclear at this point whether or not the galactic ring has a similar intense dust - enshrouded star formation .",
    "there are two small galaxies to the west of it within 20  on the sky , the three of them being in an almost a linear configuration .",
    "we spectroscopically observed the galaxies and obtained the redshift for the relatively bigger one ( c1 ; the closer to j1634@xmath02049 ) , @xmath339 . in the optical and near - infrared spectra , there are several strong bals and blueshifted emission lines in addition to the normal , blr- and nlr - originated emission lines , suggestive of the agn outflows .",
    "these lines can be used to derive ( mutually constrain ) the physical properties of the outflowing gas by confronting the observed with the modeling results of the photoionization software _",
    "cloudy_. the appearance of the bal of neutral sodium , which is rare in an agn environment , suggests that the outflowing gas is thick and dusty .",
    "the physical parameters we determined with _ cloudy _ for absorption line and emission line outflows are very close , with @xmath340 @xmath11 , @xmath341 and @xmath342 @xmath14 .",
    "this similarity suggests that those absorption and emission lines should be generated in the common outflowing gas . using the absorption lines to derive the total column density of the outflow and the emission lines to obtain the global covering factor",
    ", we estimate the distance of the absorbing material to the central source , @xmath514865  pc , exterior to the torus .",
    "these derived parameters allow us to calculate the kinetic luminosity and mass loss rate of the outflow .",
    "the results listed in table  [ tab : outflowpar ] indicate that the outflow observed in j1634@xmath02049  processes a large kinetic luminosity , which is high enough to play a major role in the agn feedback .",
    "previous studies suggest that agn feedback typically requires a mechanical energy input of roughly 0.55% of eddington luminosity of the quasar to heat the cold gas and quench the star formation activities in the host galaxy ( e.g. , hopkins & elvis 2010 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ) .    taking the multiwavelength results altogether",
    ", we can infer the whole story as follows .",
    "j1634@xmath02049  could have been a disk galaxy with abundant gas , and was collided through by one or two small galaxies with masses of @xmath343 .",
    "the violent head - on collision destroyed the disk and formed a circumgalactic ring .",
    "the collision also triggered violent star formation in the host galaxy , with the star formation regions being heavily reddened by dust now and betraying itself in the ir bands only .",
    "we may infer that the violent star formation is in the circumnuclear region , as the optical images and spectrum demonstrate that the large scale of the host galaxy is an elliptical galaxy dominant by an old stellar population .",
    "indeed , in the generally believed scenario of galaxy merger / collision and agn feedback , as described in the introduction section , the large - scale cold gas of the interacting galaxies loses angular momentum and is driven into the nuclear region due to the gravitational potential well ; the infall of the cold gas triggers nuclear star formation and also feeds the central smbh .",
    "this inference is further supported by the fact that the narrow emission lines ( dominated by the agn according to the bpt diagrams ) as well as the broad emission lines are seriously obscured by dust , hinting at a common origin of the dust to the optical emission of both the agn and star formation .",
    "the existence of neutral sodium bal also indicates that the nuclear region is dusty . with huge kinetic luminosity",
    ", the outflows launched by the agn in turn will blow away the gas and dust around the nucleus and even inhibit the star formation in the host galaxy soon or later , as the co - evolution scenario suggests . at this time point ,",
    "j1634@xmath02049  is just like the prototypal qso / lirg composite object , mrk  231 , in the transitional phase emerging out of the dust .",
    "according to the differences in both the degree of dust extinction and the mid- and far - infrared sed shape between j1634@xmath02049  and mrk  231 , j1634@xmath02049  should be at the phase immediately after mrk  231 in the co - evolutionary sequence .",
    "so it is a rare object for us to detailedly and quantitatively study ( or test ) the co - evolution scenario of galaxy and smbh .",
    "in particular , taking the advantage of its nearness , we will carry out spatially resolved observations of the cold gas distribution and kinematics on the circumgalactic scale ( by , e.g. , jvla ) , or even on the scale within the host galaxy ( by , e.g. , alma ) , to directly investigate the cold gas  the vital starring actor playing in the ( co-)evolutionary scenario .",
