    "orbital degree of freedom of an electron represents a directional aspect of electronic wave function .",
    "it is widely recognized that the orbital degree of freedom influences significantly magnetic , optical , and structural properties in correlated electron materials .",
    "@xcite a macroscopic symmetry breaking of a degenerate orbital wave function , termed an orbital order , is often seen in several transition - metal compounds , rare - earth magnets , as well as molecular solids . a long - range orbital order is generally accompanied with a macroscopic lattice distortion which is compatible to a shape of the electronic wave function .",
    "this is caused by an orbital - lattice interaction known as the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect in a single molecule .    a collective orbital excitation in an orbital ordered state",
    "is termed `` orbital wave '' and its quantized object is termed `` orbiton '' .",
    "this is an analogous to spin - wave excitation in a magnetically ordered state .",
    "several experimental observations of orbiton by optical and raman spectroscopies ,  @xcite x - ray scatterings  @xcite and other experimental probes , as well as theoretical supports  @xcite have been reported so far . nonetheless , characteristics of orbiton have not been revealed yet .",
    "this might be attributed to a fact that coupling between orbiton and lattice is not negligibly small , and an experimental assignment of orbiton is not so simple in comparison with that of magnon .",

    "more realistic calculations of orbital wave were performed by one of the present authors and coworkers in refs .  , where the lattice distortion is interpreted to be frozen .",
    "the adiabatic frozen - lattice treatment  @xcite is justified in the limiting case where the orbital excitation energy is much higher than the phonon energy .",
    "a weak coupling approach for the jt effect was adopted in ref .   where an anticrossing - type mixing between orbiton and phonon branches occurs .",
    "similar linear coupling between orbiton and phonon modes are examined in tmvo@xmath0 and related materials .",
    "@xcite on the other side , vibronic excitations in a single jt center have been examined intensively .",
    "@xcite in particular , local vibronic excitations in an orbital ordered state were studied in ref .  , where multi - peak vibrational excitations with a broad envelop appear due to the franck - condon transitions .",
    "purpose in this paper is to present a theoretical framework of vibronic excitations in orbitally degenerate correlated electron system ; both the local vibronic excitations and the superexchange ( se)-type inter - site interaction between orbitals are taken into account on an equal footing .",
    "we set up a model which consists of the se interactions , the on - site jt coupling and the local lattice vibration . a generalized spin - wave approach where the local vibronic states are fully taken into account is presented .",
    "two characteristic excitation modes coexist ; a low - energy dispersive vibronic mode interpreted as a renormalized `` orbiton '' , and high - energy multi - peaks originating from the franck - condon excitation in a single jt center modified by the se interaction .",
