    "after a short overview of the floquet theories , section 2 shows that the geometric phases involved by the adiabatic floquet theory are generated by a double integration ( rather than a simple integration in the usual geometric phase theory ) .",
    "section 3 describes the geometric structure describing the geometric phases ( an abelian gerbe with connection @xcite ) , and clarifies the signifiance of these double integrated geometric phases .",
    "we show in particular that this more complicated structure is related to the existence of systems having a quasi - energy with non - global continuous definition of the floquet blocks .",
