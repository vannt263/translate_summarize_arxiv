    "the halos and outer disks of spiral galaxies are basic laboratories for studying the formation and evolution of these systems .",
    "numerical simulations predict that halo formation may be an extended , and perhaps even on - going , process that involves the merging of proto - systems having a range of masses and chemical enrichment histories ( e.g. bekki & chiba 2001 ) . the observational evidence that the outer regions of the milky - way contains stars accreted from companion galaxies is now well established .",
    "in particular , there are a handful of globular clusters in the milky - way that are markedly younger than the majority ( e.g. rosenberg et al .",
    "1999 ; buonanno et al .",
    "1998 ; sarajedini , chaboyer , & demarque 1997 ) , as well as tidal streams containing stars that are distinct from those in the present day halo field ( e.g. ibata et al . 2001a ; martinez - delgado et al . 2001 ; helmi & white 1999 ; majewski , munn , & hawley 1994 ) ; similar structures are also seen in the outer regions of m31 ( ibata et al .",
    "2001b ; saito & iye 2000 ) .",
    "the overall structural characteristics of the galactic halo are also consistent with formation driven by hierarchal accretion ( e.g. chiba & beers 2001 ; bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg 2001 ) , although there remain difficulties explaining the presence of a thin disk , given that interactions with satellites heat , and thereby thicken , the disk ( chiba & beers 2001 ) .",
    "it is not clear if the age and metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of halo stars depend on global host galaxy properties such as mass and morphology .",
    "the stochastic processes inherent to hierarchal evolution ( e.g. ct et al . 2000 ) , including differences in the gas fraction of accreted satellites ( harris & harris 2001 ) , are expected to smear any such relations .",
    "studies of the brightest resolved stars in the halos of local group galaxies have revealed intriguing galaxy - to - galaxy differences , although the number of systems studied to date is too small to allow secure trends to be defined .",
    "the halos of m31 , the milky - way , and m33 have very different mean metallicities ( e.g. mould & kristian 1986 - hereafter mk86 ; durrell , harris , & pritchet 1994 , 2001 ) , in the sense that the m31 halo is the most metal - rich of the three .",
    "the globular cluster systems of these galaxies also show differences .",
    "the depths of cn absorption bands in the integrated spectra of m31 and milky - way clusters are suggestive of different chemical mixtures ( burstein et al .",
    "1984 , davidge 1990 ) , while m33 contains a significant number of intermediate age globular clusters ( christian & schommer 1988  hereafter cs88 ; sarajedini et al . 1998 ; chandar et al . 2002 ) that do not have counterparts in either m31 or the milky - way .",
    "with hst the investigation of resolved stars in halos has been expanded to galaxies outside the local group .",
    "harris & harris ( 2000 ; 2001 ) point out that the halo mdf of the elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 , which is more massive than m31 , is similar to the mdfs of systems that are as diverse as m32 ( grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ) , the lmc ( cole , smecker - hane , & gallagher 2000 ) , and the m31 halo ( durrell et al . 2001 ) , which in turn suggests of similarities in their early evolution .",
    "disks are thought to form from material that was subjected to tidal torques during early epochs ( e.g. zurek , quinn , & salmon 1988 ) .",
    "feedback from star formation , coupled with interactions between the host galaxy and satellites on plunging orbits , will heat proto - disk material and thereby delay disk formation ( e.g. weil , eke , & efstathiou 1998 ) . in the case of the milky - way , the oldest stars in the galactic disk have ages that are consistently lower than those infered for typical globular clusters ( e.g. oswalt et al . 1996 ; leggett , ruiz , & bergeron 1998 ; knox , hawkins , & hambly 1999 ; liu & chaboyer 2000 , but see also binney , dehnen , & bertelli 2000 ) , which is consistent with a hiatus between the formation of the halo and the disk .",
    "in fact , the youngest globular clusters have ages that are similar to the oldest disk stars , suggesting that the formation of the galactic disk commenced only after the conditions required to form globular clusters were suppressed .    disks might be expected to form from the inside out , as the low densities of the outer disk make these regions more fragile than the inner disk , and hence more easily disrupted by disturbances from nearby satellites .",
    "the outer disk may also experience delayed star formation if infall and the viscous transport of material from smaller radii have comparable time scales ( e.g. ferguson & clarke 2001 ) .",
    "the inside - out disk formation model is supported by the presence of age gradients in the disks of nearby galaxies , in the sense that mean age decreases ( becomes younger ) towards larger radii ( e.g. bell & de jong 2000 ) .",
    "there is also a tendency for the region near the disk boundary in edge - on systems to be bluer than in the rest of the disk , as expected if the disk / halo interface is dominated by young stars , although there are some exceptions ( de grijs , kregel , & wesson 2001 ) .",
    "deep photometric studies of the resolved stellar contents of nearby spiral galaxies offer a direct means of probing the evolution of the outer regions of these systems . in this paper",
    "deep @xmath0 images obtained with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) on gemini north are used to probe the bright stellar content in the outer regions of the nearby sc galaxies m33 and ngc 2403 .",
    "the fields observed in these galaxies have similar galactocentric radii , r@xmath12 , thereby permitting a direct comparison of stellar contents .",
    "ngc 2403 and m33 have roughly the same m@xmath13 , morphology , inclination , gas - phase metal abundances ( garnett et al . 1997 ) , and star - forming histories in the inner disk ( davidge & courteau 2002 ) ; hence , they are well matched for a comparative study .",
    "these galaxies also share a common peculiarity , in that both are experiencing vigorous star formation in the inner disk , even though the gas densities in these same regions appear to be too low to trigger the collapse instabilities required for star formation ( kennicutt 1989 ; martin & kennicutt 2001 ) .",
    "these similarities aside , m33 and ngc 2403 are located in slightly different environments . while both galaxies are in a hierarchal system with a larger sb galaxy , ngc 2403",
    "is @xmath14 mpc from m81 ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2000 ) , while m33 is only @xmath15 mpc from m31 .",
    "furthermore , the m81 group contains dwarf galaxies that do not have known local group counterparts ( caldwell et al 1998 ) , and this might affect evolution driven by satellite accretion .",
    "the distance moduli and reddenings adopted for m33 and ngc 2403 throughout this study are listed in table 1 .",
    "the distance modulus for ngc 2403 in table 1 is based on cepheids , and in  4 it is demonstrated that the cepheid and rgb - tip distances for ngc 2403 are in good agreement . as for m33 , cepheids and the rgb - tip give distance moduli that differ by 0.3 dex ( e.g. lee et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the rgb - tip distance measured by kim et al .",
    "( 2002 ) has been adopted for this study as it is likely less susceptible to internal reddening .",
    "the observations and data reduction techniques are discussed in  2 , while details of the photometric measurements are presented in  3 .",
    "the ngc 2403 field samples a range of environments , and in  4 , 5 , and 6 the stellar contents of three distinct regions , that sample the outer star - forming disk , the disk / halo interface , and the halo , are discussed .",
    "the stellar content of the m33 field , which samples a region outside the active star - forming disk , is investigated in  7 .",
    "a discussion and summary of the results follows in  8 .",
    "the data were recorded during semester 2001b as part of the system verification program for the gmos ( crampton et al .",
    "2002 ) on gemini north .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 images were obtained of fields along the minor axes of ngc 2403 and m33 ; control fields were also observed to monitor contamination from foreground stars and background galaxies . the right ascensions and declinations of the various fields",
    "are listed in table 2 , while the locations of the ngc 2403 and m33 fields on the palomar sky survey are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the m33 and ngc 2403 fields have the same central r@xmath12 , although a smaller portion of m33 is sampled than ngc 2403 because of the difference in distance .",
    "in fact , the distance to ngc 2403 is such that the gmos field samples a swath from the star - forming disk to the halo of the galaxy .",
    "the data were recorded using a 6 point dither pattern so that the gaps between the individual ccds that make up the gmos detector mosaic could be filled when constructing the final images .",
    "each ccd output was binned @xmath18 during read - out , so each superpixel covers 0.145 arcsec on a side .",
    "exposure times were selected using the gmos integration time calculator ( itc ) to allow stars on the upper rgb in each galaxy to be detected at the 5 to @xmath19 level during median conditions . in general , the delivered photometric performance is consistent with the itc predictions .",
    "various details of the observations , including exposure time and delivered image quality , are listed in table 2 .",
    "the exposure times of the ngc 2403 background field @xmath20 observations are much shorter than originally intended as the seeing suddenly degraded on the night these data were recorded , making it necessary to stop prematurely these observations .",
    "the data were reduced with tasks in the gemini iraf package , using bias frames and twilight sky flats that were recorded at the beginning and/or end of each night . the data reduction sequence consisted of ( 1 ) balancing ccd - to - ccd gain differences , ( 2 ) subtracting the bias pattern and dc bias level , ( 3 ) dividing by twilight sky flat - field frames , and ( 4 ) mosaicking the bias - subtracted and flat - fielded outputs from the individual ccd amplifiers to create a single image .",
    "interference fringes were removed from the @xmath21 and @xmath17 data by subtracting fringe frames that were constructed by combining flat - fielded images of various fields recorded through these filters .",
    "the final images for photometric analysis were constructed by spatially aligning the individual images for each field , median - combining the results , and then trimming to the region of common sky coverage .",
    "the final @xmath21 images of each galaxy and the corresponding control field are shown in figures 3 ( ngc 2403 ) and 4 ( m33 ) .",
    "the diffuse object near the eastern edge of the ngc 2403 control field is the dwarf irregular galaxy kar 50 , and the photometric properties of resolved stars in this system were the subject of a separate paper ( davidge 2002 ) .",
    "the photometric measurements were made with the point - spread function ( psf ) fitting routine allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) .",
    "psfs were constructed by combining approximately 50 bright stars per image with the daophot ( stetson 1987 ) psf task .",
    "because the psf stars are bright and relatively isolated , they were also used to determine aperture corrections , which were measured after subtracting neighboring sources .",
    "the photometric measurements are in the vega - based @xmath0 system described by fukugita et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and the calibration was set using standard star observations that were obtained during each observing run .",
    "the estimated uncertainty in the calibration is @xmath22 mag , and this is borne out by the reasonably good agreement with fiducial sequences on the @xmath23 two - color diagrams ( tcds ) .",
    "artificial star experiments were run to assess completeness , estimate photometric uncertainties , and establish a simple means of identifying obviously extended objects .",
    "this latter step was done by rejecting objects having a daophot ` sharp ' parameter that differed at the @xmath24 or higher level from that predicted for point sources .",
    "the artificial stars were assigned colors that are typical of real stars in the data , and the completeness fractions in @xmath20 and @xmath21 for each field are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the ngc 2403 gmos field contains a mix of populations .",
    "young disk stars dominate in the lower right hand corner of figure 1 , while older stars dominate in the upper left hand corner . given this gradient in stellar content ,",
    "the ngc 2403 field was divided into three regions , which are indicated in figure 3 .",
    "the boundary between regions i and ii roughly tracks the drop - off in the bright blue main sequence component .",
    "deep imaging studies of edge - on spiral galaxies indicate that disks terminate over a @xmath25 kpc interval ( e.g. van der kruit & searle 1981 ; de grijs et al . 2001 ) , and region ii probes the stellar content in a 1 kpc interval beyond the outer edge of region i. region iii occupies the remainder of the gmos field .",
    "the hi disk of ngc 2403 extends into regions ii and iii ( fraternali et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the control field was similarly divided so that identical areas are covered when making comparisons between the galaxy and control datasets . for the remainder of the paper regions in the galaxy fields",
    "are designated with the subscript ` g ' , while regions in the control fields are indicated with the subscript ` c ' .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 luminosity functions ( lfs ) of region i@xmath26 , corrected for incompleteness and contamination from sources in the corresponding portion of the control field , are shown in figure 6 .",
    "there is a large number of objects belonging to ngc 2403 in region i@xmath26 , with the onset occuring near @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the majority of sources with @xmath29 are evolving on the rgb (  4.3 ) .    the majority of sources in regions i@xmath26 and i@xmath30 have stellar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , and this is demonstrated in figures 7 and 8 , where the @xmath23 and @xmath31 tcds of sources in these regions are compared .",
    "the stellar sequence from figure 3 of schneider et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter sdss ) and the log(g ) = 2.5 and 4.5 solar metallicity models from tables 9 and 4 of lenz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are also shown in these figures . while the majority of sources follow the sdss sequence on both tcds when @xmath32 , there are stars in region i@xmath26 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 that fall well off of the sdss sequence on the @xmath23 tcd , and stars with similar photometric properties do not occur in region i@xmath30 .",
    "we suggest that the stars with @xmath34 are red giants that are reddened by dust belonging to ngc 2403 .",
    "that the stars with @xmath34 form a more - or - less continuous sequence indicates that the stellar content of region i@xmath26 is not subject to uniform levels of internal extinction ; rather , there is differential extinction ranging up to a@xmath35 mag , which corresponds to a@xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is also clear from figure 7 that not all giants in region i@xmath26 are affected by large amounts of internal extinction .",
    "the level of internal extinction predicted from the @xmath23 tcd is consistent with the range calculated from the balmer decrement in ngc 2403 hii regions ( mccall , rybski , & shields 1985 ; petersen & gammelgaard 1996 ) ; for comparison , the statistical prescription of tully & fouqu ( 1985 ) predicts a mean internal extinction of a@xmath38 mag ( a@xmath39 mag ) for ngc 2403 ( pierce & tully 1992 ) .",
    "the region i@xmath26 and i@xmath30 data tend to have @xmath40 colors that are smaller at a fixed @xmath41 than predicted from the sdss sequence . in the case of region",
    "i@xmath26 , the offset with respect to the sdss data is in the range 0.05  0.10 mag along the @xmath40 axis when @xmath42 , and so is within the expected uncertainty in the photometric calibration .",
    "however , when @xmath43 there is a population of objects that are offset from the sdss sequence by 0.2  0.3 mag in @xmath40 , and hence appear to have non - stellar seds .",
    "this part of the @xmath31 tcd is populated by high redshift qsos ( fan 1999 ) , although the density of these objects on the sky is too low to produce the number of sources found here ( anderson et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 cmds of regions i@xmath26 and i@xmath30 are plotted in figures 9 , 10 , and 11 .",
    "the faint limits of the region i@xmath26 and i@xmath30 data differ because of differences in image quality ( e.g. figure 5 ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is a clear population of stars belonging to ngc 2403 in each of the region i@xmath26 cmds .",
    "region i@xmath26 contains a population of sources with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and the location of these objects on the tcds indicate that they have stellar seds .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in the left hand panel of figure 9 show the main sequence defined by ob stars in the milky - way and lmc , translated to match the distance to ngc 2403 .",
    "the main sequence relation was obtained by transforming the relation between m@xmath49 and effective temperature listed by humphreys & mcelroy ( 1984 ) into the sdss photometric system using the relations between ( 1 ) @xmath50 and @xmath51 given by krisciunas , margon , and szkody ( 1998 ) and ( 2 ) @xmath47 and effective temperature predicted by the solar metallicity log(g ) = 4.5 lenz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) models .",
    "the dashed line shows the main sequence reddened only by line - of - sight extinction from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , while the solid line shows the main sequence reddened by the foreground and a uniform sheet of internal extinction with @xmath52 , which the distribution of stars on the @xmath23 tcd suggests is the maximum internal extinction for red giants in region i@xmath26 ( see above ) .",
    "the amount of reddening in a galaxy is population dependent , in the sense that it is higher for young ob stars than for red giants , since stars diffuse away from dusty star - forming regions as they age ( e.g. zaritsky 1999 ) .",
    "the predicted location of the main sequence with only foreground reddening lies at the left hand edge of the blue stellar content in the region i@xmath26 cmd , indicating that not all of the main sequence stars in region i@xmath26 are subject to significant internal extinction . the predicted main sequence with internal reddening of a@xmath53 mag passes through a group of stars with @xmath50 between 24 and 23 , and if these are actual main sequence stars then they have intrinsic brightnesses comparable to the brightest main sequence stars in the galaxy and the lmc .    the brightest blue and red stars in region i@xmath26 are likely supergiants .",
    "to demonstrate this point , the locus defined by type ia supergiants in the galaxy and magellanic clouds , based on the m@xmath49 and effective temperatures listed in humphreys & mcelroy ( 1984 ) and transformed into the sdss photometric system using the procedure described above for the main sequence relation , is also shown on figure 9 for the two reddening situations described above . the ia supergiant sequence in figure 9 with an internal extinction of a@xmath53 mag defines the upper envelope of blue stars in region i@xmath26 , with four stars falling along this sequence .",
    "the presence of bright supergiants and main sequence stars indicates that region i@xmath26 is a site of recent star formation ; region i@xmath26 is thus part of the active star - forming disk of ngc 2403 .",
    "the rgb - tip in moderately metal - poor globular clusters occurs near m@xmath54 and m@xmath55 ( davidge et al .",
    "2002 ) , which corresponds to @xmath56 and @xmath57 at the distance of ngc 2403 with no internal reddening , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 with internal reddening of a@xmath53 mag ; the rgb - tip thus falls near the faint limits of the @xmath44 and @xmath46 cmds .",
    "however , a large population of red stars is seen in the @xmath45 cmd of region i@xmath26 when @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath21 lf of sources with @xmath41 between 0.2 and 0.7 in region i@xmath26 , which is the color range containing the greatest density of rgb stars , is shown in figure 12 .",
    "the rate of evolution on the rgb is insensitive to metallicity ( e.g. vandenberg 1992 ) , and so the power - law exponent that characterizes the rgb lf does not vary greatly with metallicity .",
    "the lf of rgb stars in globular clusters follows a power law with @xmath60 when [ fe / h ] @xmath61 ( davidge et al .",
    "2002 ) , and a least squares fit to the lf entries when @xmath21 is between 23.6 and 25.0 indicates that the exponent is @xmath62 , which is higher than that measured in metal - poor globular clusters .",
    "the fitted relation is compared with the observed lf in figure 12 , and there is a tendency for the fitted relation to fall above the lf entries when @xmath63 , indicating that the rgb - tip brightness in ngc 2403 is @xmath3 ; to the best of our knowledge , this is the first detection of the rgb - tip in ngc 2403 .",
    "the cepheid and rgb - tip distance moduli of m33 differ by 0.3 dex , presumably due to internal extinction ( lee et al . 2002 ) ; is this also the case for ngc 2403 ? using the cepheid distance modulus for ngc 2403 listed in table 1 , and assuming that the majority of rgb - tip stars in region i@xmath26 are subject to foreground reddening , then the intrinsic brightness of the rgb - tip in region i@xmath26 is m@xmath64 ; the last term is the correction for extinction due to forground dust using @xmath65 from table 6 of schlegel et al .",
    "this value of m@xmath66 is consistent with that found in metal - poor globular clusters and the dwarf spheroidal galaxy and v by davidge et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . while the rgb stars in region i@xmath26 are moderately metal - rich (  8) , the rgb - tip brightness in the near - infrared does not change markedly with metallicity when [ fe / h ] @xmath67 ( da costa & armandroff 1990 )",
    "thus , the cepheid and rgb - tip distances for ngc 2403 are consistent .",
    "the mean color and width of the rgb provides information about the chemical composition of old and intermediate age populations . in the current study",
    ", we use @xmath41 to probe rgb color , as the data in @xmath50 and @xmath21 go much deeper than the rgb - tip , sample red populations ( e.g. figure 10 ) , and are less susceptible to line blanketing than data recorded at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. bica , barbuy , & ortolani 1991 ) .",
    "the histogram distribution of @xmath41 colors of sources in region i@xmath26 with @xmath21 between 24 and 25 , corrected for sources in the same brightness interval in region i@xmath30 , is shown in the top panel of figure 13 .",
    "the analysis is restricted to stars with @xmath21 between 24.0 and 25.0 as the @xmath50 and @xmath21 data are 100% complete at these brightnesses over the range of rgb colors .",
    "the @xmath41 distribution for region i@xmath26 has a broad peak , due to the rgb , with a secondary peak when @xmath68 , which is due to bright main sequence stars (  4.2 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath41 colors about the red peak is symmetric , and the mean , based on the data in bins between 0.0 and 1.0 , is @xmath69 , where the uncertainty is the standard error in the mean . the width of the @xmath41 distribution is dominated by photometric errors . to demonstrate this point ,",
    "the gaussian error distribution predicted from the artificial star experiments , scaled to match the number of stars between @xmath70 and 0.7 , is compared with the observed distribution in figure 13 , and there is excellent agreement with the observations .",
    "differential reddening of size @xmath71a@xmath53 mag does not contribute significantly to the width of the observed color distribution .",
    "if the standard deviation of the internal extinction is one half of the total internal extinction ( i.e. @xmath72 mag ) , then the dispersion along the @xmath41 axis due to differential reddening is @xmath73 .",
    "the result of adding this component in quadrature to that due to photometric errors is to broaden the total predicted color distribution by only an additional @xmath74 mag .",
    "agb stars are seen above the rgb - tip in the region i@xmath26 cmds .",
    "stars near the agb - tip have low temperatures , and line blanketing can suppress the brightnesses of these objects at visible wavelengths , causing the agb to be a near horizontal sequence on cmds .",
    "the effects of line blanketing become smaller towards longer wavelengths , and the agb is a vertical sequence on the @xmath46 cmd of region i@xmath26 .",

    "the disks in ngc 2403 and m33 have scale lengths of @xmath165 kpc ( kent 1987a , b ) , and so the stellar disks of these systems might be expected to truncate at r@xmath166 kpc .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the outer boundary of region i@xmath26 , where there is a clear drop in the blue main sequence component .",
    "the presence of bright agb stars in ngc 2403 region iii@xmath26 indicates that star formation occured over a much larger range of r@xmath2 in ngc 2403 during intermediate epochs than in the present - day star - forming disk .",

    "1998 , chandar et al .",
    "2002 , ma et al . 2002a , b ) , and many of these are located at large r@xmath12 ( e.g. figure 3 of cs88 ) , placing them outside of the main body of the disk .",

    "m33 and ngc 2403 are not unique among nearby spiral galaxies in having intermediate - age populations outside of their active star - forming disks , as ferguson & johnson ( 2001 ) found main sequence stars with a mass of 3 m@xmath170 in a semi - major axis field 30 kpc from the center of m31",
    ". however , the outer regions of m31 do not contain the young and intermediate age globular clusters seen in m33 and ngc 2403 .",
    "this could indicate that the intermediate - age field populations in the outer regions of m31 have a smaller fractional size than in m33 and ngc 2403 , or that there is a difference in origin .",
    "did the luminous agb stars in ngc 2403 and m33 form in situ , or did they form in a satellite ( or satellites ) that was ( were ) accreted during recent epochs ?",
    "an accretion origin is attractive because satellite systems at moderately large r@xmath12 may be able to retain gas up to recent epochs , and hence provide a reservoir of material for star formation .",
    "however , late satellite accretion does not provide an ironclad explanation for the origin of bright agb stars in the outer regions of ngc 2403 and m33 .",
    "in particular , if the halo potentials of these galaxies are near spherical , as predicted by simulations ( e.g. bekki & chiba 2001 ) , then the rate of precession will be modest and tidal streams will not smear markedly with time ( ibata et al .",
    "the agb stars in m33 and ngc 2403 appear not to be in stream - like structures .",
    "in fact , the uniformity of the quantity r@xmath100 , defined in  5 , with radius in ngc 2403 , even when including fields that sample the young disk , requires that the tidally accreted material would have to be well - mixed within the host galaxy .    the tendency for r@xmath100 not to change with radius in ngc 2403 suggests that the bright agb stars formed in situ .",
    "are the conditions in the outer regions of ngc 2403 and m33 at the present epoch such that star formation can occur ?",
    "star formation is suppressed when the ratio of the local gas density to the density required to maintain stability based on the toomre criterion drops below @xmath171 ( kennicutt 1989 ; martin & kennicutt 2001 ) . figure 8 of martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) indicates that the gas density in ngc 2403 exceeds that required for star formation out to large radii , so it presumably should not be difficult to spur star formation at large r@xmath12 in ngc 2403 .    figure 13 of martin & kennicutt ( 2001 ) indicates that m33 does not contain an extended gas envelope with a density that is high enough to form stars according to the standard kennicutt ( 1989 ) threshold .",
    "nevertheless , the hi envelope of m33 contains structure ( corbelli , schneider , & salpeter 1989 ) , and star formation can occur in regions where the mean gas density is lower than the critical value ( e.g. ferguson et al .",
    "1998 ) , since random perturbations and spiral density waves can cause localized gas compression , and thereby trigger star formation ( e.g. kennicutt 1989 , ferguson et al .",
    "1998 , martin & kennicutt 2001 ) .",
    "if star formation is triggered by such processes then it might be anticipated that the star - forming history in the outermost regions of a galaxy will be less continuous than at smaller radii .",
    "this being said , the similar agb contents of regions i@xmath26 , ii@xmath26 , and iii@xmath26 and hudon et al .",
    "( 1989 ) fields @xmath128 indicates that star formation in the outer most region of ngc 2403 has been coherent over galaxy - wide spatial scales when averaged over gyr time scales .    both regions ii@xmath26 and iii@xmath26 sample the outer hi disk of ngc 2403 , and if the intermediate age stars formed from material from this gas reservoir then they might be expected to fall along the plane of the hi disk and have disk - like kinematics .",
    "investigations of the number density of bright agb stars in different fields in the outer regions of m33 and ngc 2403 , coupled with spectroscopic studies to obtain kinematic information , will ultimately provide the information needed to chart the spatial distribution of these objects . however , there are tantalizing indications that the intermediate age globular clusters in late - type spiral galaxies do not belong to a disk .",
    "for example , chandar et al . (",
    "2002 ) find that many of the intermediate age clusters in m33 do not have disk - like kinematics , but appear to belong to a pressure - supported halo .",
    "moreover , kissler - patig et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have found a population of blue clusters well off of the disk of the edge - on sc galaxy ngc 5907 .",
    "bekki & chiba ( 2001 ) investigated the formation of halos in the context of cmd - based models , and suggested that the amount of halo flattening depends on host galaxy morphology , in the sense that late - type systems have flatter inner halos .",
    "these simulations predict that a flattened inner halo in late - type spirals ( 1 ) forms well after the more spherically distributed outer halo , and ( 2 ) contains younger stars , which formed during the dissipative merging of gas - rich satellites , than the outer halo .",
    "the luminous agb stars that occur outside of the actively star - forming disks of m33 and ngc 2403 may be the remnants of the final collapse phase of these systems .",
    "such a delayed formation model is consistent with the morphological evolution of sc galaxies with redshift , in that these systems are observed to become increasingly chaotic at intermediate redshifts ( van den bergh 2002 ) .",
    "there is an obvious need to investigate additional fields sampling a larger range of r@xmath12 in m33 and ngc 2403 , as studies of the spatial distribution of agb stars in the outer regions of these galaxies will provide clues about the origin of intermediate age populations at large r@xmath12 .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic surveys of the m33 and ngc 2403 globular cluster systems will also provide additional insight into the star - forming histories of the outer regions of these galaxies .",
    "contamination from background galaxies and foreground stars , which our data demonstrates is already significant at the brightness of the rgb - tip when r@xmath172 kpc in m33 , will become an even greater issue at larger radii , and spectra will become increasingly important for identifying stars that belong to either galaxy . while spectroscopic observations of rgb - tip stars in local group galaxies are feasible with existing 8  10 metre telescopes , studies of more distant systems , like ngc 2403 , must await 20  30 metre facilities .",
    "nevertheless , infrared colors and narrow - band photometry , which can be obtained for these stars using @xmath173 metre telescopes , offer one means of distinguishing between halo and contaminating stars in an efficient manner ; not only are stars near the agb - tip relatively bright in @xmath174 , but the near - infrared seds of dwarfs and giants differ , so that foreground stars can be identified .",
    "the late - type sculptor group galaxies ngc 55 and ngc 247 are potentially interesting targets for surveys of bright agb stars at large r@xmath12 .",
    "like m33 and ngc 2403 , ngc 55 and ngc 247 are sc galaxies .",
    "ngc 55 and ngc 247 have distances that are intermediate between m33 and ngc 2403 , and are located near the south galactic pole , so that there will be lower contamination from foreground stars than in either ngc 2403 or m33 .",
