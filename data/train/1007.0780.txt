    "the no - cloning theorem  @xcite states that no quantum - mechanical evolution exists which would transform an unknown quantum state @xmath0 according to @xmath1 .",
    "this is provided by the linearity of quantum mechanics .",
    "the no - cloning theorem guaranties , e.g. , the security ( privacy ) of quantum - communication protocols including quantum key distribution .",
    "exact cloning is impossible ; however , imperfect ( optimal ) cloning is possible as it was first shown by buek and hillery @xcite by designing a @xmath2 cloning machine , referred to as the _ universal cloner _ ( uc ) .",
    "the cloning machine prepares two approximate copies of an unknown pure qubit state .",
    "the uc generates two qubit states with the same fidelity @xmath3 .",
    "fidelities of the clones to the initial pure state are equal @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the uc is a state - independent symmetric cloner .",
    "it was later shown that for the @xmath5 uc , a relation between the optimum fidelity @xmath6 of each copy and the number @xmath7 of copies is given by @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath9 corresponds to a classical copying process with @xmath10 , which is the best fidelity that one can achieve with only classical operations .",
    "further works have extended the concept to include cloning of qudits , cloning of continuous - variable systems or state - dependent cloning ( non - universal cloning ) , which can produce clones of a specific set of qubits with much higher fidelity than the uc  @xcite ( see also reviews  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the study of the state - dependent cloning machines is important because it is often the case that we have some _ a priori _ information on a given quantum state that we want to clone , but we do not know it exactly . then , by employing the available _ a priori _ information , we can design a cloning machine which outperforms the uc for some specific set of qubits .",
    "for example , if it is known that the qubit is chosen from the equator of the bloch sphere then the so - called _ phase - covariant cloners _ ( pccs ) have been designed  @xcite , and it was shown to be optimal providing a higher fidelity than the uc .",
    "phase - covariant cloning of qubits has been further explored .",
    "for example , fiurek  @xcite studied the pccs with known expectation value of pauli s @xmath11 operator and provided two optimal symmetric cloners : one for the states in the lower and the other for those in the upper hemisphere of the bloch sphere .",

    "another example is the uc , which enables an optimal incoherent attack on the six - state protocol  @xcite .",
    "our paper is devoted to _ phase - independent cloning _ , which refers to cloning of qubits assuming that their distribution ( symmetrical around the bloch vector ) is _ a priori _ known .",

    ", we find that phase - independent cloning can be implemented analogously to the mpcc , e.g. , in linear - optical systems  @xcite or quantum dots  @xcite ( see also ref .",

    "phase - independent cloning is an example of the optimal cloning problem being invariant with respect to the discrete weyl - heisenberg group ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we also show here that the phase - independent cloning exhibits sudden change in average single - copy fidelity , when the symmetry of the system is reduced from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a general transformation describing an optimal symmetric @xmath14 cloning of a qubit . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the optimal symmetric @xmath2 cloning of a qubit knowing _ a priori _ its axisymmetric distribution on the bloch sphere .",
    "this cloning is referred to as the optimal phase - independent cloning . in sec .",
    "iv , we analyze two examples of such cloning of qubits described by the von mises - fisher and brosseau distributions . in sec .",
    "v , we present , probably the most important result of the paper , the optimality proof for the phase - independent cloning transformation . in sec .",
    "vi , we describe a quantum circuit implementing the optimal phase - independent cloning .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "suppose we want to clone a set of qubits , for which some characteristic point is in the following _ a priori _ known pure state : @xmath15 which is parametrized by polar @xmath16 and azimuthal @xmath17 angles on the bloch sphere .",
    "we can express all other qubit states as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a state orthogonal to @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "note that @xmath22 is equal to the scalar product of the bloch vectors @xmath23 $ ] and describes an elevation of an arbitrary qubit with respect to the reference qubit @xmath20 , whereas @xmath24 angle is an azimuth .",
    "please note , however , that @xmath25 is measured from @xmath20 .",
    "the quality of the cloning can be described by the fidelity of a single clone defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the reduced density matrix of the @xmath28th clone ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 denotes summation modulo 2 . to obtain an optimal cloner for an arbitrary distribution of qubits , we use average single - copy fidelity @xmath6 in a way similar to that used for the mpcc  @xcite .",

    "the optimal cloning transformation can be found by maximizing single - copy fidelity @xmath35 , where @xmath36 or @xmath37 , averaged over the distribution @xmath32 representing the frequency of occurrence of the considered qubits  @xcite .",
    "note that distributions @xmath38 describe our classical knowledge about qubits to be cloned .",
    "thus , the distributions @xmath38 are classical although cloning is quantum . probably all works on optimal quantum cloning are concerned with cloning of pure quantum states .",
    "indeed , a generic quantum cloning task for pure states can be formulated such that the state to be cloned is drawn from a certain ensemble of pure states with some _ a priori _ probability and sent to the cloning machine which should produce replicas of the input state .",
    "the quality of the cloner is then usually characterized by mean clone fidelity averaged over the whole ensemble .",
    "the probability distribution characterizing the ensemble of states which one wants to clone is given by @xmath38 in our case .",
    "so , @xmath38 is a classical probability distribution on a unit sphere",
    ".    an optimal symmetric @xmath39 cloning transformation must be symmetric with respect to the swap operation on clones .",
    "so , if we neglect the phase relations , the optimal transformation for an arbitrary distribution of qubits can be expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and subscripts 1 and 2 denote the clones whereas 3 denotes the ancillary qubit .",
    "the angles @xmath43 and @xmath44 are found by maximizing the average single - copy fidelity .",
    "it is worth noting that we are _ not _ analyzing an optimal cloning of mixed qubit states given by @xmath45 by contrast , we are analyzing cloning of each of the pure qubit states from an ensemble separately . while the distribution @xmath32 is a weight function for a single - copy fidelity of a qubit state @xmath46 .",
    "in the following , for simplicity , we consider only axisymmetric distributions .",
    "the symmetry of the distributions means that the cloning transformation is phase - independent ( does not depend on azimuthal angle @xmath24 ) , i.e. , distributions of qubits to be cloned are symmetrical along an arbitrary @xmath20 axis . moreover , we first postulate ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath47 and then ( in sec .",
    "v ) we prove that such transformation is optimal for cloning .    when @xmath48 , see eq .",
    "( [ n01 ] ) , all the formulas can be rewritten in a computational basis by simply substituting @xmath20 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "please note that one can proceed also in the opposite direction ; i.e. , one can start assuming that the distributions are centered around poles of the bloch sphere ( a local coordinate system ) and later transformed to the basis so that the states match in , e.g. , the laboratory frame ( a global coordinate system ) .",
