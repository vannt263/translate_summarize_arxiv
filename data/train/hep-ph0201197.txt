    "when a @xmath4 meson decays into light mesons , we can explore different kinematic regions depending on the momenta carried by the light mesons .",
    "when a light meson is emitted from a heavy quark with momentum of order @xmath6 , this decay can be successfully described by the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "the momentum of a heavy quark can be decomposed as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the residual momentum of order @xmath6 .",
    "the leading contribution to the decay corresponds to the partonic result , and the corrections can be systematically expanded in power series of @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",
    "inclusive decays of heavy mesons with large momentum transfer can be treated in the hqet with the operator product expansion @xcite .",
    "exclusive decays with heavy - heavy currents and heavy - light currents can also be treated in the context of the hqet @xcite .",
    "if a light meson from @xmath4 decays carries a large energy , hqet alone is no longer useful since the large energy of a light meson can be as large as @xmath10 .",
    "then an expansion in @xmath9 alone is not appropriate . in this case , however , we can construct a different type of an effective theory by taking the energy @xmath0 of the energetic light quark to infinity . in this limit , nonperturbative effects can also be systematically obtained .",
    "in fact , this effective theory is more complicated than the hqet and the naive power counting in @xmath11 should be modified since the system involves several energy scales .",
    "another complication arises in decays of a heavy quark with an energetic light quark due a sudakov logarithm since there are both collinear and infrared divergences @xcite .",
    "there has been some discussion of summing sudakov logarithms using effective field theories @xcite .",
    "such an approach has an advantage over conventional methods since effective theories are valid beyond perturbation theory , and it is straightforward to go beyond the leading approximation by including higher - dimensional operators .",
    "the main advantage of using effective theories in this case is that we can reproduce the sudakov logarithm easily without dividing all the kinematic regions @xcite , and the calculation is manifest in the calculational procedure .",
    "however , we need an effective theory in which logarithms arising at one loop in the effective theory should match logarithms arising at one loop in qcd for any matching scale @xmath12 in the minimal subtraction scheme . only in this case",
    ", these logarithms may be summed using the renormalization group equations .",
    "the large - energy effective theory suggested by dugan and grinstein @xcite does not satisfy this criterion since it does not include the effects of collinear gluons properly .",
    "recently bauer et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a new effective theory called the `` collinear - soft effective theory '' . if a light quark moves with a large energy , the momentum has three distinct scales .",
    "the momentum component in the light cone direction @xmath13 is the largest , of the order of the energy of the quark , @xmath0 .",
    "the transverse momentum is smaller than @xmath0 , and the momentum component opposite to the light cone direction is the smallest . in order to disentangle the three scales conveniently , a small parameter @xmath3 is introduced .",
    "the largest component has the momentum of order @xmath0 .",
    "the transverse component is of order @xmath14 , and the smallest component is of order @xmath15 .    between @xmath0 and @xmath14",
    ", we have collinear modes and soft modes for the light quark . here we integrate out all the collinear modes above some scale @xmath12 , and the result is the effective theory consisting of collinear quarks and soft quarks . the effective theory at this stage",
    "is called the collinear - soft effective theory , which we will call the `` collinear effective theory '' for brevity . below the scale @xmath14 and above @xmath15",
    ", we integrate out all the collinear modes , and there remain only soft modes in the final soft effective theory .",
    "this actually corresponds to the large - energy effective theory suggested by dugan and grinstein @xcite , in which there are only soft modes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , they show that at each stage of the effective theories , the infrared behavior of the full theory is correctly reproduced by including the effects of collinear gluons .",
    "therefore heavy - light currents in the full theory finally can be matched onto operators in the effective theories , their wilson coefficients are calculable and the renormalization group equation can be solved .",
    "if we consider exclusive @xmath4 decays via heavy - light currents in the scheme of effective theories , it is sufficient to consider the collinear effective theory between the scale @xmath0 and @xmath14 and integrate out all the degrees of freedom above some scale @xmath12 . at this scale ,",
    "we describe a heavy quark in terms of hqet , and treat an energetic light quark in the collinear effective theory .",
    "this limit corresponds to @xmath16 with @xmath17 fixed .",
    "we can calculate the wilson coefficients of various operators in the effective theory by matching to the full theory and can obtain anomalous dimensions of various operators . in this paper",
    ", we extend further the idea of the collinear effective theory and derive the effective lagrangian to subleading order in @xmath3 and renormalize the effective theory at one loop .",
    "also we consider the correction to heavy - light currents to order @xmath3 and to leading logarithmic order in @xmath5 .    in section [ cet ] , we briefly review the collinear effective theory , and derive the effective lagrangian to order @xmath3 . we also discuss a collinear gauge invariance in the effective theory . in section [ repinvar ] ,",
    "we discuss reparameterization invariance in the collinear effective theory .",

    "let us consider a reference frame in which a light quark carries a large energy @xmath0 .",
    "if we neglect the quark mass , the only large parameter in this system is the energy @xmath0 itself .",
    "since we are interested in decays of heavy mesons to energetic light hadrons , we can conveniently choose a reference frame as the rest frame of a heavy meson , in which the energy of light hadrons is indeed large in the heavy quark limit .",
    "in this reference frame , light particles lie close on the light - cone direction @xmath13 , and we describe their dynamics using the light - cone variables @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "we choose the axis such that @xmath21 , @xmath22 with @xmath23 .    for the energetic quark , there are three distinct energy scales , with @xmath24 being large , while @xmath2 and @xmath25 are small .",
    "if we take a small parameter as @xmath26 , we can write @xmath27 since @xmath28 . therefore we have three distinct energy scales @xmath0 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , making the effective theory more complicated than the hqet .",
    "it is similar to the case of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) for quarkonium states , in which there are also three distinct scales @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath29 is the heavy quark mass and @xmath32 is the typical velocity of a quark inside a quarkonium @xcite",
    ". the collinear quark can emit either a soft gluon with momentum @xmath33 or a collinear gluon with @xmath34 to the large momentum direction and can still be on its mass shell .",
    "due to the infrared sensitivity with collinear loop momentum , the effective theory is more complicated , and the relevant scales must be treated separately to obtain a consistent power counting method . in the collinear",
    "effective theory , the power counting in @xmath11 is troublesome , but the expansion in the small parameter @xmath3 offers a consistent power counting and there is no mixing of operators with different powers of @xmath3 .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in section v.    the lagrangian in the collinear effective theory can be obtained from the full qcd lagrangian at tree level by expanding it in powers of @xmath3 .",
    "the full qcd lagrangian for massless quarks and gluons is given by @xmath35 where the covariant derivative is @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the gluon field strength tensor .",
    "we remove large momenta from the lagrangian , similar to the method employed in the hqet .",
    "the quark momentum is split as @xmath38 the large part of the quark momentum @xmath39 and @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath40 , will be removed by defining a new field as @xmath41 a label @xmath42 in @xmath43 refers to only the components @xmath44 and @xmath2 .",
    "the derivative @xmath45 on the field @xmath43 gives @xmath46 contributions .",

    "<S> we consider a collinear effective theory of highly energetic quarks with energy @xmath0 , interacting with collinear and soft gluons by integrating out collinear degrees of freedom to subleading order . </S>",
    "<S> the collinear effective theory offers a systematic expansion in power series of a small parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the transverse momentum of a collinear particle . </S>",
    "<S> we construct the effective lagrangian to first order in @xmath3 , and discuss its features including additional symmetries such as collinear gauge invariance and reparameterization invariance . </S>",
    "<S> heavy - light currents can be matched from the full theory onto the operators in the collinear effective theory at one loop and to order @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain heavy - light current operators in the effective theory , calculate their wilson coefficients at this order , and the renormalization group equations for the wilson coefficients are solved . as an application , we calculate the form factors for decays of @xmath4 mesons to light energetic mesons to order @xmath3 and at leading - logarithmic order in @xmath5 . </S>"
