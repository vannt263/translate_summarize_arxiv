    "the galaxies in the local universe appear to be classifiable into two broad types : late - type galaxies , with spiral arms , disk - dominated morphologies , ongoing star formation , and blue optical colours ; and early - type galaxies , with elliptical or bulge - dominated morphologies , old stellar populations , and red colours .",
    "many studies have observed a strong correlation between morphology and environment ( _ i.e. _ , the morphology  density relation ) , with spiral galaxies tending to be located in low - density environments and elliptical galaxies in more dense environments ( e.g. , dressler 1980 , postman & geller 1984 , norberg et al .",

    "2007 , ball et al . 2008 ) .",
    "other bimodal galaxy properties have also been found to be strongly correlated with the environment : blue galaxies with significant star formation activity tend to reside in underdense environments , while galaxies with red colours and low star formation rates tend to reside in overdense environments ( e.g. , lewis et al .",

    "haloes assemble hierarchically , such that smaller haloes merge to form larger and more massive haloes in dense environments ( mo & white 1996 , sheth & tormen 2002 ) . according to the current paradigm of galaxy formation , galaxies form within haloes , due to the cooling of hot gas .",
    "halos and galaxies evolve simultaneously , and the evolution of a galaxy is affected by its host halo .",
    "if the halo is accreted by a larger halo , the galaxy will be affected by it as well : for example , the galaxy s diffuse hot gas reservoir may be stripped , removing its fuel for future star formation ( e.g. , larson , tinsley & caldwell 1980 ; balogh , navarro & morris 2000 ; weinmann et al .",
    "2006 ; van den bosch et al .",
    "galaxies may also experience major mergers , which transform late - type galaxies into early - type galaxies with a central bulge component ( e.g. , driver et al .",
    "2006 , drory & fisher 2007 ) .",
    "mergers drive gas towards the center , where it can trigger a burst of star formation and fuel the central black hole , the feedback from which can heat the remaining gas and eventually quench star formation ( e.g. , mihos & hernquist 1996 , wild et al . 2007 , pasquali et al .",
    "2008 , schawinski et al .",
    "2009a ) . in this general picture of galaxy formation and evolution",
    ", it is expected that galaxies morphological and star formation properties are differently correlated with the environment .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to shed light on some of these galaxy evolution processes by disentangling the environmental correlations of morphology and colour .",
    "we use mark statistics of galaxy clustering , which are sensitive to environmental correlations ( e.g. , skibba et al .",
    "2006 ) , with catalogues of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) to explore the respective roles of morphology and colour in galaxy evolution .",
    "we characterise morphologies using classifications from the galaxy zoo project ( as described in section  [ gzmorph ] ) .",
    "this paper is complementary to the work by bamford et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who studied the environmental dependence of morphology and colour with similar catalogues , using projected galaxy density within an adaptive radius and distance to the centre of the nearest galaxy group to characterize the environment .",
    "bamford et al . used these environmental indicators to obtain information about the fractions of galaxy morphologies and colours as an explicit function of environment .",
    "however , for their local density estimator , a single density corresponds to a range of scales , while the use of the distance to the nearest group implicitly assumes group - specific environmental mechanisms , in addition to the assumptions of the group - finding algorithm .",
    "our mark clustering statistics yield complementary information , quantifying environmental trends as an explicit function of scale .",
    "this paper and bamford et al . provide very different statistical descriptions of the same dataset .",
    "in addition , bamford et al . explored the environmental dependence of morphology and colour at fixed stellar mass , while we explore the environmental dependence of morphology at fixed colour , and vice versa .",
    "both papers also shed light on the substantial populations of ` unconventional ' galaxies : red spirals and blue early - types .",
    "finally , both the mark correlation functions presented here and the correlations with group mass and luminosity in bamford et al . can be compared to halo occupation models and semi - analytic models in a straightforward manner .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the galaxy zoo data and our volume - limited catalogues .",
    "we introduce mark clustering statistics , and in particular , the marked correlation function , in section  [ markstats ] . in section  [ morphmarks ] ,",
    "we present marked correlation functions using galaxy zoo morphology likelihoods as marks , which show the environmental dependence of spiral and early - type morphologies , and of merging and interacting galaxies .",
    "next , we disentangle the environmental dependence of morphology and colour in section  [ morphcolour ] , by analyzing morphology - environment correlations at fixed colour and colour - environment correlations at fixed morphology .",
    "we focus on the populations of red spiral galaxies and blue early - type galaxies in section  [ redspirals ] , and our results allow us to explain their roles in galaxy evolution .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "the catalogues used in this paper are constructed from the sdss data release 6 ( dr6 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "we consider only the galaxies in the main galaxy sample , extended objects with @xmath1 ( strauss et al .",
    "we also only use galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "this raises the issue of fiber collisions , where the thickness of the spectroscopic fibers means that galaxies closer than 55 \" on the sky will be missing spectra and redshifts , and hence , absolute magnitudes .",
    "this fiber - collision constraint is partly alleviated by the fact that neighbouring plates have overlap regions , but it still results in @xmath2 of targeted galaxies not having a measured redshift .",
    "fiber collisions weakly affect correlation functions at scales of @xmath3 in redshift - space , and mark correlation functions as well , if galaxy spectra are required for accurate marks ( skibba et al .",
    "2006 ) . however , we measure only _ projected _ marked correlation functions , in which any effects of fiber collisions cancel out ( see eq .  [ markedwp ] in section  [ markstats ] ) .",
    "in addition , the fiber assignments were based solely on target positions , and in cases where multiple targets could only have a single fiber assigned , the target selected to be observed was chosen randomly  hence independently of galaxy properties . for the projected correlation functions",
    "@xmath4 , we do not observe any downturn at small scales , which one might expect , due to the higher fraction of missing galaxies .",
    "in addition , we have performed tests with similar catalogs with different minimum redshifts , and have also compared some measurements to those of skibba & sheth ( 2008 ) , in which fiber - collided galaxies were included and were given the redshift of their nearest neighbour ; in both cases , the correlation functions were consistent at small scales .",
    "we conclude that the effects of fiber collisions are negligible for both the projected correlation functions and marked projected correlation functions .",
    "we use petrosian magnitudes for the galaxy luminosities and colours .",
    "absolute magnitudes are determined using ` kcorrect v4_1_4 ` ( blanton & roweis 2007 ) and are @xmath5-corrected and corrected for passive evolution to @xmath6 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to volume - limited samples , described in section  [ volltd ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a spatially flat cosmology with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we write the hubble constant as @xmath9  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 .",
    "although galaxy colours are directly measurable , their morphologies are not .",
    "a variety of galaxy properties , such as those that quantify the radial light profile of a galaxy , have been used as proxies for galaxy morphologies ( e.g. , blanton et al . 2005 , van den bosch et al .",
    "automated methods for classifying galaxies using more structural information have also been recently developed ( e.g. , conselice 2006 , park et al .",
    "however , none of these techniques can yet provide a direct equivalent of traditional visual morphology .",
    "studies such as lahav et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and ball et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have attempted to reproduce visual morphologies with artificial neural networks . however , their classifications rely heavily on luminosity and colour information , whereas true visual morphology is determined without direct reference to these quantities .",
    "the galaxy zoo project was born out of a need for reliable , visual morphologies for a large sample of sdss galaxies .",
    "our approach was to enlist the public s help to visually classify the morphologies of nearly one million galaxies in sdss dr6 ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "further details of the galaxy zoo project , including its motivation , design , and the initial stages of the data reduction , are given in lintott et al .",
    "we use morphological type likelihoods estimated from the galaxy zoo classifications ( bamford et al .",
    "2009 ) throughout this paper .",
    "the morphologies utilized here are derived from classifications by over 80,000 members of the international public as part of the galaxy zoo project .",
    "this project is described in detail by lintott et al .",
    "briefly , each galaxy received many , independent morphological classifications , each by a different user .",
    "the four possible classifications were labeled as ` elliptical ' , ` spiral ' , ` do nt know ' , and ` merger ' .",
    "the ` elliptical ' class , in addition to containing galaxies with elliptical morphology , also contains the majority of s0 galaxies ( bamford et al .",
    "the merger class mainly comprises interacting pairs , generally with tidal features .",
    "the spiral classification was subdivided into ` clockwise ' , ` anti - clockwise ' , and ` edge - on / unsure ' , referring to the direction and orientation of the spiral arms .",
    "the median number of classifications per object is 34 , with 98 per cent of our sample having at least 20 classifications each .",
    "these classifications were processed into raw ` likelihoods ' for a galaxy being of a given morphological type , directly from the proportion of classifications for each type .",
    "the raw galaxy zoo dataset is affected by two redshift - dependent biases .",
    "the first is the usual selection bias , due to the apparent magnitude and angular size selection limits of the parent sdss main galaxy sample . in this paper",
    "we avoid the issue of selection bias by considering only volume - limited samples .",
    "the second effect is classification bias : identical galaxies are more likely to be classified as early - type with increasing redshift , due to signal - to - noise and resolution effects .",
    "bamford et al . ( 2009 ) have quantified the classification bias as a function of galaxy luminosity , size and redshift , which they then use to statistically correct the galaxy zoo data .",
    "note that absolutely no reference was made to the environment of the galaxies at any stage of this classification bias correction . throughout this paper",
    "we utilize the de - biased type likelihoods , which we denote @xmath11 and @xmath12 for spiral and early - type likelihoods , respectively .",
    "we perform our analysis on a volume - limited large - scale structure sample .",
    "our catalogue has limits @xmath13 , @xmath14 , consisting of 99924 galaxies , with mean number density @xmath15 .",
    "the superscript of 0.1 refers to the fact that all absolute magnitudes have been @xmath5-corrected and evolution - corrected to @xmath6 ; henceforth , we omit the superscript .",
    "this luminosity threshold approximately corresponds to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the schechter function break in the @xmath18-band luminosity function ( blanton et al .",
    "it also corresponds to an approximate halo mass threshold of @xmath19 ( skibba & sheth 2009 ) .",
    "we have performed the same analysis with a more luminous volume - limited catalogue , with @xmath20 , and have obtained results qualitatively similar to those presented in sections  [ morphmarks]-[redspirals ] .",
    "there are several ` false pairs ' of objects in the sdss  large objects with more than one",
    "i d associated with them .",
    "this results in extra close pairs being counted .",
    "we avoid these objects by calculating their angular separation , and then if the distance is less than either of their petrosian radii , we exclude the smaller ` false ' object .",
    "there were only a handful of such objects in our volume - limited catalogues .",
    "most of our analysis is focused on spiral and elliptical galaxies . to avoid ` contamination ' by other galaxies , we excluded galaxies with high merger or ` do nt know ' likelihoods , with @xmath21 or @xmath22 per cent or with @xmath23 per cent in the measurements , except when stated otherwise .",
    "these are conservative cuts , and they reduce the sample size of the catalogues by @xmath24 per cent .    for the measured correlation functions and jack - knife errors , which require random catalogues and jack - knife sub - catalogues , we use the hierarchical pixel scheme sdsspix , which characterizes the survey geometry , including edges and holes from missing fields and areas near bright stars .",
    "this same scheme has been used for other clustering analyses ( scranton et al .",
    "2005 , hansen et al .",
    "2007 ) and for lensing analyses ( sheldon et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we use the scranton et al . `",
    "jack_random_polygon ` with window files from sdss dr5 ( adelman - mccarthy et al . 2007 ) , which reduces the sample size by an additional @xmath25 per cent , to a final size of 72135 galaxies .",
    "for the random catalogues , we used at least ten times as many random points as in the data , and for each of the error calculations , we used thirty jack - knife sub - catalogues .",
    "the jack - knife errors of our marked projected correlation functions tend to be larger than the poisson errors , even at small scales .",
    "we note that norberg et al .",
    "( 2008 ) has recently shown that the jack - knife method does not recover the scale dependence of errors of the unmarked correlation function , often overestimating the errors at small scales , and the results are sensitive to the number of sub - catalogues into which the data is split .",
    "although our uncertainty estimates are important , our primary results are not particularly sensitive to the precise value of the errors .",
    "we characterize galaxies by their properties , or ` marks ' , such as their luminosity , colour , morphological type , stellar mass , star formation rate , etc . in most galaxy clustering analyses ,",
    "a galaxy catalogue is cut into subsamples based on the mark , and the two - point clustering in the subsample is studied by treating each galaxy in it equally ( e.g. , norberg et al .",
    "2002 , madgwick et al .",
    "2003 , zehavi et al .",
    "2005 , li et al .",
    "2006 , tinker et al . 2008 ) .",
    "these studies have shown that galaxy properties are correlated with the environment , such that elliptical , luminous , and redder galaxies tend to be more strongly clustered than spiral , fainter , and bluer galaxies . for example , norberg et al .",
    "( 2002 ) divided their catalogue by luminosity and spectral type into subsamples , measured their correlation functions , and found that luminous and quiescent galaxies have larger clustering strengths .",
    "however , the galaxy marks in these studies are used to define the subsamples for the analyses , but are not considered further .",
    "this procedure is not ideal because the choice of critical threshold for dividing galaxy catalogues is somewhat arbitrary , and because throwing away the actual value of the mark represents a loss of information . in the current era of large galaxy surveys",
    ", one can now measure not only galaxy clustering as a function of their properties , but the spatial correlations of the galaxy properties themselves .",
    "we do this with ` marked statistics ' , in which we weight each galaxy by a particular mark , rather than simply count galaxies as ` ones ' and ` zeroes ' .",
    "marked clustering statistics have recently been applied to astrophysical datasets by beisbart & kerscher ( 2000 ) , gottlber et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and faltenbacher et al .",
    "marked statistics are well - suited for identifying and quantifying correlations between galaxy properties and their environments ( sheth , connolly & skibba 2005 ) .",
    "they relate traditional unmarked galaxy clustering to the clustering in which each galaxy is weighted by a particular property .",
    "marked statistics are straightforward to measure and interpret : if the weighted and unweighted clustering are significantly different at a particular scale , then the galaxy mark is correlated ( or anti - correlated ) with the environment at that scale , and the degree to which they are different quantifies the strength of the correlation .",
    "in addition , issues that plague traditional clustering measurements , such as incompleteness and complicated survey geometry , do not significantly affect measurements of marked statistics , as these effects cancel out to some extent , since the weighted and unweighted measurements are usually similarly affected .",
    "finally , the halo model framework has been used to interpret the correlations of luminosity and colour marks in terms of the correlation between halo mass and environment ( skibba et al .",
    "2006 , skibba & sheth 2009 ) .",
    "we focus on morphological marks here , and although they could be similarly analyzed with the halo model , perhaps by building on these luminosity and colour mark models , that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "there are a variety of marked statistics ( beisbart & kerscher 2000 , sheth 2005 ) , but the easiest to measure and interpret is the marked two - point correlation function .",
    "the marked correlation function is simply @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the two - point correlation function , the sum over galaxy pairs separated by @xmath18 , in which all galaxies are ` weighted ' by unity .",
    "@xmath28 is the same sum over galaxy pairs separated by @xmath18 , but now each member of the pair is weighted by the ratio of its mark to the mean mark of all the galaxies in the catalogue ( e.g. , stoyan & stoyan 1994 ) .",
    "that is , for a given separation @xmath18 , @xmath27 receives a count of 1 for each galaxy pair , and @xmath28 receives a count of @xmath29 for @xmath28 .",
    "the fact that the marked statistic @xmath30 can usually be accurately estimated by the simple pair count ratio @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 are the counts of data - data pairs and @xmath33 are the weighted counts ) , without requiring a random galaxy catalogue , implies that the marked correlation function is less sensitive than the unmarked correlation function to the effects of the survey edges ( sheth , connolly & skibba 2005 ) . in effect , the denominator in eqn .",
    "[ markedxi ] divides out the contribution to the weighted correlation function which comes from the spatial contribution of the points , leaving only the contribution from the fluctuations of the marks .",
    "that is , the mark correlation function measures the clustering of the marks themselves , in @xmath18-scale environments .    in practice , in order to obviate issues involving redshift distortions , we use the projected two - point correlation function @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the galaxy separations perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight , and we integrate up to line - of - sight separations of @xmath38",
    ". we estimate @xmath39 using the landy & szalay ( 1993 ) estimator @xmath40 where @xmath32 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are the normalized counts of data - data , data - random , and random - random pairs at each separation bin .",
    "similarly , the weighted projected correlation function is measured by integrating along the line - of - sight the analogous weighted statistic @xmath43 where @xmath44 refers to a galaxy weighted by some property ( for example , @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) , and @xmath45 now refers to an object in the catalog of random points , weighted by a mark chosen randomly from its distribution .",
    "we then define the marked projected correlation function : @xmath46 which makes @xmath47 on scales larger than a few mpc .",
    "the projected correlation functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are normalized by @xmath36 , so as to be made unitless . on large scales both the real - space and projected marked correlation functions ( eqns  [ markedxi ] and [ markedwp ] ) will approach unity , because at increasing scale the correlation functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( or @xmath4 and @xmath49 ) become very small as the universe appears nearly homogeneous .",
    "the simple ratio of the weighted to the unweighted correlation function @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) approaches unity similarly , provided that there are sufficient number statistics and the catalogue s volume is sufficiently large .",
    "we explore the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology in galaxy zoo in this and the next section by measuring marked projected correlation functions of galaxies in volume - limited catalogues .    when measuring mark clustering statistics , it is important to carefully choose marks that are appropriate for one s analysis .",
    "for example , traditional morphological types of galaxies are discrete marks ( e.g. , e , s0 , sp , and irr in norberg et al . 2002 ; _ cf .",
    "_ , wolf et al .",
    "2007 , poggianti et al .",
    "continuous marks can be more useful for analyses of mark correlations , but like discrete marks , they must be measurable with sufficient precision such that contamination by measurement error is not a serious concern .",
    "a variety of continuous marks have been used to attempt to characterize the morphological or structural properties of galaxies , such as sersic index , surface brightness , @xmath52 concentration , and their combinations ( blanton et al . 2005 , christlein & zabludoff 2005 , conselice 2006 , scarlata et al .",
    "2007 , park et al .",
    "2007 , van den bosch et al .",
    "2008a , ball et al .",
    "2008 , van der wel 2008 ) .",
    "however , while such structural parameters are no doubt informative , they provide limited insight concerning the presence of a disk or spiral arms , and are thus not equivalent to traditional visual morphology ; rather , they are often more strongly related to galaxy luminosity or colour ( see discussion in bamford et al . 2009 ) .    here",
    "we use the morphological - type _ likelihoods _ estimated in the galaxy zoo ( lintott et al .",
    "2008 ; see section  [ gzmorph ] ) as marks .",
    "the likelihoods were estimated using the visual classifications of the galaxy zoo , and are corrected for classification bias ( bamford et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these probabilities reflect the certainty with which galaxy zoo classifiers were able to assign each galaxy to either of the discrete `` spiral '' or `` elliptical '' classes , rather than a continuous measure of morphology .",
    "this choice of mark thus encodes our level of knowledge concerning the morphology of each galaxy .",
    "the galaxy zoo morphologies have been shown to be reliable by comparison with datasets visually classified by professional astronomers .",
    "note that we find that galaxies which are classified as lenticulars by professional astronomers are predominantly placed in the `` elliptical '' galaxy zoo class with high likelihood , and we thus henceforth refer to this class as `` early - type '' .",
    "as estimates of visual morphology in the standard and generally accepted sense , we believe the galaxy zoo classifications to be more suitable for our analysis than the various automatic morphology proxies that have been proposed .",
    "the galaxy zoo type - likelihoods , rather than discrete types or combinations of structural properties , are a reliable choice of mark for exploring the dependence of galaxy morphology on environment .",
    "mark clustering statistics are sensitive to the distributions of the marks .",
    "we begin by presenting morphology mark distributions in figure  [ probdists ] , for the @xmath53 volume - limited catalogue .",
    "the morphology likelihoods @xmath11 and @xmath12 are required to be between 0 and 1 , and they both are somewhat peaked at the minimum and maximum values , which simply reflects the fact that there is usually good agreement between galaxy zoo classifiers on the classification of each object .",
    "the figure also clearly shows that the distributions are smoother for the likelihoods corrected for classification bias , discussed in section  [ gzmorph ] . in what follows ,",
    "we only use the de - biased type - likelihoods for our analysis .    .",
    "thick red ( solid ) and blue ( dashed ) histograms show the distributions of @xmath12 and @xmath11 , respectively , and thin magenta ( solid ) and cyan ( dashed ) histograms show the distributions of their respective uncorrected raw probabilities , prior to the corrections for classification bias . ]",
    "now we present our morphology mark correlation functions for @xmath53 in figure  [ mcf195 ] . at projected separations of @xmath54 ,",
    "the mark correlations of @xmath12 are significantly above unity , indicating that it is correlated with the environment at these scales ; that is , early - types tend to be located in denser environments . in contrast ,",
    "the mark correlations of @xmath11 are significantly below unity , indicating that it is anti - correlated with the environment  that is , spirals tend to be located in underdense environments .",
    "the scale - dependence of the mark correlations is remarkably smooth , monotonically increasing or decreasing towards unity at large scales .",
    "the smoothness of these measurements , with no spikes or bumps , is partly due to the large sample size , but it also indicates that the marks have very little noise .",
    "this is impressive in itself .",
    "morphological classifications are often very uncertain , but the likelihoods from a large number of classifiers , with robust corrections for ` classification bias ' , appear to be sufficiently precise to yield clear environmental correlations .    .",
    "red ( filled ) and blue ( open ) points show the measurements for the @xmath12 and @xmath11 marks , with jack - knife error bars .",
    "]    the mark correlation functions are a useful tool to show the environmental dependence of morphology , both of pairs of galaxies within a single dark matter halo ( on small scales , @xmath55 ) , and of pairs in separate haloes ( on large scales ) .",
    "in contrast , most other studies of morphology and environment have focused on the surface density within one particular scale ( e.g. , @xmath56 ) or have used the projected distance or surface density out to the @xmath57 nearest neighbour , which mixes different scales together . in figure",
    "[ mcf195 ] , a transition appears to occur in the @xmath12 marked correlation function at @xmath58 , at the scale of the transition from the ` one - halo ' to the ` two - halo ' term . at scales",
    "much larger than the size of a typical halo , the scale dependence of marked statistics is simply related to the shape of the linear theory power spectrum ( sheth 2005 ) .",
    "the large - scale marked correlation functions are related to morphology dependent galaxy bias .",
    "the stellar masses of galaxies are correlated with their morphologies and with the environment ( e.g. , balogh et al .",
    "2001 , bamford et al . 2009 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that our observed correlation between morphology and environment is simply due to the environmental dependence of stellar mass . in order to test this",
    ", we use stellar masses estimated from luminosity and colour , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( baldry et al .",
    "2006 ) , and measure the morphology mark correlation functions at fixed stellar mass .",
    "the stellar masses have uncertainties of @xmath61 dex .",
    "we use stellar mass intervals of 0.3 dex : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "these subsamples contain 26037 , 22581 , and 9791 galaxies , respectively .",
    "the resulting clustering measurements are shown in figure  [ mcf195mstar ] .",
    "the environmental correlations remain very strong , and for the lowest mass interval , the strength of the correlation is not reduced at all .",
    "this is similar to the result obtained by bamford et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , that the environmental dependence of the early - type fraction is strong at fixed stellar mass , especially for low - mass galaxies .",
    "even for the most massive galaxies , we find that the environmental correlation is significant out to a few @xmath65 .",
    "the figure shows the result for the @xmath12 mark ; the result is approximately the same for @xmath11 : the correlation between morphology and environment remains strong even at fixed mass .",
    "therefore , a galaxy of a given stellar mass will be more likely to be an early - type ( and less likely to be a spiral ) in a dense environment compared to a galaxy of the same mass in an underdense environment .",
    "importantly , our stellar masses are estimated from luminosity and colour , both of which are correlated with morphology and the environment ( e.g. , blanton et al . 2005 , park et al .",
    "in addition , the environmental dependence of stellar mass , as characterized by mark correlations , can be entirely described by the combined environmental dependence of luminosity and colour ( skibba & sheth , in prep . ) .",
    "it has long been known that the morphologies and colours of galaxies are closely related ( e.g. , hubble 1936 , de vaucouleurs 1961 , strateva et al .",
    "2001 ) , and we attempt to disentangle the environmental correlations of these properties in section  [ morphcolour ] .     mark correlation functions ( lower panel ) for @xmath53 , for stellar mass intervals : @xmath62 ( triangles ) , @xmath63 ( filled squares ) , and @xmath64 ( open squares ) .",
    "black circles show result for full catalogue ( repeated from fig .",

    "we show the measurement of the @xmath21 mark correlation function in figure  [ pmergplot ] , now with no cuts on the morphological type - likelihoods .",
    "@xmath21 quantifies the likelihood with which a galaxy is classified as undergoing an interaction or merger , usually with indications of tidal distortions or tails ; heavily distorted objects may be more likely to be classified with a high @xmath67 ( ` do nt know ' ) .",

    "their measurement is for highly star - forming galaxies _ only _ , with strong emission lines ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , [ o iii ] , [ n ii ] , with agn excluded ) , which is why there is no large - scale trend . the extinction - corrected @xmath83 mark correlation function also displays similar behaviour .",
    "this result is consistent with the picture that mergers and interactions between galaxies can drive gas into their central regions , triggering bursts of star formation . in a thorough investigation of merging and interacting galaxies in galaxy zoo , darg et al .",
    "( 2009a ) have similarly found that the specific sfrs are about twice as high in star - forming merging galaxies than in star - forming control galaxies .",

    "( 2009 ) , who find a similar small - scale enhancement of star formation at @xmath84 , also using visually classified morphologies , with sfrs estimated from uv and ir luminosity .",
    "the correlation between @xmath21 and the environment is not unexpected : mergers and interactions are relatively common in groups and clusters , and rare in underdense environments .",
    "it is interesting that the mark correlations are significant out to @xmath85 ( the maximum separation for the bin centered on @xmath86 ) , which is near the virial radius of the minimum halo mass associated with the luminosity threshold of the galaxy catalog , estimated from halo occupation modeling ( see skibba & sheth 2009 ) .",
    "this suggests that much of the signal is due to galaxy pairs interacting and influencing each other in the central regions of dark matter haloes with masses above this threshold .",
    "however , this scale should be interpreted with caution , because the effects of galaxy mergers and interactions on morphologies and star formation are expected to be important on much smaller scales ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "our measurements do not imply that these effects persist out to larger scales : for example , two galaxies @xmath88 and @xmath89 with a separation @xmath90 and a relatively large mark product @xmath91 might not be merging with each other .",
    "rather , they may both be located in a small - scale environment in which the occurrence of mergers is relatively likely .",
    "the scale of the upturn in the mark correlation function has a simple physical explanation : mergers tend to occupy slightly denser environments than average , often in galaxy groups ( mcintosh et al .",
    "2008 , darg et al .",
    "galaxy pairs in groups are often found at projected separations of @xmath92 , and some of them may have recently experienced a merger or interaction .",
    "galaxy mergers also occur in clusters , where galaxies often have larger projected separations , but the fraction of galaxies that are merging is relatively low .",
    "we also note that , our result in figure  [ pmergplot ] , while suggestive , does not imply a _ necessary _ connection between the processes of merging and star formation : the merging / interacting and starbursting galaxy pairs are not necessarily the same , and even if they are , we can not by these methods establish a causal connection . because the mark distributions are so different and because of the uncertainties involved , we can not draw stronger conclusions at this time .",
    "note that the galaxy zoo merger / interaction likelihoods have other potential uses as well .",
    "for example , they could be used to estimate merger rates or fractions , as has been done with other morphological classifications ( e.g. , de propris et al .",
    "2007 , lotz et al . 2008 ) .",
    "galaxy close pair counts have been used extensively for this purpose , but @xmath21 _ weighted _ pair counts could also contribute to such studies , or could be used as tests for other methods .",
    "we can define the following as the fraction of galaxies within a distance @xmath93 that show signs of merging ( e.g. , distortions or tidal tails that indicate a significant gravitational interaction ) : @xmath94 where the denominator is the close pair fraction , ( see masjedi et al .",
    "2006 , bell et al . 2006 ) and @xmath95 is the _ real - space _ @xmath21 weighted correlation function , normalized by the mean mark @xmath96 ( which is approximately 0.027 for the catalogue used for fig .",

    "therefore , _ the correlations between morphology and environment are extremely weak at fixed colour _ : blue galaxies have no morphology - environment correlation , and for red galaxies , only a weak residual correlation at small scales remains .",
    "this implies that much of the correlation between morphology and environment is explained by that of colour and environment , and the remaining environmental dependence occurs only on scales smaller than the diameter of a typical dark matter halo .",

    "( note that colour gradients are much stronger than luminosity gradients ( hansen et al .",
    "2007 ) ; since galaxy stellar masses are well - described by their luminosities and colours ( bell et al .",
    "2003 ) , this suggests that , at least for some subpopulations of galaxies , the environmental dependence of their stellar populations is such that the observed stellar mass segregation within groups ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2008b ) manifests itself observationally merely as colour segregation . )",
    "such gradients as a function of halo - centric or group - centric distance result in slightly stronger mark correlations , but only at small scales ( skibba 2009 ) .",
    "the fact that the residual correlation in figure  [ morphmcfredblu ] occurs only at scales of @xmath105 , that is , predominantly within dark matter haloes , suggests that in haloes of given mass , red early - types are more strongly clustered than the whole red galaxy population .",
    "it is possible that this correlation is related to stellar mass segregation in haloes , because although bamford et al .",
    "( 2009 ) observe a similar small - scale morphology - environment correlation at fixed stellar mass , it is relatively weak .",
    "however , if the morphology gradient were mostly due to stellar mass segregation , then at fixed stellar mass , most of the morphology - environment correlation should disappear at small scales , but this is clearly not the case ( see lower panel of figure  [ mcf195mstar ] ) .    in any case",
    ", we interpret the residual mark correlation in figure  [ morphmcfredblu ] such that , haloes may host both red early - types ( red galaxies with high @xmath12 ) and red spirals ( red galaxies with low @xmath12 ) , but the latter tend to be located further from the halo center and are more likely to be ` satellite ' galaxies .",
    "the galaxy pairs at small separations consist mostly of central - satellite pairs , and therefore red satellites closer to a red central galaxy in a given halo are more likely to be early - types than red satellites further away . if there were a significant halo mass dependence of morphology at fixed colour , then the marked correlations would have to be statistically significant ( i.e. , inconsistent with @xmath106 ) on larger scales  scales at which the clustering statistics are dominated by the contribution from pairs in separate haloes  but we do not observe such a correlation in figure  [ morphmcfredblu ] . in the halo model , massive dark matter haloes are more strongly clustered than less massive haloes ( e.g. , mo & white 1996 ) ; when large - scale galaxy clustering depends on a galaxy property , indicated by significant large - scale marked correlations , this implies that the property , at least for central galaxies , is correlated with halo mass ( sheth 2005 , skibba et al .",
    "2006 , skibba & sheth 2009 ) , but this is not the case here , for morphology at fixed colour .",
    "it follows from this argument that galaxy morphologies depend more on colour and halo - centric distance than on halo mass , so at fixed ( red ) colours , we expect a morphology gradient within haloes .",
    "for example , we expect that @xmath107 is not constant for galaxies with red @xmath98 , which is a prediction that can be tested with satellite galaxies in group catalogues .",
    "we have also observed a somewhat similar @xmath12 correlation for red galaxies in a more luminous catalogue , and hence for galaxies in more massive haloes , so it is possible that the strength of this gradient is approximately independent of halo mass ( for haloes with @xmath108 ) , but our results are not conclusive on this point .",
    "if this is the case , then it would imply that the transformation of red spiral satellite galaxies into red lenticular and elliptical galaxies occurs similarly in all environments .",
    "on the other hand , if the transformation mechanisms that change these galaxies morphologies , such as ram - pressure stripping , galaxy merging and tidal ` harassment ' , depend on halo mass , then they may be more ( or less ) efficient in more massive haloes , resulting in a different morphology gradient in haloes of different mass .",
    "we have also performed similar measurements with a stricter colour - magnitude cut , using colour _ likelihoods _ , analogous to the morphology likelihoods .",
    "in particular , we use the bimodal @xmath98 colour distribution as a function of @xmath18-band luminosity : the red sequence and its rms , the blue sequence and its rms , and the blue fraction , as a function of luminosity ( skibba & sheth 2009 ) . with this information",

    "when we use the stricter cuts of @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( open points in fig .",
    "[ morphmcfredblu ] ) , the result is the same : at fixed colour , there is almost no morphology - environment correlation .",

    "note that the distributions of morphology likelihoods are different for red and blue galaxies .",
    "since mark clustering statistics are sensitive to the distributions of the marks , it is possible that the weakening of the environmental correlations in figure  [ morphmcfredblu ] is simply due to differences between the distributions .",

    "the fact that we see strong mark correlations out to large - scale separations in figure  [ colourmcfellspi ] , in contrast with figure  [ morphmcfredblu ] , implies that at fixed morphology , galaxy colours are correlated with the environment : at a given morphology likelihood , galaxies tend to be redder in more massive systems ( e.g. , clusters ) than in less massive systems ( e.g. , groups ) .",
    "we have also measured colour mark correlation functions at fixed morphology _ and _ luminosity , and have found significant residual environmental trends .",

    "error bars are shown only for the fainter two subsamples , and the points are connected , for clarity . ]    therefore , _ at fixed morphology and luminosity , a relatively strong correlation between colour and environment remains .",

    "it is worth noting that , as pointed out by quintero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , it is possible in principle that the strong colour - environment correlation and extremely weak morphology - environment correlation is due to the measurement errors of the marks . in particular , it is possible that , ( i ) the errors of the morphology likelihoods are much larger than those of the colours , and in an extreme case , so large that they wash out some of the environmental correlations ; and ( ii ) the errors themselves could be correlated with each other and with the environment .",
    "however , firstly , our error analyses show that the uncertainties in the morphology mark correlation functions are only slightly larger than those of the colour mark correlation functions .",
    "secondly , the galaxy zoo morphology classifications were done independently of the environment and were tested with black and white images ( lintott et al .",
    "the corrections for classification bias ( bamford et al . 2009 ) also appear to be robust for the redshifts to which our volume - limited catalogue is restricted .",
    "we conclude that the errors of the morphologies and colours can have only a minimal impact on our correlation function measurements , and they do not affect our results .",

    "firstly , by comparing the red and blue circle points to the red and blue points in figure  [ mcf195 ] , the environmental correlations for the @xmath125 and @xmath126 marks are clearly magnified , due to the combined environmental dependence of both morphology and colour .",
    "that is , red early - types tend to be located in very dense environments , while blue spirals tend to reside in very underdense environments .",
    "in addition , on scales of @xmath105 , the environmental dependence of the red early - types appears to be stronger than the environmental anti - correlations of the blue spirals : for example , @xmath127 ( red circles ) rises to @xmath128 at @xmath129 ( _ i.e. _ , the weighted correlation function is 2.5 times stronger than the unweighted correlation function ) , while @xmath130 drops only to @xmath131 ( _ i.e. _ , the weighted correlation function is only 2 times weaker than the unweighted correlation function ) .",
    "this may be an indication that the vast majority of red early - types are central galaxies .",
    "secondly , for the @xmath132 and @xmath133 marks , one might expect that the mark signal would be weak or nonexistent , as these are combining opposite environmental correlations .",
    "nonetheless , the mark correlations are fairly strong and significant out to large scales , and their direction suggests that environmental dependence of colour is stronger than that of morphology . in principle , this could be due to the fact the @xmath109 distribution is different from @xmath12 ( which is equivalent to @xmath66 here ) .",
    "however , even after accounting for the different distributions ( in the appendix ) , we still find that galaxies with high @xmath109 and @xmath11 tend to reside in denser environments than average , where the environment is measured between @xmath134 .",
    "there is a downturn in the measurement for the @xmath132 mark at small scales ( @xmath135 ) , which may be due to the relatively high satellite fraction of red spirals ( discussed in the next section ) , resulting in a suppressed central - satellite term , and also may be partly due to morphology gradients within haloes , if they are stronger than colour gradients ( _ i.e. _ , if @xmath11 decreases more rapidly than @xmath109 increases at small halo - centric radii ) .",
    "the behaviour of the mark correlation function also demonstrates that the morphology likelihoods and colour likelihoods contain independent information , and that the former is not derivative of the latter .    in any case",
    ", the main conclusion from figure  [ predpspiusw ] is that redder , more spiral structured galaxies tend to be located in denser environments than average , and red early - types are even more strongly correlated with the environment .",
    "while red early - type galaxies and blue late - type galaxies are abundant and well - known , we now turn to the less understood population of red spiral galaxies .",

    "we showed in section  [ morphcolour ] that at fixed colour the morphology - environment correlation is relatively weak , while at fixed morphology some of the colour - environment correlation remains .",

    "these objects appear red due to low star formation rates and their residual star formation being highly extincted , and are particularly prevalent at intermediate densities .",
    "we will argue that a large fraction of the red spiral galaxies in the galaxy zoo are indeed satellite galaxies ; their emission line statistics are currently being investigated .",
    "figure  [ mcf195 ] showed that spiral galaxies tend to reside in underdense environments , or low - mass dark matter haloes , while figure  [ colourmcfellspi ] showed that red galaxies tend to reside in overdense environments , or massive haloes .",

    "this is consistent with our interpretation of the weak residual morphology - environment correlation of red galaxies in figure  [ morphmcfredblu ] .",
    "we test this with a halo occupation model of galaxy clustering , ( e.g. , zehavi et al .",
    "2005 , zheng et al .",
    "2007 ) , in which the halo occupation distribution of central and satellite galaxies depends on halo mass and the luminosity threshold . in figure  [ redspi ] , we show the result of such a model , using mean halo occupation functions described in appendix a2 of skibba & sheth ( 2008 ) . in simple halo occupation models , for galaxies more luminous than some threshold ( @xmath53 in this case ) , corresponding to an approximate halo mass threshold ( @xmath140 )",
    ", haloes are occupied by a single central galaxy and @xmath141 satellite galaxies , where @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 increases with @xmath145 . in practice",
    ", we account for the fact that there is significant scatter in the relation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass , and that the satellite halo occupation function drops off more rapidly than a power - law at low masses just above @xmath146 .",
    "the satellite galaxy fraction is then @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the halo mass function .",
    "the range of models that approximately fit the measurement ( with @xmath149 ) have a satellite fraction of @xmath150 .",
    "this is fifty per cent larger than the satellite fraction of all galaxies with @xmath53 , @xmath151 .",
    "there are two significant differences between the models that fit the correlation function of red spirals in the figure and the fiducial model for all galaxies brighter than the luminosity threshold .",
    "firstly , and most importantly , the halo mass threshold @xmath146 for red spirals is about 0.1 - 0.2 dex larger than that of the whole population , while the parameter @xmath152 , which characterizes the amplitude of the mean halo occupation function and approximately corresponds to the mass of a halo that hosts one satellite on average , is only @xmath153 times larger than @xmath146 , rather than the fiducial factor of @xmath154 .",
    "the slope @xmath144 of the halo occupation function is unchanged .",
    "if instead @xmath144 were much larger for red spirals , indicating more galaxies in more massive haloes , and @xmath155 were unchanged , then red spirals would be predominantly located in massive , cluster - sized haloes .",
    "however , such models are ruled out by the measurement . since @xmath155 has a lower value , the mean of the halo occupation distribution , @xmath156 , is relatively large even in lower mass haloes , indicating that the red spiral satellite galaxies are expected to reside in haloes with a wide range in mass .",
    "although red spirals have been observed in the outskirts of galaxy clusters ( hosted by high - mass haloes , with @xmath157 ) , we predict that they are located in galaxy groups as well ( hosted by less massive haloes , with masses as low as @xmath158 ) . secondly , in order to fit the suppressed correlation function at scales of @xmath105 , models in which the satellite galaxy number density profile is less concentrated ( by a factor of three ) than the dark matter profile are favored . however , this parameter is not well - constrained .",
    "we now address the possibility that our results are affected by dust reddening and galaxy inclinations .",
    "for example , a significant fraction of edge - on s0s could be mistakenly classified as spirals , or star - forming edge - on spirals could be sufficiently dusty to satisfy our colour criterion for ` red spirals ' .",
    "corrections for inclination - related effects are available in the literature ( masters et al . 2003 , shao et al .",
    "2007 , maller et al . 2008 ) , and they are not negligible . in galaxy zoo",
    "we can determine whether objects were classified as spiral due to the presence of visible spiral arms or simply due to a disky , edge - on appearance .",
    "following bamford et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we define as ` edge - on / unclear ' those objects for which the majority of classifiers could not individually discern a spiral arm direction ( @xmath159 , where cw , acw , and eu refer to clockwise , anti - clockwise , and edge - on / unclear , respectively ) .",
    "note that this is conservative , as even if a minority of classifiers can discern spiral arms in a galaxy , then it is very likely to be a spiral .    in figure  [ incltest ]",
    ", we compare the clustering of red edge - on spirals ( galaxies redder than the colour cut in eqn .",
    "[ colourcut ] , with @xmath159 , and with @xmath115 ) and of red face - on spirals ( redder than the colour cut , with @xmath160 , and with @xmath115 ) .",
    "the red edge - on spirals outnumber the red face - on ones by a factor of more than 3:1 .",
    "the red edge - on spirals appear slightly less strongly clustered than the red face - on spirals , consistent with the hypothesis that many of them are star - forming galaxies , which tend to be located in underdense environments .",
    "nonetheless , the difference between the clustering measurements is of very weak statistical significance .",
    "we have also used the apparent axis ratio ( @xmath161 ) as an observational inclination indicator , and have found that , for red spiral galaxies , it too does not depend strongly on the environment .",
    "in addition , the @xmath161 distributions of red spirals and blue spirals are similar , especially when the spiral arms are visible .",
    "these tests show that galaxy inclinations can have only a minimal effect on our results , and they do not affect our conclusions .",

    "the points have been slightly offset in @xmath162 , for clarity . ]    finally , we show the colour - magnitude diagram of red spiral galaxies compared to that of all red galaxies and all spiral galaxies in figure  [ redspicmd ] .",
    "red spirals consist of @xmath163 per cent of the total population of red galaxies and also @xmath164 per cent of the spiral galaxy population .",

    "the contours encompass colour - magnitude points with galaxy counts that are 5 per cent or more of the maximum count in the _ full _ catalogue ( which is peaked at @xmath165 , @xmath166 ) , thus showing the relative contribution of each subset of the data .",
    "the satellite galaxy mean colour - magnitude sequence of skibba & sheth ( 2009 ) is also shown ( green line ) . ]",
    "we interpreted the clustering result in figure  [ redspi ] , and in particular the suppressed small - scale correlation function of red spiral galaxies , as evidence that red spirals are often satellite galaxies . in the colour - magnitude diagram in figure  [ redspicmd ]",
    "we have also plotted the satellite galaxy mean colour - magnitude sequence of skibba & sheth ( 2009 ) and skibba ( 2009 ) , which they found to be consistent with measurements of colour mark correlation functions in the sdss , and with the satellite colours as a function of luminosity and group richness in sdss group catalogues .",
    "skibba ( 2009 ) showed that a large fraction of faint satellites are somewhat blue , and argued that many are likely still undergoing processes of star formation quenching , while the majority of brighter satellites tend to lie on the red sequence .",
    "the fact that the satellite galaxy colour sequence in the figure goes through the colour - magnitude region occupied by blue spirals at faint luminosities ( @xmath167 ) , red spirals at intermediate luminosities ( @xmath168 ) , and red early - types at bright luminosities ( @xmath169 ) , suggests that satellites tend to follow a particular evolutionary sequence .",
    "firstly , it suggests that the time - scale of the morphological transformation of these galaxies is longer than that of the quenching of their star formation , consistent with the analysis of wolf et al .",
    "secondly , it is useful to recall that while faint satellites can be found in dark matter haloes of all masses , bright satellites tend to reside only in massive haloes ( skibba et al .",
    "therefore , while red spiral satellite galaxies may be potentially found in haloes of a wide range in mass , red early - type satellites are rarer and tend to be found only in massive haloes , in the inner regions of galaxy clusters .",
    "consequently , we argue that many red spirals are satellites in groups and clusters , in a variety of environments , and were formally blue spirals whose star formation has been suppressed .",
    "this picture is consistent with the analysis of van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "in contrast , central galaxies have a bluer mean colour sequence as a function of luminosity than satellites . at a given luminosity ,",
    "central galaxies tend to be slightly bluer than satellites and tend to be in less massive haloes , although central galaxies account for the vast majority of luminous red galaxies , in more massive haloes ( skibba 2009 ) .",
    "we interpret the strong correlation between colour and environment for spiral galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ colourmcfellspi ] ) such that , most blue spirals are central galaxies in low - mass haloes ( _ i.e. _ , in less dense environments ) , while red spirals are either central galaxies in intermediate - mass haloes ( with masses up to @xmath170 , corresponding to @xmath171 ) or satellites in more massive haloes ( with masses @xmath172 , _",
    "i.e. _ , in denser environments ) . the red spiral central galaxies tend to be located in galaxy groups , because of the correlation between halo mass and group richness . following mergers with their own satellites , these central galaxies could form bulges with supermassive black holes , and transform their morphologies into lenticular and elliptical types ( the gz early - type class ) . if these groups are accreted onto clusters , the former central galaxies would be the origin of the red early - type satellites in massive haloes .",
    "this picture is consistent with the analysis of schiminovich et al .",

    "the different relations between morphology and colour and between morphology and group mass for central and satellite galaxies are currently being investigated further ( skibba et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , with the galaxy group catalogue of yang et al .",
    "we have used volume - limited galaxy catalogues from the sdss data release 6 ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 ) with data from the galaxy zoo ( lintott et al .",
    "2008 ) to study the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology and colour .",
    "the galaxy zoo project produced a large catalogue of visual morphological galaxy classifications , yielding reliable morphological type likelihoods for hundreds of thousands of galaxies .",
    "we measured projected two - point correlation functions and marked correlation functions , and we used the latter to identify and quantify the environmental correlations of morphological type likelihoods and @xmath98 colour on a wide range of scales .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    * we measured marked correlation functions using the marks @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the likelihoods of a galaxy being a spiral and early - type , respectively .",
    "these showed clear environmental trends , such that at all scales probed , spiral galaxies tend to reside in less dense environments and early - type galaxies tend to be located in overdense environments .",
    "furthermore , the scale - dependence of the mark correlations is remarkably smooth , indicating that the marks have very little noise  that is , the galaxy zoo morphological type likelihoods , which have been corrected for classification bias , are very precise .",
    "* we also measured the @xmath21 ( merger / interaction likelihood ) marked correlation function , and found that it is strongly correlated with the environment at scales up to @xmath85 .",
    "that is , galaxies on these scales have a much larger likelihood of showing evidence of mergers and interactions than average .",
    "we compared this measurement to a specific star formation rate marked correlation function measured with a catalogue with similar volume limits ( skibba , wake & sheth , in prep . ) , and showed that it too is strongly peaked at the same scale and is uncorrelated with the environment at larger scales .",
    "naturally , merging and interacting galaxies are normally studied at very small scales , at separations of @xmath173 , which is closer than we can reliably probe .",
    "however , our result shows either that the effects of galaxy interactions and bursts of star formation persist out to separations of @xmath85 or more , or that , for galaxies with neighbours on these scales , a significant fraction of their neighbours are merging and star - bursting .",
    "while we can not conclusively claim that there is a causal connection between mergers and star formation , our result is consistent with the picture that mergers and interactions between galaxies trigger star formation in them .",
    "+ studies that attempt to identify both galaxies in interacting systems frequently miss interacting objects , due to selection criteria and difficulties in determining line - of - sight separations , for example .",
    "measuring the mark correlation function , using the merging / interacting _ likelihood _ as the mark , provides a complementary way of assessing the frequency and properties of galaxy interactions , effective to larger separations , and including all interacting objects , in a statistical sense .",
    "* we have sought to disentangle the environmental dependence of morphology and colour by measuring morphology marked correlation functions at fixed colour and colour marked correlation functions at fixed morphology .",
    "we found that blue galaxies show no correlation between morphology and environment at all scales , and red galaxies are weakly correlated with the environment at small scales only ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the fact that this correlation occurs in the ` one - halo term ' , at separations smaller than the size of massive dark matter haloes , is interpreted as an indication of morphology gradients within haloes : red galaxies in the outer regions of haloes tend to be spirals while those in the inner regions tend to be early - types . because of the correlation between galaxy colours and mass - to - light ratios ( e.g. , baldry et al .",
    "2006 ) , this also implies a morphology gradient for massive galaxies .",
    "* in contrast , at fixed morphology , a relatively strong correlation between colour and environment remains .",
    "in particular , both spiral and early - type galaxies show significant colour - environment correlations out to scales of @xmath114 , and the colours of the latter have the stronger environmental dependence ( see figure  [ a4 ] ) .",
    "that is , red spiral galaxies tend to be located in denser environments than blue spirals , and red early - types tend to be located in the densest environments , at any scale the environment is measured .",
    "the fact that the morphology - environment correlation is very weak at fixed colour while the colour - environment correlation remains strong at fixed morphology implies that the morphology  density relation could be more accurately viewed as a _ colour_-density relation , which is consistent with the conclusions of other studies ( blanton et al .",
    "2005 , wolf et al .",
    "2007 , bamford et al . 2009 ) . *",
    "we used the bimodal @xmath98 colour distribution as a function of @xmath18-band luminosity ( skibba & sheth 2009 ) to estimate colour likelihoods of galaxies , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , analogous to the morphology likelihoods @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "we used these four likelihoods together as marks , and found that the marked correlation function with the @xmath132 mark is significantly above unity .",
    "that is , the opposite environmental correlations did not cancel out ; instead , the environmental dependence of colour is much stronger than that of morphology .",
    "* this result shows that galaxies that are both red and spiral tend to be located in dense environments .",
    "these red spiral galaxies are not insignificant : they are @xmath174 per cent of the galaxies in the @xmath53 volume - limited catalogue , and they account for nearly a quarter of all the spirals . we compared the correlation function of red spiral galaxies to that of all red galaxies and of spirals , and found that the clustering of red spirals is similar to that of red galaxies on large scales , but is depressed on scales of @xmath138 , in the one - halo term , indicating that they have a high satellite fraction .",
    "this is more evidence that many red spiral galaxies are satellite galaxies .",
    "skibba & sheth ( 2009 ) and skibba ( 2009 ) showed that satellite galaxies tend to follow a particular sequence on the colour - magnitude diagram , and it passes through the region of the diagram occupied by red spirals .",
    "these results suggest that satellite galaxies evolve a particular way : faint satellites are accreted as blue late - types , and then they experience ` strangulation ' , in which their hot gas reservoirs are stripped , causing their star formation to be gradually suppressed while they retain spiral morphology .",

    "the procedure is simple : if there are @xmath175 marks in a catalogue , then we generate @xmath175 random marks such that they have the required distribution .",
    "then we sort these marks and replace the original marks in the catalogue with them .",
    "we maintain the rank order of the galaxies marks ; only their distribution has changed .",

    "the morphology gradient of red galaxies on small scales is slightly stronger .",

    "this result clearly shows that red early - type galaxies are more strongly clustered than red spirals , especially within the one - halo term .",
    "the apparent opposite trend in figure  [ colourmcfellspi ] was simply due to the extremely narrow colour distribution of early - types ( _ i.e. _ , the colours were not allowed to depart significantly from the mean , so the colour marks of strongly clustered red early - types were not much larger than the colour marks of bluer early - types in less dense environments ) .",

    "the @xmath109 distribution is more strongly peaked near 0 and 1 than that of @xmath12 , simply because the colour distribution of galaxies is strongly bimodal , with an underpopulated ` green valley ' , across much of the range of luminosities ( skibba & sheth 2009 ) .",
    "since the distribution of colour likelihoods is more strongly peaked at the minimum and maximum than the distribution of morphology likelihoods , it is possible that this could artificially strengthen the environmental dependence of colour vis -  - vis that of morphology .",
    "we account for this by maintaining the rank order of @xmath109 of the galaxies in the catalogue , and giving them the same distribution as that of @xmath12 .",
