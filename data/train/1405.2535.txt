    "it can be divided into two disjoint sets , the discrete spectrum , @xmath60 , and the essential spectrum , @xmath61 , @xmath62 the discrete spectrum is formed by isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity corresponding to the energies of bound states .",

    "one can show that the essential spectrum of @xmath58 extends from @xmath63 to infinity , @xmath64 we refer to appendix  [ app1 ] for the proof that is based on the neumann bracketing and weyl s criterion @xcite .",
    "the exact form of the discrete spectrum can not be obtained without the explicit knowledge of the potential @xmath55 and without solution of the corresponding stationary equation .",
    "however , we can specify sufficient conditions for existence of discrete eigenvalues of the hamiltonian employing the variational principle .",
    "the variational minimax principle @xcite tells us that the expectation value of energy for a normalized state from the domain @xmath65 of @xmath58 is equal to or is above the ground state energy .",
    "more precisely , there holds @xmath66 here , we denoted @xmath67 the energy functional ( quadratic form ) associated with the hamiltonian @xmath58 . despite the domain @xmath68 of @xmath69 being larger than that of @xmath58 ( it consists of the states that are square integrable together with their first derivative ) , the last equality in ( [ variational ] ) holds true as the @xmath65 is dense in @xmath68 .",
    "the discrete spectrum of @xmath58 is non - empty as long as @xmath70 .",
    "a quick inspection of ( [ variational ] ) reveals the necessary condition for this to happen : the function @xmath71 has to be negative for some @xmath72 .",
