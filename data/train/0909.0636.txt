    "dry granular materials are collections of discrete , macroscopic particles that interact via dissipative and purely repulsive interactions , which are nonzero when particles are in contact and vanish otherwise .",
    "granular systems range from model systems composed of glass beads to pharmaceutical powders , to soils and geological materials .",
    "a distinguishing feature of granular materials is that they are _",
    "athermal_. since individual grains are large , thermal energy at room temperature @xmath2 is unable to displace individual grains .",
    "thus , without external driving , granular materials are static and remain trapped in a single mechanically stable ( ms ) grain packing with force and torque balance on each grain . in contrast , when external forces are applied to granular materials , these systems flow , which gives rise to grain rearrangements , fluctuations in physical quantities like shear stress and pressure , and the ability to explore configuration space .",
    "there are many driving mechanisms that generate dense flows in granular media  for example , oscillatory @xcite and continuous shear  @xcite , horizontal @xcite and vertical vibration @xcite , and gravity - driven flows @xcite .",
    "the fact that driven granular systems can achieve steady - states , explore configuration space , and experience fluctuations as in thermal systems , has prompted a number of groups to describe these flows using concepts borrowed from equilibrium statistical mechanics ( such as effective temperature ) @xcite .",
    "however , before a statistical mechanical treatment can be rigorously applied to dense granular flows , fundamental questions about the nature of configuration space should be addressed . in particular",
    ", one needs to determine how dense granular systems sample configuration space : is it uniformly sampled or are some states visited much more frequently than others ? how is the sampling of configuration space affected by the strength and type of driving and dissipation mechanisms ? in this work and a series of recent papers @xcite , we address these questions with the goal of developing a comprehensive physical picture for static and slowly driven granular matter .    in our previous studies , we focused on the statistical properties of static frictionless disk packings generated by slow compression without gravity @xcite or by gravitational deposition @xcite .",
    "we have determined that the probability distribution for mechanically stable packings is strongly peaked around the value typically quoted for the random - close packing ( rcp ) volume fraction , and explained why rcp is obtained by many compaction protocols .",
    "we have also found that the ms - packing probabilities are highly non - uniform , contrary to the edwards equal - probability assumption @xcite that is frequently used in thermodynamic descriptions of granular matter @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have found that the probabilities become more non - uniform with increasing system size  @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we further explore the statistics of granular microstates and its relevance for static and dynamic properties of granular materials .",
    "we focus on slowly sheared systems at fixed zero pressure , where the evolution can be approximated as a sequence of transitions between ms packings .",
    "one of our novel results is that slowly sheared ms packings occur as continuous _ geometrical families _ defined by the network of particle contacts .",
    "moreover , these geometrical families are not uniformly sampled during quasistatic shear flow .",
    "we focus on small systems , so that we are able enumerate nearly all ms packings and obtain accurate packing probabilities as a function of shear strain . since our results indicate the need for developing an alternative approach to the quasi - thermodynamic descriptions based on the edwards ideas , we advocate here a new master - equation framework for understanding dense granular flows .",

[ reversible and irreversible branches](b ) .",
    "these experiments , which show that slowly driven granular systems appear to explore a well - defined set of states reversibly , have prompted a number of theoretical studies aimed at describing compacting granular systems using quasi - thermodynamic approaches based on the edwards ensemble ( _ i.e. _ the assumption of equally probable microstates )  @xcite .",

    "moreover , we have demonstrated that this feature is not sensitive to the packing - generation protocol and becomes more pronounced as the system size increases .",
    "thus , we argue that the edwards equal - probability assumption is not valid and alternate theoretical approaches for slowly driven granular systems must be developed .",
    "although several alternatives have been put forward @xcite , we advocate here for a master - equation approach for the following reasons .",
    "first , quasistatic evolution of slowly driven granular systems can be approximated as a sequence of transitions between ms packings .",
    "second , since the system undergoes particle rearrangements as it transitions between ms packings , it retains little memory from one ms packing to the next , and successive ms packings are nearly statistically independent .",
    "thus , slowly driven granular systems can be approximated as a markov chain of independent transitions between ms packings and described using a master - equation approach .",
    "we have shown that the form of the microstate probability distribution can be qualitatively reproduced by combining probabilities for small subsystems .",
    "thus , we also advocate a novel ` bottom - up ' approach in which large granular systems are described as collections of nearly independent subsystems .",
    "we view this work on small quasistatically sheared ms packings as laying the groundwork for future studies that will apply the master - equation approach to quantitatively describe the statistical properties of dense granular flows .      to illustrate the importance of the above - mentioned features in capturing the irreversible and reversible branches in fig .",
