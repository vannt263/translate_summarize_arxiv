    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite parametrize the non - perturbative hadron structure in hard exclusive processes ( for comprehensive reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the measurement of gpds would provide information which is usually encoded in both the elastic form factors and the usual parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and , at the same time , it would represent a unique way to access several crucial features of the structure of the nucleon @xcite . by measuring gpds ,",
    "a test of the angular momentum sum rule of the proton @xcite could be achieved for the first time , determining the quark orbital angular momentum contribution to the proton spin @xcite .    besides , the possibility of obtaining , by means of gpds measurements , information on the structure of the proton in the impact parameter @xcite and position @xcite spaces , is being presently discussed",
    ".    therefore , relevant experimental efforts to measure gpds , by means of exclusive electron deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) off the proton , are likely to take place in the next few years @xcite .    in this scenario , it becomes urgent to produce theoretical predictions for the behavior of these quantities .",
    "several calculations have been already performed by using different descriptions of hadron structure : bag models @xcite , soliton models @xcite , light - front @xcite and bethe salpeter approaches @xcite , phenomenological estimates based on parametrizations of pdfs @xcite .",
    "besides , an impressive effort has been devoted to study the perturbative qcd evolution @xcite of gpds , and the gpds at twist three accuracy @xcite .",
    "recently , calculations have been performed also in constituent quark models ( cqm ) @xcite .",
    "the cqm has a long story of successful predictions in low energy studies of the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon . in the high energy sector , in order to compare model predictions with data taken in dis experiments , one has to evolve , according to perturbative qcd , the leading twist component of the physical structure functions obtained at the low momentum scale associated with the model , the so called `` hadronic scale '' , @xmath1 .",
    "such a procedure , already addressed in @xcite , has proven successful in describing the gross features of standard pdfs by using different cqm ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similar expectations motivated the study of gpds in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper ,",
    "a simple formalism has been proposed to calculate the quark contribution to gpds from any non relativistic or relativized model and , as an illustration , results obtained in the isgur and karl model @xcite have been evolved from @xmath1 up to dis scales , to nlo accuracy . in ref .",

    "the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , when applied in the standard forward case , has been proven to reproduce the gross features of pdfs @xcite but , in order to achieve a better agreement with data , it has to be improved . in a series of papers",
    ", it has been shown that unpolarized @xcite and polarized @xcite dis data are consistent with a low energy scenario , dominated by complex constituent quarks inside the nucleon , defined through a scheme suggested by altarelli , cabibbo , maiani and petronzio ( acmp ) @xcite , updated with modern phenomenological information .",
    "the same idea has been recently applied to demonstrate the evidence of complex objects inside the nucleon @xcite , analyzing intermediate energy data of electron scattering off the proton . besides , a similar scenario has been extensively used by other groups , starting form the concept of `` valon '' , introduced more than twenty years ago @xcite ( for recent developments , see @xcite ) .",
    "we here generalize our description of the forward case @xcite to the calculation scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to obtain more realistic predictions for the gpds and , at the same time , explore kinematical regions not accessible before .",
    "in particular , the evaluation of the sea quark contribution becomes possible , so that gpds could be calculated , in principle , in their full range of definition .",
    "such an achievement would permit to estimate the cross - sections which are relevant for actual gpds measurements , providing us with an important tool for planning future experiments .",
    "actually , as it will be shown , the proposed approach will be applied here in a non relativistic ( nr ) framework , which allows one to evaluate the gpds only for small values of the 4-momentum transfer , @xmath2 ( corresponding to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the constituent quark mass ) and small values also for the skewedness parameter , @xmath5 . the full kinematical range of definition of gpds will be studied in a followup , introducing relativity in the scheme .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "after the definition of the main quantities of interest , an impulse approximation ( ia ) convolution formula for the current quark gpds in terms of the constituent quark off - diagonal momentum distributions and constituent quark gpds is derived in the third section .",
    "then , the constituent quark gpds are built in the fourth section , according to acmp philosophy and using the double distribution ( dd s ) representation @xcite of the gpds . in the fifth section , as an illustration",
    ", results obtained by using cqm wave functions of the ik model and the obtained constituent quark gpds will be shown .",
    "conclusions will be drawn in the last section .",

    "the absorption of a high - energy virtual photon by a quark in a hadron target is followed by the emission of a particle to be later detected ; finally , the interacting quark is reabsorbed back into the recoiling hadron .",
    "if the emitted and detected particle is , for example , a real photon , the so called deeply virtual compton scattering process takes place @xcite .",

    "the @xmath5 variable in the arguments of the gpds is the so called `` skewedness '' , parametrizing the asymmetry of the process .",

    "gpds describe the amplitude for finding a quark with momentum fraction @xmath19 ( in the infinite momentum frame ) in a nucleon with momentum @xmath20 and replacing it back into the nucleon with a momentum transfer @xmath21 . besides , when the quark longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath22 of the average nucleon momentum @xmath23 is less than @xmath24 , gpds describe antiquarks ; when it is larger than @xmath5 , they describe quarks ;",

    "@xcite has been applied and a code kindly provided by a. freund has been used .",
    "the evolution clearly shows a strong enhancement of the erbl region .    we have therefore developed a scheme which provides us with the gpd @xmath0 in the full @xmath22 range",
    "this is obtained thanks to the constituent quark structure , implemented dressing the three quarks of a cqm , where initially only the dglap region of gpds was accessible .",
    "this is an important development with respect to previous work , a prerequisite for any attempt to calculate cross sections and asymmetries of related processes",
    ". the next step of our studies will be indeed to use the obtained gpds for the evaluation of cross sections which have been recently measured @xcite or will be measured soon .",
    "the estimate of cross sections is presently in progress , together with that of relativistic corrections , which will permit to enlarge the kinematical range ( basically the @xmath2 and the related @xmath5-ranges ) where our results can be applied to predict or to describe the data .",
    "for the time being , the comparison with data of our estimates is therefore not possible .    anyway , as already said , the present approach fulfills several theoretical constraints .",
    "first of all , the forward limit , eq .",
    "( [ fx ] ) , provides us with a reasonable description of quark densities ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , where the ik model together with the acmp mechanism has been applied to unpolarized dis ) .",
    "secondly , the @xmath203integral of our gpd @xmath0 turns out to be , formally and numerically , @xmath5 independent , satisfying therefore the polynomiality condition for the first moment , and providing us with a proton form factor , eq . (",
    "[ ffik ] ) , in good agreement with the data in the low-@xmath2 region which is studied here .",
    "the main theoretical drawback is the already discussed support - violation , which in any case affects our findings , in the kinematical region under investigation , by a few percents at most .",
    "another theoretical constraint which is satisfied by the present approach is the inequality : h_q(x,,^2 )  , where @xmath204 and @xmath205 , proven in @xcite . as an illustration , the validity of the above inequality",
    "is shown in fig . 8 for the @xmath176-flavor , and for @xmath206 gev@xmath123 and @xmath195 .",
    "other theoretical constraints , such as the ji sum rule @xcite , require the knowledge of the other unpolarized gpd , @xmath93 , which has not yet been calculated in the present scheme .",
    "@xmath93 arises naturally in a relativistic framework , where we plan to calculate it .",
    "in fact , a relativistic calculation will permit us to overcome the support problem and , at the same time , to enlarge the kinematical range of our predictions .",
    "once a relativistic cqm is used to predict gpds in the dglap region , the structure of the constituent quark can be introduced to access the erbl region , so that the ji sum rule and other theoretical constraints can be checked .",
    "work is being carried out in that direction .",
    "quark models have been extremely useful for understanding many features of hadrons , even in the dis regime . in previous work",
    ", a thorough analysis of both polarized and unpolarized data have shown that constituent quarks can not be considered elementary when studied with high - energy probes .",
    "the first feature found was the need for evolution , i.e. the constituent quarks at the hadronic scale have to be undressed by incorporating bremsstrahlung in order to reach the bjorken regime , but this was not all .",
    "a second feature , we found , was that the constituent quarks should be endowed with soft structure in order to approach the data .",
    "thus , the constituent quarks appear , when under scrutiny by high - energy probes , as complex systems , with a very different behavior from the current quarks of the basic theory . these features , which we found in structure functions , have also been recently discussed in form factors @xcite .    the aim of the present work has been to generalize the formalism of composite constituent quarks to study the generalized parton distributions .",
    "we here develop a formalism which expresses the hadronic gpds in terms of constituent quarks gpds by means of appropriate convolutions . in order to be able to predict experimental results",
    "we have defined a model which incorporates phenomenological features of various kinematical regimes .",
    "the model is based on radyushkin s factorization ansatz , thus our constituent quark gpds are defined in terms of the product of three functions : i ) the constituent quark structure function , where we use the acmp proposal @xcite ; ii ) radyushkin s double distributions @xcite ; iii ) constituent quark form factor as suggested in ref . @xcite .",
    "once these gpds are defined in this way , we have developed the scheme to incorporate them into any nucleon model by appropriate convolution . in order to show the type of predictions to which our proposal leads ,",
    "we have used here , as an illustration , a naive model of hadron structure , namely the ik @xcite model . however , in this latest step of our scheme , any non - relativistic ( or relativized ) model can be used to define the hadronic gpds .",
    "looking at our results , we found that the present scheme transforms a hadronic model , in whose original description only valence quarks appear , into one containing all kinds of partons ( i.e. , quarks , antiquarks and gluons ) .",
    "moreover , the starting model produces no structure in the erbl region , while after the structure of the constituent quark has been incorporated , it does .",
    "the completeness of the @xmath22-range , for the allowed @xmath2 and @xmath5 , of the present description , is a prerequisite for the calculation of cross - sections and other observables in a wide kinematical range . to this respect",
    "we recall that our findings hold for @xmath207 and @xmath37 .",
    "nevertheless , relativistic corrections , which permit to access a wider kinematical region , could be included in the approach .",
    "our aim here has been mainly the illustration of our scheme , and the inclusion of relativistic corrections , together with the use of more sophisticated models , has been postponed and will be shown elsewhere .",
    "we have reminded the reader of the calculation for the diagonal structure functions and form factors to see how in these cases , where experimental data are available , our scheme leads , even with a naive quark model , to a reasonable description of the data .",
    "thereafter , we have proceeded to calculate the gpds of physical interest to guide the preparation and analysis of future experiments .",
    "this work is the continuation of an effort to construct a scheme which describes the properties of hadrons in different kinematical and dynamical scenarios .",
    "our description can never be a substitute of quantum chromodynamics , but , before a solution of it can be found , it may serve to guide experimenters to physical processes where the theory might show interesting features , worthy of a more fundamental effort .",
    "the approach here presented can be extended to light nuclei and fragmentation functions , and work is being carried out also in these directions .",
    "we acknowledge useful correspondence with a. radyushkin and helpful discussions with g. salm .",

    "<S> an approach is proposed to calculate generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) in a constituent quark model ( cqm ) scenario , considering the constituent quarks as complex systems . </S>",
    "<S> the gpds are obtained from the wave functions of the non relativistic cqm of isgur and karl , convoluted with the gpds of the constituent quarks themselves . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are modelled by using the structure functions of the constituent quark , the double distribution representation of gpds , and a recently proposed phenomenological constituent quark form factor . </S>",
    "<S> the present approach permits to access a kinematical range corresponding to both the dglap and the erbl regions , for small values of the momentum transfer and of the skewedness parameter . in this kinematical region , </S>",
