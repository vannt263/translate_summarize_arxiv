    "noncommutative field theory has recently been attracting a lot of interests since the seminal work of seiberg and witten @xcite which showed that a particular low energy limit of string theory is described by a gauge theory on a noncommutative space defined by the commutation relation for coordinates : @xmath0=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu},\\label{nc space}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is an antisymmetric , constant matrix . the noncommutative relation ( [ nc space ] ) suggests that we should treat coordinates , or fields depending on them , as operators rather than c - numbar quantities .",
    "however , if we introduce the moyal star product @xmath2 and replace all the products between fields by this star product , we can still treat fields on a noncommutative space as c - number functions .",
    "indeed , the moyal star product is a noncommutative product and reproduces the commutation relation ( [ nc space ] ) : @xmath0_\\ast = x^\\mu\\ast x^\\nu - x^\\nu\\ast x^\\mu = i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}.\\ ] ] the conventional prescription to define the action for a field theory on the noncommutative space is to replace all the products in the action for an ordinary commutative field theory by the moyal star product ( [ ast product ] ) .",
    "quantized versions of noncommutative fied theories are also considered , and there have been a large number of papers investigating their properties such as uv / ir mixing , nonrenormalizability , noncommutative standard model , violation of lorentz invariance and the change of the causal structure ( for reviews , see , for example , @xcite and , for phenomenological aspects , see also @xcite ) .    in all such studies on noncommutative quantum field theory ( qft )",
    ", the field is quantized based on the canonical commutation relation .",
    "the basic reason for this seems that the canonical quantization gives an accurate description of nature in low energy scales where experimental data are available .",
    "however , there is no evidence to believe that the canonical quantization is the correct prescription up to high energy scales such where the noncommutative field theory would be realized . in principle , in such high energy scales , there could be an exotic quantization , other than the canonical quantization , which has the same low energy limit as that of the canonical quantization .    in this paper",
    ", we show that such a quantization does exist by the example of noncommutative scalar field theories .",
    "this new quantization , which we call _ noncommutative quantization _ , depends on the noncommutative parameter @xmath1 such that it reduces to the standard canonical quantization when @xmath3 .",
    "we shall see that green s functions and the s - matrix elements appropriate for the new quantization can be defined and calculated by means of perturbative expansions in the same way as an ordinary qft . to our surprise , they turn out to be equivalent to those of the corresponding commutative qft in all orders of perturbation .",
    "in fact , this equivalence holds even nonperturbatively , and we can find an exact map from a commutative qft to our new qft .",
    "interestingly , the new qft yeids exactly the same dynamics as those of the commutative field theory , even though the action includes noncommutative interaction terms explicitly .",
    "this is because the noncommutativity in interaction terms and the noncommutativity introduced in the quantization procedure cancel out each other .",
    "this peculiar structure of new quantization implies , for instance , that if we start from an action of a commutative field theory and quantize it by the noncommutative quantization , then we get the dynamics equivalent to a noncommutative field theory quantized by the canonical quantization .",
    "we will also investigate the structure of this cancellation of the noncommutativity in detail .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the noncommutative quantization for noncommutative scalar field theories with polynomial interaction terms . in section 3",
    ", this new quantization is applied to a free field .",
    "it is shown that operators similar to the laddar operators can be introduced , with which a ",
    "fock space \" representation is constructed .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the investigation of the noncommutative quantization for an interacting field theory .",
    "green s functions and the s - matrix are defined and their equivalence to those of the commutative qft is discussed .",
    "the structure of this equivalence is argued in some detail in section 5 .",
    "our conclusion and discussion are given in section 6 .",
    "to present our new quantizaiton for field theory models on a noncommutative space with lorentzian metric @xmath4 , we consider , for definitness , we will consider only @xmath5 dimensional real scalar field theories whose interaction terms are given by the ( noncommutative ) polynomial form : @xmath6+\\sum_{n=3}^\\infty\\frac{\\lambda_n}{n!}\\overbrace{\\phi\\ast\\phi\\ast\\cdots\\ast\\phi}^n}\\\\      & = & \\mathcal{l}_0+\\mathcal{l}_\\textrm{\\scriptsize{int}}.\\rule{0mm}{7 mm }   \\end{array }      \\label{lagrangian}\\ ] ] for example , the ordinary noncommutative @xmath7 theory is given by the case where only @xmath8 is nonzero .    to proceed further , we impose time - space commutativity condition , @xmath9 ,",
    "so that we are allowed to define the canonical momentum and the hamiltonian by the conventional formulae , canonical formalism would become somewhat complex since a interaction term of an action contains any orders of time derivatives@xcite , and then our new quantization would also become complex . for easiness , we will not consider such cases in this paper . ] : @xmath10 @xmath11,\\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath12      the new quantization , _ noncommutative quantization _ , which we will introduce bellow , can be considered as a deformation of the ordinary canonical quantization .",

    "this product gives the ordinary moyal star product when @xmath14 . in this respect",
    ", we can consider this product as a natural generalization of the moyal star product , which allows us to use this extended star product instead of the moyal star product in the interaction term of eq.([lagrangian ] ) .",
    "in addition ,",
    "we define the extended star product for functions with many variables as @xmath15}\\hspace{1.5cm}\\\\      \\times f(x_1,x_2,\\cdots , x_m)g(y_1,y_2,\\cdots , y_n ) . \\end{array}\\ ] ]    now we introduce a new quantization based on this extended star product : we promote @xmath16 and @xmath17 to operators by imposing the following _ star - deformed canonical commutation relation _",

    "in this section , we consider the noncommutative quantization for free filed : @xmath20\\;.\\ ] ] this action gives @xmath21 as equation of motion . from this equation of motion",
    ", we see that @xmath22 can be expanded in the standard form : @xmath23 however , since @xmath22 and @xmath24 satisfy eq.([nccr0 ] ) instead of the standard canonical commutation relation , @xmath25 and @xmath26 do not obey the ordinary commutation relation for ladder operators .",
    "they satisfy rather @xmath27 where @xmath28 to make this expression easier , we introduce a star product in the momentum space as follows .",

    "useful examples are @xmath38 to clarify a relation between two star product eq.([star product ] ) and eq.([star product - m ] ) , we notice the following relation is satisfied for the scalar field eq.([fourier ex ] ) : @xmath39 where the star product in lhs is given by eq.([star product ] ) and the star product in rhs is given by eq.([star product - m ] ) .",
    "that is , the star product of functions is given by the star product of fourier componets of them . from this equation",

    "this is given by the fock space , and their basis are well interpreted as energy - momentum eigenstates .",
    "is there such a representation of the fields satisfying eq.([nccr0 ] ) or equivalently eq.([nccr1 - 2 ] ) ?",
    "this turns out to be the case .",
    "that is , we can construct a  fock space \" on which the fields satisfying eq.([nccr0 ] ) are represented and we can interpret its basis as energy - momentum eigenstates .",

    "this definition is equivalent to ( [ star product x - o0 ] ) as long as one works in a free field theory .",

    "so we can define the star product between operator and arbitrary states for an interacting field theory by eq.([star product x - o ] ) . in the same way",
    ", we can define the star product between @xmath59 and @xmath60 as @xmath61 since @xmath62 , we find @xmath63      next , we calculate the feynman propagator in our framework .",

    "@xmath65 is given by @xmath66    here we introduce the _ normal - ordered star product _",
    "@xmath67 for later use . for @xmath68 ,",

    "in this section , we consider the noncommutative quantization of an interacting field theory eq.([lagrangian ] ) .",

    "in particular , this implies that we can use the interaction picture to describe the interacting field theory , that is , one can perform a perturbation expansion to calculate green s functions or s - matrix elements when the interaction term @xmath76 can be treated as perturbation .",
    "we firstly consider green s function . in the interaction picture ,",

    ", we need wick s theorem : @xmath83 where the contraction is defined as @xmath84 and , for example , @xmath85 to prove this wick s theorem , one needs to notice the following relation : @xmath86 where @xmath55 and @xmath87 are arbitrary operators which depend on coordinates .",
    "this relation results immediately from @xmath88 except for this relation ( [ star product for propagator ] ) , the proof of eq.([wick ] ) proceeds almost in the same way as the standard case . only we have to do",

    "this is the fact which we have found by the perturbation expansion in section 4.1 .    eq.([map of matrix elements ] ) also means that n - fold vacuum expectation values of field operators , i.e. , wightman functions for these theories are the same : @xmath179 it is suggestive to see this @xmath180 has the same form as the wightman function adopted in @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath180 satisfies all the axioms proposed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the axiom of the local commutativity is resulted from the star - deformed commutation relation eq.([nccr0 ] ) .",
    "that is , our new quantization provides a specific field theory , @xmath137-theory , which satisfies all the axioms in @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the discussion here to arbitrary @xmath181-theory .",
    "we can establish the correspondence between @xmath182-theory and @xmath183-theory by the aid of the map @xmath184 where @xmath110 and @xmath147 give field operators of @xmath118-theory and @xmath138-theory respectively , and @xmath185 is a momentum operator of @xmath138-theory .",
    "finally , as an example , let us apply the map ( [ theory map ] ) to the free field theory . in the case of the free field , this map gives the correspondence between creation and annihilation operators , and fock spaces of two theories .",
    "first , for creation and annihilation operators , the map ( [ theory map ] ) implies @xmath186 where @xmath187 and @xmath188 are creation and annihilation operators of the free scalar field quantized by the star - deformed commutation relation , i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath189 in section 3 , and @xmath190 and @xmath191 are those quantized by the ordinary canonical quantization , i.e. , the standard creation and annihilation operators .",
    "this correspondence is the same one which appears in @xcite .",
    "for the correspondence between fock spaces , we firstly notice that we can use the same state as a vacuum state for two theories .",
    "this fact is easily seen by the following relation which results from eq.([map for ladder ] ) , @xmath192 based on this relation and eq.([map for ladder ] ) , we easily find @xmath193 this equation means the star - deformed fock states we argued in section 3 are equal to the ordinary fock states .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a new quantization scheme for noncommutative field theories , where we promote fields to operators by imposing the star - deformed canonical commutation relation ( [ nccr0 ] ) instead of the standard canonical commutation relation . based on this deformed commutation relation , a consistent quantum theory is constructed , e.g.",
    ", the fock space representation ( [ fock state ] ) for the free field provides a physical picture of a particle .",
    "we find , unexpectedly , that the resulting dynamics are the same as the commutative field theory , even though the classical action possesses a noncommutative interaction term .",
    "this is caused by the cancellation between the noncommutativity in the interaction term and the noncommutativity introduced in the quantization .",
    "we are thus allowed to apply the renormalization procedure in the parturbation calculation in exactly the same way as the ordinary commutative qft .",
    "the noncommutativity cancellation observed here does not mean that the new quantization is trivial . indeed , further observations of the structure of this noncommutativity cancellation show that , if we use different noncommutative parameters for the interaction term and the quantization ( i.e. , @xmath118-theory ) , the resulting dynamics are the same as those of the noncommutative qft with noncommutative parameter @xmath129 . in particular , starting from a commutative action and quantizing fields by the noncommutative quantization ( i.e. , @xmath140-theory ) , one obtains a theory equivalent to the ordinary noncommutative qft with the noncommutative interaction term and fields quantized by the canonical quantization ( i.e. , @xmath139-theory ) .",
    "this indicates that we can also introduce the noncommutativity of a noncommutative qft in the quantization procedure rahter than in the action as conventionally done",
    ". it may be possible to make use of this structure to study the ordinary noncommutative qft using the canonical quantization .",
    "on the other hand , this structure implies that it is impossible to tell which of the quantizations , the canonical quantization or the deformed one , is realized in nature from any experimental observations .",
    "this is because all the @xmath118-theories with the same value of @xmath129 yield the same dynamics . by observations",
    ", we can only determine the value of @xmath130 .",
    "finally , we mention another possibility for the fock space representation . instead of the fock space representation defined in section 2.3 , we could also define the basis vectors as @xmath194 in place of eq.([fock state ] ) .",
    "these basis vectors also provide energy - momentum eigenstates on account of eq.([momentum commutation relation ] ) . the difference from the original one eq.([fock state ] ) arises only in the phase factor : @xmath195|\\bk_1,\\bk_2,\\cdots,\\bk_n).\\ ] ] we can immediately find that the difference results in a change of the statistics of a particle .",
    "in fact , if we consider @xmath196 as particle states , those particles obey nontrivial statistics due to the momentum dependent phase factor , rather than the conventional bose statistics .",
    "although the quantization we present here is only one of many possible quantizations , we believe that our results should be sufficient to suggest that the canonical quantization is not the only viable quantization for noncommutative field theories .",
    "after this paper was posted on the hep - th archives , we have been informed that @xcite include results related to this paper .",
    "in particular , the green s functions considered in @xcite can be constructed from the field operator quantized by the noncommutative quantization in this paper . indeed , if we define green s functions without star products rather than ( [ green ] ) , they would agree with those of @xcite .",
    "in addition , the equivalence of green s functions of a qft and its twisted version demonstrated perturbatively in @xcite is essentially the same as the noncommutativity cancellation proved even nonperturbatively in this paper .",
    "these facts imply that @xcite could provide the path integral formulation for the noncommutative quantization in this paper .",
