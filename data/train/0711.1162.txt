    "a new population of subluminous and extremely compact objects have been recently discovered in cluster and group environments ( drinkwater et al . 2000 ; phillips et al .",
    "2001 ) these ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( hereafter ucds ) are dynamically distinct systems having intrinsic sizes @xmath1 100 pc and absolute magnitudes in the @xmath2-band in the range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 placing them in the lower range of dwarf galaxy luminosities ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "a number of different scenarios have been proposed for origin of ucds ( e.g. evstigneeva et al .",
    "2007 and references within ) : ( a)they are simply very big and luminous globular clusters , ( b)they are nucleated dwarf galaxies , ( c)they are the resulting objects of the coalescence of several globular clusters , ( d)they are the remnants of stripped disk galaxies . in this work",
    "we compare the last two scenarios .",
    "oh and lin ( 2000 ) , oh , lin and richer ( 2000 ) as well as fellhauer and kroupa ( 2002 ) investigated the third formation scenario .",
    "the latter authors performed @xmath0-body simulations of the merging of several globular clusters and argued that the resulting object resembled a ucd .",
    "their simulations initiated with a supercluster , an accumulation of up to fifty globular clusters , orbiting inside a host galaxy on fairly elliptical orbits and with apo - galactic distances around 20kpc .",
    "the globular clusters merged within the supercluster giving rise to an object with values for surface brightness and absolute bolometric luminosity comparable to ucds .",
    "the last formation scenario has been discussed in oh , lin & aarseth ( 1995 ) as well as bekki et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "the latter authors performed numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of nucleated dwarf galaxies orbiting inside ngc 1399 and the fornax cluster . adopting a plausible scaling relation for dwarf galaxies , bekki et al . found that the outer stellar envelope of a nucleated dwarf was totally removed by tidally stripping over the course of several passages from the central region of their host .",
    "the nucleus is so dense that it will always survive the tidal field of a group or cluster potential . by construction in the initial conditions ,",
    "the size and luminosity of the remnant were similar to those observed for ucds and the host galaxy was a plummer model halo which has a constant density core and therefore easy to tidally disrupt leaving behind the central nucleus which would be associated with a ucd galaxy .",
    "the main goal of the present study is to shed light into the formation of ucds investigating the last two formation scenarios in more detail and with more realistic initial conditions .",
    "first , we adopt the fellhauer and kroupa ( 2002 ) model and combine it with the cold dark matter model ( cdm ) paradigm .",
    "we assume that globular clusters form and subsequently orbit around dark matter haloes having masses comparable to that of the fornax dwarf spheroidal and containing no other baryonic matter .",
    "due to dynamical friction , these globular cluster would spiral in towards the centre of the halo .",
    "we perform collisionless @xmath0-body simulations of this process and show that the object resulting from the coalescence of the globular clusters at the halo centre resembles a ucd . as we demonstrate below , the above model suffers from two major drawbacks which rule out its applicability for ucd formation .",
    "the first issue is related to the observed high m / l ratio ( between 6 and 9 in solar units ) recently reported for ucds @xcite .",
    "one has to note here that the m / l ratio of ucds is still debated ( micheal drinkwater , private communication , compare evstigneeva et al .",
    "2007 who quote a m / l for ucds 3 and 5 in solar units ) .",
    "such high values can probably not be achieved by the above mechanism .",
    "this is because sinking globular clusters will expel most of the dark matter particles from the halo centre @xcite .",
    "if there is no dark matter in ucds , fellhauer and kroupa ( 2006 ) describe a possible way to enhance the mass - to - light ratios of ucds through tidal interactions .",
    "the second problem with this scenario is related to the total luminosity of an ucd . at least today , dark matter halos with a sufficient number of globular clusters to produce such bright objects are very rare @xcite .",
    "second , we examine the scenario of bekki et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2003 ) which is based on the hypothesis that ucds are remnants of stripped nucleated galaxies .",
    "this mechanism has also been discussed by kazantzidis et al .",
    "we test this model using sph simulations of a low mass galaxy which forms a nucleus via gas inflow to the inner @xmath5 parsecs .",
    "once this galaxy is placed on a critical disrupting orbit within a cluster potential , the surviving nucleus is in excellent agreement with the latest observational constraints for ucds , including their dark matter content and spatial distribution .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the globular cluster numerical simulations and compare the properties of the resulting object with those of ucds .",
    "section 3 contains results from the simulations of tidal stripping of disk galaxies inside a host cluster potential .",
    "finally , in section 4 we summarise our main conclusions .",
    "the globular cluster simulations were performed with pkdgrav2 a multi stepping , parallel @xmath0-body tree code @xcite .",

    "the innermost shell has 100pc radius .",
    "the second shell is between 100 and 500pc while the third shell contains the rest of the halo .",
    "the softening lengths for these shells are 1 , 10 and 100pc respectively .",
    "this shell model allows us to resolve the detailed kinematics within the central few parsecs whilst retaining the global structure of the halo out to its virial radius of 29.39 kpc .",
    "we use ten globular clusters consisting of @xmath13 particles and being represented by the king model @xcite @xmath14 each globular cluster is constructed with a w@xmath15 parameter of 6 , a total mass of @xmath16m@xmath12 , a central velocity dispersion of 11km / s , and an absolute magnitudes of -8.5 , assuming a mass to light ratio of 2 @xcite .",
    "we use 1pc for its gravitational softening length .",
    "the ten globular clusters are initially distributed within the halo between 20pc and 1000pc .",
    "they are spatially distributed according to @xmath17 , which is in agreement with observations of globular cluster populations in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "we randomly place the globular clusters on circular orbits ( we also tried different orbital and spatial distributions including @xmath18 and @xmath19 with similar results as in the standard @xmath20 case . ) .    the dwarf halo which contained the globular clusters",

    "if we assume a mass to light ratio of three , we expect an absolute visual magnitude of -11 for the final object . for comparison , a typical ucds found in fornax has a central velocity dispersion of 22km / s , an absolute magnitude of -12 and a half mass radius of 25pc @xcite . in order to form this system by merging globular clusters one would need to consider many more globulars to reach the observed luminosity .",
    "this turns out to be a crucial point of this formation scenario because the presence of more than ten globulars in such a halo is extremely rare @xcite .    in our second simulation , the fifty globular clusters merged completely within a few million years .",

    "this effect has been discussed in more detail in read et al .",

    "in other words , the observed m / l ratio can not possibly be reached without dark matter .",

    "= 8.4 cm = 7.0 cm",
    "the second scenario we consider for the formation of ucds is that they are the remnants of stripped disk galaxies . for the numerical experiments performed in this section , we build galaxy models using the following procedure .",

    "we include a gaseous component of mass equal to a fraction @xmath40 of the total halo mass .",
    "the gas has originally the same radial distribution and a temperature profile such that it is in hydrostatic equilibrium for an adiabatic equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the gas component has a specific angular momentum distribution and spin parameter consistent with values found for dark matter haloes within cosmological n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "we constructed a dark plus gaseous halo model with parameters that are expected to produce disks similar to the local group galaxy m33 which has a small dense stellar nucleus .",
    "the model parameters were : @xmath41 m@xmath12 , @xmath42 kpc , @xmath43 km / s , @xmath44 , baryonic fraction @xmath45 and spin parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the value of the concentration may seem a little bit low , when comparing it to the results of macci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) but it is the best fit for the m33 galaxy @xcite which is the possible prototype progenitor for ucds , we want to test here .",
    "the value of the spin parameter is what one gets from cosmological dark matter simulations .",
    "this net spin results from adding many large , almost randomly oriented angular momenta of individual dark matter particles .",
    "uniformly rotating gas halos are normally not observed in cosmological simulations , gas is accreted pretty much like the dark matter , leading to random , large bulk motions and turbulence @xcite .",
    "so one has to note here that this setup is designed to produce cored disks for the subsequent experiments and not necessarily an attempt to follow disk and core formation realistically .",
    "the hot gaseous halo is resolved with @xmath47 particles of equal mass @xmath48 m@xmath8 .",
    "we sampled the dark matter halo with @xmath49 particles having variable masses with the resolution increasing towards the centre of the system @xcite . with a single - particle model",
    "one would need about ten million particles to reach a comparable resolution in the central region .",
    "this allows us to simulate the central dark matter cusp with softening of 100 pc ( this is the same for all dark matter and gas particles ) and particle mass of @xmath50 m@xmath8 . the detailed description of the initial conditions and results of the evolution of the disk are presented in kaufmann et al .",

    "gasoline uses a spline kernel with compact support for the softening of the gravitational and sph quantities .",
    "the energy equation is solved using the asymmetric formulation , which is shown to yield very similar results compared to the entropy conserving formulation but conserves energy better @xcite .",
    "the code includes radiative cooling for a primordial mixture of helium and ( atomic ) hydrogen . because of the lack of molecular cooling and metals , the efficiency of our cooling functions drops rapidly below 10000 k , but we adopt a temperature floor of @xmath51 15000 k , to crudely mimic the effect of heating sources such as supernovae explosions and radiation ( e.g. ultraviolet ) backgrounds .",
    "these simulations were performed without star formation .",
    "we do not expect them to suffer from the sph problems pointed out by agertz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) because for the disk forming part of the simulations we are adopting a large temperature floor and do not aim to simulate the actual multiphase ism , where the problems would occur .",
    "the gas cools slowly to form a disk and stars are formed at a rather low threshold , therefore there is problem with our simulations ( oscar agertz , private communication ) . for a detailed discussion on the performance of sph for the stripping part of the simulations we defer the interested reader to mccarthy ( 2007 ) .    due to cooling",

    "we start with the disk at pericentre , 100 kpc far from the centre of the static potential , and give it a perpendicular velocity of 260 km / s , such that it should reach an apocentre at 30 kpc .",
    "the plane of the disk is tilted by 45@xmath55 with respect to the plane of the orbit . on this orbit",
    "the outer galactic halo and gas are quickly stripped from the nucleus .",
    "the resolution of our hydrodynamic simulation is not sufficient to allow a meaningful comparison with the observations .",
    "however the half light radius , luminosity and dark matter content all agree well with observations up to the given resolution limits ( see fig . [ dmden ] ) , the mass to light ratio within the optical radius ( @xmath56 50pc ) is about 4 .",
    "and the ucd is dark matter dominated up to the resolution limit .",
    "= 8.4 cm = 7.0 cm      if the orbit of the galaxy does not penetrate the centre of the cluster then the disk would not be stripped and the object would not be classified as a ucd . if the progenitors are nucleated disks which are tidally transformed into nucleated spheroidals de(n ) via galaxy harassment @xcite then we might expect a transition region from central ucds to outer de(n ) .",
    "since ucds are all located close to the centres of clusters and groups this allows us to explore the conditions under which complete disruption occurs and how that is affected by the amount of dissipation ( steepening of the central potential ) .    in what follows",
    ", we performed an extensive set of simulations to identify the orbits on which the disk galaxy is completely stripped and on which it remains intact .",
    "the first case would correspond to a ucd and the second to a de(n ) .",
    "the central potential of the sph galaxy is deepened significantly due to dissipation .",
    "the object will be harder to completely disrupt as compared to the initial dark matter halo of the model for example .",
    "we therefore make a systematic study of the orbits that lead to disruption versus survival for the nucleated m33 galaxy model and for the initial uncompressed dark matter halo - the latter simulations define the optimum scenario for complete disruption .",
    "these simulations all start at their respective apocentres and run for the same physical time ( 5 gyr ) in the cluster potential , and explore different orbital apocentres and pericentres .",
    "if stripping of disk galaxies is the correct mechanism for forming ucds and de(n ) , there must be a very sudden transition between these two cases .",
    "this is because we do not observe an intermediate object with features lying in between these very distinct two types of galaxies .",
    "= 8.4 cm = 7.0 cm    fig .",
    "[ striporbit ] presents surface brightness profiles of the disk galaxy after orbiting the static cluster potential for 5 gyr on various orbits .",
    "a sudden transition is clearly seen in this plot : almost two orders of magnitude in surface brightness lie between the ( 150 - 30 ) and the ( 125 - 25 ) orbit at the radii of interest , so the disk either survives or is completely disrupted .",
    "[ allsims ] presents a scatter plot of apocentres versus pericentres for all cases we simulated along with indications about the fate of the orbiting system .",
    "the dividing line between disrupted and surviving disks is given by @xmath57 with a = -0.32 and b = 68 .",
    "we also repeated the above stripping experiments with the dark matter halo only without the gas disk .",
    "results of these experiments are included in fig .",
    "[ allsims ] .",
    "= 8.4 cm = 7.0 cm    in this case the transition is not as sudden as in the disk case therefore we define a halo to be completely disrupted , if less than 0.1 % of the virial mass is still bound . defining complete disruption by the bound mass getting below a certain threshold",
    "is the most objective way to do so .",
    "the value of 0.1% , may seem arbitrary , but it is actually the value , which gave the most convincing values for the given resolution and algorithm . to estimate the mass which is still bound we used the group finding algorithm skid @xcite . there is a clear separation between survival and disruption that depends only on the apocentre and pericenter .",
    "the theoretical explanation for the orbits that lead to complete disruption is fairly intricate and will be discussed in a later paper .",
    "the dividing line between disrupted and surviving haloes is given roughly by two straight lines : @xmath58 with a = -0.11 , b = 84.0 , c = -0.8 , d = 335.0 , with the transition between them at @xmath59 370 kpc .",
    "given these empirically determined survival / disruption curves , we can sample orbits from a cosmological cluster mass cdm halo and determine the expected radial profile of completely disrupted haloes ( ucds ) in each of these two cases .",
    "from the cosmological simulation we chose the one cluster which was not perturbed by neighbouring clusters , had only a single nucleus and came closest in @xmath60 and @xmath61 to the virgo cluster .",
    "we evolved the halo for 5 gyr and binned all particles according to their projected distance from the centre at the last simulation output . for each bin we determined the fraction of particles",

    "the sph disk galaxy stripping simulations correspond to the lower cosmological prediction .",
    "we have to remind the reader again that our prototype progenitor was m33 that has a concentration , which might look a bit low according to macci et al .",
    "therefore the subhalo disruption and the ucd fractions might be slightly overestimated .",
    "however , one could image the progenitor being heavier , therefore less concentrated and thus showing the same disruption behaviour as the haloes we present .",
    "unfortunately we did not have the computational resources to explore parameter space any further .",

    "2006 ) are converted into kpc assuming that the virgo and fornax cluster lie at distances of 16 and 20 mpc , respectively . in a @xmath39cdm universe ,",
    "haloes are approximately self similar so we can compare results by scaling everything with respect to the virial radius .",

    "one must bear in mind though that we only have position data for 15 ucds from the literature .",
