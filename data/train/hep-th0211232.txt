    "systems of interacting open- and closed - strings play important roles in several aspects of string theory .",
    "it has been found out that theories even formulated as pure closed - strings have open - string sectors when they are accompanied by d - branes @xcite .",
    "one of the most important features of such open - closed mixed systems is a duality between open- and closed - strings .",
    "this duality becomes manifest , for instance , by seeing one - loop diagrams of open - string as tree propagations of closed - string through modular transformations on the string world - sheets . in the systems of d - branes ,",
    "this duality should be a rationale for correspondence between gauge theory on the world - volumes ( open - string sector ) and gravity theory in the bulk space - time ( closed - string sector ) .",
    "ads / cft correspondence @xcite@xcite@xcite may be regarded as one of the most remarkable examples of such bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "this viewpoint was emphasized also in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it becomes very difficult to establish the correspondence between the two .",
    "this is essentially because light particles ( ir effects ) in the one sector are realized by summing up whole massive towers ( uv effects ) in the other sector .",
    "when a constant @xmath0 field background of closed - string is turned on , however , we expect that the situation could be drastically changed . on this background ,",
    "the world - volumes of d - branes become non - commutative  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "low - energy effective theories of the open - string sector , therefore , become field theories on the non - commutative world - volumes .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that in such theories there happens a mixing of the uv and the ir .",
    "this uv / ir mixing gives @xcite us a chance to capture some effects of light particles in the bulk gravity theories , e.g.  gravitons , by investigating non - commutative field theories on the world - volumes .",
    "to pursue such possibility , non - planar one - loop amplitudes of open - string were studied on this background @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "higher loops were investigated as well in @xcite .",
    "coupling of non - commutative d - branes to closed - string in the bulk has attracted much interest particularly from the viewpoint of bulk - boundary correspondence @xcite@xcite .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite@xcite that the generalized star - products arise in disk amplitudes consisting of a closed - string vertex operator and open - string vertex ones on a constant @xmath0 field background .",
    "the generalized star products are also found to appear in straight open wilson lines by the expansions in powers of non - commutative gauge fields @xcite .",
    "these observations were combined in @xcite and it was shown there that in the zero - slope limit of @xcite disk amplitudes of a closed - string tachyon and arbitrary numbers of gauge fields on this background give rise to a straight open wilson line . thus it has been clarified that open wilson lines play a role in the correspondence between the bulk gravity and the non - commutative gauge theories .",
    "open wilson lines found in @xcite are remarkable gauge invariant objects in non - commutative gauge theories .",
    "gauge invariant operators in non - commutative gauge theories can be constructed in the forms of local operators smeared along straight wilson lines  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that coupling of closed - string graviton to non - commutative gauge theories actually is an operator of this form .",
    "open wilson lines need not be straight in order to be gauge invariant . taking account of the above role played by straight open wilson lines in the bulk - boundary duality , dhar and kitazawa @xcite conjectured that curved open wilson lines fluctuating around a straight path",
    "should be brought about by higher level ( stringy ) states of closed - string .",
    "they showed that the coupling of graviton state is in fact the gauge invariant operator which appears in the leading coefficients in harmonic expansions of curved open wilson lines around a straight path .",
    "it is well - known that the so - called boundary states @xcite@xcite@xcite provide a description of d - branes in closed - string theory . open- and closed - strings interact on the branes in space - time .",
    "therefore it is further expected that boundary states admit to describe these interactions . in this article , receiving the above development and understanding , we study the system of a d - brane in bosonic string theory on a constant @xmath0 field background . in order to obtain further insight into the bulk - boundary duality , we first exploit the boundary state formalism to include states which describe arbitrary numbers of open - string tachyons and gluons .",
    "open - string legs of these boundary states , that is , tachyons and gluons , need not to be on - shell .",
    "thereby it becomes possible to study the duality .    on a constant @xmath0 field background ,",
    "boundary state without open - string legs has been constructed in @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is briefly reviewed in the next section .",
    "let us denote the state by @xmath1 .",
    "this state does not lead any couplings of a closed - string to open - string excitations on the world - volume .",
    "we may regard @xmath1 as a perturbative vacuum of closed - string in the presence of the brane .",
    "it is also possible to interpret the state as a bogolubov transform of the @xmath2-invariant vacuum of closed - string : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a suitable generator of the transformation .    in section [ sec : tachyon boundary state ] we construct boundary states of open - string tachyons .",
    "basic idea of the construction may be explained as follows .",
    "we first examine an insertion of a closed - string tachyon into the brane .",
    "let us suppose that the closed - string world - sheet is an infinite semi - cylinder @xmath5 with @xmath6 and that the brane or the state @xmath1 is located at @xmath7 .",
    "we may describe the insertion by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a closed - string tachyon vertex operator .",
    "however , there occurs a singularity within @xmath9 at the world - sheet boundary .",
    "this originates in correlations between the chiral and the anti - chiral sectors which are caused by the brane .",
    "we then regularize such a singularity and define a renormalized tachyon vertex operator @xmath10 .",
    "it turns out surprisingly that the renormalized operator becomes an open - string tachyon vertex at the boundary . in our prescription of the renormalization , disk green s function and the transform",
    "@xmath11 play essential roles .",
    "boundary state of a single open - string tachyon is given by @xmath12 .",
    "boundary states of arbitrary numbers of open - string tachyons turn out to be realized by the successive insertions of the above renormalized operators . as for boundary states of gluons",
    ", they can be obtained by taking the same steps as illustrated above , except that we need to introduce a suitable local operator of closed - string in place of @xmath9 and renormalize it in a suitable fashion .",
    "these are presented in section [ sec : gluon boundary state ] .",
    "consistency of the constructions is examined from several aspects at some length . in particular , we compute closed - string tree propagations between these boundary states and make sure that they reproduce the corresponding open - string one - loop amplitudes .",
    "these are presented separately in section [ sec : tachyon boundary state ] for the tachyons and in section [ sec : gluon boundary state ] for the gluons .",
    "it is also worth noting that the present constructions are relevant on a vanishing @xmath0 field background .",
    "low - energy description of world - volume theories of d - branes is obtained by taking a zero - slope limit @xmath13 so that it makes all perturbative stringy states ( @xmath14 ) of open - string infinitely heavy and decouple from the light states . as regards one - loop amplitudes of open - string , this can be achieved by taking the limit with @xmath15 fixed . here",
    "@xmath16 is the proper time on the world - sheet of open - string .",
    "the fixed parameter @xmath17 becomes the schwinger parameter of one - loop amplitudes of low - energy effective world - volume theories .",
    "it is shown @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite that one - loop amplitudes of open - string tachyons on a constant @xmath0 field background reduce to those of a non - commutative ( tachyonic ) scalar field theory on the world - volume .",
    "the above zero - slope limit can be interpreted as magnification of the string amplitudes in the vicinity of @xmath18 . in section [ sec : uv nc scalar ] we investigate a possible uv behavior of this non - commutative field theory . in order to know the uv behavior one needs to focus on the region @xmath19 . for the description",
    "we take the following route .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the closed - string proper time .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are related to each other through the modular transformation of the world - sheet by @xmath24 .",
    "then we take a zero - slope limit with @xmath23 fixed .",
    "existence of @xmath0 field allows us to make the limit slightly different from the standard field theory limit of closed - string ( gravity limit ) .",
    "this enables us to capture the world - volume theories .",
    "this zero - slope limit is magnification of the string amplitudes in the vicinity of @xmath25 and hence the region @xmath19 . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is a trans - string scale of the world - volume theories . generating function of one - loop amplitudes of open - string tachyons is found out to be factorized at the limit into two ( analogues of ) straight open wilson lines exchanging closed - string tachyons . in general ,",
    "one - loop amplitudes of open - string are factorized by a tower of closed - string states . in gravity limit",
    "the propagations of closed - string tachyons become dominant .",
    "although the present limit is slightly different from gravity limit , these zero - slope limits share the common property .",
    "uv behavior of the non - commutative gauge theory is explored in section [ sec : uv nc gauge ] by following the same route .",
    "generating function of one - loop amplitudes of gluons is also found out to be factorized at this limit into two straight open wilson lines exchanging closed - string tachyons .",
    "these analyses indicate a possibility that field theories on the non - commutative world - volume become topological at such a trans - string scale of the world - volume .",
    "the conjecture @xcite leads us to expect that curved open wilson lines somehow factorize generating functions of one - loop amplitudes of gluons or open - string tachyons .",
    "the standard factorization made by particle states of closed - string seems to be little use .",
    "instead , momentum eigenstates of closed - string are used for the factorization .",
    "closed - string momentum @xmath26 is a momentum loop ( a loop in the momentum space ) while closed - string coordinate @xmath27 is a space - time loop .",
    "section [ sec : comments on eigenstates ] is devoted to introduction of coordinate and momentum eigenstates of closed - string .",
    "we also provide some observations on their relations with boundary states .",
    "factorizations made by the momentum eigenstates are examined in section  [ sec : open wilson lines ( i ) ] for the tachyons and in section [ sec : open wilson lines ( ii ) ] for the gluons .",
    "it turns out that in the zero - slope limit ( the previous uv limit of the world - volume theories ) momentum loops become curves in the non - commutative world - volume and that open wilson lines along these curves appear in the factorizations .",
    "the generating functions are factorized by two curved open wilson lines .",
    "more precisely , they become integrals on the space of curves with a gaussian distribution around straight lines . as",
    "regards fluctuations from the straight lines , width of the distribution becomes so sharp that the integrals reduce to the previous factorizations by straight open wilson lines .",
    "we start section [ sec : open wilson lines ( ii ) ] by giving a proof of the conjecture made by dhar and kitazawa .",
    "we introduce the closed - string state @xmath28 , where @xmath26 is a momentum loop .",
    "this state is not an eigenstate of closed - string momentum but serves as a generating function of ( generally off - shell ) closed - string states .",
    "overlap between @xmath29 and boundary states with open - string legs is a generating function of couplings of all the closed - string states to the non - commutative d - brane .",
    "the overlap with the boundary states of gluons is shown to become a curved open wilson line in the zero - slope limit .",
    "we make an explicit correspondence between the closed - string states and the coefficients of harmonic expansions of the curve .",
    "these provide the proof .",
    "we also show that in the zero - slope limit the momentum eigenstate is identified with the state @xmath30 after some manipulation .",
    "this accounts for the previous factorizations by curved open wilson lines .",
    "wilson line is invariant under reparametrizations of the path .",
    "the corresponding transformations on the string world - sheet are reparametrizations of the boundary .",
    "the reparametrization invariance of boundary states is fulfilled by imposing the ishibashi condition @xcite or equivalently the brst invariance on these states . as regards the boundary states of open - string tachyon and gluon it is shown in sections [ sec : tachyon boundary state ] and [ sec : gluon boundary state ] that their reparametrization invariance is equivalent to the on - shell conditions .",
    "on the other hand we do not require any condition on gluons to obtain open wilson lines .",
    "this puzzle is solved by seeing that the ishibashi condition or the brst invariance becomes null in the present zero - slope limit .",
    "it is observed in section [ sec : discussions ] that all the boundary states constructed so far in this article are eigenstates of the closed - string momentum operators .",
    "the eigenvalues are essentially delta functions on the world - sheet boundary .",
    "their boundary actions are computed by following the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that they are the standard boundary actions used in the path - integral formalism of the world - sheet theory . after a speculation based on these observations",
    "we finally make a conjecture on the duality between open- and closed- strings .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : open - string tensors ] world - volume and space - time tensors used in the text are summarized including their relations . in appendix",
    "[ sec : formulae ] some formulae of creation and annihilation modes are described .",
    "these are necessary for our computations of several string amplitudes in the text .",
    "oscillator realizations of coordinate and momentum eigenstates are presented in appendix [ sec : eigen ] .",
    "let us consider the system of d@xmath31-brane in bosonic string theory .",
    "we take the following closed - string background : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is a flat space - time metric , which we refer to as closed - string metric .",
    "two - form gauge field @xmath34 is constant .",
    "we divide the space - time directions into two pieces , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the directions @xmath38 are supposed to be parallel to the d@xmath31-brane .",
    "the directions @xmath39 are perpendicular to the brane .",
    "closed - string may capture the brane .",

    "in contrast with the previous scaling we keep them intact . this is because the present limit is not expected to allow a naive world - line description . as can be observed in the expression ( [ equivalence with boundary state formalism for gluon ] ) these parameters are nothing but the auxiliary parameters used for the description of gluon vertex operators in the boundary state formalism .        as was pointed out in the previous study of the scalar field theory , the zero - slope limit based on the closed - string parameters describes physics at the trans - string scale of the world - volume theory .",
