    "ngc 2264 is a cluster of young stars , part of the mon ob1 association .",
    "it is about 3 myrs old @xcite , and the shape of its initial mass function is very similar to that of orion @xcite .",
    "pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars have been identified in ngc 2264 using a variety of methods , including @xmath0 spectroscopy @xcite , @xmath0 narrow band photometry @xcite , irregular variability @xcite , near ir photometry @xcite , proper motions @xcite , and x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several techniques have been used to identify circumstellar disk candidates , including excess ultraviolet ( @xmath1 ) emission , excess near ir ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) emission , and @xmath0 emission line equivalent widths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have found a good correlation between disk indicators and report lower limits for the disk fraction ranging from 21% to 56% .",
    "they also found a typical value for mass accretion rates of @xmath4 , comparable to the values derived for orion and taurus - auriga .",
    "ngc 2264 provides a laboratory for studying the interrelationships of rotation , mass accretion , disk indicators and x - ray luminosity of pms stars .",
    "the question of how exactly these things are related is still an open problem in star formation phenomenology .",
    "there is a clear relationship between rotation rate ( period ) and x - ray luminosity ( @xmath5 ) found in late - type stars in clusters as old as ngc 2547 ( 15 - 40 myrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) through the hyades ( @xmath6500 myrs , * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio between the x - ray and bolometric luminosity , @xmath5/@xmath7 , increases with increasing rotation rate , until the most rapidly rotating stars reach a maximum x - ray luminosity ( or saturation level ) such that @xmath5/@xmath7@xmath8 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "it is much less clear that rotation and @xmath5/@xmath7   are related in younger clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "analyze data for a number of young associations and clusters ( including orion ) , and agree that there is little correlation between @xmath5/@xmath7   and rotation at very young ages , but conclude that the data are consistent with a single physical mechanism , where the orion - age stars are simply all at or near the saturation level ( and that level and the critical velocity for it are a function of gravity / age ) .",

    "the chandra sensitivity extends the x - ray flux limit from the rosat value of log@xmath5(erg / s)@xmath630.1 to log@xmath5(erg / s)@xmath628.5 , allowing us to detect lower mass stars and explore the mass dependence of the rotation and @xmath5   relationship .    in the present paper",

    "we rely heavily on data from our earlier papers in this cluster , @xcite and @xcite , providing optical photometry and periods , respectively .",
    "ngc 2264 was observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) detector on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite on 2002 february 9 .",
    "the results presented here arise from the imaging array ( acis - i ) , which consists of four 1024@xmath91024 front - side illuminated ccds .",

    "the total exposure time of the acis observations is 48.1 ks .",
    "we started data analysis with the level 1 processed event list provided by the pipeline processing at the _ chandra _ x - ray center .",
    "we have kept all events , including the ones flagged as cosmic ray afterglows by the pipeline .",
    "the presence of spurious sources due to cosmic ray afterglows was eliminated using the light curves of the detected sources ( see sec .  [ variability ] ) .",
    "the energy and grade of each data event were corrected for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) , applying the algorithm code described in @xcite .",
    "then , the event file was filtered by asca grades ( keeping grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 ) ; by time intervals ; and by background flaring due to solar activity .",
    "removal of the background flares identified by the latter step reduced the exposure time to 47.4 ks .",

    "this tool works well in separating closely spaced point sources .",

    "of the 43 light curves having a cosmic ray shape , 40 ( 93% ) contain cosmic ray afterglows flagged by the pipeline .",
    "our final list of 263 x - ray sources is listed in table  [ tab_xray ] .",

    "the spectra are extracted within @xmath24 using the ciao tool _",
    "dmextract_. the spectra of these 15 brightest x - ray sources are shown in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "the redistribution matrix files ( rmf ) and auxiliary response files ( arf ) files contain instrument response information that are essential for the spectral fitting process .",
    "we use the rmf files provided by the cti corrector by @xcite .",
    "arf files were created for each source , using the ciao tool _",
    "mkarf_. the computed arfs were later corrected to account for the acis low energy quantum efficiency degradation , using the acisabs absorption model .",

    "we adopted a photoelectric absorption model ( @xmath34 ) , which uses wisconsin cross sections from @xcite .",
    "this model has one parameter that is the equivalent hydrogen column density ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the hydrogen column density was fixed to a value of 0.08@xmath36 to match an extinction value of @xmath37 = 0.41 , which is the most likely value of the observed extinction towards ngc 2264 , although the @xmath37 can be as high as 3.5 mag ( see * ? ? ? * for more discussion ) .",
    "the value of the column density was derived using the relationship of @xmath38 .",
    "if we consider a @xmath39 , which corresponds to three magnitudes more than the assumed @xmath37 , the derived @xmath5   would be only 0.1 dex less .",
    "thus , the error in @xmath5   that comes from fixing @xmath35 is negligible .",
    "we also adopted a thermal emission model ( @xmath40 ) , which is based on model calculations of @xcite , and @xcite with fe l calculations by @xcite .",
    "this model includes line emissions from several elements .",
    "the remaining two parameters in the model - the plasma temperature ( kt ) and a normalization factor - were varied in order to fit the spectra .",
    "we initially tried one temperature models , but they failed to fit the low energy part of the spectrum .",
    "a two temperature model significantly improved the spectral fitting for all the sources .",
    "the brightest x - ray source in the sample 196 ( s mon ) has a distinctive soft x - ray spectrum , characteristic of its early spectral type ( see sec .",
    "[ ostar ] ) .",
    "it also has a high count rate of 155 counts ks@xmath41 , and may be affected by pileup ( at high count rate the observed flux is no longer a linear function of the count rate ) . given the spectral characteristics of s mon and its possible pileup effects , we did not include it in the determination of the conversion factor that leads to the determination of x - ray luminosity for our sample of x - ray sources .",
    "the spectral parameters obtained from the two plasma temperature models are listed in table  [ tab_spectra ] .",
    "the x - ray flux of s mon listed in table  [ tab_spectra ] is the integration of the two temperature model between 0.3 and 8.0 kev .",
    "the x - ray flux for the rest of the bright sources is determined from the best spectral model derived from the mean model parameters .",
    "we computed mean plasma temperatures of ( 0.51@xmath220.06 ) kev and ( 2.5@xmath220.3 ) kev .",
    "the mean plasma temperatures are held constant and the integration of the best fit between 0.3 and 8.0 kev provides the x - ray flux .",
    "the resulting x - ray fluxes are listed in table  [ tab_spectra ] .",
    "we use the x - ray fluxes of the 14 bright sources to compute a x - ray flux weighted conversion factor between count rate and x - ray flux .",
    "the obtained conversion factor is ( 6.16@xmath220.13)@xmath42 ( erg/@xmath43/s)/(counts / ks ) .",
    "figure  [ cfactor ] shows the relationship between @xmath44 and x - ray flux for the 14 x - ray sources used to determine the conversion factor .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the derived conversion factor .",
    "we compiled a list of conversion factors obtained by published studies using acis - i data in young stars ; see table  [ tab_compare ] .",
    "the values we list for @xcite and @xcite were computed using the count rate and x - ray luminosity they provide in their tables 3 and 1 respectively .",
    "our conversion factor is in good agreement with the ones derived by @xcite and @xcite , and it differs from the other values by a factor of less than 2 .",
    "the x - ray flux for our catalog of x - ray sources in ngc 2264 , listed in column 10 of table  [ tab_xray ] , was computed using the derived conversion factor .",
    "the x - ray luminosity ,  @xmath5 , listed in column 11 of table  [ tab_xray ] , is computed assuming a distance to ngc 2264 of 760 pc @xcite .",
    "the limiting luminosity in our x - ray observations varies within the field of view , because of the variation of the psf across the field . in figure",
    "[ limit ] , we have plotted the net rate of the detected x - ray sources as a function of the off - axis angle , @xmath21 . the faintest source is located at @xmath45 and it has a count rate of 0.08 counts / ks , corresponding to a x - ray luminosity of 28.5 at the distance of ngc 2264 .",
    "about 80 % of our sources are located within @xmath46 .",
    "at that off - axis angle the limiting count rate has increased to 0.12 counts / ks , corresponding to a x - ray luminosity of log(@xmath5)=28.7 at the distance of ngc 2264 . at @xmath47 ,",
    "we can not detected x - ray sources fainter than 0.35 counts / ks ( log(@xmath5 ) = 29.2 ) .",
    "therefore , we adopt a value of log(@xmath5)=28.5 dex as the limiting x - ray luminosity for our observations , keeping in mind that this value holds for sources located within @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite observed a 40@xmath9100 field towards ngc2 2264 using rosat , detecting 169 sources .",
    "our chandra field ( 17@xmath917 ) is covered within the spatial extent of the rosat observations but goes 1.5 dex deeper in log(@xmath5 ) ( a factor of @xmath6 30 in @xmath5 ) .",
    "there are 34 sources in common between our catalog of x - ray sources in ngc 2264 and the rosat sample of @xcite .",
    "we compared our x - ray luminosities with the ones given by @xcite ( see figure  [ rosat ] ) .",
    "we found a mean difference of 0.1 dex with a standard deviation of 0.3 dex .",
    "this difference does not include an offset of + 0.3 dex in the rosat @xmath5  , as described in @xcite .",
    "given that many of these pms stars are highly variable ( see sec .  [ variability ] ) , we conclude that our luminosities are consistent with respect to those of @xcite .",
    "light curves were determined for all 313 sources detected by _",
    "wavdetect _ using the ciao tool _",
    "lightcurves _ with a bin time of 2500 s. the statistics of the light curves of the sources of our x - ray catalog were obtained using the xronos tool _",

    "the @xmath48 values are listed in column 12 of table  [ tab_xray ] .",
    "the light curves of the sources with @xmath49 90% were analyzed further , since they are the most likely to be variable .",
    "we obtained the reduced @xmath50 of those sources , using two additional light curves with bin times of 5000 s and 7500 s. if the reduced @xmath50 obtained for both bin times was less than 2.5 , then we consider those sources to have constant light curves .",
    "then , we defined a variable source as those having 2500 s bin light curves with @xmath49 90% , and 5000 s and 7500 s bin light curves with reduced @xmath51 2.5 .",
    "there are 41 variable sources that meet this criteria .",
    "variable sources are marked with a v in column 13 of table  [ tab_xray ] . among the variable sources ,",
    "ten have known periods from @xcite , but we find no obvious dependence of x - ray flux with rotational phase for 9 of these stars ( see bellow the discussion about source 181 ) .",
    "there are 14 variable sources which show a flare shape , defined as a rapid increase and a slow decrease in the x - ray flux .",
    "variable sources with a flare - like light curve are marked with an additional f in column 13 of table  [ tab_xray ] . in figure  [ light_curves ] , we show a selection of light curves of sources of comparable luminosity . in the top panels , we show two light curves with a flare shape ; in the middle panels , there are two variable light curves .",
    "finally in the bottom panels , two constant light curves are plotted .",
    "there are six sources that show a possible flare pattern , described as an increase in x - ray flux happening at the end of our observations or a decrease in x - ray flux occurring at the beginning of our observations .",
    "variable sources with a possible flare pattern are marked with an additional p in column 13 of table  [ tab_xray ] .",
    "@xcite detected 10 flaring objects in orion using rosat observations , over a sample of 389 x - ray sources ( @xmath6 3% of flaring objects ) ; @xcite detected 14 flaring objects in ic 348 using chandra observations over a sample of 215 x - ray sources ( @xmath6 7 % of flaring objects ) ; we detected a comparable fraction , about 8% flaring sources ( 5% excluding possible flares ) .",
    "there are two additional variable sources which show a distinctive pattern of variation , either a steady increase or a steady decrease in x - ray flux .",
    "the sources that show this pattern are 75 ( r 2752 ) and 181 ( r 3245 ) , they are marked with an additional s in column 13 of table  [ tab_xray ] , and their light curves are shown in figure  [ light_curves_2 ] .",
    "the amount of variation in these two cases is about a factor of 10 in about 10 hours .",
    "a similar pattern is observed in the light curves of three x - ray ic 348 sources determined by @xcite using chandra observations .",
    "they mention that those light curves may be explained by rotational variability , as described by @xcite , who present a model of rotational modulation of x - ray flares in three t tauri stars and algol .",
    "the amplitude of the variations modeled by @xcite vary from a factor of 2.5 to a factor of 20 , depending on the strength of the x - ray flare .",
    "although both x - ray sources 181 and 75 have optical counterparts , only 181 ( r 3245 ) has an observed period of 1.21 days ( 29 hrs ) from @xcite . if the lightcurve of 181 can be understood by rotational modulation of x - ray flares , then the observed decay time ( @xmath6 11 hrs ) should be less than half of the stellar period .",
    "therefore , the period implied by the x - ray light curve should be greater than 22 hrs , which is consistent with the optical observations .",
    "we correlated the x - ray sources with a catalog of stars in ngc2264 ; see table  [ tab_optical ] .",

    "the shocks may be formed by line - forced instabilities @xcite .",
    "evidence coming from grating x - ray spectroscopy suggests that magnetically confined hot plasma near the surface of the star may be important in some early type stars that show an unusually hard x - ray spectrum ( plasma temperature higher than 2 kev ) and narrow x - ray emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
