    "the study of charmonium at finite temperature has received considerable interest ever since the seminal paper by matusi and satz @xcite .",
    "the behavior of charmoinum at finite temperature was studied using potential models with some screened potential @xcite and it was found that excited states like @xmath8 and @xmath6 are dissociated at @xmath9 while the ground state charmonia @xmath2 and @xmath3 were found to be dissociated at @xmath10 . in last year",
    "s conference ( lattice 2002 ) lattice calculation of the charmonium spectral functions were reported @xcite which indicated that in contrast to potential model expectations ground state charmonia may exist up to temperatures as high as @xmath4 while @xmath6 states are dissociated @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are going to present our results on the charmonium system at finite temperature on isotropic lattice with lattice spacing @xmath0 and @xmath1 gev .",
    "the spectral functions were extracted using the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite and confirm earlier results on survival of the ground state and dissolution of @xmath6 states . the survival of the ground state charmonia has been confirmed also very recently in @xcite . for other studies of meson spectral functions at finite temperature using mem",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we consider the temporal correlators of meson currents @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 for scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial vector channels .",
    "the low - lying states in these channels correspond to @xmath14 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath15 mesons , respectively .",
    "the spectral function which we are interested in is related to the meson correlator by the integral relation @xmath16 although this relation is valid a priori only in the continuum , it has been shown recently that also in the limit of non - interacting theory it holds on the lattice @xcite . in our simulations we used non - perturbatively improved wilson fermions @xcite and the standard wilson action for gauge fields .",
    "the simulation parameters are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath17 values in this table correspond to a vector meson mass close to the actual @xmath2 mass , _",

    "1 we show charmonium spectral functions below the deconfinement temperature , @xmath9 , reconstructed using mem for two different lattice spacings . one can clearly identify the ground state peak corresponding to @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath6 states .",
    "the other structures in the spectral functions are lattice artifacts as their position strongly depends on the lattice spacing ( they scale roughly as @xmath22 ) . in our analysis",

    "however , even without reconstructing the spectral function certain statements about their temperature dependence can be made just by inspecting the temperature dependence of the corresponding meson correlators .",
    "the temperature dependence of the meson correlators comes from the temperature dependence of the integration kernel in eq .",
    "[ rel ] and from the temperature dependence of the spectral function . in order to separate the former effect from the temperature dependence arising from modifications of the spectral function we consider the ratios @xmath25 for different channels with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being the smallest temperature available at that lattice spacing , i.e. @xmath28 for the data set with @xmath0  gev and @xmath29 for data with @xmath24  gev .",

    "we see small gradual modifications of the correlators with increasing temperature which become substantial at @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast to this a strong temperature dependence is seen in the scalar and axial vector channels as we cross @xmath9 .",
    "now let us discuss the spectral functions above @xmath9 .",
    "since the physical extent of the imaginary time direction is rather small at high temperature a reliable reconstruction of the spectral function is difficult . in particular",
    "one finds that the reconstructed spectral functions are quite sensitive to the default model .",
    "thus a correct choice of the default model is important . as we do not expect medium effects at energies considerably larger than the open charm threshold we will use the high energy part of the spectral function calculated below @xmath9 as a default model . at low energy",
