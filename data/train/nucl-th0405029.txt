    "the discovery of jet quenching in central @xmath3 collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory has provided clear evidence for the formation of strongly interacting dense matter .",

    "the absence of these jet quenching phenomena in @xmath4 collisions @xcite proves that they are indeed due to final state interaction .",

    "the observed strong suppression of high @xmath0 hadrons at rhic is in sharp contrast to the results of @xmath6 collisions at the sps energy .",
    "data from the wa98 @xcite experiment show no or little suppression of high @xmath0 ( up to about 4 gev/@xmath7 ) pions @xcite . even if one takes into account the possible uncertainty in the reference @xmath8 data @xcite , the suppression allowed by the data is still significantly less than in @xmath3 collisions at rhic , while the total charged multiplicities or the inferred initial parton densities only differ by a factor of 2 .",
    "this implies that additional physics is at play in the energy dependence of the suppression of single hadron spectra in high - energy heavy - ion collisions",
    ". it could be the energy dependence of the cronin effect due to initial state multiple scattering , the thermalization time and finite lifetime of the dense matter that limits the parton energy loss .",

    "@xcite and also was recently studied in ref .",

    "similarly , the average number of scatterings along the path of parton propagation is @xmath33 inclusion of transverse radial expansion generates a faster dilution of the gluon density relative to 1-d expansion , but also results in longer propagation time in medium .",

    "in central @xmath3 collisions at rhic , however , strong suppression of high @xmath0 hadrons is observed .",

    "this is simply a consequence of the energy dependence of jet spectrum shape .",
    "the initial jet spectra at @xmath46 gev are much steeper than those at 200 gev .",
    "the same amount of energy loss leads to a larger suppression of the final hadron spectra at 62.3 gev than at 200 gev .",
    "as one increases the colliding energy , the power - law spectra for the initial jet production become flatter , and the same parton energy loss will lead to less suppression of the final hadrons . as shown in the same figure ,",
    "the nuclear modification factor at the lhc energy @xmath43 tev is smaller than at 200 gev in the intermediate @xmath0 region , due to larger initial gluon density .",
    "however , the modification factor @xmath1 increases with @xmath0 due to the flatter power - law spectra of jet production at lhc .",
    "the parameterized energy dependence of the parton energy loss is in part due to the detailed balance effect in induced gluon radiation and absorption @xcite .",
    "this effect is most important in the intermediate @xmath0 region . in this region",
    ", one expects the jet fragmentation process to be modified by other non - perturbative processes such as parton recombination or coalescence @xcite .",
    "the observed flavor dependence of the hadron suppression and of the azimuthal anisotropy clearly points to the effect of parton recombination that enhances both baryon and kaon spectra in the presence of dense medium . to include this effect in the current parton model",

    "this gives rise to the splitting of the suppression factor for charged hadrons and @xmath51 in the calculation . because of the steeper power - law spectra of jet production at 62.4 gev",
    ", the effect of the non - perturbative parton recombination persists to higher @xmath0 than in @xmath3 collisions at 200 gev . in this region of @xmath0 ,",

    "they only diverge at high @xmath52 8 gev/@xmath7 where the recombination effects are negligible at both energies .",
    "since the soft components due to parton recombination are not closely related to medium thermalization , they will still contribute to the final hadron spectra in peripheral @xmath10 and @xmath53 collisions .",

    "the early stage of the mixed phase or crossover could also contribute to the jet quenching and thus extend the effective time duration for parton energy loss .",
    "when this time is larger than the average path length , the total parton energy loss is then limited only by the system size . in the previous analysis @xcite ,",
    "such an assumption for central @xmath3 collisions is justified given the high initial energy density .    in central @xmath6 collisions at the sps energy @xmath67 ,",

    "the lifetime of the plasma in central @xmath6 collisions at sps , @xmath68 , if it were formed , is then considerable shorter than that at the highest energy of rhic .",

    "even if one takes into account the uncertainty in the reference @xmath8 data @xcite , which gives a systematic error of about a factor of 2 , the data still point to a short lived dense system with @xmath70 fm/@xmath7 .",
    "this might also explain the observed elliptic flow @xmath71 at sps that is much smaller than the hydrodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the longer lifetime of the plasma allows development of a full hydrodynamic flow , giving rise to a large @xmath71 that saturates the hydrodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "to study the sensitivity of the high @xmath0 hadron suppression to the lifetime of the plasma at @xmath2 gev , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the nuclear modification factors for both charged hadrons and neutral pions with different values of @xmath55 in @xmath3 collisions at @xmath2 gev .",

    ", the hadron suppression is only sensitive to values of @xmath55 that are smaller than the average medium size . in reality",
    ", the values of @xmath55 should decrease from central to peripheral collisions .",

    "the suppression of charged hadron is indeed much smaller than at 200 gev .",
    "however , charged hadrons in this region are also dominated by non - perturbative recombination effects , though our results are still sensitive to the lifetime .",
    "experimental measurements of @xmath51 and high @xmath0 charged hadrons , both are less influenced by the parton recombination effect , should provide more stringent constraints on the lifetime of the dense matter .",
    "within a parton model incorporating medium induced parton energy loss , we have studied in this brief report the suppression of inclusive hadron spectra at high @xmath0 in heavy - ion collisions at different energies .",
    "we found that the @xmath0 dependence of the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 is determined by the energy dependence of the parton energy loss and the power - law behavior of the initial jet spectra . with the onset of parton energy loss and the change of the power - law jet spectra , the @xmath0 dependence of the modification factor changes from monotonic decrease at @xmath2 gev to monotonic increase with @xmath0 at the lhc energy @xmath43 tev .",
    "the flat @xmath0 dependence observed at @xmath5 gev is just a coincidence .",
    "we also studied the sensitivity of the hadron suppression factor to the lifetime of the plasma or the duration of parton energy loss .",
    "we found that the hadron suppression factor at intermediate and large @xmath0 is sensitive to the lifetime if it is comparable or smaller than the system size .",
    "the experimental measurements could provide important constraints .",
    "together with the measurement of elliptic flow , which is also sensitive to the lifetime and thermalization time of the plasma , one can gain additional information on the dynamic evolution of the produced quark - gluon plasma .",

    "we find that suppression of the back - to - back dihadron correlation at 62.4 gev in central @xmath3 collisions is almost identical to that at 200 gev .",
    "this is partly due to the trigger bias that selects dihadron production close to the surface and results in completely suppression the back - side jets that traverse the whole length of the dense matter .",
