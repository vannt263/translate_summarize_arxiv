    "considerable progress has been recently achieved in implementing two - state systems using superconducting nanocircuits .",
    "time - resolved coherent oscillations have been measured in josephson qubits@xcite and signatures of the entanglement of coupled charge qubits have been observed@xcite .",
    "limitations in the performances arise from various noise sources@xcite , often material and device dependent .",
    "recently evidence of noise due to individual impurities behaving as bistable fluctuators ( bf ) has been observed both in spectroscopy and in time resolved dynamical evolution@xcite .",
    "sets of bfs are responsible for low frequency @xmath0 noise@xcite , which is the dominant dephasing mechanism common ( to different extent ) to all solid state implementations . a variety of behaviors , ranging from broadening due to a slow environment@xcite to relaxation limited decoherence@xcite has been also observed , this phenomenology being strongly dependent on the particular device and on details of the protocol@xcite",
    ". explanation of this rich physics is beyond phenomenological theories describing the environment as a suitable set of harmonic oscillators@xcite .",
    "since the physical sources of noise are discrete in nature , attention has been devoted to environments made of collections of bfs@xcite . in this work",
    "we will compare effects of gaussian and non - gaussian noise , and show results indicating that discrete noise models potentially explain the experimental features , the main open question being a characterization beyond phenomenology of the physics of the noise sources@xcite .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian @xmath1 , representing a qubit ( @xmath2 ) anisotropically@xcite coupled to a noise source , described by @xmath3 .",
    "sensitivity to noise can be modulated by tuning the operating point , i.e. the angle @xmath4 between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the qubit splitting @xmath7 being also tunable . for classical noise @xmath8",
    "is a stochastic process , whereas for quantum noise @xmath3 is an operator of the environment .",
    "decoherence results from the sensitivity of the qubit to the environment .",
    "for instance if coupling is weak , relaxation and dephasing rates are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the adiabatic rate , responsible for secular broadening@xcite .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath12 appears , therefore the qubit is able to `` measure '' statistical properties of the environment at the level of two point correlations . in this regime",
    "the qubit is not sensitive to other details , for instance whether a certain lorentzian line shape is due to a bistable fluctuator ( bf ) giving rise to random telegraph noise ( rtn ) or to a continuous gaussian process with _ the same _ lorentzian noise ( gln ) spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rates0].a ) . in solid state devices",
    "@xmath13 may be very large thus invalidating the weak coupling theory .",
    "this is the case of a sufficiently slow environment , no matter how small is @xmath14 .",
    "consider for instance the lorentzian spectrum @xmath15 .",
    "rates in fig .",
    "[ fig : rates0].b show that    = 1.43 in = 1.6in=1.43 in    @xmath16 , diverges for @xmath17 .",
    "the technical reason of this failure@xcite is that the weak coupling expansion parameter is @xmath18 .",
    "the high - frequency cutoff sets the characteristic time scale @xmath19 of the noise , thus problems are encountered for slow noise , @xmath20 , since the qubit becomes sensitive to details of the dynamics of the environment .",
    "for instance it will distinguish rtn and gln having the same @xmath21 .",
    "indeed suppose we average the signal from an ensemble of experiments identical , apart for the uncontrolled preparation of the environment .",
    "the effect of rtn due to a single bf is to determine two angular frequencies for the qubit , @xmath7 and @xmath22^{1/2}$ ] , and the signal will show beats at the frequency @xmath23 . if the bf is very slow , switches between the two frequencies produce decay with @xmath24",
    ". in this regime we can identify @xmath25 from the condition , @xmath26 is approximated by @xmath27 . thus at @xmath28 it can be translated in @xmath29  @xcite and the condition @xmath30 simply means that broadening as given by the weak coupling theory should be smaller than the qubit splitting . ] for beats to be observable , @xmath20 .",
    "instead for slow gln@xcite , a standard model in nmr@xcite , decay is determined by uncertainty in the preparation of the environment , an effect analogous to the `` rigid lattice line breadth''@xcite . by averaging the phase over a static distribution of the effective bias @xmath31",
    ", we find the decay of the qubit coherences @xmath32 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath33 is gaussian for gln , the standard deviation being @xmath34 .",
    "the decay depends on @xmath4 and it is slower for @xmath35 where for @xmath36 a simple integration yields @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath38 the full dynamic problem can be solved and @xmath39 . in both cases the signal amplitude",
    "is strongly reduced already at times @xmath40 giving an apparent decay time @xmath41 independent on @xmath42 and finite .",
    "differences between slow rtn and gln are also apparent in the line - shapes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rates0].c ) .",
    "decoherence due to discrete noise sources has been studied in ref.@xcite where the fluctuator has been modeled by a quantum impurity described by the fano anderson model . rather than study higher orders@xcite of the perturbative expansion in @xmath43 ,",
    "a different strategy has been used , namely one may write a master equation ( me ) for a four - level system system including the impurity level , which is traced out at the end of the calculation",
    ". thus fast components of the environment are effectively treated at the me level , whereas slow fluctuations are accounted for nonperturbatively . in practice one has at most to diagonalize a simple @xmath44 lindblad map which implies that the qubit dynamics is characterized by combining exponentials showing _ two _ relaxation times @xmath45 and _ two _ dephasing times @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rates].a ) .",
    "= 1.9in=1.56 in = 1.8in=1.56 in    if @xmath47 the dominant rates for @xmath48 coincide with the weak coupling ones ( and the classical gln ones ) and describe homogeneous broadening . instead for impurities with @xmath49 , both @xmath50",
    "are important since dephasing reflects the bistable nature of the slow environment .",
    "relaxation is not so sensitive : for @xmath36 , the dominant rate is the weak coupling one the other rate being @xmath51 .",
    "rates have the form @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 being the splitting between the two spectroscopic peaks induced by the bistable impurity@xcite .",
    "they can be found analytically in the full adiabatic regime @xmath55 , which includes the crossover region@xcite . in the stochastic limit for the bf dynamics @xmath56^{1/2}$ ] and",
    "@xmath57^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath58 is the induced angular splitting on the bloch sphere .",
    "features of the nature of the bf appear if @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 , this criterion for `` strong coupling '' depending on _ both _ @xmath61 and the operating point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rates].b ) . strongly coupled impurities are non - gaussian , and determine non - exponential decay .",
    "moreover their effect depends on their preparation , so they are non - stationary and non - markovian , determining memory effects . as a consequence decoherence depends on details of the protocols@xcite , a critical feature for @xmath0 noise .",
    "ideally quantum protocols assume we can measure individual members of an ensemble of identical ( meaning that preparation is controlled ) time evolutions of the qubit .",
    "the environment limits control of the preparation . at",
    "most one can recalibrate , for each individual member , the collective variable @xmath3 . with this feedback scheme error",
    "would be due solely to decoherence _ during _ time evolution . in actual experiments",
    "lack of control on the environment determines additional defocusing of the signal , analogous to inhomogeneous broadening in nmr@xcite , which depends on the statistics of the environment at appropriate low - frequencies@xcite .",
    "we model @xmath0 noise with a set of impurities switching at rates @xmath62 . for charge based devices",
    "they are coupled with the qubit via the total polarizing charge , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "the standard assumption@xcite of a distribution of @xmath62 with @xmath65 for @xmath66$]@xcite leads to the spectrum @xmath67 which is @xmath0 at frequencies @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "in other words , impurities with both large and small @xmath26 are present .",
    "decoherence for this model has been studied for @xmath69 , where exact solutions are available even for non - linear environments  @xcite .",
    "the feedback protocol results not to be sensitive to very slow impurities , having @xmath70 , which sets an effective intrinsic low - frequency cutoff @xmath71 .",
    "this effect is due to the nongaussianity of the environment , and to the fact that bfs with @xmath72 determine strong decay .",
    "instead bfs with @xmath73 behave as an environment of quantum harmonic oscillators , being sensitive only to the amplitude of noise @xmath74 . in absence of recalibration",
    ", inhomogeneous broadening corresponds to a proper averaging of the initial conditions of the bfs and one may prove that @xmath71 moves to @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the overall measurement time of the experiment and a large number of repetitions is assumed .",
    "the most effective implemented strategy@xcite for defeating @xmath0 is to tune optimally the working point , which in our case means setting @xmath77 .",
    "here the qubit splitting is less sensitive to bias fluctuations , or equivalently the lowest order adiabatic rate @xmath13 vanishes . in other words ,",
    "operating with @xmath4 modifies the parameters @xmath78 and the quantitative characterization of the spectrum in terms of @xmath71 , the main effect being that smaller @xmath78 means smaller effectiveness of noise . at first sight one",
    "expects that differences between a bf-@xmath0 environment and a set of oscillators with @xmath0 spectrum ( g-@xmath0 ) decrease by operating at @xmath35 , although they do not necessarily disappear@xcite .",
    "decoherence at the optimal point for a g-@xmath0 environment has been recently studied by makhlin and shnirman@xcite , combining the adiabatic approximation and diagrammatic perturbation theory .",
    "instead we study a bf-@xmath0 environment by solving numerically the stochastic schrdinger equation .",
    "we checked that very slow bfs are ineffective , so we choose @xmath79 .",
    "we consider first an adiabatic environment , @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2].a ) studying relaxation via @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting rate reproduces the weak coupling result , in both protocols with and without recalibration of the environment .",
    "instead dephasing is much faster and recalibration is able to reduce defocusing effects .",
    "inhomogeneous broadening can be estimated with the rigid lattice line breadth formula .",
    "if one assumes @xmath82 to be large enough that the initial @xmath83 is gaussian distributed , one finds @xmath84 , where physically @xmath85 .",
    "this simple result accounts for the initial reduction of the signal amplitude , and coincides with the short - time behavior of the diagrammatic theory@xcite .",
    "adding faster bfs to the environment increases relaxation more than dephasing .",
    "in our example ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2].b ) decoherence is limited by relaxation @xmath86 , this latter being due to the fast part of the spectrum @xmath87 .",
    "inhomogeneous broadening does not reduce drastically the amplitude and , as expected , dephasing is underestimated by adiabatic approaches  @xcite .",
    "finally , we show that even a single impurity on a @xmath0 background may cause a substantial reduction of the amplitude .",
    "this strongly poses the problem of reliability of charge based devices .",
    "effects of realistic bf distributions were pointed out by galperin et al.@xcite . using reasonable parameters",
    ", we obtain that indeed an additional bf has a substantial effect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ft ] ) , whose signature is an asymmetric fourier transform double - peak , which is similar to recent spectroscopy observations@xcite .      0 y. nakamura",
