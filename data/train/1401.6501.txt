    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite gives new insight for understanding strongly coupled gauge theories or strongly correlated condensed matter systems . in particular , high temperature superconductors in the framework of the ads / cft correspondence attract much attention .",
    "the simple model of holographic superconductors initiated in @xcite has been extended into more realistic models with inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "anisotropic models of superconductors also have been investigated in the context of p - wave superconductors , where a non - abelian gauge field condenses in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "since real - world superconductors exhibit various types of anisotropy , it will be valuable to consider other models of anisotropic holographic superconductors .",
    "we then consider in this paper the holographic model in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory analyzed in @xcite , where the bulk solution corresponding to the normal state was constructed .",
    "this work was motivated by the ir geometry , i.e. , the near - horizon geometry , of an asymptotically anti - de sitter  ( _ ads _ ) black _ brane _ spacetime , since the behavior of a holographic superconductor strongly depends on the ir geometry , as we see in the analyses of the fermi surface of a non - fermi liquid @xcite . while anisotropy in the ir geometry has been actively investigated also in the context of lifshitz geomerty @xcite , where anisotropy between time and space is considered",
    ", the anisotropy in @xcite is between two spatial directions induced by spatial dependence of the dilaton field , i.e. , the bianchi type @xcite .    in this paper , we construct the superconducting state in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory by turning on a charged scalar field , and analyze the effect of the anisotropy on the optical conductivity .",
    "it will be worthwhile mentioning here the difference between our model and the p - wave holographic model of superconductors @xcite . in our model , the bulk solution is anisotropic not only in the superconducting state but also in the normal state , as if the anisotropy arose due to structures of a superconductor , such as crystal structure and doping .",
    "in contrast , the anisotropy from the non - abelian gauge field vanishes in the normal state in the p - wave model of superconductors @xcite .",
    "we also point out that , in our model , the anisotropy is described by a parameter in the _ solution _ of the dilaton field and hence it is under our control , while the parameter of the anisotropy in @xcite is a coupling constant of the _ theory_. therefore , it seems natural to view our model as corresponding to a superconductor with the anisotropy due to crystal structure and doping .",

    "in this section , we numerically construct anisotropic black brane solutions in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory coupled to a charged scalar field @xmath0 . the solutions with a charged scalar hair correspond to a superconducting state in the dual field theory .",
    "when @xmath0 is identically zero , they are reduced to the solutions constructed in @xcite , which correspond to a normal state in the dual field theory .",
    "not only the normal state solutions , we construct here the superconducting state solutions .",

    "the field equations derived from the action take the following form @xmath4 where @xmath5    in order to make the definitions of physical quantities clear , here we start with the ansatz of the metric @xmath6 together with the forms of the gauge potential @xmath7 and the charged scalar field @xmath0 as @xmath8 which we assume describes an asymptotically ads black brane spacetime . then , we should have the asymptotic forms of the metric functions as @xmath9    the asymptotic behavior of the gauge potential and the charged scalar field is shown to take the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants .",
    "the constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the chemical potential and the charge density in the dual field theory , respectively . on the other hand , for the charged scalar field with the potential given in eq .",

    "we also introduce here the temperature normalized by the charge density @xmath12 as @xmath37 for later convenience .",
    "for the dilaton field @xmath2 , we make the ansatz @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "this is a simple way to consider spatial anisotropy in holographic models , which was originally used in @xcite . under this assumption , eq . is automatically satisfied .",
    "we note that this holographic model becomes isotropic if @xmath39 is zero .",
    "we now explain how to solve the field equations . in the coordinate system ,",
    "eqs .  are written as follows @xmath40 we note that the equations are invariant under the scale transformation @xmath41 which rescales the metric by @xmath42 . by employing this rescaling",

    ".    on the other hand , we assume that all the variables are sufficiently differentiable and @xmath50 vanishes at infinity .",
    "then , eq . requires @xmath51 since we are concerned with asymptotically ads solutions , we impose @xmath52 , or equivalently @xmath53 .",
    "the asymptotic solutions to the remaining equations are then derived as @xmath54 in order for the metric eq . to take the manifestly ads form , we need to require @xmath55 when we construct the family of solutions with a _",
    "fixed _ value of @xmath39 , it is not allowed to realize the condition by rescaling .",
    "it is because the rescaling of @xmath56 necessarily involves the rescaling of @xmath39 , which results in a family of solutions with different values of @xmath39 .",
    "hence , we impose the condition as the boundary condition at infinity .    for @xmath0 ,",
    "both of the two terms in are normalizable @xcite and we can impose the boundary condition that either one vanishes . in this paper , we focus on the case where @xmath13 vanishes . furthermore ,",
    "in the numerical calculations below , we consider solutions with the normalized temperature @xmath57 fixed .",
    "we then need to impose the boundary condition at infinity on the gauge potential @xmath58 such that eq .",
    "is satisfied for a fixed @xmath57 .",

    "the charged scalar field @xmath0 plays the role of the order parameter",
    ". a normal state of the dual field theory corresponds to the only solution to eqs .  with @xmath60 , which occurs when the temperature @xmath21 is higher than a certain temperature @xmath61 . on the other hand , when @xmath62 , there emerges a solution with @xmath63 , and it corresponds to a superconducting state .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 is identified with the critical temperature of the dual field theory . here",
    "we analyze the properties associated with the superconducting states , which include the critical temperature , the condensate of @xmath0 , and the horizon area .",
    "first we determine the critical temperature .",
    "to do so , we construct background solutions with @xmath64 by restricting to @xmath65 in eq . , which we have confirmed is numerically consistent with the perturbed solution studied in @xcite .",
    "we then consider perturbation on the background solutions and analyze whether a hair , i.e. , non - trivial configuration of @xmath0 , can reside on it . as in the isotropic case @xcite",
    ", we expect that the superconducting phase transition is second - order , as actually confirmed below .",
    "then , we define the inifinitesimal parameter @xmath66 as @xmath67 and write @xmath0 , near the phase transition point , @xmath68 since the backreaction of @xmath69 onto the metric and the gauge potential is second order in @xmath66 , we only have to solve @xmath70 on the background solution with @xmath64 , in order to determine the critical temperature @xmath61 ( @xmath71 ) . as we saw in sec .",

    "we then regard eq . as an eigenvalue equation with the eigenvalue being @xmath74 .",
    "we solve it on a _ fixed _ background solution , and identify the critical temperature as the temperature of the background , and @xmath74 is _ derived _ as the lowest eigenvalue . since the only free parameter in eq .",

    "[ fig : critical_temperature ] the critical temperature normalized by the charge density , @xmath79 , for various values of the anisotropic parameter @xmath39 .",
    "we find that for a fixed @xmath12 , @xmath61 monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath39 .",
    "it has been reported in @xcite recently that an iron - based superconductor has the same property in the sense that anisotropy lowers the critical temperature .",
    "we note , however , that the anisotropy in @xcite is between the vertical and parallel directions with respect to the layered superconductor , in contrast to our holographic model , where we consider the anisotropy within the layered superconductor ( the @xmath56-@xmath80 plane ) .",
    "next we investigate the behavior of the condensate of the charged scalar field @xmath0 . according to the ads / cft dictionary , we can read off the value of the condensate @xmath81 as @xmath82 where @xmath14 is defined in eq . .",
    "thus , now we let @xmath83 in eq .",
