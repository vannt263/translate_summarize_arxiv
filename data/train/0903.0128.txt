    "see bai ( 1999)@xcite , bose and sen ( 2007)@xcite and bose , sen and gangopadhyay ( 2009)@xcite for description of several interesting situations where the lsd exists and can be explicitly specified .",

    "our convention will be to start the row and column indices from zero .",
    "thus , the @xmath53th row of @xmath54 is @xmath55 for @xmath56 , the @xmath57-th row of @xmath1 is a right - circular shift of the @xmath58-th row by @xmath0 positions ( equivalently , @xmath59 positions )",

    "our goal is to study the lsd and the distributional limit of the spectral radius of suitably scaled @xmath0-circulant matrices @xmath62 when the input sequence @xmath63 consists of i.i.d",
    ".  random variables .",
    "one of the usefulness of circulant matrix stems from its deep connection to toeplitz matrix - while the former has an explicit and easy - to - state formula of its spectral decomposition , the spectral analysis of the latter is much harder and challenging in general .",
    "if the input @xmath64 is square summable , then the circulant approximates the corresponding toeplitz in various senses with the growing dimension .",
    "indeed , this approximating property is exploited to obtain the lsd of the toeplitz matrix as the dimension increases .",
    "see gray ( 2006)@xcite for a recent and relatively easy account .    when the input sequence is i.i.d . with positive variance",
    ", then it loses the square summability . in that case , while the lsd of the ( symmetric ) circulant is normal ( see bose and mitra ( 2002)@xcite and massey , miller and sinsheimer ( 2007)@xcite ) , the lsd of the ( symmetric ) toeplitz is nonnormal ( see bryc , dembo and jiang ( 2006)@xcite and hammond and miller ( 2005)@xcite )    on the other hand , consider the random symmetric band toeplitz matrix , where the banding parameter @xmath65 , which essentially is a measure of the number of nonzero entries , satisfies @xmath66 and @xmath67 . then again , its spectral distribution is approximated well by the corresponding banded symmetric circulant . see for example kargin ( 2009)@xcite and bose and basak ( 2009)@xcite .",
    "similarly , the lsd of the @xmath68-circulant was derived in bose and mitra ( 2002)@xcite ) ( who called it the reverse circulant matrix ) .",
    "this has been used in the study of symmetric band hankel matrices .",
    "see bose and basak ( 2009)@xcite .",
    "the circulant matrices are diagonalized by the fourier matrix @xmath69 .",
    "their eigenvalues are the discrete fourier transform of the input sequence @xmath70 and are given by @xmath71 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the circulant matrices crop up crucially in time series analysis .",
    "for example , the periodogram of a sequence @xmath72 is defined as @xmath73 , @xmath74 and is a simple function of the eigenvalues of the corresponding circulant matrix .",
    "the study of the properties of periodogram is fundamental in the spectral analysis of time series .",
    "see for instance fan and yao ( 2003)@xcite . the maximum of the perdiogram , in particular , has been studied in mikosch ( 1999)@xcite",
    ".    the @xmath0-circulant matrix and its block versions arise in many different areas of mathematics and statistics - from multi - level supersaturated design of experiment ( georgiou and koukouvinos ( 2006 ) @xcite ) to spectra of de bruijn graphs ( strok ( 1992)@xcite ) and @xmath75-matrix solutions to @xmath76 ( wu , jia and li ( 2002 ) @xcite ) - just to name a few .",
    "see also the book by davis ( 1979)@xcite and the article by pollock ( 2002)@xcite . the @xmath0-circulant matrices with random input sequence are examples of so called ` patterned ' matrices .",

    "see for example the review article by bai ( 1999)@xcite or the more recent bose and sen ( 2008)@xcite and also bose , sen and gangopadhyay ( 2009)@xcite ) .",

    "it seems interesting to investigate the possible lsds that may arise from @xmath0-circulants .",
    "likewise , the limit distributions of the spectral radius of circulant and the @xmath68-circulant are both gumbel .",
    "it seems natural to ask what happens to the distributional limit of the spectral radius for general @xmath0-circulants .",
    "the lsds for @xmath0-circulant matrices are known for a few important special cases .",

    "input having finite second moment , the lsd is real normal , ( bose and sen ( 2007)@xcite ) . for the @xmath0-circulant with @xmath79 ,",
    "the lsd is the symmetric version of the positive square root of the exponential variable with mean one ( bose and mitra ( 2002)@xcite ) .",
    "clearly , for many combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath51 , a lot of eigenvalues are zero .",
    "later we provide a formula solution for the eigenvalues . from this ,",
    "if @xmath0 is prime and @xmath80 where @xmath81 , then @xmath53 is an eigenvalue with multiplicity @xmath82 . to avoid this degeneracy and to keep our exposition simple ,",
    "we primarily restrict our attention to the case when @xmath83 .    in general , the structure of the eigenvalues depend on the number theoretic relation between @xmath0 and @xmath51 and the lsd may vary widely . in particular , lsd is not ` continuous ' in @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , while the esd of usual circulant matrices @xmath84 is bivariate normal , the esd of 2-circulant matrices @xmath85 for @xmath51 large odd number looks like a solar ring ( see figure  [ fig : case3&4 ] ) .",
    "the next theorem tells us that the radial component of the lsd of @xmath0-circulants with @xmath86 is always degenerate , at least when the input sequence is i.i.d .",

    "therefore , by applying bernstein s inequality and simplifying , for some constant @xmath689 , @xmath690 further , @xmath691 combining the above estimates finishes the proof .",
    "first assume that @xmath51 is even",
    ". then @xmath0 must be odd and @xmath692 .",
    "thus with the previous notation , @xmath693 since @xmath694 and @xmath695 , by chebyshev inequality , we have @xmath696 thus finding the limiting distribution @xmath697 is asymptotically equivalent to finding the limiting distribution of @xmath698 .",
    "clearly , this is also true if @xmath51 is odd as that case is even simpler .",

    "standard normal .",
    "let @xmath699 be i.i.d .",
    "standard exponentials . by lemma  [ lem : product ]",

    ", there exists @xmath711 such that @xmath712 consequently , @xmath713 .",

    "since by lemma [ lem : maxima ] , @xmath731 it follows that @xmath732 and consequently , @xmath733 in view of lemma [ lem : trunc ] , it now suffices to show that @xmath734 we use the basic inequality @xmath735 to obtain @xmath736 where , for any sequence of random variables @xmath737 , @xmath738 as a trivial consequence of theorem 2.1 of davis and mikosch ( 1999)@xcite , we have @xmath739 together with @xmath740 they imply that @xmath741 from the inequality @xmath742 it easily follows that @xmath743 this completes the proof of theorem [ theo : max ] .",
    "to establish the lsd of @xmath0-circulants for more general subsequential choices of @xmath744 , a much more comprehensive study of the orbits of the translation operator acting on the ring @xmath745 by @xmath746 is required .",
    "in particular , one may perhaps first establish an asymptotic negligibility criteria similar to that given in lemma  [ lem : fkn ] . then , along the line similar to that of the proofs of theorems  [ theo : lsd12 ] and [ theo : lsd45 ] - first using the abundant independence structure among the eigenvalues of the @xmath0-circulant matrices when the input sequence is i.i.d .",
    "normals as given in lemma  [ lem : product ] and then claiming universality through an appropriate use of the invariance principle .",
    "what particularly complicates matters is that in general there _ may _ be contributing classes of several sizes as opposed to only one ( of size @xmath310 or @xmath9 ) that we saw in theorems  [ theo : lsd12 ] and [ theo : lsd45 ] respectively .",
    "thus it is also interesting to investigate whether we can select @xmath747 in a relatively simple way so that there exist finitely many positive integers @xmath748 with @xmath749 where @xmath750 . in that case",
    "the lsd would be an attractive mixture distribution .",
    "establishing the limit distribution of the spectral radius for general subsequential choices of @xmath744 appears to be even more challenging .",
    "in fact , even under the set up of theorems  [ theo : lsd12 ] and [ theo : lsd45 ] , this seems to be a nontrivial problem . as a first step",
    ", one needs to find max - domain of attraction for @xmath751 where @xmath105 are i.i.d .  exponentials which requires a detailed understanding of the behaviour of @xmath752 as @xmath555 . when @xmath753 , we were unable to locate any results on this .",
    "our preliminary investigation shows that this is fairly involved and we are currently working on this problem .",
    "moreover , an extra layer of difficulty arises while dealing with the spectral radius out of the fact that we can not immediately ignore some ` bad ' classes of eigenvalues whose proportions are asymptotically negligible like we did while establishing the lsd .",
