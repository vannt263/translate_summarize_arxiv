    "application of theory of nonlinear dynamics , especially chaos theory , in economics and financial systems was first suggested by may and beddington in 1975  @xcite . from that moment",
    "researchers found chaotic behaviour in various existing models and recently a new models with very complex dynamic are being created .",
    "examples are the forced van der pol model  @xcite , kaldorian model  @xcite , is - lm model  @xcite , goodwin s accelerator model  @xcite and huang  li nonlinear financial model  @xcite , to cite just a few .",
    "recently the last model , mostly refereed as a `` chaotic finance system '' , is intensively studied .",
    "it is described by the following three - dimensional system @xmath3 where @xmath2 are time - dependent variables and @xmath1 are real non - negative parameters . here",
    "@xmath4 represents the interest rate , @xmath5 is the investment demand , @xmath6 is the price index .",
    "parameters @xmath1 denote saving amount , cost per investment and elasticity demand of commercial markets , respectively .",
    "the complex behaviour of the system   has been noted first by ma and chen in 2001  @xcite .",
    "then , variety of the papers were published where the dynamics of this model was investigated by means the various methods and techniques such as : lyapunov exponents and bifurcation diagrams  @xcite ; synchronizations with linear and nonlinear feedbacks  @xcite , adaptive  @xcite , sliding mode  @xcite and passive  @xcite control methods  @xcite ; control via linear , speed and time - delay feedbacks  @xcite .",
    "to get an idea about the complexity of the system we made several poincar cross sections .",
    "this technique is based on simply intersections of trajectories with a suitably chosen plane of section . as a result",
    "we obtain a pattern on plane formed from intersection points of phase curves with the intersection plane , that is easy to visualize and interpret .",
    "( a ) showing fractals structure.[fig:4],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] ( a ) showing fractals structure.[fig:4],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in figuers  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:3 ]",
    "we show such sections .",
    "they were generated for certain values of parameters @xmath1 .",
    "the cross - section planes are specified as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the coordinates on these planes are @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] presents first section and the magnification around its centre .",
    "surprisingly , even for zeroth values of the parameters , the system reveals very rich dynamics",
    ". we can detect three types of motion : periodic , quasi - periodic and chaotic , see figs .  [",
    "fig : stable ] and  [ fig : quasi ] presenting periodic and quasi periodic solutions .",
    "in fact the poincar section visible in figure  [ fig:1 ] is similar to those for conservative systems . whereas figure  [ fig:3 ] posses totally different structure . for chosen values of parameters given in captions in figure  [ fig:3 ] ,",
    "we obtain shapely elegant strange attractors of the fractal structure , i.e. , their posses the hidden layers structure preserving self - similarity , see figure  [ fig:4 ] showing magnifications of the right - bottom region of the figure  [ fig:3](a ) .",
    "the complex behaviour of this model apparent from the poincar cross sections as well as previously mentioned methods and techniques , suggests its non - integrability .",
    "but these numerical signs of non - integrability were obtained only for chosen values of parameters .",
    "the high sensitivity of chaotic systems to change the initial conditions makes it impossible to predict the effects of economic decisions in the long time scale .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to ask whether there exists any set of values of parameters for which this system is integrable .",
    "it is very important question from the economical point of view to avoid undesirable trajectories and make the precise economic prediction possible .",
    "however , it is technically impossible to make the numerical analysis for all values of parameters . for finding integrable cases one needs a strong tool to distinguish values of parameters",
    "for which the system is suspected to be integrable .",
    "for hamiltonian systems for which we have a precise notion of integrability , i.e. , integrability in the liouville sense , there are many approaches to the integrability studies : hamilton - jacobi theory , normal forms , perturbation theory , splitting of separateness and recently , the morales  ramis theory based on the differential galois approach . whereas for non - hamiltonian systems there is no so many approaches .",
    "it is due to the fact that for non - hamiltonian systems there is no a commonly accepted definition of the integrability thus , we should first specify what , in the considered context , the integrability means .    for a given @xmath10-dimensional system @xmath11 by b - integrability",
    "we understand the existence of @xmath12 functionally independent first integrals @xmath13 , and @xmath14 symmetries , i.e. , vector fields @xmath15 such that @xmath16=0 , \\quad \\text{and}\\quad   { { \\boldsymbol}{w}}_j[f_i]=0,\\quad \\text{for}\\quad 1\\leq i\\leq k,\\quad 1\\leq j\\leq n - k.\\ ] ] then we say that the system is integrable by quadrature .    in this definition",
    ", the second condition means that functions @xmath13 are common first integrals of vector fields @xmath17 .",
    "it can be shown that if a system   is b - integrable , then it is integrable by quadrature .",
    "that is , all its solutions can be obtained by means of finite sequence of algebraic operations and calculations of primitive functions .",
    "the aim of this letter is to check whether there exist any set of values of parameters @xmath1 for which the system   is integrable .",
    "the main result is formulated in the following theorem .",
    "[ th:1 ] huang  li nonlinear financial model   is not b - integrable in the class of meromorphic functions of variables @xmath2 for all real values of parameters @xmath1 .    to prove this theorem we investigate variational equations along a particular solution and we study their differential galois group .",
    "this approach of finding necessary conditions for integrability in a framework of differential galois theory was mostly used in the context of hamiltonian systems .",
    "it is described by morales  ramis theory .",
    "thanks to this approach many new integrable cases were detected , see e.g. ,  @xcite . for a general introduction to differential galois theory as well as morales ",
    "ramis theory please consult the papers  @xcite .",
    "although the system   is not a hamiltonian , some parts of of the described differential galois approach to its integrability study can be adopted .",
    "the key implication is following .",
    "if a system   has functionally independent meromorphic first integral , then the differential galois group of variational equations along a particular non - equilibrium solution has a rational invariant .",
    "the first applications of the differential galois theory to non - hamiltonian systems the interested reader can find in  @xcite .    originally , the morales  ramis theory was formulated for hamiltonian systems for which we identify integrability as the integrability the liouville sense . however ,",
    "if we restrict ourself to b - integrability , then we have a elegant generalization of this theory .",
    "namely , with the system   we can also consider its cotangent lift , i.e. , a hamiltonian system defined in @xmath18 with the following hamiltonian function @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are canonical coordinates defined in a symplectic manifold @xmath22 . in a recent paper  @xcite ayoul and zung shown that if the original system   is integrable , then the lifted system generated by the function   is integrable in the liouville sense .",
    "hence , for both hamiltonian and non - hamiltonian systems , we have the same necessary integrability condition , i.e. , the identity component of the differential galois group of variational equations must be abelian .",
    "we summarize the above facts by the following theorem that gives necessary integrability conditions for non - hamiltonian systems .",
    "( ayoul  zung ) [ th : zung ] assume that the system   is meromorphically b - integrable , then the identity component of the differential galois group of variational equations along a particular non - equlibrium solution is abelian .",
    "the system   possess the invariant manifold @xmath23 indeed , equations   restricted to @xmath24 read @xmath25 hence solving this equations , we obtain our particular solution @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27^t$ ] denotes the variations of @xmath28^t$ ] , then the first order variational equations along @xmath29 take the form @xmath30 where the matrix @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 since the particular solution corresponds to a motion along @xmath5-axis , the equations for @xmath33 and @xmath34 form a subsystem of the normal variational equations that can be rewritten as a one second order differential equation @xmath35 next , by means of the change of the independent variable @xmath36 and using chain formulae for transformation of derivatives @xmath37 we can rewrite equation   as @xmath38 where prime denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "the explicit form of the coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the following @xmath41 the classical change of the dependent variable @xmath42,\\ ] ] transforms   into its reduced form @xmath43 with coefficient @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 in equation   with the coefficient @xmath44 given above we immediately recognize the whittaker equation @xmath47 with @xmath48 this equation has one regular singularity at @xmath49 and one irregular at @xmath50 .    here",
    "we should underline one significant fact .",
    "namely , the respective transformations   and   change in general a whole differential galois group of variational equations  .",
    "however , the clue is that they do not affect to the identity component of the group , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "thus , according to the theorem  [ th : zung ] , in order to prove a non - integrability of our original nonlinear system   it is enough to show that the identity component of the differential galois group @xmath51 of variational equations   and thus its rationalized - reduced form   is not abelian .",
    "necessary conditions for abelianity of the identity component of the differential galois group of the whittaker equation are the following .",
    "[ th : th2 ] the identity component of the galois group of the whittaker equation   is abelian if and only if the numbers @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 belong to @xmath54 .    for details",
    "see subsection 2.8.3 given in  @xcite .",
    "according to this theorem the numbers @xmath52 are integer such that one of them is positive and other negative .",
    "thus , its product @xmath55 should be always negative . in our case , however , it is easy to verify that this condition can not be satisfied .",
    "namely , for @xmath56 given in  , we obtain the following equality @xmath57 which can not be fulfilled for @xmath58 .",
    "this ends the proof .",
    "although the obstructions to integrability obtained by means of analysis of differential galois group of variational equations are one of the strongest known , the frequent obstacle in its applications is finding a particular non - equilibrium solution for a given dynamical system .",
    "even though it is a some limitation , it is weaker than many of the assumptions required in other methods and the result of application of this method is a non - integrability proof of the considered system finally ending its analysis . furthermore , if the system depends on certain parameters ( e.g. masses , parameters describing the forces acting on the system ) , then usually we can prove its non - integrability for almost all values of parameters except some finite set of values . in this way the new integrable cases can be found .",
    "we shown the application of this approach on the example of intensively studied nonlinear financial model  .",
    "we proved that this particular system is not integrable in the class of functions meromorphic in variables @xmath2 for all values of parameters @xmath1 .",
    "however , it seems that many others different economical and financial models are waiting for such kind of analysis .",
    "it is an open problem .",
