    "the shortest period at which neutron stars ( nss ) have been observed ( @xmath1 ms ) is suspiciously close to the detection capabilities of pulsar ( psr ) surveys carried out so far .",
    "a new experiment at the northern cross at medicina has started recently whose sensitivity in the range @xmath2 ms is significantly better than that of the previous surveys ( damico et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the experiment is aimed at determining whether @xmath3 is indeed a physical limit or is of instrumental origin .    the minimum period of a stable",
    ", gravitationally bound ns is thought to be within @xmath4 ms ( for the softest equation of state of dense matter ) and @xmath5 ms ( for the stiffest one ) .",
    "these are the limits derived by cook , shapiro & teukolsky ( 1994a ; cst hereafter ) in the context of a recycling scenario where accretion occurs from the inner edge of a keplerian disk onto a bare unmagnetized ns .",
    "remarkably , submillisecond periods are attained ( before the mass - shedding instability is encountered ) even in those models having a static maximum mass close to @xmath6 .",
    "several authors ( phinney & kulkarni 1994 ; stergioulas & friedman 1995 ; burderi & damico 1997 ) discussed the importance of detecting an ultra - rapid rotating pulsar as a way of discriminating between the proposed equations of state ( eoss ) .",
    "the formation of a very fast spinning pulsar , however , depends sensitively on the history of the ns in the binary and on the evolution of the magnetic field which controls the dynamics of mass and angular momentum transfer at the magnetospheric boundary . whilst detailed evolutionary calculations by urpin , geppert & konenkov ( 1997 ) have shown that nss move into the millisecond region of the plane @xmath7 ( magnetic moment versus period ) under rather `` ordinary '' conditions , the possibility of populating the submillisecond range is still unknown .",
    "though , on theoretical grounds , bare nss can attain periods @xmath8 ms ( cst ) , nature may not provide the conditions for spinning a significant number of nss to ultra short periods .    in this letter",
    "we investigate the efficiency of the recycling process in producing nss in the yet unexplored region of the @xmath7 diagram below @xmath0 ms . to this end",
    ", we simulate the distribution of a ns population evolved assuming three models for the magnetic field decay and selecting two representative eoss .",
    "in our statistical analysis the nss evolve in low mass binaries and undergo four phases ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) : _ ejector _",
    "@xmath9 _ accretor _",
    "@xmath9 _ pulsar .",
    "_    during the ejector phase ,",
    "the stellar wind from the companion star is blown away by the strong radiation pressure of the young pulsar , and the ns spins down only via magnetic dipole radiation at a rate @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the rotation period in seconds and @xmath12 is the magnetic moment in units of @xmath13 g. this phase continues until the ram pressure of the stellar wind starts exceeding the pulsar momentum flux at the accretion radius .",
    "thereafter , matter penetrates down to the magnetosphere whose radius is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the neutron star mass in solar masses and @xmath16 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath17yr@xmath18 ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) . in this phase ,",
    "the intervening plasma and the ns can exchange angular momentum . as a guideline",
    ", we assume that the ns is fed through a disc that develops due to roche  lobe overflow in the low  mass binary .",
    "the disc has an inner radius @xmath19 , where the dimensionless constant @xmath20 is derived following burderi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : @xmath21 with @xmath22 the sakura - sunyaev parameterization of the viscosity .",
    "the rate of transfer of angular momentum @xmath23 at the inner boundary of the disc can be evaluated as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the keplerian angular velocity at @xmath26 the dimensionless torque @xmath27 function of the fastness parameter @xmath28 determines the direction of angular momentum transfer , and vanishes at a certain critical value @xmath29 .    denoting with @xmath30 the ns angular momentum ( with @xmath31 the moment of inertia ) , we use the balance relation @xmath32 to derive the evolution of the angular velocity @xmath33 of the neutron star .",
    "when @xmath34 is negative the ns magnetosphere acts as a centrifugal barrier at @xmath35 . in this phase ( _ propeller _ ) ,",
    "the infalling plasma is forced into super keplerian rotation and is swept away , extracting angular momentum from the compact object which spins down . later in the evolution , when @xmath34 becomes positive ( _ accretion phase _ ) the ns spins up .",
    "we adopt two different expressions for @xmath34 , to bracket uncertainties , according to the models of ghosh & lamb ( 1991 ) and wang ( 1996 ) .",
    "when mass transfer from the companion stops , the ns shines as a _ pulsar _ , and suffers secular spin down by magnetic dipole torques ( eq . [ 1 ] ) .",
    "in this terminal phase , potential submillisecond pulsars migrate to the right of the @xmath7 diagram , and may in principle evacuate the region of interest to our experiment .",
    "the equation of state for nuclear matter determines the internal structure of a ns of given mass and angular velocity .",
    "both these quantities vary during the recycling process in a binary system : in order to account for the related evolution of @xmath36 and @xmath37 we used fits to the relativistic models calculated by cook , shapiro & teukolsky ( 1994b ) .    for a bare neutron star of @xmath6 , at the onset of recycling ,",
    "all viable eoss allow for terminal periods @xmath38 ms .",
    "however , the minimum period attainable depends on the specific eos .",
    "we focused on two eoss , labeled as a and l by arnett & bowers ( 1977 ) , bracketing the set of the limiting periods ; @xmath39 ms for eos a , and @xmath40 ms for eos l. a is soft , with a maximum static mass of @xmath41 and a static radius ( for a @xmath42 star ) of @xmath43 km .",
    "eos l is much stiffer , with a maximum static mass of @xmath44 and a static radius of @xmath45 km for the canonical mass .",
    "both models reach the mass - shedding limit with a modest rotational to gravitational energy ratio .",
    "this suggests that nonaxisymmetric instabilities are of no obstacle to recycling ( cst ) and so we neglect their possible influence on the evolution .    in the accretion model of cst , the centrifugal instability sets in when the accreted mass reaches about @xmath46 as an example , in the case of eos a",
    ", a @xmath42-neutron star can load @xmath47 before mass shedding disruption , with a final gravitational mass of @xmath48 , higher than the static limit .",
    "such an effect enhances the maximum attainable spin rate of a recycled pulsar . in the simulation , we thus allow for a total accreted mass of about @xmath49 for eos a , and of 0.5 ( or 1.0 ) @xmath50 for eos l ( still compatible with the stability calculations of cst ) .",
    "the observations of low magnetic moments ( @xmath51 g@xmath52 g ) in many binary and millisecond pulsars raises the problem of how the surface magnetic field can decay from the typical value of the isolated pulsar population ( @xmath53 g ) .",
    "an original suggestion of taam & van den heuvel ( 1986 ) prompted the development of a series of semi - empirical models , in which the fractional decay of the magnetic moment is related to the amount of mass accreted by the ns ( shibazaki et al .",
    "this picture appears to be probably too simplified ( wijers 1997 , but see van den heuvel & bitzaraki 1995 ) and other quantities ( such as @xmath54 ) are needed to explain the observation .",
    "we explored three different physical models for the surface field decay .",
    "the first model was proposed by konar & battacharya ( kb hereafter ; 1997 ) , following an idea by geppert & urpin ( 1994 ) . in this model ,",
    "the accreting plasma heats , initially , the crust reducing the time - scale for ohmic diffusion .",
    "as the original crustal material is conveyed towards higher conductivity region , ohmic decay slows down until the field freezes ( when the current layers are completely assimilated into the ns super - conducting core ) . as a result ,",
    "the amount of magnetic moment decay depends not only on the total mass accreted , but also on @xmath54 .",
    "in particular higher accretion rates determine a precocious freezing of the field , which relaxes to a higher bottom value .",
    "we use the same field decay profiles presented in kb extrapolating them also to values of @xmath55 ( brown & bildstein 1998 ) .",
    "figures 5 and 6 of kb refer to evolution for an intermediate eos : as field decay depends on the properties of the crust , we tested the sensitivity of the results introducing a correction factor to the magnitude of the relic field for eos a ( higher value ) and for eos l ( lower value ) , to mimic the effect of a thinner crust for a and thicker for l. additional corrections ( e.g. , thermal history of the crust ) could play a role but are difficult to include quantitatively .",
    "this point deserves future study .      in burderi ,",
    "king & wynn ( 1996 ) the magnetic moment decay is caused by an ordered accretion onto the polar caps of the compact object .",
    "matter accreted at the inner radius of the disc in the form of diamagnetic plasma blobs develops induced currents in its impact onto the magnetic poles .",
    "these currents can partially neutralize the ns crustal currents , weakening the magnetic moment of the star . under simplifying assumptions ,",
    "it is possible to derive a law for the magnetic field evolution : @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath58 the decay stops and the related bottom magnetic moment is : @xmath59      another class of models involves the spin history of the ns to drive evolution of the field residing initially in the core ( srinivasan et al . 1990 ; ding , chen & chau 1993 ; miri 1996 ) .",
    "as the ns spins down , the inter - pinning between the proton flux tubes and the superfluid neutron vortex lines drags the fluxoids ( carrying the core field @xmath60 ) towards the crust , where the magnetic flux undergoes ohmic diffusion : the surface field @xmath61 then relaxes to the value of the residual core field on a time - scale @xmath62 . in the simplest version of the model , when @xmath63 the fields evolve according to : @xmath64 where @xmath62 is set equal to @xmath65 yr",
    "the statistical analysis of the simulated population is carried out using a monte carlo technique .",
    "approximately 1,000 points are needed to grant stability .",
    "the distributions of the physical parameters selected at the onset of evolution are described in table 1 .",
    "we fixed an initial gravitational mass of @xmath66 the initial spin period is selected from a flat probability distribution among @xmath67 s , and it turned out that the simulations are quite insensitive to the exact range of the initial values of @xmath11 . to emulate the distribution of the magnetic moment we adopt the gaussian profile from bhattacharya et al .",
    "( 1992 ) which , at present , is the best representation of the observed @xmath68    evolutionary calculations for the low - mass binaries suggest an ejector phase lasting between @xmath69 yr ( miri & bhattacharya 1994 ) which is accompanied by negligible spontaneous decay of the magnetic field .",
    "the propeller phase affects the final statistics only in the sif model for which we mimic the spin - down effect introducing a mass transfer rate with mean value @xmath70 .",
    "the efficiency factor for angular momentum extraction is chosen according to the value suggested by miri ( 1996 ) . during the propeller phase",
    "the orbital parameters are unaffected by the binary evolution and so the rate of mass propelled is kept constant .    as regard to the accretion rates",
    "@xmath71 during the spin up phase , we select an interval compatible with the observations of lmxbs , whose typical luminosities cluster around @xmath72 . in a real binary system",
    "the accretion rates are not constant .",
    "however , during the accretion phase the mass transfer rate reaches a steady state after a time ( urpin & geppert 1996 ) remarkably shorter ( @xmath73 yr ) than the typical duration of this evolutionary stage in the lmxb ( @xmath74 yr ) .",
    "we allow for a total accreted mass @xmath75 greater than @xmath76 and smaller than the maximum value permitted by the eos ( see @xmath77 ) .",
    "the duration of the accretion phase is determined combining @xmath78 and @xmath75 , and can never exceed @xmath79 yr . to test the dependence of the results on @xmath75 and indirectly on the mass of the companion star we also considered different boundary values .",
    "when accretion ends , the ns spins down by dipole torque for a time determined by a flat distribution among @xmath80 yr .",
    "a longer pulsar phase does not modify the outcomes .",
    "the results of our simulations are summarized in figure 1 , where we give the fraction of synthesized objects for eos a and l in the 4 selected regions of the @xmath81 plane .",
    "this fraction is derived normalizing the sample to the total number of pulsars spinning with a period @xmath82 ms . as a guideline",
    ", the upper left number in each cross represents the relative percentage of objects having @xmath83 g(nowadays the minimum value detected in the observed population of millisecond pulsars ) and a period @xmath84 ms ( the minimum value observed ) . the typical variance is about @xmath85 for the upper two quadrants of the cross .",
    "we find that _ nss with periods below @xmath0 _ ms _ are present in a statistically significant number _ , both in kb and blob models . as regard to the sensitivity of the results on the adopted parameters",
    ", we did not encounter major statistical differences when varying the torque function @xmath86 the percentage of ultra rapid spinning psrs is strongly depressed only when the relic magnetic field is an order of magnitude greater than that calculated in konar & bhattacharya ( 1997 ) .    as an illustration of the results of our runs , figure 2 plots @xmath87 versus @xmath11 for kb ( top ) , blob and sif ( for eos a ) .",
    "the first two scenarios give quite similar distributions below @xmath88 s , whilst in sif model , the population cluster between @xmath89 s , leaving the region below @xmath0 ms devoid of objects . in the blob model ,",
    "nss with relatively high @xmath87 and long period populate the plane and this is a consequence of equation ( 6 ) predicting a bottom field higher than that found in kb , for the same @xmath54 .",
    "\\(a ) the efficiency of the recycling process in spinning the nss to the ultrashort periods can reach values as high as @xmath90 .",
    "_ this is the first indication that a tail in the distribution of the millisecond nss may exist , at periods shorter than those effectively searched so far_. our results provide an estimate of the relative importance of such a tail with respect to the bulk of the known millisecond psrs .",
    "\\(b ) as regard to the issue on the eos , only in the blob scenario the distributions of ultra rapidly spinning psrs enable us to discriminate between the eos a and l. in the kb model , they are almost indistinguishable .",
    "a more pronounced difference in the distributions is found when we limit @xmath75 to 0.5@xmath50 for eos l ( @xmath91 for the left upper quadrant of kb model to contrast with the estimate of @xmath92 for @xmath93 ) .",
    "\\(c ) in the millisecond range , the distribution of @xmath94 privileges values @xmath95 .",
    "this comes from the hypothesis that the present millisecond pulsars evolved from the low mass x - ray binary population , with typical observed accretion rates @xmath78 clustering around @xmath96 if future observations will be in favor of low values of @xmath87 , it will be suggestive of the presence of a yet undetected population of low luminosity low mass binaries .",
    "\\(d ) pulsar search experiments with a sensitivity profile almost flat in the ultrashort period range , like the new one in progress at the northern cross radiotelescope ( damico et al .",
    "1997 ) , are strongly encouraged , as they might help putting constraints on the equation of state and on the evolutionary paths of recycled neutron stars .",
