    "we focus on a setup consisting of a lateral dqd , which is coupled to the source and the drain electrodes , and measured by a nearby qpc [ see figure  1(a ) ] .",
    "the lateral dqd is formed by properly tuning the voltages applied to the corresponding gates .",
    "here we consider a coulomb - blockade regime with strong intradot and interdot coulomb interactions , so that only one electron is allowed in the dqd system .",
    "the states of the dqd are represented by the occupation states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , denoting one electron in the left and the right dots , respectively [ see figure  1(b ) ] .",

    "@xmath24 gives the tunneling - coupling hamiltonian between the dqd and the two electrodes where the counting operator @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) decreases ( increases ) the number of electrons that have tunneled into the right electrode ( via the barrier between the dqd and the right electrode)@xcite .",
    "these counting operators are introduced to keep track of the progress of the tunneling processes by successive electrons .",
    "finally , @xmath27 describes tunnelings in the qpc which depends on the electron occupation of the dqd , owing to electrostatic couplings between the dqd and the qpc .",

    "the derivative of the cumulant generating function with respect to the counting field @xmath37 at @xmath38 yields the @xmath39-th cumulant , i.e. , @xmath40 , where @xmath37 is a field conjugate to @xmath33 ( see , e.g. , ref .  2 ) .",

    "30 , so that the qpc conductance changes by @xmath101 if the number of electrons in the dqd changes by one@xcite .      in order to obtain some compact analytical results for the counting statistics ,",
    "we first consider , for simplicity , the resonance case where energy difference between two single - dot levels is zero ( i.e. , @xmath102 ) .",
    "for instance , the charge current through the dqd is obtained as @xmath103and shot noise is @xmath104where@xmath105@xmath106 .",
    "\\label{para12}\\end{aligned}\\]]then , the fano factor @xmath107 also follows straightforwardly .    from equations  ( [ current])-([para12 ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that the charge current @xmath108 , the shot noise @xmath109 , and hence the fano factor @xmath43 depend on the excitation rate @xmath110 and the relaxation rate @xmath111 induced by the qpc .",
    "these reveal the impacts of the backaction from the charge detector .",
    "more importantly , because of the nontrivial dependence of both @xmath110 and @xmath112 on the applied voltage across the qpc [ see equations  ( [ backactionrates1 ] ) and  ( [ backactionrates2 ] ) ] , the presence of the charge - detector - induced backaction can be experimentally checked . note that in the case of no backaction , where @xmath78 and @xmath113 in equations  ( [ current ] ) and ( [ shot_noise ] ) are equal to zero , our results reduce to the previous results obtained by other approaches@xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "the temperature is here chosen to be zero because it is extremely low in quantum - transport experiments .",
    "other parameters like the interdot coupling strength @xmath114 and the tunneling rate @xmath115 are taken from the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the charge current obtained from the cumulant @xmath116 of the counting statistics is calculated both _ with _ and _ without _ backaction , and the results are presented in figure  2 .",
    "when the backaction from the charge detector is taken into account , we observe that the current through the dqd is significantly enhanced as shown in figure  2(a ) .",
    "in particular , when @xmath117 , a plateau with a constant current is observed [ see , e.g. , figure  2(b ) ] .",
    "this plateau corresponds to a regime in which qpc - induced excitations is suppressed but there is still a constant relaxation rate contributed by the presence of the qpc , as can be interpreted from equations  ( [ backactionrates1 ] ) and  ( [ backactionrates2 ] ) .",
    "physically , a critical energy @xmath118 exists for the qpc - induced excitation of an electron in the dqd and is hence required to change the current@xcite . beyond the regime of constant current ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath119 , it is clearly shown that in the region shown in figure  2(b ) the current increases with the magnitude of the voltage applied across the qpc in a nearly linear manner .",
    "for the fano factor @xmath107 , our results are given in figure  3 .",
    "as shown in figure  3(a ) , the nature of the shot noise can be changed from _",
    "sub_-poissonian ( @xmath120 ) to _ super_-poissonian ( @xmath121 ) , and vice versa , under the qpc - induced backaction .",
    "without backaction , e.g. , when the qpc is decoupled to the dqd , the fano factor is always smaller than one , i.e. , _",
    "sub_-poissonian , implying the anti - bunching of electrons [ see the dashed line in figure  3(b ) ] .",
    "if qpc - induced backaction is considered but with a condition @xmath122 , we find a plateau similar to that in the current . as mentioned above",
    ", the electron transport in this regime does not involve qpc - induced excitations . outside this plateau ( i.e. @xmath123 )",
    ", the fano factor increases with @xmath124 . for a sufficiently large bias",
    ", we can get @xmath125 [ see figures  3(b ) and the solid curve in figure  3(a ) ] , indicating that the electron transport is uncorrelated in time and is described by _",
    "poissonian _ statistics . beyond this large bias",
    ", we have @xmath126 .",
    "thus , bunching of electrons in the transport through the dqd occurs , resulting in _ super_-poissonian noise .",
    "physically , the effective tunneling rates for two eigenstate channels are obtained as @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( see methods ) . without backaction ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath129 , it follows that @xmath130 under the resonance condition ( i.e. , @xmath131 ) because of @xmath132 .",
    "this corresponds to _ sub_-poissonian noise ( i.e. , @xmath120 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath133 for the dashed line in figure  3(b ) .",
    "when the detector - induced backaction is included , i.e. , @xmath134 , the effective tunneling rates become unequal ( i.e. , @xmath135 ) even if @xmath132 under the resonance condition .",
    "this increases @xmath43 but @xmath43 is still smaller than @xmath136 for small values of @xmath137 .",
    "however , when @xmath137 further increases , it enhances @xmath112 and @xmath110 [ see equations  ( [ backactionrates1 ] ) and  ( [ backactionrates2 ] ) ] , i.e. , the relaxation and the excitation .",
    "this makes the two effective tunneling rates more asymmetric , yielding @xmath121 ( i.e. , _ super_-poissonian noise ) at large values of @xmath137 . therefore , the change of shot noise from being _",
    "sub_-poissonian to _ super_-poissonian is due to the effect of dynamical blocked channels@xcite induced by the qpc backaction .",
    "we also numerically calculate the skewness @xmath138 ( see figure  4 ) . as demonstrated in figure  4(a ) , the skewness can be changed from being positive ( @xmath139 ) to negative ( @xmath140 ) , and vice versa , under the qpc - induced backaction .",
    "here @xmath141 corresponds to a symmetric gaussian distribution of electron tunneling , where the tunneling of the larger number of electrons in a given time duration occurs with the same probability as the tunneling of the smaller number of electrons , with respect to a mean value . for @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) ,",
    "the distribution of electron tunneling becomes asymmetric with the tunneling of the larger number of electrons in a given duration occurring with a higher ( lower ) probability . without backaction ,",
    "the skewness is always positive [ see the dashed line in figure  4(b ) ] .",
    "when qpc - induced backaction is included but with @xmath142 , a plateau similar to that in either current or fano factor appears . in this region ,",
    "qpc - induced excitations are not involved in the electron transport . outside this region (",
    "i.e. , @xmath143 ) , the skewness can be either positive or negative , depending on the values of @xmath144 and @xmath137 [ see figure  4(b ) and the regions surrounded by solid curves in figure  4(a ) ] .",
    "this indicates that the distribution of transported electrons can deviate from the gaussian in an opposite way .",
    "note that the qpc - induced dephasing is not discussed above .",
    "this is because such dephasing with a rate @xmath80 ( @xmath145 ) does not induce any transitions between different states of the dqd .",
    "however , it is known that dephasing produces broadening of the energy levels of the dqd@xcite , and then can affect the current . indeed , in this case , the resonance condition ( i.e. , @xmath102 ) may be violated .",
    "below we numerically study the backaction effect under the off - resonance condition ( i.e. , @xmath146 ) because analytical results can not be derived in this more general case .",
    "to investigate the effect of the energy difference @xmath147 on the detector - induced backaction , we calculate the current , the shot noise , the fano factor , and the skewness using the same parameters as in figures  2(b ) and 3(b ) . in figure  5(a ) , the dotted curve shows the behavior of the current under the resonance condition ( i.e. , @xmath131 ) . when the energy difference @xmath147 increases , the current decreases [ see the dashed and solid curves in figure  5(a ) ] .",
    "moreover , within the region @xmath148 , the current decreases with increasing @xmath137 under the off - resonance condition ( i.e. , @xmath149 ) . outside the region ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath150 , the current varies more nonlinearly with the voltage @xmath151 , as compared with the current under @xmath131 .",
    "physically , the increase of @xmath147 , e.g. , from @xmath131 to @xmath152 mev , makes the electron tunneling between the two dots more off - resonant , so the current through them decreases@xcite .",
    "in addition , the qpc - induced dephasing can yield the broadening of the energy levels at a given nonzero @xmath147 , which can further reduce the current@xcite .",
    "the effect of dephasing is contrary to the effects of excitation and relaxation which increase the current [ see equation  ( [ current ] ) ] . as a result ,",
    "these two opposite effects compete in the electron - tunneling processes at a given nonzero @xmath147 . within the region @xmath148",
    ", the dephasing effect dominates , leading to a decreasing current with the increase of @xmath137 . outside this region ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath153 , both relaxation and excitation processes play an important role , so the current increases with @xmath137 .",
    "the results of the shot noise ( i.e. , @xmath154 ) are shown in figure  5(b ) .",
    "the shot noise decreases with the increase of the energy difference @xmath147 . at a given nonzero @xmath147 ,",
    "the shot noise decreases with increasing @xmath137 within the region @xmath148 . outside this region ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath153 , the shot noise increases with @xmath137 .",
    "these behaviors are similar to those of the current . from both current and shot noise , the fano factor",
    "is straightforwardly obtained , as shown in figure  5(c ) .",
    "when @xmath137 is small , the fano factor increases with the energy difference @xmath147 .",
    "however , for large values of @xmath137 , fano factor is suppressed .",
    "moreover , the fano factor first decreases and then increases with @xmath137 at a given nonzero @xmath147 .",
    "these behaviors can be deduced from the current in figure  5(a ) and the shot noise in figure  5(b ) since @xmath155 .",
    "physically , the off - resonance electron tunneling between two dots is enhanced when increasing @xmath147 .",
    "this off - resonance makes the two eigenstate channels more asymmetric ( i.e. , @xmath156 ) around the region @xmath148 , and then the fano factor increases due to dynamical blockaded channels@xcite . for large values of @xmath137 where backaction becomes strong , the decrease of the fano factor with increasing @xmath147 may be due to the qpc - induced backaction .",
    "the results of the skewness are shown in figure  5(d ) . for small values of @xmath137 ,",
    "the skewness increases with @xmath147 .",
    "however , the skewness is suppressed when @xmath137 becomes large .",
    "also , the skewness first decreases and then increases with @xmath137 at a given nonzero @xmath147 .",
    "these behaviors are similar to those of the fano factor , which also indicate that the off - resonance electron tunneling dominates for small values of @xmath137 and the qpc - induced backaction plays an important role for large values of @xmath137 .",
    "note that in the strong coulomb - blockade regime , we only need to consider the lowest two energy levels of the dqd . in this aspect ,",
    "it is similar to the single two - level dot in ref .",
    ". however , the dqd are different from the single two - level dot in other aspects . for instance , the dqd provides more controllabilities than a single quantum dot .",
    "it can be tuned by not only the two single - dot levels of the dqd but also the interdot tunneling strength via gate voltages . however , in a single quantum dot , only the level spacing can be tuned by the trap potential of the dot .",
    "also , the electron transport through a single quantum dot only involves the tunneling rates @xmath157 and @xmath144 , while the electron transport through the dqd involves the effective tunneling rates of the two eigenstate channels , i.e. , @xmath158 and @xmath159 ( see methods ) , which depend on the energy difference @xmath147 of the two single - dot levels and the tunneling strength @xmath114 between these two levels .",
    "as seen in methods , both @xmath160 and @xmath161 are functions of @xmath147 and @xmath114 . moreover ,",
    "in our considered setup , the qpc can induce excitation and relaxation as well as dephasing on the electron that tunnels through the dqd [ see the interaction hamiltonian in the eigenstate basis , i.e. , equations  ( [ eq : interactionh1 ] ) , ( [ eq : interactionh11 ] ) and ( [ eq : interactionh12 ] ) in methods ] . this is also different from a single quantum dot because the qpc can only induce dephasing on the electron that tunnels through this single dot@xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the unavoidable detector - induced backaction on the counting statistics of a biased dqd .",
    "we find that this backaction has profound effects on the counting statistics , e.g. , changing the shot noise from being sub - poissonian regime to super - poissonian , and changing the skewness from being positive to negative .",
    "we also show that when the energy difference between two single - dot levels of the dqd increases , both fano factor and skewness can be either enhanced or suppressed under the detector - induced backaction .",
    "these backaction effects can be experimentally examined by using the current technologies .",

    "<S> full counting statistics of electron transport is of fundamental importance for a deeper understanding of the underlying physical processes in quantum transport in nanoscale devices . </S>",
    "<S> the backaction effect from a detector on the nanoscale devices is also essential due to its inevitable presence in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate the backaction of a charge detector in the form of a quantum point contact ( qpc ) on the counting statistics of a biased double quantum dot ( dqd ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this inevitable qpc - induced backaction can have profound effects on the counting statistics under certain conditions , e.g. , changing the shot noise from being sub - poissonian to super - poissonian , and changing the skewness from being positive to negative . also , we show that both fano factor and skewness can be either enhanced or suppressed by increasing the energy difference between two single - dot levels of the dqd under the detector - induced backaction .    </S>",
    "<S> current fluctuations in nanoscale systems provide key insights into the nature of charge transfer beyond what is obtainable from a conductance measurement alone ( see , e.g. , refs .  1 and  2 for recent reviews ) . </S>",
    "<S> an in - depth understanding , however , may require us to go beyond the first - order and even the second - order current correlation functions ( corresponding to the average current and the shot noise respectively ) to study the full counting statistics@xcite which yields all zero - frequency correlation functions at once . </S>",
    "<S> real - time detection of the tunneling of individual electrons , an important step towards experimental measurement of the full counting statistics , has recently been achieved in various qd systemsrimberg2003nature , fujisawa2004apl , bylanderdelsing2005nature . in particular , since its measurement in a single qd for the first timegustavsson2006prl , counting statistics has become an important experimental tool to examine interaction and coherence effects in nanoscale systems under out - of - equilibrium conditionsflindt2009pnas , gabelli2009prb , fricke2010apl , choi2012apl , ubbelohde2012 . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , counting statistics was applied to characterize correlations in both classical and quantum systemsivanov2012arxiv .    </S>",
    "<S> however , a pronounced effect known as backaction on the counting statistics of electron transport@xcite is inevitably introduced during measurements made by even most noninvasive detectors such as a quantum point contact ( qpc)@xcite . very recently , such backaction has been investigated experimentally in a single qdsukhorukov2007nphys , li - guopingguo2012apl . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to a single qd , a double quantum dot ( dqd)@xcite involves coherent coupling between two different dots , and therefore can be used to demonstrate prominent coherent effects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the counting statistics for dqds has been studied theoretically@xcite and experimentally only for noise properties@xcite . in a dqd measured by a qpc , both the current and the shot noise of the qpc have been previously investigatedgurvitz1997prb , korotkov2001prb , ruskovkorotkov2003prb , youngclerk2010prl . in addition , for a zero - bias dqd </S>",
    "<S> , the effect of charge - detector - induced backaction was studied theoretically@xcite to explain experimental observations of inelastic electron tunnelinggustavsson2007prl . </S>",
    "<S> however , to the best of our knowledge , the impacts of charge - detector - induced backaction on the full counting statistics in these qd systems have not yet been studied .    here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the counting statistics of electron transport through a biased dqd under measurement by a charge detector . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this inevitable backaction can indeed have profound effects on the counting statistics under certain conditions for the dqd . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it can change the nature of the shot noise from being sub - poissonian to super - poissonian and also change the skewness from being positive to negative . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that when the energy difference between two single - dot levels of the dqd increases , both fano factor and skewness can be either enhanced or suppressed under the detector - induced backaction . </S>",
    "<S> these qpc - backaction - induced effects are expected to be experimentally observable with currently existing technologies . </S>",
    "<S> apart from a deeper understanding of experimental observations , this study may also shed light on how to control these qd systems using the backaction of a charge detector . </S>"
