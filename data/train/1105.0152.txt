    "the purpose of this paper is to show some of the uses and definitions for making quantum information versions of combinatorial and topological structures .",
    "we begin in section 2 by reviewing our previous work on quantum knots where we model the topological information in a knot by a state vector in a hilbert space that is directly constructed from mosaic diagrams for the knots . in section 3",
    "we discuss some issues for these models relating topological and quantum entanglement . in section 4",
    "we give a general definition of quantization of mathematical structures and apply it to the quantization of the set of classical knots ( embeddings of a circle into three dimensional space ) and the group of homeomorphisms of three dimensional space that acts on this set of embeddings .",
    "the hilbert space that results from this set of embeddings is very large , but descriptive of the sort of knotting phenomena that may occur in nature such as knotted vortices in super - cooled helium or knotted gluon fields . in section 5",
    "we define quantum gauss codes and show how to formulate quantum knot theory in the context of these codes . in section 6 we define a quantum version of directed graphs ( see also @xcite ) and in section 7 we define a quantization of the words in a group presentation . in the remaining sections of the paper we outline previous work @xcite defining hilbert spaces that correspond to enhanced states of the bracket state sum for the jones polynomial .",
    "these constructions lead to quantum algorithms for the jones polynomial that are of conceptual interest because of their relationship with khovanov homology . in this last part of the paper we are quantizing an unusual combinatorial structure - the set of enhanced states of the bracket polynomial . by making this set of states into a hilbert space ,",
    "we combine our notions of quantization with khovanov s construction that associates a chain complex to a knot diagram .",
    "this paper contains a wide range of constructions and it is intended to provide a springboard for discussion of the use of such quantization in quantum information theory .",
    "for an in depth view of basic aspects of our quantization procedures the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the present paper is an expanded version of a paper @xcite presented at the spie conference in orlando , florida in april 2011 .",
    "we begin by explaining the basic idea of mosaic quantum knots as it appears in our papers @xcite .",
    "a recent application of quantum knots can be found @xcite in a recent paper by farhi , gosset , hassidim , lutominski and shor . there",
    "the reader will find proof that quantum knots is a money - making idea .",
    "view figures 1 , and 2 . in the left - most part of figure 1",
    "we illustrate a mosaic version of a trefoil knot using a @xmath0 space of tiles . in figure 2",
    "we show the eleven basic tiles that can be repeated used in @xmath1 tile spaces to make diagrams for any classical knot or link .",
    "so far this is a method for depicting knots and links and has no quantum interpretation .",
    "however , as in our previous papers , we use the philosophy that given a well - defined discrete set of objects , one can define a vector space with an orhonormal basis that is in one - to - one correspondence with these objects . here",
    "we let @xmath2 be the complex vector space with basis in one - to - one correspondence with the set of eleven basic tiles shown in figure 2 .",
    "an @xmath1 mosaic as shown in figure 1 is then regarded as an element in the tensor product of @xmath3 copies of @xmath2 .",
    "we order the tensor product by consectively going through the rows of the mosaice from left to right and from top to bottom . in this way",
    ", knot diagrams represented by @xmath1 mosaics are realized as vectors in @xmath4 where there are @xmath3 factors in this tensor product .",
    "isotopy moves on the mosaic diagrams are encoded by tile replacements that induce unitary transformations on the hilbert space .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the details .",
    "the upshot of this fomulation of isotopies of the knots is that the diagrammatic isotopies correspond to unitary transformations of the hilbert space @xmath5 when the isotopies are restricted to the @xmath1 lattice . in this way we obtain for each @xmath6 a group of isotopies",
    "@xmath7 that we call the _ ambient group_. this has the advantage that it turns a version of the reidemeister moves on knot and link diagrams into a group and it provides for a quantum formulation not just for the knot and link diagrams , but also for their isotopies . knots and links",
    "are usually regarded as entities of a classical nature . by making them into quantum information ,",
    "we have created a domain of quantum knots and links .",
    "there are many problems and many avenues available for the exploration of quantum knots and links .",
    "it is not the purpose of this paper to specialize in this topic .",
    "we show them in order to emphasize the idea that one can quantize combinatorial categories by formulating appropriate hilbert spaces for their objects and morphisms . however , it is worth mentioning that other diagrammatic categories for knots and links can be easily accomodated in the mosaic link framework .",
    "view figure 1 again and examine the middle and right diagrams in the figure . here",
    "we show diagrams containing white and black graphical nodes .",
    "these can be interpreted for extensions of knot theory to virtual knots or knotted graph embeddings .",
    "one extends the vector space for the basic tiles and then also adds moves that are appropriate for the theory in question . in the case of virtual knot theory and the theory of knotted graphs ,",
    "there is no problem in making these extensions",
    ". we will carry them out in a separate paper .",
    "the point of this section has been to remind the reader of our previous work , and to point to these avenues along which it can be extended .",
    "the reader will find an in depth treatment of many aspects of these quantization procedures in @xcite .",
    "after a a discussion of ideas and examples , the present paper concentrates on a quantization related to khovanov homology in sections 7 , 8 and 9 .    lets go back to classical knot theory in mosaic form .",
    "one of the problems in studying this theory is the matter of articulating invariants of knots so that they are quantum observables for the theory .",
    "many invariants such as the jones polynomial and even the bracket model for the jones polynomial ( which we will discuss later in this paper ) seem to be resistant to formulation as quantum observables .",
    "however , there is a very general result for mosaic quantum knots that is intellectually satisfying that we have proved in our earlier work @xcite",
    ".    * theorem 1 .",
    "* let @xmath8 be a mosaic knot diagram in an @xmath1 lattice .",
    "then there is a quantum observable @xmath9 such that @xmath10 if and only if @xmath11 is in the orbit of @xmath12 under the action of the ambient group @xmath13 when @xmath14 is not in the orbit , then @xmath15 in other words @xmath9 is a characteristic function for the knot - type of @xmath16 in the @xmath1 mosaic lattice .",
    "* proof . * define @xmath9 by the formula @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the orbit of @xmath8 under the action of the ambient group @xmath13 note that @xmath18 is a finite set .",
    "the theorem follows directly from this definition . //",
    "this theorem does not make invariants of knots that are efficient to calculate , but it is intellectually satisfying to know that , in principle , in the @xmath1 lattice , we can distinguish two diagrams that are inequivalent by the reidemeister moves for that lattice size .",
    "furthermore , we can use the characteristic observables @xmath19 to make observables for any real valued classical knot invariant . by a classical knot invariant ,",
    "we mean a function on standard knot diagrams that is invariant under the usual graphical reidemeister moves .",
    "such a function is also tautologically defined on mosaic diagrams and is invariant under the mosaic moves for any @xmath1 mosaic lattice .",
    "for example , the jones polynomial @xcite @xmath20 is a laurent polynomial valued invariant . by taking the variable @xmath21 in the jones polynomial to be a specific real number , we obtain from the jones polynomial , a real - valued classical knot invariant",
    ".    * theorem 2 .",
    "* let @xmath22 denote a real - valued classical invariant of knots and links .",
    "then there is an observable @xmath23 on the hilbert space for any @xmath1 mosaic lattice such that @xmath24 for any knot vector @xmath8 in the lattice . in this sense",
    ", any real - valued classical knot invariant corresponds to a quantum observable whose eigenvalues are the values of this invariant .",
    "* define the observable @xmath23 by the formula @xmath25 where @xmath16 runs over one representative for each ambient group orbit in the @xmath1 mosaic lattice . here",
    "@xmath9 is the observable defined in theorem 1 .",
    "the theorem then follows directly from this definition . //    in this sense ,",
    "the quantum observables for mosaic quantum knots are universal with respect to real - valued classical knot invariants .",
    "it remains to be seen if there are such observables that have a better than classical efficiency of calculation .",
    "other issues for quantum knots involve considering superpositions of them and properties of these superpositions .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for examples along these lines .",

    "* some caveats are important in using these moves .",

    "this means that there is a limitation to the performance of this type of move if we take @xmath31 to be finite .",
    "if we wish to use infinite dimensional spaces , then there is no limitation . in the case of infinite dimensional spaces for the indices",
    "the basic space will be denoted by @xmath32.$ ] since in doing a move in a direction such as @xmath30 one needs the existence of appropriate blanks in the tensor product , some moves that a classical knot theorist might want are not neccesarily available .",
    "this is the limitation of the number of the @xmath33 tensor factors in the hilbert space @xmath28.$ ] again , we can eliminate this restriction by letting @xmath33 be infinite .",
    "the individual vectors will then be of the form @xmath34 where all factors are blank beyond some finite but unlimited number of factors .",
    "in this case one can apply the cyclic permutation to the first @xmath35 ( as above ) factors .    with these remarks ,",
    "the space of quantum gauss codes has a an ambient group of generalized reidemeister moves acting unitarily upon it and we can do quantum knot theory in this category .",
    "the theorems we have proved in the previous section on observables and invariants of mosaic quantum knots apply mutatis mutandis to the quantum gauss codes .",
    "the codes provide a combinatorial way to handle problems in knot theory and they are very close to both computational aspects and to the theory of invariants .",
    "one advantage in using the gauss code formalism for quantum knots is that one can depict them with the usual knot diagrams , however the extra appearance of blanks in the quantum codes must be made to correspond to flattened crossings in the diagrams as is illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "much more remains to be done in this domain .",
    "in @xcite , in section 28 , we consider the concept of a quantum graph where the graph is a lattice graph in either a planar lattice ( the context for mosaic quantum knots ) or a three dimensional lattice ( the context for quantum knots in a three dimensional form ) . in this section",
    "we point out a generalization that is implicit in our original definition , allowing a quantization of arbitrary abstract graphs .",
    "let @xmath36 be a finite simple directed graph in the sense of graph theory .",
    "this means that @xmath36 consists in a finite set of _ nodes ( vertices ) _ , denoted by @xmath37 and a finite set of _ edges _ denoted by @xmath38 such that every edge is associated with two distinct nodes of @xmath36 in the form of an orderer pair @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are distinct elements of the set of vertices @xmath42 we will denote an edge by its corresponding ordered pair .",
    "note that given two distinct nodes @xmath40 and @xmath41 there are up to two edges associated with them : @xmath39 and @xmath43 a graph is completely specified by giving the vertex set @xmath37 and a set of ordered pairs of distinct nodes , specifying @xmath44 two graphs are _ isomorphic _ if there is a @xmath45 correspondence between their sets of nodes that induces a @xmath45 correspondence between their sets of edges .",

    "graph isomorphisms are induced by appropriate permutations of the set @xmath57 and induce unitary transformations on the space @xmath58 we will stop here at this point of definition , and continue the analysis of quantum graphs in a separate paper .",
    "in this section the letter @xmath36 will stand for a finitely presented and finitely related group .",
    "if @xmath36 has generators @xmath59 then we can consider words in the group @xmath36 as products of these generators including an identity symbol @xmath60 then we can represent a word in the group by a corresponding tensor product of kets .",
    "for example @xmath61 will correspond to the ket @xmath62 in this way , words in the group presentation correspond to elements of a complex tensor product of a space spanned by the kets @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 the same considerations that we have made in the previous constructions allow us to define unitary transformations corresponding to applications of the group laws and the relations in the group .",
    "finite dimensional tensor products hold only words up to a given length , but we can also work with the full set of words in the group by using infinite tensor products of the base space .",
    "note that essentially the same construction can be applied to any algebraic system with a single ( semi ) binary operation .",
    "this includes the possibility of quantizing sequences of composable morphisms in an arbitrary category .",
    "note also that in making a construction of this kind , we actually quantize all the words in the group.such quantizations have at the present time little to do with the subject of so - called quantum groups . in the case of the artin braid group",

    "we have the formula as a sum over enhanced states @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the number of @xmath68-type smoothings in @xmath106 and @xmath107 , with @xmath108 the number of loops labeled @xmath96 minus the number of loops labeled @xmath97 in the enhanced state @xmath109    one advantage of the expression of the bracket polynomial via enhanced states is that it is now a sum of monomials .",
    "we shall make use of this property throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "we now use the enhanced state summation for the bracket polynomial with variable @xmath95 to give a quantum formulation of the state sum .",
    "let @xmath95 be on the unit circle in the complex plane .",

    "one can hardly avoid using @xmath113 for homology .",
    "with @xmath95 on the unit circle , we define a unitary transformation @xmath114 by the formula @xmath115 for each enhanced state @xmath109 here @xmath105 and @xmath116 are as defined in the previous section of this paper .",

    "this is a direct way to give a physical interpretation of the bracket state sum and the jones polynomial .",
    "just how this process can be implemented physically depends upon the interpretation of the hilbert space @xmath121 it is common practice in theorizing about quantum computing and quantum information to define a hilbert space in terms of some mathematically convenient basis ( such as the enhanced states of the knot or link diagram @xmath16 ) and leave open the possibility of a realization of the space and the quantum evolution operators that have been defined upon it . in principle",
    "any finite dimensional unitary operator can be realized by some physical system . in practice , this is the problem of constructing quantum computers and quantum information devices .",
    "it is not so easy to construct what can be done in principle , and the quantum states that are produced may be all too short - lived to produce reliable computation .",
    "nevertheless , one has the freedom to create spaces and operators on the mathematical level and to conceptualize these in a quantum mechanical framework .",

    ", @xmath152 is a subcomplex of @xmath110 with the boundary operator @xmath153 consequently , we can speak of the homology @xmath154 note that the dimension of @xmath155 is equal to the number of enhanced states @xmath156 with @xmath140 and @xmath157 consequently , we have @xmath158 @xmath159 here we use the definition of the _ euler characteristic of a chain complex _ @xmath160 and the fact that the euler characteristic of the complex is equal to the euler characteristic of its homology . the quantum amplitude associated with the operator @xmath132 is given in terms of the euler characteristics of the khovanov homology of the link",
    "@xmath74 @xmath161    our reformulation of the bracket polynomial in terms of the unitary operator @xmath132 leads to a new viewpoint on the khovanov homology as a representation space for the action of @xmath162 the bracket polynomial is then a quantum amplitude that expresses the euler characteristics of the homology associated with this action . the decomposition of the chain complex into the parts @xmath163 corresponds to the eigenspace decomposition of the operator @xmath162 the reader will note that in this case the operator @xmath132 is already diagonal in the basis of enhanced states for the chain complex @xmath121 we regard this reformulation as a guide to further questions about the relationship of the khovanov homology with quantum information associated with the link @xmath74    the internal combinatorial structure of the set of enhanced states for the bracket summation leads to the khovanov homology theory , whose graded euler characteristic yields the bracket state sum .",
    "thus we have a quantum statistical interpretation of the euler characteristics of the khovanov homology theory , and a conceptual puzzle about the nature of this relationship with the hilbert space of that quantum theory .",
    "it is that relationship that is the subject of this paper .",
    "the unusual point about the hilbert space is that each of its basis elements has a specific combinatorial structure that is related to the topology of the knot @xmath74 thus this hilbert space is , from the point of view of its basis elements , a form of  taking apart \" of the topological structure of the knot that we are interested in studying .",
    "* homological structure of the unitary transformation .",
    "* we now prove a general result about the structure of a chain complex that is also a finite dimensional hilbert space .",

    "let @xmath168 be a unitary operator that satisfies the equation @xmath169 we do not assume a second grading @xmath149 as occurs in the khovanov homology .",
    "however , since @xmath132 is unitary , it follows that there is a basis for @xmath164 in which @xmath132 is diagonal .",
    "let @xmath170 denote this basis .",
    "let @xmath171 denote the eigenvalue of @xmath132 corresponding to @xmath172 so that @xmath173 let @xmath174 be the matrix element for @xmath135 so that @xmath175 where @xmath176 runs over a set of basis elements so that @xmath177        in this way we see that eigenvalues will propagate forward from @xmath184 with alternating signs according to the appearance of successive basis elements in the boundary formulas for the chain complex .",
    "various states of affairs are possible in general , with new eigenvaluues starting at some @xmath185 for @xmath186 the simplest state of affairs would be if all the possible eigenvalues ( up to multiplication by @xmath97 ) for @xmath132 occurred in @xmath184 so that @xmath187 where @xmath188 runs over all the distinct eigenvalues of @xmath132 restricted to @xmath189 and @xmath190 is spanned by all @xmath156 in @xmath184 with @xmath191 let us take the further assumption that for each @xmath188 as above , the subcomplexes @xmath192 have @xmath193 as their direct sum . with this assumption about the chain complex ,",
    "define @xmath194 as before , with @xmath139 running over the whole basis for @xmath195 then it follows just as in the beginning of this section that @xmath196 here @xmath197 denotes the euler characteristic of the homology .",
    "the point is , that this formula for @xmath198 takes exactly the form we had for the special case of khovanov homology ( with eigenvalues @xmath199 ) , but here the formula occurs just in terms of the eigenspace decomposition of the unitary transformation @xmath132 in relation to the chain complex .",
    "clearly there is more work to be done here and we will return to it in a subsequent paper .",
    "* remark on the density matrix . * given the state @xmath200 we can define the _ density matrix _ @xmath201 with this definition it is immediate that @xmath202 where @xmath203 denotes the trace of a matrix @xmath204 thus we can restate the form of our result about euler characteristics as @xmath205 in searching for an interpretation of the khovanov complex in this quantum context it is useful to use this reformulation . for the bracket we have @xmath206",
    "the hilbert space for expressing the bracket polynomial as a quantum statistical amplitude is quite naturally the chain complex for khovanov homology with complex coefficients , and the unitary transformation that is the structure of the bracket polynomial acts on the homology of this chain complex .",

    "we would like to exploit this direct relationship between the quantum model and the khovanov homology to obtain deeper information about the relationship of topology and quantum information theory , and we would like to use this relationship to probe the properties of these topological invariants .",
