    "in recent years the study of potential theory for ` laplacians ' associated with classical orthogonal expansions attracted considerable attention .",
    "the model case of the riesz potentials @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the euclidean laplacian in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is related to continuous expansions with respect to the system @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath1 boundedness of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , is characterized by the celebrated hardy - littlewood - sobolev theorem .    in @xcite bongioanni and torrea",
    "investigated potential operators related to the harmonic oscillator @xmath9 , which plays the role of a laplacian in the context of multi - dimensional hermite function expansions .",
    "some complementary comments on that research are contained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) .",
    "more recently , in @xcite it was shown that the @xmath1 bounds obtained in @xcite for the potential operator @xmath10 are in fact sharp in the sense of admissible @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this was achieved as a consequence of qualitatively sharp estimates for the integral kernel of @xmath13 established also in @xcite . a thorough study of potential operators associated with classical one - dimensional jacobi and fourier - bessel expansions has just been furnished by nowak and roncal @xcite .",
    "the corresponding analysis is based on sharp estimates of the potential kernels proved in that work .",
    "potential operators related to multi - dimensional laguerre operators in @xmath14 , and to the dunkl harmonic oscillator in @xmath4 with the underlying reflection group isomorphic to @xmath15 , were investigated by the authors in @xcite . recall that the latter ` laplacian ' is a differential - difference operator , and its eigenfunctions express via certain laguerre functions . hence the associated expansions are sometimes referred to as dunkl - laguerre expansions .",
    "the aim of @xcite was to prove @xmath1 bounds for the considered potential operators for a possibly wide range of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "another objective was to obtain in a similar spirit two - weight @xmath1 bounds , with power weights involved .",
    "all these results in @xcite were derived as indirect and somewhat tricky consequences of analogous theory for @xmath16 , and under the restriction @xmath17 on the multi - parameter of type .",
    "the present paper is motivated by the natural question to what extent the results of @xcite are optimal in the sense of admissible @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "further motivation comes from a related problem , but certainly of independent interest , of describing the behavior of the relevant potential kernels via pointwise estimates .",
    "finally , yet another motivation follows from a desire to get rid of the above mentioned restriction on @xmath18 .",
    "all these inspirations found a positive outcome .",
    "for technical reasons , we consider only @xmath19 and thus work in dimension one , otherwise the analysis we present would become much more sophisticated .",
    "then we investigate the settings from @xcite , that is , according to the terminology used in @xcite , the situations of laguerre function expansions of convolution and hermite types , and dunkl - laguerre expansions ( see section [ sec : prel ] for the definitions ) , with no artificial restrictions on @xmath18 imposed .",
    "we prove qualitatively sharp estimates for the relevant potential kernels ( theorems [ thm : conv_ker ] and [ thm : d_ker ] ) .",
    "then we characterize those @xmath20 , for which the potential operators are @xmath1 bounded ( theorems [ thm : lplqlag ] , [ thm : lag_h ] and [ thm : lag_d ] ) . in particular , it follows that the unweighted @xmath1 bounds from @xcite are in fact sharp , at least in the one - dimensional case .",
    "it is remarkable that our present results enable further research which is no doubt of interest , but beyond the scope of this work .",
    "let us mention here the following issues :    * characterization of weak type and restricted weak type inequalities for the potential operators ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.7 , 2.8 ) ) , * characterization of two - weight @xmath1 inequalities for the potential operators , with power weights involved ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 1.2 , 2.5 , 3.3 , 4.2 , 6.2 ) ; note that it is known that at least some of these results are not optimal ) , * development of analogous theory for other variants of fractional integrals in the laguerre and dunkl - laguerre settings , or more generally , for laplace - stieltjes type multipliers ( see the comments closing ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) and ( * ? ? ? * section 3 ) ) .",
    "finally , we remark that although the present framework is one - dimensional , it has , at least in the setting of laguerre expansions of convolution type , a multi - dimensional background .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath21 , @xmath22 , then the context of laguerre function expansions of convolution type is related to a ` radial ' analysis in @xmath23 equipped with twisted convolution , see @xcite for details . continuing this line of thought , we note that the system of laguerre functions of hermite type also has a multi - dimensional connection , since it consists of eigenfunctions of the hankel transform .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : prel ] we briefly introduce the settings to be investigated and state the main results ( theorems [ thm : conv_ker]-[thm : d_ker ] and theorem [ thm : lag_d ] ) .",
    "the corresponding proofs are contained in the two succeeding sections . in section [",
    "sec : pot ] we show qualitatively sharp estimates for the relevant potential kernels .",
    "section [ sec : lplq ] is devoted to characterizing @xmath1 boundedness of the laguerre and dunkl - laguerre potential operators .    throughout the paper",
    "we use a standard notation , which is consistent with that used in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we write @xmath24 to indicate that @xmath25 with a positive constant @xmath26 independent of significant quantities .",
    "we shall write @xmath27 when simultaneously @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath30 means that there exist positive constants @xmath31 , independent of significant quantities , such that @xmath32 in a number of places we will use natural and self - explanatory generalizations of the `` @xmath33 '' relation , for instance , in connection with certain integrals involving exponential factors . in such cases",
    "the exact meaning will be clear from the context . by convention , `` @xmath33 ''",
    "is understood as `` @xmath34 '' whenever no exponential factors are involved .",
    "we treat positive kernels and integrals as expressions valued in the extended half - line @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "similar remark concerns expressions occurring in various estimates , with the natural limiting interpretations like , for instance , @xmath36 when @xmath37 .",
    "we will consider two interrelated settings corresponding to one - dimensional laguerre function expansions of convolution type and of hermite type . also , we will study the one - dimensional context of dunkl - laguerre expansions associated with the dunkl harmonic oscillator and the underlying group of reflections isomorphic to @xmath38 .",
    "the latter situation may be regarded as an extension of that of laguerre function expansions of convolution type , see section [ ssec : dunkl ] below .",
    "all the three frameworks in question have deep roots in the existing literature .",

    "considering @xmath609 , we recall that it is the dual of @xmath591 and use the already proved results for @xmath610 .",
    "this gives the desired @xmath1 boundedness , except for the case @xmath611 which we now treat separately . by and",
    "theorem [ thm : conv_ker ] ( ii ) , @xmath612 integrating in @xmath96 and changing the order of integration produces @xmath613 since the function @xmath614 belongs to @xmath596 , the conclusion follows by hlder s inequality .",
    "let us first introduce some extra notation .",
    "for a function @xmath615 on @xmath128 , define @xmath616 and @xmath617 as functions on @xmath84 given by @xmath618 , @xmath619 . in a similar way ,",
    "let @xmath620 and @xmath621 be the kernels on @xmath622 determined by @xmath623 , @xmath624 .",
    "denote the corresponding integral operators related to the measure space @xmath625 by @xmath626 , respectively .      in view of ,",
    "the kernels @xmath630 are controlled by @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath631 satisfy the positive mapping properties from theorem [ thm : lplqlag ] .",
    "therefore , for the asserted @xmath11 and @xmath12 we can write @xmath632    to show the necessity part , we observe that by the kernel @xmath633 is comparable to @xmath60 .",
    "thus the range of admissible @xmath11 and @xmath12 from theorem [ thm : lplqlag ] is optimal also for @xmath634 .",
    "now , to finish the proof it suffices to notice that if @xmath635 is @xmath1 bounded , then so is @xmath636 . indeed , take a function @xmath615 on @xmath84 and extend it to @xmath637 on @xmath128 by setting @xmath638 for @xmath639",
