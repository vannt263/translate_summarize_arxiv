    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]      abundance ratios for a few elements other than iron were computed for each spectrum , providing uncertainties and final star weighted averages in the same way used for iron ( see table  [ tab : ratios ] ) .",
    "the behaviour of abundance ratios with phase is illustrated in figure  [ fig : abophase ] .",
    "the resulting abundance ratios are also plotted in figure  [ fig : ratios ] versus [ fe / h ] .    in summary , in spite of the obvious difficulties of obtaining parameters and abundance ratios on variable stars",
    "spectra , especially when one observes with long exposure times or outside the optimal phases , the results are stable and broadly comparable to those obtained for non - variable stars _ even rather close to the shock phases _ , if some extra effort is put into a careful selection of spectral lines ( we used an outlier rejection ) and if one accepts the inevitably higher errors and scatter ( of the order of 0.10.15  dex , roughly speaking ) compared to non - variable stars . in other words , the classical ew method based on static atmosphere models still works over most of the pulsation cycle , including the early and main shock regions .",
    "however , immediately after the main shock phase , we note a dangerous zone lying roughly within @xmath10 , depending on the species ( see figure  [ fig : abophase ] ) , which appears indeed to be the region where the maximum disturbance on abundance determinations is reached .",
    "our work fully supports the findings by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , and adds more insight into the main shock phase , where indeed some neutral lines start disappearing @xcite , but other lines appear to remain reliable .",
    "the iron - peak elements abundances of chromium and nickel ( table  [ tab : ratios ] ) , are based on approximately 5 - 15 well - behaved lines for each element ( see also table  [ tab : ew ] for a list of surviving lines ) , depending on the spectrum .",
    "the scatter seems to increase for a few spectra immediately after the main shock phase , and there are a few outliers , but when all measurements for a star are combined through a weighted average , the resulting abundance ratios are rather compatible with solar values , within the highly varying uncertainties ( figure  [ fig : ratios ] ) : the weighted averages are @xmath6[ni / fe]@xmath7=0.08@xmath80.18  dex and @xmath6[cr / fe]@xmath7=0.01@xmath80.11  dex was obtained as the weighted average of [ cr  i / fe ] and [ cr  ii / fe ] . ] .",
    "unlike @xcite , we do not find a large discrepancy between cr  i and cr  ii : @xmath11[cr / fe]@xmath7=0.11@xmath80.11  dex , but we observe that the difference increases after the main shock phase ( figure  [ fig : abophase ] ) and around and after the early shock phase , and that it goes in the same sense as theirs ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the two most metal - poor stars , x  ari and uz  cvn , display rather large errorbars  owing most certainly to the paucity of lines  but , for example , their enhanced nickel abundance is in line with what found by @xcite for field stars .",
    "we also provide abundance ratios for mg  i , ca  i , si  i , ti  i , and ti  ii ( table  [ tab : ratios ] ) , based on approximately 3 , 30 , 10 , 10 , and 20 lines , respectively ( see table  [ tab : ew ] ) . unlike the two iron - peak elements studied above , calcium and magnesium do not seem to display any increase in the scatter after the main shock , although there is a hint of a decrease in their abundance before the shock ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "silicon , which was extensively discussed by @xcite , appears indeed extremely sensitive to the phase , with a larger spread at all phases and very roughly following the t@xmath2 trend .",
    "it was previously reported in the literature @xcite , that silicon lines have largely different nlte effects and that bluer lines should have larger effects in general with respect to redder lines .",
    "our selection of lines ( reported in table  [ tab : ew ] ) , is based on the ew measurement quality and on statistical rejections within the gala routines , thus displaying a rough average effect , with a large spread .",
    "apart from a few outliers , titanium behaves similarly to magnesium and calcium ; we can also observe a constant offset between ti  i and ti  ii , of 0.18@xmath80.10  dex , with ti  i higher than ti  ii . as discussed extensively by @xcite and @xcite , who found a very similar result , the offset is likely caused by uncertainities in the log@xmath12 values of ti  i lines , but lacking a clearer explanation , we chose to obtain [ ti / fe ] as a weighted average of [ ti  i / fe ] and [ ti  ii / fe ] , as done for cr .     of all surviving lines divided by the square root of the number of lines . ]",
    "once the weighted averages of @xmath5-element ratios were computed for each star , we observed that the results were broadly compatible with the typical halo @xmath5-enhancement ( figure  [ fig : ratios ] ) , except for silicon  as said above  with no significant trends with [ fe / h ] .",
    "we obtained : @xmath6[mg / fe]@xmath7=+0.43@xmath80.12  dex , @xmath6[ca / fe]@xmath7=+0.27@xmath80.10  dex , @xmath6[si / fe]@xmath7=+0.73@xmath80.30  dex , and @xmath6[ti / fe]@xmath7=+0.26@xmath80.23  dex .",
    "the average @xmath5-enhancement is @xmath6[@xmath5/fe]@xmath7=+0.31@xmath80.19  dex when excluding silicon ( when including it , both the enhancement and the error are higher by 0.1  dex ) .",
    "five of our program stars were analyzed in the past with high - resolution spectroscopy : tu  uma , vx  her , x  ari , tw  cap , and uy  eri .",
    "tu  uma was observed at phase 0.77 by @xcite and at phase 0.09 by @xcite .",
    "their adopted t@xmath2 are fully consistent with the shaded area in figure  [ fig : teff ] , covered by the @xcite analysis , and thus with our adopted value ; their gravities are generally higher , more consistent with the baade - wesselink results ( see section  [ sec : grav ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; their v@xmath4 are well above 3  km / s , i.e. , 23.5  km / s higher than our value , as expected because of the ew fitting method adopted here ( section  [ sec : micro ] ) .",
    "however , their resulting [ fe / h ] abundances of 1.05  dex @xcite and 1.55  dex @xcite nicely bracket our value of 1.31  dex , and our determination is compatible with both values , considering their quoted errorbars of 0.1  dex @xcite and 0.14  dex @xcite .",
    "errors , plotted versus [ fe / h ] ( see text for details ) .",
    "the field stars abundance ratios measured by @xcite are reported as magenta dots in all panels . ]",
    "vx  her was observed by @xcite at five phases in the range 0.540.69 .",
    "their t@xmath2 value of 5950@xmath8115  k is included in the shaded area in figure  [ fig : teff ] , and is thus compatible with our adopted value ; their log@xmath3 is 2.6  dex , again in line with the baade - wesselink determinations ; their v@xmath4 is 4.5  km / s , thus higher than our determination , as expected .",
    "their resulting [ fe / h]=1.58",
    "dex is very close to the one derived here of 1.56  dex .    the comparison with literature data for x  ari is not straightforward .",
    "we found three different high - resolution studies : @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "they obtained [ fe / h ] of 2.47 , 2.47 , and 2.61  dex , respectively , which are 0.3 - 0.4  dex lower than our determination .",
    "these determinations are only marginally incompatible with the one presented here , given our large combined uncertainty of 0.24  dex , that is mostly due to our large uncertianties in the atmospheric parameters . as a test , we ran again our abundance computations using fixed parameters , more in line with the ones adopted in those studies , i.e. , t@xmath2=6300  k , log@xmath3=2.5  dex and v@xmath4=4.5  km / s : we obtained a much lower [ fe / h]=2.71  dex , but at the expense of the ionization and excitation equilibria , and of the flatness of the [ fe / h ] vs. ew trend vs. excitation potential relation , a slope of -0.16  dex / m   for the [ fe / h ] vs. ew relation , and a difference of 0.18  dex between fe  i and fe  ii . with our parameters",
    "we obtain instead a slope of 0.0063  dex / ev for the [ fe / h ] vs. excitation potential relation , a slope of -0.44  dex / m   for the [ fe / h ] vs. ew relation , and a difference of 0.11  dex between fe  i and fe  ii . ] .",
    "we thus concluded that our spectrum of x  ari does not allow for such low metallicities and we proceeded to look for additional literature determinations .",
    "we found : [ fe / h]=2.01  dex with the @xmath13s method @xcite ; and [ fe / h]=1.97  dex from the baade - wesselink method @xcite .",
    "these add to the [ fe / h]=2.08  dex by @xcite , although @xcite reports 2.43  dex .",
    "our result of 2.19  dex therefore appears to lie in between two groups of discrepant literature values , and we would weaken the internal consistency of our analysis if we adopted significantly different atmospheric parameters .",
    "tw  cap , one of our three population ii cepheids , was studied by @xcite .",
    "they do not report the phase of their observations , but they rejected all spectra showing asymmetric line profiles , thus we can assume that their spectra were far from the shock phases .",
    "their parameters were obtained with a method similar to ours , but they differ from our analysis , being : t@xmath2=5250  k , i.e. , significantly lower than the typical estimates in this paper and in @xcite ; log@xmath3=0.5  dex likewise among the lowest estimates we encountered in the literature ; v@xmath4=3.1  km / s , roughly compatible with the @xcite typical values , but higher than our typical estimates , and lower than the typical v@xmath4 values in older abundance analysis papers quoted so far .",
    "finally , they obtain [ fe / h]=1.8  dex , which is formally consistent with our estimate .",
    "uy  eri is another of our population ii cepheids , also studied by @xcite with high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "they obtain : t@xmath2=6000  k , which is substantially lower than our estimate ; log@xmath3=1.5  dex , roughly compatible with our estimate , v@xmath4=2.9  km / s , higher than our estimate . in this case , their final [ fe / h]=1.84  dex does not agree with our derived 1.43@xmath80.20  dex .",
    "we thus tried employing the parameters adopted by @xcite , even if we do not know at which pulsation phase they were evaluated , and examined the impact on our abundance analysis . as expected , the constancy of [ fe / h ] versus excitation potential , ew , and wavelength were totally disrupted , together with the ionization balance between fe  i and fe  ii , thus proving that our data can not support parameters much different than the ones adopted here .",
    "however , the resulting [ fe / h ] went substantially down , below 2  dex , showing that the different choice of the parameters is the most likely cause for the different iron abundances .    in conclusion ,",
    "the presented literature comparisons ( see also section  [ sec : iron ] ) generally support the results obtained with our data and method .",
    "there are marginal disagreements for x  ari and uy  eri , that can be at least partially explained by the different assumptions on atmospheric parameters , as discussed above .",
    "we have analysed a sample of 21 variable stars  mostly rrab , with one rrc , two bl  her and one w  vir  having high - resolution spectra from both proprietary ( uves and sarg ) and archival ( uves , harps , feros , apo ) sets .",
    "the data were taken at random phases and as a consequence several spectra were obtained outside optimal phases , and a few spectra very close to the shock phases .",
    "we performed a classical ew - based abundance analysis with static stellar atmospheric models and obtained consistent metallicities ( section  [ sec : iron ] ) and abundance ratios ( sections  [ sec : ratios ] )  within roughly 0.15  dex  regardless of the phase , even for those spectra very close to the shock phases .",
    "it is interesting to note that the w  vir variable ( tw  cap ) and the two bl  her variables ( uy  eri and v716  oph ) behave exactly like rrab at all phases , and thus appear virtually indistinguishable , from the spectroscopic analysis point of view , at least in the sampled phases . while this result is not surprising , given that the physical mechanism responsible for the pulsation is the same and the stellar parameters are quite similar , this is the first time a sample comprising both rr  lyrae ( rrab and rrc ) and population ii cepheids is analyzed homogeneously .",
    "comparisons with the @xcite and @xcite samples , based on [ fe / h ] calibrations for rr  lyrae , showed a rather satisfactory scatter of roughly 0.20  dex , with no significant offset or phase trend ( section  [ sec : iron ] ) , and comparisons with high - resolution studies ( section  [ sec : lit2 ] ) generally supported our abundance analysis .",
    "iron - peak elements were overall solar , again with no trends with phase and a moderate scatter of roughly 0.15  dex .",
    "an average [ @xmath5/fe]=+0.31@xmath80.19  dex was found over the entire sample , based on mg , ca , ti  i , and ti  ii .",
    "the expected problematic element was silicon , which was discussed in detail in the literature ( see * ? ? ? * for references ) : it was rather difficult to find reliable lines , producing relatively small scatter and a [ si / fe ] abundance independent from the phase .",
    "also , a small but systematic ionization imbalance of @xmath11[cr / fe]@xmath7=0.11@xmath80.11  dex and @xmath11[ti / fe]@xmath7=+0.18@xmath80.10  dex was observed , as reported by previous authors , and most probably caused by uncertainties in the log@xmath12 values .",
    "our spectroscopically derived atmospheric parameters are also broadly consistent with the ones expected from template curves ( sections  [ sec : teff ] , [ sec : grav ] , and [ sec : micro ] ) for rrab and population  ii cepheids , while for u  com , the only rrc in our sample , template curves give a too high t@xmath2 that was not reported in previous work ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , the atmospheric parameters found in the present analysis were broadly consistent with the ones found in the similar analysis performed by @xcite , with scatters around the expected values of roughly @xmath8300  k for t@xmath2 , @xmath80.3  dex for @xmath14 , and @xmath80.4  km / s for v@xmath4 .    in summary ,",
    "a classical ew - based abundance analysis on high - resolution ( r@xmath1530000 ) , high s / n spectra ( s / n@xmath1530 ) is appropriate to study rr  lyrae spectra at all phases , with a possible danger only in the range @xmath10 ( where the abundance ratios could be overestimated , depending on the species ) , and with relatively long exposure times ( up to 45  min ) , provided absorption lines are carefully selected and as long as an error of about 0.100.15  dex is considered acceptable .",
