    "uv observations of euv - detected stars have revealed the presence of about 15 hot white dwarf companions to bright stars in non - interacting binary systems ( e.g. , burleigh , barstow , & fleming 1997 ) . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "these wds are hidden because of their close proximity to much more luminous companions which are main sequence ( spectral type k or earlier ) or evolved stars .",
    "a fascinating variety of objects are known or proposed to contain white dwarf ( wd ) stars in interacting binary systems .",
    "a partial list includes novae , cataclysmic variables , symbiotic stars , ba and ch giants , feige  24-type systems and dwarf carbon stars ( green & margon 1994 ) .",
    "these systems offer great insights to evolution and dynamical processes in binaries .",
    "a number of interacting binary systems where the white dwarf is the primary ( i.e. , optically brightest ) star have also been found among euv - detected systems ( e.g. , 6 close , interacting white dwarf / red dwarf binaries by vennes & thorstensen 1994 ) .",
    "optical or ultraviolet spectral observations are most commonly used to detect companions to wd primaries , by searching for ( 1 ) the presence of narrow balmer line emission overlying the broad smooth balmer absorption of the wd , ( 2 ) a composite white dwarf + main sequence spectrum , or ( 3 ) radial velocity ( rv ) variations .",
    "however , only wds with very close , or intrinsically active companions will be found by method ( 1 ) . for hot white dwarf systems , composite spectra ( 2 )",
    "are only expected to be visible if the companion s spectral type is early enough .",
    "rv variations ( 3 ) require multiple observations at high spectral resolution , and detection strongly favors close and/or massive companions .",
    "all the discoveries mentioned above have been strongly dominated by these selection effects , with companions biased to earlier types than predicted by the simulations of dekool & ritter ( 1993 ) and others . scaling from dekool & ritter s results , vennes & thorstensen ( 1994 ) estimate that `` at least twice as many close binary systems remain to be identified from euv surveys , most of them with a low mass secondary . ''",
    "the resulting sample of binaries known to date therefore must diverge strongly from the intrinsic distribution , in overall normalization , as well as in mass and spectral type of the main sequence companions .    the current study , conceived as a complement to optical studies , began as a near - ir photometric survey for low mass companions to hot white dwarfs ( wds ) . by investigating only euv - detected wds",
    ", we obtain a very reasonably - sized but complete sample of young wds , next to which very late - type dwarf companions can be detected in the near - infrared by searching for a @xmath1 excess over that expected from the white dwarf .",
    "many hot white dwarfs ( @xmath2k ; finley et al . 1993 ) have been detected in the recent euv all - sky surveys .",
    "euv detection of these hot wds depends primarily on their temperature , distance , and the intervening galactic ism .",
    "our sample of euv wds ( whose selection we define below ) offers excellent flux contrast in the ir relative to optical ; cool companions will almost always be brighter in the @xmath1 band than the hot wds .    to know what @xmath1 mag to expect for the wds , we benefit from constraints on log@xmath3 , radius , and @xmath4 derivable from optical spectra for the wds in our sample , using nlte model atmosphere fits ( napiwotzki et al .  1993 ,",
    "napiwotzki 1997 ) .",
    "the resulting predictions for @xmath1 magnitudes allow a direct search for any ir excess from a cool companion . in some cases , ir colors will also provide a preliminary spectral type .",
    "results from the ir survey will be presented in an upcoming paper .",
    "an additional motivation is the study of the white dwarf mass distribution . since the pioneering work of koester , schulz & weidemann ( 1979 ; ksw ) it is well established that the masses of white dwarfs cluster in a narrow range around @xmath5 , remarkable given that white dwarfs stem from progenitors with masses ranging from below @xmath6 up to @xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "precise knowledge of the white dwarf mass distribution puts constraints on the theory of stellar evolution , especially the poorly understood mass loss process during the final stages of stellar evolution . with two recent exceptions ( beauchamp et al .",
    "1996 and dreizler & werner 1996 , who analyzed samples of helium - rich db and do white dwarfs , respectively ) the mass distribution has only been determined for hydrogen - rich da white dwarfs .",
    "however , this is not a severe limitation , because this spectral class comprises about 80% of all known white dwarfs .",
    "the analysis of ksw , along with other follow - up investigations in the early eighties , used photometric data of which the strmgren and greenstein multichannel colors were the most suitable .",
    "both systems provide temperature- and gravity - sensitive indices .",
    "alternatively , ksw and others used trigonometric parallax measurements to directly calculate the stellar radius .",
    "however , the latter method is practical only for a small sample and suffers from considerable measurement uncertainty .",
    "unfortunately , the photometric indices have their highest sensitivity near 10000k . at this temperature",
    "da white dwarfs have a convective atmosphere and the results depend critically on the adopted parameters of mixing length theory .",
    "the situation improved at the beginning of the nineties , when the development of modern , highly efficient detectors made it possible to obtain high - quality spectra of large numbers of white dwarfs and determine the stellar parameters from a fit to the detailed profiles of the balmer lines .",
    "this method yields sufficient accuracy for white dwarfs hot enough to have a radiative envelope .",
    "the first comprehensive sample of white dwarfs analyzed by this method was presented by bergeron , saffer & liebert ( 1992 ; hereafter bsl ) .",
    "as attributed to higher precision of spectroscopic methods , this investigation yielded a white dwarf mass distribution even narrower than found by ksw and other previous studies .",
    "at the same time , kidder ( 1991 ) analyzed a sample of hot da white dwarfs discovered through positional coincidences of catalogued hot da white dwarfs in existing soft x - ray databases .",
    "three soft x - ray sources corresponding to white dwarfs were found , having relatively low effective temperatures , @xmath925,000k , determined independently using complementary optical and uv spectroscopy .",
    "kidder et al .",
    "( 1992 ) analyzed an expanded sample to derive photospheric he abundances for the hotter objects and establish an effective observational low - temperature threshold for the detection of pure hydrogen da white dwarfs at soft x - ray wavelengths .    in 1997",
    "three groups ( marsh et al .",
    "1997 , m97 ; vennes et al .",
    "1997 , v97 ; finley , koester & basri 1997 , fkb ) published results on the mass distribution of extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) selected white dwarfs . due to the selection criterion",
    ", these samples contain the hottest white dwarfs ( @xmath10@xmath11k ) , as cooler white dwarfs do not emit significant euv radiation .",
    "the derived mass distributions in the euv - selected samples are similar to that of bsl , but show some interesting deviations in detail .",
    "the frequency of very high mass white dwarfs is much larger , and that of very low mass white dwarfs much smaller , than in bsl .",
    "these findings can at least partly be explained by selection effects ( see the discussion in fkb ) .",
    "more serious is a trend of the peak mass with temperature .",
    "v97 found that their mass distribution peaks at @xmath12 , while the bsl distribution peaks at @xmath13 , with masses computed using wood s ( 1995 ) mass - radius relation with `` thick '' layers ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "this discrepancy diminishes slightly , if the `` very thin layer '' ( @xmath16 , no hydrogen layer ) mass - radius relations are used ( peak masses of @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the v97 and bsl sample , respectively ) .",
    "v97 interpreted this as evidence for a very thin hydrogen layer of the da white dwarfs .",
    "however , the effects are small so this result depends strongly on the accuracy of the derived stellar parameters .",
    "fkb estimated the internal accuracy of different analysis methods from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the precision reachable by balmer line fitting is very compelling : @xmath19 @xmath10/ @xmath10@xmath20 for @xmath10@xmath21k .",
    "however , for spectra with very high signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) , errors introduced by details of the observation and reduction techniques ( e.g. , extraction , flat fielding , flux and wavelength calibration ) might be more important , but are very difficult to determine .",
    "additionally , one has to take into account differences in the model atmosphere calculations and fitting procedure . together with the results presented in this paper",
    ", we now have four samples of hot white dwarfs , analyzed in a similar way , and with significant overlap .",
    "this offers the opportunity to determine the real accuracy of the spectral analysis of hot white dwarfs , including many possible systematic effects .",
    "we present the selection criteria of our sample in sect .  2 and the observations and data reduction procedures in sect .",
    "details on our model atmospheres are given in sect .",
    "the results and a detailed comparison with the previous analyses of euv selected white dwarfs are presented in sect .",
    "we finish with a discussion of our results and an outlook .",
    "we chose to limit our uniform sample to das , for which models provide the best temperature and mass constraints .",
    "we start with 73 known da white dwarfs in the euve bright source list ( malina et al .",
    "excluding sources at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath22 ) and southerly declinations ( @xmath23 ) yields a list of 28 das . a similar procedure for non - overlapping das listed in the _ rosat _ wide field camera survey bright source catalogue ( pounds et al . 1993 ) yields 29 objects .",
    "we have removed from our uniform sample 2 well - known stars with published sensitive optical spectrophotometry and ir photometry ( feige  24 and hz  43 ) .",
    "two das with broad line profiles due to magnetic splitting were also excluded ( pg1658 + 441 and pg0136 + 251 ) .",
    "eight known binaries are also excluded from the uniform sample : v471  tau ( vennes , christian , & thorstensen 1998 ) , pg0824@xmath24289 , ( heber et al . 1993 ) hd74389b ( liebert , bergeron , & saffer 1990 ) , rej1016@xmath25052 ( v97 ) , pg1033 + 464 ( gd123 ) , ( green , schmidt , & liebert 1986 ) , rej1426@xmath24500 ( v97 ) , rej1629 + 780 ( catalan et al . 1995 ) , and ik  peg ( wonnacott et al . 1993 ) , leaving 47 objects .    in this paper , a handful of objects which fell outside the uniform sample definitions just outlined were included for observation .",
    "these include the known binaries pg1033 + 464 and rej1629 + 780 and the magnetic white dwarf pg1658 + 441 , as well as mct0455 - 2812 which was outside the sample declination limits .",
    "due to observing constraints ( a combination of weather , poor seeing and faint objects , or celestial placement of objects ) no spectra were obtained for sample objects rej0443 - 034 , rej0916 - 194 , or pg1040 + 451 .",
    "pg1234 + 482 was originally classified as a sdb star and thus excluded ; it has since been reclassified as a da ( jordan et al .",
    "the final sample we analyze here thus includes 46 da white dwarf stars for which we present new model nlte fits to optical spectra .",
    "we note that since the sample selection was performed , several relevant discoveries pertaining to sample objects have been made .",
    "rej0134 - 160 ( gd984 ) has central balmer emission components produced by a dme companion .",
    "rej1440 + 750 turns out to be a magnetic da ( dreizler et al .",
    "1994 ) . the uniform sample will be discussed in a followup paper treating the ir photometry and binary fraction .",
    "dates are listed for all observations in table  [ t : results ] . on the nights of 04 - 06 january 1996 we obtained spectra at steward observatory s kitt peak station using the bok 2.3-m reflector equipped with the boller &",
    "chivens cassegrain spectrograph and uv - flooded loral 800@xmath261200 ccd .",
    "most spectra were dispersed with a 600 @xmath27/mm first - order grating used behind a 4.5@xmath284@xmath29 long slit . the instrumentation provided wavelength coverage @xmath3034005600 at a spectral resolution of @xmath315fwhm . on the last night of the observing run we employed a new 400 l / mm grating providing wavelength coverage @xmath3035006790 at a spectral resolution of @xmath317  fwhm .",
    "we also obtained spectra at the mmt on mt hopkins , 09 - 11 may 1996 , using the 300  @xmath27/mm grating in first order on the loral 3k@xmath321k ccd of the blue channel spectrograph .",
    "this yields coverage from about 3350 to 8800   , and the 2@xmath33 slit width we used resulted in a spectral resolution of about 4   fwhm .",
    "several objects were kindly obtained for us using the identical instrumental configuration at the mmt by perry berlind on 08 april 1997 .",
    "exposures at both telescopes ranged from one to thirty minutes for program stars , and for all observations the long slit was rotated to the parallactic angle according to the calculations of filippenko ( 1982 ) .",
    "the airmasses were held below 1.5 in almost all cases .",
    "all spectra were extracted from the two - dimensional images and reduced to linear wavelength and intensity scales using standard reduction packages in the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "these operations included bias subtraction , flat field division by images obtained by exposing on dome or internal quartz lamps , centroiding and summation of the stellar traces on the two - dimensional images , sky subtraction , wavelength calibration using spectra of he / ar arc lamps , and absolute flux calibration using the flux standards of massey et al .",
    "details of these reduction procedures are given by bsl .",
    "we present in figs .",
    "[ f : steward ] and  [ f : mmt ] our collection of white dwarf spectra .",
    "the spectra obtained at the steward observatory 2.3 m telescope are found in fig .",
    "[ f : steward ] , and the mmt spectra in fig .",
    "[ f : mmt ] .",
    "some stars observed repeatedly appear in both figures .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of our spectra ranges from 35 to 200 with an average of 90 .",
    "ninety percent of our spectra have a s / n of at least 45 .",
    "we calculate hydrogen model atmospheres with the nlte code developed by werner ( 1986 ) .",
    "basic assumptions are those of static , plane - parallel atmospheres in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium . in contrast to the atmospheres",
    "commonly used to analyze da white dwarfs , we relax the assumption of local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) and solve the detailed statistical equilibrium instead . as described in werner ( 1986 ) , the accelerated lambda iteration ( ali ) method is used to solve the set of non - linear equations . the impact of nlte on white dwarf atmospheres is discussed in detail in napiwotzki ( 1997 ) .",
    "levels and lines are included in nlte up to @xmath34 .",
    "line blanketing by the stark broadened hydrogen lines is taken into account consistently .",
    "as the hydrogen atmospheres of da white dwarfs are stable for @xmath10@xmath35k , convection is not included in our atmospheric models .",
    "pressure dissolution of the higher levels is described by the hummer & mihalas ( 1988 ) occupation probability formalism following the nlte implementation by hubeny et al .",
    "the synthetic spectra are computed with the extended vcs broadening tables ( vidal et al .",
    "1970 ) provided by schning & butler ( priv .",
    "comm . ) and lemke ( 1997 ) .",
    "we followed the prescription of bergeron ( 1993 ) and increased the critical ionizing field adopted to calculate the occupation probability by a factor two .",
    "the motivation is not a flaw in the hummer & mihalas ( 1988 ) formalism , but a compensation for the inadequacy of the standard stark broadening theory when line wings overlap .",
    "our nlte model grid covers the temperature range 17000k @xmath36 @xmath10@xmath37100000k ( stepsize increasing with @xmath10 from 2000k to 10000k ) and gravity range @xmath38 ( stepsize 0.25 ) .",
    "although deviations from lte are small for most da white dwarfs they become significant for the hottest stars in our sample ( cf .",
    "napiwotzki 1997 ) .",
    "since we intend to compare our results with three other samples analyzed by means of lte atmospheres , we have produced a map with lte correction vectors .",
    "for this purpose we calculated a set of lte model atmospheres using the technique described in napiwotzki ( 1997 ) of drastically enhancing collisional rates between the atomic levels in the nlte code .",
    "this forces the occupation numbers to be in lte and guarantees consistency with the nlte atmospheres .",
    "the synthetic lte spectra were transformed into `` observed '' spectra by convolving them with a gaussian of 5  fwhm , rebinning them to 2 and adding poisson noise corresponding to a continuum s / n of 100 .",
    "these simulated spectra were analyzed with the nlte grid following the procedure outlined in sect .",
    "[ s : analysis ] .",
    "1000 simulations were run for every parameter set to eliminate the effect of random errors .",
    "the resulting offsets are displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : ltevectors ] .",
    "the orientation of the vectors corresponds to the correction , which must be applied to transform lte results to the nlte scale .    as expected from the results of napiwotzki ( 1997 ) the differences are negligible for da white dwarfs cooler than @xmath940000k , but can be significant for hotter stars .",
    "the lte vectors show the trend that nlte effects increase with increasing temperature and decreasing gravity ( see e.g.  fig .  3 and  4 in napiwotzki , 1997 , for the case of da white dwarfs ) .",
    "the small corrections found for the models with the highest temperature and lowest gravity seems to contradict this behavior .",
    "a look at the line profiles reveals that the nlte deviations are larger for , say , the @xmath10@xmath39k , @xmath40 model than the 70000k , 8.0 model .",
    "however , the correction vectors are not a simple function of nlte deviations measured e.g.  as equivalent width difference , but depend also on the way line profiles vary with temperature and gravity .",
    "the small corrections found for the high temperature / low gravity models are produced by the cancellation of these effects .",
    "we expect a reliable transformation between the lte and nlte temperature scales only if the deviations are not too large .",
    "a conservative upper limit is @xmath970000k .",
    "a thorough comparison with the previous lte analyses is presented in sect .",
    "[ s : comparison ] .",
    "we checked our models by a comparison of our lte spectra with some da model spectra kindly provided by d.  koester .",
    "model parameters were @xmath41k to 70000k in 10000k steps and @xmath42 for pure hydrogen models .",
    "input physics are very similar .",
    "in particular both model calculations adopt twice the critical ionizing field for the calculation of line profiles .",
    "we treated koester s model spectra the same way we treated the lte spectra above and fitted them with our lte grid .",
    "the result was quite satisfactory : the temperature differences were always below 1.5% and the gravity differences never exceeded 0.03dex .",
    "metals were ignored in our calculations , but they can modify the hydrogen line profiles by their effect on the atmospheric structure .",
    "lanz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) analyzed the balmer lines of the hot da g191b2b with pure hydrogen lte and nlte atmospheres and an nlte model with full metal line blanketing .",
    "they concluded that the effect of metal line blanketing on the balmer lines was relatively small , and the difference between lte and nlte was found to be the most important effect . a recent study by barstow et al .  ( 1998 ) , which investigated several hot white dwarfs in the temperature range around 60000k derived larger metal line blanketing effects of the order of the nlte effects . since the lte analyses of m97 , v97 , and fkb are based on pure hydrogen models , our results should be consistent with theirs in any case",
    "atmospheric parameters of our da white dwarfs are obtained by simultaneously fitting line profiles of the observed balmer lines with the nlte model spectra described above .",
    "we use the least - square algorithm described in bsl . the observed and theoretical balmer line profiles are normalized to a linear continuum ( both spectra are @xmath43 ) in a consistent manner .",
    "wavelength shifts are determined with a cross - correlation method and applied consistently to each complete spectrum .",
    "the synthetic spectra are convolved to the observational resolution with a gaussian and interpolated to the actual parameters with bicubic splines , and interpolated to the observed wavelength scale .",
    "the atmospheric parameters @xmath10 and @xmath44 are then determined by minimizing the @xmath45 value by means of a levenberg - marquardt steepest descent algorithm ( press et al .",
    "several tests revealed that our interpolation routine is rather robust concerning spacing of our model grid and yields reliable results even at the edge of the model grid .",
    "finally , an estimate of the internal errors can be derived from the covariance matrix .",

    "consequently , the derived mass distribution will be narrower , if evolutionary layer masses are used .",
    "the lower mass limit for a c / o core white dwarf is @xmath95 , the limiting mass for central helium burning in low mass stars ( sweigart et al .",
    "thus , white dwarfs with a lower mass possess a helium core . at the current age of the universe",
    "he white dwarfs have not been produced by single star evolution , but are the result of binary evolution where the hydrogen - rich envelope was stripped away along the ( first ) red giant branch ( kippenhahn 1967 ; iben & tutukov 1986 ) .",
    "we use the recent evolutionary models of he white dwarfs calculated by driebe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) based on this scenario .    the combined tracks of blcker ( 1995 ) and driebe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) cover the mass range @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "we supplemented this set with the 1.0 , 1.1 , and @xmath98 carbon core sequences of wood ( 1995 ) with `` thin '' layers .",
    "since the hydrogen envelope mass decreases with increasing white dwarf mass in blcker s models , their highest mass models effectively correspond to `` thin layer '' models .",
    "since high mass white dwarfs are already close to the zero - temperature configuration , the remaining departures from consistent evolutionary calculations can be ignored for practical purposes .    the position of the analyzed white dwarfs in the temperature / gravity plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : tracks ] along with the tracks used for the mass determination .",
    "the individual white dwarf masses are given in table  [ t : results ] , and the resulting mass distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : mass ] .",
    "we have also redetermined masses for the bsl sample with the blcker / driebe mass - radius relations and supplement fig .",
    "[ f : mass ] with the resulting distribution .",
    "our mass distribution possesses the same basic features as found in the euv selected samples of m97 , v97 , and fkb .",
    "the sharp peak centered at @xmath99 is in principal agreement with the earlier investigations of ksw , weidemann & koester ( 1984 ) , and bsl , with a sharp falloff towards lower masses , and a less steep decline towards higher masses with a tail of high mass white dwarfs . considering the relatively large observational scatter we found in sect .",
    "[ s : comparison ] , the _ underlying _ distribution may be extremely sharp .",
    "the mean mass is @xmath100 .",
    "however , this value is strongly biased by the few very high mass white dwarfs .",
    "we decided to follow the recipe of fkb and fitted the mass peak with a gaussian .",
    "although a gaussian is not a good representation of the white dwarf mass distribution , it gives a robust estimate of the peak mass .",
    "the fit result is , in principle , dependent on the adopted binning of the mass intervals .",
    "however , in some test calculations we found effects exceeding a few @xmath101 only if the bin width was larger than @xmath102 .",
    "the values given in this paper were derived by fitting gaussians to virtually unbinned mass distributions ( formal bin width @xmath101 ) .",
    "we were concerned by the possibility that the different fraction of low and high mass white dwarfs found in different samples ( see discussion below ) may skew the gaussian fit of the main peak to higher or lower masses .",
    "we tested this by fitting the bsl , and fkb and our mass distributions with multi - component gaussians , which fitted the secondary high and low mass peaks separately .",
    "we found no deviation higher than @xmath103 in any case and concluded that the single gaussian fit of the main peak yields a rather stable estimate .    with this method",
    ", we derived a peak mass of our sample of @xmath104 .",
    "we reanalysed the fkb , m97 , and v97 samples with our mass - radius relations .",
    "we applied the corrections to nlte and excluded the white dwarfs with temperatures in excess of 70000k .",
    "the peaks masses are @xmath105 ( fkb ) , @xmath106 ( m97 ) , and 0.582 ( v97 ) .",
    "these differences reflect the systematic differences in @xmath76 and @xmath44 determinations discussed above and probably different selection criteria in the case of fkb .    the probable he core white dwarf rej0512 - 004 is the only object in our sample with a mass below @xmath107 , but four white dwarfs have masses in excess of @xmath108 .",
    "the frequency of low and high mass white dwarfs found in our and other euv selected samples is qualitatively different from that found in optically selected samples such as bsl .",
    "bsl detected in their sample of 129 white dwarfs 16 objects with masses below the limiting mass for c / o core white dwarfs and a total of 28 white dwarfs with @xmath109 .",
    "these numbers are reduced to 10 and 16 respectively , if we redetermine the masses with the mass - radius relations of blcker ( 1995 ) and driebe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . however , that is still a much higher fraction than we find in our euv selected sample .      why do optical and euv selected samples contain different fractions of high and low mass white dwarfs ?",
    "all helium white dwarfs from the bsl sample have temperatures below 30000k ; the only helium white dwarf candidate in our sample has @xmath11032000k .",
    "this implies that the detection probability of low mass white dwarfs in euv selected samples is much lower , because the fraction of low mass white dwarfs at higher @xmath76 is much lower than it is for @xmath71k .",
    "this viewpoint is supported by the helium white dwarf sequences calculated by driebe et al .",
    "we have plotted the variation of temperatures with time for white dwarfs with helium and c / o cores in fig .",
    "[ f : tevol ] .",
    "the detection probability in a given evolutionary stage goes as the inverse of the rate of temperature decrease at that stage .",
    "new he white dwarfs cool down rapidly to a certain ( mass dependent ) temperature , whereafter the cooling rate drops drastically and the star remains on a temperature plateau for a long time .",
    "this behavior is most pronounced for the lowest masses .",
    "hydrogen shell burning plays an important role for this plateau phase .",
    "although the energy production by hydrogen burning drops down dramatically after the star enters the white dwarf sequence , it still produces a significant fraction of the total luminosity , enough to bring the cooling to a standstill .",
    "we can conclude from fig .",
    "[ f : tevol ] that it is extremely unlikely to detect a helium white dwarf during its first rapid cooling phase .",
    "it is easier to find them during their plateau phase or afterwards .",
    "this means there is a strong bias towards detecting helium white dwarfs in samples of relatively `` cool '' da stars ( like bsl ) instead of the overall much hotter euv selected samples .",
    "we can explain in a similar fashion why high mass white dwarfs are found preferentially in the @xmath111k range .",
    "due to the drop in neutrino cooling , the evolutionary speeds of massive white dwarfs are relatively low in this range , as demonstrated by the @xmath112 track , the most massive stellar remnant calculated by blcker ( 1995 ) .",
    "this increases the detection probability of more massive white dwarfs in euv selected samples .",
    "even if we restrict our comparisons to hot subsamples of white dwarfs , the fraction of massive white dwarfs is much higher in the euv selected samples than it is in optically selected ones .",
    "an extensive discussion of this problem is carried out by fkb .",
    "fkb argue that the number of high mass white dwarfs discovered per sky area is similar for the whole sky euv surveys and the optical palomar - green ( pg ) survey ( green et al .",
    "1986 ) , which covered roughly 25% of the sky .",
    "in other words , a whole sky version of the pg survey should have discovered all but one of the euv detected white dwarfs with @xmath113 . at a given temperature ,",
    "white dwarfs with lower masses are larger , consequently more luminous , and detectable to larger distances .",
    "for instance at 30000k , a white dwarf of @xmath107 is detectable at distances @xmath114 larger than a @xmath115 white dwarf . at the maximum distance sampled by ,",
    "e.g. , the pg survey , the probability is very high that interstellar matter effectively absorbs all euv radiation .",
    "thus the dominant effect in euv surveys is not a selection for massive white dwarfs as suggested by v97 , but a selection _ against _ low mass white dwarfs , due to a sample volume strongly affected by interstellar absorption .",
    "fkb noted a moderate apparent trend of the white dwarf peak mass with temperature .",
    "since their sample also included optically selected white dwarfs , they analyzed a considerably higher fraction of stars with @xmath116k and therefore have a larger temperature baseline than pure euv samples .",
    "analogous to this finding , v97 found an @xmath117 offset between the peak of the mass distribution in their euv selected sample and the ( cooler ) white dwarfs analyzed by bsl . in both cases this temperature dependence decreases if wood s models with `` very thin '' layers ( @xmath16 , no hydrogen layer ) instead of the canonical thick layer models ( @xmath118 ) are used .",
    "however , part of the trend noted in v97 may be related to the systematic differences between the analyses discussed in sect  5.3 .",
    "since v97 compared results from two different analyses , it is not possible to judge if the offset is real or just an artifact .",
    "the case of fkb is stronger , because they based their case on a homogeneously analyzed sample .",
    "fkb warned that the temperature dependence of the mass distribution peak may be caused by inadequacies remaining in the model atmospheres . a more detailed discussion is given in the next section .",
    "some evidence that part of the temperature trend stems from the analyses comes from our intercomparisons presented in sect  5.3 .",
    "we showed that systematic differences between the four investigated samples exist that vary with effective temperature .",
    "this might mimic a temperature dependence of the sample peak mass .",
    "a gravity offset of 0.1dex transforms into mass offsets of 0.050@xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 for a @xmath5 white dwarf with 25000k , 40000k , and 60000k , respectively .",
    "even a relatively small systematic @xmath44 difference of 0.05dex ( cf.table  [ t : dlogg ] ) corresponds to a @xmath122 offset .",
    "the scatter @xmath46 of _ individual _ gravity determinations reported in table  [ t : scatter ] corresponds to @xmath123 , nearly independent of @xmath76 .",
    "another part of the @xmath76 dependence of the mass peak may be caused by the use of wood s cooling tracks by fkb and v97 .",
    "these tracks are not completely self - consistent since not all model sequences were not calculated _ ab initio _ from the main sequence .",
    "this is not important for cooler white dwarfs but may cause deviations from _ ab initio _ tracks especially for the hottest white dwarfs , where structure depends sensitively on the evolutionary history ( blcker & schnberner 1990 ) .",
    "we redetermined the masses of the bsl white dwarfs with the blcker / driebe mass - radius relations and derived a peak mass of @xmath124 .",
    "that is @xmath117 lower than our peak mass , but having in mind the range of mass determination derived for the euve selected samples , we can not consider this a significant difference .",
    "fkb divided their sample into cool ( @xmath125k ) and a hot ( 35000k @xmath12675000k ) subsamples and derived a @xmath127 higher peak mass for the hot sample .",
    "our reanalysis of the fkb lte results with the blcker / driebe mass - radius relation yields virtually the same offset : @xmath128 .",
    "however , the difference is brought down to @xmath129 ( @xmath130 vs.  @xmath131 ) if we apply corrections to nlte .",
    "one can imagine that a difference of this order ( if significant at all ) can easily be produced by our neglect of metallicity effects ( cf .",
    "lanz et al .",
    "1996 , barstow et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "therefore , given the combination of sample selection and systematic effects in analyses to date , our results do not confirm the presence of intrinsic , systematic mass differences between hot and cool white dwarfs .",
    "we have obtained temperatures , gravities , and masses for a sample of 46 extreme ultraviolet selected da white dwarfs .",
    "these data complement a near infrared survey for low mass companions .",
    "the stellar parameters were determined by fitting the hydrogen balmer line profiles with nlte model spectra .",
    "a map of lte correction vectors was constructed , which allows the transformation of lte results to the nlte scale .",
    "these shifts become important for temperatures above 50000k ( see also napiwotzki 1997 ) .",
    "three recent analyses of da white dwarfs have a considerable overlap with our sample and allow a direct check for systematic errors and individual measurement scatter .",
    "although all four analyses applied similar model atmospheres and fitting techniques , we recognized systematic shifts up to 5% in temperature and 0.1dex in gravity determinations .",
    "these systematic errors have to be considered when the results are interpreted and compared to other studies .",
    "the individual measurement errors increase with temperature : @xmath132 from 2.3% to 3.3% and @xmath133 from 0.07dex to 0.13dex . this is larger than the typical errors computed with @xmath45 fit procedures for a well - exposed spectrum and",
    "indicates that accuracy is limited by noise in combination with other effects such as details of the extraction , fluxing or normalization procedures .",
    "it is unclear if these @xmath46 values indicate lower limits , or scale ( at least partially ) with the s / n ratio of the spectra .",
    "it will be a challenge to resolve this question .",
    "repeated observations performed by one observer , at one telescope , reduced the same way and analysed with one method as performed by bsl , fkb , and us ( table  2 ) do not reveal all effects .",
    "independent observations analysed independently are necessary .",
    "masses have been inferred from theoretical mass - radius relations based on the evolutionary calculations of blcker ( 1995 ) for c / o white dwarfs and driebe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for he white dwarfs",
    ". an important feature of these calculations are the hydrogen and helium layer masses which depend on stellar mass .",
    "we find a sharp peak centered at @xmath9@xmath0 in agreement with the previous investigations of ksw and bsl .",
    "we redetermined masses of the bsl white dwarfs with the blcker / driebe mass - radius relation and derived a peak mass of @xmath134 . at first glance",
    "this seems to confirm the systematic offset reported by v97 .",
    "however , this offset could be explained by systematic differences of the model atmosphere analyses as well .",
    "our reanalysis of the homogeneous fkb sample showed that the temperature dependence of the mass peak nearly vanishes , when corrected for their lte assumption .",
    "we conclude that the observational data presented here and in similar studies are well explained by canonical stellar evolution theory , i.e. white dwarfs with thick envelopes .",
    "we find only one object ( rej0512 - 004 ) with a mass below @xmath107 , which is a possible helium core white dwarf , but four white dwarfs with masses in excess of @xmath108 .",
    "this ratio of high- and low - mass white dwarfs is quite different from that found by bsl .",
    "this can partly be understood as the result of variable evolutionary time scales of high and low mass white dwarfs .",
    "we agree with fkb that another part can be explained by a selection _ against _ low mass white dwarfs in euv selected samples .",
    "the principal aim of our project is the search for and study of cool main sequence companions of our white dwarf sample .",
    "five white dwarfs already show red contamination in our optical spectra . a comprehensive discussion of these and other binaries will be given in a forthcoming paper presenting ir photometry for the white dwarf sample . in this article we provided the basic white dwarf data necessary to interpret our binary sample .",
    "we thank t.  driebe , f.  herwig , and t. blcker for providing us with their tracks and computing the white dwarf masses and d.koester , who made some model spectra available for our model comparison .",
