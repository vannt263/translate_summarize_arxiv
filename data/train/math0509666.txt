    "many reaction processes in nature and engineering take place in a moving fluid .",
    "the creation of ozone in the atmosphere , the nuclear explosion of a supernova , pattern formation in morphogenesis , wild fires , and the gasoline transformation in an internal combustion engine are just a few examples",
    ". the effect of fluid flow on a reaction process can be profound , especially if the flow is strong .",
    "the problem has been studied for many years by engineers , physicists , and mathematicians alike .",
    "one of the most extensively studied mathematical models of the premixed reaction process is the reaction - diffusion equation and systems .",
    "the advection - reaction - diffusion equation is given by @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the fluid flow , which we will assume is time - independent and passive .",
    "the coefficient @xmath2 is the flow strength parameter , @xmath3 is the diffusivity , @xmath4 is the reaction strength , and @xmath5 is the reaction term .",
    "the function @xmath6 is normalized so that @xmath7 and can stand for normalized temperature , the mass fraction of a reactant , or a share of a population with a certain feature , depending on the problem .",
    "classical works of fisher and kolmogorov - petrovski - piskunov ( kpp ) @xcite first considered equation in the dimension @xmath8 and with @xmath9 .",
    "these works modeled the propagation of an advantageous gene in the population , and established existence and , in a certain sense , stability of the traveling fronts .",
    "the extensions have occupied some of the best efforts of mathematicians since .",
    "equation in several spacial dimensions in the absence of advection ( @xmath9 ) is by now fairly well understood : the existence of traveling waves , stability , and asymptotic propagation properties have been extensively studied ( see , e.g. @xcite where many more references can be found ) .",
    "the effects of advection , however , are very important in many situations in combustion and more general chemical reactions @xcite as well as in biology and ecology @xcite .",
    "one important phenomena that is observed in many situations is the enhancement of the reaction rate by fluid motion .",
    "the physical reason for this observed speed - up is believed to be that fluid advection tends to increase the area available for reaction .",
    "recently , there has been significant progress in the mathematical understanding of the reaction rate enhancement for several different classes of flows @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite provide excellent reviews of some of these results and further references .    in this paper , our goal is to study reaction enhancement within a framework of a model given by a coupled system of one - dimensional advection - reaction - diffusion equations : @xmath10 @xmath11 we assume that the model is periodic in @xmath12 that is , in the equation for @xmath13 we replace @xmath14 with @xmath15 and in the equation for @xmath15 we put @xmath16 instead of @xmath17 the initial data always satisfies @xmath18 and it is a simple consequence of the maximum principle that @xmath19 remains within these bounds for all times ( see section  [ aux ] ) . our reaction term is the classical kpp @xcite , and for simplicity we set @xmath20 ( these parameters are normalized by a simple rescaling of time and space ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 which corresponds to the mean zero flow .",
    "any nonzero mean is taken into account by switching to a moving system of coordinates ; we are interested in a non trivial effect of front stretching rather than simple transfer with a constant speed . one can regard as a model for reaction in a layered fluid , where different layers move with different speeds .",
    "the role of the parameter @xmath22 is to provide diffusive coupling between different layers , and its meaning will be further discussed in section  [ main ] .",
    "our main interest is in the case of the large coefficients @xmath23 , where the influence of the drift is most pronounced .",
    "we consider the front - like initial data where @xmath24 as @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath27 exponentially fast ( we will state the exact conditions in section  [ aux ] ) .",
    "we adopt the following natural quantity ( called the bulk burning rate in @xcite ) as the main measure of the reaction rate : @xmath28 one of the results that we prove is as follows .",
    "[ main1 ] assume that the initial data @xmath29 are front like",
    ". then there exists a universal constant @xmath30 such that for any @xmath31 we have @xmath32^{-1}.\\ ] ]    there are several noteworthy properties the lower bound possesses .",
    "firstly , the bound is linear in the flow strength .",
    "secondly , the estimate clearly shows the need to wait for a certain time @xmath33 before the front propagation ( and thus the reaction rate ) stabilizes and the long - time lower bound is achieved .",
    "if the coupling constant @xmath34 is large , we have the lower bound @xmath35 starting from times @xmath36 if @xmath34 is small , the lower bound is @xmath37 starting from times @xmath38 we interpret these results further in sections  [ main ] and [ num ] .",
    "the numerical experiments discussed in section  [ num ] show very good qualitative agreement with .",
    "we remark that the result of theorem  [ main1 ] is reminiscent of the bounds proved in @xcite for the two dimensional equation with a shear flow @xmath39 this is not surprising since our system can be regarded as a discrete model of a shear flow .",
    "however , the proofs in the case of model are conceptually much more transparent , the estimates are more precise , and the dependence on the averaging time is more explicit .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ aux ]",
    "we collect some background estimates which are needed in the proof of main results .",
    "in particular , we prove a sharp version of a functional inequality which was first discovered in @xcite .",
    "the inequality is somewhat reminiscent of the indeterminacy principle of quantum mechanics .",
    "although finding a sharp constant is not particularly important for the key results of this paper , we feel that the result is elegant ( even if elementary ) and may be of independent interest . in section  [ two ]",
    "we discuss a simpler two - layer case . in section  [ main ] we prove theorem  [ main1 ] , and some related results for a slightly more general model . in section  [ num ]",
    "we describe the numerical simulations .",
    "we make our model slightly more general by associating a width @xmath40 with each layer . by dimensionality of the discrete gradient terms providing coupling of the neighboring layers in",
    ", the parameter @xmath34 is made to depend on @xmath41 with @xmath42 @xmath43 the parameter @xmath3 now plays the role of diffusivity between the layers .",
    "as opposed to the diffusivity in @xmath44 direction , this diffusion coefficient can not be set to one by a simple rescaling .",
    "our mean zero flow condition now reads @xmath45 set @xmath46    we first prove a lemma on the preservation of spacial decay of the solutions of that will allow us to manipulate the equations , in particular integrate by parts .",

    "these manipulations are justified by lemma  [ decay ] . in the last step we use the expression and the fact that @xmath80    as a warm up before our main results , we prove the following estimate .",

    "we find that @xmath91 changing the variable and taking into account the asymptotic behavior of @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 the latter integral is computed explicitly by setting @xmath94 , and evaluates to @xmath95 .",

    "note that if @xmath96 , then @xmath97 we can solve for @xmath92 explicitly and use the solution to construct an explicit function satisfying the necessary asymptotic behavior for which the equality in is achieved .",

    "theorem  [ general ] gives a universal lower bound on the reaction rate , independent of the flow .",
    "one consequence is that in the framework of our model , a mean zero flow can not quench the reaction .",
    "however , we are interested in the bounds that show enhancement of the reaction",
    ". we will prove such bounds in the next two sections .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we start with a simplified version of our general model where only two layers of unit width are involved . namely , we look at a system @xmath102 with the initial data @xmath103 satisfying .",
    "we set @xmath104 in the definition of the bulk burning rate . throughout the rest of the paper",

    "the implementation features two noteworthy modifications .",
    "firstly , the transient wave that occurs between the initial condition and the eventual steady wavefront shape was ignored when calculating the front speed .",
    "this was achieved by using a `` @xmath175 '' parameter , and then ignoring the wave speed for times @xmath176 to @xmath175 . secondly , we employed a computational trick to expedite simulation . in a naive implementation",

    "can be computationally expensive .",
    "we avoided this by only applying crank - nicholson to points in the immediate neighborhood of the front itself .",
    "then after every iteration we adjusted our calculation frame to stay centered on the wavefront .",
    "we found clear linear dependence on the flow strength parameter @xmath179 the figure  [ lin ] shows this linear dependence for different values of the coupling constant @xmath174 the constant @xmath3 varies from @xmath180 to @xmath181 with @xmath180 step .",
    "the slope of the graph is monotone decreasing in @xmath182 so that the steeper slopes on figure  [ lin ] correspond to smaller values of @xmath174 the intuitive explanation for this effect is that stronger diffusion between layers mollifies the front stretching produced by the flow , thus reducing the reaction zone .",
    "the graph on figure  [ slopes ] shows the dependence of slope on @xmath174 the shape of the graph is in good qualitative agreement with the bound of theorem  [ 2layer ] .",
