    "70% in a cosmological constant , observed through an apparent accelerated universal expansion at low redshifts .",
    "however , there is still room for sizeable deviations from the concordance picture .",
    "for example , current data allow for the dominant energy contribution to have properties quite different from that of a cosmological constant . although the equation of state , relating the pressure and the density by a linear relation , @xmath1 , is probably close to the cosmological constant value @xmath2 at low redshifts , it may have very different properties at higher redshifts  @xcite .    a dark energy component with @xmath3 not only allows for a time varying energy density , but will also exhibit spatial fluctuations . in recent years",
    ", several studies have been carried out concerning clustering properties of different dark energy models ( see , e.g. , mota  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "depending on the dark energy model employed , clustering can occur on very different scales and at different amplitudes and have different couplings to the dark matter clustering . as a concrete example of clustering scales and amplitudes in the non - linear regime ,",
    "it was shown in mota  @xcite that the density contrast of a dark energy scalar field can be of order @xmath4 in voids of radii @xmath5  mpc .",
    "the clustering can be anti - correlated with the dark matter clustering , which is the case for , e.g. , a quintessence field with a quadratic potential in the linear regime  @xcite .",
    "clustering of dark energy may also affect structure growth in the dark matter component by , e.g. , introducing modifications to the spherical collapse model  .",
    "in short , there are no definite theoretical predictions on how dark energy will cluster in the universe . coupled to the fact that it is notoriously difficult to measure temporal variations in the dark energy density , this warrants observational constraints on the amount of spatial clustering of dark energy in order to rule out or to further confirm the cosmological constant hypothesis .",
    "dark energy clustering will manifest itself through several different observational effects .",
    "dark energy inhomogeneities will change the form and time evolution of gravitational potentials to affect cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and the late - time integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect , structure growth will be modified , and the properties of collapsed halos can change to affect cluster number counts  .    in this paper we consider how dark energy clustering can affect observations of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) . while the isw effect takes into account the impact local inhomogeneities have on photons arriving from the last scattering surface at redshift @xmath6 , observations of sne  ia probe light propagation out to @xmath7 .",
    "when light from a sn  ia passes through a region where the dark energy density fluctuates , the inferred luminosity distance will change due to the local expansion perturbation that the fluctuation creates .",
    "this will show up as correlated fluctuations in the sn  ia peak magnitudes , where the magnitude correlation amplitudes and angular scales will depend on the specific dark energy clustering amplitudes and scales .",

    "we also point out some of the limitations that the formalism carries .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ data ] , we describe the method to analyse sn  ia magnitude residuals for angular correlations and apply it to current data to establish observational constraints on the amount of correlation . in section  [ fluctuations ] , we develop a theoretical formalism to relate a phenomenological power spectrum of dark energy spatial fluctuations to an angular covariance in the magnitude fluctuations .",

    "the main limitation , however , is that it is currently not possible to calculate exact distances in general inhomogeneous cosmologies , and we will have to rely on simplified models for relating dark energy fluctuations to luminosity distance fluctuations as explained below .",
    "suppose that there is a dark energy density fluctuation field defined by @xmath43 where the bar indicates spatially averaged quantities and @xmath44 denotes directional dependence .",

    "alternatively , one could choose to normalise the local expansion such that the hubble parameter is spatially homogeneous at an earlier time slicing , or to impose a condition of homogeneous big bang time for each local patch . using this setup we can write ( see [ append ] for more details ) @xmath47\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath48 ensures that we have a spatially homogeneous expansion at @xmath49 .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 determine the degree of gravitational growth with redshift of the matter and dark energy density contrast , respectively .",

    "a less restricted setup of the perturbations would also allow for spatially varying curvature , but unfortunately it is currently not possible to calculate exact distances in such a general model .",
    "the presence of dark energy inhomogeneities along the line of sight to a sn  ia will cause fluctuations in the observed peak magnitude , or equivalently , a fractional fluctuation in the luminosity distance , related by @xmath52 the averaged fractional luminosity distance fluctuation integrated over all sources in the direction @xmath44 , out to the most distant sn  ia at comoving distance @xmath53 , is given by a projection of the dark energy fluctuation field down on the celestial sphere , @xmath54_{\\rm",

    "a key assumption in the derivation of the weight function is that the density fluctuations are small , i.e. , dark energy clustering only occurs in the linear regime . here",
    "@xmath58 is the radial distribution of sne  ia , normalised so that @xmath59    to calculate the induced correlations in sn  ia magnitude fluctuations it is enough to know the statistical properties of the fluctuation field .",
    "if the dark energy density contrast is a gaussian random field , these are encoded in the spatial power spectrum @xmath60 , formally defined as @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the comoving wavenumber related to the comoving wavelength @xmath63 by @xmath64 .",
    "the spatial power spectrum of dark energy fluctuations can be related to an angular power spectrum of fractional luminosity distance fluctuations @xmath65 using a projection in the flat - sky approximation involving the same weight function , @xmath66 the angular power spectrum tells us how much fluctuations there are on angular scales @xmath67 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : fullformulapgpdelta ] ) is a projection down on a small patch of the sky that effectively can be considered flat , and is only valid for small angular separations .",
    "this form of the flat - sky angular power spectrum requires that the weight function @xmath55 is fairly constant over the regions of interest and that the correlation lengths are small compared to the integration range .",
    "this relation has been used extensively in relation to galaxy counts  @xcite and weak lensing observations  @xcite .",
    "we note that a more general projection down on the entire celestial sphere , valid for all angular separations , is indeed possible to perform , but is more cumbersome to work with .",
    "since we expect the induced correlations to be largest at small angular separations , equation  ( [ eq : fullformulapgpdelta ] ) is sufficient for this study .",
    "from the angular power spectrum of fractional luminosity distance fluctuations , we calculate the angular covariance function of magnitude fluctuations as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the zeroth order bessel function of the first kind , and the prefactor comes from equation  ( [ eq : apparentmagnitudedisturbance2 ] ) .    in summary , we use equations  ( [ eq : weightfunction ] ) , ( [ eq : fullformulapgpdelta ] ) and ( [ eq : covtheta ] ) to relate the spatial power spectrum of dark energy fluctuations to the angular covariance function of magnitude fluctuations .      in order to apply our formalism to constrain dark energy clustering , we need to specify a power spectrum of dark energy fluctuations that we can use to compare the theoretical covariance from the projected power spectrum with the observational covariance from sn  ia data . as mentioned in the introduction , dark energy clustering is very model dependent .",
    "thus , from a theoretical perspective , it is not possible to predict a single specific power spectrum .",
    "we will therefore use a phenomenological power spectrum @xmath70 which covers the amplitude distribution of different wavenumbers , with a cut - off towards small fluctuation scales and a redshift dependent growth factor .",
    "the specific parameterisation was previously considered in cooray  @xcite and is basically a modified inflation power spectrum .",
    "it is given by @xmath71 here we have also introduced the dimensionless quantity @xmath72 , which gives the contribution to the variance of the fluctuation field per logarithmic interval . the power spectrum has four free parameters which can be constrained by data : @xmath73 gives the fluctuation amplitude on horizon scales ; @xmath74 gives the power law distribution of the fluctuations ; @xmath75 is a cut - off wavenumber above which fluctuations are suppressed ; and @xmath51 is the growth parameter from equation  ( [ eq : alpha ] ) .    in the analysis , we fix the growth parameters to @xmath76 corresponding to a growth directly proportional to the scale factor ( i.e. the density contrast decreases with redshift ) as expected for linear matter fluctuations in a matter dominated universe .",
    "since we only integrate out to @xmath77 in the power spectrum projection , the final results are not sensitive to this choice .",

    "the curves have been normalised so that the variance of the fluctuation field is @xmath85 , since we demand that the density fluctuations are small .",
    "this means that the amplitude @xmath73 has been adjusted for each individual model according to this normalization condition ( see the figure caption for the different values used ) .",
    "also shown for comparison is the linear matter power spectrum calculated using a fitting formula in peacock  @xcite .",
    "the dark energy power spectra all lie below the matter power spectrum .",

    "the redshift cut brings down the total number of sne  ia in the data set from 557 to 392 ( see also figure  [ fig : union2map ] for which sne that are removed ) . the observational limits used in the next section will essentially be unaffected by this cut .",

    "however , as the number of well observed sne  ia increases , it will be possible to discriminate between different phenomenological models .",
    "ten times more sne with small angle separations will suffice to rule out certain models also with small dark energy fluctuations .",
    "larger statistics would also allow for an analysis in terms of correlations in the hubble diagram residuals as a function of spatial distances between sne rather than only angular separations .",
    "at this point , it is important to again point out the fact that the results are not exact in the sense that it is not ( yet ) possible to calculate cosmological distances in general inhomogeneous cosmologies .",
    "this is usually referred to as the backreaction problem , i.e. , how local inhomogeneities backreact on the global expansion  @xcite . in our setup , inhomogeneities produce perturbations in the hubble function with a fixed background expansion . in reality , these inhomogeneities might backreact , due to the non - linear structure of the field equations , to produce a different global expansion rate . in order to obtain what we believe to be at least order of magnitude correct estimates of sn magnitude angular covariance",
    ", we have assumed that local fluctuations in the dark energy density will cause local fluctuations in the hubble expansion that in turn will induce changes in the luminosity distance to a given redshift . in doing this",
    ", we have normalised the local expansion such that @xmath46 , i.e. , the hubble constant does not have spatial variations .",
    "this is accomplished by introducing perturbations in the matter component by hand in the hubble function such that the dark energy clustering is anti - correlated with the matter clustering . in a more refined formalism",
    ", one would like to include the matter and dark energy power spectrum separately .",
    "this would , however , require the inclusion of the simultaneous effect from local perturbations in the matter and dark energy component on the hubble function",
    ". we also note that in our model , even for vanishing dark energy fluctuations , we would still expect an induced covariance from the local perturbations in the expansion history produced by the dark matter fluctuations .",
    "thus , in a more general context , the method presented in this paper is useful for investigating hubble flow perturbations .    moreover , our approach is not valid in the non - linear clustering regime , and as such we can not test phenomenological models with large density fluctuations .",
    "however , since we expect the problem of backreaction to be more severe for non - linear fluctuations , we have considered it superfluous to include the extra complications of allowing for large fluctuations in our simple model",
    ". the formalism also breaks down at close to horizon scales , where dark energy fluctuations could occur . in view of these limitations , we welcome all efforts to solve the problem of the expansion history and light propagation in an inhomogeneous universe",
