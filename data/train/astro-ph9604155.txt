    "recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) have found statistically significant anisotropy at 05 angular scales ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . in earlier letters ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i , and @xcite , hereafter paper  ii ) , we reported on observations of cmbr anisotropy that included two particularly bright features .",
    "the presence of bright , unresolved sources suggested the possibility of foreground point - source contamination , or of non - gaussian fluctuations in the cmbr . in this letter , we present our analysis of these features and a discussion of other work studying their properties .",
    "the msam1 instrument has been described in detail elsewhere ( @xcite ) ; only the most relevant features are given here .",
    "msam1 is a balloon - borne off - axis cassegrain telescope with a nutating secondary mirror and a four - band bolometric radiometer .",
    "the detectors have center frequencies of 5.7 , 9.3 , 16.5 , and 22.6  each with @xmath1  bandwidth .",
    "the beam size of the telescope is 28  fwhm , roughly independent of frequency .",
    "the secondary executes a horizontal four - position square - wave chop ( i.e. , center , left , center , right ) with an amplitude of @xmath2 on the sky .",
    "the telescope is pointed using a combination of torque motors and reaction wheels , referenced to a gyroscope .",
    "the absolute sky location is determined by star camera observation .",
    "the data discussed here were collected during two flights of the msam instrument from palestine , texas ; the first on 1992  june  5 ( msam1 - 92 ) , the second on 1994  june  2 ( msam1 - 94 ) .",
    "these observations have been described in papers i and ii , and are only summarized here . in each flight , the antenna patterns for all four bands were measured by rastering over jupiter .",
    "we determine the location of the antenna pattern within the star camera s field - of - view to within 2   ( post - flight ) by simultaneously observing jupiter in the star camera and the main telescope .",
    "gyroscope drift increases our absolute pointing uncertainty to @xmath3 .",
    "we calibrate our spectral flux density measurements using the measured surface temperatures ( @xcite ) together with jupiter s apparent diameter at the epoch of flight ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the calibration has a 10% overall uncertainty , with relative errors of 14% between bands .",
    "the cmbr observations were made at roughly constant declination @xmath4 , with the central beam covering right ascensions 144169 and 172203 during the msam1 - 92 flight .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath5 square degrees of sky coverage .",
    "the goal of the msam1 - 94 flight was to observe the identical field as msam1 - 92 ; this was nearly achieved , with an average declination difference of @xmath6 .",
    "the coverage in right ascension was somewhat less , extending from 150170 , and 173200 .",
    "except for  [ sec : counterparts ] , all results reported in this letter are based on the msam1 - 92 observations .",
    "the initial data reduction used in this analysis has been reported in papers i and ii ; only the salient features are reviewed here .",
    "note that this letter is based on the reanalyzed version of the msam1 - 92 data including the full instrument covariance matrix ( @xcite ) .",
    "two nearly statistically independent demodulations are formed from the data .",
    "the single - difference demodulation subtracts the right beam from the left beam , and ignores the central beam data ; the double - difference demodulation subtracts the average of the left@xmath7right beams from the central beam .",
    "the single - difference demodulation has an antisymmetric two - lobe response pattern , while the double - difference demodulation has a symmetric three - lobe pattern .",
    "the data are binned by position and angular orientation of the demodulated antenna pattern on the sky . to remove instrumental drift ,",
    "a slowly varying function of time is fit simultaneously with the bins .",
    "the bin size is 012 in position , and 10  in angular orientation .",
    "the dominant sources of brightness contrast expected in our bands are anisotropy in the cmbr , and thermal emission from warm ( @xmath8k ) interstellar dust ( @xcite , @xcite ) . before searching for compact features",
    ", we use one of our spectral degrees of freedom to make a simple correction for the presence of dust emission . unlike our previous analyses for cmbr anisotropy",
    ", here we do not impose a full spectral model on the data .",
    "rather , after a minimal correction for dust contamination , we model the spatial structure of several bright , compact features , and study the spectral nature of those features .",
    "we estimate and subtract the contribution of foreground interstellar dust emission using the 22.6  band , assuming a @xmath9 emissivity rayleigh - jeans spectrum ( the noise estimates in the remaining three bands are adjusted to reflect this subtraction ) . in making this correction",
    ", we assume that the 22.6  band is an uncontaminated monitor of dust .",
    "varying the exponent of the power law emissivity of the dust by @xmath10 has a negligible effect on the final results , compared with the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the dust correction is most important for the 16.5  band , and has little effect at the lower frequencies .      after removing the estimated dust contamination ,",
    "we search the remaining 3 frequency bands for unresolved features using an @xmath11statistic to measure significance .",
    "each band is searched independently , and then the source lists are compared . since the telescope is scanned at roughly constant declination , we parameterize the location of the features as a function only of right ascension , and constrain the central declination of the feature to follow a slow linear function of right ascension .",
    "we begin by calculating the raw @xmath12 of the data in each band , @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the binned data with associated noise covariance @xmath15 , and the sum is over both demodulations as well as bins .",
    "@xmath16 is one of four arbitrary offset parameters corresponding to the two demodulations and two portions of the flight , appropriate to datum @xmath17 .",
    "then , as a function of right ascension @xmath18 , we find the flux density @xmath19 that minimizes @xmath20                               \\wgt                              \\left [ \\rawj - o_j - s_\\nu(\\alpha ) \\beamj \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the value of the beam map ( single or double difference , as appropriate ) centered on observation point @xmath17 , evaluated at right ascension @xmath18 .",
    "the significance of the fitted flux density is determined by forming the statistic , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of degrees of freedom remaining in the data after fitting out the source .",
    "this statistic should be distributed according to an @xmath11-distribution with 1 and @xmath23 degrees of freedom ( @xcite ) , which allows us to calculate the cumulative probability @xmath24 of drawing a value greater than or equal to @xmath11 if the null hypothesis  that the actual value @xmath25were true .",
    "values of @xmath26 are highly unlikely under the null hypothesis , and correspond to significant detections of compact features in the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : significance ] shows @xmath27 and @xmath24 for each of the three frequency bands .",
    "+    since we are plotting the cumulative probability of the null hypothesis being true , lower values of @xmath24 correspond to more significant detections .",
    "we have multiple lobe beam patterns , so a bright unresolved feature will alias to several values of right ascension separated by the 40beam throw .",
    "thus , the clusters of peaks near 15  and 193 do not correspond to multiple features , but rather the aliasing of a single feature into the side beams .",
    "we build a list of candidate unresolved features for each band by iteratively searching for and subtracting the most significant feature , defined here as the maximum value of @xmath27 . after each feature",
    "is subtracted , @xmath19 , and @xmath27 are re - evaluated to help suppress the aliasing in right ascension .",
    "we continue this procedure until @xmath28 , corresponding to @xmath29 .",
    "three candidate features were identified this way for the 5.7 and 9.3  bands .",
    "we allow each feature to be positive or negative , but the three brightest features are all positive .",
    "no features were found at 16.5  which satisfy the @xmath30 requirement .",

    "furthermore , this location corresponds to the brightest warm dust emission in our field . based on this",
    ", we can not rule out the possibility that the 199 feature is be due to galactic dust emission .    from these data alone , either free - free or synchrotron emission gives an acceptable fit , and could explain the detections . this would , however , require implausibly large amplitudes for emission at lower frequencies .",
    "for example , the best fit free - free spectra , extrapolated to 40  ghz ( q - band ) , imply antenna temperatures of 3.4 , 1.1 , and 0.9  mk for the three features ; measurements made at saskatoon of the same field strongly rule out such bright signals ( @xcite ) .",
    "the limits on synchrotron emission are even stronger , since the extrapolated temperatures are roughly 3 times greater .",
    "recent measurements of h@xmath18 emission in this part of the sky imply the free - free contribution to the msam1 signal at 5.7  is @xmath92500  jy / sr rms ( @xcite ) , several orders of magnitude smaller than the signal we report .",
    "we consider the possibility that these detections correspond to compact radio ( or infrared ) point sources .",
    "note that the power law models corresponding to free - free and synchrotron also can be interpreted as flat - spectrum or steep - spectrum radio spectra , respectively , typical of extragalactic radio sources .",
    "no counterparts for the features were found within one beamwidth of the feature locations in the 5  ghz s5 polar cap survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "for all three features , the best - fit flat spectra predict 5  ghz fluxes greater than 3  jy , while the best - fit steep spectra predict fluxes greater than 40 jy .",
    "the s5 survey is estimated to be complete at 5  ghz down to 250 mjy , providing a strong limit on any flat- or steep - spectrum radio counterpart to the detections .",
    "a similar search was performed with the  100  faint source catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 5 objects ranging in flux from 0.92.6  jy were found within one beamwidth of any one of the three features , consistent with the average  fsc source density of @xmath93sq .",
    "the contribution of these sources to the msam signal is shown to be negligible using the 1.25  mm to 100  flux ratio , @xmath94 , determined from a complete sample of   galaxies , together with a relatively flat @xmath95 spectrum locally around 1.25  mm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the greatest contribution is at 16.5  , where it is estimated to be @xmath96  jy for each of the latter two features , and @xmath97  mjy for the 15  feature .",
    "the contributions at 9.3  are a factor of 5 smaller than these , while at 5.7  they are a factor of 30 smaller .",
    "these estimates are reinforced with direct observations at 90  ghz of known iras sources in the vicinity of the 15  feature , none of which show significant flux density above the rms noise of 2550  mjy ( @xcite ) .      in 1994",
    ", we flew the msam instrument a second time to observe the same field as the 1992 flight .",
    "while the sky overlap between msam1 - 94 and msam1 - 92 was not perfect , it was sufficient to permit an overall comparison of the measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have repeated the fits of  [ sec : fits ] on the msam1 - 94 data to see if the bright features are present .",
    "near 15 , there is a corresponding hot spot at @xmath98 with @xmath99 , @xmath100  kjy / sr , and @xmath101  kjy / sr ( statistical errors only ) . near 193 and 199",
    ", there are corresponding features that are fit simultaneously as before . at 5.7  ,",

    "the fit gives @xmath106 , @xmath107  jy , and @xmath104 , @xmath108  jy . the correlations in the msam1 - 94 fits are larger than the msam1 - 92 fits ; in particular , the 193 and 199 flux densities have variance correlations of @xmath109 at 5.7  , and @xmath110 at 9.3  .",
    "the somewhat smaller flux densities in msam1 - 94 are consistent with the pointing differences between the two flights .",
    "since the initial report of these detections in paper  i , a number of groups have searched one or more of these regions for corresponding sources at different wavelengths and/or resolutions .",
    "of particular note is the search reported by @xcite using the caltech submillimeter observatory on mauna kea .",
    "this search , which made a deep map of the sky around the 15  feature at 4.7  using a 17 beam , places an upper limit on any point source in that field of @xmath111  jy .",
    "another observation of this field has recently been reported by @xcite .",
    "these observations were made from the ground at saskatoon , saskatchewan , canada , in q - band ( 3646 ghz , 1.21.5 ) at 05 resolution , a portion of which were designed to reproduce , as closely as possible , the msam observations .",
    "a three - lobe beammap , similar to the msam double - difference demodulation , was synthesized ( the single - difference demodulation is not usable from the ground due to atmospheric noise ) .",
    "although having somewhat less statistical weight than the msam observations , the saskatoon results correlate well with msam , including the bright feature near 15  right ascension .",
    "the presence of bright , compact features in the msam1 - 92 data was unexpected . in paper",
    "i , we questioned whether cmbr fluctuations obeying gaussian statistics could produce such features . to address this issue ,",
    "we have performed a detailed monte carlo simulation of the msam observations .",
    "the approach used is similar to that outlined in  4.3 of paper  i. ] .",
    "we generate numerical realizations of the observations , including contributions from instrument noise and cmbr temperature anisotropies , assuming the anisotropy is a gaussian random field described by a two - point correlation function , @xmath112 . in paper",
    "i , we set limits on the overall amplitude of @xmath113 by using the likelihood ratio statistic @xmath114 ; here , we use those upper and lower bounds to generate realizations which are then searched according to the procedure of  [ sec : search ] for unresolved features . unlike paper",
    "i , here we simulate both demodulations simultaneously , using @xmath115 .",
    "we thus determine the distribution of @xmath116 , the number of unresolved features with @xmath117 , corresponding to the range of @xmath118 fluctuations found in the data .",
    "our measured number of sources is @xmath119 or 3 , depending on the assignment of the 199 feature to cmbr or galactic dust . for @xmath120 ,",
    "we find the cumulative probability @xmath121 , @xmath122 , while for @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 . from this",
    ", we conclude that bright , compact features such as those observed are in fact consistent with our assumption of gaussian statistics .",
    "we have also studied the distribution of @xmath116 using a more physically motivated correlation function , calculated for `` standard '' flat cold dark matter ( cdm ) with @xmath126 , and no reionization ( @xcite ) . using this model , normalized to the /dmr detection @xmath127k ( @xcite )",
    ", we find reasonable probabilities for the observed @xmath116 : @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
    "thus , the detections are consistent with adiabatic fluctuation models such as cdm .",
    "similar results have also been reported for a more generic study of 05 resolution cmbr maps ( @xcite ) .",
    "all three features are best described as temperature anisotropies in the cmbr , although the possibility remains that one of these is due to galactic foreground dust emission . while we were initially surprised to find such bright , compact features in the data , we now understand that these are consistent with our assumption of gaussian fluctuations .",
    "although our catalog searches were all null , we find the most compelling argument that the features are not true point - sources comes from the direct search by @xcite .",
    "finally , the morphological agreement reported by the saskatoon experiment , consistent with a cmbr anisotropy spectrum spanning three octaves in frequency from q - band ( 1.2 ) to the msam 9.3  band , leaves little room for alternate explanations of the detection .",
    "given the agreement with a cmbr temperature anisotropy spectrum , together with the implausability of other explanations , we conclude that at least the first two , and possibly all three of these detections , are cosmological in origin .",
    "we would like to thank the staff of the national scientific balloon facility ( nsbf ) for their outstanding support during the two flight campaigns .",
    "we would also like to thank e. magnier , r. rutledge , c. bennett , r. bond , j. silk , and c. lawrence for many helpful discussions of these features over the years .",
