    "singular interaction potentials were introduced in quantum mechanics more than sixty years ago @xcite . since then they found applications in various areas of solid state @xcite , particle @xcite and nuclear @xcite physics .",
    "it has also been known for a long time that local nature of these potentials at all scales leads to appearance ultraviolet divergencies in quantum mechanics similar to those encountered in quantum field theory . however , unlike quantum field theory in which one meets uv divergensies primarilly due to the presence of infinite number of degrees of freedom , in quantum mechanics the infinities occur due to the singular nature of the potentials chosen .",
    "mathematical theory of how to treat such potentials is well known @xcite , @xcite and is based on construction of self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonians in question .    on the other hand",
    "there has been a lot of recent interest in noncommutative spaces @xcite , @xcite , @xcite motivated primarilly by string @xcite and field theory @xcite applications .",
    "in particular , on the field theory side it is believed that in certain cases noncommutative modification of the algebraic structure of space - time can provide a natural regularization of uv divergencies .",
    "this is certainly the case for compact manifolds  @xcite , @xcite since field theories on the noncommutative generalizations of such manifolds posess only finite number of degrees of freedom thus removing the intrinsic reason for appearance of uv divergencies .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the quantum mechanics on the flat noncommutative two dimensional space @xcite in the presence of singular potentials and to show that nonlocality of interaction induced by fuzziness of space leads to a well - defined quantum theory . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we consider nonrelativistic spin zero particles in a @xmath0-function potential and after a brief discussion of the main results known from the commutative case @xcite , @xcite we give a complete analytic solution of the corresponding schrdinger equation over the noncommutative plane .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] deals with spin-@xmath1 relativistic particles in the aharonov - bohm background magnetic field and we use fock space formalism to obtain the complete set of eigenfunctions for this problem . also the relationship between commutative and noncommutative solutions is discussed and we show that in the limit of vanishing noncommutativity parameter @xmath2 we recover the same solutions as those given by theory of self - adjoint extensions .    our notations and conventions as well as a review of star - product and fock space formalisms in noncommutative geometry are given in appendix .",
    "in the commutative case the schrdinger equation for spin zero particle moving in a two - dimensional @xmath0-function potential , can be written as ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 or , in terms of new coupling constant @xmath5 and energy parameter @xmath6 , @xmath7 both the @xmath0-function potential in two dimensions and the kinetic energy operator scale in polar coordinates @xmath8 as @xmath9 , therefore the coupling @xmath10 is dimensionless . as a consequence ,",
    "the hamiltonian is scale invariant and we can anticipate the presence of logarithmic ultraviolet divergencies , analogous to those appearing in qed and qcd .",
    "the standard way of obtaining an exact solution of ( [ commequation ] ) analytically is to use method of self - adjoint extensions .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the two - dimensional laplace operator @xmath11 is not self - adjoint on a punctured plane and construction of self - adjoint extension requires relaxing the condition of regularity of wave functions at the origin and allowing @xmath12 singularity at @xmath13 .",
    "however , @xmath14 is then not well - defined .",
    "thus , we need to define @xmath15 for wavefunctions behaving near the origin as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an arbitrary dimensional parameter .",
    "formal integration of eq.([commequation ] ) over a small disk of radius @xmath18 followed by taking the limit @xmath19 gives the correct constraint on coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22 which we should take as a boundary condition on a wavefunction .",
    "more detailed derivation of ( [ boundarycond ] ) can be found in @xcite .    with these ideas in mind we can rewrite ( [ commequation ] ) for an axially symmetric wavefunction as @xmath23 which for @xmath24 admits @xmath25 as a solution .",
    "here @xmath26 is the modified bessel function of the third kind @xcite . from the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath27 near the origin , namely , @xmath28 and the boundary condition ( [ boundarycond ] ) we find an expression for the energy of this bound state @xmath29",
    "therefore this theory provides us with an example of a spontaneous breakedown of scale invariance where bound state energy is set by an arbitrary dimensionful parameter @xmath17 .      in complete analogy with commutative case",
    "we can write the schrdinger equation for a particle moving in a noncommutative @xmath0-function potential as @xmath30 but where @xmath31 now is an operator valued wavefunction @xmath32 and @xmath33 is defined in ( [ nelta ] ) .    in momentum space equation ( [ nmain ] )",
    "becomes @xmath34 with parameters @xmath6 and @xmath5 defined as in commutative case .",
    "equation ( [ main ] ) is an integral equation for momentum space wave - function which , in general , is difficult to solve .",
    "but the solution of this particular equation is greatly simplified if one observes that the differential operator @xmath35 when applied to the r.h.s of ( [ main ] ) gives zero , and , therefore , we are left only with @xmath36   ( |p|^2 -\\et)\\phi(p , \\bar p ) = 0 \\label{simpleq}\\ ] ] this last equation is easy to solve and , after we pass to the eigenstates @xmath37 of angular momentum operator @xmath38 its solutions are given by @xmath39 for @xmath24 , while for positive energies eq.([simpleq ] ) admits an extra @xmath0-function term and therefore we write @xmath40 by direct substitution , it can be verified that eq.([possol ] ) gives a complete set of scattering states provided that constants @xmath41 are choosen as the solutions of @xmath42 for @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for @xmath45 , with functions @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 and where @xmath48 is the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "similar analysis shows that eqs.[sol ] also satisfy schrdinger equation for @xmath43 only , thus giving us bound state solutions the number of which , as well as their energies being given by the following set of eigenvalue equations @xmath49    ) . in this case we have two bound states.,width=313 ]    example of a graphical solution of these equations is presented in fig.1 , from which it can also be seen , that like in commutative case , the radially symmetric solution ( @xmath50 ) exists for arbitrary strength of attractive potential but , unlike the commutative case , for sufficiently strong potentials ( when dimensionless coupling @xmath51 ) this problem also admits bound states with nonzero angular momentum ( @xmath52 ) , the number of such solutions being a function of @xmath10 only .",
    "it is also instructive to look at limiting cases of very strong and very weak binding potential more closely .      in this case",
    "@xmath54 and we can use asymptotic expansion @xmath55 and write ( [ sol ] ) as @xmath56 with solutions @xmath57 or @xmath58 and we see that bound state spectrum in this case coincides with that of a simple harmonic ocsillator of frequency @xmath59 @xcite .      in this case",
    "only one solution of ( [ bound ] ) exists corresponding to @xmath50 and @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we can use the asymptotic form of @xmath62 for small @xmath63 s which is @xmath64 this gives the following eigenvalue equation @xmath65 with binding energy @xmath66 comparing this last expression with ( [ eigenval ] ) we see that this limit corresponds to the commutative case with @xmath67 playing the rle of parameter @xmath68 in commutative case .",
    "in this section we briefly review the solutions of a massive dirac equation in the aharonov - bohm background field of an infinitely thin magnetic vortex carrying magnetic flux @xmath69 .",
    "this presentation closely follows ref.@xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic potential describing such field configuration can be chosen in polar coordinates @xmath8 as @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 has a well known property of being locally a pure gauge .",
    "the dirac equation for this problem is @xmath72 and allows passing to the eigenstates of angular momentum @xmath73 . by defining @xmath74",
    "the radial eigenvalue problem is @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "for @xmath77 it has the solutions @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a normalization factor , @xmath80 , @xmath81 denotes the bessel functions and @xmath82 is taken to be either@xmath83 or @xmath84 to assure regularity of spinor components at the origin .",
    "this choice of the sign for @xmath82 can always be done except for the partial wave with @xmath85 in which case both choices of sign lead to solutions that are square integrable , though singular in one component , at the origin . to avoid a loss of completeness in angular basis , a family of self - adjoint extensions of dirac hamiltonian is required .",
    "these extensions are parametrized by a single parameter @xmath86 ( not to be confused with noncommutativity parameter @xmath2 ) and restrict the behaviour of the wavefunction at @xmath87 to be @xmath88    with the boundary condition established , the energy eigenstates are    @xmath89 \\\\ i\\sqrt{e - m}\\ [ \\sin\\mu j_{\\nu+1}(k\\rho ) + ( -1)^{n+1 } \\cos\\mu j_{-(\\nu+1)}(k\\rho ) ] \\\\ \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ]    with @xmath17 related to @xmath90 by the equation @xmath91 in addition , for @xmath92 there is a bound state @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are modified bessel functions .",
    "the bound - state energy is implicitly determined from @xmath96      on the noncommutative plane it is convenient to use complex notation for the vector potential @xmath97 so that magnetic field strength can be written as @xmath98 .\\ ] ] for a magnetic vortex field @xmath99 an explicit expression for vector potential can be written if we use the following ansatz @xmath100 with a radially symmetric function @xmath101 this form is valid for @xmath102 only .",
    "the dirac equation for this problem formally coincides with eq.([dirac ] ) in commutative case @xmath103 if we require that gauge connection acts from the left on operator - valued spinor wave function @xmath104 . by defining @xmath105",
    "we get the following eigenvalue problem @xmath106 which leads to the second order equations for each of the two components of the dirac spinor @xmath107 it should be noted here that due to the noncommutativity of covariant derivatives @xmath108 = ief_{z\\bar z}\\ ] ] the equation for @xmath109 component contains an extra term @xmath110 as compared to the equation satisfied by @xmath111 . in a commutative limit",
    "this term is proportional to @xmath112 and is equal to zero as long as @xmath109 is regular at the origin .",
    "to solve ( [ eq1 ] , [ eq2 ] ) we use the following ansatz of angular momentum @xmath113 @xmath114 for @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath117 .    for negative @xmath118 s",
    "this gives us recursion relations on coefficients @xmath119 @xmath120 where again we used @xmath121 .",
    "these recursion relations are quite easy to solve with the solutions given by ( up to a normalization factor )    [ solution1 ] @xmath122    with @xmath123 the pochhammer symbol and @xmath124 the generalized laguerre polynomial .",
    "for @xmath125 recursion relations are the same as ( [ recursion ] ) but `` boundary '' conditions ( [ boundary ] ) are different ( note that in this case the series expansion in ( [ positive ] ) begins with @xmath126 and @xmath127 terms for the first and second spinor components respectively ) @xmath128 these equations are also easy to solve    @xmath129    where coefficient @xmath130 is a solution of the linear equation    @xmath131    and ensures that conditions ( [ bound1 ] , [ bound2 ] ) are obeyed .",
    "it is an easy task now to check that eqs.([solution1 ] ) , ( [ solution2 ] ) do also satisfy the first order dirac equations ( [ firstorder ] ) and , therefore , give a complete set of angular momentum eigenstates for our problem .",
    "in this paper we have studied noncommutative generalizations of quantum mechanics in the presence of @xmath0  -  function potentials .",
    "it was found that noncommutativity of space - time can be used to provide an intrinsic regularization of the theories in question . using the star product formalism we found analytically all the solutions of that problem",
    ". the folowing remarks , however , are in order :    1 .   the apparent asymmetry between holomorphic and antiholomorphic solutions in , for example ( [ possol ] ) , can be understood if one notes that action of noncommutative @xmath0-function operator on antiholomorphic wavefunctions is trivial @xmath132 and , therefore , in our model these modes are free , i.e. they are described by schrdinger equation ( [ nmain ] ) with kinetic term only .",
    "however , the highly nontrivial action of the same operator on holomorphic wavefunctions gives rise to a finite number of extra bound states with nonzero angular momentum .",
    "these states do not have any commutative analogues and disappear from our theory in the limit of vanishing @xmath2 as well , while in the limit of strong noncommutativity the spectrum of these states coinsides with the spectrum of a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath59 .",
    "2 .   for dirac particles we can use the correspondence between fock space operators and ordinary functions @xmath133 to show that commutative limit of our solutions ( [ solution1]),([solution2 ] ) for critical value of @xmath134 is @xmath135 which after camparison with eq.([extensions ] ) tells us that commutative limit of our model corresponds to @xmath136 which probably explains the absence of bound states in our model , since in commutative limit bound states exist only if @xmath92 .",
    "3 .   the simple ansatz used to find vector potential is valid only if condition @xmath102 is satisfied .",
    "it is not clear at present if it is possible to extend our approach to @xmath137 region .      throughout this paper",
    "we work in @xmath138 dimensional flat noncommutative space with usual commutation relations : @xmath139 = i\\theta . \\label{commut}\\ ] ] it is convenient to introduce complex variables @xmath140 and @xmath141 @xmath142 so that ( [ commut ] ) becomes @xmath143 = 2\\theta\\ ] ] and @xmath144 can be thought of as a pair of creation - annihilation operators acting in the space of fock states @xmath145 as      algebra of functions on the noncommutative plane is then equivalent to the algebra of linear operators in fock space .",
    "derivatives on noncommutative plane are the inner derivations @xmath147 , \\ \\ \\",
    "\\partial_{\\bar z } = \\frac{1}{2\\theta}[z , \\ldots]\\ ] ] while integration is the same as trace of operator @xmath148    the elements of the algebra of functions on noncommutative space can also be identified with ordinary functions on @xmath149 through the weyl - moyal correspondence @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the usual fourier transform of @xmath152 .",
    "the product of two functions @xmath153 and @xmath154 which corresponds to the product of operators @xmath155 is given by the moyal ( or star product ) formula @xmath156 f(x^1)g(x^2)|_{x^1=x^2=x}\\ ] ] we also need a generalization of the concept of a @xmath0  -  function to noncommutative space . in usual field theory @xmath0  -  functions are used to describe localized sources .",
    "but because in noncommutative case the space is smeared at small distances we can not construct a truly localized source . direct application of transform ( [ weyl ] ) to @xmath157 gives an operator which is spread out over all of space . therefore , the most localized source we can construct in the noncommutative case is a gaussian wave packet @xcite @xmath158 whose transform is @xmath159 meaning that noncommutative @xmath0-function is in fact a projection operator onto the fock space groundstate @xmath160 .",
    "we also note that @xmath161 and in @xmath162 limit we recover the ussual @xmath0-function .",
