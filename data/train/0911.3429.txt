    "the magnetic moments of the baryons are of the utmost importance since they contain information on their internal structure as read out by electromagnetic probes .",
    "a starting point is the su(3)@xmath3-symmetric model of coleman and glashow ( cg )  @xcite that describes baryon - octet magnetic moments in terms of two parameters .",
    "the success of this model relies on the almost preserved global su(3)@xmath4-symmetry of qcd with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 flavors .",
    "the description of the symmetry - breaking corrections of the baryon magnetic moments can be addressed in a systematic and model - independent fashion by means of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath8pt )  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the cg result appears naturally at leading - order ( lo ) as tree - level . at next - to - leading ( nlo ) order",
    ", there are only loop - contributions that depend on known couplings and masses and , therefore , no new undetermined low - energy constants ( lecs ) besides those appearing in the cg approach are to be included .",
    "the question is then if the su(3)@xmath3-breaking corrections to the baryon - octet magnetic moments can be successfully addressed from a first principles approach by means of @xmath8pt ; namely whether or not the chiral loops improve the classical cg results .",
    "a positive answer to this question has been given only recently  @xcite when applying the extended - on - mass - shell ( eoms ) renormalization scheme  @xcite which is an extension of @xmath9 developed to overcome the power - counting problem in the baryon sector of @xmath8pt .",
    "for a detailed presentation of our results and their comparison with heavy baryon ( hb )  @xcite or infrared ( ir )  @xcite formulations of baryon @xmath8pt , see refs .",
    "the comparison of our results with those obtained before stresses the importance in su(3)@xmath3-@xmath8pt of the relativistic corrections , in the case of hb , and of keeping unaltered the analytic properties of the theory , in the case of ir . concerning the inclusion of the decuplet resonances ,",
    "@xmath10 contributions that do not spoil the improvement over cg were found only in the eoms framework and when the unphysical degrees of freedom contained in the relativistic spin-3/2 vector - spinor were removed by means of the @xmath11 couplings  @xcite .",
    "it is also noteworthy that we obtain a good convergence since the nlo contribution is , at most , about one half of the lo one , what is consistent with our @xmath12 maximal expectation of @xmath13 .    the aforementioned covariant approach that includes",
    "both octet and decuplet contributions has also been applied to the description of the electromagnetic structure of the decuplet resonances  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the magnetic dipole moments of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 are predicted using the well - measured one of the @xmath16 to fix the only lec appearing up to nlo @xmath17 where the error bars are an estimation of higher - order contributions obtained looking at the ratio between nlo and lo contributions ( we take @xmath18 of the nlo over lo ratio )  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of these results lies on the ongoing efforts from the experimental side to measure the magnetic moments of these two resonances  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "calculations from many different approaches have arisen in the last decades  @xcite .",
    "our results are compatible with the values quoted by the particle data group  @xcite and the agreement with the latest experimental analysis , @xmath19  @xcite , is excellent .",
    "the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite plays a very important role in our study and understanding of flavor physics . in particular",
    ", its low mass sector allows for a precise test of the standard model through the ckm unitarity relation , @xmath20 where one needs accurate values for @xmath21 , @xmath2 , and @xmath22 . among them",
    ", @xmath22 is quite small and can be neglected at the present precision .",
    "the element @xmath21 can be obtained from superallowed nuclear beta , neutron and pion decays , whereas @xmath2 can be extracted from kaon , hyperon , and tau decays ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "we now focus on how to determine @xmath2 from hyperon semileptonic decay data .",
    "the hyperon matrix elements of the weak flavor - changing currents are described by three vector ( axial ) form factors @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) with @xmath25 .",
    "the decay ratio of the semileptonic decay @xmath26 will then be determined by these form factors , the fermi constant @xmath27 , and the ckm element @xmath2 . indeed ,",
    "if we define as a relevant su(3)-breaking parameter @xmath28 , we can perform a power expansion of the decay rate about the su(3)-symmetric limit @xmath29 where the form factors are evaluated at @xmath30 , although a linear @xmath31 dependence in @xmath32 and @xmath33 must also be considered at this order  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the su(3)-symmetric limit for @xmath34 can be used .",
    "the most relevant contributions to the ratio come then from @xmath33 , @xmath32 and also @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , in order to extract accurately @xmath2 from semileptonic hyperon decay data , one requires to understand , in a model - independent fashion , the su(3)-breaking contributions to these moments .",
    "the @xmath35 vanishes in the su(3)-symmetric limit , and we will assume @xmath36 . the axial charge @xmath33 , which is described in the symmetric limit by the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 , receives @xmath39 breaking corrections . nevertheless , as it has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can use the measured @xmath40 ratios as the basic experimental data to equate @xmath33 in terms of @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rat3 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath32 is protected by the ademollo - gatto theorem  @xcite which states that breaking corrections start at @xmath41 .",
    ".results on the relative su(3)-breaking of @xmath1 in @xmath42 for different channels obtained in @xmath8pt up to nnlo including octet and decuplet contributions and those obtained in other approaches.[table ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the ademollo - gatto theorem is a consequence of the underlying su(3)@xmath4 symmetry of qcd , which has also important consequences when addressing a calculation of @xmath1 in @xmath8pt .",
    "namely , one finds that no unknown lecs contributing to this vector charge are allowed until chiral order @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , a loop calculation up to and including nnlo only depends on known masses and couplings and is a genuine prediction of @xmath8pt .",
    "moreover , there are not divergencies or power counting breaking terms up to this order so that a counting restoration procedure does not seem necessary in this case",
    ". this program has been developed in different steps along the last two decades  @xcite . a full nnlo calculation including",
    "both octet and decuplet contributions in the covariant framework has been undertaken recently  @xcite . in the latter work the problem with the convergence found in the hb calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite has also been explained and fixed .    in table",
    "[ table ] we present the results for the relative su(3)-breaking correction @xmath44 in covariant @xmath8pt ( b@xmath8pt ) and hb@xmath8pt including octet and decuplet contributions up to nnlo .",
    "we also present those obtained in large @xmath45  @xcite , in a quark model ( qm )  @xcite , in a chiral quark model ( @xmath8qm )  @xcite and in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "the error bars in the b@xmath8pt are an estimation of higher order uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "the results quoted from ref .",
    "@xcite are quite general in quark model calculations and reflect the naive expectation that su(3)-breaking corrections , at least for the @xmath46 channel , should be negative . on the other hand ,",
    "the different chiral approaches agree in the positive sign and the approximate size of these corrections , what may indicate the non - triviality of the multiquark effects induced by the chiral dynamics .",
    "it is also remarkable the agreement with those obtained in a different systematic approach to non - perturbative qcd as the large @xmath45 .",
    "the results of lattice qcd are marginally compatible with ours although they favor negative corrections to @xmath1 .",
    "however , it must be pointed out that the pion masses in these simulations are still rather high , namely @xmath47400 mev for @xmath48  @xcite and @xmath47700 mev for @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "another issue to be highlighted is the chiral extrapolation of the lattice qcd results to the physical point , for which our results might be helpful in the future . and the other way around",
    ", the lattice qcd could provide information about the higher - order local contributions in the chiral approach and could reduce the theoretical uncertainty of the b@xmath8pt calculation  @xcite . in any case , a lattice simulation close to the physical point will be very helpful and eventually conclusive about the nature of the su(3)-breaking corrections to @xmath1 .    with the elements developed above we obtain a determination of the ckm element @xmath2 that @xmath50 the information on the different channels and includes the experimental errors  @xcite and higher - order errors estimated for @xmath1 in b@xmath8pt  @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 accounts for other systematic uncertainties .",
    "at the order we work in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rat3 ] ) , this uncertainty is due to the su(3)-breaking correction to @xmath35 that has not been considered .",
    "this contribution is @xmath53 and potentially as important for the extraction of @xmath2 as the su(3)-breaking correction to @xmath32 .",
    "we first compare our result with other determinations obtained from the decay rates and @xmath40 in the hyperon semileptonic data ; namely , @xmath54 in large @xmath45  @xcite and @xmath55 in the su(3)-symmetric model  @xcite .",
    "the comparison with the latter indicates the sensitivity to a breaking correction to @xmath1 of @xmath53 and suggests that the su(3)-symmetric assumption is not reliable enough for the accuracy required by the determination of @xmath2 .",
    "the agreement between the b@xmath8pt and the large @xmath45 is a consequence of the consistency shown in table  [ table ] and of the fact that in both approaches the su(3)-breaking correction to @xmath35 have been ignored .    on the other hand ,",
    "our result is somewhat smaller than the ones obtained from kaon and tau decays or from the @xmath56 ratio  @xcite .",
    "it is not compatible either with the unitarity condition eq .",
    "( [ unitarity ] ) when using the value obtained from superallowed beta decays  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the result shown in eq .",
    "(  [ vus ] ) is not complete and has to be improved with the model - independent description of the su(3)-breaking corrections to @xmath35 . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the trends shown by @xmath57 and @xmath58 data indicate that the incorporation of the su(3)-breaking corrections to @xmath35 will raise the value of @xmath2 in these two channels .",
    "unfortunately , the data for hyperon decays is not yet precise enough to address a quantitative study of this form factor . from the theoretical side",
    ", a determination of these corrections in lattice qcd and an analysis in b@xmath8pt would be useful to ascertain the effects that @xmath35 may have on the determination of @xmath2 .",
