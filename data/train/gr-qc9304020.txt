    "schutz ( 1986 ) and krolak and schutz ( 1987 ) noted that observation of binary inspiral in three independent interferometers will reveal the source s luminosity distance @xmath11 . with an _ independent _ measure of the source redshift",

    "interferometer and without any other independent knowledge about individual binary systems .",
    "extensions systematically exploit additional information available from multiple interferometers .    to assess the capabilities of these tests we consider observations in a single ; thus , our work applies directly to the individual interferometers in the  and virgo projects .",
    "in addition , the two components making up the  will be arranged in nearly the same plane and with nearly identical arm orientations ( whitcomb 1992 )  a configuration which operates like a single  of increased sensitivity ( finn and chernoff 1993 , fc ) .",
    "we apply our recent results ( fc ) for the precision with which a binary s parameters can be determined in a single .",
    "below we describe the physical basis and methodology of our tests . as a concrete application",
    "we specialize to neutron star binary systems of constant mass .",
    "we find the effective volumes sampled and the cosmological source rates .",
    "we derive the precision with which @xmath1 and @xmath8 may be determined in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .",
    "we demonstrate that source evolution may be handled in a straightforward manner .",
    "assume that quadrupole - formula gravitational radiation adiabatically damps a binary s newtonian orbit .",
    "let the distance between the source and the  be @xmath12 .",
    "the time - dependent response to the gravity - wave is ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 where the `` chirp '' mass @xmath15 and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the reduced and total mass of the binary system .",
    "the frequency @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the instant the binary separation @xmath20 given the above approximations and @xmath21 is a constant phase .",
    "@xmath22 is a known function of four angles specifying the orientation of the binary system with respect to the ( @xmath23 , fc ) : @xmath24 lies along the binary s orbital angular momentum and @xmath25 points from the detector to the binary .",
    "the wave frequency @xmath26 is twice the binary s orbital frequency , and a will be sensitive to the radiation during the last few minutes of inspiral as @xmath26 sweeps from @xmath27  hz to @xmath28  khz . for binaries at cosmological distances",
    "the form of the response is the same , only now in place of @xmath12 we have the _ luminosity distance _ @xmath11 and in place of @xmath29 we have @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the redshift . for more detail ,",

    "schutz ( 1986 ) showed that three interferometers of different orientations are capable of determining @xmath11 , @xmath32 , @xmath21 , @xmath19 , @xmath25 , and @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , a single  can measure only @xmath33 , @xmath32 , @xmath19 , and @xmath21 ( fc ) ; thus , @xmath11 can not be determined directly since @xmath25 and @xmath24 are unknown . however ,",
    "we know that @xmath25 and @xmath24 are each uniformly distributed on the sphere ; consequently , the distribution of @xmath34 is also known .",
    "thus , the observed distribution of @xmath35 is related to the number density of binary systems on spheres of constant @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the observed distribution of @xmath32 is connected to the number density on shells of constant @xmath31 . with a physically plausible assumption regarding the evolution of the source distribution function with @xmath31 , the joint distribution of observed inspiral events as",
    "a function of @xmath32 and @xmath35 is sufficient to measure @xmath1 , @xmath8 , and otherwise test cosmological models .",
    "let @xmath36 be the _ intrinsic _ binary coalescence rate ( events per time ) , where @xmath29 is the intrinsic chirp mass and @xmath37 is the local volume element . the snr @xmath38 is a function of the parameters that describe the binary system and its orientation with respect to the detector .",

    "the factor @xmath62 expresses the time - dependence of the intrinsic rate and @xmath63 encompasses all evolutionary effects for a _ comoving _ volume @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "the factorization of @xmath39 implies that the chirp mass distribution is independent of the age of the universe , although the coalescence rate may vary .",
    "this assumption is justified if the character of the binary formation process ( suitably averaged over many galaxies ) is independent of @xmath31 .",
    "the assumption is _ very _ plausible for neutron star binaries .",
    "neutron stars form in the collapse of degenerate stellar cores in type ii supernovae or by accretion induced collapse of white dwarfs . in either case",
    "the mechanism that triggers the collapse and determines the mass depends largely on the equation of state of degenerate matter .",

    "current understanding suggests that the hole s upper mass is not tightly constrained by microscopic physical processes and , in fact , observations show a range of candidate masses ( casares , charles and naylor 1992 ; remillard , mcclintock and bailyn 1992 ) .",
    "the assumption that source evolution is a function of @xmath31 _ alone _ is a phenomenological , not a physical , treatment .",
    "in contrast , a physical approach would introduce additional , non - cosmological timescales .",

    "now assume that neutron star binaries are the predominant sources . noting that the measured range of pulsar masses is small ( @xmath66 ; lamb 1991 ) , while the derived range of masses in binary x - ray pulsars is somewhat larger ( @xmath67 ; nagase 1989 ) , take @xmath68 , _",

    "the detection rate @xmath44 scales directly with the local coalescence rate .",
    "phinney ( 1991 ) has discussed the observational and theoretical limits .",
    "based on the several observed neutron star binaries , the time until coalescence , and the effective galactic volumes sampled , he gives a `` best guess '' estimate for the coalescence rate density of @xmath109 mpc@xmath110 yr@xmath111 .",
    "this is a _ conservative _ estimate because it counts only binaries like those observed to date ; for a number of reasons the true value may exceed the estimate by as much as @xmath112 [ @xmath113(@xmath114 km / s / mpc)]@xmath115 .",
    "scaling to the conservative value , the anticipated detection rate is @xmath116 recall that the function @xmath117 is the ratio of the cosmological rate to the euclidean rate ; figure 1b gives @xmath117 for a range of @xmath96 for values of @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 assuming no source evolution .",

    "the effects of source evolution may dominate the influence of @xmath8 on the value of @xmath117 .",
    "our main interest here is to assess our cosmology test when source evolution takes place ; consequently we adopt an _ ad hoc _ model @xmath124 $ ] for @xmath125 and @xmath126 otherwise .",
    "this model is useful for both strong and weak evolution .",
    "( 1988 ) consider a similar form for galaxy luminosity evolution ; however , we make no attempt to apply their results . in adopting this model",
    ", we envision three qualitatively different possibilities : ( 1 ) the coalescence rate may be simply proportional to the star formation rate . then , based on the faint galaxy studies , there should be little evolution for @xmath127 ( kk ) .",

    "( 2 ) neutron star binaries may be formed by collisional encounters in the dense cores of galaxies .",
    "the luminosity evolution of qsos is a strong function of @xmath31 ( boyle _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 , 1988 ) ; hence , if the coalescence rate is proportional to the qso luminosity , a substantial increase in the production rate with @xmath31 is expected .",
    "we take @xmath129 and @xmath130 [ for which @xmath63 peaks at @xmath131 , where it is @xmath132 for this case of _ early production_. ( 3 ) binaries may be formed by collisional encounters in globular clusters after core collapse .",
    "the time to core collapse is of order @xmath133 for clusters in the galaxy . for the case of",
    "_ late production _ ,",
    "we take @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which cuts off strongly for @xmath136 .",
    "figure 1b illustrates how early and late production alters @xmath117 in the @xmath122 model .",
    "we used a monte carlo analysis to calculate the precision with which @xmath137 can be determined .",
    "we chose `` true '' model parameters @xmath138 and formed a realization of n observations .",

    ", we found the bias @xmath144 and the rms dispersion @xmath145 . in all cases we found the magnitude of the bias to be much less than the dispersion ; so , we deal with the latter as an indication of the best performance that can be expected for measurement of @xmath40 .",

    "the dispersions reported in table 1 should only be taken as rough approximations : we have not attempted to determine the precision to which they are found by our monte carlo analysis .",
    "it is clear , however , that our samples ( for fixed @xmath96 ) extend into the asymptotic regime , where the dispersion is @xmath162 .",
    "note how , at fixed @xmath142 , the hubble constant is not better determined by the deeper sample ( smaller threshold @xmath0 , which implies smaller @xmath96 ) : thus , sample size is more important than sample depth to the accurate determination of @xmath161 . in contrast , the uncertainties in @xmath8 are significantly smaller in the deeper sample .",

    "observations of the gravitational radiation from binary inspiral by the ligo detector can be used to measure important cosmological parameters .",
    "these measurements rely on comparing the observed distribution of inspiral events , as a function of signal strength and chirp mass , with model predictions .",

    "we give the rate of detections as a function of the detector threshold signal - to - noise ratio using phinney s ( 1991 ) conservative estimate of the local binary coalescence rate .",
    "we find that , with a modest number of detections , these observations can determine the hubble constant to 10% .",
    "the conservative rate estimate implies that the observations would take @xmath167 years .",
