    "an electronic nose is a device intended to detect and recognize different odors or flavor types . over the last decade , electronic sensing",
    "also known as e - sensing technologies have undergone important developments from a technical and commercial point of view @xcite .",
    "e - sensing refers to the capability of reproducing human senses using sensor arrays , pattern recognition and machine learning techniques . in international space stations for instance ,",
    "e - noses are designed to help reducing the risks associated with crewmember exposure to toxic or dangerous chemicals .",
    "conformity of raw materials and final products , detection of contamination , spoilage , adulteration and monitoring of storage conditions widely use e - nose technology at line quality control .",
    "identification of volatile organic compounds in air , water and soil samples for environmental protection and monitoring purposes represent only a few of the application areas where odor / flavor recognition plays a key role .    from machine learning",
    "prospective , any gas / odor signal produced by a sensor can be considered as a sequence of pairs _",
    "( timestamp , value ) _ and these data values are ordered in timestamp ascending order .",
    "similarly , the odor recognition task in e - sensing can be viewed as a time series classification problem in pattern recognition .",
    "overviewing the gas signal processing literature , there are three major types of approaches to deal with the odor classification task @xcite .",
    "the first category is feature - based classification , which transforms a signal sequence into a feature vector and then applies conventional classifiers .",
    "feature selection plays an important role in this kind of methods .",
    "the second category is sequence distance - based classification .",
    "the distance function which measures the similarity between sequences affects the recognition rate significantly .",
    "the third category is model - based approaches such as hidden markov models ( hmm ) and other statistical models .",
    "it is worth noting that the traditional methods for odor identification ( and time series classification , in general ) are mostly _ whole - sequence based _",
    "i.e. they make an a - priori assumption that all the elements of a time series signal to be classified are observed in advance .    with the increasing availability of temporal data at a large scale , there is a growing demand for early classification of an ongoing sequence as early as possible , preferably after only few of its preceding elements occurred . for example",
    ", many air quality problems caused by toxic chemical leaks or spills have occurred on numerous international space stations and space shuttle flights . in most of these events , the problem chemical(s )",
    "were either never identified or were identified only after the crew had been exposed to it .",
    "these represent significant health and safety risks to the crewmembers .",
    "real - time operating e - nose is designed to help reducing risks associated with crewmember exposure to toxic or dangerous chemicals . besides the safety issues , dealing with large memory requirement and computational reduction is another motivation for the investigation of real - time classification . however , constructing classifiers that are capable of early prediction is far from trivial . in the traditional sequence / time series classifiers ,",
    "the optimization goal is often set to maximize recognition rate .",
    "however , in early classification , the goal is to optimize the _ earliness _ as long as the classification accuracy is satisfactory .",
    "this paper proposes a model based on a set of serially located classifiers with a reject option to address the early classification of time - series .",
    "the first classifier makes a decision about the type of an incoming gas / odor based on a small portion of the signal available or rejects the sample leaving it to the next classifier .",
    "the decision making of the next classifier is based on the new portion of the time - series signal which could have been not available for the first classifier .",
    "the second classifier assigns a confident label to the sample or passes it to the next classifier in the set .",
    "this online process continues in this manner in an iterative manner .",
    "it is worth noting that the classification cost of a time - series signal by the second classifier is higher compared to that of the first one , since earliness of a decision making is important in the considered problem . at each step , the decision making will be made based on a portion of the available signal or it will be postponed to the next available patch of signal to be handled by the next classifier .",
    "this process can be repeated until a classifier is confident enough about the label or the cost of postponing the decision is too high .",
    "computational experiments focus on the bio - chemistry problem of odor classification . a novel electronic - nose called _ forefront - nose _",
    "is created based on the proposed model for early classification of time - series .",
    "the results obtained on the wind tunnel test - bed facility indicate the robustness of the forefront - nose compared to the standard classifiers from both earliness and recognition perspectives .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 provides a brief review of recent machine learning approaches in e - nose systems and relevant time - series classification approaches for the e - nose application ; section 3 focuses on the importance of early identification of time series signals ; section 4 presents first the theoretical framework of a classifier with a reject option and then introduces the proposed forefront - nose for early recognition of odor types ; section 5 presents the computational experiments starting from data acquisition and measurement procedure , forefront - nose hardware description to numerical analyses and comparisons ; and section 6 contains the conclusions of the paper .",
    "in this section , some recent important progresses in time - series classification of e - nose systems are discussed .",
    "wang et al @xcite proposed an approach based on the relevance vector machines ( rvm ) .",
    "the electronic nose data are first converted into principal components using the principal component analysis ( pca ) method and then directly sent as inputs to a rvm classifier .",
    "the experiments are performed using different combinations of original coffee data and compared to the support vector machines ( svm ) , the rvm method can provide similar classification accuracy with fewer kernel functions .    in @xcite , an olfactory neural network called the kiii model is introduced .",
    "the distributed open - ended structure of kiii model is compatible of any dimension of input vector but the more needed running time is costly . as an extension to their previous work , fu et al @xcite study the relationship between classification performance of the kiii model and the outer data factor , i.e. , the dimension of input feature vector , as well as the inner structure factor , i.e. , the amount of its corresponding parallel channels .",
    "the pca technique was applied for feature extraction and dimension reduction .",
    "two data sets of three classes of wine derived from different cultivars and five classes of green tea derived from five different provinces of china were used for experiments .",
    "svms are applied for olfactory signal recognition in @xcite .",
    "different types of kernels are experimented on two binary datasets and the results are compared to neural network algorithms i.e. radial basis functions and the error backpropagation algorithm . at the same research line , recently , vembu et al @xcite investigates the benefits of using time - series features and kernels for two tasks of odor discrimination and localization . in this work ,",
    "specialized features and kernels for time - series data are designed and used in conjunction with svms . to take full advantage of the temporal information in the data , vembu et al applied time - series models such as autoregressive models and linear dynamical systems to extract features from the input signal , and with designing similarity measures ( kernels ) for time series .",
    "the methods are validated on an extensive real data set collected in the wind tunnel test - bed facility ( used also for the experimental section of the current paper ) .",
    "trincavelli et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an electronic nose for identification of bacteria which is present in circulating blood and causes `` sepsis '' , also known as blood poisoning of septicaemia . for classification of each bacteria , during a measurement , the sampling cycle is repeated ten times .",
    "svm is applied independently to the ten samples , and therefore , ten estimates @xmath0 are obtained , where @xmath1 is the number of the sample for the same bacteria .",
    "this estimation is ensembled across ten consecutive responses of the same sample in order to make the classification more reliable .",
    "if a mean with significant superior confidence interval for a class is disjoint and above all the others then classification is performed ( assigning the sequence of samples to that class ) ; otherwise , a rejection is declared .",
    "the method uses features , which capture the static response ( the difference between the value that the sensor has at the end of the sampling phase minus the baseline value ) and dynamic ( the average of the derivative of the sensor during the first 3s of exposition of the array to the headspace ) properties of the signal from the gas sensor array .",
    "the main drawback of such system is re - measuring the same observation for many times .",
    "while in medical diagnoses it might make sense , this can be too costly and time consuming for online applications",
    ". an on - line and portable e - nose is designed and developed in @xcite for a qualitative discrimination among different high - concentration gas samples . the main refinement refers to using the pca method rather than a classification , building a system that can measure the quantitative and/or qualitative gas properties with a metric .",
    "it is observed that different concentration amounts of a specie follow a certain route in the pca plots , even if they are in different experiments .",
    "for temporal symbolic sequences and time - series , the values of a sequence are received in time stamp ascending order . sometimes , monitoring and classifying sequences as early as possible is desired . as mentioned above ,",
    "most of the existing methods assume that the data resides in main memory and is processed offline .",
    "however recent advances in sensor technologies require resource - efficient algorithms that can be implemented directly on the sensors as real - time algorithms .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "diez et al .",
    "@xcite first mentioned the concept of early recognition of time - series .",
    "they describe a time series by some relative literals , such as `` crease '' and `` stay '' , and some region literals , such as `` always '' and `` sometimes '' over some intervals .",
    "each literal and its associated position are viewed as a base classifier .",
    "adaboost @xcite is used to ensemble the base classifiers .",
    "the ensemble classifier is capable of making predictions on incomplete data by viewing unavailable suffixes of sequences as missing features .",
    "anibal et al .",
    "@xcite apply a case - based reasoning method to classify time series and monitor the system failure in a simulated dynamic system .",
    "the knn classifier is used to classify incomplete time series using various distances , such as euclidean distance and dynamic time warping ( dtw ) distance .",
    "the simulation studies show that , by using case - based reasoning , the most important increase of classification accuracy occurs on the prefixes through thirty to fifty percent of the full length .",
    "although in @xcite , the importance of early recognition on time series is identified and some encouraging results are shown , the study only treats early recognition as a problem of classifying prefixes of sequences .",
    "xing et al .",
    "@xcite point out that the challenge of early recognition is to study the trade - off between the earliness and the accuracy of classification .",
    "the methods proposed in @xcite only focus on making predictions based on partial information but do not address the issue of how to select the shortest prefix to provide a reliable prediction .",
    "this makes the result of early classification not easily used for further actions .",
    "xing et al .",
    "@xcite formulate the early recognition problem as classifying sequences as early as possible while maintaining an expected accuracy .",
    "a feature based method is proposed for early classification on temporal symbolic sequences .",
    "first , a set of features that are frequent , distinctive and early is selected and then an association rule classifier or a decision tree classifier using those features is built . in the classification step ,",
    "an incoming sequence is matched with all rules or branches simultaneously until on a prefix , a matching is found and the sequence is classified . in this way , a sequence is classified immediately once the user expected accuracy is achieved .",
    "the method proposed in @xcite shows some successes in handling symbolic sequences by achieving competitive accuracies using only less than half of the length of the full sequences .",
    "one disadvantage of the method from @xcite is that it can not handle numeric time series well .",
    "since numeric time series need to be discretized online , the information loss makes some distinctive features not easy to capture .",
    "xing et al .",
    "@xcite propose an early classifier for numeric time series by utilizing instance based learning .",
    "the method learns a minimal prediction length ( mpl ) for each time series in the training dataset through clustering and uses mpls to guide early classification . as shown in section 2 , 1nn classifier with euclidean distance",
    "is a highly accurate classifier for time series classification",
    ". one interesting property of the method in @xcite is that without requiring a user expected accuracy , the classifier can achieve early classification while maintaining roughly the same accuracy as a 1nn classifier using full length time series .",
    "early recognition has never been investigated for e - nose systems , although it has an essential importance for such an application .",
    "in fact , early classification of gas / odor time - series signals can benefit an e - nose from two different perspectives : i ) for industrial applications such as food industry , on - line odor / gas identification eliminates the need of waiting for entire time - series signal to be available ; ii ) and early detection of toxic treats caused by presence of poisonous gases / chemicals such as those in space shuttles .    despite the progress in e - nose development , there are two main issues with the state - of - the art systems .",
    "almost all classification techniques will take the entire signal , record it in memory and process it in order to make a decision .",
    "in other words , they function offline and this requires large amount of time which may cause problems in real - world applications",
    ". therefore , the _ `` earliness '' _ of the decision in e - nose applications has enormous importance .",
    "the second issue is the _ reliability _ of an e - nose output .",
    "once a label is assigned into a gas sample , the next question is `` how much does the user should trust this ? ''",
    ". a far more user friendly approach would be if the automatic system confirms itself the reliability of the label .",
    "this section presents the proposed method for early and accurate identification of odor types from time - series using a set of classifiers with a reject options ( cwro ) .",
    "multi - class classification refers to classifying observations that take values in an arbitrary feature space @xmath2 into one of @xmath3 classes .",
    "a discriminant function @xmath4 : @xmath2 @xmath5 @xmath6 yields a classifier @xmath7 that represents the guess of the label @xmath8 of a future observation @xmath2 and the error if the @xmath9 .",
    "bayes decision rule assigns each pattern @xmath10 to the class @xmath11 for which the a posteriori probability @xmath12 is maximum .",
    "@xmath13    since observations @xmath10 for which the conditional probability @xmath12 is close to 1/2 are difficult to classify , we introduce a reject option for classifiers , by allowing for a third decision called @xmath14 ( reject ) , expressing doubt , to be possible .",
    "the reject option is built by using a threshold value @xmath15 as follows . given a discriminant function @xmath4 : @xmath2 @xmath5 @xmath6 , we report @xmath16",
    "if @xmath17 , but we withhold decision if @xmath18 and report @xmath14 .    the classifier s accuracy is defined as the conditional probability that a pattern is correctly classified , given that it has been accepted :    @xmath19    we assume that the cost of making a wrong decision is 1 and the cost of utilizing the reject option is @xmath20 .",
    "value of @xmath21 includes both cost of passing time and lack of output .",
    "the appropriate risk function is then the following :    @xmath22 = \\mathbb{p } \\ { p(\\omega_{i } \\mid x_{\\omega_{j } } ) > \\tau \\ } + \\\\    d\\mathbb{p } \\ { p(\\omega_{i } \\mid x_{\\omega_{i } } ) \\leq \\tau \\ } \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]    for the discontinuous loss    @xmath23    since a reject decision is never triggered if @xmath24 , see @xcite , we restrict to the cases @xmath25 .",
    "the generalized bayes discriminant function , minimizing ( 2 ) , is then @xcite , @xcite :    @xmath26    with risk    @xmath27\\ ] ]    the case @xmath28 reduces to the classical situation without the reject option .",
    "we can view @xmath21 as an upper bound on the conditional probability of misclassification ( given @xmath29 ) that is considered tolerable .",
    "this subsection introduces a real - time e - nose system called _ forefront - nose _ for early and reliable recognition of gas signals .",
    "earliness of the decision comes from the fact that the proposed forefront - nose is using only a small portion of the time - series odor signal available at a time , rather than buffering the entire signal in the memory which would mean more waiting time .",
    "the system calculates the reliability score for a candidate label based on the first observations from the signal .",
    "if the score is high enough to report it to the user , the e - nose performs the classification .",
    "otherwise , the next portion of the signal is given to the system ( obviously increasing _",
    "`` cost '' _ ) .",
    "this process can continue until a reliable decision is made or the cost of decision is higher than a user - set threshold .",
    "besides the e - nose application perspective , forefront - nose presents an important contribution to the machine learning and pattern recognition field .",
    "the main core of the proposed forefront - nose is a novel cwro .",
    "let us recall that the standard approach to build a cwro hires a single classifier to calculate the `` posterior '' probability and then applies a threshold to reject or accept the decision .",
    "there are two drawbacks of such a system as follows : the first one is the need for one extra step for tunning the threshold and the other drawback is the dependency between the classifiers stability and the reliability of the output , meaning that if something goes wrong with the classifier , it can lead to a wrong decision by entire system .",
    "the proposed novel cwro model addresses both these issues by hiring two classifiers ( instead of one single expert ) and using their agreement to accept / reject an output ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "another advantage of such a system is that it is not necessarily limited to the classifiers with probabilistic outputs .",
    "for instance , standard knn or svm algorithms can not be used for cwro unless further operations applied first to obtain the posterior probability .",
    "furthermore , the standard way of taking advantage of an ensemble idea in cwro is to combine classifiers ( e.g. voting strategy ) in order to obtain the ensemble posterior probability and then apply a threshold . in the proposed approach , `` ensemble consensus '' directly plays a role about accept / reject decision .    the forefront - nose model is outlined in algorithm [ forefront - nose ] .    set parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 being @xmath33 time interval available in time .",
    "* training *    @xmath34for each @xmath35 do :    @xmath36for each @xmath37 do :    @xmath38build a classifier @xmath39    @xmath36select",
    "@xmath40 most accurate classifiers    @xmath36calculate @xmath41 for each pair of the selected classifiers    @xmath36build @xmath42 diversity matrix    @xmath36select the pair @xmath43 with highest diversity for cwro    * testing *    @xmath34for each @xmath35 do :    @xmath36apply @xmath43 to make accept / reject decision based on the agreement rule    @xmath36if decision = accept do :    @xmath38 @xmath44= @xmath45    @xmath38 exit    there is no agreement under what circumstances an ensemble of classifiers obtains a better accuracy compared to the individuals .",
    "however , it is both practically and theoretically proven that an ensemble of classifiers is more stable ( reliable ) in the decision making process .",
    "there are two main factors to be considered to build a _",
    "`` good '' _ ensemble : individual accuracy and diversity among them . according to this idea ,",
    "several studies advocate the method of producing a pool of classifiers followed by a selection procedure to pick the classifiers that are most diverse and accurate @xcite . in forefront - nose , we first build an svm classifier for each @xmath46 ( the svm - specific parameters ) and select @xmath40 classifiers with best recognition rates .",
    "the diversity measure is then used to form a pairwise diversity matrix for a classifier pool and subsequently to select classifiers that are least related . for this purpose",
    ", we use the double fault measure @xcite in this study .",
    "the double fault measure is an intuitive choice for diversity measure as it gives the probability of both classifiers @xmath47 and @xmath48 being incorrect :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the ratio of the number of samples which both classifiers misclassified at the same time to total number of evaluated samples",
    ". this measure is based on the concept that it is more important to know when simultaneous errors are committed than when both classifiers are correct .",
    "thus this measure is appropiate for incorporation in the proposed cwro .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath41 is a _ pairwise _ measure that considers a pair of classifiers at the time .",
    "therefore , the diversity matrix for @xmath40 given classifiers is a @xmath42 symmetric matrix with diagonal array representing minimum pairwise diversity value .",
    "computational experiments focus on an extensive real data set collected in the wind tunnel test - bed facility @xcite . in the following subsections",
    ", we will first describe the sensors used in our experiments as well as the data sets and the measurement protocol .",
    "we will then present the experimental results obtained from applying the proposed forefront - nose on the wind tunnel dataset .",
    "chemo - resistive sensing principles , such as polymers and metal - oxide based sensor technologies , are sensitive to rapid changes in the analyte concentration at the measurement location , while performing reasonably well in discriminating the said chemical analytes @xcite .",
    "their high spatio - temporal resolution distinguishes them as suitable receptors in ambient conditions , especially for the prediction problems addressed in this paper ( i.e. , gas discrimination / identification and gas source localization ) .",
    "accordingly , we utilized a portable array module endowed with 8 commercialized metal - oxide gas sensors , provided by figaro inc .",
    "@xcite , to record a gas plume generated in the wind tunnel facility ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the sensing principle is based on oxidation / de - oxidation of the analyte while in interaction with the active surface .",
    "such oxygen / electron exchange between the pollutant analyte and the sensitive surface induces a change in the surface conductance , which is measured in the form of a resistance , or conductance , time - series across the electrodes of the sensor @xcite .        in our particular experiment",
    ", we set the operating temperatures by following an empirical analysis described as follows : ( i ) in a gas delivery manifold ( i.e. , an isolated chamber series to a computer - supervised continuous flow system ) , each sensor was repeatedly subjected to each candidate analyte by increasing concentration .",
    "( ii ) then , for each sensor type , the admissible range of surface temperatures ( i.e. , sensor s heater voltages ) was swept , and the value maximizing the response dynamic range over these presentations was determined .",
    "( iii ) this empirical optimum is assigned as the measurement parameter for just one of the two sensors of that specific sensor type on the portable array .",
    "the heater voltage of the other element in the pair is then set to 5 volts2 , which is a generic value equal to the mid - point of the admissible voltage range suggested by the manufacturer .",
    "a gas plume emitted from a fixed chemical source location conveys two critical pieces of information to the spatial coordinates within its volume : the analyte identity and the displacement vector from the source to the observer .",
    "the problems of chemical source identification and localization are individually not novel to the fields of sensory signal processing and pattern recognition .",
    "while chemical identification is a genuine classification problem , in which various mainstream methods have been successful thanks to the executive quantifications and metrics that have been recently established in the chemosensory community @xcite .",
    "we collected the data set utilizing a portable sensor array module endowed with eight metal - oxide gas sensors manufactured by figaro inc . @xcite",
    "positioned at different fixed locations within a gas plume generated in the wind tunnel test - bed facility .",
    "the first data set induces a ten - gas classification problem , in which the goal is to discriminate four analytes , namely , carbon monoxide , ammonia , methane , acetaldehyde , benzene , butanol , ethylene , methanol , toluene and acetone , regardless of the location of the sensory system module within the annotated wind tunnel test - bed facility .",
    "it comprises 504 8-dimensional time series responses each dimension corresponds to each sensor utilized observed at the locations ( that we call landmarks ) indicated in the wind tunnel shown in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "this data set thus induces a ten - gas classification problem , i.e. , determining the odor chemical source identity regardless of the position of the sensing layer module .          in collecting",
    "our above described data set , we utilized a 2.5 m @xmath51 1.2 m @xmath51 0.4 m wind tunnel , where the geometry of the problem , the location of the odor source and our chemo - sensory platform , as well as the controllable flow conditions are shown , for each case of study , in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the considered wind tunnel has a non - inclined floor , which allows us to disregard the altitude dimension of the field . in constructing the above mentioned data sets , we adopted the following protocol .",
    "first , an artificial air flow of 0.10 m / s was induced into the wind tunnel by an exhaust fan rotating at a constant speed of 1500 rpm , which , in turn , allowed us to , both , avoid saturation of the test volume to analytes and provide a turbulent flow in the wind tunnel , as reflected in the time series responses recorded from the chemical sensors under the turbulent environment ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the air flow was measured utilizing two 2-d ultrasonic anemometers , by gill windsonic , each of which allocated at different positions throughout the entire wind tunnel before starting the recordings of the analytes .",
    "afterwards , one of the above pre - defined fixed locations was selected to allocate our chemo - sensory module and the wind tunnel was then sealed to avoid the presence of leaks and external interfering odors in the room and wind tunnel , respectively , while performing our measurement recordings .",
    "once the air flow and the remaining ambient conditions have assume a quasi - stationary situation in the wind tunnel , one of the analytes was randomly chosen and released at the source location mark , indicated in the figure [ fig:3 ] , and held circulating through the tunnel for several minutes before starting the actual recordings .",
    "this stage constitutes a preliminary phase , which was utilized to `` stabilize '' the sensors responses in the presence of the chemical anlaytes in the wind tunnel and ensure that only the stochasticity of the turbulent air flow in presence of the different substances being released in the wind tunnel were reflected in the sensors responses .",
    "subsequently , each measurement , that consisted of an 8-channel time series representing the time profile of the sensor resistances in response to each analyte being studied , was recorded for three minutes and stored in our data set repository for further processing .",
    "after that step , the source was removed , the wind tunnel was ventilated and the hood was left open for one minute , before a new measurement location and/or analyte type were set for subsequent measurements .",
    "this measurement procedure was exactly recreated for each chemical analyte and landmark location until all pairs were covered .",
    "each measurement was recorded at a sampling rate of 100 hz .",
    "note that there is no symmetry in the spatial distribution of a plume with respect to the main axis ( i.e. , the line connecting the source to the exhaust ) . a plume demonstrating a perfect symmetry in real conditions is rare due to the non - symmetry of the volume enclosing the field , the inhomogeneous temperature , and the variability of the ow direction . in the setup phase of the data collection we found in all trials that the selected features evaluated at symmetric coordinates were strictly different . yet , as we show next , the non - symmetric plume structure is reproducible so that the predictions can be extended in time , i.e. , by referring to earlier observations at the same environment .    in all our experiments",
    ", we reduced the length of time series ( i.e. , down - sampled ) by averaging over windows of size 10 samples within the same time series in order to speed up computations .",
    "to evaluate the proposed forefront - nose , the classification performance assessed by the 10-fold cross - validation provides realistic generalization accuracy for unseen data . also , we calculated the deviation of a time - series data and set a threshold to detect the rising point of the signal i.e. presence of a gas in the wind tunnel .",
    "in all experiments , we have used svm classifiers with a rbf kernels , varying both @xmath52 and @xmath53 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 in order to find a best parameters .    in the first phase of our experiments",
    ", we have run a classifier on all over the wind tunnel to investigate the signal strength and discriminability ( see figure [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "then , we have compared the recognition rate of a standard classifier with a reject option to the standard classifier to see possible drop / raise in the performance .",
    "first @xmath35 points of a time - series signal is given as an input , since we are interested in early recognition .",
    "in this particular case , we choosed @xmath56 which is equivalent of 5 seconds .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig:5 ] in which the x axis indicates the index of the 45 locations spread all over the wind tunnel .",
    "as shown , the results encourage the use the cwro which has a performance superior to a standard classifier .",
    "furthermore , in order to verify the improvement related to early recognition , we compared the performance of the proposed forefront - nose with the standard cwro ( see table [ tab:9 ] ) .",
    "the comparison is made for different earliness of a time - series in order to obtain results with no dependency with the signal length .",
    "therefore , we have varied @xmath35 from 5 to 30 seconds .",
    "we report the results for each @xmath35 by averaging the recognition rate over all 45 locations in the wind tunnel .",
    "the comparative results confirm the robustness of the proposed forefront - nose with respect to the commonly used standard cwro .",
    "since the forefront - nose gets the maximum performance using @xmath57 , this amount of time seems to be optimum for both early and accurate recognition of different gas types .",

    "a new architecture is proposed for a classifier with a reject option using ensemble of experts .",
    "the approach requires the ensemble s `` agreement '' in order to accept a candidate label rather than relying only on single expert s posterior probability as suggested by standard methods .",

    "<S> early classification of time - series data in a dynamic environment is a challenging problem of great importance in signal processing . </S>",
    "<S> this paper proposes a classifier architecture with a reject option capable of online decision making without the need to wait for the entire time series signal to be present . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is to classify an odor / gas signal with an acceptable accuracy as early as possible . instead of using posterior probability of a classifier , the proposed method uses the `` agreement '' of an ensemble to decide whether to accept or reject the candidate label . </S>",
    "<S> the introduced algorithm is applied to the bio - chemistry problem of odor classification to build a novel electronic - nose called _ forefront - nose_. experimental results on wind tunnel test - bed facility confirms the robustness of the forefront - nose compared to the standard classifiers from both earliness and recognition perspectives . </S>"
