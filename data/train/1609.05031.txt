    "one of the central questions in turbulent convection is that of the global transport of heat and momentum as a function of the thermal driving and the properties of the working fluid @xcite . in the simplest setting of turbulent convection  the rayleigh - bnard case  one considers an infinitely extended horizontal layer of fluid which is uniformly heated from below and cooled from above . the thermal driving of the turbulent convection in the layer is then established by the temperature difference between the top and the bottom , @xmath1 , and directly proportional to the dimensionless rayleigh number @xmath2 .",
    "the properties of the working fluid are determined by the prandtl number @xmath3 , defined as the ratio of the kinematic viscosity @xmath4 to the thermal diffusivity @xmath5 .",
    "turbulent heat and momentum transfer are quantified by the dimensionless nusselt , @xmath6 , and reynolds , @xmath7 , numbers , respectively . in a nutshell ,",
    "one seeks for @xmath6 and @xmath7 being functions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "one of the oldest scaling theories that aimed at predicting @xmath8 at fixed @xmath3 dates back to malkus @xcite and is based on a marginal stability argument for the turbulent mean profiles .",
    "more recently , scaling theories by shraiman and siggia @xcite and grossmann and lohse ( gl ) @xcite have been developed .",
    "the central idea of the gl theory is a decomposition of the thermal and kinetic energy dissipation into contributions from the bulk and the boundary layers in the vicinity of the plates .",
    "these contributions have to be weighted with the volume fractions that the boundary layers of the temperature and velocity fields occupy .",
    "the theory is adapted to doubly diffusive convection @xcite and horizontal convection @xcite .    in astrophysical systems ,",
    "thermal convection is often tightly coupled to magnetic fields ( and rotation ) which is known as magnetoconvection @xcite .",
    "examples are sunspots in the solar chromosphere @xcite or the x - ray flaring activity of some young neutron stars which are termed magnetars @xcite . less spectacular , but not less important",
    "are numerous industrial applications reaching from materials processing , such as crystal growth by the czochralski method @xcite or dendritic solidification in alloys @xcite , to fusion technology @xcite . in case of a strong prescribed magnetic induction",
    "@xmath9 the secondary magnetic induction @xmath10 , which is generated by flow - induced eddy currents , remains very small .",
    "while a strong vertical external field can then damp and even suppress the convective fluid motion @xcite , convection rolls can be stabilized when the magnetic field is applied in horizontal direction @xcite . from a standard magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) perspective , the turbulence of coupled velocity and magnetic fields is then constrained .",
    "this regime is known as the quasistatic regime of mhd : the lorentz force enters the momentum equation , the induction equation which describes the temporal evolution of the magnetic induction field @xmath10 is however neglected @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend the gl theory of turbulent transport to the case of magnetoconvection .",
    "first attempts in this direction have been reported by chakraborty @xcite .",
    "he showed that an ohmic dissipation rate , @xmath11 , has to be incorporated beside the thermal and kinetic energy dissipation rates , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "one is thus left with eight different regimes of boundary - layer- and/or bulk - dominated dissipation rates .",
    "together with free parameters for the viscous boundary layer thickness and a critical reynolds number for the crossover from low to high prandtl numbers @xcite , one ends up with at least ten parameters to fit .",
    "furthermore , dimensionless parameters have to be added that relate the electrical conductivity @xmath14 either to the kinematic viscosity or the thermal diffusivity and quantify the strength of the outer magnetic field . in view to this significant extension of the parameter space",
    ", one has to seek for regimes of magnetoconvection that can be studied with a reduced set of fit parameters",
    ".    we will therefore restrict the turbulent magnetoconvection to a specific parameter range . in view to a comparison with laboratory experiments of magnetoconvection , which are typically conducted in liquid metals , one can restrict the prandtl number range to @xmath15 also the range of the magnetic prandtl number @xmath16 can be limited to @xmath17 with the diffusivity of the magnetic induction @xmath18 and @xmath19 being the permeability .",
    "in many laboratory flows the magnetic reynolds number @xmath20 will thus remain small , @xmath21 .",
    "this regime is termed the _",
    "quasistatic _ case of magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "the magnetic field lines can not be bended significantly by the fluid motion since the magnetic diffusion time scale is very short .",
    "this excludes some astrophysical applications such as interstellar turbulent gases in which @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "similar to standard gl theory , our predictions have to be fitted to one reference data set .",
    "our adjustment of the free coefficients will be based on an experiment by cioni et al .",
    "@xcite which is to the best of our knowledge the only experiment that was operated at a sufficiently high rayleigh number",
    ". further data records by burr and mller @xcite and aurnou and olson @xcite have been conducted at smaller rayleigh numbers and will be discussed only briefly .",
    "in addition , our own direct numerical simulations of magnetoconvection in the quasistatic regime will be included to obtain ( at least one ) data point with known reynolds and nusselt numbers at given rayleigh , hartmann ( the dimensionless measure for magnetic field strength which will be defined in section ii ) and prandtl numbers .",
    "the outline of the work is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the set of magnetoconvective equations of motion is discussed , the characteristic scales , dimensionless parameters and dissipation rates are defined .",
    "also the numerical method and a short description of the data sets will be presented .",
    "this section is followed by a derivation of the nonlinear equations for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "the program applies mpi and open mp .",
    "more details are found in @xcite .",

    "it results from the joule dissipation in the presence of a magnetic field . for completeness",
    ", we also list the definition of the magnetic reynolds number @xmath64 where @xmath65 is again given by the root mean square velocity , @xmath66 .",

    "the following modifications are made to predict @xmath67 and @xmath68 for our case at hand :    1 .",
    "the relevant boundary layer for the velocity field is the hartmann layer @xcite ( see also appendix ) , @xmath69 while the thermal boundary layer thickness remains @xmath70 .",
    "contrary to the original gl theory we do not have the free parameter @xmath71 that appears in the prandtl - blasius - type expression @xmath72 .",
    "we limit the study to low prandtl numbers as already mentioned in the introduction .",
    "thus the modification for the limit of large prandtl numbers which has been developed in @xcite and the related parameter @xmath73 are not necessary here .",
    "this saves a second fit parameter .",
    "it is well - known from the linear stability analysis @xcite that the critical rayleigh number @xmath74 scales as @xmath75 if @xmath37 is too big at a given @xmath2 , convection is suppressed completely .",
    "the mean energy dissipation rates will be composed of a boundary layer contribution and a bulk contribution .",
    "this results to @xmath76 the dimensional estimates of the different contributions are given by @xmath77 the bulk scalings of the kinetic and thermal dissipation rates in and are the same as in the original gl theory @xcite .",
    "the argumentation in @xcite that leads to remains valid for the present case .",
    "however , the scaling relation in differs to the original case . instead of",
    "the original bl expression @xmath78 , we insert the hartmann layer thickness . for the new estimates in and we use the definition of @xmath11 which is given in and measure the induced magnetic field @xmath10 in units of @xmath79 .    following grossmann and lohse @xcite",
    ", we introduce interpolation functions to account for changes of the scaling laws in different parameter regimes . once @xmath80 becomes smaller than @xmath81 the dominant velocity in the thermal bl changes from @xmath65 to @xmath82 .",
    "this is accounted for by replacing @xmath7 with @xmath83 in and , where @xmath84 with the argument @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for this interpolation function",
    "follows that @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "close to the critical rayleigh number the bulk of the fluid becomes laminar and @xmath89 scales with @xmath90 rather than @xmath91 as in for the turbulent regime .",
    "this change is modelled by multiplying with @xmath92 with the argument @xmath93 . from the definition of @xmath94",
    "follows that @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath97 marks the range in which the transition from fully developed turbulence to weakly nonlinear time - dependent regime of velocity dynamics takes place . combining all pure scaling laws with the interpolations as just described gives @xmath98 @xmath99 with the seven a priori unknown model parameters @xmath97 and @xmath100 to @xmath101 which have to be determined from a data record .",
    "the set of implicit equations can then be solved to obtain expressions @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "while it is not possible to find a full solution analytically , @xmath7 can be calculated from as a function of @xmath6 , @xmath2 , @xmath37 and @xmath3 : @xmath104 inserting into gives an equation independent of @xmath7 .",
    "however this new equation can not be solved analytically for @xmath6 .    the stabilizing effect ( iii ) of large @xmath37 is included here in the following way : assuming we have found an analytical expression @xmath105 we can enforce the transition to the non - convective regime at @xmath106 by multiplying @xmath107 with @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "the function @xmath110 obeys the properties @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which ensures that @xmath113 in the purely diffusive equilibrium .",
    "the crossover function transitions smoothly between these two states , so that at @xmath106 we have @xmath114 instead of an abrupt jump to zero .",
    "since we can not determine @xmath107 directly we transform @xmath115 into @xmath116 and in the @xmath7-independent equation we replace @xmath117 by @xmath118 .",
    "this gives the same result of @xmath119 in the non - convective regime once the equation is solved for @xmath6 by numerical methods .",
    "thus the final model equations are and @xmath120 with @xmath121 now can be used to determine the seven model parameters @xmath97 and @xmath100 to @xmath101 by fitting the equation to a data set @xmath122 .",
    "however examining shows , that it is invariant for the following transformations : @xmath123 for any @xmath124 .",
    "this means that the optimal values for the model parameters are ambiguous . to fix this ambiguity",
    "we need at least one data point @xmath125 which includes the reynolds number .",
    "then can be used to calculate @xmath101 as a function of @xmath126 : @xmath127 with this step the optimal values of all remaining six model parameters @xmath97 and @xmath100 to @xmath126 are unique . it is absolutely clear that six parameters , which have to be adjusted , is still a large number .",
    "nevertheless , one has to keep in mind that the number of free parameters has already been reduced significantly .",
    "we are not aware of any publications that report magnetoconvection data sets including @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we are using our own numerical simulations to determine data points @xmath125 for evaluating .",

    "furthermore , the line is displayed for which @xmath136 . above this line the hartmann layer thickness will be smaller as the thermal boundary layer thickness .",
    "this characteristic line is crossed by a second line that shows @xmath137 . as mentioned already in section [ gl_ext ] ( see equation ( [ hac ] ) ) , on the left side of this line",
    "the convection flow is not fully developed turbulent , but in weakly nonlinear and time - dependent convection state .",
    "all data which are to the right of this line can be considered as fully turbulent convection data .",
    "it can be seen that only a few data points of @xcite cross this threshold .",
    "the parameter space , thus , splits into four subregions by both lines :    * region i : weakly nonlinear flow and strong magnetic field * region ii : fully developed turbulent flow and strong magnetic field * region iii : fully developed turbulent flow and weaker magnetic field * region iv : weakly nonlinear flow and weaker magnetic field     to @xmath126 when fixing the sixth coefficient @xmath138 .",
    "negative values of @xmath139 and @xmath140 are indicated by a dashed line . ]",
    "a few words about the quality of the fit should be addressed now .",
    "first , we mention that the size of the error bars of all fit coefficients ( except @xmath101 ) is of the order of 100  % . in case of the coefficient @xmath139 this error level is even exceeded ( see also next paragraphs ) .",
    "this is caused by the sparse record of data points .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the data of cioni et al .",
    "@xcite are collected for three different hartmann numbers that cover a small range . also , these data reach only to the beginning of regime ii .",
    "regimes iii and iv do not contain any data points .",
    "stevens et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated in their recent update of gl theory that the uncertainties in the coefficients can be significantly reduced when the data cover a wide range of parameters .",
    "furthermore , these three hartmann numbers are much larger than those from our dns .",
    "the additional data by burr and mller @xcite or by aurnou and olson @xcite have been conducted close to the onset regime of convection .",
    "their experimental data are thus rather in the weakly nonlinear than in the fully turbulent range and will not be used for our study .",
    "secondly , it is observed that two fit coefficients , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , are negative .",
    "although @xmath141 and thus practically zero , the corresponding term in ( [ modelnu ] ) can give a non - negligible contribution to the scaling due to @xmath142 .",
    "coefficient @xmath139 with the biggest error bar needs further consideration .",
    "figure [ fitc2 ] displays the five coefficients in dependence of a fixed @xmath138 . to get this figure",
    ", we repeated the fits at each fixed value of the crossover reynolds number .",
    "it is seen that the results for @xmath100 to @xmath126 are nearly insensitive for @xmath143 . beyond this value ,",
    "coefficient @xmath139 changes sign which is indicated by a dashed line in the plot .",
    "the eventual value of @xmath139 falls into a range , where small variations of @xmath138 cause large changes of @xmath139 ( including sign changes ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath144 in our fit corresponds to a rayleigh number of @xmath145 .",
    "this estimate follows from recent numerical studies in liquid metal convection without magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it falls thus consistently into the range , for which convection develops into the fully developed turbulent regime which is also known as the hard convective turbulence regime @xcite . at the moment",
    ", we can only speculate that the inclusion of more data could lower the value of @xmath138 as it is expected in low-@xmath3 convection ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thirdly , in order to quantify the impact of the error bars of the fit coefficients on @xmath146 and @xmath147 , we proceeded as follows .",
    "the six coefficients @xmath148 and @xmath138 were chosen randomly and statistically independently within their error bars . with these 6-tuples the parameter dependence @xmath146 and @xmath147",
    "is reconstructed for 118 different cases .",
    "the superposition of these individual realizations results in an relative error around the original value in figure [ phase ] .",
    "the magnitudes of the relative error of both , nusselt and reynolds number , are plotted in logarithmic units in figure [ phase_err ] .",
    "the relative error of @xmath6 is highest along the border between regime i and ii , but does not exceed 40  % . on the other hand the relative uncertainty of @xmath7 rises for smaller @xmath2 and reaches more than 100  % for @xmath2 below @xmath149 .",
    "we have presented an extension of the scaling theory of grossmann and lohse @xcite to a convection layer in the presence of a vertical magnetic field .",
    "the discussion is restricted to magnetoconvection at low prandtl and magnetic prandtl numbers . in this regime",
    "the quasistatic approximation is applied that allows a significant reduction of the number of free parameters in the flow at hand and thus an application of the ideas of gl theory . below the chandrasekhar limit four",
    "different convection regimes are identified . on the one hand , they follow from the ratio of the hartmann and thermal boundary layer thicknesses . on the other hand",
    ", the regions result from the critical reynolds number @xmath138 , beyond which the convection flow is assumed to be fully turbulent .",
    "in contrast to standard rayleigh - bnard convection , the data base is very small .",
    "in fact , there is only one data set from cioni and co - workers , that can be used to fit the free parameters .",
    "the remaining data @xcite fall into a completely different section of the parameter plane .",
    "in particular , they remain close to the chandrasekhar limit and can not be used for turbulent magnetoconvection .",
    "this limits the predictive capabilities of our scaling results and calls for additional experimental data which are planed in the near future .",
