    "the evidence of neutrino oscillation implies that at least two neutrinos are massive @xcite .",

    ", one can easily derive the lower limit on the sum of neutrino mass @xmath6 . on the other hand , the measurement of the angular anisotropies of the comic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation puts the upper limit on the sum of neutrino mass @xmath7 as reported by _ planck _",
    "2015 @xcite , and future 21 cm and precise cmb polarization observations @xcite .    massive neutrino cosmology has already been studied extensively in the literature ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) . in the early universe before the last scattering of the cmb photons , the neutrinos play the role as cosmic radiation because of their small total mass , affecting the matter - radiation equality time .",
    "this is the so - called early integrated sacks - wolfe ( eisw ) effect , which can be observed from the first peak position of cmb temperature anisotropic power spectrum .",
    "subsequently in the matter and dark energy domination eras , neutrinos become non - relativistic and contribute to the total matter density in the universe at the background and perturbation levels .",
    "therefore , the geometric and dynamic measurements are useful to determine the neutrino mass .    in the past few years",
    ", the linear perturbation theory with the presence of neutrino mass has been well understood @xcite . in the early universe , when the neutrino behaves with relativistic degrees of freedom , its density fluctuation does not grow .",
    "once neutrino thermal energy drops below its mass , it becomes non - relativistic at a redshift @xmath8 @xmath9 thereafter , neutrino contributes to the total dark matter background density @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is related to the present hubble parameter @xmath12 .",
    "after the non - relativistic transition , the free streaming scale of neutrino changes from the hubble scale to @xmath13 which has a minimum at @xmath14 @xmath15 in the matter domination , considering @xmath16 @xcite . here , the scale @xmath17 is the largest scale that can be affected by the presence of neutrino fluctuation . on smaller scales @xmath18 ,",
    "density fluctuations are washed out , while on larger scales @xmath19 neutrino behaves as cold dark matter .",
    "thus , at sufficiently small scales @xmath20 , the power spectrum of matter @xmath21 is depressed due to the lack of neutrino power .",
    "this is due to the modification of the linear evolution of density perturbation at small scales @xmath20 by the presence of the neutrino @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being the density and the overdensity of matter respectively ; the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath26 , and @xmath27 reads as @xcite @xmath28 in an einstein - de sitter universe , one has a simple solution of the eq .",
    "( [ eq : perneutrino ] ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "thus the suppression of the matter power spectrum is crudely estimated to be @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "as expected , this suppression will change the relation between the potentials and matter density contrast at small scales @xmath20 in the presence of neutrino , as @xmath31=-8\\pi g a^2\\bar{\\rho}(1-f_{\\nu})\\delta(\\vec{x},\\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the bardeen s curvature perturbation during the matter - dominated era and is related to the trace of metric as @xmath33 , whereas @xmath34 is given by the component @xmath35 . in the absence of significant sources of anisotropic stress , one gets @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ eq : perneutrino ] ) follows from the above poisson equation with vanishing anisotropic stress . in the linear perturbation theory ,",
    "the evolution of the density fluctuation does not depend on the scales , so that the density fluctuation can be factorized as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the initial density fluctuation .",
    "then the perturbation equation ( [ eq : perneutrino ] ) becomes @xmath39 at small scales @xmath20 in the presence of neutrino , where @xmath40 is the growth factor .",
    "the suppression of the matter power spectrum at scales @xmath20 in the presence of neutrino changes the depth of gravitational potential in the path of the cmb photons propagating from the last scattering surface to us .",
    "this modification finds signature in the anisotropies of the cmb photons caused by the gravitational anisotropies , which are observed as the gravitational lensing , the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effects and its non - linear extension , rees - sciama ( rs ) effect @xcite .",
    "of course , the scattering secondaries ( including the thermal and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( t / ksz ) effect ) will also enter into the final anisotropies of the cmb photons @xcite .",
    "but in this work we will mainly focus on rs effect due to its sensitivity to the neutrino mass . and",
    "the tsz effect can be removed because of its frequency dependence of the photon intensities .    below an arc minute scale ,",
    "the temperature fluctuation caused by rs effect is of the order @xmath41 @xcite , which is smaller than that of primary cmb or that of thermal sz effect by order of magnitude three @xcite . for extracting this tiny fluctuation of rs effect in the total cmb temperature fluctuations",
    ", it should be correlated with the matter distribution of large scale structure ( lss ) , because the rs effect is generated by the lss .",
    "the distribution of matter could be measured by the distribution of galaxy distribution and statistics of weak lensing . however , the galaxy distribution has crucial disadvantage due to the bias problem , @xmath42 , i.e. , the density contrast of galaxy is proportional to that of dark matter @xcite . on large scales where the density contrast is small @xmath43 ,",
    "this relation is viable , but on small scales the relation is not valid and the bias largely depends on the survey , thus on the galaxy population and the scale @xmath44 , say @xmath45 for instance @xcite .",
    "thus the galaxy distribution will not be reliable or robust tracer for the matter distribution .",
    "for instance , the convergence of weak lensing never suffers from the bias problem @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the cross - correlation between rs-@xmath46 ( the convergence of lensing ) is about @xmath47 , which is much larger than that of ksz effect @xcite . as far as the non - linear extension of isw effect , i.e rs effect ,",
    "is concerned , one has to understand the non - linear matter power spectrum , which is the incarnation of the distribution of matter at small scales .",
    "usually , the non - linear matter power spectrum can be obtained from the n - body simulation , the halo model @xcite , or the standard perturbation theory ( spt ) @xcite .",
    "we will mainly focus on the third order spt theory , because it can easily be extended to various cosmological models as compared to the n - body simulation and halo model , and also provides exact calculation in the quasi - linear regime @xcite .",
    "but it should be noted that the main conclusion obtained in this work does not depend on any nonlinear power spectrum method , because the sign flipping of cross - correlation power spectrum @xmath48 is a common feature of the non - linear evolution of the density contrast at the smaller scales .",
    "of course , one expects that different method will give almost the same nonlinear power spectrum , if the methods are consistent .",
    "this is also the other main reason to use spt in this work .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : ccrsspt ] , we give a brief introduction to the cross correlation between rs-@xmath46 ( the convergence of lensing ) and standard perturbation theory ( spt ) , where the non - linear matter matter power spectrum at the third order will be presented . in section [ sec : sfsnr ] , the dependence of the sign flipping of @xmath48 on @xmath49 is given .",

    "however , we need the cross correlation angular power spectrum below arc minute scale , where the power spectrum requires the non - linear treatment . for doing that , the third order spt should be employed . in this work",

    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 , and for the @xmath75cdm model , the second order variables are given by @xcite @xmath85 it should be noted that the above expansion is not exactly correct even in the @xmath75cdm model .",
    "however , it was reported that the largest deviation in the density perturbation variables from the cosmology is almost entirely encoded into the linear growth factor , and the contribution from other terms can be less than one percent @xcite .",
