    "chaos control and chaotic synchronization have been one of the most attractive fields of applied nonlinear dynamics for almost two decades in physics @xcite , engineering @xcite , chemical and biological systems @xcite and others .",

    "the importance of chaotic synchronization in complex systems has only gradually been clarified @xcite .",
    "+ chaotic synchronization means that two or more dynamical systems , which are coupled with each other , can correlate their dynamic behavior , even in the case when each system shows irregular behavior . in general , various grades of synchronization can be obtained depending on the coupled elements but also essentially on the form and strength of the couplings . here",
    "we will focus on the strongest form of synchronization called _ complete _ or _ identical _ synchronization , which means that the trajectories of the coupled systems coincide exactly . in the case of two identical chaotic systems",
    "complete synchronization can be achieved by _ non - invasive _ couplings .",
    "this means that all coupling forces vanish as soon as the synchronized state has been reached , and the synchronized state will be in exact agreement with the previously uncoupled states .",
    "+ recently the importance of latency effects in the coupling mechanism have attracted major attention both from the aspect of practical applications and for principle reasons .",
    "for example , when developing a high speed cryptographic communication system based on chaotic synchronization @xcite , it will be most important to understand the influence of latency times within the whole complex system .",
    "many recent investigations of this problem refer to coupled lasers , e.g. @xcite , because of their fast characteristic time scales , but also owing to the intrinsic applications of delay lines to make a single laser element chaotic .",
    "+ delay effects may , however , substantially change the mechanism of chaotic synchronization .",
    "it is evident that for two irregular time - dependent signals @xmath0 and @xmath1 any time delay in the coupling forces has the tendency to create a mismatch in time and will impede the state of complete synchronization .",
    "this was the reason for the previous opinion that chaotic systems with mutual time - delayed couplings could never synchronize completely .",
    "obviously they can not synchronize in a non - invasive way , like unstable periodic orbits @xcite or like chaotic systems with instantaneous @xcite or unidirectional @xcite couplings .",
    "instead non - zero delay in bidirectional couplings will always result in strong control forces which have to overcome the deviations of identical irregular signals with some time lag .",
    "this makes the coupling _",
    "invasive_. in this context it has been recently realized that more complicated coupling schemes including additional self - feedback may partly remove the influence of delay from the eqs .",
    "of motion of the coupled systems @xcite , but even then the principle conflict between delayed couplings and the synchronization of irregular signals is still maintained .",
    "of course there will be further constraints , and we may expect that the tendency of nearby trajectories to exponentially diverge can not be suppressed by delayed couplings for very large delay times @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we focus on the most simple coupling scheme and investigate two identical low - dimensional chaotic oscillators that are mutually coupled via a single time - delayed component .",
    "we study , both experimentally and analytically , the mutual and auto - synchronization effects that appear in this configuration .",

    "@xmath98 the longitudinal equation represents exactly the floquet problem well - known for pyragas control .",

    "@xcite . however , there is still the transversal solution to be stabilized .",
    "the transversal equation coincides almost completely with the longitudinal one , but the delay term has the opposite sign .",
    "this means for our floquet problem that , whenever the @xmath84-torsion of a periodic orbit provides successful stabilization in the longitudinal direction , the inverted delay term and the torsion cancel each other in the transversal subspace , just as if the orbit was torsion - free .",
    "the stability dilemma is exactly the same as for the fixed point of our system at half - period delay : for the presented coupling scheme at least one direction of the complete phase space remains unstable .",
    "but this is not an absolute restriction .",
    "stable synchronized periodic oscillations may occur when the delay time is detuned from the orbit period , as can be seen in fig .",

    "as mentioned in the preceding section , there could be an overlap between the domains of longitudinal and transversal stability , but only if the restriction @xmath100 is fulfilled together with a @xmath85 torsion . for fixed points",

    "the situation is more complicated , since the orbits also get deformed by the invasive feedback for @xmath101 .",

    "complete synchronization of chaotic trajectories is observed for very small delay times @xmath102 but also for rather large delay times @xmath103 , see fig .  [ ktauexp1 ] .",
    "the first result is intuitively expected since it occurs close to the limit of conventional chaotic synchronization . this process is well established , and a slight change of the synchronization signal should not immediately spoil the whole mechanism . the synchronization at @xmath103 , however , was extremely surprising , even more when taking into consideration that the delay time exceeds the chaotic memory , i.e. the lyapunov time , of the uncoupled chaotic oscillator , by about factor 2 .",
    "we evaluated this characteristic time to amount to @xmath104 @xcite .",

    "a necessary criterion for chaotic synchronization is @xmath114 while @xmath115 .",
    "the challenging question is , can we present any limitations in terms of @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the domains of complete chaotic synchronization , as we could give for synchronized fixed points or periodic orbits ? certainly not in a strict way . since the tls , eqs .",

    "( [ zwev ] ) .",
    "yet , in the appendix , we develop an approximate form for a similar type of equations , which will allow us to specify limiting conditions for the domains of complete chaotic synchronization .",
    "a first guess of such a limiting condition can be obtained by means of a simple gedankenexperiment ( see fig .  [",

    "e.g. by means of a non - invasive control force @xmath119 proportional to the difference between their instantaneous signals complete synchronization can be achieved , and the delay systems show the same dynamics as if they were not influenced by the controller .",

    ", complete chaotic synchronization should occur more frequently , as long as the delay time does not exceed the limit of the chaotic instability .",
    "in fact , we observed complete synchronization of chaotic trajectories in our experiment for delay times far beyond the timescale of the uncoupled oscillators . this unexpected behavior could be attributed to the invasive character of our coupling scheme in the case of aperiodic trajectories .",
    "the coupling forces act like a virtual self - feedback , which has the tendency to reduce the grade of chaotic instability and to increase the lyapunov time . as a consequence complete chaotic synchronization",
    "could be achieved for very large delay times .",
    "we derived a general limitation for @xmath59 connecting the transversal stability with the longitudinal lyapunov exponent of the coupled chaotic systems .",
    "+ in spite of the simple and highly symmetric coupling scheme complete synchronization remains a rather exceptional phenomenon , which shows a very complex dependence on the coupling parameters .",
    "the complexity seems to be characteristic for systems with time delay and might result from the interplay of diverging tendencies : to complicate the system by inflating the dimension of phase space , or to simplify the system through the action of an invasive self - feedback .",
    "we were able to present general arguments excluding or limiting complete synchronization for different types of dynamics .",
    "however , the detailed mechanism of transversal stabilization is not yet fully understood and has certainly to include more detailed information on the phase rotation ( see @xcite ) and chaotic mixing of the components .",
    "further investigations based on a stochastic modeling of the chaotic drive might shed more light on this problem .",
    "starting from the tangent linear systems , eqs .",
    "( [ uvtls ] ) , we consider a small variation of the coupling strength @xmath16 without changing the driving trajectory @xmath106 , which is determined by eq .",
    "( [ zetaeq ] ) for some fixed value of @xmath16 .",
    "such a virtual step can be implemented only numerically , because in experiment - due to the invasive character of the coupling - any variation of @xmath16 would always influence @xmath106 . by analogy with the procedure for periodic orbits in  @xcite",
    "we introduce an approach for the lyapunov exponents in the sense of a linear expansion in @xmath16 around @xmath141 @xmath142 here @xmath136 depends only on the trajectory and is considered as a hidden intrinsic property . if @xmath143 were an unstable _ orbit _ of a single oscillator , @xmath136 would correspond to the real part of its floquet exponent in the absence of control .",
    "@xmath144 are expansion coefficients quantifying the _ coupling efficiencies _ of time - delayed and instantaneous terms , respectively .",
    "in general we have @xmath145 , which reflects the fact that for an aperiodic trajectory the delayed coupling term can not be mapped to the instantaneous term , as mentioned above .",
    "note that in contrast to the corresponding floquet problem @xcite eq .",
    "( [ lambdaeq ] ) holds for lyapunov exponents and - provided that @xmath16 remains sufficiently small - all involved parameters are real . in terms of such an approach",
    "we estimate the limits of transversal stability for a given longitudinal instability @xmath112 and delay time @xmath59 .",
    "we start from eq .",
    "( [ lambdaeq ] ) , which holds for both longitudinal and transversal dynamics @xmath146 note that the symmetry of the longitudinal and transversal lts results in identical expansion parameters @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath149 includes a variation of sign and strength of the transversal coupling with respect to the longitudinal coupling and can also be applied to more general schemes than considered here @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous terms in the coupling scheme can be easily included in the intrinsic lyapunov exponent through the renormalization @xmath150 .",
    "explicit solutions of these transcendental eqs . can be given in terms of the lambert w - function : @xmath151 the possibility of complete synchronization depends on the fact whether the global minimum of @xmath113 can become negative . for given @xmath152 the minimum is determined by the properties of the w - function and occurs at @xmath153 , i.e. , if @xmath16 takes such a value that @xmath154 we have @xmath155 and correspondingly , @xmath156 eliminating @xmath152 from both eqs .",

    "stable transversal dynamics only occurs for @xmath158 , which directly leads to a general limitation for the delay time : @xmath159 in our present coupling scheme we have @xmath160 , which results in the limiting condition @xmath161 ."
