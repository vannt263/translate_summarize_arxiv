    "this article is the third of a series of work on a new approach to the study of singularities of various objects in a local , two - dimensional setting .",
    "our focus in the present paper is on multiplier ideals and singularity exponents .    in the discussion below , we fix an equicharacteristic zero , two - dimensional regular local ring @xmath0 with algebraically closed residue field .",
    "an important example is the ring @xmath1 of holomorphic germs at the origin in @xmath2 .    in  @xcite",
    ", we introduced the space @xmath3 consisting of all @xmath4-valued valuations on @xmath5 centered at @xmath6 , and normalized by @xmath7 .",
    "this space is naturally a tree : it is a union of ( uncountably many ) real segments patched together in such a way that @xmath3 remains homotopic to a point .",
    "it is also an @xmath8-tree in the classical sense for a natural metric .",
    "we hence call @xmath3 the _ valuative tree_. it encodes in a natural way all possible blowups of @xmath5 centered at @xmath6 , and therefore gives a way of measuring quite precisely singularities of different kinds of objects",
    ". the points in @xmath3 that are not ends form the subtree @xmath9 of _ quasimonomial _ valuations .",
    "these valuations , which can alternatively be characterized as abhyankar valuations of rank 1 or as pushforwards of monomial valuations under birational morphisms , play a central role in our approach .",
    "we used the valuative tree to study singularities of ideals @xmath10 in  @xcite , and of plurisubharmonic ( psh ) functions @xmath11 in  @xcite ( in which case @xmath12 ) .",
    "we showed that @xmath13 and @xmath11 both give rise to functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 on @xmath9 , called the _ tree transforms _ of @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "these are defined as follows . for an ideal @xmath13 and @xmath16 , we set @xmath17 . for a psh function ,",
    "the definition of @xmath18 is more involved but can be interpreted either as a generalized lelong number in the sense of demailly or as the pushforward of a kiselman number under a birational morphism .",
    "it turns out that the tree transforms @xmath14 and @xmath15 enjoy strong concavity properties .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the closure of the cone generated by the functions on @xmath9 of the form @xmath20 over all @xmath21 and all ideals @xmath13 ( or equivalently by all @xmath15 s for psh functions @xmath11 ) . an element in @xmath22",
    "is called a _",
    "tree potential_. tree potentials can also be identified with positive measures on @xmath3 . in the case of an ideal ,",
    "the measure is atomic and its decomposition into atoms is equivalent to zariski s factorization of integrally closed ideals . in the case of a psh function",
    ", the measure determines the most important features of the singularity at the origin  a somewhat vague assertion that the paper at hand serves to substantiate .",
    "a general tree potential may be loosely viewed as a formal analogue of a psh function .",
    "multiplier ideals have emerged in recent years as a fundamental tool in algebraic and analytic geometry .",
    "we refer to the book  @xcite for a detailed account on this subject , on its range of applications , and for precise references .",
    "see also  @xcite for a more analytic point of view . here",
    "we contend ourselves with recalling a few definitions adapted to our setting .",
    "fix a psh function @xmath11 defined near the origin in @xmath2 .",
    "the multiplier ideal @xmath23 is the set of holomorphic germs @xmath24 such that @xmath25 is locally integrable .",
    "as @xmath11 may take the value @xmath26 , @xmath27 is in general strictly included in @xmath28 . to worse behavior of @xmath11 at @xmath29 ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath11 decreasing faster to @xmath26 , corresponds deeper ideals @xmath27 .",
    "the multiplier ideal hence measures , in some sense , the degree of singularity of @xmath11 .    to an ideal @xmath10 ( or more generally a formal power @xmath30 , @xmath21 )",
    "we can also associate a multiplier ideal @xmath31 .",
    "one way to do this uses resolution of singularities , whereas lipman  @xcite gives a more intrinsic definition .",
    "it is also possible to associate an asymptotic multiplier ideal to a graded system of ideals , i.e.  a sequence @xmath32 of ideals in @xmath5 such that @xmath33 .",
    "our first objective is to show that all these multiplier ideals can be analyzed in a unified way using tree potentials .",
    "more precisely , to any tree potential @xmath34 on @xmath9 we associate a multiplier ideal @xmath35 as follows : an element @xmath36 belongs to @xmath37 iff the function @xmath38 on @xmath9 is uniformly bounded by a constant @xmath39 .",
    "here @xmath40 is a function on @xmath9 called _",
    "thinness_. it contains information on the relative canonical divisor of suitable birational models of @xmath41 , as in the classical algebraic definition of multiplier ideals ( see section  [ s6 ] for details ) .",
    "we then show that the multiplier ideal of an ideal , a psh function , or a graded system of ideals , coincides with that of the corresponding tree transform .",
    "let us be more precise . if @xmath13 is an ideal and @xmath21",
    ", then we show that the multiplier ideal of @xmath30 coincides with that of the tree potential @xmath20 .",
    "our proof essentially consists of translating classical conditions for defining multiplier ideals into our language . in the case of a graded system of ideals",
    ", the condition @xmath33 implies a statement @xmath42 on the level of tree potentials ( @xmath43 is the tree potential of @xmath44 ) .",
    "as we show , the sequence @xmath45 converges to a tree potential @xmath34 whose multiplier ideal coincides with that of the graded system .",
    "similarly , we prove that if @xmath11 is psh , then the multiplier ideals @xmath46 and @xmath27 coincide .",
    "the proof is now more involved .",
    "we first use demailly s approximation technique to reduce to the case of a psh function with logarithmic singularities . the latter case",
    "is then reduced to the statement @xmath47 , proved earlier , for a suitable chosen ideal @xmath13 and @xmath21 .",
    "many of the arguments involved in the reductions draw from  @xcite , but our proof also depends heavily on the fact that the tree transform @xmath48 behaves well under demailly approximation .    apart from providing a unifying framework , tree potentials can be used as a powerful tool for studying many questions regarding multiplier ideals . as support",
    "to this claim , we give three applications of our approach .    the first two concern singularity exponents . to a general tree potential @xmath34",
    "is associated a number @xmath49 , called the _ singularity exponent _ or _ log - canonical threshold _ of @xmath34 .",
    "it is defined by @xmath50 .",
    "if @xmath51 is the tree transform of a psh function @xmath11 , then the singularity exponent is given by @xmath52 and is a number measuring the `` strength '' of the singularity of @xmath11 at the origin .",
    "various bounds were known for @xmath53 in terms of the lelong number  @xcite and kiselman numbers  @xcite of @xmath11 .",
    "we sharpen these bounds , and show that @xmath53 can be in fact computed explicitly in terms of all kiselman numbers of @xmath11 .",
    "we also prove that for @xmath54 , the function @xmath55 is _ never _ integrable .",
    "this provides an affirmative answer to the openness conjecture ( in dimension 2 ) by demailly and kollr ( see  ( * ? ? ? * remark  5.3 ) ) .",
    "in fact , we establish the more precise estimate @xmath56 as @xmath57 , and we improve a recent result by blel and mimouni  @xcite by proving that if @xmath11 has lelong number one , then @xmath58 fails to be locally integrable at the origin iff @xmath59 is the sum of the current of integration on a smooth curve and a current with zero lelong number .",
    "we then consider the set of complex singularity exponents @xmath60 when @xmath61 ranges over all holomorphic functions .",
    "shokurov  @xcite used mori s minimal program to show that @xmath62 satisfies the so - called _ ascending chain condition _ : any increasing sequence in @xmath62 is eventually stationary .",
    "kuwata  @xcite subsequently improved this result by characterizing explicitly all real numbers lying in @xmath62 .",
    "in 2000 , phong - sturm in  @xcite gave a completely analytic proof of this result .",
    "we present an algebraic proof in section  [ sec - acc ] , independent of both approaches above .",
    "it is conjectured ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3.5 ) ) that the ascending chain condition applies to set of complex singularity exponents in any dimension ( see  @xcite for the most recent result in this direction ) .",
    "we hope that our result might lead to further developments in higher dimension .    as a third application , we prove that any integrally closed ideal in @xmath5 is the multiplier ideal of some formal power of an ideal .",
    "this result was recently proved , independently , by lipman and watanabe  @xcite .",
    "finally we prove quite generally that a tree potential is completely characterized by the collection of multiplier ideals @xmath63 . as a consequence ,",
    "two psh functions @xmath11 and @xmath64 have identical multiplier ideals @xmath65 for all @xmath66 iff they are _ equisingular _ by which we mean that they have the same transforms @xmath67 .",
    "equisingularity may be geometrically interpreted as follows : for any composition @xmath68 of blowups , the lelong numbers of the pullbacks @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the same at any point on the exceptional divisor @xmath71 , see  ( * ? ? ? * proposition  6.2 ) .    since the results on singularity exponents for psh functions",
    "are arguably the most striking ones in the paper , we wish to briefly explain our approach , not using the language of valuations .",
    "fix a psh function @xmath11 and assume , for simplicity , that @xmath59 does not charge any curve . to any irreducible ( possibly singular ) curve @xmath72 at the origin and",
    "any real number @xmath73 we associate a family of punctured , conical neighborhood @xmath74 of diameter @xmath75 . here",
    "@xmath76 determines the `` thinness '' of the region .",
    "see figure  [ f2 ] on p .. we have @xmath77 for some @xmath78 , and in @xmath74 we have @xmath79 , for some ( maximal ) real number @xmath80 . if @xmath55 is locally integrable at the origin , it is integrable in @xmath74 , which easily implies @xmath81 .",
    "the crucial fact is the existence of an _ optimal _ region @xmath74 detecting integrability : for this region we have @xmath82 , which yields nonintegrability of @xmath83 , i.e.  the openness conjecture .",
    "moreover , the curve @xmath72 associated to this region is _ smooth _ , and then @xmath84 is a kiselman number of @xmath11 .",
    "it is to establish the existence and main properties of the optimal region @xmath85 that we bring valuations into the picture .",
    "in particular , the concavity properties of the tree transform of @xmath11 play a key role .",
    "most results presented here are probably not particular to dimension @xmath86 . the main difficulty in extending our approach to higher dimensions lies in understanding the analogue of the valuative tree .",
    "we hope to tackle this problem in future research .",
    "the present article relies in an essential way on the analysis and formalism in our previous work : we recall in section  [ s7 ] the main results of  @xcite ,  @xcite that will be used .",
    "the rest of the paper is then organized as follows : in section  [ sec - def ] we give the definition and main properties of multiplier ideals of tree potentials . as we show in sections  [ sec - ideal ] and  [ sec - psh ] , this notion naturally generalizes multiplier ideals of formal powers of ideals , graded system of ideals , and psh functions .",
    "sections  [ sec - arnold ] ,  [ sec - acc ] and  [ sec - asmult ] contain the applications mentioned above .",
    "we study equisingularity in section  [ sec - equi ] and end the paper with an appendix containing two proofs .",
    "in this section we give a brief review of the valuative tree and its applications to the study of ideals and plurisubharmonic ( psh ) functions . for details , we refer to  @xcite for sections  [ s13 ] to  [ s5 ] , and to  @xcite for section  [ s20 ] .      in general , @xmath0 denotes an equicharacteristic zero , two - dimensional regular local ring with algebraically closed residue field @xmath87 .",
    "we will refer to this as the _ general case_.    whenever we talk about psh functions , we will always be in the _ analytic case _ , meaning that @xmath1 is the ring of holomorphic germs at the origin in @xmath2 .",
