    "recent calculations with domain - wall qcd ( dwqcd ) have shown that the good chiral property of domain - wall fermions leads to good scaling behavior of physical observables such as quark mass and @xmath1@xcite . aside from the quenched approximation , the use of perturbative renormalization factors is the largest source of the uncontrolled systematic errors in these calculation .",
    "non - perturbative renormalization is required to reduce the total error to a few percent except for quenching , and we decide to employ the schrdinger functional(sf ) scheme@xcite , which is a gauge - invariant and finite volume method , toward this goal .    in this report",
    "we formulate the sf scheme for dwqcd and calculate the renormalization factors for vector and axial - vector currents as a first step to obtain the renormalization factors for the quark mass and @xmath1 .",
    "we consider dwqcd@xcite on an @xmath2 lattice .",
    "the sf boundary condition for the domain - wall fermion is given by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "here @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the boundary quark fields , @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    we follow the definitions and notations of ref .",
    "@xcite for the calculation of the renormalization factors .",
    "since the sf boundary condition in time for @xmath13 is identical to the shamir s domain - wall(dirichlet ) boundary condition in the fifth direction@xcite , extra zero modes appear near @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we check whether these unwanted zero modes induce extra contribution to the low energy observables at @xmath16 . here",
    "we consider the quark mass , @xmath17 , defined through the axial ward - takahashi identity(awti ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mawti ] , we plot @xmath18 for free theory as a function of @xmath19 with dirichlet , periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions at the bare quark mass @xmath20=0.01 , on an @xmath21 lattice , with the domain - wall height @xmath22=0.9 .",
    "= 6.8 cm    the dependence of @xmath17 on the boundary condition , which is visible near the boundaries , disappears away from them .",
    "therefore we conclude that the extra zero modes associated with the dirichlet boundary condition gives negligible effects to the determination of the renormalization factors evaluated at @xmath23 .",
    "further analytic investigations on this problem for the free case will be given elsewhere@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mq ] , @xmath18 for the sf scheme is plotted in quenched dwqcd at @xmath24 of the plaquette action .",
    "= 6.8 cm    the @xmath19 dependence is also weak away from the boundaries .",
    "interestingly @xmath25 is non - zero even at @xmath26 , and becomes smaller for larger @xmath27 .",
    "moreover the value is consistent with @xmath28 , the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry calculated from the conserved axial vector current of dwqcd@xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath25 for the sf scheme may be a better alternative as the measure of explicit chiral symmetry breaking in dwqcd , since it can be calculated directly at @xmath26 with much less computational cost .",
    "note also that the large explicit breaking in @xmath25 at @xmath29 ( open circles ) is well compensated if one takes a negative quark mass of @xmath30 ( filled circles ) .",
    "hence the domain - wall fermion at @xmath31 may be considered as a highly improved wilson fermion@xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative renormalization factors for vector and axial - vector currents are defined by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where we fix @xmath34 and put @xmath35 for @xmath36 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zva ] , @xmath37 and @xmath36 are plotted as a function of @xmath19 at @xmath24 .",
    "= 6.8 cm    similar to the case of @xmath18 a plateau is seen away from the boundaries .",
    "the relation @xmath38 , exactly valid in perturbation theory , is satisfied within 12% .",
    "moreover the magnitude almost agrees with the mean - field(mf ) improved one - loop value .",
    "we also observe that @xmath39 is insensitive to boundary parameters such as the 2-loop boundary counter - terms for gauge fields and the parameter @xmath40 of the twisted boundary condition for quarks .",
    "we have calculated @xmath37 and @xmath36 in quenched dwqcd at @xmath41 gev with the plaquette action ( @xmath24 ) and with the renormalization group(rg ) improved action ( @xmath42 ) on an @xmath43 lattice with @xmath26 for @xmath44 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] , where @xmath39 and @xmath36 are plotted as a function of @xmath22 , together with one - loop perturbative estimates with and without mf improvement .",
    "= 6.6 cm    = 6.6 cm    for both gauge actions , @xmath45 holds , and they show a minimum at @xmath46 for the plaquette action or @xmath47 for the rg action .",
    "perturbative estimates without mf improvement fail , particularly for the plaquette action for which the curve can not be placed in the figure .",
    "the agreement becomes much better with mf improvement for both actions .",
    "we are encouraged with the present results to proceed to an extension of the present work to scale - dependent cases such as quark masses and four - quark operators needed for @xmath1 .",
