    "meteorology has been both a seedbed and a testbed for many advances in the mathematics of complex systems ; the former being seen in its contribution of the lorenz model to nonlinear science ( lorenz 1963 ) , while the latter is exemplified by ensemble forecasting .",
    "this parallel evolution of theory and practise has identified important problems , e.g. , the need to model the effect of extra , _ noise - like _ , degrees of freedom on deterministic low dimensional dynamics .",
    "other well established paradigms such as hasselmann s stochastic model ( hasselmann 1976 ) , have highlighted the importance of _ red noise _ to mathematical climatology .    however , since the pioneering work of the late benoit mandelbrot , increasing attention is paid to two self - similar ( or  fractal \" ) aspects of time series : long - range dependence ( lrd ) in time , and the spatial counterpart of lrd , heavy tailed probability distributions in amplitude .",
    "first identified in hydrology , and since studied in research areas as diverse as biology , telecommunications , social networks , econometrics and the climate system , lrd is characterised by its low frequency singular behaviour , the so - called @xmath0 power spectrum .",
    "when present in a signal the correlations captured by lrd will both hamper the identification and the attribution of deterministic trends ( e.g. franzke 2010 ) , and impede the quantification of their significance .",
    "as was the case in the original context of hydrology , the presence of lrd in climate time series has been intensely debated , and it is still sometimes ascribed to transient effects , calibration issues or other forms of nonstationarity ( maraun et al .",
    "2004 , rust et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "lrd is also of practical significance . by making systems subject to longer - lived fluctuations ( beran 1994 ) it changes the information available to make predictions about the state of a complex system .",
    "it impacts the occurrence and clustering of extremes ( bunde et al .",
    "2005 , bogachev et al .",
    "2008 , kropp and schellnhuber 2010 ) which are important for risk assessments and mitigation strategies , e.g. insurance pricing and flood defence .",
    "the traditional assumption is that extremes are independent events .",
    "but there is growing evidence for clustering of extreme extra - tropical storms ( e.g. mailier et al .",
    "2006 ) and precipitation events ( e.g. 2007 united kingdom floods ) .",
    "this clustering of extremes will lead to higher return periods of extreme events than the more common assumption of independence .",
    "recently , detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , a tool originally developed to detect lrd , has found application in the prediction of dangerous bifurcations in dynamical systems such as climate  tipping points \" ( livina and lenton 2007 , lenton et al . 2011 , sieber and thompson 2011 ) .",
    "our contribution to this volume is focused both on i ) the problem of accurately estimating lrd in the presence of other signal elements , and ii ) the complicating effects of heavy - tailed amplitude distributions , when they are present .",
    "a process is long range dependent when the prediction of its next state depends on the whole of its past .",
    "an imprint of this dependence structure is that the covariance @xmath1 decays slowly , as@xmath2 , so that @xmath3 this slow decay of the covariances means that the values of the process _",
    "x _ are strongly dependent over long periods of time .",
    "this contrasts with the more familiar short - range dependent system where @xmath4 . in a short - range dependent process",
    "the next state only depends on the current state and the recent past .",
    "the archetype of a short - range dependent process is a first order markov process where the next state depends only on the present state and is conditionally independent of past states .",
    "see beran ( 1994 ) for more details .",
    "long - range dependence of a system is characterised by the parameter @xmath5 in the statistics literature and sometimes by mandelbrot s joseph parameter @xmath6 , for example in the physics literature .",
    "temporal long - range dependence has been detected in the water level of the river nile ( hurst 1951 , hurst et al .",
    "it was observed that the range of values grows as @xmath7 , where @xmath6 refers to the joseph exponent ( e.g. mandelbrot 2001 , p. 157 ) and @xmath8 to the time period under consideration .",
    "the growth of range was anomalously large compared to that in the familiar paradigms of random walks and brownian motion , which have both played a central role in understanding diffusion . in the random",
    "walk , the variance grows as the square root of time @xmath9 ( einstein 1905 ) .",
    "the subsequent theoretical explanation of the difference between the observed anomalous diffusion and the brownian motion paradigm came first through the use of a self - similar process , in particular via the study of fractional brownian motion ( fbm ; mandelbrot & wallis 1968 ) . here",
    ", self - similarity means that the statistical properties on all scales are similar .",
    "this property is controlled by the self - similarity parameter @xmath10 .",
    "a stochastic process @xmath11 is self - similar when a rescaling of time by a factor @xmath12 leads to a rescaling of the amplitude of the process @xmath11 by @xmath13 .",
    "thus , a process is said to be @xmath10-self - similar when the following relation holds ( embrechts and maejima 2002 ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes equality in distribution .",
    "it is not always appreciated , and is sometimes confused in the literature , that two different aspects of a time series can contribute to its self - similarity @xmath10 .",
    "the first is lrd , which is synonymous with persistence , referred to by mandelbrot and wallis ( 1968 ) as the _ joseph _ effect .",
    "persistent systems exhibit longevity by having a tendency to maintain the way they have been recently .",
    "examples are heat waves and drought conditions .",
    "the second source of self - similarity identified by mandelbrot , the so - called _ noah _ effect is the property that change in a system can be rather large and can occur very abruptly i.e. time series drawn from systems can exhibit sharp discontinuities , e.g. , earth quakes .",
    "it may at first seem odd that both phenomena occur simultaneously in natural systems because they pull in opposite directions . on reflection ,",
    "taken together , however , we see that the two effects capture the facts that coherent structures in nature are real and that they can emerge , change or even vanish very quickly .",
    "the archetypal model of the noah effect is non - gaussian jumps whose complementary cumulative distribution function decays with a power law in size @xmath16 , @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 denotes the stability exponent ( referred to as tail exponent in the statistics literature ) .",
    "thus , the self - similarity parameter is @xmath19 the distinction between @xmath10 and @xmath20 is important because not all observed time series have gaussian fluctuations . as such one may find that popular diagnostics , as shown below , may be insensitive to heavy tails , measuring j and not h. however , in many situations both heavy tails and the clustering of extremes caused by lrd are very important and both contribute to the value of h. this makes it necessary to be able to measure both h and j independently .",
    "many estimators for the lrd exponent @xmath5 have thus been developed , and are widely used in the respective literatures .",
    "much of what has been rigorously established about the estimators , however , is for a particular lrd gaussian model : fbm , which is also @xmath10 self - similar and has a particularly simple relation between @xmath10 and @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath21 ( @xmath22 for gaussian increments ) .",
    "most observed time series depart from the assumptions of fbm in some way or another , so it is important to critically evaluate how sensitive the estimators are to deviations from fractional gaussian noise ( fgn ) .",
    "fbm is a random walk with long - range correlated increments and the value of @xmath6 in such @xmath10-self - similar walks is directly connected to the presence of lrd in their increments .    in this study",
    "we critically re - evaluate 4 popular methods for measuring @xmath5 and two for measuring @xmath10 : variable bandwidth estimator ( schmittbuhl et al .",
    "1995 ) and wavelets ( wl ; stoev and taqqu 1995 ) , detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ; peng et al . 1994 ) , the re - scaled range analysis ( @xmath23 ; hurst 1951 , mandelbrot 2001 ) , exact whittle estimator ( shimotsu and phillips 2005 , 2006 ) and semi - parametric estimators ( in this study we will focus on the geweke - porter - hudak ( gph ) estimator ; geweke & porter - hudak 1983 ; semi - parametric estimators are also described in bardet et al .",
    "1998 , robinson 1995a , 1995b , hurvich et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this is a not a complete set of estimators for the self - similarity or long - range dependence parameter ( other estimators , which are well established in the statistics community include fexp ( hurvich et al .",
    "2002 ) ) . here",
    "we want to focus on some of the most popular estimators in the physics and geosciences communities ( @xmath23 : tuck and hovde 1999 , price and newman 2001 , ogurtsov , 2004 , scipioni et al , 2008 , ghil et al .",

    "2005 ) .",
    "we show scatter plots which compare the imposed parameters for a number of trials with the values detected by the above methods .",
    "these have the advantage of visually indicating which methods measure the complete self - similarity exponent @xmath10 , and which , instead , measure long range dependence via @xmath5 . for evaluating the performance of these estimators we employ 2 well - established paradigmatic time series models : a self - similar process ( linear fractional stable motion ( lfsm ) ; samorodnitsky & taqqu 1994 ) and an asymptotically self - similar process ( autoregressive fractional integrated moving average ( arfima ) ; e.g. beran 1994 ) .    in most natural systems trends",
    "are common properties , so we systematically examine the performance of the various estimators when a linear trend is superposed on each time series . this is an important issue because in practice it is not always easy to remove trends . that they typically manifest themselves in higher moments presents further challenges still .",
    "trends are the hardest to deal with because long - range dependent processes can produce apparent trends over rather long periods of time ( e.g. franzke 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , it can be difficult to decide if a trend is due to external forcing or due to finite time series length .",
    "in section 2 we present the two paradigmatic time series models in more detail and discuss various special cases . in section 3",
    "we introduce the estimators of long - range dependence and self - similarity .",
    "we test their utility in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss the lrd and self - similarity properties of two exemplary time series from nature and in section 6 we provide conclusions .",

    "c ) auroral electrojet index from january through june 2006 in nanotesla and d ) probability density function of the auroral electrojet index . ]",
    "the most prominent and widely used paradigmatic lrd time series model , especially in the physics literature , is fgn .",
    "however , most natural time series are not strictly gaussian and many are actually highly non - gaussian .",
    "to illustrate this point we discuss two time series from nature . in fig .",
    "[ faradayae]a we display monthly mean temperature from the antarctic station faraday - vernadsky ( turner et al .",
    "2004 , franzke 2010 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the raw time series is highly non - gaussian .",
    "this is confirmed by the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) plotted in fig .",
    "[ faradayae]b .",
    "there is also a striking seasonal signal visible in the skewness of the pdfs .",
    "however , it must to be noted that polar temperature time series are much more non - gaussian than mid - latitude ones which are typically nearly gaussian .",
    "our second exemplary time series is the auroral electrojet ( ae ) index ( fig .",
    "[ faradayae ] , e.g. , davis & sugiura 1966 , watkins 2002 ) .",
    "the ae index is derived from 1 minute resolution time series from 12 high latitude magnetometers . reflecting the intermittent nature of the ionospheric and solar wind processes which influence it ,",
    "the ae index is seen to be spiky and strongly non - gaussian ( fig . [ faradayae]d ) .",
    "clearly , many natural time series are non - gaussian .      while fgn and fbm are gaussian , they are still useful idealised paradigmatic models for understanding many observed phenomena .",
    "a paradigmatic model is an idealised framework which captures some properties of observed time series , though not all .",
    "most paradigmatic models allow analytical work , although at the expense of an over - idealisation of the physical or biological phenomena .",
    "there is a need for better paradigmatic models of observed phenomena which allow simultaneously non - gaussian statistics and lrd .",
    "such models are needed e.g. , for hypothesis testing and time series simulation .",
    "thus , we briefly discuss two paradigmatic time series models which exhibit lrd and non - gaussianity .",
    "the widely used fgn and fbm are special cases in the gaussian limit of these more general models , thereby retaining some of the analytical tractability of these models .    in this study",
    "we use two classes of processes with symmetric@xmath25-stable ( s@xmath26s ) distributions .",
    "they are the lfsm and the arfima model with s@xmath27s innovations .",
    "stoev and taqqu ( 2004 ) present efficient methods for the simulation of these processes using the fast fourier transform .",
    "lfsm is a model which exhibits lrd and heavy tails at the same time .",
    "it is an extension to the simpler brownian random walk model .",
    "it links individual heavy tailed jumps by means of a retarded memory kernel .",
    "it can be represented by a stochastic process@xmath28 , has been defined in ( [ eq:1 ] ) as the dependent and @xmath5 and @xmath18 as the independent variables . ] which is defined by the following stochastic integral @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and where @xmath32 is a standard symmetric @xmath27-stable ( s@xmath26s ) levy process .",
    "the process @xmath33 is called lfsm and is self - similar with self - similarity parameter h. thus , it satisfies relation ( [ eq : selfsim ] ) and has stationary increments .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 controls the tails of the distribution of an s@xmath26s random variable @xmath35 , that is , @xmath36 the greater the value of@xmath37 , the lower the probability of extreme fluctuations of the s@xmath26s process@xmath38 .",
    "we recommend the introductions by taqqu ( 2003 ) and mercik et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for detailed expositions .      in the gaussian case we have that @xmath39 and the lfsm process ( [ eq : stoch ] ) reduces to fbm .",
    "in this case the self - similarity parameter @xmath10 will always equal the joseph exponent @xmath6 , thus , @xmath40 .      in the memory - less case we have @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "in this case equation ( [ eq : tails ] ) holds and the tails of the distribution decay according to a power - law and consequently @xmath43 has infinite variance and is called ordinary lvy motion .",
    "this encapsulates the noah effect . in this case",
    "the self - similarity exponent is @xmath44 .",
    "another paradigmatic model exhibiting lrd with heavy - tailed fluctuations is arfima , which has the added ability of exhibiting short - range dependent behaviour .",
    "this model , denoted arfima(_p , d , q _ ) , @xmath45 , extends the usual autoregressive integrated moving average arima(_p , d , q _ ) models , in which @xmath5 takes integer values ( box & jenkins 1970 ) .",
    "an arima model is written as : @xmath46 where _ b _ denotes the back shift operator defined by @xmath47,@xmath48 ... the polynomials @xmath49 and @xmath50 are defined as @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where _ p _ and _ q _ are integers . the innovations @xmath53 are usually independent and identically distributed ( iid ) normal variables with zero expectation and variance @xmath54 , but can also be @xmath18-stable distributed .",
    "the widely used autoregressive process of first order ( ar(1 ) ) is a special case with @xmath55 , @xmath41 and @xmath56 .",
    "typically @xmath5 is an integer . in the case that @xmath5 is a fractional real number , _",
    "x(t ) _ is an arfima(_p , d , q _ ) process with @xmath57 and exhibits lrd . in the gaussian case arfima",
    "is stationary .",
    "an arfima @xmath58 is asymptotically equivalent to fbm ( taqqu 2003 ) .",
    "an arfima@xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 is long - range dependent but not self - similar .",
    "however , it is asymptotically self - similar for long time scales .",
    "here we briefly describe the four estimators of the self - similarity and lrd parameters used in this study .",
    "the variable bandwidth ( @xmath24 ) method ( schmittbuhl et al . 1995 ) is a technique for estimating the self - similarity exponent , @xmath10 , from a time series @xmath62 .",
    "the time series of length @xmath63 is divided into windows or ` bands ' of width @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath24 method can deploy two different algorithms to estimate @xmath10 .",
    "( i ) the standard deviation of the time series , @xmath65 , is computed in each band ; or ( ii ) the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each band , @xmath66 , is computed .",
    "then @xmath65 and @xmath66 are averaged over all the possible bands by varying the origin at fixed @xmath64 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of windows of length @xmath64 .",
    "this is repeated over a range of window sizes .",
    "both quantities follow a power - law behaviour for self - similar time series ( schmittbuhl et al .",
    "1995 ) such that @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the self - similarity exponent , @xmath10 , is obtained from the slope of the corresponding log - log plot .",
    "a wavelet @xmath71 is a function with zero average and is normalised to one .",
    "a family of wavelets is generated by scaling @xmath71 by a factor @xmath16 and translating it by @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the wavelet transform allows to construct a time - frequency representation of a signal , the wavelet spectrum .",
    "one can then infer the self - similarity parameter from the wavelet spectrum via ordinary least squares at large wavelet scales ( abry and veitch 1998 , stoev and taqqu 2005 ) .",
    "the rescaled range @xmath23 ( hurst 1965 ) is a technique for estimating the lrd parameter @xmath5 from a time series .",
    "the @xmath23 estimator is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "it scales like @xmath7 where the value of @xmath6 can be estimated from the slope of @xmath23 from a log - log plot .      detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ; peng et al .",
    "1994 ) also estimates the lrd parameter @xmath5 from a time series . in dfa ,",
    "a profile is first computed by @xmath78 .",
    "the profile is cut into @xmath79 non - overlapping segments of equal length@xmath80 and then the local trend is subtracted for each segment @xmath81 by a polynomial least - squares fit of the data .",
    "linear ( dfa1 ) , quadratic ( dfa2 ) , cubic ( dfa3 ) or higher order polynomials can be used for detrending . in the @xmath82 order dfa ,",
    "trends of order @xmath83 in the profile , and of order @xmath84 in the original record , are eliminated .",
    "next the variance for each of the@xmath85 segments is calculated by averaging over all data points@xmath86 in the@xmath87 segment : @xmath88.\\ ] ] finally , the average over all segments is computed and the square root is applied to obtain the following _ fluctuation function _ @xmath89 for different detrending orders , @xmath83 , we obtain different fluctuation functions @xmath90 , which are denoted by @xmath91 .",
    "the fluctuation function scales according to @xmath92 , with @xmath93 .",
    "there are many variants of dfa , but use of standard dfa is recommended by basahn et al .",
    "( 2008 ) if the functional form of a trend is not a priori known .",
    "the exact whittle estimator is a semi - parametric estimator ( shimotsu and phillips 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "this method assumes that the underlying model of lrd can be represented by @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is iid noise .",
    "see shimotsu and phillips ( 2005 , 2006 ) for more details .      as a semi - parametric estimator",
    "we use the power spectral method of geweke & porter - hudak ( 1983 ) and hurvich et al .",
    "spectral methods find @xmath5 by estimating the spectral slope .",
    "the periodogram is used , which is an estimate of the spectral density of a finite - length time series and is given by : @xmath96,\\ ] ] where@xmath97 is the frequency and the square brackets denote rounding towards zero . a series with lrd",
    "has a spectral density proportional to @xmath98 close to the origin .",
    "since @xmath99 is an estimator of the spectral density , @xmath5 is estimated by a regression of the logarithm of the periodogram versus the logarithm of the frequency @xmath100 .",
    "thus having calculated the spectral density estimate @xmath99 , semi - parametric estimators fit a power law of the form @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the scaling factor .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "there is also evidence for long - range dependence in the ae index , again with a wide variety of estimates from the various estimators : whittle @xmath103 , gph @xmath104 , dfa2 @xmath105 , @xmath23 @xmath106 , wavelet @xmath107 , @xmath108 @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xmath111 .",
    "the estimates from gph and dfa2 are larger than 0.5 , suggesting a non - stationary time series , while the whittle and @xmath23 estimates suggests a stationary long - range dependent time series .",
    "again the @xmath10 estimates are larger than the @xmath5 estimates , providing some evidence for self - similarity .",
    "other evidence has been presented that ae may not be a simple fractal ( consolini et al .",
    "1996 ) ; recently work has focused on high - frequency non - stationary and lower - frequency @xmath0 properties ( rypdal and rypdal 2010 ) .    while all lrd estimators agree that there is evidence for lrd in these two time series they provide a rather large range of possible values , illustrating the problem of statistically robust lrd estimation in practice and the need for further investigation of the performance of statistical indicators in the presence of departures from fractality , including possible multifractality .",
    "there are two contributions to self - similarity : ( i ) long - range dependence and ( ii ) non - gaussian jumps .",
    "this is not always appreciated in the various communities with interests in detecting self - similarity and long - range dependence .",
    "we have shown that empirical estimators of long - range dependence are at best biased for fractional gaussian noise , but at worst not robust for processes which deviate from this idealised model .",
    "we have also shown that the empirical estimators are not very robust in the presence of trends and multiplicative noise .",
    "our results have several important implications for the modelling of natural time series . in our view the arfima model is a much better paradigmatic model of natural time series than fgn since it allows one to explicitly model short - range and long - range behaviour while also allowing for non - gaussian increments .    finally , there is a need for estimation procedures which can deal with multiplicative noise and trends in the variance .",
    "such effects introduce sizeable biases and estimation uncertainty . as such , all estimations of lrd",
    "have to be taken with precaution . while it is true that all of the estimators we tested perform reasonably well for fractional gaussian noise , once a time series is non - gaussian or is non - stationary ( in trend or volatility ) the estimators can be problematic .",
