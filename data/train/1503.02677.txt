    "phys : did you hear about the mystery of the ishango bone found in congo by prof .",
    "j. de heinzelin ?",
    "you can see it pictured as fig .",
    "math : yes , this is the oldest known mathematical puzzle , it dates back at least @xmath0 years .",
    "the bone carries groups of notches totalizing @xmath1 in left and right columns and @xmath2 in the center column .",
    "a friend of mine found a good explanation of the puzzle , the ancient african of ishango happened to use the base @xmath3 for counting @xcite .",
    "phys : why 12 ?    math : at that time , african used the thumb of a hand to count the bones in the fingers of their hands .",
    "four fingers times three little bones on a hand yield @xmath3 as a counting unit . as there are 24 little bones in the two hands one gets : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "phys : what are these strange symbols @xmath6 and @xmath7 ? in quantum physics , @xmath8 denotes the wave function in space time but some scientists doubt its reality , it leads to many paradoxes such as schrdinger s cat that may be simultaneously dead or alive .",
    "one finally introduced the qubit concept @xmath9 to model the superposition , but problems arise with two qubits or more with such strange phenomena as non - locality and the non - reality of objects prior to measurements , a phenomenon called contextuality .",
    "math : in number theory , @xmath10 may designate the second chebyshev function , a very important concept for looking accurately at the distribution of prime numbers .",
    "but i refer to the dedekind psi function @xmath11 , where the product is over the primes @xmath12 that divide @xmath13 . at square free numbers @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 equals the sum of divisor function @xmath15 .",
    "there are papers showing that both functions simultaneously arise for counting the number of maximal commuting sets of a @xmath13-level quantum system @xcite .",
    "phys : you are right .",
    "the ( general ) pauli group for a qudit- a @xmath13-level system- is generated by two operators @xmath16 ( shift ) and @xmath17 ( clock ) as @xmath18 ( generalizing the case of the two - qubit pauli group when @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the standard pauli spin matrices ) .",
    "the operators in @xmath19 are organized into @xmath15 maximal commuting sets ( mcs ) of size @xmath20 , where @xmath21 of them are admissible. a non - admissible mcs turns out to be transversal to every admissible mcs and can be removed .",
    "the geometry of admissible mcs is the projective line @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the ring of integers @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "you can easily observe how much different a @xmath26-level system is from a @xmath27-qubit system .",
    "a @xmath27-qubit system comprises @xmath28 operators and @xmath28 mcs organized as the smallest thick generalized quadrangle @xmath29 while a @xmath26-level system has the same number of operators but only @xmath30 mcs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  1 ) .",
    "math : both arithmetic functions @xmath10 and @xmath14 can be used to formulate the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) about the critical zeros of the riemann zeta @xmath31 . as for the dedekind @xmath32 , it was first introduced as the index of a particular congruence subgroup @xmath33 of the modular group @xmath34 .",
    "congruence subgroups @xmath35 , for @xmath12 prime , are used for defining genus zero surfaces if @xmath36 divides @xmath37 .",
    "the relation to rh is as follows .",
    "taking the ratio @xmath38 , it has been shown that the statement @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is euler constant ) is equivalent to rh @xcite . as for @xmath10 ,",
    "i know that the logarithmic integral @xmath41 $ ] does much better than @xmath42 for counting the number of primes . here",
    "the statement @xmath41-\\pi(x)$ ] is equivalent to rh @xcite .",
    "phys : impressive !",
    "i am interested in advanced maths for clarifying problems in physics .",
    "i like wolfgang pauli quote _ there is no god and dirac is his prophet _",
    "do you think that god is a mathematician or , like alfred jarry , that _",
    "god is the tangential point between zero and infinity _ ?",
    "@xcite . it is a bit provocative , is nt it ?",
    "so , the number @xmath37 occurs in the prime groups @xmath35 , as it occurs in the explanation of the tracks in the ishango bone .",
    "it is quite remarkable that a hot topic of physics -quantum entanglement- also relates to @xmath37 .",
    "the group of automorphisms of euclidean dense lattices such as the root lattices @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the barnes - wall lattice bw@xmath45 , the unimodular lattice @xmath46 and the leech lattice @xmath47 may be generated by entangled quantum gates of the corresponding dimension , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the leech lattice is the densest known lattice in dimension @xmath37 .",
    "it has the kissing number @xmath48 and automorphism group @xmath49 , where the sporadic conway group @xmath50 has order about @xmath51 .",
    "math : but the story is not finished , the group you mention is a sporadic part of the largest finite group , the monster group @xmath52 of cardinality @xmath53 -this would correspond to the mass in kg of the known universe . now if you add to @xmath54 ( @xmath13 square free ) the fricke involution matrix @xmath55 you get another group with a single cusp at @xmath56 called @xmath57 . for prime @xmath58 , the group has genus zero if and only if @xmath12 is in the sequence @xmath59 occurring in the factors of @xmath60 .",
    "this coincidence is again a puzzle when it is rewritten as @xmath61 and so on , in which the numbers at the left column occur in the @xmath62-expansion of the modular @xmath63-invariant ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the upper - half plane ) and the numbers at the right column are sums of dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations of the monster @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the coincidence is known as the monstrous moonshine ( in the sense of being a crazy idea ) .",
    "i quote the field medalist richard borcherds after his proof of the puzzle with the help of string theoretical concepts : _ i sometimes wonder if this is the feeling you get when you take certain drugs .",
    "i do nt actually know , as i have not tested this theory of mine _",
    "this is an illustration of the pre - established harmony between maths and physics .",
    "concerning jarry s quote , i have put labels @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath56 on ubu s portrait in fig .",
    "1b in order to illustrate a salient feature of grothendieck s dessins denfants @xcite , another way to approach the moonshine subject .",
    "phys : thanks , may be this approach helps to clarify the @xmath7-quantum puzzle .",
    "let us discuss this point tomorrow .",
    "phys : look at what i see as the simplest @xmath7-quantum diagram of all , a square graph ( shown in fig .",
    "2a ) that is the paragon of two - qubit bell s theorem about non - locality ( * ? ? ?",
    "imagine that alice and bob are spatially separated and do electron spin measurements ( along the orthogonal directions @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) with their stern - gerlach .",
    "the four ( two - qubit ) operators involved are denoted @xmath70 , @xmath71 as shown in my picture ( a ) where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the pauli spin matrices and a notation such as @xmath74 means the tensorial product of the identity matrix @xmath75 and the pauli matrix @xmath16 .",
    "there is an edge between two vertices if they commute . as the result of a measurement",
    "can only be the eigenvalue @xmath76 of a @xmath70 , one expects to satisfy the inequality @xmath77 but the calculations with the operators @xmath70 lead to the norm @xmath78 instead of @xmath27 , and the experiments confirm this fact .",
    "there are many choices for a square graph with multiple qudits @xmath70 and the result is always a maximal violation @xmath79 .",
    "math : do you have an explanation of the algebraic equation @xmath80 ?     of the square .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]  of the square . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    phys : one can not escape the quantum formalism on this matter .",
    "observe that there is none commuting entangled pair @xmath81 in my example , the proof of bell s theorem does not refer to entanglement .",
    "but i found another argument based on the permutation group @xmath82 with the two generators @xmath83 and @xmath84 , this is pictured in my fig .",
    "2b where @xmath85 means @xmath70 .",
    "each edge of my drawing corresponds to the same stabilizer subgroup of @xmath86 .",
    "math : your graph is a grothendieck s dessin denfant and the generators mean how you go around the black and white vertices , is nt it ?",
    "and i see that the vertices live in the extension field @xmath87 .",
    "this means that your dessin can also be seen as a complex algebraic curve over the field of algebraic numbers .",
    "congratulations , this is a nice use of a quite sophisticated mathematical trick . is your graph ( b ) the only choice to stabilize the square ?",
    "phys : you are right , there are essentially four choices as shown in fig . 1 of the article @xcite .",
    "i kept the most asymmetric graph because i have the vague feeling that , as einstein wrote : _ everything should be made as simple as possible , but not simpler _ @xcite .",
    "the three other choices are too symmetric , i feel one needs some breaking of the symmetry to allow a deeper explanation of bell s theorem .",
    "i suspect that mathematics can help .",
    "math : you know , i met your dessin before .",
    "it corresponds to one ( the case i ) of the non - normal inclusions of triangle groups classified by d. singerman @xcite .",
    "the monodromy permutation @xmath86 that you introduced is the subcover @xmath88 of the famous klein quartic @xmath89 .",
    "the triangle groups corresponding to the modular curves @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the congruence subgroup @xmath92 and the smallest moonshine group @xmath93 that we discussed yesterday .",
    "i suspect that your bell s theorem is an elementary stone of a modular physical theory based on the monster @xmath52 , a kind of atom .",
    "this reminds me the vortex atoms of lord kelvin .",
    "the modern language is knot theory and witten developed his topological quantum field theory based on this set of ideas .",
    "even more intriguing , the moonshine group @xmath93 is related to the baby monster group @xmath94 of order @xmath95 through another puzzling series @xcite @xmath96 and so on , where the numbers @xmath97 correspond to the @xmath62-expansion of the main modular invariant @xmath98 ( also called a hauptmodul ) for @xmath93 and the numbers @xmath99 are all dimensions of smallest irreducible representations of @xmath94 .",
    "one has the property : @xmath100 as for the @xmath62-expansion of @xmath101 and that of the modular discriminant @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "that moonshine for @xmath94 relates to bell s theorem is a remarkable coincidence !",
    "phys : the approach is the application of a simple axiomatic with only two letters @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "mathematically , my language is also called a free group @xmath105 .",
    "elements in the group are words @xmath106 , any combination @xmath107 ( the neutral element ) is annihilated and i also write that @xmath104 is an involution that is , @xmath108 .        the relative size of a subgroup @xmath109 of @xmath110",
    "is called the index which means that there are @xmath111 inequivalent copies ( called cosets ) of @xmath109 that fill up @xmath110 .",
    "the action of generators on these cosets creates the permutation group @xmath86 by the todd - coxeter algorithm .",
    "you can name the cosets by a word representative , the other elements in the coset are conjugate to the representative .",
    "i did it in fig .",
    "3 for the case just discussed where the index is @xmath26 .    with a little effort , you can check that pairs of cosets on a edge are commuting in the group sense that is , the commutator @xmath112 . in this special case , coset commutation respects quantum commutation .",
    "but i can show that it is not always the case for a geometry stabilized by a higher index group .",
    "following gottlob frege quote : _ never ask for the meaning of a word in isolation , but only in the context of a sentence _ @xcite .    . the pictures have coordinates in the @xmath110-set @xmath113 with the corresponding cosets shown on ( a ) and a set of @xmath114-qubit operators shown on ( b).,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ] . the pictures have coordinates in the @xmath110-set @xmath113 with the corresponding cosets shown on ( a ) and a set of @xmath114-qubit operators shown on ( b).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    look at mermin s pentagram shown on fig .",
    "4b @xcite , i labeled the vertices from @xmath67 to @xmath115 and with @xmath114-qubit coordinates .",
    "the product of operators on a thin line is @xmath116 and @xmath117 on a thick line so that , as shown by david mermin , this pentagram is a contextuality proof @xcite .",
    "remember that i was able to stabilize a square with the permutation group ( i.e. the dessin denfant ) shown in fig .",
    "2b . with the same reasoning ,",
    "i stabilize the pentagram with a permutation group @xmath86 generated by the permutations @xmath118 and @xmath119 as shown in fig .",
    "each point on a selected line of the pentagram corresponds to the same stabilizer subgroup @xmath120 of @xmath86 ( all the @xmath120 are isomorphic but they act on different sets of points ) . then in fig .",
    "3b , i have put the coset representatives for labeling the edges . in this way you can check that on a thick line of the pentagram not all cosets are commuting .",
    "of course the cosets on a ( thin ) line containing the identity element @xmath121 are commuting .",
    "i call a geometry contextual when it happens that at least a line fails to have its points / cosets commuting . in this way ,",
    "geometric contextuality reflects quantum contextuality @xcite .",
    "math : you did nt comment on your fig .",
    "4c but i recognize the tiling of a fundamental domain in the upper - half plane @xmath122 .",
    "i see that the tiles of @xmath122 reflect the edge ( coset ) structure of your dessin and , of course , the tiles also correspond to your three - qubit operators .",
    "phys : yes , the modular representation of the pentagram is in the spirit of what you explained yesterday . as the generators @xmath123 and @xmath124 have order three and two respectively , they build a subgroup @xmath125 of the modular group @xmath126 that is a congruence subgroup of level @xmath127 .",
    "the set of cusps for @xmath125 consists of the @xmath125-orbits of @xmath128 , cusps are at @xmath129 and @xmath56 and they have width @xmath114 .",
    "my @xmath125 is of type @xmath130 in cummins - pauli classification ( http://www.uncg.edu/mat/faculty/pauli/congruence/congruence.html ) .",
    "i used the software sage to draw the fundamental domain of @xmath125 thanks to the farey symbol methodology .",
    "i am not the first to play with sage on modular aspects of dessins , you can read the essay by lieven le bruyn @xcite .",
    "math : if your approach makes sense , you should also encounter other moonshine groups , did you ?",
    "phys : it is true that moonshine groups relate to geometric contextuality",
    ". there exists six congruence subgroups of the modular group @xmath126 that are simultaneously torsion free , of genus @xmath66 and index @xmath3 and three of them have a moonshine group as their normalizer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 5 ) .",
    "the corresponding dessins can be seen in ( * ? ? ?",
    "look at the results in my table 1 : the normalizer of @xmath131 is @xmath126 and three extra congruence subgroups have the normalizer @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",

    "cols=\"<,^,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     math : excellent , the next step would be to compute the modular symbols , the relative homology of the extended upper half plane and the corresponding modular forms of weight two and higher .",
    "i am curious to see if the noncongruence cusp forms for these sporadic polygons have unbounded denominators , as conjectured @xcite .",
    "you are close to the philosophy of cusp forms of harish - chandra .",
    "he was studying under dirac himself but turned to mathematics when he learned in princeton that _ not every function is analytic _",
    "the keyword for the link between moonshine and the langlands program is voa ( for vertex operator algebra ) .",
    "the monster vertex algebra is conjectured ( by e. frenkel and collaborators ) to be the unique holomorphic voa with charge @xmath37 and partition function @xmath135 ( where @xmath63 is again the modular invariant ) .",
    "i quote e. frenkel @xcite : _ mathematics is not about studying boring and useless equations : it is about accessing a new way of thinking and understanding reality at a deeper level .",
    "it endows us with an extra sense and enables humanity to keep pushing the boundaries of the unknown .",
    "_    i suggest that you look at a promising line of moonshine research by i. frenkel ( not e. frenkel ) and j. dunkan @xcite based on the use of a rademacher sum for the modular invariant @xmath136 , with @xmath64 as @xmath137 with @xmath138 relative integers and @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "the authors show that the mckay - thomson series @xmath141 of an element @xmath142 coincides with a generalized rademacher sum .",
    "they expect to get a version of the simplest chiral @xmath143 quantum gravity with @xmath37 charges , as the original construction of the chiral @xmath144 conformal field theory by mckay based on the partition function @xmath101 .",
    "phys : i am familiar with rademacher work .",
    "some time ago , i investigated the thermodynamics of the euler gas whose partition function is that of the number of unrestricted partitions @xmath145 .",
    "this was useful to model the low frequency fluctuations ( of the @xmath146 type ) occurring in a gaz of bosons , like the phonons in a quartz crystal resonator @xcite .",
    "the mathematics involves the hardy - ramanujan circle method in analytic number theory and this was improved by rademacher .",
    "math : do you think that our mathematics is the real world ?",
    "phys : as a provisional response , i offer you a quote of stephen hawking from his lecture godel and the end of the universe \" @xcite : _ in the standard positivist approach to the philosophy of science , physical theories live rent free in a platonic heaven of ideal mathematical models ... but we are not angels , who view the universe from the outside . instead",
