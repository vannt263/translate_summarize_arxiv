    "with the advent of the fermi / lat , more than one hundred new gamma - ray pulsars have been detected @xcite .",
    "their spectral properties rule out a polar cap scenario for pulsed high - energy emission because the cut - off frequency about a few gev is only exponential and not super - exponential as predicted by these models  @xcite .",
    "this favours emission sites in the outer part of the magnetosphere or even outside the light - cylinder .",
    "however , with our current knowledge relying mostly on phase - resolved spectra , it is impossible to go further and eliminate some of the remaining emission geometries such as outer gaps , two - pole caustic slot gaps @xcite and the striped wind @xcite .",
    "this requires additional informations about , for instance , the magnetic field configuration at the location where the high - energy photons are produced .",
    "the polarization properties of the pulsed emission could give us a hint about the magnetic field and discriminate between competing scenarios .",
    "although there are only very little data available in optical or shorter wavelengths , polarization measurements will put severe constraints on these models .",
    "polarization properties at multi - wavelength would certainly help to discriminate between several geometries of the sites of emission .",
    "gamma - ray light - curves alone can already give good insight into the magnetosphere as shown by @xcite or about the geometry of the striped wind @xcite .",
    "the new sample of fermi - lat gamma - ray pulsars increased interest into modelling of gamma - ray emission .",
    "detection of several millisecond gamma - ray pulsars was not expected and came as a real surprise .",
    "thus , @xcite focused special attention to this class of millisecond pulsars to probe the geometry of the emission regions , taking into account relativistic effects .",
    "because of its brightness , the crab pulsar is the most extensively studied pulsar in the literature and therefore the best candidate to diagnose the magnetic field geometry through the detection of polarized emission .",
    "because it is one of the youngest gamma - ray pulsars and showing high brightness and luminosity , many precise measurements have been done , ranging from radio observations through optical up to x - rays and gamma - rays .",
    "highly accurate fully phase - resolved optical observations performed with the optima instruments have been done in the past by @xcite , completing earlier works by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies motivated comparative studies of the emission from polar caps , outer gaps @xcite and two - pole caustic models @xcite . in all of these models ,",
    "the radiation is produced within the light cylinder .",
    "however , the pulse profile is determined by the assumed geometry of the magnetic field and the location of the gaps .",
    "neither of these models are able to fit the optical polarization properties of the crab pulsar .",
    "they fail to explain the observed constant value of the polarization angle in the off - pulse state .",
    "the phase alignment between radio pulses and optical has also been checked recently . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the data become more sparse .",
    "for instance , in uv the crab was detected by @xcite in x - rays / soft gamma rays @xcite , hard x - rays @xcite and in gamma rays @xcite .",
    "there exists only a handful of pulsars for which polarization has been reported , exclusively in optical and mostly a phase - averaged value can be extracted .",
    "models of optical polarization of the crab pulsar have been proposed early after its discovery . @xcite",
    "introduced a relativistic vector model which has been fitted to the crab by @xcite and improved by subsequently more accurate measurements by @xcite .",
    "the spectral features above the optical are clearly non thermal and can be explained via some synchrotron and inverse compton radiation .",
    "however , the detailed mechanism , the geometry and location of the site of emission for this high - energy , pulsed emission is poorly constrained .",
    "it is usually explained in the framework of either the polar cap  @xcite or the outer gap models  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these models still suffer from the lack of a self - consistent solution for the pulsar magnetosphere and are based on the assumption that the magnetic field structure is that of a rotating dipole .",
    "it seems reasonable to fit the pulsed emission from the crab pulsar by a two - component model with a precise track of the pulse shape evolution with increasing energy .",
    "the detection of pulses above 25  gev by magic @xcite motivated further investigations .",
    "@xcite undertook a detailed analysis of the polarization and phase - resolved curvature , synchrotron and inverse compton emission from the outer gap model .",
    "this study has recently been refined by @xcite .",
    "some other authors invoked an anisotropic synchrotron model for infra - red to x - ray emission in the framework of the outer gap scenario , see @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we pursue our effort to investigate the ability of an alternative site for the production of pulsed radiation as firstly demonstrated by , based on the idea of a striped pulsar wind , originally introduced by @xcite and @xcite and further elaborated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the striped wind model gave already satisfactory fits to the optical polarization data from , for instance , the crab pulsar  @xcite assuming synchrotron radiation .",
    "by extension to higher energies due to inverse compton scattering , it is also possible to fit the pulsed and spectral variability of the gamma - ray spectra of the geminga pulsar with reasonable accuracy .",
    "synchrotron emission is able to reproduce the sample of fermi gamma - ray pulsars as shown in @xcite . for a throughout history of emission mechanisms outside the light - cylinder ,",
    "the reader is referred to the introduction of the above mentioned papers to find more literature on this topic . here ,",
    "we compute light - curves as well as phase - resolved polarization properties of gamma - ray pulsars in the synchrotron regime .",
    "radiation is mainly produced in the relativistically hot and dense current sheet by the synchrotron process .",
    "we use an exact analytical solution to the time dependent maxwell equations for a finite thickness of the stripes , attempted to relax the infinitely thin current sheet assumption .",
    "details of the model , including closed expressions for the electromagnetic field are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : modele ] .",
    "we then compute the properties of the synchrotron polarization characteristics .",
    "the relevant results are discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] before concluding this study .",
    "in this section , we present an improved analytical model of the striped wind with finite current sheet thickness . its main advantage compared to the prescription of @xcite is that no extra polodal component  @xmath0 has to be introduced and the electromagnetic field satisfies the homogeneous maxwell equations exactly .",
    "it is indeed possible to get an exact analytical solution for the electromagnetic field in a realistic striped pulsar wind , i.e. with a finite thickness for the current sheet and a magnetized flow wind expanding radially outwards at a constant speed  @xmath1 slightly less than the speed of light denoted by  @xmath2 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the following magnetic field structure satisfies the homogeneous set of maxwell s equation . in",
    "spherical polar coordinates @xmath3 centred on the star and with the @xmath4-axis along the rotation axis , the explicit expressions for the electromagnetic field components in the rest frame of the star are    [ eq : champ_em_strie ] @xmath5    here , @xmath6 is the radius of the light cylinder , @xmath7 is the angular velocity of the pulsar , @xmath8 is a fiducial magnetic field strength in the vicinity of the light cylinder , @xmath9 is the radial speed of the wind and @xmath10 represents a parameter quantifying the length scale of the current sheet thickness .",
    "it is easily checked that the homogeneous maxwell equations , namely @xmath11 and @xmath12 are exactly and analytically satisfied by the solution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : champ_em_strie ] ) .",
    "the current sheet is located in regions where the function @xmath13\\ ] ] is nearly zero , @xmath14 is the obliquity , i.e. the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes .",
    "note also that the magnetic structure does not possess the property @xmath15 in the equatorial plane of the light - cylinder .",
    "the ratio of their magnitude at that point is equal to  @xmath16 . nevertheless , this solution is physically satisfactory because it satisfies the constrain @xmath17 everywhere in space .",
    "indeed , the electric drift speed is given by    [ eq : vitesse_derive_electrique ] @xmath18    thus its magnitude becomes @xmath19 clearly less than @xmath2 for any @xmath20 and any @xmath21 . as a consequence ,",
    "there exists a reference frame for which the electric field vanishes , it is precisely the frame with speed equal to the electric drift speed  @xmath22 .",
    "the usual synchrotron emissivity can thus be computed in this special frame with the wind density and magnetic field in the electric drift frame defined by the speed @xmath22 , before switching to the observer frame via a lorentz transform .",
    "the magnetic field strength in the electric drift frame is most easily deduced from the relativistic invariance of the quantity @xmath23 .",
    "therefore we get @xmath24 \\ , \\tanh^2 ( \\psi_s/\\delta)\\ ] ] primed quantities are measured in the electric drift frame of the wind . the model employed to compute the gamma - ray pulse shape emanating from the striped wind",
    "is briefly examined in this section .",
    "the geometrical configuration and emitting particle distribution functions follows the same lines as those described in .",
    "the magnetized neutron star rotates at an angular speed of  @xmath7 , thus a period of  @xmath25 , directed along the @xmath26-axis , i.e. the rotation axis is given by @xmath27 .",
    "we use a cartesian coordinate system with coordinates  @xmath28 and orthonormal basis  @xmath29 .",
    "the stellar magnetic moment is denoted by  @xmath30 , it is assumed to be a dipole and makes an angle  @xmath14 with respect to the rotation axis such that @xmath31 .\\ ] ] this angle is therefore defined by @xmath32 .",
    "the inclination of the line of sight with respect to the rotational axis , and defined by the unit vector @xmath33 , is denoted by the angles  @xmath34 in spherical polar coordinates .",
    "thus @xmath35 we have @xmath36 .",
    "because the electric drift speed is less than the speed of light in whole space , it is possible to lorentz transform the electromagnetic field from the observer to a frame where the electric field vanishes . in that new frame",
    ", we can use the usual synchrotron formula for the intensity and the stokes parameters . in the wind frame",
    "where @xmath37 , the magnetic field transforms as @xmath38 its intensity in this frame becomes @xmath39 which is exactly eq .",
    "( [ eq : champ_magnetique_propre ] ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show the behaviour of the pulsed high - energy light - curves emanating from the striped wind flow for different combinations of the magnetic field and emitting particles configurations .",
    "we will not perform a detailed study of the phase - resolved spectral variability .",
    "thus for this purpose , it is sufficient to fix the particle density number and specify an index  @xmath40 for the power - law distribution in momentum space .",
    "we introduce a two component emission model including a relatively cold plasma part in the well organized magnetic field outside the stripe and a hot almost unmagnetized plasma part inside the stripe .",
    "we thus adopt the following expressions for the cold and hot particle density number respectively as    [ eq : densite ] @xmath41}{r^2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath42 sets the particle density number outside the current sheet , whereas @xmath43 defines the density inside the sheet .",
    "we refer to for more details about the justification of this choice .",
    "the radial motion of the wind at constant speed and the conservation law of the particle number imposes an overall @xmath44 dependence on this quantity , which is further modulated because the energization occurs primarily in the current sheet mainly due to adiabatic cooling .    for the synchrotron emissivity",
    ", we assume an isotropic power law distribution of leptons , and use the delta function approximation in the electric drift frame thus @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the photon energy in this frame , @xmath48 the thomson cross section and @xmath49 the magnetic energy density in this frame .",
    "we assume the emission commences when the wind crosses the surface @xmath50 .      for synchrotron radiation , the electric vector",
    "is directed towards the direction given by  @xmath51 where @xmath33 is the unit vector along the line of sight and @xmath52 the local magnetic field at the emission site . in order to relate the observations to the polarization properties in the wind",
    ", we have to find the direction of the polarization vectors in the lab frame  @xmath53 with respect to those in the drift frame  @xmath54 .",
    "relativistic kinematic implies a rotation effect on the polarization trihedron when transforming from  @xmath54 to @xmath53 . for later convenience",
    ", we denote vectors of the electromagnetic wave with lower cases @xmath55 whereas fields imposed by the exterior , which is independent of the existence or not of this wave , will be marked by upper cases  @xmath56 .",

    "indeed , for an isotropic distribution of particles , the elliptic polarization vanishes by average over polarization in opposite directions .",
    "only a linear polarization perpendicular to the magnetic field remains .",
    "the magnetic field of this wave is therefore @xmath61 . for a distant observer , at rest in  @xmath53",

    "( [ eq : tlb ] ) for the magnetic field .",
    "the norm of the electric field vector is  @xmath69 .",
    "the unit linear polarization vector is then @xmath70 this result is valid in general , whatever the inclination between magnetic field and plasma speed , see @xcite for more details .",
    "the polarization trihedron denoted by @xmath71 is chosen such that @xmath72 points in the direction parallel to the projection of the rotation axis  @xmath73 onto the plane of the sky therefore @xmath74 the polarization angle  @xmath75 measured by an observer in the rest frame  @xmath53 is chosen as the angle formed between the projection of the pulsar rotation axis onto the plane of the sky and the projection of the wave electric field onto the same plane .",
    "this angle  @xmath75 is defined by    [ eq : pulse : anglepoldef ] @xmath76    in our geometry , the rotation axis is aligned with the @xmath77 coordinate thus @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the special case of @xmath80 , we choose @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the calculation of the stokes parameters as measured in the observer frame involves simply integrating the emissivity over the wind volume .",
    "however , this requires special care , because the lorentz boost from the rest frame of the emitting plasma involves not only beaming and doppler shift , but also a change in the polarization angle due to aberration effects .",
    "the above treatment handled all these subtleties .",
    "after straightforward but lengthy manipulations involving lorentz transformations , we find the stokes parameters as measured by an observer at time  @xmath83 by the following integrals @xmath84 where the retarded time is given by @xmath85 . in this approximation",
    "the circular polarization vanishes : @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , the function  @xmath87 is defined by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the angular frequency of the emitted radiation , and @xmath90 is a constant factor that depends only on the nature of the radiating particles  ( charge @xmath91 and mass @xmath92 ) and the power law index @xmath40 of their distribution @xmath93 with @xmath94 the euler gamma function . in the present study ,",
    "the frequency @xmath89 is fixed and located between the lower and upper synchrotron cut - off frequency .",
    "the angle  @xmath75 measures the inclination of the local electric field with respect to the projection of the pulsar s rotation axis on the plane of the sky as seen in the observer s frame .",
    "the degree of linear polarization is defined by @xmath95 the corresponding polarization angle , defined as the position angle between the electric field vector at the observer and the projection of the pulsar s rotation axis on the plane of the sky is then @xmath96",
    "we performed many calculations by changing each of the parameter of the model in a reasonable range of values .",
    "we compiled these results in an atlas containing hundreds of light - curves and associated polarization characteristics .",
    "it is obviously impossible to publish and show all these simulated data in a paper . nevertheless , in order for the reader to get a flavour of the behaviour of these simulations",
    ", we will pick out some particular combinations of parameters which are relevant for understanding the evolution of polarization in the striped wind model .",
    "we now discuss the influence of these parameters on the polarization properties of the pulsed emission .",
    "the most important ones are    * the region where emission is supposed to start  @xmath97 . * the constant lorentz factor of the wind  @xmath98 . *",
    "the ratio of cold to hot particle density number  @xmath99 . * the power - law index of the lepton distribution  @xmath40 , let it be cold or hot .",
    "* the pulsar obliquity  @xmath14 . * the inclination angle of the line of sight  @xmath100 .",
    "we first look at the polarization properties depending on the location where emission starts , varying @xmath97 from @xmath101 to @xmath102 choosing values in the set @xmath103 .",
    "we indeed expect some variations of the emission characteristics because the electric drift speed and therefore the local frame where the electric field vanishes depends not only on @xmath21 but also on @xmath104 .",
    "we show a typical example in fig .",
    "[ fig : emission_r0_1 ] . in the following discussion , the specific set of parameters used to produce the plots are given in the frame title of the upper panel .",
    "we see that the position where photons are produced only weakly influences the shape of the light - curves , upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : emission_r0_1 ] .",
    "for the largest distances  @xmath97 , the phase of the maximal intensity is slightly delayed compared to the smallest distances . there is a monotonic trend to increase the phase shift with @xmath97 .",
    "this is explained by the delay introduced by the time of flight effect comparing two photons emitted at different radius but along the same line of sight .",
    "indeed the difference in arrival time of two photons produced at a radius @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively and normalized to the period  @xmath107 of the pulsar is given by @xmath108 see for instance equation  ( 31 ) in @xcite and the discussion therein for more explanation .",
    "the approximation is valid for @xmath109 . in the figure , for @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    "we get @xmath113 in agreement with the light - curves .",
    "we checked that for @xmath114 the same light - curves as those shown in figure  [ fig : emission_r0_1 ] almost overlap because the time lag is a factor 25 smaller thus not seen by eye .",
    "note that both pulses are not symmetric with respect to rising and falling time .",
    "next the polarization degree in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : emission_r0_1 ] demonstrates an increase in polarization for large  @xmath97 . very close to the light - cylinder , there is no significant polarization whereas for @xmath115",
    ", the polarization degree can reach up to 28% in the off - pulse phase in the particular case of @xmath116 . in this phase",
    ", only the cold part of the wind contributes to the emissivity .",
    "moreover this happens in a well - ordered magnetic field , therefore a high - polarization in accordance with a constant polarization angle as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : emission_r0_1 ] .",
    "the situation is drastically different in the pulses .",
    "indeed , the contribution of the hot component depolarizes the synchrotron emission which is almost zero in the middle of the pulses .",
    "meanwhile , the polarization angle suffers sharp gradient switching from -60/-80to + 60/+80within each pulse .",
    "there exists no obvious symmetry in the polarization angle variation in both pulses .",
    "the phase range where the variation is significant is largest for small starting radii and diminishes for the largest  @xmath97 .    .",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse_gamma ] the influence of the lorentz factor in the set @xmath117 on the polarization of the emission . for modest values of  @xmath98 ,",
    "the light - curves are highly asymmetric , the falling time being longer than the rising time .",
    "the shape of the pulses is a combination of the current sheet thickness and the relativistic beaming effect as long as the opening angle of the beaming is larger than the thickness of the stripe , both rescaled according to the pulsar period , namely 360= @xmath118 = one wavelength = one period .",
    "for increasing @xmath98 , the opening angle decreases like @xmath119 , explaining the sharpening of the pulse profile for @xmath120 compared to @xmath110 . at the point where the opening angle becomes comparable or even smaller than the thickness of the sheet , the pulse width decorrelates from the lorentz factor and we see the current sheet thickness and nothing else .",
    "thus , as expected , the width of the pulses tend to a minimum independent of the lorentz factor for @xmath109 .",
    "this is indeed shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse_gamma ] .",
    "less intuitive is the corresponding polarization degree , middle panel of fig .",

    "low lorentz factors correspond to high polarization degree , up to 18% in the case shown . for higher lorentz factors",
    ", @xmath121 decreases quickly , attaining only 8% for @xmath120 and a bit less than 2% for @xmath114 .",
    "it seems that relativistic flows depolarizes the synchrotron emission significantly in the striped wind .",

    "additionally , the kinetic structure of the stripe , temperature and density profile as well as particle velocity remain unknown .",
    "nevertheless , in order to estimate the behaviour of the polarization with respect to lepton populations , we investigate the change due to the particle density ratio @xmath122 chosen in the set @xmath117 .",

    "[ fig : pulse_densite ] .",

    "a higher density contrast , let us say @xmath123 , induces a fainter off - pulse level compared to the case @xmath124 , upper panel .",
    "this puts into picture the fact that the hot component is mainly associated with the pulses whereas the off - pulse part is essentially connected to the cold plasma component .",
    "the light - curves , whatever the density , do all overlap , all peaks are phase - aligned .",
    "the situation is identical for the polarization degree , its phase dependence looks similar for each curve .",

    "thus we studied also the variations induced by @xmath40 chosen in the set @xmath125 .",

    "we are far from a self - consistent treatment of the global mhd flows including possibly magnetic reconnection and turbulence within the sheet .",
    "current state of the art numerical computations are still unable to join the plasma kinetic regime to the fluid regime from the neutron star surface up to several tens or hundreds of light cylinder radii .",
    "the opportunity to get knowledge on the plasma in the wind on a theoretical basis seems far from reachable ."

    "<S> since the launch of the fermi telescope more than five years ago , many new gamma - ray pulsars have been discovered with intriguing properties challenging our current understanding of pulsar physics . </S>",

    "<S> the latter gives inside into the geometry of the emitting region as well as on the structure of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> based on an exact analytical solution of the striped wind with finite current sheet thickness , we analyze in detail the phase - resolved polarization variability emanating from the synchrotron radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the main contribution to the wind emissivity comes from a thin transition layer where the dominant toroidal magnetic field reverses its polarity , the so - called current sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting radiation is mostly linearly polarized . in the off - pulse region , </S>",
    "<S> the electric vector lies in the direction of the projection onto the plane of the sky of the rotation axis of the pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> this property is unique to the wind model and in good agreement with the crab data . </S>",
    "<S> other properties such as a reduced degree of polarization and a characteristic sweep of the polarization angle within the pulses are also reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are qualitatively unaffected by variations of the wind lorentz factor , the lepton injection power law index , the contrast in hot and cold particle , the obliquity of the pulsar and the inclination of the line of sight .    </S>",
