    "due to the small size of h@xmath5o molecules and to the hydrogen - bonding , liquid water is a very complex system with very peculiar properties . on the other hand ,",
    "the structure of liquid water is very sensitive to dissolved molecules or ions .",
    "the structural effects on water of dissolved ions have been extensively studied by neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "they have consequences on the physical properties of water .",
    "many of these have been studied as a function of the concentration of dissolved elements @xcite : surface tension , viscosity , gas solubilities , etc .",
    "however , the structural effects and properties were studied for relatively high concentrations of ions or of salt ( larger than 10@xmath6 m ) , probably because lower ion concentrations have a negligible effect on the hydrogen - bonding structure . even if a low concentration of a dissolved salt has a non - measurable effect on the hydrogen - bonding structure , it was shown that dissolved ions in very low concentration have a crucial effect on the stability of sub - microscopic bubbles in water @xcite .",
    "the structure and the properties of water around the stable sub - micorscopic bubbles are modified : the air / water interface of the bubbles changes the local chemical and biochemical reactive properties which can induce chemical or biochemical processes .    from the above remarks",
    ", it appears interesting to study the stability of sub - microscopic bubbles as a function of very weakly concentrated dissolved salts .",
    "solutions of lithium chloride and sodium chloride in pure water , from 0.2 m to 2.10@xmath0 m , were obtained by successive centesimal dilutions .",
    "the solutions were vigorously shaken after each centesimal dilution to produce microbubbles .",
    "the technique that was used to detect the presence of sub - microscopic bubbles is polarized rayleigh ( or rayleigh - gans ) light scattering @xcite . by this technique , it is possible to measure the intensity of light that is elastically scattered by sub - microscopic heterogeneities .",
    "the concomitant recording of the light scattering due to acoustical modes , that is the brillouin scattering , allows to normalize the rayleigh scattering intensity by taking the landau - placzek ratio ( noted as @xmath1 ) of the rayleigh intensity to the total brillouin intensity .",
    "because the brillouin scattering does not depend on the @xmath7 concentration of heterogeneities , the comparison of the landau - placzek ratios from different dilutions gives a relative measure of their respective rayleigh scattering intensities .",
    "after the presentation of the experimental results focusing on the dependence of the landau - placzek ratio on the concentration of alkali halide , as well as the effect of aging , the observed rayleigh scattering will be interpreted by the presence of elecrically charged sub - microscopic bubbles in the aqueous salt dilutions . it will be shown that the increase of the rayleigh scattering with the decrease of the salt concentration in the high dilution regime is rooted in an increase of the bubble size with decreasing salt concentration , making them stable due to electric interactions .",
    "in pure liquids , light is elastically scattered ( rayleigh scattering ) by dynamical fluctuations of density .",
    "it is well - known that in pure water , due to the approximate equality of the specific heats , respectively at constant pressure and at constant volume , the intensity of rayleigh scattering from density ( @xmath8 ) fluctuations , @xmath9 , is very weak at room temperature @xcite",
    ".    in aqueous solutions , for instance of salt , light is also elastically scattered by fluctuations of ion concentration .",
    "the dependence @xmath10 of the rayleigh scattering intensity on the weight concentration @xmath11 is expressed as @xcite :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the refractive index and @xmath14 the mean square value of the fluctuations of @xmath11 at constant pressure and temperature @xcite . for @xmath15 , @xmath14 is simply proportional to @xmath11 . @xcite the dependence on the angles specifying the direction of scattering relatively to the incidence direction is not given in eq .",

    "[ eq.2 ] is valid in the case of non - coherence between light waves scattered by different heterogeneities .",
    "if there exists coherence , @xmath17 must be replaced by @xmath22 .",
    "the coherence in the rayleigh scattering is expected in the case of an ordered ( for instance , periodic ) arrangement of heterogeneities .    in brillouin scattering , light is inelastically scattered by density fluctuations which are induced by sound waves propagating in the liquid .",
    "the brillouin frequency shift @xmath23 ( shift of the brillouin line relatively to the rayleigh line ) is proportional to the sound velocity , @xmath24 .",
    "the expression of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath24 is @xcite :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the vacuum wavelength of incident light and @xmath27 the angle between the scattering direction and the incidence one .    the dependence on the sound velocity of the brillouin intensity @xmath28 , that is derived from the relation between the sound velocity and the adiabatic hypersonic compressibility , is as follows @xcite :",

    "the observed decrease of the @xmath1 ratios by filtering with filters of different porosities testifies that the rayleigh ( or rayleigh - gans ) light scattering from diluted solutions with a salt concentration less than 2.10@xmath2 m is mainly due to submicroscopic heterogeneities ( @xmath16 ) , whose sizes are approximately distributed between 0.2  @xmath53 m and 1  @xmath53 m .",

    "the most outstanding experimental result is the variation of the landau - placzek ratio , @xmath1 , with the ionic concentration @xmath11 , in both licl and nacl solutions .",
    "the high level of the @xmath1 ratio for the c1 concentration ( 0.2 m ) is clearly related to @xmath10 , i.e. the rayleigh scattering by fluctuations of concentrations of li@xmath58 , or na@xmath58 , and cl@xmath59 . upon decreasing the concentration downto c3 ( 2.10@xmath2 m ) , the @xmath1 ratio decreases , as expected because @xmath10 is proportional to the ion concentration @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by the fact that the @xmath1 ratio for highly concentrated solutions is unchanged whether the solutions are shaken or not .",
    "furthemore , it is observed that the @xmath1 ratio for licl concentrations larger than 2.10@xmath2 m is unchanged after aging ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this means that at these high concentrations , the light scattering is largely dominated by the fluctuations of ion concentration , in comparison with a much weaker effect associated with the possible presence of nanobubbles created by the shaking , which becomes detectable at higher dilution rates .",
    "surprisingly , the @xmath1 ratio increases when the ion concentration decreases , to reach a maximum in the c5-c9 ( 2.10@xmath3m-2.10@xmath0 m ) concentration range ( figs  [ fig2 ] ,  [ fig3 ] ,  [ fig5 ] ,  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "it must be noted that the minimum of the @xmath1 ratio after the second shaking is always lower than that observed for the reference samples , and the maximum is always higher ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "no such variation was observed for non - shaken solutions : the @xmath1 ratio of the highly diluted solutions ( @xmath61 m ) was approximately the same as that of pure water .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that the shaking of the solutions has a decisive effect on the @xmath1 ratio for the highly diluted solutions . given the extreme care taken in this study about the purity of the samples , it is natural to associate this effect to bubbles created by the vigorous shakings of the solutions upon their preparation .",
    "all the observations described in the previous section prove that the intensity of rayleigh scattering in the highly diluted solutions is dominated by the intensity @xmath16 that is mainly due to the nanobubles or submicrobubbles which are created by the shakings .",
    "( 1 ) the possibility that the heterogeneities are clusters of hydrogen - bonded water molecules can be rejected because by using different experimental techniques like low - frequency raman scattering , or small angle x ray scattering @xcite , one failed to observe any defined clusters in water . moreover , since @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath62 , i.e. , the square of the difference between the refractive indices of heterogeneity and of water ( eq .  [ eq.2 ] ) , it is evident that hypothetical clusters of hydrogen - bonded molecules would have a negligible effect on the @xmath1 ratio in comparison with air bubbles .",
    "( 2 ) we observed that the ratio @xmath47 ( of scans rejected due to scattering flashes ) rapidly decreases during the first few days after the shaking .",
    "when it is stabilized , its variation with the concentration qualitatively follows that of the @xmath1 ratio , except in the interval between c1 and c3 where the number of rejected spectra is close to zero ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the objects , which are at the origin of the flashes , and therefore of the rejected spectra , have a micrometric size larger than 2  @xmath53 m as indicated in the previous section .",
    "the only objects , visible by eye observation through an optical microscope in the highly diluted solutions , were a few moving bubbles with sizes in the range between 2 and 10  @xmath53 m .",
    "it is then very likely that the origin of the rejected spectra be these micrometric bubbles , whereas the sub - micrometric heterogeneities responsible for the light scattering at lower concentrations are _",
    "sub_-microscopic bubbles .",
    "in other words , when strong scattering is visible to the eye as flashes , the cause is microscopic bubbles while when strong scattering ( i.e. large @xmath1 ratios ) is invisible to the eye , it arises from sub - microscopic bubbles , both causes being filiated .",
    "it is interesting to remark that @xmath47 is close to zero in the c1-c3 ( 0.2m-2.10@xmath2 m ) interval , so that in these stabilized solutions at these concentrations , no sub - micrometric bubbles are expected to exist or the bubbles are too small ( nanobubbles ) to efficiently scatter the light .",
    "( 3 ) in figure  [ fig6 ] , one observes that the @xmath1 ratios of solutions kept 5 months in suprasil cuvettes do not change in the c1-c3 range , while they are strongly decreased for @xmath63  m.    from the values of the r / b ratios observed from solutions filtered with different porosities one may deduce that the diameter @xmath64 of the bubbles that are at the origin of the measured r / b ratios , is 0.2 @xmath53 m @xmath65 1 @xmath53 m for @xmath66  m. for @xmath67  m the diameter of the nanobubbles , if they exist , should be @xmath68 m .      .    before searching the origin of the stability of nanobubbles or submicroscopic bubbles detected by rayleigh - brillouin scattering in diluted solutions of licl or nacl in water ,",
    "it is emphasised that the absence of observed light scattering by heterogeneities for salt concentrations higher than 2.10@xmath69 m does not mean that for these concentrations bubbles are absent . from eq .",
    "[ eq.2 ] , the rayleigh scattering from heterogeneities is proportional to square of the heterogeneity volume .",
    "therefore , it is possible that nanobubbles , for which the rayleigh light scattering is negligible because of their too small size , exist at these concentrations .",
    "the above deduction from experiment , that the air bubbles are responsible for the rayleigh scattering by heterogeneities in diluted and shaken licl or nacl solutions , poses a problem : because of the surface tension of water , the pressure inside a bubble is inversely proportional to the bubble radius and , in consequence , should be much too high for the existence of long - lived nanometric or sub - micrometric bubbles",
    ". this problem can not be resolved by considering the changes of the macroscopic properties of water by dissolution of salt , because , as it was experimentally demonstrated @xcite , salts such nacl and licl that were dissolved at concentrations less than 10@xmath6 m , have no effect on the properties of water , like surface tension , viscosity or gas solubilities . as @xmath16 depends strongly on the dissolved ions ,",
    "it is thought that these ions , by their distribution in the solution , have a direct effect on the bubble stability and that the change of their concentration must explain the change of bubble volume .",
    "the effect of ions on the stability of bubbles in water has been extensively studied by bunkin and co - workers @xcite .",
    "ions with the same electric charge , covering the surface of the bubbles , create , through their mutual repulsion , a negative pressure that is opposite to the surface - tension pressure .",
    "it was shown that such stabilizing ions at the surface of bubbles are anions @xcite .",
    "the covering of the bubble surface by cl@xmath59 anions is consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations which show that chloride anions have some propensity for the air / water interface , while sodium cations are repelled from this interface @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the classification of ions according to their partitioning coefficients between bulk water and air - water interface , as deduced from surface tension @xcite : according to this classification , the concentration of li@xmath58 and of na@xmath58 at the air - water interface is zero while that of cl@xmath59 is markedly different from zero .",
    "the pressure inside a bubble of radius @xmath70 , that is due to the water surface tension , @xmath71 , is :    @xmath72    if @xmath73 is the surface density of monovalent ions around the bubble and @xmath74 the dielectric constant of water , a simple calculation of electrostatics gives for the negative electric pressure , @xmath75 , inside the bubble :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the electron charge .",
    "neglecting the electric field due to the other ions in water , especially to the solvated cations which diffuse in the space between electrically charged bubbles , the equilibrium is reached when @xmath78 . in this case , the radius of bubble versus @xmath73 is :    @xmath79    to give an idea of the surface density of ions located around a nanobubble , one chooses @xmath70=50  nm that is of the order of the radius estimated by bunkin et al .",

    "it is interesting to note that from eq .",
    "[ eq.8 ] the lower the surface ion density the larger the bubble radius . in order to estimate the consequence of this relation on the @xmath1 ratio",
    ", we can make the following hypotheses , that seem realistic at low concentrations of ions : ( 1 ) the total volume @xmath84 of bubbles per unit volume is constant ; ( 2 ) the total number of ions surrounding the bubbles in the unit volume is proportional to the ion or salt concentration @xmath11 .",

    "[ eq.8 ] , it can thus be deduced that @xmath85 and @xmath86 . because , from eq .  [ eq.2 ] , @xmath87 , one obtains @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , by a dilution of a factor 100 of licl or of nacl in water , @xmath16 , i.e. the @xmath1 ratio in the highly diluted regime , should be multiplied by 10@xmath83 .",
    "this increase of the intensity of light scattering by nanobubbles or sub - micrometric bubbles with the decrease of the square of salt concentration gives only a trend of the evolution of @xmath1 with the dilution : it allows to qualitatively justify the observed increase of the @xmath1 ratio with the dilution rate in the high dilution regime ( @xmath892.10@xmath69 m ) , as well as it accounts for the observed absence of light scattering by bubbles for @xmath902.10@xmath2 m .      after having established that the compensation of @xmath91 by @xmath75 can lead to an increase of bubble volume with the decrease of ion concentration , the consequences of the bubble electric charge on the lifetime bubble assemblies in a given container have to be elucidated .",
    "the interaction between bubbles may have several origins @xcite : electric , mechanical , hydrophobic .",
    "in presence of ions , it is likely that the interaction between negatively charged nanobubbles is mainly electric . due to the co - presence of cations in the solutions ,",
    "the negatively charge nanobubbles may , instead of mutually repelling , assemble through the attractive interaction with the cations that diffuse in the inter - bubble space .",
    "the electrostatic bonding between two bubbles through the cation mediation can be relatively strong .",
    "bunkin et al .",
    "@xcite evidenced the presence in water of micrometric aggregates of electrically charged nanobubbles linked by intermediate cations .",
    "the hypothesis of stable negatively charged nanobubbles linked by intermediate cations in aqueous solutions of @xmath92-cyclodextrin was also proposed by jin et al .",
    "however , from a very recent experimental study @xcite , the light scattering from aggregates of nanobubbles is negligible in comparison with the light scattering from separate bubbles for nacl concentration lower than @xmath93 m .",
    "this finding supports that for @xmath63  m the light is scattered from separate bubbles in our very diluted solutions .    the long lifetime of nanobubbles and the observed dependence on the container of this lifetime ( figures  [ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] ) can be due to the negative charge of the nanobubbles . by hydrolysis of silica and the dissociation of the silanol sioh groups into sio@xmath59 and h@xmath58 ions ,",
    "the glass walls become negatively charged @xcite , so that the charged nanobubbles are submitted to an electric interaction @xcite that stabilizes them .",
    "such interaction is expected to depend on the chemical nature of the surface walls ; from our observations , it is expected to be weaker in schott - duran containers ( and suprasil cuvettes ) than in borosilicate containers .",
    "an additional possible reason for the long - lifetime of the negatively charged nanobubbles can be the affinity of anions for the air - water interface , so that the air / water interface in the cuvettes ( meniscus ) , like in the bubbles , would also be negatively charged . together with the cuvette walls",
    ", this would add stability to the negatively charges bubbles .",
    "microscopic and submicroscopic heterogeneities created by shaking of ultrapure aqueous solutions of licl and nacl with dilution ratios covering sixteen decades were studied through rayleigh - brillouin scattering . from salt concentrations lower than 2.10@xmath2 m , the rayleigh light scattering was found to increase with the decrease of salt concentration , while for concentrations larger than 2.10@xmath94 m it was found , as expected , to evolve according to concentration fluctuations .",
    "all the experimental observations converge to the identification of the submicrometric heterogeneites with air nanobubbles that were created by the shaking .",
    "as already proposed by different authors @xcite , the covering of the bubble surface by negative ions creates an electric pressure which compensates the strong surface tension pressure inside the bubbles , thus stabilizing them .",
    "the stabilization of the bubbles by surrounding cl@xmath59 anions is consistent with the increase of the rayleigh light scattering intensity with the decrease of salt concentration , from concentrations lower than 2.10@xmath2 m .",
    "this increase can be explained by the fact that the surface density of ions around a bubble is inversely proportional to the square - root of the bubble radius , combined with the fact that the intensity of rayleigh light scattering by submicroscopic bubbles is proportional to the number of bubbles per unit volume @xmath17 times the square of the bubble volume , @xmath95 .",
    "the long lifetime of the submicroscopic bubbles , that can reach more than 6 months , is probably related to the fact that these bubbles are electrically charged , thereby electrically interacting with the electrically charged walls of the container . along these lines",
    ", the bubble lifetime is expected to change with the electric charge of the walls , and the electric charge of the walls is expected to change with the nature and the amount of ions released in water by these walls . therefore , the bubble lifetime depends on the container .",
    "the nature of the ions covering the air - water interface of stable nanobubbles is correlated to the classification of ions according to their partioning coefficient between bulk water and air - water interface . as shown by pegram and record @xcite",
    "such a classification is close to the hofmeister series @xcite whereby salts or ions are ranked according to their effectiveness as protein precipitants .",
    "a challenging continuation of our works would thus be to study the stability of nanobubbles as a function of the position of the ions in the hofmeister series .",

    "pileni for judicious advices .",
    "they are very grateful to b. jourdain and s. preunkert ( lgge / cnrs , grenoble ) for providing us with ultrapure water .",

    "<S> the first stage corresponds to the decrease of the rayleigh scattering by the ion concentration fluctuations with the decrease of salt concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the second stage , at lower concentrations , is consistent with the increase of the rayleigh scattering by long - lived sub - microscopic bubbles with the decrease of ion concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of these sub - microscopic bubbles is the shaking of the solutions which was carried out after each centesimal dilution . </S>",
    "<S> the very long lifetime of the sub - microscopic bubbles and the effects of aging originate in the electric charge of bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of @xmath1 with the decrease of the low salt concentration corresponds to the increase of the sub - microscopic bubble size with the decrease of concentration , that is imposed by the bubble stability due to the covering of the surface bubble by negative ions . </S>"
