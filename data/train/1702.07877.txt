    "therefore , in our model , and after fixing the amplitude of the scalar perturbations from the observational data , the time of horizon exit @xmath173 is independent of its @xmath81-fold number @xmath172 . as an important result",
    ", we conclude that the inflationary observables ( [ n_s , t ] ) , ( [ d.n_s , t ] ) , ( [ n_t , t ] ) , and ( [ r , t ] ) evaluated at @xmath173 are independent of @xmath172 .",
    "now , we can estimate the inflationary observables in our model and check their consistency versus the cosmological data . to do so",
    ", first we solve equation ( [ p_s , n _ * ] ) numerically to find @xmath167 for given parameters @xmath110 , @xmath163 , and @xmath174 .",
    "then , we use the obtained value for @xmath167 in equation ( [ t , n ] ) and find @xmath173 .",
    "subsequently , we evaluate the inflationary observables ( [ n_s , t ] ) , ( [ d.n_s , t ] ) , and ( [ r , t ] ) at the time of horizon exit @xmath173 .    in order to check the viability of logamediate inflation ( [ a(t ) ] ) in our @xmath0-gravity model ( [ f(t ) ] ) , we use equation ( [ n_s , t ] ) and ( [ r , t ] ) and plot the prediction of our model in @xmath180 plane as shown in figure [ figure : r , n_s ] . in this figure , the marginalized joint 68% cl and 95% cl regions of the planck 2015 data @xcite have been specified .",
    "we have represented the results of our model with @xmath111 and @xmath181 in the figure as black and orange lines , respectively .",
    "each line is related to a specific value for the parameter @xmath174 , while the parameter @xmath163 varies . in each case , as @xmath163 increases , @xmath160 approaches @xmath182 and @xmath161 approaches @xmath19 .",
    "the case @xmath111 corresponds to tegr , which provides the same results of the standard inflationary scenario .",
    "it is obvious in the figure that for @xmath111 , logamediate inflation is completely ruled out by planck 2015 tt , te , ee+lowp data @xcite .",
    "but , our study indicates that if we take the parameter @xmath110 greater than @xmath182 , then logamediate inflation ( [ a(t ) ] ) in our @xmath0-gravity model ( [ f(t ) ] ) can be compatible with the planck 2015 results .",
    "for instance , as we see in figure [ figure : r , n_s ] , for @xmath181 , logamediate inflation is consistent with the joint 68% cl region of planck 2015 tt , te , ee+lowp data @xcite . in figure [ figure : lambda , a ] , we have specified the parameter space of @xmath163 and @xmath174 for which our model with @xmath181 is compatible with the 68% cl or 95% cl regions of planck 2015 tt , te , ee+lowp data @xcite . from the figure",
    ", we conclude that for @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) , our model is compatible with the joint 68% cl ( 95% cl ) region of planck 2015 tt , te , ee+lowp data @xcite . in table [ table : d.n_s ] , we present the ranges of the parameter @xmath163 for which our model with @xmath181 and with some typical values of @xmath174 is consistent with the planck 2015 observational data @xcite . in table [ table : d.n_s ] , we also present the predicted values for the running of the scalar spectral index @xmath185 obtained using equation ( [ d.n_s , t ] ) .",
    "the predicted values for @xmath185 in our model are compatible with the 95% cl constraint provided by planck 2015 tt , te , ee+lowp data @xcite .    at the end of this section ,",
    "it is useful to provide some explicit estimations for the inflationary observables in our model .",
    "we choose @xmath181 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 . using equation ( [ n_s , t ] ) , ( [ d.n_s , t ] ) , and ( [ r , t ] ) , we obtain @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 , respectively , and these are in good agreement with planck 2015 tt , te , ee+lowp data @xcite . using equation ( [ n_t , t ] ) ,",
    "our model predicts the tensor spectral index to be @xmath191 , and this value may be verified by more precise measurements in the future . within our model , we can also provide some predictions for other parameters , including the time of horizon exit @xmath173 and the end time of inflation @xmath167 . with the chosen values for @xmath110 , @xmath163 , @xmath174 , and taking the horizon exit @xmath81-fold number as @xmath192",
    ", we obtain the end time of inflation from the numerical solution of equation ( [ p_s , n _ * ] ) as @xmath193 . applying this in equation ( [ t , n ] )",
    "gives the time of horizon crossing as @xmath194 .",
    "here , we recall that in our logamediate inflationary model , although the value of @xmath167 depends on @xmath172 , the value of @xmath173 is completely independent of it .",
    "we have investigated logamediate inflation in the framework of @xmath0-gravity which is sourced by a canonical and minimally coupled scalar field . for this purpose",
    ", we first briefly reviewed the basic equations governing the cosmological background evolution in @xmath0-gravity and presented the relations of the scalar and tensor power spectra in this scenario .",
    "then , we considered a setting in which the @xmath0 function in the action has the power - law form @xmath195 , where @xmath110 and @xmath109 are constant parameters . for @xmath111 ,",
    "this reduces to @xmath47 which provides the same results as for einstein gr . in addition , in our work we considered the logamediate scale factor @xmath196 $ ] , where @xmath117 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constant parameters . for @xmath119 ,",
    "the logamediate scale factor turns into the power - law scale factor @xmath120 , where @xmath121 .",
    "our investigation implies that , although logamediate inflation is not consistent with the the planck 2015 data @xcite in the standard framework based on einstein gravity , we can make it compatible with the observational data in our @xmath0-gravity model , if we take the parameter @xmath110 greater than @xmath182 . for instance , we showed that for @xmath181 , the result of the logamediate inflation in @xmath180 plane can lie inside the 68% cl region favored by planck 2015 tt , te , ee+lowp data @xcite . using the @xmath180 test , we determined the parameter space for @xmath163 and @xmath174 in our model with @xmath181 , and showed that for @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) , our model is consistent with the joint 68% cl ( 95% cl ) region of planck 2015 tt , te , ee+lowp data @xcite .",
