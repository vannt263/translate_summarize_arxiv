    "mode identification is very important in the field of asteroseismology . in general",
    ", the pulsations observed in white dwarfs are non - radial g - mode ones .",
    "the pulsation mode can be characterized by three indices @xmath18 in which @xmath19 is the spherical harmonic degree , @xmath20 is the number of the radial nodes , and @xmath21 is the azimuthal order . if a star is spherical symmetric , @xmath21 would be degenerate , i.e. modes with the same @xmath19 and @xmath20 but different @xmath21 will have the same frequency .",
    "if a star is rotating , rotation will destroy this spherical symmetry and lead to the frequency splitting . in the asymptotic approximation ,",
    "the formula of frequency splitting due to rotation is as follows ( brickhill 1975 ) @xmath22\\omega\\ ] ] in which @xmath23 is the frequency of mode with indices @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the rotation frequency of white dwarf .",
    "it is evident that a frequency with @xmath0 will be splitted as three ones and called a triplet ; and a frequency with @xmath5 will be splitted as five ones and called a quintuplet .    according to the asymptotic theory of g - mode , on the other hand , an expression of periods of a mode with @xmath19 and @xmath20(unno et al .",
    "1979 ; tassoul 1980 ) is @xmath26 in which @xmath27 is the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath28l@xmath28 frequency , and @xmath29 is the stellar radius . for a white dwarf ,",
    "the right integral in the above equation is approximately invariable .",
    "this also means that pulsation periods of different modes with the same @xmath19 and two adjacent @xmath20 should have an uniform period spacing . according to eq.(2 ) , there exists an approximate relation @xmath30 between the period spaces of different modes with @xmath0 and with @xmath5 .    using the above asymptotic expressions of g - mode , we reanalyze the 19 independent pulsation modes of gd 1212 from the two - wheel - controlled kepler spacecraft(see table 1 in hermes et al . 2014 ) . owning to the frequency splitting of rotation",
    ", we identify 2 sets of complete triplets and 4 sets of doublet in table [ tbl-1 ] . for 4 sets of doublet",
    ", we assume that the frequency with larger amplitude is the mode with @xmath31 . from table",
    "[ tbl-1 ] , we can obtain that the frequency splitting of modes with @xmath0 due to rotation is about 20 @xmath32 . according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) and each values of frequency splitting in table [ tbl-1 ] , we can estimate the rotation period of gd 1212 which are listed in the last column in table [ tbl-1 ] . in the calculated results ,",
    "we can notice a rotation period of @xmath33 h which is significantly different from others .",
    "this is because of the too small difference of the frequency between the modes of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . according to table 1 in hermes et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we notice that the error of frequency of @xmath35 is 3.54 @xmath32 .",
    "the small difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 may be due to the observational error .",
    "so we assume that the mode of @xmath35 with frequency @xmath36 @xmath32 and the other two modes of @xmath37 and @xmath34 make up of a set of triplet . at last , we estimate the mean rotation period of gd 1212 is @xmath7 h , in which we do nt consider the rotation period by the frequency splitting between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    in 19 pulsation modes ,",
    "the other five frequencies are unidentified for the absence of frequency splitting .",
    "we perform asymptotic analysis for the five pulsation modes . from table",

    "because only one component for these modes has been observed , we hypothesize that they are the ones with @xmath38 .",

    "<S> the zz ceti star gd 1212 was detected to have 19 independent modes from the two - wheel - controlled kepler spacecraft in 2014 . by asymptotic analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we identify most of pulsation modes . </S>",
    "<S> we find out two set of complete triplets , and four sets of doublet which are interpreted as rotation modes with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> for the other five modes , the four modes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are identified as ones with @xmath5 ; and the mode @xmath6 is identified to be the one with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile we derive a mean rotation period of @xmath7 h for gd 1212 according to the rotation splitting . using the method of matching the observed periods to theoretical ones </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the best - fitting model with the four parameters as @xmath8 , @xmath9 k , @xmath10 , @xmath11 for gd 1212 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that due to the gradient of c / o abundance in the interior of white dwarf , some modes can not propagate to the stellar interior , which leads to the period spacing of the adjacent modes to become large . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is just proven by the observational data from gd 1212 . </S>",
    "<S> all of these imply that gd 1212 may be evolved from an intermediate mass star . </S>"
