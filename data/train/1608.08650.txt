    "the _ sloan digital sky survey _ discovered several ultra - faint dwarfs galaxies  ( ufds ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , these ufds contain only @xmath5 to @xmath6 stars and they are composed of an old and extremely metal poor stellar population , suggesting that the ufds are the closest objects to the first galaxies  ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "for some of them , the majority of the stars were likely to have formed before reionization , corresponding to a universe age of @xmath7  gyr old  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite reported the first discovery of highly @xmath0-process enriched stars in a ufd , reticulum ii , while there are only strong upper limits on the abundances of @xmath0-process elements for some other ufds  @xcite .",
    "these measurements that show large fluctuations in the @xmath0-process abundance imply that only a single @xmath0-process event took place in reticulum ii .",
    "following these observations of @xmath0-process material in the classical dwarfs and ufds , a question that naturally arises is what is the rate and amount of matter produced in @xmath0-process events that are consistent with these observations .",
    "we estimate here the most likely mass ejection of fe and eu and rate of ccsne per total luminosity and of @xmath0-process production events relative to ccsne .",
    "we use a likelihood analysis , based on poisson statistics .",
    "the formulation is independent of the specific nature of the sources of @xmath0-process elements .",
    "we use the given measured fe and eu abundances in dwarf galaxies and their initial gas masses ( to which those metals were injected ) .",
    "we assume that all dwarf galaxies ( or alternatively , only ufds ) share the same mechanism for @xmath0-process production .",
    "the results in both cases ( of all dwarf galaxies and just ufds ) strongly suggest that the @xmath0-process event rate is considerably smaller than the ccsn rate .",

    "[ sec : dnsrates ] and peculiar ccsne in  [ sec : ccsne ] .",
    "finally we summarize our results in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider dwarf spheroidal galaxies and focus in particular on ufds which are composed of old and metal poor stars  ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we consider galaxies for which there are reported detections or upper limits on the fe and eu abundances .",
    "our sample includes five ufds : reticulum ii , segue i , segue ii , coma berenices and ursa major ii .",
    "in addition we consider 6 more massive classical dwarf galaxies : carina , sculptor , draco , leo i , ursa minor and fornax .",
    "we do not consider sagitarius , since this galaxy has been shown to be considerably tidally disrupted @xcite , and its mass is therefore very uncertain .",
    "table  [ tbl : data ] shows the v - band luminosities , @xmath8 , the velocity dispersions , @xmath9 , and the half light radii , @xmath10 taken from @xcite , and the average fe and eu abundances  .",
    "the errors of the average abundances shown in table  [ tbl : data ] includes statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "if the systematic errors of the measurements for a galaxy are not available in the literature , we simply assume a systematic error of @xmath11  dex .",
    "to evaluate the number of events that supplied eu or fe in each galaxy , the total amount of the elements produced in it is needed .",
    "we assume that the elemental abundances of stars in dwarf galaxies represent the amount of the elements in the gas from which the stars have been formed .",
    "the total amount of fe and eu produced in a galaxy during active star formation is estimated using the elemental abundances listed in table [ tbl : data ] , together with the gas mass into which metals are injected .",
    "the relatively low stellar luminosities as compared with the total halo masses suggest that ufds have lost most of their initial gas due to either supernova feedback or igm reionization  @xcite .",
    "thus the observed upper limits ( @xmath12 ) on their current gas mass are not representative of the amount of material into which the @xmath0-process elements have been injected at the early stages of their evolution .",
    "therefore , we estimate the amount of the gas based on the assumption that the initial gas mass is proportional to the halo mass within the size of the stellar spheroidal .    when considering the mass loss from the dwarf galaxies we assume that the gas is chemically homogeneous with the average abundances , as observed in the remaining stars",
    ". however , of course , the chemical mixing process in the gas is inhomogeneous and a fraction of the produced material may escape from the galaxies or alternatively gas with a primordial composition may escape .",
    "such effects should be taken into account when considering the abundance distribution of stars in each dwarf galaxy .",
    "these issues should be addressed with hydrodynamics simulations  ( see e.g. @xcite ) and are beyond the scope of this work .    the initial gas mass , @xmath13 , should be between the total stellar mass of the system and @xmath14 of the total halo mass of the system ( we take here the typical fraction of @xmath14 for the baryonic to total mass in a halo ) . as mentioned above , however , the stellar mass of ufds is significantly smaller than the halo mass due to significant gas loss throughout the formation and evolution of the galaxy .",
    "we estimate @xmath15 using the halo mass within a given radius , @xmath16 .",
    "this can be calculated directly from measurements of the half - light radius @xmath10 and the velocity dispersion @xmath9 by using the jeans equation  ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath17}\\approx   1.2\\times 10^{3 } m_{\\odot }   \\left(\\frac{r}{1~{\\rm pc } } \\right ) \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{1~{\\rm km / s } } \\right)^2\\frac{(r / r_{1/2})^2}{1+(r / r_{1/2})^2},\\label{mass } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the plummer model for the stellar distribution with an isotropic and constant velocity dispersion are assumed .",
    "the halo masses within the half - light radius estimated with this formula by @xmath18 are shown in table  [ tbl : data ] .",
    "of course , this formula , can only be used up to the radius where the above assumptions are valid . as a fiducial model , we use @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . according to the plummer distribution",
    ", this choice corresponds to that the material within the radius @xmath21 , where @xmath22 of the stellar mass is included , contributes to the chemical mixing of the injected metals . for comparison ,",
    "we consider also initial halo masses that are smaller , @xmath23 , or lager than @xmath24 by a factor of 3 .    as the assumptions made in eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) may be invalid at @xmath21 for some large dwarf galaxies , we also employ an alternative way to estimate the halo masses within @xmath21 : using the navarro - frenk - white  ( nfw ) mass profile with the model parameters derived in @xcite , and integrating the distribution up to @xmath21 .",
    "this method can only be carried out for the classical dwarfs .",
    "for the ufds there are insufficient observations of stellar kinematics at large enough radii that would constrain the model parameters . in all but one case ( fornax ) , this estimate results in similar values to those obtained with the first method .",
    "table  [ tbl : mass ] provides a summary of the different masses .",
    "we compare the gas masses estimated obtained here with the literature . using a cosmological simulation of the first galaxies , @xcite",
    "show that population ii stars are formed from cold gas of @xmath25 at the center of a galaxy with a total mass of @xmath26 .",
    "the smallest gas masses in our sample , @xmath27@xmath28 for reticulum ii , segue i , and sugue ii , are consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "the total mass of fe and eu produced in the system are estimated as : @xmath29 } m_{\\odot }    \\left(\\frac{m_{g}}{10^{5}m_{\\odot}}\\right),\\label{eu}\\\\ m_{\\rm eu }   & \\approx   & 3.7\\cdot 10^{-5+[\\rm{eu / h } ] } m_{\\odot }    \\left(\\frac{m_{g}}{10^{5}m_{\\odot}}\\right),\\label{eu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assume that metals with an eu ( fe ) abundance of [ eu / h ] ( [ fe / h ] ) are injected into a gas with an initial mass @xmath15 and used the solar abundances from @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : eu ] depicts the estimated total fe and eu masses for each dwarf galaxy as a function of the total stellar luminosity .",
    "note that the fe mass is proportional to the luminosity within uncertainties , implying that the number of sne producing fe is proportional to the number of stars . for the eu masses , while the similar trend can be found , the dispersion is larger for the smaller galaxies .",
    "we find @xmath34 for reticulum ii .",
    "for the other ufds there are strong upper limits , in some cases as small as @xmath35 .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that there was only a single @xmath0-process production event in reticulum ii and none in the other ufds .",
    "we aim to constrain the event rate and mass per event for both sne and @xmath0-process events .",
    "we begin with a description of the general statistical method that we use in both cases .",
    "we define the likelihood function in terms of two unknown parameters : @xmath36 , the average rate of events and @xmath37 the mass of an element @xmath38 produced by a single event .    using poisson statistics we calculate the probability of obtaining @xmath39 events in the @xmath40th galaxy , given an expected number of events @xmath41 .",
    "we assume that the mass of @xmath38 produced per event follows a normal distribution with an average of @xmath37 and a standard deviation of @xmath42 . for each @xmath39",
    "the associated probability is then the poisson probability of obtaining @xmath39 events times the probability that @xmath39 events would lead to an accumulated mass of element @xmath38 in the @xmath40th galaxy , @xmath43 ( calculated from the observed values of [ x / h ] and @xmath13 ) . summing these probabilities over all @xmath39 s we obtain the final probability : @xmath44 .",
    "finally we write the likelihood function as : @xmath45 we maximize , of course , this function over its free parameters .",
    "we begin applying the method described in  [ stat ] to constrain the rate of fe - producing sne and the amount of fe produced per event in these dwarf galaxies .",
    "the resulting likelihood function is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : likelihoodsne ] .",
    "the main constraint is on the product of the two parameters .",
    "this reflects the fact that the average fe mass per solar luminosity should match the observed ratio .",
    "the actual peak of the likelihood function is not strongly constrained , although interestingly , it coincides with an fe mass per event of @xmath46 and a rate of @xmath47 sne per @xmath48 ( approximately @xmath49 stars ) .",
    "these values are in fact expected from sne studies . in the local universe ,",
    "two thirds of ccsne are type ii supernovae that typically produce @xmath50 of fe and type ibc that produce @xmath51  @xcite and one third of ccsne are type ibc  @xcite . therefore the fe production is dominated by type ibc supernovae . in addition , since the star formation epoch in dwarf galaxies had lasted for a short time - sclae of @xmath52  gyr , we assume that type ia sne do nt contribute to the fe production .",
    "thus @xmath53 per ccsn is expected for dwarf galaxies .",
    "in addition , the rate , of @xmath54 sne per @xmath48 is consistent with observations suggesting @xmath55 sn per 100@xmath56 of star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observational constraints on the rate and fe mass per event from the local universe are depicted by the red cross in fig .",
    "[ fig : likelihoodsne ] .",
    "this result suggests that the fe production in each ccsn and their rate in metal - poor environments are similar to those in the local universe .",
    "in addition , it demonstrates the validity of this method .",
    "and the number of sne per @xmath48 stellar luminosity ( roughly @xmath49 stars ) for the entire sample of dwarf galaxies .",
    "also shown as a cross is the fe mass per ccsn and ccsn rate in the local universe  @xcite . here",
    "we adopt an uncertainty in the mass and rate by a factor of @xmath27 . ]",
    "we turn now to the production of eu in @xmath0-process events .",
    "we calculate the rates relative to the ccsn rate , @xmath57 . using the results of the previous section ( and independent analyses ,",
    "see  [ sec : fe ] ) we assume an average production of @xmath53 of fe per ccsn . the average number of @xmath0-process events in the @xmath40th galaxy is then : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the total amount of fe in the same galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig : likelihood ] shows the results for two cases : all dwarf galaxies  ( left ) and only ufds  ( right ) .",
    "the likelihood function peaks at a rate relative to the sn rate of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , and at a mass per event of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , corresponding to a total mass of @xmath0-process matter produced per event of roughly @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the strong upper limits on the eu abundance of some galaxies coupled with the detection of a significant amount of eu in galaxies of similar masses , implies that the eu mass produced per event should be approximately the smallest amount detected in any given galaxy . notice that this situation is very different than the case for fe production , where the same statistical method results in no preference for a small number of events per galaxy .",
    "this leads to a relative rate of @xmath0-process to ccsn events which is @xmath66 .",
    "thus we can rule out the possibility that normal ccsne dominate the production of @xmath0-process materials in dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "interestingly , this rate of eu production , is consistent with the constraints from our own , much more massive galaxy .",
    "assuming one ccsn per 100@xmath56 of star formation , and given a total stellar mass of @xmath67 @xcite , we obtain @xmath68 such sne in the history of the milky way @xcite .",
    "combining this with a total eu mass of @xmath69 , leads to : @xmath70 with a systematic uncertainty of a factor of @xmath71 . the range permitted by these observations",
    "is depicted as the area between the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : likelihood ] . as seen in that figure ,",
    "this range is consistent with the best fit parameters found for the dwarf galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the low rate is consistent with @xmath72 that @xcite find in order to reproduce the @xmath73pu abundances of both the early solar system material   and the present - day deep - sea archives  @xcite .",
    "these suggest that the @xmath0-process production in the milky way is dominated by the same events as in dwarf galaxies . therefore , these results for the rate and mass per event can be generalized , and the same process could be the dominant source of @xmath0-process production in the whole universe .",
    "we turn now to explore the dependence of the results on the assumed halo masses . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : initial ] , there is some uncertainty in the values of these masses .",
    "we repeat the calculation ( for all dwarf galaxies ) with halo masses of @xmath23 ( smaller by about an order of magnitude as compared with @xmath24 ) and @xmath74 . for @xmath23 ( @xmath74 ) ,",
    "the likelihood peaks at a eu mass per event of @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and at a rate relative to the sn rate of @xmath77 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "as expected the amount of eu mass per event , is approximately the minimal eu mass observed in any galaxy and thus tracks linearly the halo mass . in addition , since @xmath57 is roughly : @xmath78 and since @xmath79 are linear in the halo mass , it follows that @xmath57 is inversely proportional to this quantity .",

    "the @xmath0-process mass per event that we find in the likelihood analysis described in  [ sec : like ] , is roughly consistent with expectations for dns mergers from simulations .",
    "these simulations typically find ejecta masses of @xmath82@xmath83 corresponding to eu masses of @xmath84@xmath85 @xcite .",
    "the results are also consistent with macronova estimates  @xcite .",
    "the strong upper limits of @xmath86 for the other ufds imply that such events did nt take place in these ufds .",
    "we turn now to estimate the expected rates of dns mergers in these galaxies and compare them to the results from the likelihood analysis in  [ sec : like ] .",
    "the expected number of @xmath0-process production events by dns inside a ufd during its star formation epoch is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the fraction of mergers with a center of mass velocity , @xmath89 smaller than the escape velocity of a ufd , @xmath90 , and with a merger time , @xmath91 , shorter than the duration of star formation phase , @xmath92 .",
    "the small escape velocities from ufds ( down to @xmath93 in some cases ) and the relatively short durations of their star formation @xmath94  gyr , reduces the number of mergers providing @xmath0-process elements in the star forming gas .",
    "however , in @xcite we have shown that since many dns systems receive small kicks at birth @xcite , a large fraction of them would have @xmath95kms@xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , given limits on the separation of the double pulsar system before its second collapse , a significant fraction of systems are expected to both remain confined in ufds and merge within less than a gyr .",
    "all together , we estimate that : @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , using our result in   [ sec : like ] , the number of mergers per ccsn is estimated as @xmath98@xmath99 .",
    "we compare the results also with the merger rate estimated using short grb observations .",
    "the local short grb rate is estimated as @xmath100  @xcite , where @xmath101 is a beaming factor that is in the range @xmath102  @xcite .",
    "the rate of local ccsne is @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the number of short grbs per ccsn is @xmath104 , consistent with our estimates above .      the low rate and large amount of @xmath0-process elements per event @xmath105 challenge the standard ccsn scenarios .",
    "a neutrino - driven wind of proto - neutron stars of normal ccsne is clearly incompatible with the low rate .",
    "however , the low rate can be consistent with a peculiar astrophysical explosion associated with a core collapse of massive stars .",
    "for instance , a magnetically powered outflow from newly born magnetars has been proposed as the site of the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "this could happen in a peculiar sn ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or in a long grb , in which case the magnetic outflow also powers the grbs itself .",
    "a neutrino driven - wind from an accretion torus of newly formed black holes  @xcite and fall - back supernovae  @xcite have also been suggested as the production sites .",
    "the rate of long grbs has been estimated as @xmath106  gpc@xmath107 yr@xmath96 before beaming corrections @xcite .",
    "this is comparable , up to a factor of 3 with the rate of short grbs .",
    "given a lower rate , more @xmath0-process mass per event is required .",
    "but of course this also depends on an unknown beaming factor .",
    "low luminosity grbs and superluminous sne have also been proposed to involve magnetized outflows ( or for the latter , winds from accretion tori around black holes ) .",
    "the rates of these events are @xmath108  gpc@xmath107 yr@xmath96  @xcite and @xmath109  gpc@xmath107 yr@xmath96  @xcite , corresponding to a rate relative to ccsne of approximately @xmath110 .",
    "this is at the upper end of the permitted range that we find (  [ sec : like ] ) , and would in turn , require the @xmath0-process mass per event to be at the low end of the permitted range ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "@xcite have estimated that a neutrino - driven wind from a black - hole accretion torus can produce @xmath112 , which seems too small to be consistent with the permitted range that we find here .",
    "other estimates of @xmath0-process material production yield @xmath113 for a sn magnetized driven jet @xcite and @xmath114 for a magnetized neutrino - driven wind @xcite .",
    "since these processes require rapid rotation , and hence low metallicity , these authors estimate that the rate of such events is low compared to regular sne",
    ". however , the exact rates are uncertain .",
    "we have explored the question of iron and @xmath0-process production in dwarf spheroidal galaxies in a model independent fashion .",
    "we assume that all dwarf galaxies ( or alternatively , only ufds ) share the same mechanism for production of these elements .",
    "we then use the element abundances and apply a likelihood method to estimate the most likely rates and element mass produced per such event . using the mass within the radius that contains @xmath22 of the galaxies light , @xmath24 , as a proxy for the halo masses ( which in turn provides the initial gas mass ) , we find that on average @xmath53 of fe is produced per ccsn and that the rate is approximately 16 ccsne per @xmath115 , verifying the estimated values of these parameters from independent studies using different methods @xcite .",
    "turning now to @xmath0-process events , we find that the eu mass per event is between @xmath1 ( @xmath116 for ufds only ) .",
    "the very strong upper limits on the eu mass in some galaxies combined with detections of significantly larger masses in other dwarfs , imply that eu production is dominated by rare events , and that the minimal eu mass observed in any galaxy is approximately the amount of eu mass produced per event .",
    "this corresponds to a total @xmath0-process mass of @xmath2 ( @xmath117 for ufds only ) , assuming that @xmath0-process events dominate the production of elements with mass number @xmath118 .",
    "the rate of these events is @xmath3 as compared with the ccsn rate ( @xmath119 for ufds only ) .",
    "we conclusively rule out the possibility that the rates of @xmath0-process events could be comparable to that of ccsne . interestingly , both the @xmath0-process mass per event and the rate are , however , consistent with expectations for dns mergers . however , rare magnetic driven sne , long grbs , superluminos sne or even low luminosity grbs are all possible candidates .",
    "furthermore , these values are consistent with the total eu mass observed in our own galaxy .",
    "this suggests that the same mechanism is behind the production of @xmath0-process events in both ufds and the milky way , and that it may be the dominant mechanism for production of @xmath0-process elements as a whole in the universe .",
    "association of a gravitational - wave event from a dns merger and a clear macronovae from which the amount of @xmath0-process production can be well estimated could therefore confirm or reject this scenario .    a large scatter in the abundances of @xmath0-process elements ,",
    "is also seen in metal poor stars in our own galaxy , which again supports rare events ( e.g. , ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite have shown that the rarity of @xmath0-process events is broadly consistent with @xmath73pu abundances of both the early solar system material   and the present - day deep - sea archives  @xcite , that are difficult to explain otherwise .",
    "the @xmath0-process element enrichment in halo stars with very low metallicities , proposed as a problem for this scenario , can be resolved by taking into account the turbulent mixing of material in the galaxy  @xcite , the assembly of sub - halos during the formation of the galaxy  @xcite , the large typical distances between the locations of the stellar collapses and the eventual mergers @xcite as well as the likely possibilities of rapid mergers and stellar collapses with small amounts of mass ejecta @xcite .",
    "given the orbits of the observed dns systems in the galaxy , a significant amount of dns systems are expected to both remain confined within ufds and merge within a relatively short time since formation @xcite . using these results and assuming @xmath0-process production is dominated by dns mergers",
    ", we estimate the dns merger rate to be @xmath98@xmath120 per ccsn .",
    "this is comparable to the rates estimated using other methods such as from short grbs or from population synthesis .",
    "there are two major differences between the dns and core - collapse scenarios .",
    "first , dns mergers have delay times relative to the star formation but the core - collapse events do nt .",
    "moreover since the rare core - collapse events , discussed above , may take place preferably in low - metallicity environments they may even precede the average star formation and produce @xmath0-process elements in very low metallicity environments .",
    "however the region will be  polluted \" by mass outflow from the progenitor stars , oxygen and carbon from winds and fe from the associated sn .",
    "second , during the formation of the second neutron star in a dns the center of mass receives a velocity of @xmath121  km / s  @xcite . this is slower than the typical escape velocity from ufds but fast enough to run away from the star forming regions where they have been formed .",
    "thus the mergers can take place in low - metallicity environments that are  unpolluted \" by the progenitors .",
    "this depends , of course on the pace of turbulent mixing within the ufd .",
    "these differences should be reflected in the distribution of eu and fe within the galaxies and in the chemical history of the galaxy .",
