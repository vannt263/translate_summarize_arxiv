    "while large surveys are rapidly increasing the number of known quasars , our understanding of the quasar phenomenon grows more slowly . however , absorption lines caused by material intrinsic to the quasar hold great promise for revealing the conditions near the supermassive black holes that power them .",
    "the richest and most extreme absorption lines are found in quasars with broad absorption lines ( bals ) .",
    "about 10 - 15% of optically - selected qsos have restframe ultraviolet spectra showing these bals - deep absorption troughs displaced blueward from the corresponding emission lines in the high ionization transitions of civ , siiv , nv , and ovi ( hibals hereafter ) .",
    "about 10% of balqsos also show broad absorption in lower ionization lines of mgii or aliii ( lobals ) .",
    "balqsos in general have higher optical / uv polarization than non - bal qsos , but the lobal subsample tends to have particularly high polarization ( schmidt & hines 1999 ) along with signs of reddening by dust ( sprayberry & foltz 1992 ; egami et al .",
    "all the bals are commonly attributed to material along our line of sight flowing outward from the nucleus with velocities of 5,000 up to @xmath6  km  s^-1  km  s@xmath7",
    ". the observed ratios of broad emission and absorption line equivalent widths @xmath8 and the detailed profiles of civ bals both imply that the covering factor of the bal region must be @xmath9 ( hamann et al .",
    "this observation , together with the similar fraction of qsos showing bals suggests that most or possibly _ all _ qsos contain bal - type outflows .",
    "the optical / uv emission lines and continuum slopes of hibal qsos are remarkably similar to those of non - balqsos ( weymann et al . 1991 ) .",
    "balqsos may thus provide a unique probe of conditions near the nucleus of most qsos .",
    "ironically , although viewed from an obscured direction , balqsos may nevertheless be particularly revealing .    in the last decade , a significant observational effort has been dedicated to balqsos in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and x - ray bandpasses .",
    "the absorbing columns typically inferred from the uv spectra for the bal clouds themselves ( e.g. , @xmath10 ; korista et al .",
    "1992 ) appear low enough that we would _ a priori _ expect very little x - ray absorption ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "it was initially a surprise then , to discover that balqsos are markedly underluminous in _ soft _ x - rays compared to their non - balqso counterparts . contrasting a complete sample of 36 balqsos in the large bright quasar survey and the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) with carefully chosen comparison samples , green et al .",
    "( 1995 ) revealed definitively that balqsos are _ soft x - ray quiet as a class_. deeper archival rosat pspc pointings of 11 _ bona fide _ balqsos confirmed this ( green & mathur 1996 ; gm96 hereafter ) , yielding unusually steep optical - to - x - ray slopes for balqsos ( @xmath4@xmath12 is the slope of a hypothetical power - law from 2500 to 2  kev ; @xmath13 . ] ) relative to non - bal qsos ( @xmath4@xmath14 ) in the rosat bandpass . by _ assuming _ that the intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of balqsos are similar to those of non - bal qsos , gm96 found that absorbing columns of @xmath15 are necessary to quench the x - ray flux to observed ( or upper limit ) levels .",
    "gallagher et al .",
    "( 1999 ) studied a sample of 8 balqsos with asca , of which only 2 were detected .",
    "they estimated column densities of @xmath16 to explain the non - detections , even higher than the rosat estimates . in some cases ,",
    "the absorber is probably compton thick ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) , as in asca observations of pg0946 + 301 ( mathur et al . 2000 ) .    if the uv and x - ray absorption in quasars arises in the same region ( e.g. , mathur et al .",
    "1994 ) , the large derived x - ray columns increase the best uv - derived estimates of both the ionization and mass outflow rate of bals by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "these highly ionized bal outflows then represent a significant component of the qso energy budget . but a single zone photoionization model may not be appropriate , and other intriguing possibilities remain .",
    "balqsos have been interpreted as normal qsos seen along a line of sight either ablating off the edge of an obscuring torus , or accelerated from the surface of the accretion disk in a wind ( e.g. , murray & chiang 1997 ; dekool & begelman 1995 ; elvis 2000 ) . in this case",
    ", the inner wind - driven x - ray absorber shields the uv bal clouds , so that the uv bal zone has a lower ionization than the x - ray absorber .    even if the x - ray and uv absorbers are identical , the geometry , covering factor , temperature , density , metallicity and ionization parameter of the absorbing clouds are poorly constrained from uv absorption line studies alone .",
    "the few absorption lines observed provide little if any constraint on the ionization of the absorbing material , leading to the simplifying assumption that the observed ions are the dominant species .",
    "furthermore , bals in the uv are often saturated ( wang et al .",
    "1999 ) , and column densities derived from uv measurements may also be significantly underestimated due to partial covering of the continuum source ( hamann 1998 ; arav et al .",
    "higher ionization absorbers are indicated not just by the x - ray absorption , but by the detection of uv absorption in neviii , ovi , and sixii ( telfer et al .",
    "uv spectropolarimetry implies columns consistent with x - ray results ( goodrich 1997 ) - the most common uv bals are saturated , but partially filled in with scattered light .",
    "many results support the picture that balqsos are _ intrinsically normal _ qsos , with the bal region an important part of every qso s structure .",
    "suggestive links between low - ionization balqsos and ir - luminous mergers ( fabian 1999 ) , and similarities between balqsos and and narrow line seyfert  1 galaxies ( mathur 2000 ; brandt & gallagher 2000 ) may also support a scenario where balqsos are adolescent quasars in a transition phase , evolving from active high @xmath18 ( high eddington fraction ) to normal qsos .",
    "if the bal phase represents a high accretion rate period in a quasar s lifetime , than an intrinsic power - law steeper than that for non - bal qsos might be expected , by analogy to narrow line seyferts and galactic black hole candidate binary systems in outburst ( leighly 1999 ; pounds , done , & osborne 1995 ) .",
    "are the intrinsic seds of balqsos really the same as non - bal qsos ?",
    "x - ray spectroscopy can confirm the absorption interpretation , and verify whether the underlying ( unabsorbed ) emission supports the hypothesis that balqsos are typical qsos seen from a privileged line of sight , or rather a different phase or species of qso . unfortunately ,",
    "due to low observed fluxes , there are only a handful of balqsos with x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "\\(1 ) in a 100ksec asca spectrum , mathur et al . ( 2000 ) found evidence that pg0946 + 341 is compton thick , but this again was based on assumptions that the underlying spectrum and normalization was that of a normal qso , since the counts were too few for detailed spectral fitting .",
    "\\(2 ) mathur et al .",
    "( 2001 ) analyzed an asca spectrum of the prototype balqso phl5200 ( with @xmath19 ) , wherein intrinsic absorption of @xmath20 was required , covering 80% of the source .",
    "intriguingly , the best - fit power - law photon index is related to the energy index @xmath21 by @xmath22 . ] in the 210kev range ( @xmath23 ) for phl5200 is steeper than typical for non - balqsos .",
    "\\(3 ) simultaneous asca / rosat fitting of pg1411 + 442 ( wang et al . 1999 ) shows a hard x - ray slope typical for non - balqsos ( @xmath24 ; george et al .",
    "2000 ; reeves & turner 2000 ) , but there is also evidence for a strong , steep ( @xmath25 ) component of soft x - ray emission , where non - bal qsos typically show @xmath26 . at @xmath27",
    "however , pg1411 + 442 is the least luminous balqso and suffers significant contamination from star - forming regions in its host galaxy .",
    "\\(4 ) gallagher et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found one balqso , pg2112 + 059 ( @xmath28 ) which has perhaps the brightest flux of any balqso .",
    "a best - fit power - law of slope @xmath29 , partially ( @xmath30 ) covered by @xmath31 @xmath32 of intrinsic absorption suggests that this object could be a shrouded example of a typical qso .",
    "however , while the object s ` balnicity ' index of 2980  km / s seems to classify it firmly a balqso , the bals are atypically shallow , and the derived column rather low .",
    "further x - ray spectroscopy is critical to our basic understanding of balqsos , but is needed for some more typical objects , and for as large a sample as is feasible . to begin to address this problem systematically , we performed a snapshot x - ray survey of balqsos during cycle  1 of the chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) .",
    "we describe below the chosen sample (   [ sample ] ) and their chandra observations , ensemble spectral fitting (   [ spectra ] ) , x - ray brightness (   [ aox ] ) , and the significance of our findings (   [ discuss ] ) .",

    "we compiled a list of _ bona fide _",
    "balqsos with magnitudes ( usually @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) brighter than 17th .",
    "we derived expected countrates using chandra pimms , assuming that the intrinsic sed ( before absorption ) of balqsos is similar to that of typical radio - quiet qsos at similar luminosities . for the x - ray spectral photon index @xmath35",
    ", we used 2.5 in the soft x - ray band ( schartel et al .",
    "1996 ) , and 1.8 above 2kev ( lawson & turner 1997 ) .",
    "the power - law normalizations were derived from the observed optical magnitudes using values of @xmath4 typical for normal qsos ( @xmath36 ; green et al .",
    "we then calculated the absorbed chandra broadband flux assuming a ( @xmath37 ) absorbing column of @xmath38 , which corresponds to an intrinsic column of @xmath15 at typical sample redshifts .",
    "we thus calculated our proposed chandra exposure times to result in a strong detection for each source .",
    "the resulting sample spans a wide range of balqso phenomena , including : redshifts from 0.1 to 2.4 , four dusty lobal qsos , two lobal qsos with metastable excited states of feii and feiii ( hazard et al .",
    "1987 ) , a radio - moderate balqso ( becker et al . 1997 ) , and a gravitationally lensed balqso .",
    "table  [ tsample ] lists the sample in order of increasing right ascension , and includes mostly non - x - ray information .",
    "all sources were observed between 1999-dec-30 and 2000-may-15 using the back - illuminated s3 chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board chandra .",
    "for the ( optically ) brightest object iras07598 + 6508 ( @xmath39 ) , we used a subarray for more rapid readout , to avoid possible pileup of counts in acis .",

    "x - ray celestial coordinates matched optical counterpart coordinates to within @xmath41arcsec , so that there is no ambiguity about identification .",
    "we used reprocessed data , and extracted acis gain - corrected pulse height invariant ( pi ) spectra from a 2.5 region around each qso , using the ` psextract ` script described in the standard thread for chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao2.0 ) .",
    "this script creates an aspect histogram file , and the rmf and arf calibration files appropriate to the source position on chip ( which is time - dependent due to dither ) and ccd temperature ( @xmath42c ) .",

    "the total background normalized to the source extraction area was less than one count , so we ignore background henceforth . in all analyses ,",
    "we ignored channels below 0.5kev , since the acis response at lower energies is not well calibrated . above 0.5kev ,",
    "the calibration is accurate to better than 10% .",
    "channels above 6kev were also ignored because of insufficient counts .",
    "two final pi spectrum files were created for each source , one with no binning and one binned to a minimum of 5 counts per bin .",
    "we perform spectral modeling for the six sources from table  [ tobs ] with more than 20 counts .",

    "the key feature is that all the intrinsic column density parameters @xmath51 are linked together , giving just a single free `` intrinsic absorption '' component .",
    "similarly , the overall model amplitudes are free to vary individually , but again only one global power - law spectral index is fitted .",

    "the intrinsic absorbing column was estimated simply scaling up n@xmath77  until the expected x - ray fluxes ( predicted using @xmath33 and @xmath4 ) matched the observed fluxes or flux upper limits .    in the current study , we detect most of the balqsos , and now confirm via actual spectral fitting that the underlying continuum is consistent with that of normal radio - quiet qsos . in the ensemble spectrum",

    "however , the measured fraction is likely decreased by x - ray emission reflected towards us by clouds having a direct line of sight to the nucleus .",
    "such reflection should be associated with increased polarization , but polarization measurements for 6 of the objects in our sample show no correlation with @xmath82 , @xmath83 or @xmath4 .      only about 1% of optically - selected qsos show broad absorption in lower ionization lines of mgii or feii . by contrast",

    "we have included 4 lobal qsos in our chandra sample . since",
    "insufficient counts are available from the lobals , the spectral model we adopt is from hibal qsos only .",
    "this also means that the de - absorption applied to the x - ray fluxes of the lobals probably underestimates their true column , causing even the the de - absorbed @xmath73 and @xmath4 values in table  [ tobs ] and figure  [ flums ] for these objects to look particularly x - ray weak .",
    "we can interpret the difference between the @xmath4 values for lobal qsos plotted in figure  [ flums ] and a de - absorbed @xmath4 of 1.7 ( the mean value for the hibal qsos alone ) to be due to additional absorption in lobals that is unaccounted for in our spectral model .",
    "the minimum difference is @xmath84 , based on the lower limits to @xmath4 of the undetected lobal qsos . even neglecting any optical extinction",
    ", this corresponds to additional quenching of @xmath85 of at least a factor of six .",
    "assuming that the same ( @xmath86 ) intrinsic power - law applies to all balqsos , we can infer that lobal qsos are shrouded by at minimum an additional intrinsic column of nearly @xmath87 @xmath32 beyond that of the hibalqsos .",
    "lobal qsos may also have intrinsically steeper spectra so that their x - rays are more easily absorbed .",
    "even more rare than lobals in optical surveys are the `` iron lobals '' , which exhibit absorption lines from metastable excited levels of feii .",
    "there are just a few iron lobal qsos known to date : q0059 - 2735 , firstj0840 + 3633 and j1556 + 3517 ( becker et al .",
    "1997 ) , and hawaii 167 ( cowie et al .",
    "becker et al . (",
    "1997 ) noted a trend of radio power increasing with reddening and proposed that , as lobals become more extinguished optically , their radio power increases , making iron lobal qsos a special radio - intermediate population of balqsos .",
    "sensitive radio surveys may thus uncover many more iron lobal qsos .",
    "we have observed two of the known iron lobal qsos , q0059 - 2735 and firstj0840 + 3633 .",
    "both are quite weak in x - rays , the former not detected at all .",
    "this indicates that iron lobals , if they are indeed qsos , may be nearly compton thick ( @xmath88 ) , so beyond the reach of most x - ray surveys except perhaps at high redshift where their observed - frame x - rays correspond to more penetrating hard x - ray emission in the quasar rest - frame .",
    "the decrease in polarization toward longer wavelengths in some lobals suggests edge - on dust - scattering models ( kartje 1995 ) where the scattered line of sight is less reddened , so that lobal qsos have been proposed as the _ most _ edge - on qsos ( brotherton et al .",
    "1997 ) . on the other hand",
    ", lobal qsos may be nascent qsos embedded in a dense , dusty star formation region ( e.g. , voit , weymann , & korista 1993 ) .",
    "the expected strong extinction has been seen ( sprayberry & foltz 1992 ; boroson & meyers 1992 ) , and could explain their low ( 1 - 2% ) incidence in optically - selected samples .",
    "luminous infrared galaxies such as iras07598 + 6508 may have both nuclear starbursts and active nuclei fueled by large masses of gas and dust within a few hundred pc of the nucleus arising from mergers and viscous accretion ( canalizo & stockton 2000 ) .",
    "nearby examples such as this object may be accessible analogs of high redshift galaxies seen in their peak epoch of formation and growth ( scoville 1999 ) .    based only on their observed x - ray luminosities , an alternative to absorption",
    "is that lobal qsos may contain at best very weak agn , and are instead dominated by massive starbursts ( e.g. , risaliti et al .",
    "the brightest nearby spiral galaxies observed by fabbiano & trinchieri ( 1985 ) show log@xmath89 , and ellipticals achieve log@xmath90 , which is near to the apparent x - ray luminosity of our 2 detected lobal qsos . the nearby starburst galaxy ngc  3256 is driving a `` superwind '' ( moran et al .",
    "1999 ) , and achieves log@xmath91 , similar to the lobal qso iras07598 + 6508 in the current sample .",
    "however , the optical / uv emission and absorption line properties of lobal qsos clearly indicate velocities far higher than achievable even by starburst superwinds ( leitherer , robert , & drissen 1992 ) .",
    "an alternative to the orientation hypothesis , where every qso has bal clouds visible only along a privileged line of sight , is that balqsos are in a phase of high accretion rate .",
    "if so , in analogy to narrow line seyfert  1 galaxies we expect the intrinsic power - law to be significantly steeper than normal qsos ( mathur 2000 ; brandt & gallagher 2000 ) .",
    "the underlying power - law that we detect in the current study does not favor such an interpretation . on the other hand , some counterexamples of steep x - ray spectrum balqsos may exist ( phl5200 mathur et al . 2000 ; pg1411 + 442 , wang et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in the orientation interpretation of the bal phenomenon ,",
    "@xmath92 of qsos show bals because the overall bal covering factor is @xmath92 .",
    "the recent discovery of radio - selected balqsos with both compact and extended radio morphologies , with both steep and flat spectra is inconsistent with a simple unified orientation scheme , which predicts only steep - spectrum sources for an edge - on geometry .",
    "predominantly compact radio morphology and steep radio spectra in radio - selected balqsos are reminiscent of compact steep spectrum quasars .",
    "these have been interpreted as young radio objects that are confined to a small region by dense gas , but which later evolve extended radio lobes as they escape confinement ( odea 1998 ) , analogous to the evolutionary model of balqsos as young quasars emerging from cocoons ( voit et al .",
    "rather than directly interpreting the fraction of qsos with bals as a covering factor , the observed fraction may instead reflect the portion of a qso lifetime with strong outflows at large covering factor .",
    "if in addition , mergers and interactions that trigger growth and accretion occur more frequently at early epochs as expected , then an evolutionary trend is predicted ; balqsos should be more common at high redshifts .",
    "if a large , relatively unbiased sample of balqsos can be accumulated , both evolution and orientation may need to be invoked to explain the observed population .",
    "a recent tally ( chartas 2000 ) of qsos has shown that 35% of gravitationally lensed qsos show bals , more than 3 times the rate in flux - limited optical qso surveys . while the fraction of balqsos may increase with look - back time",
    ", another viable explanation is that lensing magnification overcomes attenuation of the balqso optical emission , such that presently available flux - limited surveys of bal quasars detect more gravitationally lensed balqsos .",
    "grey attenuation of a factor of about 5 , as also suggested by goodrich ( 1997 ) from polarization observations of balqsos , together with plausible average lensing magnification factors of @xmath93 , successfully reproduce the observations . the resulting prediction that the fraction of balqsos should increase with survey sensitivity ( see also krolik & voit 1998 ) seems to be borne out by the fact that at least 3 of 5 of the @xmath94 qsos found so far in the sloan digital sky survey show bals ( zheng et al .",
    "however , these ( small sample ) statistics could support either a lensing or an evolutionary model .",
    "increasingly , low - energy x - ray absorption is being reported in quasars at high redshift ( yuan et al . 2000 ; fiore et al .",
    "1998 ; elvis et al . 1994 ) . at this writing , the qso with the highest known redshift ( sloan digital sky survey sdssp  j104433.04 - 012402.2 at @xmath95 ; brandt et al .",
    "2001 ) is also x - ray weak ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "balqsos and similar absorbed agn may provide a significantly larger fraction of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxrb ) than would be estimated from their contribution to typical optically - selected samples .",
    "furthermore , as the simplest model fits demonstrate ( table  [ tfit ] ) , low s / n absorbed x - ray spectra of balqsos will look hard ( @xmath97 ) like the cxrb spectrum .",
    "the apparently high fraction and nature of obscured faint sources with hard x - ray spectra reported in early deep chandra fields ( e.g. , giacconi et al .",
    "2001 ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "2001 ) is being hotly debated , but may contain many such objects .",
    "our results provide a caution to interpretations of the spectra of these faint hard x - ray sources .",
    "distant obscured quasars detected with very few counts may appear to be hard enough to compose much of the cxrb , while their true continuua could taper off more quickly at higher energies .",
    "table  [ tfit ] shows that partial covering can also strongly affect the apparent continuum slope even when absorption is detected .",
    "extremely deep pointings may find a small number of such objects bright enough so that better x - ray spectral constraints are available .",
    "samples of high redshift and/or optically reddened objects from larger areas should be amassed at brighter fluxes by serendipitous surveys wider sky coverage like the champ ( green et al . 1999 ; wilkes et al . 2001 ) . stacking or simultaneous fitting of x - ray spectra",
    "as performed here could help establish the detailed spectral characteristics and evolution of x - ray absorption in quasars .",
    "we have carried out a short - exposure chandra survey of a sample of 10 bright broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos , with exposures ranging in length from 1.3 to 5.4  ksec .",
    "eight out of ten sources are detected , with observed counts ranging from 8 to 113 .",
    "corresponding fluxes are rewardingly bright in the chandra ( 0.5 - 8  kev ) bandpass , ranging from @xmath98 to @xmath99erg  cm^-2  s^-1[berg  @xmath32  s@xmath69 .",
    "simultaneous fitting of spectra from six balqsos detected by chandra shows that the `` composite '' balqso has an underlying power - law spectral index @xmath100 that is @xmath59 covered by an intrinsic absorber of column @xmath101@xmath32 .",
    "our x - ray spectral constraints should represent those of an average high ionization balqso .",
    "we note that the best - fit absorption column ( with partial covering ) of @xmath102 is far higher than would be naively measured from uv spectra from bal equivalent widths or by direct conversion of residual intensity to optical depth , robustly confirming earlier suggestions .",
    "truly high s / n x - ray spectra of typical balqsos are still coveted , since the cloud properties can then be studied in detail and compared to spectral information from the bals in the restframe uv .",
    "scattering models can in principle be tested with a soft x - ray polarization measurement .    for the detected qsos ,",
    "the de - absorbed optical to x - ray spectral slope ( @xmath3 from 2500  to 2kev ) varies from 1.6 to 2.3 .",
    "the high - ionization balqsos in our sample have de - absorbed values of @xmath3 consistent with those measured in optically - selected radio - quiet qsos of similar luminosity .",
    "the low - ionization balqsos in our sample are x - ray weak , even after correcting for the composite intrinsic absorption .",
    "one explanation is that the absorbing column in these objects is substantially higher , but further investigation is of great interest , especially given the possible links of these objects to ultraluminous ir galaxies and mergers .",

    "<S> we have carried out a survey with the chandra x - ray observatory of a sample of 10 bright broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos . </S>",
    "<S> eight out of ten sources are detected . </S>",
    "<S> the 6 brightest sources have only high ionization bals ( hibals ) , while the 4 faintest all show low ionization bals ( lobals ) . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a combined spectral fit for hibal qsos ( 384 counts total , 0.5 - 6kev ) to determine the mean spectral parameters of this sample . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an underlying best - fit power - law slope @xmath0 , consistent with the mean slope for radio - quiet quasars from asca , but balqsos require a ( restframe ) absorbing column of @xmath1 , with a partial covering fraction of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical to x - ray spectral slope ( @xmath3 from 2500  to 2kev ) varies from 1.7 to 2.4 across the full sample , consistent with previous results that balqsos appear to be weak soft x - ray emitters . removing the absorption component from our best - fit spectral model yields a range of @xmath4 from 1.55 to 2.28 . </S>",
    "<S> all 6 hibal qsos have de - absorbed x - ray emission consistent with non - bal qsos of similar luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral energy distributions of the hibal qsos - both the underlying power - law slope and @xmath4- provide the first conclusive evidence that balqsos have appeared to be x - ray weak because of intrinsic absorption , and that their underlying emission is consistent with non - bal qsos . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , removal of the best - fit absorption column detected in the hibal qsos still leaves the 4 lobal qsos with values @xmath5 that are unusually x - ray faint for their optical luminosities , consistent with other evidence that lobals have higher column density , dustier absorbers . </S>",
    "<S> important questions of whether balqsos represent a special line - of - sight towards a qso nucleus or rather an early evolutionary or high accretion phase in a qso lifetime remain to be resolved , and the unique properties of lobal qsos will be an integral part of that investigation . </S>"
