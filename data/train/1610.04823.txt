    "facial recognition has been an open problem in biometrics and computer vision research for decades .",
    "recently , the advent of deep learning @xcite methods such as convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) has allowed face recognition performance on hard datasets to improve significantly .",
    "for instance , google facenet  @xcite , a cnn based method , has achieved over 99% verification accuracy on the lfw dataset  @xcite , which was once considered a very challenging dataset for face recognition algorithms  @xcite . because cnns possess the ability to automatically learn complex representations of face data , they systematically outperform methods based on hand - crafted features .",
    "since these representations are learned from the data itself , it is often assumed that we must provide cnns clean , pre - processed data for training . in this work",
    ", we posed the following question : can cnns automatically learn robust representations invariant of facial pose , or does training with frontalized face images yield better results ? to reach an answer , we conducted an extensive comparative analysis of different facial pre - processing techniques .    commonly used public face datasets  @xcite contain thousands to millions of unconstrained , frequently non - frontal face images .",
    "while researchers have utilized face image frontalization as a pre - processing step before training , a thorough evaluation of the effects of frontalization on face recognition is lacking .",
    "we have tried to fill this gap by performing a wide range of facial recognition peformance comparisons using a set of different frontalization techniques .        for these experiments , we selected casia web face  @xcite as our training dataset .",
    "two frontalization techniques were chosen for our training and testing evaluation : the well - established method proposed by hassner et al .",
    "( h ) @xcite , and our own newly proposed method .",
    "to evaluate the effect of facial landmarking on the frontalization process , we used three effective landmarking techniques : the methods of zhu and ramanan ( zr )  @xcite , kazemi and sullivan ( ks )  @xcite , and a novel technique  a cascade mixture of regressors ( cmr ) .",
    "remarkably different face frontalization results obtained using various combinations of these methods on a sample image from casia - webface can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : front_ex ] .",
    "we used the popular vgg - face cnn architecture proposed in  @xcite as our base architecture for training multiple networks using different pre - processing strategies . for the testing phase , we selected the challenging pasc video dataset  @xcite .",
    "we extracted face representations from individual video frames in pasc using a network trained with a particular pre - processing strategy .",
    "these features were used for verification and recognition purposes by applying a cosine similarity score - based face matching procedure . since the focus of our study was to evaluate the effect of the pre - processing methods on cnn - based face recognition , we chose not to use any elaborate detection algorithms like those used by most of the pasc 2016 challenge participants  @xcite .",
    "as a set of baselines for network training , we used 1 ) no pre - processing at all , 2 ) a simple 2d alignment that corrects for in - plane rotation using eye centers , and 3 ) a snapshot of the vgg - face model  @xcite pre - trained on the 2d aligned vgg - face dataset .",
    "this was used to evaluate how much the additional training on casia - webface improved the face representation capability of the cnn model .",
    "the effect of each data augmentation is manifested in the performance of each subsequent cnn model .    in summary ,",
    "the contribution of this paper is two fold :    1 .",
    "we evaluate a set of popular facial landmarking and frontalization methods and quantify their effect on performance in video - based face recognition tasks using a cnn .",
    "we propose a new facial landmarking and frontalization technique for comparison .",
    "previous work relevant to this subject can be categorized into three broad groups as listed below :    * facial landmarking : * facial landmarking is an essential part of frontalization , as the landmarks define the facial co - ordinates . over the past decade ,",
    "an array of landmarking techniques have been developed that rely on handcrafted features  @xcite .",
    "recently , deep learning has been used for training and regression  @xcite .",
    "current algorithms provide landmark sets of size between 7 and 194 points .",
    "of late , landmarkers have begun to conform to a 68-point standard to improve comparative analysis between algorithms and across different landmarking challenges and datasets  @xcite .",
    "* face frontalization : * once the facial landmarks are detected on a non - frontal face , frontalization can be performed using one of the two main approaches .",
    "the first approach utilizes unique 3d models for each face in the gallery , either inferred statistically  @xcite , collected at acquisition time  @xcite , or generic  @xcite .",
    "once the image is mapped to a 3d model , matching can be performed by either reposing the gallery image to match the pose of the query image or the query image can be frontalized  @xcite .",
    "these methods have been utilized in breakthrough recognition algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the second approach uses statistical models to infer a frontal view of the face by minimizing off - pose faces to their lowest rank reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "additionally , methods have been explored for inferring frontal faces using deep learning  @xcite .    *",
    "face recognition : * face recognition has been explored by researchers for decades . in its infancy , researchers used handcrafted features and descriptors for representing faces  @xcite .",
    "more recently , state - of - the - art deep cnn methods for face recognition have achieved near - perfect recognition scores on the once - challenging lfw dataset  @xcite . while some of these methods concentrate on creating novel network architectures  @xcite , others focus on feeding a large pool of data to the network training stage  @xcite .",
    "researchers have now shifted their attention to the more challending problem of face recognition from videos .",
    "the youtube faces ( ytf ) dataset  @xcite , ijb - a  @xcite and pasc  @xcite exemplify both unconstained and controlled video settings .",
    "researchers have developed multi pose based cnn models @xcite or used face image frontalization as an data augmentation step @xcite , for recognizing faces from these challenging video datasets .",
    "here we present brief descriptions of the face landmarking and frontalization techniques used in this paper .",
    "* zhu and ramanan ( zr )  @xcite : * this method allows for simultaneous face detection , landmarking , and pose detection , accommodating up to 175 degrees of facial yaw .",
    "it uses a mixture of trees approach , similar to that of phylogenetic inference . the algorithm proposed in  @xcite",
    "is used to optimize the tree structure with maximum likelihood calculations based on training priors . due to the algorithm performing localization and landmarking concurrently , it is comparatively slow .",
    "* kazemi and sullivan ( ks )  @xcite : * this method uses a cascade of multiple regressors to estimate landmark points on the face using only a small , sparse subset of pixel intensities from the image .",
    "this unique subsampling renders it extremely fast , while maintaining a high level of accuracy .",
    "this landmarker is popular due to its ease of use and availability  it is implemented in the widely used dlib library  @xcite .",
    "* cascade mixture of regressors ( cmr ) : * we introduce this method as a fast performing alternative for facial landmarking that works well on lower - resolution images in datasets such as casia - webface and pasc .",
    "similar to the supervised descent method  @xcite , this method initializes its set of landmarks in a defined initial formation around the detected face .",
    "then a regression function in the form of a gaussian mixture of regressors is applied to local features extracted from the initial landmark locations .",
    "the landmark positions are fine - tuned iteratively using a cascade of mixture regressors similar to  @xcite .",
    "* hassner et al . ( h )  @xcite : * this method allows 2d face images to be frontalized without any prior 3d knowledge .",
    "we chose to analyze this method due to its prominence in the facial biometrics community , and because an open source implementation of the algorithm exists . using a set of reference 3d facial landmark points determined by a template 3d face model ,",
    "the 2d facial landmarks detected in an input image are projected into the 3d space .",
    "a 3d camera homography is then estimated between them .",
    "back - projection is then used to map pixel intensities from the face onto the canonical , frontal template .",
    "optional soft symmetry is then applied as a post - processing method by replacing areas of the face that are self - occluded .",
    "figure  [ fig : hassner_method ] shows the general mapping procedure for projecting non - frontal faces onto a 3d model .",
    "this method projects pixels onto the template in a global , non - piecewise manner . due to this",
    ", local artifacts from self - occlusions can get streched and smeared across a frontalized face .",
    "this can cause loss of high - frequency features used for matching .",
    "in this section , we present our proposed frontalization procedure , which is capable of synthesizing a frontalized face image from a single input image with arbitrary facial orientation without requiring a subject - specific 3d model .          our frontalization procedure starts ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : block_diag ] ( a ) ) by detecting the facial region in the input image @xmath0 using the viola - jones face detector  @xcite . using the cmr method",
    ", we detect 68 facial landmark points , i.e. , @xmath1^\\top\\in\\mathbb{r}^{2\\cdot68\\times 1}$ ] .",
    "the landmarks can be used to determine the pose and orientation of the processed face .",
    "we crop the facial area , @xmath2 , from the input image based on the detected landmarks and use it as the basis for frontalization .    to transform the face in the input image to a frontal pose",
    ", we require a depth estimate for each of the pixels in the cropped facial area . to this end",
    ", we use a generic 3d face model and fit it to the cropped image @xmath2 .",
    "our 3d model is a frontal depth image @xmath3 from the frgc dataset  @xcite manually annotated with the same 68 landmarks as detected by the cmr procedure .",
    "we fit the 3d model to the cropped image through a piece - wise warping procedure guided by the delaunay triangulation of the annotated landmarks .",
    "since the annotated landmarks reside in a 3d space , i.e. , @xmath4^\\top\\in\\mathbb{r}^{3\\cdot68\\times 1}$ ] , we use only the 2d coordinates in the xy - plane to compute the triangulation .",
    "the fitting procedure then aligns the generic 3d model with the shape of the cropped image and provides the depth information needed for the 3d transformation of the input face to a frontal pose ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : block_diag ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the depth information generated by the warping procedure represents only a rough estimate of the true values , but , as we show later , is sufficient to produce visually convincing frontalization results .",
    "after the fitting process , we use the landmarks @xmath5 corresponding to the aligned 3d model @xmath6 and the landmarks @xmath7 of the generic 3d face model to estimate a 3d transformation , @xmath8 , that maps the fitted model @xmath6 back to frontal pose ( fig .",
    "[ fig : block_diag ] ( c ) ) .",
    "we use horn s quaternion based method  @xcite to calculate the necessary scaling , rotation and translation to align the 3d points in @xmath9 and @xmath10 and construct the transformation matrix @xmath11 .",
    "any given point of the aligned 3d model @xmath12^\\top$ ] can then be mapped to a new point in 3d space based on the following expression : @xmath13 where @xmath14^\\top$ ] represents a point of the frontalized 3d model @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : block_diag ] ( d ) ) .",
    "the cropped image @xmath2 and the aligned model @xmath6 are defined over the same xy - grid .",
    "the known 2d - to-3d point correspondences can , therefore , be exploited to map the texture from the arbitrarily posed image @xmath2 to its frontalized form @xmath16 .",
    "values missing from @xmath16 after the mapping are filled in by interpolation .",
    "the results of the presented procedure are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : block_diag ] ( d ) .",
    "here , images in the the upper row illustrate the transformation of the 3d models in accordance with @xmath11 , while the lower row depicts the corresponding texture mapping .",
    "the mapped texture image @xmath16 represents an initial frontal view of the input face , but is distorted in some areas .",
    "we correct for these distortions with the postprocessing steps described in the next section .",
    "similar to the method of  @xcite , our approach utilizes a generic 3d face model to generate frontalized face images , but we adapt our model in accordance with the shape of the input face to ensure a better fit .",
    "triangulation is performed on the input face landmark coordinates .",
    "each triangle is then mapped back to the generic 3d face model , and an affine transform is calculated per - triangle . because the piecewise alignment is performed with a warping procedure , minor distortions are introduced into the shape of the aligned 3d model , which lead to artifacts in the mapped texture image @xmath16 .",
    "additional artifacts are also introduced by the interpolation procedure needed to compensate for the obscured or occluded areas in the input images caused by in - plane rotations and self - occlusions .",
    "we correct for the outlined issues by analyzing the frontalized 3d model @xmath15 .",
    "since eq .",
    "( [ eq : 3d trnasform ] ) defines a mapping from @xmath6 to @xmath15 , the frontlized 3d model @xmath15 is not necessarily defined over a rectangular grid , but in general represents a point cloud with areas of different point density .",
    "we idenitfy obscured pixels in @xmath6 based on point densities .",
    "if the density for a given pixel falls below a particular threshold , we mirror the corresponding pixel from the other side of the face to form a more symmetric face .",
    "the effect of the presented image correction procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : block_diag ] ( e ) .",
    "the image , marked as @xmath17 , contains white patches that were identified as being occluded in @xmath6 , while @xmath18 represents the corrected image with pixels mirrored from one side of the face to the other ( examine the difference in the appearance of the nostrils between @xmath16 and @xmath18 ) . in the last step of our frontalization procedure we map the image @xmath18 to a predefined mean shape .",
    "this mapping generates the final frontalized output @xmath19 of our procedure and is shown in the last image of fig .",
    "[ fig : block_diag ] ( e ) .",
    "in this section , we provide details about our face recognition pipeline .",
    "this includes the training and testing data , pre - processing methods , network architecture , and the scoring protocol .",
    "we also discuss the rationale behind choosing each component and method .",
    "a schematic representation of our pipeline can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : framework ] .",
    "the casia - webface  @xcite dataset contains 494,414 face images of 10,575 subjects , with 46 face images per subject on average .",
    "the dataset contains face images of varying gender , age , ethnicity and poses .",
    "it was originally released for training cnns and reporting performance on lfw  @xcite . in comparison , the megaface @xcite and vgg - face  @xcite datasets both contain over a million face images . however , the average number of images per subject is too low ( 1.5 ) for megaface  @xcite , and vgg - face contains many labeling errors .",
    "therefore , we decided not use either megaface or vgg - face for training . instead , we chose a subset of casia - webface , containing 303,481 face images of 7,577 subjects , as our training dataset .",
    "this subset was used instead of the whole dataset to account for time and resource constraints .",
    "sample images can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : framework ] .          the pre - processing schemes for the training data in our experiments",
    "were comprised of different combinations of landmarkers and frontalizers described in secs .",
    "[ sec : methods ] and  [ sec : vito ] - 1 ) zhu and ramanan ( zr ) and hassner et al .",
    "( h ) , 2 ) kazemi and sullivan ( ks ) and hassner et al .",
    "( h ) , and 3 ) cmr and our frontalization method .",
    "output of the frontalization techniques on sample images can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : frontalization_matrix ] .",
    "in addition , we compared these methods to three baseline approaches : 1 ) training vgg - face with only 2d aligned casia - webface images , rotated using eye - centers , _",
    "i.e. _ no frontalization ( figure [ fig : front_ex].b ) .",
    "2 ) training vgg - face with original casia - webface images , _ i.e. _ no pre - processing .",
    "3 ) instead of training our own version of the vgg - face model , we used a pre - trained snapshot of the vgg - face model as a feature extractor _",
    "i.e. _ , no additional training .",
    "this snapshot was trained with 2d aligned face images from the vgg - face dataset .",
    "the last baseline method was used to evaluate how much the additional training on casia - webface improved the face representation capability of the vgg - face cnn model .",
    "the cnn architecture in this work is similar to the one described by parkhi et al .",
    "@xcite , a variant of the 16 layer model proposed by simonyan and zisserman  @xcite .",
    "the architecture is comprised of linear convolution layers with non - linear operators including relu and max pooling filters in between the convolutional layers .",
    "these are followed by three fully connected ( fc ) layers with a filter size that is the same as the input image ( 224@xmath20224 ) .",
    "the first two fc layers ( denoted as _",
    "fc6 _ and _ fc7 _ ) are 4,096 dimensional , while the size of the final fc layer ( _ fc8 _ ) depends on the number of classes in the training data .",
    "the reasons for choosing this particular 16 layer architecture are three - fold : 1 ) it generates verification results comparable to google facenet @xcite on lfw @xcite while requiring a fraction of its training data . 2 ) the model does reasonably well in identifying faces from ytf @xcite videos .",
    "3 ) a snapshot of this model , pre - trained on 2 million face images , is present in the caffe  @xcite model zoo .",
    "we used this pre - trained model to fine - tune connection weights in our training experiments for faster convergence @xcite .",
    "the pasc dataset  @xcite is a collection of videos acquired at the university of notre dame over seven weeks in the spring semester of 2011 .",
    "the human subjects in each video clip performed different pre - determined action each week .",
    "the actions were captured using two cameras ( handeld and tripod mounted ) simultaneously .",
    "the handheld videos were acquired with five different cameras , while tripod mounted videos were shot with the same camera .",
    "the dataset contains 1,401 videos from handheld cameras and 1,401 videos from the tripod mounted camera .",
    "a small training set of 280 videos is also available with the dataset .    while both ytf @xcite and ijb - a @xcite are well - established video datasets , they are collections of video data from the internet . on the other hand ,",
    "pasc solely consists of video sequences physically collected specifically for the task of video face recognition .",
    "this type of controlled acquisition is beneficial for our video - to - video matching - based evaluation .",
    "we used networks trained on data pre - processed with each of the combinations mentioned above as feature extractors for pasc video frames .",
    "the face region from each frame was extracted beforehand using the bounding box provided with the dataset .",
    "bad detections were filtered out by taking the default track coordinates of the faces and removing detections that were outside a 2.5 sigma distance range from the assumed face track .",
    "after this pruning process , a total of 1,348 and 1,378 videos were left for tripod - mounted and handheld videos respectively .",
    "we used our simple 2d - alignment using eye centers to align the pasc dataset .",
    "different preprocessing methods lead to significantly different pasc testing set yields . to keep a uniform testing set for all experiments , the 2d - aligned pasc data was used for testing on all cnns trained with different preprocessing methods    a 4,096 dimensional feature vecture",
    "was then extraced at the _ fc7 _ layer for every face image using each cnn model .",
    "once all feature vectors for all frames were collected , we computed the accumulated feature - wise means at each dimension to generate a single representative vector for that video .",
    "this accumulated vector can be represented as [ _ @xmath21 _ , _ @xmath22 _ , _ @xmath23 _ , ... , _ @xmath24 _ ] , such that    @xmath25    where _ @xmath26 _ is the @xmath27-th feature in frame _ i _ of the video and _",
    "n _ is the total number of frames in that video .",
    "once we had the representative vector for all the videos , we used cosine similarity to compute match scores between different accumulated feature vectors from two different videos , as shown below :    @xmath28    where _",
    "s(u , v ) _ is the similarity score between the two vectors _ u _ = [ _ @xmath21 _ , _ @xmath22 _ , _ @xmath23 _ , ... , _ @xmath24 _ ] and _ v _ = [ _ @xmath21 _ , _ @xmath22 _ , _ @xmath23 _ , ... , _ @xmath24 _ ] .",
    "u _ and _ v _ are perfectly alike ( 0 angle ) , then _ s(u , v ) _ is 1 .",
    "ideally , two videos ( vectors ) of the same subject should generate a cosine similarity score of approximately 1 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a true match .",
    "cosine similarity is a common scoring approach for video - to - video matching , and we chose to use it here because of its prevelance in the 2016 pasc challenge  @xcite .",
    "these similarity scores were used for calculating the verification and identification accuracy rates of each cnn .",
    "here we present details about our experiments and the subsequent results .      to analyze the effect that facial frontalization has on recognition performance , we performed two experiments : 1 ) training vgg - face with face images pre - processed with different strategies , then analyzing its performance on only the 2d aligned pasc dataset , _",
    "i.e. _ , frontalization at training time , and 2 ) frontalizing the pasc dataset as well _ i.e. _ , frontalization both at training and testing time .    for each frontalization method , we kept two pre - processed versions of the same face : one without any symmetry ( asymmetric ) , such as the lefthand side of figure  [ fig : front_ex ] ( c ) , and the other with symmetry , where one vertical half is used for both sides of the face , as in the righthand side of figure  [ fig : front_ex ] ( c ) .",
    "for the symmetric versions , the half to replicate was chosen automatically based on the quality of the facial landmark points .",
    "however , for our own pre - processing method , we decided to replicate only the left half of the face for the symmetric version ( hard - symmetry ) , as shown in the right part of figure  [ fig : front_ex ] ( e ) .",
    "this was done to evaluate the effect of the automatic quality based replication process , used for the other two frontalization strategies .",
    "many samples in casia - webface proved difficult to calculate landmark detections due to scale , extreme pose , or occlusion .",
    "these samples were disgarded from the training set ; subsequently , most pre - processing methods yielded an image count well below the total number of images originally in the dataset .",
    "the yield of frontalized faces varied for each combination as can be seen in table [ tab : methodyield ] .",
    "|c | c| c|    .yield of each pre - processing method [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     & 85.96 +    [ tab : methodyield ]    we trained a vgg - face model separately for each set of training data pre - processed with a given method . for each method , we randomly split 80% of the casia - webface data into training and the rest into validation sets .",
    "a single nvidia titan x gpu was used to run all of our training experiments using the caffe  @xcite deep learning package .",
    "network weights were initialized from a snapshot of vgg - face pre - trained on 2 million face images  @xcite .",
    "we used stochastic gradient descent @xcite for cnn training .",
    "the hyperparameters for this method were selected using the hyperopt software package  @xcite .",
    "once one set of hyperparameters was calculated , the same set was repeated across the different experiments to maintain consistency .",
    "the base learning rate was set to 0.01 , which was multiplied by a factor of 0.1 ( gamma ) following a stepwise learning policy , with a step size set to 50,000 training iterations .",
    "the training batch size was set to 64 , where the training image resolution was 224@xmath20224 for the vgg - face model .",
    "we set a hard bound of 50 epochs , after which training was terminated .",
    "convergence was reached within the 50 epochs for all the different training regimes .",
    "the snapshot at 50 epochs was then used for feature extraction in the testing phase .              for the first set of experiments",
    ", we used 2d aligned face images from extracted from pasc videos .",
    "we did two tests on the tripod - mounted and handheld images separately .",
    "each experiment consisted of two parts : 1 ) we computed the verification accuracy using a roc curve , as done traditionally on pasc .",
    "2 ) we computed the rank - based recongition accuracy , _",
    "i.e. _ , identification using a cmc curve .",
    "we felt both verification and identification performance measures were pertinent in analyzing the behavior of each frontalization scheme .",
    "for the handheld data , the identification and verification performance of the different cnn models can be seen in figures [ fig : cmc_handheld ] and [ fig : roc_handheld ] respectively .",
    "the vgg - face model trained on 2d aligned face images outperformed every other pre - processing and baseline method .",
    "the asymmetric version of the kazemi and sullivan ( ks ) and hassner et al .",
    "( h ) combination performed the best among the different frontalization techniques .",
    "interestingly , our frontalization method performed worst among the pre - processing methods , although face images frontalized using it look natural to the human eye .",
    "we suspect the warping mechanism in our frontalization method to be responsible for this .",
    "however , note that it is much better than doing no preprocessing whatsoever  a dominant mode of operation for cnn - based face recognition .    to evaluate the effect of frontalization at the time of testing , we frontalized faces extracted from the pasc frames using the asymmetric version of the ks and h combination .",
    "this was the best frontalization combination from the first set of experiments .",
    "however , the yield was poor for frontalization - only 1074 handheld and 1166 tripod mounted of the 1401 pasc videos had at least one frontalized frame of sufficient quality .",
    "vgg - face models trained on this combination and the three baselines were used for feature extraction . the identification and verification performance of these models can be found in figures  [ fig : cmc_handheld_front ] and  [ fig : roc_handheld_front ] respectively . as can be seen ,",
    "the cnn trained with 2d aligned images does nearly well as that trained with frontalized images .",
    "several key observations can be drawn from our experiments and used inform future face recognition experiments :      \\2 ) a simple 2d alignment procedure is a computationally cheaper pre - processing option for face images used to train cnns , compared to face image frontalization .",
    "features extracted using a cnn trained with 2d aligned face images yield better recognition accuracy than a cnn trained with frontalized face images when the face images used for testing are not frontalized .",
    "\\3 ) frontalizing both the training and testing face images , although computationally much more expensive , does not significantly improve the recognition performance when compared to a simple 2d alignment process .",
    "\\4 ) asymmetrically frontalized face images tend to boost a cnn s face representation capability slightly when compared with symmetrically frontalized faces .",
    "our experiments also showed that setting a hard symmetry function , _",
    "i.e. _ , always replicating one particular half of the face , generates visually unnatural results . and training a cnn with these unnaturally frontalized faces might even hamper its face representation capability .",
    "\\5 ) results generated from one frontalization method might look superior to the human eye than the results generated from another frontalization method .",
    "however , that does not guarantee that a cnn trained with face images frontalized using the first method will represent faces better than a cnn trained with face images frontalized using the second .",
    "in fact , its performance might dip in some cases .",
    "for example , the face images frontalized using the kazemi and sullivan and hassner et al .",
    "method looked far less realistic than those frontalized with cmr and our method but the vgg - face model trained on face images frontalized with the first method generated far better results than the second method .",

    "<S> automatic face recognition performance has improved remarkably in the last decade . </S>",
    "<S> much of this success can be attributed to the development of deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) . </S>",
    "<S> but the training process for cnns requires a large amount of clean and well - labelled training data . </S>",
    "<S> if a cnn is intended to work with non - frontal face images , should this training data be diverse in terms of facial poses , or should face images be frontalized as a pre - processing step ? </S>",
    "<S> we address this question in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate a set of popular facial landmarking and pose frontalization algorithms to understand their effect on facial recognition performance . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce a new automatic frontalization scheme that operates over a single image without the need for a subject - specific 3d model , and perform a comparative analysis between the new scheme and other methods in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> a cnn trained on face images frontalized using different pre - processing methods is used to extract features from the point and shoot challenge ( pasc ) video dataset . </S>",
    "<S> the verification and identification performance of the cnn serves to quantify the effectiveness of each landmarking and frontalization scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we find that frontalization , although an intuitive pre - processing strategy , does not significantly improve face recognition performance when compared with a simple 2d face alignment . </S>"
