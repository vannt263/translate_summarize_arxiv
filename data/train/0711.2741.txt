    "the primary utilitarian motivation for supersymmetry being accessible to experiments at the electroweak scale , e.g. , at the lhc , depends on its ability to alleviate the problem of fine - tuning of electroweak symmetry breaking present in the standard model @xcite .",
    "a supplementary phenomenological motivation for weak - scale supersymmetry is its ability to provide the cold dark matter required by astrophysics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "this is a natural feature of supersymmetric models that conserve r parity , with the lightest neutralino @xmath7 being particularly well - suited to provide the preferred amount of cold dark matter if it is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and weighs less than about 1  tev @xcite . within the general supersymmetric framework ,",
    "one may find more plausible regions of the supersymmetric parameter space that are less fine - tuned , in the sense that the values of the model parameters chosen at some high input scale require less delicate adjustment in order to obtain the correct value of the electroweak scale @xcite , as measured by @xmath8 , or the correct value of the cold dark matter density @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is hard to make this type of plausibility argument at all rigorous : it is notoriously difficult to make probabilistic statements about the unique ( by definition ) universe in which we live , it is largely a matter of personal choice which derived quantity one should consider and which input parameters one wishes to avoid fine - tuning , it is difficult to argue conclusively for the superiority of one measure of fine - tuning over any other , and even less easy to agree on a ` pain threshold ' in the amount of fine - tuning one is prepared to tolerate @xcite . nevertheless , within a given model framework with its specific input parameters ,",
    "it is legitimate to consider some important derived quantity such as @xmath9 , and compare the amounts of fine - tuning required in different regions of its parameter space , which frequently do not depend very sensitively on the specific sensitivity measure employed .",
    "moreover , even if one does not accept that the less sensitive parameter regions are more plausible , measuring the dark matter fine - tuning may have other uses .",
    "for example , one hopes ( expects ) some day to discover supersymmetry and start to measure the values of its parameters .",
    "unavoidably , these will have non - negligible measurement errors , and these uncertainties propagate via the dark matter fine - tuning parameters into the calculation , e.g. , of @xmath9 .",
    "one of the key features of supersymmetry is its ability to provide a calculable amount of cold dark matter , and it is interesting to know how accurately which of its parameters must be measured in order to calculate @xmath9 with an accuracy comparable to that quoted by astrophysicists and cosmologists @xcite .",
    "an accurate calculation of @xmath9 might also reveal some deficiency of the supersymmetric explanation of the cold dark matter , and possibly the need for some other new physics in addition .",
    "it is important to note that the parameters we refer to here are the gut - scale soft supersymmetry - breaking masses and couplings , whereas experiments would measure directly physical masses and mixings at much lower energies .",
    "ideally , one would calculate the relic density directly from the low - energy measurements of mssm parameters .",
    "however it will be difficult , if not impossible , to pin down all the key parameters using lhc data alone , except by making supplementary assumptions about the pattern of supersymmetry breaking at the gut scale , as we do here .",
    "assuming a structure of gut - scale unification , one may use experimental measurements to constrain these fewer high - energy parameters .",
    "the strength of the constraints will depend on the magnitudes of these parameters and the experimental tools available .",
    "very likely some accelerator beyond the lhc will be needed , but we do not yet know what will be available .",
    "the fine - tuning measures we calculate here show clearly which of the high - energy parameters are most important for a precise calculation of the relic density , and hence contribute to the ` wish list ' for such an accelerator .    for these reasons",
    ", we make no further apologies for considering the fine - tuning of @xmath9 in this paper , which we shall refer to as `` dark matter fine - tuning '' @xcite to distinguish it from the more commonly studied `` electroweak fine - tuning '' @xcite , which we also consider for completeness .",
    "the issue of dark matter fine - tuning has been considered previously in the context of several different models including the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( cmssm ) @xcite , in which the soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar masses @xmath10 , gaugino masses @xmath11 and trilinear parameters @xmath12 are each assumed to be universal , a more general mssm with non - universal third family scalars and gaugino masses @xcite , a string - inspired non - universal model @xcite and susy guts with non - universal gaugino masses @xcite . here",
    "we extend such considerations to models with non - universal soft supersymmetry - breaking contributions to the higgs masses ( nuhm ) . within this nuhm framework ,",
    "the independent input parameters may be taken as @xcite @xmath13 and we take as our measure of dark matter fine - tuning the quantity @xmath14 our objective will be three - fold : to compare the amount of dark matter fine - tuning required within the nuhm to that required within the cmssm , to identify the regions of the nuhm parameter space that require relatively less ( or more ) dark matter fine - tuning , and thereby to quantify the accuracy in the determination of the gut - scale nuhm parameters that would be needed in order to calculate @xmath15 with any desired accuracy .    the regions of the nuhm parameter space where @xmath16 falls within the range favoured by wmap and other experiments has been studied quite extensively , for example in @xcite .",
    "it shares several features in common with the more restrictive cmssm framework proposed in @xcite and extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "for example , there are regions where @xmath7 - stau coannihilation is important , and others where @xmath7 pairs annihilate rapidly via direct - channel @xmath17 poles .",
    "however , other possibilities also occur .",
    "for example , there are regions where @xmath7 - sneutrino coannihilation is dominant .",
    "also there are regions where rapid - annihilation and bulk regions , which are normally separated by a coannihilation strip , approach each other and may even merge . as we discuss below in more detail ,",
    "the sneutrino coannihilation regions exhibit relatively high dark matter fine - tuning , whereas the ` merger ' regions may require significantly less dark matter fine - tuning .    in this work",
    "we provide a first calculation of the dark matter fine - tuning for the regions of the nuhm that are favoured by dark matter measurements .",
    "in addition , we present a first calculation of the electroweak fine - tuning within this model and update the parameter scans for the current measurement of the top mass .",
    "the rest of the paper is laid out as follows . in section  [ sec : methods ] we summarise the methods used in our numerical studies . next , in section  [ cmssm ] we review the familiar case of the cmssm , which serves as a baseline for later comparison .",
    "then , in section  [ nuhm ] we study dark matter within the nuhm model in which universality between the soft supersymmetry - breaking masses of the sfermions ( squarks and sleptons ) and higgs multiplets is broken .",
    "finally , in section  [ conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in order to study the low - energy phenomenology of the nuhm , we need a tool to run the mass spectrum from the gut scale down to the electroweak scale using the renormalisation group equations ( rges)@xcite . for this purpose",
    "we use the rge code softsusy  @xcite .",
    "this interfaces with the mssm package within micromegas  @xcite , which we use to calculate the dark matter relic density @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we take @xmath21  gev throughout .      after running the mass spectrum of any chosen model parameter set from the gut scale down to the electroweak scale",
    ", we perform a number of checks on the phenomenological acceptability of the point chosen .",
    "a point is ruled out if :    1",
    ".   it does not provide radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) .",
    "such regions are displayed in light red in the subsequent figures .",
    "it violates the bounds on particle masses provided by the tevatron and lep  2 .",
    "such regions are displayed in light blue  gev .",
    "however , there is a theoretical uncertainty of some @xmath22  gev in the determination of the mass of the light higgs  @xcite . rather than placing a hard cut on the parameter space for the higgs mass , instead we plot a line at @xmath23  gev and",
    "colour the region in which @xmath24  gev in very light grey - blue . ] .",
    "it results in a lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) that is not the lightest neutralino .",
    "we colour these regions light green .    in the remaining parameter space",
    "we display the 1- and 2-@xmath25 regions for @xmath20 and @xmath19 , as well as plotting the 2-@xmath25 region for the relic density allowed by wmap and other observations .",
    "present measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath26 deviate from theoretical calculations of the sm contribution based on low - energy @xmath27 data   data , or with @xmath28 decay data .",
    "the weight of evidence indicates the @xmath29 estimate is more reliable so we use the @xmath27 value in our work . ] . taking the current experimental world average and the state - of - the - art sm value from  @xcite",
    ", there is a discrepancy : @xmath30 which amounts to a 3.4-@xmath25 deviation from the sm value .",
    "as already mentioned , we use micromegas to calculate the susy contribution to @xmath31 .",
    "the dominant theoretical errors in this calculation are in the sm contribution , so in our analysis we neglect the theoretical error in the calculation of the susy contribution .",
    "the variation of @xmath19 from the value predicted by the standard model is highly sensitive to susy contributions arising from charged higgs - top loops and chargino - stop loops . to date",
    "no deviation from the standard model has been detected .",
    "we take the current world average from  @xcite , based on the belle  @xcite , cleo  @xcite and babar  @xcite measurements : @xmath32 again , we use micromegas to calculate both the sm value of @xmath19 and the susy contributions .",
    "it is hard to estimate the theoretical uncertainty in the calculation of the susy contributions , but note that there is an uncertainty of @xmath33 in the nlo sm prediction of @xmath19  @xcite   to nlo .",
    "a first estimate of the sm prediction of @xmath19 to nnlo was presented in  @xcite .",
    "this showed a decrease of around @xmath34 in the central value of the sm prediction .",
    "the implementation of the nnlo contributions in the calculation is non - trivial and its implementation in micromegas is currently underway . as a result",
    "we do not include this decrease in the results we present , but instead note that _ positive _ susy contributions to @xmath19 look likely to be favoured in future .",
    "this would favour a negative sign of @xmath35 and thus cause tension with @xmath31 . ] . as with @xmath20",
    ", we plot the 1-@xmath25 and 2-@xmath25 experimental ranges , and do not include a theoretical error in the calculation .",
    "evidence from the cosmic microwave background , the rotation curves of galaxies and other astrophysical data point to a large amount of cold non - baryonic dark matter in the universe .",
    "the present measurements  @xcite indicate the following value for the current cold dark matter density : @xmath36 we calculate the relic dark matter density with micromegas using the _ fast _ approximation .",
    "given a low - energy mass spectrum , micromegas gives an estimated precision of @xmath37 in the theoretical prediction of the relic density .",
    "this is negligible compared to the present observational error , so the 2-@xmath25 band plotted takes into account only the experimental error   accuracy is for a given low - energy spectrum , which is obtained using softsusy .",
    "however , there are differences in the details of the mass spectrum between codes  @xcite , for given high - energy inputs , and different dark matter regions have different levels of sensitivity to these variations : see  @xcite for a detailed study .",
    "the result of the discrepancies between codes is to move the dark matter regions slightly in the gut scale parameter space",
    ". as we are interested in broad features of these regions , rather than their precise locations , these uncertainties are not important for our purposes . ] .    in the following sections , we calculate the dark - matter fine - tuning for any point that lies within the @xmath38 allowed region , and",
    "indicate the amount using colour coding .",
    "we also display electroweak fine - tuning contours over the different regions .",
    "we first review the familiar constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) @xcite . which serves as a standard to which we compare the parameter space of the nuhm .",
    "the cmssm has a much simpler spectrum of soft masses than the full mssm .",
    "first , all of the soft squark and slepton ( mass)@xmath5 matrices are chosen to be diagonal and universal at the gut scale with the diagonal entries equal to @xmath39 . secondly both the soft higgs ( mass)@xmath5 are also set equal to @xmath39 .",
    "additionally , all the gaugino masses are assumed to be unified with a value @xmath11 at the gut scale .",
    "finally , we take the trilinear coupling matrices to have only one non - zero entry ( the third - family dominance approximation ) and assume that all these entries are equal to a common value @xmath12 . requiring",
    "that electroweak symmetry be broken radiatively to give the observed electroweak boson masses , we trade the soft parameters @xmath35 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 , the ratio of the higgs vevs , and the sign of @xmath35 .",
    "this results in a model with four free parameters and a sign : @xmath42 although our main focus is the dark - matter fine - tuning , we also report the required amounts of electroweak fine - tuning for specific cases of interest .",
    "-0.5 cm    in fig .",
    "[ f : cmssm , t10 ] we show the @xmath43 plane of the cmssm for @xmath44 and sign@xmath45 positive . at low @xmath10 the parameter space is ruled out because @xmath46 , resulting in a stau lsp ( light green ) .",
    "regions at low @xmath11 are ruled out by lep  2 bounds on the masses of the charginos and sleptons ( light blue ) . a larger range of @xmath10 is ruled out by the absence of a light higgs boson , and we shade the region with @xmath47  gev ( light grey with a black boundary ) .",
    "finally , the model fits the current @xmath20 measurement for low @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath48 and @xmath38 bounds are shown as a short and long - dashed green lines respectively . at larger @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the susy contribution becomes small as the sparticles that contribute in loops become heavy .",
    "therefore @xmath49 favours relatively light soft masses .    in the remainder of the parameter space",
    "we find the regions that fit the wmap strip at @xmath38 , and for each such point we calculate the fine - tuning of the dark matter density .",
    "each point is then plotted with a colour that corresponds to the value of the tuning via the log - scale on the right hand side .",
    ".a summary of the properties of points a1 and a2 , shown in fig .",
    "[ f : cmssm , t10 ] , chosen as representatives of the bulk region ( a1 ) and stau - coannihilation region ( a2 ) .",
    "we also present a breakdown of the dark - matter and electroweak fine - tunings with respect to each parameter of the cmssm , except for @xmath12 , which we fix : @xmath50 here and elsewhere in this paper.[t : cmssm , t10 ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     -0.5 cm    we summarize in table  [ t : nuhmtunings ] the ranges of dark matter fine - tunings found in the different dark matter regions appearing in the nuhm , which may be compared to those found previously in the cmssm , as shown in tables  [ t : cmssm , t10],[t : cmssm ] and summarised in table  [ t : cmssmtunings ] .",
    "comparing first the bulk regions , which require the smallest amounts of dark matter fine - tuning in both the cmssm and the nuhm , we see that cmssm point a2 has a low amount of dark matter fine - tuning that is at the end of the range found in the nuhm",
    ". however , point a2 has too small a value of @xmath51 , and hence is not acceptable , whereas the nuhm can circumvent this restriction .",
    "thus , _ the nuhm provides access to dark matter which is less fine - tuned than in the cmssm_. turning then to the @xmath52 coannihilation regions , we see that the nuhm offers an option of lower fine - tuning than that found in the cmssm at point a5 . for reasons explained earlier in the text ,",
    "there are very large variations in the amounts of dark matter fine - tuning required in the pseudoscalar higgs funnel region of the nuhm , and the amount found at the cmssm point a4 lies within this range . in addition , the nuhm contains a region in which a bino / higgsino lsp annihilates via a pseudoscalar higgs boson that requires dramatically less fine - tuning than the pseudoscalar funnel in the cmssm .",
    "likewise , nuhm analogues of the focus points a3 and a6 shown in table  [ t : cmssm ] require dark matter fine - tunings that are substantially less than in the cmssm .",
    "one new region appears in the nuhm that has no cmssm analogue , namely the @xmath1 coannihilation region . at least in the examples",
    "studied , this requires rather more dark matter fine - tuning than the @xmath0 coannihilation region .",
    "although it was not the primary focus of this paper , we have also calculated the electroweak fine - tuning across the nuhm parameter space , and found it to be of the same order of magnitude as in other mssm studies .",
    "generally speaking , the fact that the nuhm has more parameters offers more possibilities to find regions with particularly small ( or large ) dark matter fine - tunings .",
    "the smaller amounts of dark matter fine - tuning generally occur in regions where several different ( co)annihilation processes contribute to the final dark matter density , e.g. , where a bino / higgsino band meets a stau coannihilation region .",
    "conversely , there are instances where a tight correlation is necessary between two _ a priori _ independent mssm parameters , such as the stau and neutralino masses along a coannihilation strip , which is imposed automatically in the lower - dimensional parameter space of the cmssm , resulting in smaller amount of dark matter fine - tuning than might otherwise have been expected .",
    "there have been several studies of the implications of prospective lhc and/or ilc measurements for the accuracy with which the astrophysical dark matter density could be calculated on the basis of collider measurements@xcite .",
    "these studies have emphasized relatively favourable points in the cmssm coannihilation region at low @xmath11 , where the dark matter fine - tuning is relatively low and the prospective collider measurements relatively accurate .",
    "our analysis offers some prognosis as to which nuhm regions might be favourable for extensions of these analyses . clearly ,",
    "the presence of nuhm points with low dark matter fine - tuning and relatively light sparticles is encouraging _",
    "a priori_. however , we note that in general the nuhm relic density is sensitive to the separate and independent values of the soft higgs masses @xmath53",
    ". detailed consideration of their determinations using collider data has not yet been given , as far as we know , and we recall that the prospects for measuring directly the masses of the heavier higgs bosons at the lhc and ilc are limited , though the prospects of the latter would be improved with the @xmath54 option , or by going to higher energies as at clic .    the extension of these collider dark matter studies to the nuhm is a large task that lies beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , this exploratory study has revealed some of the prospective opportunities and pitfalls .",

    "<S> we study the amounts of fine - tuning of the parameters of the mssm with non - universal soft supersymmetry - breaking contributions to the higgs masses ( the nuhm ) that would be required for the relic neutralino density to lie within the range favoured by wmap and other astrophysical and cosmological observations . </S>",
    "<S> such dark matter fine - tuning is analogous to the commonly studied electroweak fine - tuning associated with satisfying the electroweak symmetry breaking conditions , which we also study for completeness . </S>",
    "<S> we identify several distinct regions of the nuhm parameter space : a bulk region , a @xmath0 coannihilation region , a pseudoscalar higgs funnel region , a focus - point bino / higgsino region and a @xmath1 coannihilation region . within each region </S>",
    "<S> , we analyse specific representative points for which we provide breakdowns of the contributions to the dark matter fine - tuning associated with the different nuhm parameters . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the nuhm offers points with both smaller and larger amounts of dark matter fine - tuning than points in the corresponding regions of the cmssm . </S>",
    "<S> lower amounts of dark matter fine - tuning typically arise at points where several different ( co)annihilation processes contribute , e.g. , at junctions between regions with different dominant processes . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on the prospects for using collider measurements to estimate the likely dark matter density within the nuhm framework .    </S>",
