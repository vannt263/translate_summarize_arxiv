    "together , negative and positive results demonstrate that the choice of a nonparametric prior is a sensitive one that leaves room for unintended consequences unless due care is taken .    this lesson must also be taken seriously when one asks the question whether the marginal posterior for the parameter of interest in a semiparametric estimation problem displays bernstein - von  mises - type limiting behaviour . in this paper ,",

    "assertion ( [ eq : assertbvm ] ) ( roughly ) implies efficiency of point - estimators like the posterior median , mode or mean and justifies asymptotic identification of credible regions with efficient confidence regions ( see section  [ sec : eff ] ) . from a practical point of view",
    ", the latter conclusion has an important implication : whereas , in many semiparametric estimation problems , it is hard to calculate optimal semiparametric confidence regions directly , simulation of a large sample from the marginal posterior ( _ e.g. _  by mcmc techniques , see robert ( 2001 ) @xcite and many others ) is sometimes comparatively straightforward .",
    "instances of the bernstein - von  mises limit have been studied in various semiparametric models ; we mention references of a general nature and several model - specific discussions .",
    "the first general reference in this area is shen ( 2002 ) @xcite with application to partial linear regression , but his conditions appear hard to verify in other examples .",

    "many of those methods are model - specific and do not lend themselves to generalization ( especially the gaussian sequence model with a gaussian prior has received a very large amount of attention ) .",
    "questions remain and a coherent , unified point of view has not been established .",
    "for that reason the perspective of paper does not provide a comprehensive account of possible approaches to the bayesian semiparametric problem ; instead it is based primarily on the perspective of @xcite .",
    "we review the theory of efficient estimation in smooth parametric and semiparametric models and discuss the derivation of the semiparametric bernstein - von  mises theorem in locally asymptotically normal @xcite and locally asymptotically exponential @xcite problems . to enhance applicability , a new version of the regular semiparametric bernstein - von  mises theorem",
    "is formulated : where , previously , the construction depended on the existence of a smooth least - favourable submodel , the new version only requires that the model permits a sequence of submodels that approximate least - favourable directions in a suitable way ( see subsection  [ sub : approx ] ) . where proofs change , full details are provided ( see subsection  [ sub : ilan ] and section  [ sec : proofs ] ) .",

    "credible sets_. typically , confidence sets are defined as neighbourhoods of an estimator with a certain coverage probability , based on the quantiles of its _ sampling distribution_. credible sets represent the same concept in bayesian statistics and are defined with the posterior in the role of the sampling distribution . in what follows",
    "we shall not be too strict in bayesian , subjectivist orthodoxy and interpret the posterior as a frequentist device , asking the natural question how its credible sets compare to confidence sets . since confidence sets and credible sets are conceptually so close , could it be that they are close also mathematically ? to answer this question , we briefly review the modern theory of ( point-)estimation of smooth parameters to arrive at a notion of asymptotic inferential optimality and we discuss the bernstein - von  mises theorem ( theorem  [ thm : truebvm ] below ) which demonstrates asymptotic equivalence of credible sets and optimal ( or _ efficient _ ) confidence sets .",
