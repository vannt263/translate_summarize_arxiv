    "pre - lie algebra structures appear in various domains of mathematics : differential geometry , quantum field theory , differential equations .",
    "they have been studied intensively recently ; we refer e.g. to the survey papers : @xcite .",
    "free pre - lie algebras had already been studied as early as 1981 by a. agrachev and r. v. gamkrelidze in their joint work `` _ _ chronological algebras and nonstationary vector fields _ _ '' @xcite , and also by d. segal in @xcite . in particular , both papers give a construction of monomial bases , with different approaches .",
    "besides , rooted trees are a classical topic , closely connected to pre - lie algebras .",
    "they appeared for example in the study of _ vector fields _",
    "@xcite , _ numerical analysis _",
    "@xcite , and more recently in _ quantum field theory _ @xcite .",
    "bases for free pre - lie algebras in terms of rooted trees were introduced by f. chapoton and m. livernet in @xcite , using the point of view of operads .",
    "a. dzhumadildaev and c. lfwall described independently two bases for free pre - lie algebras , one using the concept of rooted trees , and the other obtained by considering a basis for the free ( non - associative ) algebra modulo the pre - lie relation @xcite . + in our paper , we study free pre - lie algebras .",
    "we describe an explicit method for finding suitable monomial bases for them : recall that the space @xmath0 spanned by ( non - planar ) rooted trees forms with the grafting operation @xmath1 the free pre - lie algebra with one generator @xcite .",
    "a monomial in the free pre - lie algebra with one generator is a parenthesized word built up from the generator @xmath2 and the pre - lie grafting operation @xmath1 , for example : @xmath3    we are interested in particular monomial bases which will be called `` tree - grounded '' . to each monomial",
    "we can associate a `` lower - energy term '' by replacing the grafting operation `` @xmath4 '' by the butcher product `` @xmath5 '' . a monomial basis of @xmath6 will be called `` tree - grounded '' if the lower - energy terms of each monomial give back the chapoton - livernet tree basis of @xmath6 .",
    "we show that tree - grounded monomial bases are in one - to - one correspondence with choices @xmath7 of a planar representative for each tree @xmath8 .",
    "we give an explicit expression for the coefficients of these monomials in the basis of rooted trees , thus exhibiting a square matrix @xmath9\\!]_{s,\\,t\\in\\cal{t}_{\\!\\!n}}^{}$ ] for each degree @xmath10 .",
    "+ this paper consists in two main sections : section [ section 1 ] contains some preliminaries on planar and non - planar rooted trees , butcher products and grafting products . in this section , we also review the joint work of k. ebrahimi - fard and d. manchon ( unpublished ) who described an explicit algebra isomorphism @xmath11 between two structures of free magmatic algebras defined on the space @xmath12 of all planar rooted trees , by the left butcher product @xmath13 and the left grafting product @xmath14 respectively .",
    "we give the explicit expression of the coefficients @xmath15 of this isomorphism in the planar rooted tree basis . using their work , and by defining a bijective linear map @xmath16 which depends on the choice of a section @xmath17 of the `` forget planarity '' projection @xmath18 alluded to above , we find a formula for the coefficients @xmath19 of @xmath16 in the ( non - planar ) rooted tree basis .",
    "this can be visualized on the following diagram : for any homogeneous components @xmath20 and @xmath21 . + in section [ free pre - lie algebra ] , we recall some basic topics on free pre - lie algebras .",
    "we describe the construction of a monomial basis for each homogeneous subspace @xmath22 in free pre - lie algebras @xmath23 generated by a ( non - empty ) set @xmath24 , using a type of algebra isomorphism obtained by a. agrachev and r. v. gamkrelidze @xcite .",
    "finally , the constructions in sections [ section 1 ] and [ free pre - lie algebra ] can be related as follows : we show that a tree - grounded monomial basis in a free pre - lie algebra defines a section @xmath17 of the projection @xmath25 and , conversely , that any section of @xmath18 defines a tree - grounded monomial basis .",
    "in graph theory , a tree is a undirected connected graph together with vertices connected with each other , without cycles , by simple paths called edges @xcite .",
    "a rooted tree is defined as a tree with one designated vertex called the root .",
    "the other remaining vertices are partitioned into @xmath26 disjoint subsets such that each of them in turn represents a rooted tree , and a subtree of the whole tree .",
    "this can be taken as a recursive definition for rooted trees , widely used in computer algorithms @xcite .",
    "rooted trees stand among the most important structures appearing in many branches of pure and applied mathematics .",
    "+ in general , a tree structure can be described as a `` branching '' relationship between vertices , much like that found in the trees of nature .",
    "many types of trees defined by all sorts of constraints on properties of vertices appear to be of interest in combinatorics and in related areas such as formal logic and computer science .",
    "a planar binary tree is a finite oriented tree embedded in the plane , such that each internal vertex has exactly two incoming edges and one outgoing edge .",
    "one of the internal vertices , called the root , is a distinguished vertex with two incoming edges and one edge , like a tail at the bottom , not ending at a vertex .",
    "the incoming edges in this type of trees are internal ( connecting two internal vertices ) , or external ( with one free end ) .",
    "the external incoming edges are called the leaves .",
    "we give here some examples of planar binary trees : @xmath27 where the single edge `` @xmath28 '' is the unique planar binary tree without internal vertices .",

    "+ define the grafting operation `` @xmath31 '' on the space @xmath30 to be the operation that maps any planar binary trees @xmath32 into a new planar binary tree `` @xmath33 '' , which takes the @xmath34-shaped tree @xmath35 replacing the left ( respectively the right ) branch by @xmath36 ( respectively @xmath37 ) , see the following examples : @xmath38    let @xmath39 be any ( non - empty ) set , the free magma @xmath40 generated by @xmath39 can be described to be the set of planar binary trees with leaves decorated by the elements of @xmath39 , together with the `` @xmath31 '' product described above @xcite .",
    "moreover , the linear span @xmath30 , generated by the trees of the magma @xmath40 defined above , equipped with the grafting `` @xmath31 '' is a description of the free magmatic algebra .    for any positive integer @xmath41 ,",
    "a rooted tree of degree @xmath41 , or simply @xmath41-rooted tree , is a finite oriented tree together with @xmath41 vertices .",
    "one of them , called the root , is a distinguished vertex without any outgoing edge .",
    "any vertex can have arbitrarily many incoming edges , and any vertex distinct from the root has exactly one outgoing edge .",
    "vertices with no incoming edges are called leaves .",
    "a rooted tree is said to be planar , if it is endowed with an embedding in the plane .",
    "otherwise , its called a ( non - planar ) rooted tree . here",
    "are the planar rooted trees up to four vertices : @xmath42    denote by @xmath43 ( respectively @xmath44 ) the set of all planar ( respectively non - planar ) rooted trees , and @xmath12 ( respectively @xmath45 ) the linear space spanned by the elements of @xmath43 ( respectively @xmath44 ) .",
