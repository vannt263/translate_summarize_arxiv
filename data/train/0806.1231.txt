    "the authentication of public messages is a fundamental problem nowadays for bipartite and network communications .",
    "the scenario is the following : alice sends a ( classical ) message to bob through a public channel , together with an authentication tag through a private or public channel .",
    "the tag will allow bob to verify if the message he received via the public channel has been tampered with or if it is indeed the authentic message , originally sent by alice .",
    "a third character , eve , wants to sabotage this scheme by intercepting alice s message and sending her own message to bob , together with a false tag which will convince bob he is receiving the authentic message .",
    "for instance , one could imagine that alice is sending to bob her bank account number , to which bob will transfer some money , and eve wants to interfere in the communication in such a way that bob will receive her bank account number believing it is alice s one , thus giving his money to eve .",
    "the use of authentication tags allows to separate the secrecy problem in message transmission from the authentication problem and it is useful even if a secure communication channel is available  @xcite .    in 1983 , g. brassard proposed a computationally secure scheme of classical authentication tags based on the sharing of short secret keys  @xcite .",
    "brassard s scheme is itself an improvement of the wegman - carter protocol  @xcite .",
    "brassard showed that a relatively short seed of a prg can be used as a secret key shared between alice and bob which will allow the exchange of computationally secure authentication tags .",
    "this method yields a much more practical protocol , where the requirements on the seed length grow reasonably with the number of messages we want to authenticate , as opposed to the wegman - carter proposal .",
    "the security of prgs is based on the alleged hardness of some problems of number theory , e.g. , the factorization of a large number with classical computers",
    ". however , several of these problems are provably solvable if quantum computers are available .",
    "consequently , the security of the prgs might be compromised . assuming alice and bob communicate quantically ,",
    "can eve yet menacing the prg security ?",
    "this question is our main motivation to write this article .    in this work ,",
    "we extend brassard s protocol to include quantum - encoded authentication tags , which we prove will offer , under certain conditions , information - theoretical security for the authentication of classical messages .",
    "we observe that our scheme can authenticate the quantum channel itself , which is an important part of the quantum cryptography : in fact , it is the crucial first step of quantum key distribution protocols .",
    "in this section we set up basic notation , briefly review the description of the brassard s protocol and describe our new proposal .",
    "we conclude the section with a negative result on the robustness of an attackable prg when its output is hidden by a specific quantum coding .",
    "we denote @xmath0 the set of messages and @xmath1 the set of tags , where @xmath2 .",
    "as hash functions are an important ingredient for all protocols described here we start by presenting their formal definition  @xcite :    let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be finite sets and call functions from @xmath0 to @xmath1 _ hash functions_. let @xmath3 be a positive real number .",
    "a set @xmath4 of hash functions is @xmath5almost strongly universal-2 if the following two conditions are satisfied    * the number of hash functions in @xmath4 that takes an arbitrary @xmath6 to an arbitrary @xmath7 is exactly @xmath8 * the fraction of those functions that also takes @xmath9 in @xmath0 to an arbitrary @xmath10 ( possibly equal to @xmath11 ) is no more than @xmath12    the number @xmath3 is related to the probability of guessing the correct tag with respect to an arbitrary message @xmath13 .",
    "notice that the smaller @xmath14 is , the larger is @xmath15 .    for additional details on universal-2 functions",
    "we point the reader to  @xcite .",
    "brassard s protocol ( see figure  [ f : qauthbrassard ] ) makes use of two secret keys .",
    "the first one , @xmath16 specifies a fixed universal-2 hash function @xmath17 where @xmath18 the second specifies the seed @xmath19 , for a prg , a sequence of @xmath20 bits .",
    "the main ingredient of our first quantum - enhanced protocol proposed here ( see figure  [ f : qauthproposed ] ) is replacing the classical gate ` xor ` of brassard protocol by a quantum encoder similar to that used in the bb84 protocol  @xcite .",
    "after some developments , we shall verify that the key @xmath21 is no longer necessary .",
    "assume that alice and bob agree on two orthonormal bases @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the 2-dimensional hilbert space , @xmath24 these bases will be used to prepare four quantum states .",
    "we shall refer to this preparation process as _",
    "quantum coding_. for each bit of the @xmath25 bits long tag @xmath26 , alice prepares a quantum state @xmath27 determined by the bit @xmath28 from the prg and the corresponding bit @xmath29 of 2-radix representation of the tag @xmath30 then , if the bit @xmath31 alice prepares @xmath32 using basis @xmath22 , such that @xmath33 similarly , if the bit @xmath34 , alice prepares @xmath32 using basis @xmath23 , such that @xmath35 after the qubits generation , alice sends the separable state @xmath36 to bob through a noiseless quantum channel and the message @xmath13 through an unauthenticated classical channel . at the reception",
    ", bob performs measurements to obtain a sequence of @xmath37 bits from the quantum encoded version of @xmath38 for the @xmath39-th received qubit , bob measures it using the basis @xmath40 or @xmath23 depending on the @xmath41th bit of @xmath42 is 0 or 1 , respectively , recovering a @xmath37-bit long string @xmath43 .",
    "because the quantum channel is assumed to be perfect , bob recognizes that the message is authentic if @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the message received from the classical channel .",
    "otherwise , bob assumes that eve tried to send him an unauthentic message .",
    "this concludes the authentication protocol for one message . throughout this article",
    "it is always assumed that the above coding rule is public .    even though we assume a noise - free quantum channel",
    ", we observe that if the quantum channel is noisy , the only piece of information requiring error - protecting coding is the block of bits @xmath29 of the tag @xmath46 . the sequence of bases to be prepared by alice and bob is known a priori , determined locally by the sequence of bits from the prg .",
    "a future task is evaluating the effects of the utilization of error - correcting codes to the bits of @xmath47 .    in a warning against alleged collective attacks ,",
    "we notice that our analysis allows eve to make general procedures ( suggested in figure  [ f : qauthproposed ] by the block labeled povm ) without being detected .",
    "our results are robust to such powerful and unrealistic assumption for the attacker .",
    "note that our quantum scheme aims at minimizing the key length for one - way transmission .",
    "another example of such an approach is given in  @xcite .",
    "next we focus on crucial aspects of the prgs .",
    "clearly , it is important to understand how secure the authentication code described above is . as we shall see , the security of the authentication code is deeply related with to quality of the pseudo - random generator .",
    "the quality of a pseudo - random generator is evaluated by the hardness to discriminate its pseudo - random sequence output from a truly random sequence or by the hardness to find its seed .",
    "the first quality evaluation relates to the prg s robustness against _ distinguishing attacks _ , the second relates to the so - called _ state recovery attacks_. in  @xcite it is shown that a state recovery attack is a subclass of the distinguishing attacks .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "if the pseudo - random generator can be attacked by a quantum computer so does the authentication code . to set this result we refer to figure  [ f : qauth3 ] , that describes a simple scheme to assist us the proof . in this scheme",
    ", we simply allow eve to compare a sequence @xmath48 of classical bits with the corresponding sequence @xmath49 obtained from the measurement apparatus povm . recall that a pseudo - random generator is a polynomial - time family of functions @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the set @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the pseudo - generator for seeds with size @xmath20 , that is , @xmath54 returns the @xmath39-th bit generated from @xmath20 bits long seed @xmath55 .",
    "pseudo - random generators are expected to fulfill an indistinguishability property that we will not detail here for the sake of simplicity ( more details on  @xcite ) . in the following definition",
    "we write @xmath56 to denote a subsequence of @xmath57 ( not necessarily contiguous ) bits generated by @xmath58    _ we say that a pseudo - random generator @xmath59 is _ attackable in ( quantum / probabilistic ) polynomial time _ if there exists a ( quantum / probabilistic ) polynomial time algorithm @xmath60 and polynomial @xmath61 such that if @xmath60 is fed with a subsequence of @xmath57 ( not necessarily contiguous ) generated bits @xmath62 of @xmath59 we have that : @xmath63 _    for a pseudo - random generator to be attackable , there must exist an algorithm ( quantum or probabilistic ) that receives a subsequence of @xmath57 generated bits ( not necessarily contiguous ) and is able to compute the seed up to a negligible uncertainty .",
    "we observe that the security / randomness of the pseudo - random generator can not be grounded in the fact that the attack can only be performed to a contiguous subsequence of generated bits .",
    "this is due to the fact that the generator could always hide some bits if the attack required this type of sequences .",
    "a simple example of a pseudo - random generator that can be attackable in polynomial time are the pseudo - number generators based on linear congruence  @xcite .",
    "[ thm : negativo]_if a pseudo - random generator @xmath59 is _ attackable in ( quantum / probabilistic ) polynomial time _ then the scheme presented in figure  [ f : qauth3 ] is not secure in polynomial - time for a quantum adversary that has access to @xmath64 . _    since @xmath59 is attackable there exists a quantum polynomial time algorithm @xmath60 and a polynomial @xmath61 such that if @xmath60 is fed with @xmath57 bits of the string @xmath42 generated by @xmath59 then @xmath60 computes ( up to negligible uncertainty ) the seed @xmath55 of @xmath59 .",
    "so it is enough to show that eve , upon capturing the qubits generated by @xmath65 , is able to recover ( with non - negligible probability ) @xmath57 bits of @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , assume that eve has captured @xmath66 qubits @xmath67 and has measured them in a random basis ( that is , either the computational or the diagonal basis ) .",
    "eve can now verify if @xmath68 if this occurs eve does not now if the basis chose to encode the @xmath69 bit was the basis she measured or if she got with @xmath70 probability the correct bit due to encoding in the other basis .",
    "however , if the outcome is different ( that is , @xmath71 ) , then she knows that the basis at the @xmath72 bit is the basis she did not choose the measure , because no mismatch would be possible if the encoding was performed with the same basis . in the latter case",
    ", she knows that @xmath73 is either @xmath74 or @xmath75 depending if she measured in the diagonal or the computational basis , respectively .",
    "moreover , this happens with @xmath76 probability .",
    "so the probability of eve not obtaining @xmath57 elements of @xmath42 by measuring @xmath77 qubits is given by the cumulative function of a binomial distribution with @xmath76 bernoulli trial , @xmath77 trials and success of at most @xmath57 . by hoeffding s inequality",
    "this probability is upper - bounded by @xmath78 which decreases exponentially with @xmath20 , and so in other words , eve has an exponentially increasing probability of obtaining @xmath57 bits of @xmath42 with @xmath77 qubits measurements . since @xmath59 is attackable by knowing @xmath57 bits of @xmath42 , eve is able to perform this attack up to negligible probability .",
    "@xmath79    [ corollary:1 ] _",

    ". therefore she can apply theorem  [ thm : negativo ] by observing a number @xmath82 of tags such that @xmath83 @xmath84    although theorem  [ thm : negativo ] points that the quantum coding of figure  [ f : qauth3 ] is not better asymptotically than the classical coding ( where we simply replace the quantum coder @xmath65 by a @xmath85 gate ) , it seems harder to attack the quantum scheme .",
    "we will now show that this is true for the simple case where the encoder is fed by an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",

    "the following example illustrates that this is true even for a very simple generator .",

    "the greatest common divisor @xmath97 of some @xmath98 gives the value of @xmath86 .",
    "the rest of the seed , that is @xmath99 and @xmath100 , follow then from a system of linear equations . in practice",

    "we notice that the state recovery attack is applicable without change to the ` xor`-based scheme .",
    "it is enough to compute @xmath102 before applying the algorithm .",
    "in contrast , for the quantum scheme , eve is submitted to an irreducible uncertainty on the @xmath42 values due to quantum coding . in particular ,",
    "if she employs the procedure described in the proof of the theorem  [ thm : negativo ] it is expected only one fourth of the @xmath42 s are expected to be correct . the problem from eve s point of view is how to solve the seed from a degraded version of the algorithm input @xmath42 .",
    "in the last section we have considered the problem of the state recovering attack and defined the weakness of a prg . in this section we make a rigorous comparison between the ` xor ` and the quantum coding performances using information - theoretical measures .    to this end",

    "observe that the measurement may depend on the message @xmath13 , which is public .",
    "the goal of eve is to maximize the knowledge of @xmath42 , that is , minimize the entropy @xmath105 .",
    "we consider the classical and quantum scheme presented in figure  [ f : cqbits ] in two ways : firstly , we will assume that @xmath42 is a sequence of fair and independent bernoulli random variables , that is , the prg describing @xmath42 is perfect .",
    "secondly , we consider a biased prg ( unfair ) to describe @xmath42 and introduce blocks of random variables into the analysis .",
    "we start with the simple case of a single - sized block and where @xmath106 . in the classical ` xor ` encoding case we have that @xmath107 and thus @xmath108 , and so eve has no doubt about @xmath42 . in the quantum encoding case , the holevo bound states that @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the density operator describing the encoding by @xmath111 that is @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "consequently , unconditional secrecy relative to @xmath11 , @xmath259 can not be assured .      in this subsection",
    "we introduce a condition to attain unconditional security of the tag in terms of conditioned mutual information between @xmath11 and the @xmath150block of bits of the key .",
    "[ prop : sufficient]_if @xmath260 then the tag is secure in the information theoretical sense , that is , @xmath261 . _    from the standard chain rule of shannon entropy",
    "we have : @xmath262 then , comparing  ( [ e:1 ] ) and  ( [ e:2 ] ) we obtain @xmath263 where @xmath207 is due to a simple manipulation of   and  , @xmath208 is definition of mutual information and @xmath264 follows because the hash function is determined by @xmath158 and so , then @xmath265 is immediately calculated .",
    "that is , @xmath266 the results follows from  .",
    "@xmath84    eq",
    ".   clearly indicates that in order to increase eve s uncertainty about @xmath11 we must maximize the mutual information between the block @xmath158 and the tag @xmath267 this is the _ information - theoretical _ hint that motivates the scheme presented in figure  [ f : qauthitsugestion ] . note that in this case we make the tag @xmath11 depend of @xmath158 , increasing thus their mutual information . in brassard scheme ( see figure  [ f : qauthbrassard ] ) the hash function is fixed in the beginning , and therefore @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the observation that eve can perform in brassard s scheme .",
    "it is remarkable to be possible to attain unconditional security of the tag using non - fair bernoulli for @xmath42 with the proposed of figure  [ f : qauthitsugestion ] .",
    "this fact is in sharp contrast with the classical setup for which only bernoulli sequences can assure that requirement .",
    "thus , a good approximation is to use prg for the sequence of @xmath42 , and the mutual information @xmath270 is as high as the prg is unbiased , since that mutual information is mediated by the random variable @xmath134 .",
    "it is clear that , if we are dealing with real prgs ( that do not generate a sequence of fair bernoullis ) , then the conditions of theorem  [ thm : positivo ] should be considered in order to evaluate the number of messages that can be authenticated before leaking too much information .",
    "another possibility to apply the scheme of figure  [ f : qauthitsugestion ] is to spend just @xmath271 key bits per message to protect the current tag .",
    "this approach is similar to brassard s scheme , but improves it since the tag is protected by the quantum coding .",
    "observe that as @xmath272 , this scheme is less costly in terms of key consumption .      in this case , the bounds derived in section  [ sec : comparing ] remain valid , namely the inequality   that we recall @xmath273 in this case , since the measurement @xmath134 is on the quantum encoding of the tag , and not on the quantum encoding of @xmath13 , the uncertainty is greater than that of the case discussed in section  [ sec : comparing ] .",
    "so , with the scheme of figure  [ f : qauthitsugestion ] , not only we obtain a high equivocation about the tag , but we also increase the uncertainty of the sequence @xmath158 and , therefore , also of the seed @xmath55 of the prg .",
    "observe that theorem  [ thm : positivo ] and inequality  [ e : limitek ] are also valid for this scheme , and can be used to get bounds about the size of @xmath37 for which a threshold of information is leaked to eve .",
    "in this work we have investigated how quantum resources can improve the security of brassard s classical message authentication protocol .",
    "we have started by showing that a quantum coding of secret bits offers more security than the classical ` xor ` function introduced by brassard .",
    "then , we have used this quantum coding to propose a quantum - enhanced protocol to authenticate classical messages , with improved security with respect to the classical scheme introduced by brassard in 1983 .",
    "our protocol is also more practical in the sense that it requires a shorter key than the classical scheme by using the pseudorandom bits to choose the hash function .",
    "we then establish the relationship between the bias of a prg and the amount of information about the key that the attacker can retrieve from a block of authenticated messages .",
    "finally , we prove that quantum resources can improve both the secrecy of the key generated by the prg and the secrecy of the tag obtained with a hidden hash function .",
