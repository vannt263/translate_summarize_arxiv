    "in high energy collisions of leptons , hadrons and nuclei we observe the production of many particles , mainly hadrons .",
    "the ultimate goal in multiparticle production studies is the explanation of the hadronic phenomena within qcd , the basic theory of the strong interactions , along with the other interactions of the standard model and possibly beyond .",
    "a basic problem in the qcd study of multiparticle production is the matching of parton and hadron dynamics relevant in the respective weak and strong coupling regimes of qcd .",
    "a class of inclusive observables in hard collisions can be computed perturbatively in terms of the running coupling constant @xmath0 thanks to the celebrated asymptotic freedom @xcite . in practice , it is often required to include some additional non - perturbative input from other sources ( parton distribution functions ) .",
    "hadronic phenomena can be systematically analysed within lattice gauge theory in sufficiently simple problems .",
    "the description of genuine multi - hadron production requires , in addition to the hard qcd part ( shower calculus ) , some phenomenological approaches : specific hadronization models or such simple ideas as `` parton hadron duality '' . at present , the systematic approach to multi - hadron production based entirely on qcd remains a dream .",
    "is it just a problem of complexity or do we need a fundamentally new insight ?    in this talk we concentrate on the four topics mentioned in the abstract which represent different variants of the interplay of hard and soft interactions and we emphazise shortly other topics .",
    "i am sorry for the incomplete coverage of the many interesting presentations at this conference .",
    "results are reported from tevatron , hera , rhic and lep accelerators .",
    "of central importance is the comparison with fixed order perturbation theory to test the universality of the coupling constant @xmath1 in all processes . here",
    "the goal is to improve the accuracy of the calculation , in particular by the extension beyond next - to - leading - order accuracy , and to compute within the qcd framework observables of higher complexity .",
    "an important goal is also the discovery of new physics either through the deviation of experimental results from the precision calculations or through better understanding of background processes .    _",
    "top quark production ( d. bauer ) _ has been studied at the tevatron @xmath2 collider where in the new run ii the cms energy is increased from 1.8 to 1.96 tev .",
    "top quarks at these energies are produced primarily in pairs and they decay through @xmath3 . the various decay channels for the @xmath4 have been analysed by both experiments and consistent results have been obtained in eight channels , all compatible with the theoretical computations beyond nlo of @xmath5 pb at @xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "a new value for the top quark mass has been presented by d0 @xcite from a reanalysis of their earlier run i data : @xmath7 gev with considerably reduced errors and this result increases the world average by 4 gev to @xmath8 gev .",
    "the best run ii cdf result so far obtained is @xmath9 gev .",
    "no single top production has been observed and @xmath10 pb at 95% cl ( run ii , cdf ) .    _ single top production ( s.d . ellis)_.",
    "the observation of this process would determine the ckm matrix element @xmath11 and be important in other searches ( higgs , new particles , including extra scalar bosons or gauge bosons , new quarks ) .",
    "the expected rates are still below the presently achieved sensitivity .",
    "therefore some strategies to obtain an improved signal / background ratio are proposed , especially by using the `` signed rapidity '' variable which takes into account the fact that processes with @xmath4 s are not separately c or p invariant .",
    "_ jet production at the tevatron ( l. sawyer ) _ is measured now at the higher cms energy by cdf and d0 .",
    "single inclusive jets are studied up to transverse momenta @xmath12 gev , that is 150 gev higher than in run i and di - jet masses up to @xmath13 gev , also the azimuthal decorrelation of the two jet events which is an effect of @xmath14 is measured .",
    "these results are found in an overall consistency with the nlo qcd predictions @xcite in the extended regime of energy and transverse momentum within the systematic errors which are dominated by the energy scale uncertainty . only in extreme kinematic regions of the azimuthal decorrelation deviations",
    "+ _ production of w , z,@xmath15 + jets ( a. cruz ) _ allows further tests of pqcd at large momentum transfers using different techniques .",
    "the inclusive w production cross section rises from @xmath16 nb at 1.8 tev to @xmath17 nb at 1.96 tev and is well described by the nnlo qcd results of 2.5 and 2.73 nb respectively . for the production of w",
    "together with n jets the distribution of the jet transverse energies have been measured .",
    "there is good agreement with a calculation ( alpgen @xcite ) based on leading order qcd matrix element combined with parton shower development ( herwig @xcite ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : jets ] . here",
    "the experimental uncertainties from the jet energy scale are comparable in size to the theoretical scale uncertainties .",
    "_ central di - photon production _ has been measured up to masses of about 30 gev .",
    "the nlo qcd calculations ( diphox @xcite ) involving the @xmath18 annihilation and quark loop diagram for @xmath19 describe the data well in absolute normalization .",
    "the _ associated production of photon with heavy flavours ( c , b ) _ has been obtained as well for photon energies up to 60 gev .",
    "it agrees with a lo calculation ( pythia @xcite ) .    in summary for tevatron , no serious disagreement of the new data with qcd expectations at different levels of accuracy for the observables of different levels of complexity",
    "are met and so , at the same time , we do not obtain any signal of a new physics .",
    "the other problems discussed here concern the role of the `` underlying event '' ( _ r.d .",
    "field _ , see below ) and the influence of the selection of jets by a particular algorithm ( `` cone '' vs.``@xmath20 '' ) ( _ andrieu _ ) .",
    "_ monte carlo generators , ( l. lnnblad ) _ are being developed to generate parton final states beyond lo for present accelerators but also for the lhc . for problems like production of multi - jet or w+jet events a matching of the nlo matrix element and parton shower has been achieved ; also double scattering effects are being considered .",
    "_ fragmentation functions ( s. kretzer ) _ @xmath21 are compared in @xmath22 and @xmath23 collisions as a tests the collinear factorization approach of qcd at nlo together with universality .",
    "new data obtained at rhic on @xmath24 are well predicted using the previous results @xcite from @xmath23 collisions on @xmath25 at the factorization scale and subsequent dglap evolution .    _ jet production at hera ( c. glasman ) _",
    "has now been measured down to @xmath26 for momentum transfers @xmath27 larger than a few gev@xmath28 . the @xmath27 dependence of of two- and three - jet cross sections in nc dis up to @xmath29 gev@xmath28 , obtained by zeus , is found in good agreement with nlo ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) ) predictions .",
    "the ratio of both results provides an accurate test of the theory and in particular a precise determination of the coupling constant @xmath32 ( stat.)@xmath33 ( exp . ) which by itself compares well with the current world average @xmath34 @xcite but there is still a large theoretical error of ( @xmath35 ) .    of special interest , also in view of further applications to small @xmath36 physics ,",

    "if jets are selected by the h1 collaboration with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then the `` direct '' nlo qcd predictions ( disent @xcite ) , without photon structure , are too low by about a factor 3 for very small @xmath41 . considerable improvement ,",
    "although not full agreement , is obtained if a photon structure is included in the dglap calculation . if one of the two scales @xmath42 or @xmath27 is large compared to the other one the dglap factorization approach works best . whereas work continues to develop the approximations beyond dglap , there is no serious conflict with pqcd at the fundamental level .    _",
    "spin physics_. the spin program at rhic ( _ e .",
    "sichtermann ) _ aims at a measurement of of hard and soft processes with polarised protons .",
    "the single transverse spin asymmetry @xmath43 of forward @xmath44 production has been observed at fnal at @xmath45 and the first results from rhic show that it persists at @xmath46 gev .",
    "new results are also presented from the hermes experiment at desy ( _ i . gregor _ ) on the study of the transverse single - spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive pion production in dis .",
    "this allows the determination of the protons `` transversity '' distribution , which represents the degree to which the quarks are polarised along the proton spin transversely polarized to the virtual photon .",
    "the classical applications of pqcd concern observables for hard processes where the hadrons are either summed over or collected into jets so that fixed order perturbation theory can be applied , as in the previous section .",
    "a further development , surprisingly successful , is the application of pqcd to observables calculated from the individual momenta of hadrons in the final state directly and in general involves a resummation of the perturbation theory .",
    "one has to include some assumptions on the transition from partons to hadrons and eventually on some non - perturbative aspects of colour confinement .",
    "there are final state parton observables , like event shapes , which are infrared and collinear safe , i.e. their values do not change if a collinear or soft gluon is added .",
    "they are less sensitive to soft hadronization effects .",
    "more sensitive are multiplicity observables , such as particle flows inside jets or between jets which are not infrared safe .",
    "these observables are a testing ground for `` parton hadron duality '' ideas ( review by _ yu . dokshitzer _ )",
    ".      _ event shapes ( yu . dokshitzer)_. these observables describe global properties of hadronic final states , in @xmath23 annihilation , for example , one defines `` thrust '' , `` jet mass '' , `` broadening '' and others .",
    "the analysis of these observables in perturbation theory ( an asymptotic expansion ) leads to a description which combines perturbative and non - perturbative aspects , the latter ones represented by a power correction @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this term involves an integral over gluon emissions at small transverse momenta @xmath38 where the coupling constant @xmath48 is ill defined .",
    "it is assumed that this integral is finite and - as the coupling itself - universal for the different observables .",
    "one therefore introduces the parameter @xmath49 at the matching scale @xmath50 to describe the influence from the soft region @xcite .",
    "this result , strictly obtained for partons , is then applied to the experimental hadronic observables assuming a duality between both descriptions .",
    "the calculation has been extended to the differential distribution of shape observables where the non - perturbative effects can shift or squeeze the perturbative spectra by an amount given by @xmath51 . by now , the fits to event shapes in @xmath52 with two parameters provide a competitive determination of @xmath0 with an error of @xmath53 and the universality of the non - perturbative parameter @xmath54 at @xmath55 gev is confirmed within @xmath56 .",
    "_ angularities ( g.sterman)_ : a new class of event shapes allows specific tests for the non - perturbative corrections . from the angles @xmath57 of the particles to the thrust axis and energies @xmath58 one constructs the quantity @xcite @xmath59 which interpolates between thrust ( @xmath60 and broadening ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "again , one can separate a contribution from soft gluon emission which is then represented by a non - perturbative `` shape function '' @xmath62 .",
    "it represents corrections of all higher orders in @xmath63 which should be more appropriate near the collinear limit .",
    "this represents a generalization of the correction @xmath64 above , which corresponds to a shift of the distribution .",
    "once determined at a particular energy one obtains predictions for other energies .",
    "_ interjet radiation : non - global logs_. in dis and hadron - hadron collisions one is led to consider gluon radiation in part of the phase space excluding a region around the beam direction , so energy flow or event shapes are non - global .",
    "such observables obtain contributions from multi - soft emissions which lead to `` non - global log s '' , single logarithmically enhanced contributions @xcite .",
    "the difficulty is that the number of jets is not fixed .",
    "this problem can be tamed by construction of a correlation of the energy flow with an event shape which fixes the number of jets @xcite .",
    "_ automated resummation ( g. zanderighi ) _ : in order to facilitate the calculation of new shape observables , in particular for @xmath2 and dis , a program ( caesar @xcite ) has been developed which , for a class of observables , yields resummed results in nll order by combining analytical and numerical methods .",
    "the limitations concern certain properties in the infrared and collinear limit of the emission ( `` recursively irc - safe '' ) and the dependence on transverse momentum ( `` continuously global '' ) .",
    "old results have been reproduced , new observables derived , for example , the distribution of global transverse thrust @xmath65 constructed from the transverse momenta with respect to the beam axis .",
    "such calculations open up the possibility to considerably extend the kinematic range of these qcd studies towards the higher energies of tevatron and lhc .",
    "these observables are not infrared safe : emission of a soft gluon would increase the multiplicity by + 1 .",
    "finite perturbative results for the parton cascade can be obtained by introducing a cut - off @xmath66 . for @xmath67",
    "the partons represent jets and @xmath68 can be viewed as jet resolution in the sense of the `` @xmath38-algoritm '' , one can also take the small @xmath69 and compare the resulting cascade directly with the hadronic final state in the sense of a duality picture ( `` local parton hadron duality '' @xcite ) , then @xmath68 is a non - perturbative parameter .    _ multiplicities in quark and gluon jets at lep ( k. hamacher ) and tevatron ( a. pronko ) _ : at lep the multiplicity of gluon jets is determined from 3 jet events after subtraction of 2 jet events at a reduced scale ( delphi ) or from 3 jet events using a boost algorithm ( opal @xcite ) .",
    "the quark jet multiplicity is found directly from the total @xmath52 multiplicity .",
    "theoretical results are obtained from resummed perturbation theory .",
    "one approach is based on coupled evolution equations of quark and gluon jets in modified leading logarithmic approximation @xcite which includes fully the @xmath70-correction up to nll order .",
    "these calculations reproduce the multiplicity rise with energy .",
    "the ratio @xmath71 obtains large corrections beyond mlla and is reduced from the asymptotic value @xmath72 to @xmath73 in 3nllo @xcite and to @xmath74 , observed at lep , in the numeric solution @xcite where the only parameters @xmath75 are fit by the total @xmath52 multiplicity .",
    "another calculation is based on the colour dipole model which treats the evolution of dipoles in nll approximation and includes recoil effects @xcite .",
    "it describes the data well using an additional non - perturbative parameter .",
    "the cdf collaboration has separated quark and gluon jets by analysing di - jet and @xmath15 + jet events with known jet compositions .",
    "the multiplicity data are found generally well consistent with @xmath52 results .",
    "the multiplicities reach the higher energies @xmath76 gev where they also follow the 3nlla expectations .    _ particles with low momenta in jets ( a. pronko ) _ , measured by cdf , show the so - called hump - backed plateau in the variable @xmath77 @xcite with the suppression of the low energy , large @xmath78 particles because of soft gluon coherence",

    "although larger than for the full jet result ( @xmath82 ) it is still below @xmath83 expected in @xcite for this limit from the dominance of the primary gluon emission .",
    "this discrepency is likely due to the difficulty to obtain `` pure '' gluon jets , rather , soft particles are emitted from all participating jets of the event .",
    "this problem is avoided in    _ soft particle emission in 3-jet events in @xmath52 ( hamacher)_. the particle multiplicity @xmath84 in a cone perpendicular to the production plane is studied as function of the inter - jet angles @xmath85 .",
    "the gluon radiation into this cone coherently emitted from the @xmath86 `` antenna '' , normalized by a corresponding multiplicity @xmath87 in 2-jet events , is given by the simple expression @xcite @xmath88 \\label{r32}\\ ] ] the first two leading terms represent the dipoles along the @xmath89 directions , in close analogy to qed electric dipoles , except for the colour factors .",
    "the formula interpolates for aligned partons between a colour triplet antenna ( @xmath90 against @xmath89 ) and a colour octet antenna ( @xmath18 against @xmath91 ) with the intensity higher by @xmath92 .",
    "delphi has measured the ratio @xmath93 against the variable @xmath94 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : cone ] ) which shows the scaling behaviour in the angles implicit in ( [ r32 ] ) and the linear dependence with slope @xmath95 well consistent with the expected slope @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the data are sensitive to the small term @xmath96 which corresponds to a negative interference not accessible through purely probabilistic jet algorithms .",
    "it is remarkable that the perturbative calculations describe production of particles with such low momenta ( few 100 mev above threshold ) at low multiplicity .",
    "similar transverse effects are expected for @xmath97 collisions ( @xmath18 antenna in direct , @xmath98 in resolved processes ) and @xmath2 collisions ( low transverse radiation in direct @xmath15 or @xmath4 production , high radiation in gluon jet production ) .    _ underlying event in @xmath2 collisions ( r.d .",

    "the same is observed for the transverse momentum sum in back - to - back jet events . if one triggers in addition on a particle in transverse direction one observes the `` birth '' of a third jet in the same and possibly even on a fourth jet in the opposite direction .",
    "this conclusion is derived from the good agreement with the pythia mc which includes multiple parton collisions whereas herwig without this addition is in a less good agreement .",
    "it will be interesting in future studies to clarify the role of multi - parton scattering and also to investigate the possible reduction of the transverse particle production in direct @xmath15 and @xmath4 production processes as expected for the perturbative gluon radiation mechanism emphasized in the previous paragraph for @xmath52 collisions .",
    "there is an old expectation for the parton density at small @xmath36 to `` saturate '' @xcite , i.e. to become so high that a limiting behaviour related to the finite proton ( or nuclear ) size is reached .",

    "this limit defines the characteristic saturation scale @xmath108 from @xmath109 for small @xmath110 this corresponds to a state of high gluon density .",
    "the theoretical analysis starts from the dipole picture @xcite , formulated in space time , from which the @xmath111 total cross section can be computed as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the wave function of the virtual photon splitting into a @xmath18 dipole , @xmath114 the photon longitudinal momentum fraction of the quark and @xmath115 the transverse size of the dipole .",

    "the ratio @xmath166 , a measure of the number of degrees of freedom , shows a characteristic rise with @xmath164 near @xmath167 mev , @xmath168 gev/@xmath169 , depending also on the number of flavours , over a range of about @xmath170 mev and then , above @xmath171 gev/@xmath169 , becomes nearly @xmath164 independent ; in this region there is still a large ( @xmath172% ) deviation from the asymptotic stefan - boltzmann limit for the ideal quark - gluon gas @xcite .",
    "another prediction concerns the dependence of the critical temperature @xmath173 on the baryochemical potential @xmath174 which can be tested through the hadron composition of the final state .",
    "previous research at the sps has identified various signatures expected for the transition to a qgp , such as strangeness excess , @xmath175-suppression , universal chemical freeze out ; the energy density is found at @xmath176 gev/@xmath169 , just above the critical value . now with rhic a new regime with the much higher initial density of @xmath177 gev/@xmath169 is reached much above the critical density .",
    "this leads to new signatures : a strong asymmetric flow of particles reflecting the initial spacial anisotropy and the strong absorption of high @xmath99 jets in the nucleus ( `` jet quenching '' ) .",
    "it appears particularly impressive with the new rhic data , that more specific qcd tests are now becoming feasible .",
    "a general outline of the rhic results and their interpretation is given by _",
    "r. seto_.      results on @xmath178 collisions from an energy scan over the lower sps energies 20 - 80 agev have been presented by _",
    "p. seyboth_. after the observation of signatures for qgp formation at the top sps energy the aim was to search for an energy threshold of such signatures .",
    "a remarkable effect is seen in the energy dependence of the freeze out temperature , as determined from the slope of the transverse mass of kaons : at low energies there is a strong rise of temperature followed by saturation over the sps energy range and continued rise at rhic energies .",
    "this is the typical behaviour expected for a mixed phase of qgp and hadron gas at constant temperature .",
    "such a behaviour at the energy density @xmath179 gev/@xmath169 in the sps range matches the values expected from lattice calculations .",
    "a threshold effect is also seen for strangeness production , especially the @xmath180 ratio which is a well established signature for qgp formation .",
    "another test of lattice qcd calculations concerns the phase diagram in the variables @xmath164 vs. baryochemical potential @xmath181 .",
    "the analysis of the particle species abundances in statistical models yields values for @xmath164 and @xmath181 at freeze out which converge for low @xmath181 ( high energies ) towards the qcd expectation @xcite .",
    "_ initial stage ( e.g. ferreiro , k. tuchin)_. the initial conditions can be introduced by the gluon density in the nucleus at the saturation scale ( see eq .",
    "( [ qsat ] ) ) as @xmath182 ( `` colour glass condensate '' ) where the @xmath183 dependence is inferred from @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 . assuming proportionality of particle multiplicity and initial gluon rapidity density @xmath187 one finds for an @xmath178 collision with @xmath188 participating nucleons a very slow increase of central hadron multiplicity @xmath189 with energy and centrality @xcite , a very successful prediction ; other predictions from parton saturation follow for the transverse momentum distributions ( review @xcite ) .    _",
    "early interactions : jet production and jet quenching ( miller , vitev)_. these new phenomenona are related to the hard parton - parton scattering in nuclear collisions and subsequent absorption of one parton in the dense medium . the absorption is mainly due to induced gluon radiative energy loss in multiple scattering inside the nucleus and is proportional to the plasma density @xcite .",
    "the most striking evidence for jet quenching comes from the study of azimuthal angle correlations of particles associated with a high @xmath99 trigger particle @xcite : whereas in both @xmath22 and @xmath190 scattering one observes a jet in direction opposite to the trigger jet this away side jet is fully suppressed in central @xmath191 collisions .",
    "this is naturally explained by the hard collision taking place near the edge of the nucleus where one scattered parton leaves the nucleus undisturbed whereas the second parton has to move through the big nucleus .",
    "this measurement demonstrates the big difference between cold nuclear matter traversed in @xmath192 collisions and the matter created in the central @xmath191 collision .",
    "theoretical calculations lead to an estimate of energy density of @xmath193 gev/@xmath169 corresponding to about 100 times nuclear density .",
    "additional studies confirm the absorption strength as function of the nuclear thickness in non - central collisions as well as the reappearence of the lost energy of the primary parton in the soft particles in jet direction .",
    "while these observations provide already a strong argument in favour of the presence of a qgp there are further crucial tests .",
    "qcd predicts the absorpion of a gluon to be stronger than that of the quark by the factor @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , heavy quarks are less absorbed as the small angle radiation is cut off below @xmath194 ( `` dead cone effect '' ) @xcite .",
    "this effect is being searched for in nuclear d meson production ( _ z .",
    "xu _ ) .    _ hydrodynamic evolution , flow phenomena ( y. hama , t. hirano , h. long , j. velkowska and s. voloshin)_. the hydrodynamics description of the particle production process includes the initial condition ( energy density , initial flow ) , the eos for the qgp with a phase transition built in ( parameter : latent heat ) and the freeze out mechanism for hadron production .",
    "the observations related to hydrodynamics are : + 1",
    ". violation of @xmath195-scaling in @xmath178 collisions , which denotes a universal slope @xmath149 in @xmath196 for particles of different mass and works well in @xmath22 scattering . in hydrodynamic",
    "flow the particles acquire similar velocities and therefore protons obtain higher momenta than pions .",
    "an important consequence of hydrodynamics is the appearence of an asymmetric , especially elliptic flow : in the non - central collision of two nuclei there is an almond shape overlap region which generates an asymmetric pressure gradient with maximum in impact direction ; this results in a corresponding asymmetry in energy and particle flow @xmath197 the elliptic flow @xmath198 increases for particles of higher @xmath99 with a delay for heavier particles .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) can be investigated , especially the properties of the phase transition ( latent heat @xmath199 mev/@xmath169 ) which provides another qcd test .",
    "an apparent problem for the hydrodynamic description is met with the bose - einstein correlations between identical particles which depend on the evolution of the space time volume containing the matter .",
    "whereas _ t. hirano _ notes a failure of this description it has been pointed out by _",
    "t. csorg _ in the discussion that the disagreement can be avoided by a proper choice of the initial transverse flow to explain the final `` hubble flow '' ( buda - lund model @xcite ) .",
    "_ coalescence , quark recombination ( r. hwa , j. velkovska , s. voloshin)_. another striking new phenomenon observed at rhic is the grouping of spectra according to the number of constituent quarks .",
    "this is observed in the @xmath99 dependence of the elliptic flow parameter @xmath198 ( @xmath200 gev ) where @xmath201 and @xmath202 fall into separate bands but show a uniform dependence if rescaled according to the number @xmath203 of valence quarks @xcite @xmath204 as an example the @xmath205 spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : val ] .",
    "another observation concerns the ratios @xmath206 of particle spectra for central and peripheral collisions where mesons ( @xmath207 ) and baryons ( @xmath208 antiparticles ) fall into separate bands in the region @xmath209 gev .",
    "this confirms the idea of parton coalescence @xcite .",
    "there are several other `` anomalies '' in nuclear production , for example , the large ratio @xmath210 for large @xmath211 gev which can be explained within a recombination mechanism for thermal and shower partons ( _ r .",
    "hwa _ ) .",
    "the behaviour ( [ valence ] ) suggests that before hadron formation there is a flow of constituent quarks which then recombine into the observed hadrons .",
    "this implies a strong dependence of the @xmath212 composition of the plasma during the evolution as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ evol ] : initially the primary collision produces mainly gluons at high temperature ; during the expansion @xmath18 pairs are produced , but in approaching the critical temperature the gluons are absorbed by the quarks ( `` constituent quarks '' ) which then by coalescence form the final state hadrons .",
    "the strong ordering according to valence content is against expectations from a hadronic resonance gas which would group particles according to mass .",
    "these observations are therefore another strong argument for the presence of a qgp ( although at the end without gluons )",
    ". looked at in reverse order the evolution depicted in fig .",
    "[ evol ] is quite natural : the hadrons under increased pressure dissolve at first into constituent quarks ( as in the additive quark model ) but under increased pressure gluons are easily freed from the constituent quarks and yield a genuine qgp .",
    ", finally the transition from constituent quarks to hadrons .",
    ", width=377 ]    _ strongly interacting qgp_. there is another interesting message in the @xmath99-dependence of the elliptic flow parameter @xmath198 .",
    "using a calculation for a qgp within transport theory @xcite it is found that the gluon - gluon cross sections of few mb expected in pqcd would give negligeable flow effects , only cross sections of @xmath213 mb would yield the observed asymmetric flow .",
    "therefore , the data suggest a strongly interacting qgp and this can be related to the large deviation from the stefan - boltzmann limit of the ideal gas found in the lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "finally , we list a few other topics which have been discussed .",
    "hadronic phenomena_. particle correlations are often not accessible to a qcd description , especially the bose - einstein correlations which turn out to be particularly important in the discussion of heavy ion collisions .",
    "also there are discussions of critical phenomena such as percolation and clustering in a string or hadron model framework .",
    "hadron spectroscopy_. this is another active field with surprising results on unexpected hadronic particles , including the still controversial `` pentaquarks '' , especially @xmath214 , not observed at tevatron , and the new charmonium state with decay @xmath215 reported here by cdf , which stimulates discussions of nonperturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "astroparticle physics_. in this field we witness a flourishing activity where multiparticle production plays an important role , although not as the basic goal of the activity but rather as a tool .",
    "primary cosmic particles of superhigh energies ( @xmath216 tev ) are studied .",
    "the interpretation of the particle yields , in particular the determination of the primary particle energies requires a detailed understanding of the propagation and showering of the cosmic rays ( elementary particles or nuclei ) in various media ( air , earth , ice ) , including the saturation phenomena and production and decay of heavy quarks ( @xmath217 quarks ) .",
    "questions of the role of particles in theories beyond the standard model are being discussed , as well as the origin of such high energy cosmic rays .",
    "the number of multiparticle production phenomena which can be explained within qcd is steadily increasing .",
    "+ _ 1 . hard processes : _ calculations for larger kinematical ranges , for observables of higher complexity and with increasing accuracy agree with the data ,",
    "no definitive failures have been reported this time .",
    "soft particle production : _ it follows perturbative qcd expectations surprisingly well which is in support of a parton hadron duality picture of hadronization with soft colour confinement .",
    "small @xmath36 and diffraction : _ for a high density regime at small @xmath27 there is indirect evidence for saturation ( `` color glass condensate '' ) inferred from the success of saturation models .",
    "intrinsic pomeron structure is a useful concept in diffractive scattering , the systematics of factorization and its breaking are becoming better understood .",
    "+ _ 4 . heavy ions and qgp : _ there is an indication of a phase transition with a mixed phase over the sps energy range .",
    "the higher initial pressure and longer evolution time available at rhic have provided clear evidence for jet quenching and strong elliptic flow with an initial energy density about 100 times higher than in nuclear matter and an order of magnitude above critical density .",
    "these phenomena are adequately described in terms of a strongly interacting qgp ; these observables can be used as new diagnostic tools which allow detailed tests of ( perturbative and non - perturbative ) qcd predictions : parton type dependence of absorpion , equation of state with latent heat and strong deviation from ideal gas limit , phase diagram @xmath173 vs. @xmath181 , the initial cgc state .",
    "hadrons are formed by coalescence of constituent quarks which dominate the qgp in its final stage .",
    "i would like to thank bill gary and his crew for their engagement in organizing this lively meeting which managed to bring together and to mix up the different multiparticle communities to the benefit of all of us .",
