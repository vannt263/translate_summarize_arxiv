    "observations of distant type - ia supernovae are often taken to imply that the universe has entered a phase of accelerating expansion , and may therefore contain ` dark energy ' @xcite .",
    "such a conclusion , however , can not be inferred from the supernova data alone  a model of the universe is also required . at present , the simplest and most widely applied cosmological models",
    "are based on the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) solutions of general relativity .",
    "these solutions are highly symmetric , and determining their validity as models of the real universe is of critical importance for determining the veracity of the claims involving dark energy .",
    "it is toward these ends that this study is aimed : are spatially homogeneous and isotropic models with dark energy the only ones capable of accounting for the recent cosmological observations that appear to imply acceleration ?",
    "the inference of acceleration is of profound consequence , not just for cosmology and gravitational physics , but also for particle and high energy physics .",
    "an accelerating universe has an entirely different causal structure from one that is decelerating , with the vacuum itself taking on a non - zero energy density and becoming thermal . beyond this",
    "there is the ` cosmological constant problem ' , that contributions from the zero - point energy of quantum fields , and any bare cosmological term in einstein s equations , must cancel up to @xmath0 part in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "such incredible fine - tuning is widely believed to signify nothing less than a crisis in modern physics , and so the task of verifying the assumptions that go into our cosmological models becomes one of the utmost importance .",
    "here we focus on the problem of radial inhomogeneity , as modeled by the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solutions of general relativity @xcite .",
    "these are the general spherically - symmetric solutions of einstein s equations with dust .",
    "they are widely known to have more than enough freedom to account for the supernova observations without recourse to dark energy @xcite , and are often referred to as ` void models ' in the literature ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "the relevant question is then whether or not these models are compatible with other observational probes of cosmology .",
    "this question has been addressed by various authors in a number of different contexts @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have , however , limited themselves to the special case of space - times that have a spatially homogeneous energy density at early times .",
    "this is achieved by considering only those models that have a constant ` bang time ' . in this case",
    "it is known that while the small angle cmb generated by a power - law spectrum of initial fluctuations can be easily reproduced within void models , an unacceptably low value of @xmath2 is required to do so @xcite .",
    "however , it is also known that this problem can be alleviated by allowing for _ general _ radial inhomogeneity , with non - constant bang time @xcite . here",
    "we address the problem of whether or not other cosmological observables are also consistent with models that allow for this additional freedom , as well as further investigating the parameter space of solutions that fit the small - angle cmb .    we will be interested in particular in the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect @xcite .",
    "this effect is due to the inverse compton scattering of photons from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) off of electrons in distant clusters of galaxies .",
    "the rescattered light can be collected by observers who are looking at the cluster . if in the rest frame of the electrons the cmb has a non - zero dipole moment ( in the direction of the observer )",
    "then the reflected light that the observer sees has its spectrum shifted .",
    "such shifts are expected to be observable by upcoming experiments , and although they have yet to be directly detected , constraints have already been placed on the allowed magnitude of this effect @xcite .    the ksz effect is a particularly powerful probe of inhomogeneity as it allows us to make observations not only along the null cone that is the boundary of our causal past , but also along null curves that go inside this cone .",
    "the distant galaxy clusters essentially act as mirrors , reflecting light from the last scattering surface that would otherwise be unobservable to us .",
    "this extra information is above and beyond that which is available from the usual observations of distance measures , expansion rates and number counts , and so it is of great potential significance as a cosmological probe .",
    "the power of the ksz effect in this context appears to have first been pointed out by goodman in @xcite , although the first application of it to models that attempt to account for dark energy was performed by garca - bellido and haugblle @xcite .",
    "these authors considered models with constant bang time only .",
    "we build on their work by allowing for a radially dependent bang time .    to make progress it will be necessary to make a number of assumptions , which to avoid confusion we will state here .",
    "we assume the following :    * that there is perfect spherical symmetry , with ourselves at the center of symmetry .",
    "* that the formation of the last scattering surface proceeds as in flrw cosmology .",
    "* that there is a constant ratio of photons to baryons in the early universe .",
    "* that the spectrum of initial fluctuations is a power law in wave number , @xmath3 .",
    "* that the energy density and all functions in the metric have smooth profiles .",
    "[ caveats ]    the first of these is inherent in the problem we have chosen to address .",
    "general perturbations to this exact set of symmetries have been considered in @xcite and @xcite , and the effects of being off - center have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the second of these points is made for convenience . to date , we are unaware of any rigorous calculation involving the formation of the last scattering surface in inhomogeneous space - times . the effect of allowing for an inhomogeneous photon - to - baryon ratio has been considered in @xcite , and the related question of changing the position of the last scattering surface , while keeping the bang time constant , has been addressed in @xcite . the effect of allowing a kink in the spectrum of initial fluctuations has been considered in @xcite .",
    "we will not consider these freedoms further here , but note that a constant bang time is an assumption that would be added to similar lists in most other papers .",
    "for details of the effects of relaxing these assumptions , we refer the reader to the papers cited above .",
    "in section [ model ] we present the ltb solutions , and discuss how distance measures and redshifts are calculated within them .",
    "we then discuss the effects of the two radial degrees of freedom in these solutions , one of which is the bang time . in section [ constraints ]",
    "we discuss some of the cosmological probes that can be applied to these models , with particular reference to the ksz effect .",
    "we also discuss why these observations are problematic for ltb models with constant bang time .",
    "in section [ results ] we present our results , which include a detailed investigation of the effect of a radially varying bang time on cmb and @xmath2 observations , as well as the ksz effect .",
    "we show that , despite the additional freedom in the bang time , there is a combination of key observables that can not be fitted simultaneously .",
    "we conclude in section [ discussion ] that this effectively rules out void models as an explanation of dark energy , unless one is prepared to discard one or more of the assumptions that we have listed above .",
    "in order to model general radial inhomogeneity we will use the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solutions of general relativity .",
    "these are given by the line - element @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 , and where @xmath6 must satisfy @xmath7 the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , and primes and over - dots denote partial derivatives with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "these solutions are exact , and are the general spherically symmetric dust - only solutions to einstein s equations .",
    "they admit a three dimensional group of killing vectors that act transitively on the surfaces of constant @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and are spatially isotropic about the origin only .",
    "solutions to eq .",
    "( [ ltbfriedmann ] ) are of the form @xmath12 , which introduces a third arbitrary function of @xmath10 .",
    "this gives a total of three free functions : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath13 .",
    "we refer to these quantities as the spatial curvature , gravitational mass density ( distinct from the local energy density ) and bang time , respectively . in the limit of homogeneity",
    "they are all constant .",
    "it can also be seen that one can perform a coordinate transformation @xmath14 that preserves the form of the metric in eq .",
    "( [ ltble ] ) . this freedom can be used to set @xmath15constant , without loss of generality ( assuming @xmath16 is always positive ) .",
    "this leaves us with the general solution in terms of the spatial curvature , @xmath8 , and bang time function , @xmath13 , only .",
    "analytic parametric solutions to eq .",
    "( [ ltbfriedmann ] ) are known , and can be found in @xcite .",
    "we can now use these solutions as cosmological models that exhibit an arbitrary amount of radial inhomogeneity by supposing ourselves to be observers at the center of symmetry .",
    "such models are known to be able to produce excellent fits to the supernova data without requiring any dark energy , and often result in the observer being at the center of gigaparsec - scale underdensity , or ` void ' .",
    "this is possible due to both temporal _ and _ spatial variations in the geometry of the space - time that are experienced by photons as they travel through the void .",
    "such calculations require knowledge of redshifts and distance measures in this space - time , which we will now consider .",
    "let us first define two different hubble rates : a transverse one , @xmath17 , and a radial one , @xmath18 . in the limit of homogeneity",
    "these two quantities are identical , but differ , in general , in inhomogeneous space - times .",
    "the redshift of photons traveling along radial geodesics can then be calculated by integrating the radial hubble rate as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a solution of the radial geodesic equation , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the time at which the photon was emitted and observed , respectively .",
    "note that the relation @xmath23 no longer holds , in general .",
    "we can also calculate the angular diameter distance to objects at redshift @xmath24 using @xmath25 where @xmath26 is calculated by inverting @xmath27 from eq .",
    "( [ eqn - redshift - central ] ) , and @xmath28 is found using the radial null geodesic equation .",
    "luminosity distances are then given by etherington s reciprocity theorem @xcite @xmath29 which is true in any space - time .",
    "the local energy density is given by @xmath30 .",
    "in this paper we will often choose to parametrize the two functions @xmath8 and @xmath13 as gaussian curves , with @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constants , and the factor @xmath37 is included to attenuate the bang time profile at large @xmath10 .",
    "this is done so that wide profiles can be used , while limiting the effect of early inhomogeneity on the central observer s last scattering surface , and is discussed further in section [ tb ] .",
    "the profiles above are defined by their amplitudes , @xmath38 , and widths , @xmath39 .",
    "a further parameter @xmath36 defines the asymptotic spatial curvature , outside the void .",
    "the timescale of the model is set by choosing a local hubble parameter @xmath40 at time @xmath22 , where @xmath41 is the age of the universe along the worldline of an observer at @xmath42 .",
    "a rescaling can be used to set @xmath43 .",
    "the amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ eqn - k - profile ] ) and ( [ eqn - tb - profile ] ) can be expressed in a more familiar form as fractions of the total density at the origin today .",
    "for this purpose let us define @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , restricting ourselves to @xmath46 means that we consider only @xmath47 .",
    "let us now briefly consider the consequences of fluctuations in @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "the former of these is the analog of the spatial curvature in flrw solutions , which dominates the dynamical evolution of the universe at late times .",
    "the latter changes the location of the initial singularity , and so can be thought of modifying the early stages of the universe s history .",
    "this interpretation is supported by treating the ltb geometry as a fluctuation about an flrw solution . in this case the fluctuations in @xmath8 can be mapped into growing modes , while fluctuations in @xmath13 are mapped onto decaying modes @xcite .",
    "let us first consider @xmath8 .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ ltbfriedmann ] ) that @xmath48 gives a positive contribution to the expansion of @xmath6 , while @xmath49 gives a negative contribution .",
    "this is the behavior we are familiar with from the friedmann equation of flrw cosmology .",
    "unlike the homogeneous flrw solutions , however , the expansion of @xmath50 does not always get a positive contribution from @xmath48 . on the contrary , in regions of @xmath48 the expansion of @xmath50 can slow , and",
    "recollapse can occur .",
    "this behavior is well known , and can lead to the formation of a ` shell crossing singularity ' when the collapsing region reaches @xmath51 .",
    "one can avoid shell crossing singularities in a region by satisfying the hellaby - lake conditions @xcite .",
    "these depend on the sign of @xmath8 , and for @xmath52 may be written using our notation as @xcite @xmath53 while for @xmath54 the last of these should be replaced by @xmath55^\\prime + { 3 t_b^\\prime |k| \\over 8 \\pi g m } \\ge 0 .",
    "% , ~ { \\rm and } ~ t_b^\\prime \\le 0.\\ ] ] these conditions guarantee that @xmath56 , so that shell crossing singularities can not occur .",
    "when @xmath54 . for details of this",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "they are , however , very restrictive , and most applications of the ltb solutions to cosmology simply avoid the issue by making sure that shell crossings only happen in the distant future .",
    "they can then be considered as a breakdown of the model at some future time , after which a more sophisticated solution including pressure would be required to avoid the formation of singularities .",
    "the existence of pressure is expected to prevent the complete collapse of matter , and a large overdensity of collapsed structures is thus expected to form instead .",
    "let us now consider the consequences of fluctuations in @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath13 is not constant , then the ` age of the universe ' differs from place to place .",
    "this is a significant departure from the standard picture of the big bang , and may initially seem odd .",
    "certainly , there have been a number of objections to allowing inhomogeneous bang times in the literature , with the result that to date most studies of void models have expressly set @xmath57constant _ a fortiori_. in this section we will discuss the physical significance of an inhomogeneous big bang , and argue that it is reasonable to consider models with such a feature .    as mentioned above",
    ", fluctuations in @xmath13 correspond to decaying modes when the space - time is approximated as a perturbed flrw solution .",
    "a non - constant bang time therefore corresponds to an inhomogeneous early universe , and as one goes further back in time the size of the consequent inhomogeneity generally increases . as with the case of fluctuations in @xmath8 , there exist points beyond which the scale factor @xmath50 is contracting rather than expanding , and in cases where the hellaby - lake conditions are violated , shell crossing singularities can occur . in the case of fluctuations in @xmath13",
    ", however , this behavior occurs at very early times rather than at very late times .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - tb - early - behaviour ] we illustrate the existence of surfaces of @xmath51 in cases with @xmath58 , and regions with @xmath59 in cases with @xmath60 .",
    "the former of these are the early universe analogue of the shell crossing singularities we described in the previous section , and in this case we consider the singular surface with @xmath51 to be our initial hypersurface .",
    "the latter case corresponds to regions that have started to collapse , but reach the singular surface @xmath61 before shell crossings occur .",
    "contraction of this type should be expected to cause blueshifts when looking along exactly radial geodesics @xcite , and again this behavior has an analog in the inhomogeneities that form at late times @xcite .",
    "such blueshifts would have profound effects if they were allowed to occur between the last scattering surface and an observer ( for example , a distance - redshift relation @xmath62 that is not monotonic could occur ) .",
    "then a surface exists with @xmath51 , corresponding to the occurrence of a shell crossing singularity ( dotted line ) . beyond this , the formal solution for the energy density gives negative values ( hatched area ) .",
    "lower panel : if @xmath60 , regions with @xmath59 form ( hatched area ) .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the surfaces @xmath61 . ]",
    "clrier _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found that small variations in the bang time , of order hundreds of years , lead to temperature anisotropies in the cmb of @xmath63 , which are currently only marginally too small to be observed .",
    "larger bang time variations would have a stronger observational signal , but this need not be an issue if the region of varying bang time occurs far inside the void , away from the surface of last scattering that we see directly .",
    "nevertheless , observers elsewhere in the space - time would see considerable anisotropies in their cmb sky , and this could be observable in the ksz effect we see from cmb photons that rescatter off their cluster .",
    "the ksz effect therefore has the potential to provide powerful constraints on the inhomogeneities caused by bang time fluctuations .    of course , ltb models are dust - only solutions of einstein s equations , and lose their validity when radiation becomes important at early times @xcite .",
    "the introduction of a radiation fluid into inhomogeneous solutions complicates matters considerably , and we do not attempt to include the gravitational effects of radiation in our models here . however , in the same way that one would expect pressure to prevent the formation of shell crossing singularities at late times , one could reasonably speculate on a similar mechanism occurring at early times . in the present study we concentrate on the matter dominated phase of the universe s history , which should be sufficient to model the universe from last scattering to the present time .",
    "this is well modeled by the ltb solutions .",
    "we leave the consideration of the gravitational effects of inhomogeneous radiation fields to other studies . for further details of this the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .",
    "an obvious concern with models of this type is that they are difficult to reconcile with early universe inflation .",
    "this is true with models that have @xmath64constant , as well as models with an inhomogeneous big bang .",
    "one must then either discard inflation for the time being , or attempt to construct inflationary scenarios that result in occasional large inhomogeneities ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . here",
    "we address the problem of what can be said about the geometry of the universe directly from observations , rather than imposing requirements from theories of the very early universe .",
    "void models that reproduce the observed supernova distance modulus curve have proved relatively easy to construct , and little more than a moderately deep underdensity with a comoving width of order a gigaparsec is required to obtain a satisfactory fit .",
    "indeed , the ease with which the supernova observations can be reproduced has been one of the principle factors motivating interest in these models .",
    "the introduction of such a large inhomogeneity , however , can hardly be expected to leave predictions for other cosmological observables unchanged , and so there have been a number of attempts to make detailed tests of voids using multiple data sets @xcite . while thorough , these previous studies have limited themselves to the case of voids with constant bang times . in this section",
    "we summarize the constraints that can be imposed on such void models from observations of supernovae , the cmb , the local hubble parameter , and the ksz effect .",
    "in particular , we draw attention to the difficulty that voids with constant bang time have in fitting the cmb and @xmath2 simultaneously , and discuss the power of the ksz effect as a test of large - scale inhomogeneity in these models @xcite",
    ".    in section [ results ] we will proceed to consider more general voids with varying bang times .",
    "this additional freedom allows some of the constraints on the specific observables discussed in this section to be weakened significantly ( although a combined fit to all data sets remains elusive ) .      as noted above ,",
    "fitting the supernova data is a relatively simple matter , and void models can be constructed that fit any given @xmath65 curve _ exactly _ @xcite .",
    "one should be aware , however , that reproducing the precise effects of @xmath66 at low @xmath24 requires an energy density profile that is ` cusped ' at the center @xcite .",
    "generic smooth profiles produce qualitatively different behavior , due to the milne - like geometry near the origin , but can still be shown to be consistent with current data sets @xcite .      if the last scattering surface we observe is located in a region of the universe that is homogeneous and isotropic enough to be modeled as being approximately flrw then we can use standard techniques to calculate the power spectrum of fluctuations on that surface .",
    "the cmb that we measure on our sky then depends on the initial spectrum , which can be calculated using an effective flrw model , and the projection of fluctuations from the last scattering surface onto our sky .",
    "this projection depends on the space - time geometry between us and the last scattering surface , and can be calculated from the angular diameter distance in eq .",
    "( [ eqn - da ] ) .",
    "it is in this way that the cmb provides constraints on the geometry of the late universe .",
    "in general , voids and flrw models with the same local geometry have different angular diameter distances to the last scattering surface , resulting in a relative shift in their observed cmb power spectra .",
    "now , the distance to last scattering can be adjusted by changing the width and depth of the void , but this typically produces relatively small shifts that are not enough to bring the peak positions of the cmb power spectrum in line with current observational constraints @xcite . changing the curvature of the flrw region near the last scattering surface , however , produces much larger effects @xcite , and good fits to the small - scale cmb power spectrum can be found for void models that have positive asymptotic curvature .",
    "such models , however , require an anomalously low local hubble rate ( @xmath67 km s@xmath68 mpc@xmath68 ) in order to keep the expansion rate at last scattering low enough to be consistent with the data @xcite .",
    "this is strongly inconsistent with the observed value of @xmath69 km s@xmath68 mpc@xmath68 recently found in @xcite .",
    "the cmb@xmath70 by themselves are therefore sufficient to effectively rule out simple void models with constant bang time",
    ".    one can attempt to avoid this conclusion by violating the assumptions that we set out in section [ intro ] .",
    "in particular , models with inhomogeneous last scattering surfaces have been considered in @xcite and @xcite , and a non - power law spectrum of initial fluctuations has been considered in @xcite . if one is prepared to consider such additional freedoms then the cmb@xmath70 constraints can be considerably weakened .    in section [ results",
    "] we will consider the consequences of cmb observations in general void models , where the bang time is allowed to vary .",
    "it has already been shown in @xcite that the available constraints from the cmb@xmath70 can be considerably weakened in this case , without any need to violate the assumptions introduced in section [ intro ] . in section [ results ] we will quantify this result , finding best fit models and confidence regions in parameter space .",
    "we will show that the best fit models have bang time fluctuations of order a billion years .",
    "a promising observable for testing large - scale homogeneity is the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect .",
    "this effect occurs because galaxy clusters contain hot gas that can compton scatter cmb photons , leading to a frequency - dependent temperature increment / decrement of the cmb along the line of sight to the cluster .",
    "such scattering events cause two separate effects that can be distinguished in the reflected light .",
    "the first is due to transfer of thermal energy from the cluster gas to the photons , and is known as the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "the second is due to the dipole , @xmath71 , of the cmb radiation on the sky of an observer comoving with the reflecting cluster , and is known as the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite .",
    "it produces a temperature change of @xmath72 in the reflected light , and is similar to the relativistic doppler shift that one would experience by reflecting a beam of light off of a moving mirror .    as noted by goodman",
    "@xcite , and explicitly calculated by garca - bellido and haugblle @xcite , observers who are off - center in a radially - inhomogeneous universe should expect to see a large @xmath71 in their cmb if they are comoving with the dust .",
    "this is because the distance - redshift relation becomes a function of direction in an inhomogeneous space - time , so that the surface of last scattering will appear to be at different distances / redshifts in different directions on the sky of an off - center observer .",
    "the result of a large ksz effect then follows because most observers in the space - time see a highly anisotropic cmb .",
    "of course , this is not the case in an flrw universe , where one should anticipate a low ksz signal due only to the peculiar motion of clusters .",
    "it is for this reason that the ksz effect is expected to be a powerful probe of large - scale inhomogeneity .    in a void model",
    "the dipole in the cmb is aligned in the radial direction due to spherical symmetry , and can be calculated from the relative velocity to an observer at the same point who would see an isotropic cmb .",
    "it is this dipole that can then , in principle , be measured using the ksz effect .",
    "now , the magnitude of dipole , @xmath71 , can be calculated for a given void model by finding the redshifts to last scattering when looking radially into and out of the void .",
    "the observer then sees an average temperature of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the temperatures of cmb photons seen when looking into and out of the center of symmetry , respectively , and the relative velocity with respect to the cmb rest frame that causes this dipole is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the redshifts to last scattering in the directions toward and away from the center of the void , respectively .",
    "they can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eqn - redshift - central ] ) , which is valid for off - center observers @xcite .",
    "the ksz effect can also be measured as a power spectrum using @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the cmb anisotropy seen by an off - center observer in a direction @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the optical depth along the line of sight , @xmath83 is the density contrast of electrons , and @xmath84 is the redshift to the last scattering surface .    one should note that the calculation described above over - estimates @xmath71 in the reflected light because the anisotropy seen by off - center observers will not be purely dipolar , especially far from the center of the void @xcite .",
    "the dipole contribution , however , is the dominant one at low @xmath24 , and so we expect the prescription outlined above to be accurate enough for our current purposes .",
    "observations of individual clusters have yielded upper limits of @xmath85 kms@xmath68 @xcite , and more recent observations from act and spt have produced upper limits on the ksz power spectrum at @xmath86 of 8 @xmath87k@xmath88 and 13 @xmath87k@xmath88 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the typical peculiar velocities expected in @xmath66cdm of @xmath89400 kms@xmath68 , but is strongly inconsistent with any large void with constant bang time that obeys the assumptions made in section [ intro ] @xcite .",
    "an example @xmath90 profile that an observer at the center of a large void with constant bang time could infer from observations of the ksz effect is shown in figure [ fig - vp - basic ] .",
    "although this is only one example , the enormous magnitude of the effect is a generic result for observers located at the center of such voids .",
    "this directly demonstrates the utility of the ksz effect as a probe of inhomogeneity on large scales , and explains why current observational constraints on the ksz effect by themselves are enough to rule out simple voids with constant bang time . in section [ results ]",
    "we consider the consequences of a varying bang time on observations of the ksz effect , and show that there exist general giant void models that are consistent with constraints from current observations .",
    ", that would be inferred by a central observer in an example giant void with constant bang time . ]",
    "so far we have discussed the specific observables of supernovae , the cmb@xmath70 , and the ksz effect , and described how the latter two of these provide constraints on simple void models with a constant bang time that are sufficient to effectively rule them out .",
    "we have chosen to discuss these particular observables as we consider them to be reasonably well defined in void models , easily calculable , and very constraining .",
    "there are , of course , other observables that one could also consider .",
    "these include baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) , galaxy correlation functions , and the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect , to name just a few .",
    "to understand these observables in the flrw cosmological models one only needs linear perturbation theory about an flrw background , which is very well understood .",
    "the observables in question can therefore be straightforwardly calculated .",
    "linear perturbation theory in ltb cosmology , however , is significantly more complicated . in @xcite a gauge invariant formalism for general perturbations in spherically symmetric space - times",
    "is applied to these models , and it is shown that scalar , vector and tensor modes no longer decouple .",
    "this means that complicated effects can occur that are not present in flrw cosmology .",
    "the full consequences of this behavior have yet to be understood , and so here we avoid the use of observables that rely on linear perturbation theory .",
    "this includes baos , galaxy correlation functions and the isw effect . for treatments of some of these observables",
    "when @xmath64constant the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "in this section we examine the constraints that can be imposed on general void models in which the bang time is allowed to vary .",
    "this generalizes the previous results that were summarized in section [ constraints ] .    as before , the observables we will use to constrain these models are the supernova distance moduli as functions of redshift , the cmb power spectrum on small scales , the local hubble rate , and the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "the specific data used for each observable will be explained in the subsections that follow .",

    "the ksz effect is sensitive to large - scale inhomogeneity , as observers inhabiting an inhomogeneous universe would generically expect to see large anisotropies on their cmb skies .    in section [ model ] , we introduced the theoretical framework for specifying these models and calculating observables in them .",

    "these features have observable effects that ultimately lead to predictions of a large cmb dipole anisotropy at low redshifts .",
    "in section [ constraints ] we reviewed some of the observational constraints that can be imposed on void models with constant bang time .",
    "three key sets of observables were considered : the distance moduli of supernovae , the small - angle cmb power spectrum plus local hubble rate , and upper limits on the magnitude of the ksz effect for individual clusters of galaxies .",
    "voids can fit the supernova data easily , but are unable to fit recent measurements of the cmb and @xmath2 simultaneously ( they predict a value of @xmath2 that is far too low ) .",
    "similarly , voids which fit the supernova data predict a large cmb dipole at redshifts up to @xmath162 , which is inconsistent with current ksz measurements .    in section [ results ] we considered the effect on these constraints of allowing the bang time to vary .",
    "this resulted in a significant increase in the freedom of the models , and allowed the supernovae and cmb+@xmath2 data sets to be fit simultaneously , even with our simple parametrization of the ltb radial functions .",
    "models with small ksz signals , consistent with the data , were also found , but these required more complex profiles and gave worse fits to the supernova data . we then proceeded to combine all of the observational constraints , and found that voids which are able to fit the supernovae",
    ", cmb and @xmath2 predict an extremely large ksz effect which is orders of magnitude greater than the measured upper limits .",
    "a joint fit to the supernova , cmb , @xmath2 , and ksz data with a significantly more complicated bang time profile also failed to produce good agreement with the data .",
    "we also argued that any void model with a significant bang time inhomogeneity will produce a large ksz effect at _ some _ redshift . given that a varying bang time is necessary to resolve the low-@xmath2 problem",
    ", it seems that the combination of supernovae , cmb+@xmath2 and ksz data is enough to effectively rule out ltb void models that attempt to explain cosmological data without dark energy , subject to the assumptions made in section [ intro ] .",
    "this goes some way toward demonstrating the homogeneity of the universe on large scales .",
    "we used the dipole approximation to calculate the magnitude of the ksz effect in our models , but this only holds if the dipole term dominates the anisotropy of an off - center observer s sky @xcite .",
    "otherwise , higher multipoles become important , and the dipole approximation overestimates the ksz effect .",
    "the dipole will dominate as long as most lines of sight on the observer s sky pass through the void , as will be the case if the observer is firmly inside it , for example .",
    "for the models in section [ results - sn - ksz ] and [ results - combined ] , and the clrier _",
    "_ model in section [ results - complicated ] , the inhomogeneity extends out to @xmath163 , and so the dipole approximation will always be a good one for observers at @xmath164 , where the ksz data lie .",
    "the models with more complicated bang time profiles considered in section [ results - complicated ] have much narrower inhomogeneities , however , and so we would expect the dipole approximation to be worse .",
    "these models predict low ksz magnitudes and are close to being consistent with the ksz data , so any overestimate due to the dipole approximation will have little effect on their total @xmath95 , which is anyway dominated by the poor fits to the supernova , cmb and @xmath2 data .",
    "we therefore conclude that the dipole approximation is sufficient for our purposes .    as we have tried to make clear throughout , our results are subject to several caveats that are summarized in section [ intro ]",
    "the first , that we are exactly in the center of a perfectly spherically symmetric void , serves to simplify our calculations but is clearly unrealistic as it fails to take into account angular variations in , for example , the galaxy distribution .",
    "this could affect observables such as the dipole anisotropy of the cmb seen by off - center observers , potentially weakening the constraints we have derived using the ksz effect .",
    "considering ourselves as off - center observers @xcite and introducing linear perturbations @xcite would produce more realistic models and allow more observational data to be used ( e.g. the matter power spectrum ) at the expense of a significant increase in complexity .",
    "a better understanding of linear perturbations would also go some way toward addressing our second caveat , that the formation of the last scattering surface must be in an approximately - flrw region .",
    "in general , one could expect features such as the coupling of scalar and tensor modes in ltb perturbations to produce secondary effects such as large b - mode polarizations @xcite .",
    "this type of effect is completely absent in linear perturbation theory about flrw backgrounds .",
    "a particular limitation of ltb solutions as cosmological models is that they contain only dust , and cease to be applicable when radiation becomes important .",
    "if we want to approximate the universe as an ltb model at late times , we must therefore match it to an appropriate solution containing radiation at early times .",
    "solutions involving separate inhomogeneous matter and radiation fluids @xcite , spatially - varying physical quantities such as the photon - baryon ratio @xcite , and scale - dependent initial power spectra @xcite have been considered , and serve to give some idea of the extra freedom that might be obtained in more general models .",
    "specifically , altering the location and properties of the surface of last scattering can have a profound effect on the predicted ksz signal @xcite and the observed cmb @xcite , and if one is prepared to consider this additional freedom , then our present results should not be expected to hold .",
    "finally , let us consider ltb models in the context of general inhomogeneity . rather than allowing space - time to be described by a single ltb metric",
    ", it has been suggested that the ltb geometry could be used as an effective geometry to model the scale dependence of inhomogeneity after some averaging procedure has been applied to the fine - grained structure of the actual inhomogeneous geometry of the real universe @xcite .",
    "this is a considerable departure from the situation we have been considering here . in particular ,",
    "if other observers are able to construct similar effective spherically symmetric geometries about their own locations then we should no longer expect distant clusters to see a large dipole in their cmb sky .",
    "this would completely relax the constraints that can be imposed from observations of the ksz effect .",

    "its conclusions are in broad agreement with those presented here : fluctuations in the bang time that are large enough to have a significant effect on the geometry of the universe at late times ( and thus have any bearing on the low-@xmath2 problem ) would result in compton @xmath165-distortions many times larger that can be reconciled with current observational constraints ."

    "<S> the apparent accelerating expansion of the universe , determined from observations of distant supernovae , and often taken to imply the existence of dark energy , may alternatively be explained by the effects of a giant underdense void if we relax the assumption of homogeneity on large scales . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have made use of the spherically - symmetric , radially - inhomogeneous lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) models to derive strong constraints on this scenario , particularly from observations of the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect which is sensitive to large scale inhomogeneity . however , most of these previous studies explicitly set the ltb ` bang time ' function to be constant , neglecting an important freedom of the general solutions . </S>",
    "<S> here we examine these models in full generality by relaxing this assumption . </S>",
    "<S> we find that although the extra freedom allowed by varying the bang time is sufficient to account for some observables individually , it is not enough to simultaneously explain the supernovae observations , the small - angle cmb , the local hubble rate , and the ksz effect . </S>",
    "<S> this set of observables is strongly constraining , and effectively rules out simple ltb models as an explanation of dark energy . </S>"
