    "the theoretical explanation for the observed neutrino oscillations and neutrino masses requires physics beyond the standard model .",
    "furthermore the presence of dark matter and the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) support the need for a more fundamental theory . in the present article",
    "we will establish a connection between two of the above mentioned observations and investigate the baryogenesis through leptogenesis scenario @xcite in an @xmath12 flavour model .",
    "the model we are going to discuss here is the first gut a@xmath13 golden ratio flavour model with successful leptogenesis to our knowledge .",
    "this recently proposed model @xcite has the feature that @xmath14 is connected to the golden ratio @xmath15 via @xmath16 .",
    "similar to the golden ratio ( gr ) type a models in @xcite the reactor angle is predicted to be vanishing at leading order and the atmospheric angle to be maximal .",
    "hence , the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath17 has the form @xmath18 which is given in the convention of the particle data group @xcite with the diagonal matrix @xmath19 = diag@xmath20 containing the majorana phases . since the experimental values for the angles , cf .  tab .",
    "[ tab : exp_parameters ] , strongly disfavour @xmath21 to be vanishing the leading order mixing angles have to be corrected to realistic values . in @xcite",
    "we followed the approach based on grand unification where the neutrino mixing angles receive corrections from the charged lepton sector .",
    "namely this model features su(5 ) unification .",
    "thereby we could explore the su(5 ) relation @xmath22 from the non - standard yukawa - coupling relations @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite , and for the double ratio @xmath25 which are all in perfect agreement with experimental data .",
    "in addition to the corrections from the charged lepton sector renormalisation group running effects ( rge ) have to be taken into account . due to a neutrino mass sum rule in both hierarchies",
    "only a certain mass range is allowed . for the inverted",
    "ordering this implies large rge effects for @xmath14 which rule out this ordering .",
    "since the light neutrino masses are generated via the type - i - seesaw mechanism in @xcite the baryogenesis through leptogenesis mechanism can be easily implemented . in this mechanism",
    "the dynamically generated lepton asymmetry is converted into a baryon asymmetry due to sphaleron interactions .",
    "thermal leptogenesis can take place when the heavy rh majorana neutrinos ( and their susy partners the sneutrinos ) decay out - of - equilibrium in a cp and lepton - number violating way .",
    "flavour effects @xcite ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) can play an important role in thermal leptogenesis .",
    "we set the scale at which leptogenesis takes place to be the see - saw scale @xmath26 gev . in the model considered we have also @xmath27 @xcite , and thus , the scale @xmath28 falls in the interval @xmath29",
    "gev@xmath30  gev . for values of @xmath28 in this interval",
    "@xcite the baryon asymmetry is produced in the two - flavour leptogenesis regime and we perform the analysis of baryon asymmetry generation in this regime .",
    "we will see that the original model can not accommodate for the observed value of the baryon asymmetry due to the structure of the neutrino yukawa matrix .",
    "in fact , there would be no baryon asymmetry generated via the leptogenesis mechanism . in order to generate a non - zero asymmetry",
    "we will introduce only one additional operator in the neutrino sector which corrects the neutrino yukawa matrix and subsequently affects the phenomenology of the model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 is a short overview of the model building aspects including the nlo operator . in section 3",
    "we discuss the analytical results for the phenomenology of the model .",
    "there we also describe the relevant formulas for leptogenesis . in section 4",
    "we show the results of a numerical parameter scan .",
    "we discuss the predictions for the mixing parameters including the phases as well as for the sum of the neutrino masses , the observable in neutrinoless double beta - decay , the kinematic mass @xmath31 and for the generated baryon asymmetry . in section 5",

    "this is only possible due to the non - standard clebsch - gordan coeffcients @xcite as it was realised in a series of papers @xcite .",

    "note nevertheless , that compared to @xcite we do not introduce an additional flavon and no additional shaping symmetries .",
    "here it is sufficient to extend minimally the messenger content of the model .      in this section",
    "we discuss the nlo superpotential of the neutrino sector . in order to accommodate leptogenesis which can generate the observed value of the baryon asymmetry",
    ", we will introduce a correction to the neutrino yukawa matrix governed by the operator @xmath42 .",
    "this operator was absent in the original model but can be added by introducing only two new pairs of messenger fields @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the renormalisable superpotential of the nlo neutrino sector reads @xmath47 where we have omitted the coupling constants to increase clarity and only write down the operators which are new .",

    "the only new effective operator is @xmath51 where we have denoted with brackets the a@xmath13 contractions .",
    "this operator gives a correction to the neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "this correction disturbs the golden ratio mixing pattern already in the neutrino sector by itself and subsequently the phenomenology of the original model , especially the prediction for leptogenesis is modified .",
    "in this section we will discuss the phenomenological implications of introducing @xmath54 . because @xmath55 is small , in many cases the results are similar to those obtained in the original model .",
    "however , as we will see , in some cases when the leading order result was relatively small , a correction of order @xmath55 can have a sizeable impact .",
    "the original model was very predictive due to the built - in sum rules . and",
    "indeed one mass sum rule remains valid .",
    "since @xmath56 is not corrected the sum rule for the right - handed neutrino masses @xmath57 is still correct .",
    "note that , the masses are taken here to be complex .",
    "the situation for the light neutrino masses is somewhat different : they get corrections of the order of @xmath58 .",
    "however , since these corrections are small , the sum rule @xmath59 is still a good approximation . and",
    "hence our estimate for the ranges of the neutrino masses from @xcite @xmath60 is still reasonable .",
    "for all three pmns mixing angles we find corrections of order @xmath55 . for @xmath21 and @xmath61",
    "the expressions are somewhat lengthy and not insightful , but as an example we find as correction for @xmath14 to first order in @xmath55    @xmath62    the corrections have immediate consequences for the phenomenology .",
    "the first thing one might wonder , is if the inverted mass ordering is still excluded like in the original model .",
    "we begin our discussion with the sum rule @xcite .",
    "but since @xmath21 is not very small we want to use now the improved sum rule . ]",
    "@xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    for @xmath66 we can evaluate this sum rule and find @xmath67 ( compared to @xmath68 from the sum rule in @xcite ) . using the lower bound on the mass scale in the inverted ordering case , cf .",
    "eq .  , we can estimate that the rge evolved value of @xmath14 at the seesaw scale has to be smaller than about 5.7@xmath69 .",
    "attributing this difference completely to the correction @xmath70 with @xmath71 or @xmath72 we find @xmath73 .",
    "this is a crude estimate because the other mixing angles are affected as well modifying the above sum rule in a non - trivial way .",
    "nevertheless , from here we would still expect @xmath55 to be of order @xmath74 to safe the inverted mass ordering . on the other hand such a large value for @xmath55",
    "is not plausible from a model building point of view because it is associated to a highly suppressed operator making values of @xmath75 to @xmath76 plausible .",
    "we will come back to this point later when we discuss the numerical results .    for future convenience ,",
    "we introduce the following definitions for the parameters which we will use as well in our numerical scan @xmath77 where @xmath78    in this way , we express the absolute value of the three heavy neutrino masses in terms of three real parameters , i.e. , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "in fact , our prediction for @xmath203 is rather precise to be in the narrow range from 2.3  mev to 9.2  mev .",
    "this is way below the sensitivity of any experiment in the near future so that any evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay would rule out this model .",
    "related to the mass scale are as well two other observables .",
    "first of all there is the sum of the neutrino masses @xmath204 which might be determined from cosmology .",

    "the biggest advantage of our numerical scan over the analytical estimates is that it allows us to use all available data on neutrino masses and mixing to constrain the allowed parameter space .",
    "we have already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phialphacompare ] that the values of @xmath80 get constrained which is again visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : yb_num ] . while a priori we only knew that @xmath209 and less than about 9 we now see that only the range from @xmath210 to @xmath211 is allowed ( @xmath212 at 1@xmath32 ) . and since @xmath80 and @xmath81 are not independent but related via eq .",
    ", the phase @xmath81 gets constrained as well to the range @xmath213 $ ] ( @xmath214 $ ] at 1@xmath32 ) .",
    "the new parameters @xmath55 and @xmath108 are nevertheless more interesting than @xmath80 and @xmath81 which are mostly constrained by the neutrino masses and for which we would have found similar results already in the previous model . in fig .  [",
    "fig : yb_num ] we have shown the dependence of @xmath158 on this new parameters .    the first thing to note , is that @xmath55 is indeed a small parameter in the range from @xmath215 to @xmath216 . from the model building point of view",
    "such a small value is justified .",
    "remember that the leading order yukawa coupling is a dimension three operator in the superpotential while the correction proportional to @xmath55 is coming from a dimension seven operator .",
    "also note that alone from a constraint on @xmath158 @xmath55 could have been much larger or smaller depending of course on the value of @xmath108 and the other parameters .",
    "this is different here because the mixing angles get corrections of order @xmath55 and this implies the constraint shown here .",
    "finally , note that the allowed range for @xmath108 is only weakly constrained .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting that the sign of @xmath158 is completely determined by @xmath108 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising because in our estimates from section  [ sec : analyticalleptogenesis ] the sign of @xmath217 depends on other parameters which could induce a sign flip , which can be seen for instance in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : y_t ] . but after applying all experimental constraints the correlation is striking .",
    "combined with the analytic analysis , we see that this correlation is a result of the fact that @xmath158 is dominated by @xmath171 , which is again dominated by the first term in @xmath218 , where @xmath91 is negative and @xmath179 is positive . neglecting the subdominant terms",
    ", we have @xmath219 . the analytical estimates for the efficiency factors we are using provide results with an estimated precision of ( 20 - 30)@xmath220 compared to the full numerical results solving the boltzmann equations .",
    "this is more than sufficient for the purposes of our study .",
    "the other predictions for the light neutrino masses and mixing parameters would only mildly change because they are mostly governed by the leading order values ( a 30% correction to @xmath55 would have only little impact on them ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the complex yukawa and the majorana phases are both necessary cp - violating sources to generate a successful baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis while in accordance with all the low energy constraints .",
    "it is also noticeable that @xmath158 would be strongly suppressed if @xmath221 . as it follows from fig .",
    "[ fig : phialpha ] , values of @xmath221 are excluded in the model we are considering since @xmath91 can have values only in a narrow interval around @xmath222 , namely , @xmath223 for @xmath224 , which also means that the majorana phases contribute maximally to the asymmetry .",
    "in order to investigate the role of the dirac phase we need a different parametrisation of the neutrino yukawa coupling to see the relation explicitly , which is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "in this paper we have revised the su(5 )  @xmath225  a@xmath13 golden ratio gut flavour model from @xcite with the aim to include as well successful leptogenesis . in the original setup",
    "this was not possible .",
    "as it turns out we only have to add two additional pairs of messenger fields but no additional symmetries or flavon fields to do this .",
    "we find that this induces a small correction to the neutrino yukawa matrix , which can generate a sizeable baryon asymmetry , but as well implies some modifications for the predictions of the masses and mixing angles of the original model . in an extensive numerical scan",
    "we could show that we can simultaneously accommodate successfully the observed neutrino masses , mixing angles and possibly baryon asymmetry . and even more our setup",
    "is so constrained that we predict several correlations or ranges for observables yet to be measured .",
    "one of the most striking features of our original model - the sum rule for the neutrino masses - remains valid up to a insignificant correction . from this",
    "we can again derive a lower bound for the lightest neutrino masses @xmath226 ev and rule out the neutrino mass spectrum with inverted ordering .",
    "this is already a very strong prediction .    due to the additional complex parameter and the additional constraint on @xmath158",
    "the allowed ranges for @xmath96 has shrunk from @xmath227 in the original model to @xmath228 . whereas the allowed regions for @xmath95 and @xmath192 remain similar compared to the original model .",
    "namely , we find now @xmath95 to be in @xmath229 or @xmath230 and @xmath192 to be in @xmath231 or @xmath232 .",
    "the strong correlation between @xmath21 and the majorana phases is now weakened due to the additional complex parameter we introduced in the model .",
    "it is also important to note , that we find here points which are in agreement within 1@xmath32 with all neutrino observables .",
    "this is due to the fact that we now allow for smaller values of @xmath61 but we also use here the updated fit results from @xcite where maximal atmospheric mixing is again allowed at the 1@xmath32 level .",
    "nevertheless , a precise measurement of @xmath61 which deviates significantly from maximal mixing can rule out the presented model . since we limit the allowed ranges for the cp violating phases and the light neutrino masses we predict as well the effective majorana mass observable in neutrinoless double beta decay to be in the narrow range ( @xmath233 )  mev .",
    "this is beyond the reach of ongoing experiments and upcoming experiments which will begin taking data in the near future , but it will be certainly tested in the future .    for the baryon asymmetry @xmath158",
    "we find in the approximation used to calculate it good agreement with the most recent data and this is done by only introducing one additional operator which involves one new complex parameter with a modulus @xmath55 having a value in the range @xmath215 to @xmath216 .",
    "the phase of this additional parameter at the 3@xmath32 level is not much constrained but it governs the sign of @xmath158 .",
    "what we did not discuss in the present article is that some of the features of the original model , like the yukawa coupling ratios @xmath234 , remain valid in the modified model implying non - trivial constraints on the spectrum of the supersymmetric partners of the standard model particles .    in summary",
    "we have succeeded to modify the model from @xcite to include viable leptogenesis by only introducing a minimal correction .",
    "the model presented here is , to our knowledge , the first gut @xmath235 golden ratio flavour model in which it is possible to have successful leptogenesis .",
    "all observables lie within the measured ranges and for the not yet measured quantities in the neutrino sector ( the type of the neutrino mass spectrum , the absolute scale and the sum of the neutrino masses , the effective majorana mass in neutrinoless double beta decay , the cp violation phases in the pmns matrix ) , we make predictions",
    ". an appealing feature of the model is its rather small number of parameters , which makes the model very predictive and testable .",
