    "continuing requirements for greater digital data storage capacity has lead to continued growth in data storage density in magnetic recording media .",
    "future improvements are limited by the magnetic recording trilemma , caused by competing requirements of reduced signal to noise ratio , thermal stability of written information , and writability.@xcite two solutions for the magnetic recording trilemma have been proposed : first heat assisted magnetic recording ( hamr),@xcite where laser heating during recording is used to lower the anisotropy sufficiently to achieve writing ; the second solution is bit - patterned media ( bpm ) , where each bit is defined by a single dot in a lithographically defined array@xcite and the larger magnetic volume reduces the requirement for high anisotropy required for long - term thermal stability .",
    "bit patterned media can be made using a variety of methods including patterning@xcite and self - assembly of magnetic nanoparticles.@xcite controlling the microstructural properties of magnetic nanoparticles is quite challenging , however lithographic patterning techniques allow a continuous @xmath0 fept film to be patterned into an array of isolated magnetic islands or dots.@xcite however , during lithography ions near the dot edge can reduce the @xmath0 ordering , resulting in magnetically soft edges.@xcite the presence of damaged edges in the dots could reduce both the coercivity@xcite and the thermal stability.@xcite    in addition to decreasing the coercivity , a broad switching field distribution ( sfd ) can also lead to write errors in neighboring bits during the writing process .",
    "the sfd ( the variation of switching fields between dots ) includes both extrinsic and intrinsic components.@xcite the extrinsic sfd may be caused by dipolar interaction between dots , and the intrinsic sfd arises from variations of intrinsic magnetic properties of dots , including anisotropy @xmath1 , volume @xmath2 , and the easy axis alignment.@xcite furthermore , thermal fluctuations also broaden the intrinsic sfd , known as the thermal sfd.@xcite within the simple stoner - wohlfarth approximation ( monodomain ) , the thermal sfd is mainly related to the anisotropy energy barrier , @xmath3 , and the measurement time scale .",
    "this makes the thermal sfd pronounced at high field sweep rates associated with the recording process.@xcite    reversal behavior in relatively large dots with magnetically soft edges of fixed width , associated with ion - damage from the etching process , has been studied previously,@xcite where the presence of soft edges was shown to change the reversal mode . in addition",
    ", small - sized dots with ring - shaped soft edges of varied width have been investigated by macrospin analytic models without including the thermal fluctuations.@xcite the increased width of edge is found to reduce the coercivity of dots,@xcite suggesting a strong relationship between the edge width and the reversal mode .",
    "further control of the magnetic properties of edges with fixed width in large sized dots can also be done via soft he@xmath4 irradiation.@xcite the experimental observations can only be explained by the model including the thermal fluctuations.@xcite all the reported works indicate that either the edge width@xcite or the thermal fluctuations@xcite affects the reversal mode and could result in different switching field distributions of patterned dots .",
    "however , the edge - width dependence of the reversal mode including thermal fluctuations is still not understood .",
    "here we develop a computational model to study magnetization reversal modes in @xmath0 fept dots with magnetically soft edges .",
    "we employ an atomistic spin model formalism , which provides detailed information on reversal modes unreachable by standard micromagnetic simulations.@xcite in particular , soft edges of only a few nanometers are tractable , and we can further study the effect of the reduced exchange coupling at the interface , possibly resulting from the core / edge interface roughness . moreover , thermal effects are consistently taken into account within our model using the langevin dynamics formalism that allows us to study the relationship between the coercivity , the thermal sfd , and reversal modes .",
    "we further compare the atomistic spin modeled results with available analytic approaches , which were originally presented for hard / soft nano wires,@xcite to examine the validity of these approaches for the core / shell nanostructure .",
    "these simpler approaches are capable of highlighting the key physics .",
    "additionally , since the atomistic resolution in the simulation makes this method computationally intensive restricting the size of the calculated system to nanometer length scales , these validated analytic approaches could be potentially utilized to investigate properties of large sized systems , e.g. , a dot array .",

    "as the edge width increases the nucleation field of core spins fits to the domain - wall pinning field at the core / edge interface . considering the computationally intensive nature of the atomistic spin model simulation , these analytic theories can provide a global sketch for different parameters at minimal costs .    comparing to previous studies focused on the reversal modes along the layer - growth direction in the typical exchange spring media , here we present detailed two - dimensional reversal behaviors on the patterned dot - plane as well as the corresponding thermally induced switching field distribution , both of which in fact dominate properties of typical patterned dots and can not be investigated by standard micromagnetic calculations .",
    "we also note that different magnetic properties of the edge , which have been assumed constant values in this study and have not been experimentally probed , only vary the characteristic length of different reversal modes and the corresponding coercivity fields without affecting the validity of theories . according to our study here ,",
    "the presence of damaged edges with uniform magnetic properties reduces the thermally induced switching field distribution , and the width of the damaged edge significantly changes the coercivity in patterned dots .",
    "therefore , the experimentally observed broadening of the switching field distribution in patterned @xmath5 fept dots with damaged edges@xcite should be attributed to extrinsic properties of the nanodots created by patterning processes , for example , the variation in either the width or the magnetic properties of the damaged edges .",
