    "we follow the line selection procedure described by ah95 .",

    "only if the ratio @xmath38 for at least one of three representative depth points is larger than a preset threshold value , a line is treated with a voigt profile .",
    "otherwise the line is considered so weak that to a good approximation it can be treated as a gauss profile in order to save computation time .",
    "the number of considered atomic lines is much smaller than the number of molecular lines .",
    "this allows us to set @xmath39 for atomic lines very low in order to treat as many lines as possible with voigt profiles .",
    "the number of molecular lines is about two orders of magnitude larger but since the atmosphere structure does not change significantly ( as test calculations showed ) with the inclusion of more voigt profiles for molecular lines we set the threshold for molecular lines for iterations to @xmath40 . for high resolution spectra we use lower values ( usually @xmath41 ) although we found that the spectra do not change significantly by increasing the number of lines with voigt profiles .",

    "all the spectra are furthermore based on self - consistent model strucutres with thier respective parameters .",
    "to demonstrate the various effects influencing the line profiles we will use the  @xmath44 subordinate doublet and the  @xmath45 resonance doublet , since they are available in the keck - spectra ( see sec .",

    "note that the synthetic line profiles in this section are shown at their _ vacuum _ wavelengths .",
    "( [ gammavdw ] ) shows that the vdw damping constant is a linear function of the perturber density .",
    "this implies that the major contribution to the total vdw broadening will be due to the effect by the most abundant perturbers , namely , and @xmath0 , because the polarizabilities change much less than the relative concentrations of the perturbing species ( cf .",
    "[ perttab ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ diffvdw ] we show the influence of @xmath0 on the profile of the subordinate  @xmath44 doublet .",
    "all the other perturbers listed in tab .",
    "[ perttab ] do not contribute significantly to the line width , the profile is identical with the one which is only h  he@xmath0 broadened .",
    "this is valid even for metal abundances higher than solar .    in addition ,",
    "[ diffvdw ] shows the effect of the correction factor introduced in eq .",
    "( [ c6corr ] ) by artificially applying it to the alkali metal sodium . in this case",
    "the correction factor was only applied to demonstrate the uncertainty which still is present in the vdw damping constant .",
    "a final decision on the validity of such a factor has to be made by comparing the synthetic profiles with observations .",
    "changes of the absolute number density of each perturber will change the damping constant .",
    "we consider two ways to change the perturber densities : changing the gravity or changing the metallicity .",
    "higher surface gravities will increase the total pressure in every layer of the atmosphere .",
    "this will also increase the number density of every perturber for constant metallicity .",
    "an example of the gravity effect on the line widths is shown in fig .",
    "[ loggvdw ] which illustrates the influence of @xmath46 on the profile of the subordinate doublet as well on the  @xmath45 resonance doublet for model atmospheres with @xmath47k , solar metallicity and a difference in the gravities of one order of magnitude .",
    "on the other hand , an increase in metallicity at constant gravity will decrease both the total pressure and the number density of the main perturbers , , and @xmath0 .",
    "it furthermore will bind hydrogen in hydrides and water vapour .",
    "therefore , all these effects will make the line wings narrower .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig .",
    "[ zvdw ] , with the same two doublets as above .",
    "the only difference in the models shown is half an order of magnitude in the metallicity .",
    "this introduces the problem that small changes in metallicity can be compensated for by changes in the gravity , thus making the determination of both parameters from the wings of strong lines alone questionable .",
    "this means that abundance analyses of cool dwarfs in general must be performed with caution and simple techniques may lead to errors .",
    "this will be investigated in much more detail in subsequent work .      to demonstrate the improvement brought by the present handling",
    ", we will briefly review other commonly used methods : ( 1 ) the unsld formula without perturber correction used by @xcite and ah95 , and ( 2 ) using the precalculated damping constants per hydrogen atom at 10000  k provided on cd - rom  no.1  by @xcite .",
    "the method ( 1 ) used an average broadening mechanism by taking the total particle density instead of the density of every perturber and by not distinguishing between the different perturbers , i. e. , not taking into account the different polarizabilities and reduced masses , latter influencing the relative velocity in eq .",
    "( [ gammavdw ] ) .",
    "in addition , it used the correction factor for all lines .    in fig .",
    "[ frakur ] we compared now the same  @xmath44 profiles as above calculated with the old method with one calculated with the new method but the correction factor artificially applied for comparison . as can be seen there are clear differences between the two methods .",
    "the new method results in narrower lines since it accounts for the different polarizabilities and reduced masses which decrease @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ classc6 ] ) or @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ gammavdw ] ) compared to a @xmath20 and @xmath21 calculated as described above and , therefore , also decreases the damping constants of eq .",
    "( [ gammatot ] ) .",
    "in fig [ frakur ] we also plot the profiles using the damping constants provided by kurucz .",
    "we find only small differences between kurucz s vdw damping constant and ours , if we omit the correction factor . in test calculations",
    "we also compared the use of natural damping constants provided by kurucz with those calculated with the classical approximation .",
    "since the total line width in m  dwarfs is dominated by vdw broadening , it makes little observable difference which treatment of natural damping is employed to model their spectra .",
    "we adopt our own methods in the following discussion .",
    "we furthermore compared directly the damping constants obtained with our approximation with the corresponding values from kurucz s list and found only small differences for the vast majority of the lines above 6000   .",
    "the largest differences arise from the correction factor we included for non - alkali species . for the uv region",
    "the differences are larger . here",
    "the hydrogenic approximation for the absorber we used differs substantially from the method kurucz used .",
    "this does not affect the spectra we present here .",
    "in general , the photospheric uv flux from m  dwarfs is negligible .",
    "however , a more thorough investigation must be performed for stars that are significantly hotter than m  stars .      as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ molcorr ] and [ mollin ] the molecular lines are much narrower than the atomic lines , both in the observations ( cf . sec .",
    "[ molobs ] ) as well as in our models .",
    "this is due to the fact that each molecular line is very weak compared to the strong atomic lines .",
    "therefore only the gauss cores remain visible in the spectra and the line width is only the line width of the gauss core .",
    "nevertheless , the voigt profiles need to be included since they lift the gauss cores significantly without changing the line width as corresponding comparisons showed .",
    "in addition , the molecular lines lie so densely together that only their cores can remain visible ; any wing contribution will effectively be blocked by the core of neighboring molecular lines .",
    "this means that the total width of molecular _ features _ is not as much dominated by the wings of the vdw broadening as for the atomic lines .    in order to estimate the error resulting from our approximations , we performed test calculations in which we omitted the correction factor from eq .",
    "( [ c6corr ] ) for molecules which results in a change in the interaction constant by nearly 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "in contrast to the atomic lines ( cf .",
    "[ synprf ] and fig .",
    "[ diffvdw ] ) , we found only small differences in the overall appearance of molecular lines in the optical ( see fig .",
    "[ molcorr ] ) , since only the line wings change and they are completely blended in the spectrum .    the most important result , however , was the influence of rotational broadening on the appearance of the molecular lines which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ molcorr ] as well .",
    "as we applied rotational broadening on our test spectra we found that even a small rotational velocity will broaden the lines so much that the uncertainties in the vdw broadening become unimportant .",
    "only the cores of the stronger molecular lines remain visible .",
    "also the influence of the gravity and metallicity become less important .",
    "we furthermore found that the effect of rotational broadening rises continuously with increasing rotational velocity .",
    "as a consequence , the molecular line ` haze ' reveals a possibility to accurately measure the rotational velocity as it is very sensitive to it ( see sec .",

    "our observation of vb10 was obtained with the hires echelle on the keck telescope during a run on 1995 march 12 under clear conditions .",
    "our exposure time was 30 minutes with 0.8 arcsec seeing .",
    "the instrumental setup and data reduction were very similar to those described by @xcite .",

    "it is not the purpose of this paper to investigate the influence of the effective temperature on the line profile .",
    "this will be done in subsequent work where the parameters will be verified or revised , if necessary .",
    "a rotational velocity of @xmath54 was adopted , using the method of @xcite .",
    "we reconsider this in section [ molobs ] . due to the complexity of the spectra we performed the fits and decided on their quality by eye .",
    "the  @xmath44 doublet lines are subordinate transitions and , therefore , form mainly in the photosphere and should not be significantly affected by the chromosphere of vb10 .",
    "our best fits are the two models with @xmath55 and @xmath56=0.0 $ ] and with @xmath57 and @xmath56=+0.5 $ ] shown in fig . [ na ]",
    "there are no significant differences in the appearance of the two model spectra , although the parameters differ substantially .",
    "this demonstrates the effect mentioned above , namely that an increase in metallicity decreases the number density of the major perturbers , , and @xmath0 , and thus partly cancels the effect of increasing the gravity , in particular for strong lines .",
    "this shows that one has to be very careful when analyzing m dwarf spectra in detail . in our case here",
    ", we found good agreement between observation and models for parameters within the intervals @xmath58 and @xmath59 < + 0.5 $ ] .",
    "we therefore use this as an error limit on our analyses . for any parameter combination beyond these intervals",
    "we find no reasonable agreement .",
    "the synthetic line profiles show a deeper core than the observed lines .",
    "we calculated several models with a different microturbulence in order to `` fill in '' the core but we found no significant improvement to the fit .",
    "the remaining difference is most likely due to nlte effects which might make line cores less deep .",
    "this will be investigated in detail in future work ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nlte effects will have to be considered as they are highly non - linear and are very likely to affect the cores of strong lines",
    ".    we also like to point out the numerous weak lines in the wings of the atomic lines .",
    "these are mostly tio lines which are also visible in the observed spectrum and are not to be considered as noise ( see also below , sec .",
    "[ molobs ] ) .",
    "the  @xmath45 lines show a clear core reversal ( see fig .",
    "this is due to the chromospheric activity of vb10 .",
    "the doublet is a resonance transition and thus will be strongly influenced by chromospheric activity . since we are not treating the chromospheric effects here , our models can only reproduce the line wings which are formed deeper in the photosphere .    as in the case of the sodium lines ,",

    "the fit itself is not as good as in the case of the sodium doublet as the models show many more molecular lines .",
    "this spectral region is partially contaminated by the telluric o@xmath60 a bands present between 7595 and 7680 which we did not remove from the observed data .",
    "they are affecting the observations by decreasing the continuum flux to a not readily known extend .",
    "in addition , this part of the spectrum is dominated by the @xmath61-band of tio for which the line data are of lower quality ( ahs96 ) . nevertheless , the lines are so broad , that we still can fit them as shown in fig .",

    "the  @xmath48 resonance line shows also chromospheric features as can be seen in fig .",
    "the line is weak and very much filled up and the line is hardly detectable without a specific identification .",
    "calcium , in contrast to the two elements discussed above , is not an alkali metal .",
    "this means that the vdw damping constant is calculated including the correction factor introduced in eq .",
    "( [ c6corr ] ) .",
    "although it is hard to compare this weak line with models , we find that the correction factor is necessary in order to reproduce the observed line width with the same model parameters as used for the sodium and potassium lines . without @xmath62",
    "the theoretical line profile of the lines is not broad enough , however , we can not say how accurate our value for @xmath62 is . in order to make a more accurate determination of this factor , we will have to investigate much stronger non - alkali lines with clearer and broader wings .",
    "this will be done in a subsequent analysis .",
    "this line can not be used to determine directly the parameters of vb10 .",
    "but it can be used to confirm them . as in the case of sodium and potassium",

    "the fit to the  @xmath49 resonance line and the  @xmath50 line ( which has 0.86 ev excitation energy ) is shown in fig .",
    "both lines are very weak but still visible and we find very good agreement between observations and our two models with @xmath55 and @xmath56=0.0 $ ] and @xmath57 and @xmath56=+0.5 $ ] . as in the case of calcium",
    "above , we only used these lines to confirm our range of fitting parameters , since the line widths are not dominated by the wings of the profiles .",
    "they are dominated by their gauss cores but the voigt profiles need to be included in order to lift the cores .    both metals , barium and iron , are non - alakli metals as calcium above and , therefore , treated with @xmath62 from eq .  ( [ c6corr ] ) .",
    "although the lines are narrow , we find it also here necessary to include such a correction factor in order to fit all lines consistently .",
    "however , we can not make any accurate determinations of @xmath62 , which still has to be done with stronger lines .",
    "we also want to point out the very good fit of the surrounding molecular lines ( see also sec .",
    "( [ molobs ] ) ) .",
    "the two subordinate  @xmath51 and  @xmath52 lines visible in the observations are shown in fig .",
    "the lines are not very strong , yet they can be clearly identified .",
    "this spectral region is strongly contaminated by terrestial absorption features which reduce the total flux and suppress the molecular pseudo continuum .",
    "therefore , we did not try to fit the lines in detail .",
    "instead we show them with an offset to demonstrate the resemblance of the line shapes of the two lines .",

    "again , calculating the vdw damping constant including @xmath62 ( see also sec .",
    "( [ bafit ] ) , results in consistent synthetic spectra .",
    "but due to the uncertainties in the observed spectrum we did not try to determine the accuracy of @xmath62 here either .",

    "we can treat vo only with the jola method ( ah95 , ahs96 ) since no line list is yet available . since the jola method will produce these edges , it is not suitable for computing high - resolution spectra .",
    "we point out that the  @xmath51 line is slightly contaminated by a  @xmath51 line .      as mentioned before , the high - resolution spectra are full with a large number of weak molecular lines . for tio",

    "[ mollin ] .",
    "because of the strong influence of rotational broadening , we only use the molecular lines to confirm the parameters and not to derive them directly . on the other hand",
    ", we can derive the rotational velocity a second time by using its strong influence on the profile of the molecular lines .",
    "we found that rotational velocities between 7 and @xmath63 produce very similar fits , whereas applying values beyond this interval result in worse fits .",
    "therefore , we can confirm a rotational velocity of @xmath64 .",
    "we found that the line widths caused by pressure broadening due to van der waals damping are very sensitive to both the gravity and the metallicity . therefore fitting the lines of high resolution spectra",
    "provides a very important tool to determine these two parameters .",
    "nevertheless , since both parameters influence the line widths in the similar ways , one has to be very careful with the analysis .    from the fits to the lines described above",
    "we estimate that vb10 has a gravity in the range @xmath58 and a metallicity @xmath65 < 0.5 $ ] based on line broadening considerations alone with an adopted effective temperature of @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we will investigate the influence of the effective temperature on the line profiles in subsequent work .",

    "the iron lines are stronger in hotter m  dwarfs which would be more suitable for testing the vdw broadening of iron lines .",
    "we also find that our damping constants for atomic lines are in broad agreement with the values provided by kurucz .",
    "no error should be expected from uncertainites in the oscillator stengths of the atomic lines since they are much smaller than any other uncertainties and are well known for the light element lines that we have mostly considered here .",

    "in addition , observations of different strong atomic lines in spectral regions where molecular absorption is not dominating and blending is less severe ( e.g. beyond 1.18@xmath72 m , see also jones et al . , 1996 ) , will clarify the calculations of the damping constants and the use of correction factors .",
