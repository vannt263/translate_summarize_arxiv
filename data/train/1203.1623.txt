    "central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are ubiquitous and are found in a variety of galaxies , ranging from low mass galaxies to the most massive early - type galaxies @xcite . within our current cosmological picture of hierarchical structure formation",
    ", galaxies form through continuous mergers .",
    "if both candidate galaxies harbor a central smbh before the merger , the evolution of the latter is thought to be as follows @xcite : the smbhs of the merging galaxies sink towards the center of the merger remnant due to dynamical friction and form a gravitationally bound binary system .",
    "the further evolution of the smbh binary is governed by interactions with stars and gas .",
    "if the binary semi - major axis value shrinks to a value where emission of gravitational waves ( gws ) efficiently takes away energy and angular momentum from the binary , the coalescence of smbhs becomes inevitable .",
    "in fact there is growing observational evidence for this process : there are reports about two widely separated smbhs in a single galaxy ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as indirect evidence for binary smbhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "binary smbhs are of particular interest in astrophysics and general relativity : if smbh binary evolution leads to coalescence following a galaxy merger , such an event would give rise to one of the _ loudest _ possible bursts of gws detectable for future space borne low - frequency laser interferometers @xcite .",
    "however , the exact pathway to smbh coalescence and especially the associated timescales , and hence the chances for a possible detection during any satellite mission run - time , is still a matter of debate .",
    "numerical @xmath0-body simulations considering the decay of a pair of smbhs in major mergers of massive elliptical galaxies due to the interaction with the stellar background only show that the critical separation for gravitational wave emission should be reached in about one gyr as long as the galaxies deviate sufficiently from sphericity , a configuration which allows to have centrophilic orbits @xcite that efficiently refill the loss cone @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that smbhs with masses ranging from @xmath4 , e.g. , at the center of faint elliptical galaxies or in the bulge of spiral galaxies , coalesce well within a gyr after the merger of the two galaxies / bulges .",
    "however , these simulations started from idealized initial conditions and do not consider the effects of gas dynamics , star formation , etc .",
    "conversely , numerical simulations investigating major mergers including hydrodynamics show that a smbh binary can form very rapidly after the galaxy collision takes place , sometimes in less than a million years @xcite , but are not yet conclusive on the subsequent shrinking of the binary at sub - parsec scale separations due to the prohibitive cost of the computation with increasing resolution and the uncertainties in the modeling of gas thermodynamics and turbulence @xcite .",
    "furthermore , minor mergers are the most frequent type of mergers in the universe , especially those with a mass ratio of some @xmath5 . in addition",
    ", they usually involve disk - dominated galaxies because these are not only the most common galaxies in the universe today @xcite but they were even more common at higher redshift since they are the likely progenitors of present - day massive early type galaxies @xcite .",
    "simulations of minor mergers between disk galaxies show that the role of gas can be crucial in delivering the pair of smbhs to the center of the merger remnant ; without gas the smbh of the secondary galaxy is left wandering at kilo - parsec distances , at which the dynamical friction timescale is longer than the hubble time , because the core of the galaxy that is hosting it is tidally disrupted before it can sink to the center of the primary @xcite . with the gas",
    "the pairing of the two smbhs is successful because the gas - rich merging satellite undergoes a strong central star formation burst , developing a higher central density allowing its survival to tidal disruption down to the center of the primary .",
    "@xcite , who studied the pairing of smbhs in the merger of late type gas rich galaxies in simulations which include star formation and accretion onto the smbh , found that the mass ratio of the two smbhs can change significantly due to the fact that the secondary is fed at a higher rate as a result of the stronger gas inflow caused by the tidal disturbance .",
    "the latter simulations of minor mergers could not follow the decay of the two smbhs to separations of less than tens of parsec .",
    "hence it is unknown whether or not they would reach the critical separation for gravitational wave emission and on which timescales . continuing the calculations further with gas dynamics is computationally challenging .",
    "in addition , at the end of the merger significant star formation takes place , increasing the contribution of the stars to the potential relative to the gas .",
    "therefore it is sensible to consider the approximation in which the stars are the dominant source of the drag acting onto the smbhs during the last stage of the sinking before gravitational waves take over .",
    "this is what we attempt to do for the first time in this paper , starting from a realistic late configuration of a gas - rich minor merger performed by @xcite , we followed the evolution of the smbh binary to the milli parsec ( mpc ) regime where gws start becoming important .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section  2 we describe the initial conditions for our direct @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the numerical methods and codes used for our simulations are described in section  3 . in section  4",

    "owing to numerical limitations in simulations of galaxy mergers in respect of accuracy on parsec or sub - parsec scale , e.g. , due to approximations in the force calculation ( gravitational softening , tree - approximation ) or insufficient integration schemes we follow a multi - step strategy to study the evolution of binary smbhs .",
    "we take simulation data from a galaxy merger simulation including smbhs in its final phase , i.e. , before reaching resolution limits and then follow up these simulations in high - resolution using direct @xmath0-body calculations with the dynamically relevant though spatially truncated region of the original galaxy merger .",
    "@xcite studied the pairing of binary smbhs in several 1:10 mergers of two disk galaxies using @xmath0-body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations conducted with the gasoline code @xcite .",
    "the reference galaxy model in that study was a milky way type disk galaxy consisting of three components : ( i ) a spherical and isotropic navarro , frenk & white profile dark matter halo , ( ii ) an exponential disk consisting of stars and gas and ( iii ) a spherical hernquist bulge .",
    "the mergers considered different orbital configurations . in all cases , except for a peculiar retrograde merger case , the two smbhs paired at the center of the remnant in less than 1 gyr from the end of the galaxy collision . in this paper",
    "we employ one particular merger set - up as initial conditions since already a single simulation of this kind requires several months of computation .",
    "in particular we choose the coplanar pro - grade merger simulation with 30% gas fraction in the disk since it resulted in the shortest merging time for the galaxies .",
    "the gravitational softening adopted in the study of @xcite was @xmath7 pc for dark matter and baryonic particles in the larger galaxy , whereas for smaller galaxy it was 20 pc .",
    "the smbh was introduced at the center of each galaxy represented by a point mass particle .",
    "the adopted masses for the smbhs were @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the primary and satellite galaxy respectively , consistent with the @xmath10-@xmath11 relation @xcite .",
    "the simulation also includes the effects of star formation and accretion on to the smbhs , as well as feedback from both processes .",
    "the final separation of the two smbhs at the end of the simulation was @xmath12 pc , which is comparable to the softening that was used in the simulations . for more details of the construction of the galaxy models and the set up for the initial orbit of the galaxy merger we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "here it suffices to say that the merger was assumed to start at @xmath13 , and is completed at a time corresponding to @xmath14 , a choice motivated by the optimal detection window of planned laser interferometers such as elisa .",
    "the choice of galaxy types and sizes , as well as of the masses of the smbhs just reported , is thus made based on the characteristic densities expected in the concordance @xmath15cdm model for galaxies having the same circular velocity as the milky way @xmath16 km s@xmath17 .    in this study",
    "we choose a snapshot of the system at the time 2.56 gyr of @xcite , when the separation between the two black holes is @xmath18  pc and the black holes are still embedded in the individual cusps ( figure  [ fig1zu ] ) .",

    "we select all particles in the central 5 kpc region of the merger remnant and added all those particles , which have pericenter passage smaller than 3 kpc .",
    "most of the gas in the central region is already converted into stars .",
    "the remaining gas particles , which contribute only a few percent in mass in the central region ( figure [ fig2zu ] ) are also treated as stars in our simulations .",
    "the total mass of the selected sample is @xmath22 .",
    "although state - of - the - art hydrodynamical simulations , the callegari et al . ( 2011 ) mergers use a few million particles to represent the stellar component of a galaxy , it is still several orders of magnitude smaller than the actual number of stars in a real galaxy . because of the small number of dark matter particles the mass of one particle in the primary galaxy is comparable to the mass of the smbh in the satellite galaxy in @xcite .",
    "this is a potential problem for continuing the calculation to higher resolution in a regime in which the interaction with the background of stars and dark matter might dominate , since it can lead to unrealistic mass segregation of the dark matter and non - physically large kicks of the two smbhs . to avoid such high mass particle encounters with the smbh binary , we split each dark matter particle in the primary galaxy into ten particles .",
    "each child particle has mass 1/10 of the parent particle .",
    "the child particles are randomly distributed over a 10 pc sphere corresponding to the softening of the parent dark matter particle used in our simulations ( see section 3.2 . ) .",
    "the child particles have the same velocities as their parent particles .",

    "in fact , we find for stellar density profile , @xmath59 const in our simulation . for steep cusps ( @xmath57 = 1.5 , 1.75 ) the smbh binary undergoes a rapid phase of evolution before entering the hard binary regime , presumably corresponding to the clearing of the loss cone @xcite .",

    "we describe in detail the different runs that we carried out in order to reach a smbh separation where gravitational wave emission starts becoming important . at @xmath60 myr , we reduce the particle number from @xmath61 million to @xmath62 million by selecting the particles which have their estimated pericenter in the inner 1 kpc to increase the computational speed ( run-2 ) . in order to see whether or not our selection has introduced some changes in the mass distribution , we plot the cumulative mass distribution at various time steps after the new selection of particles ( figure [ fig6 ] ) .",

    "we can see from the top panel of the figure [ fig7 ] that deviations from spherical symmetry extend all the way to the center ( few tens of parsec ) .",
    "the merger remnant is considerably flattened , which can also be seen from figure [ fig3 ] , when compared to those which result after the merger of two spherical galaxy progenitors .",
    "the flattening increases as we move to larger distances and becomes more or less constant about a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "we also calculate the axes ratio at different times of evolution for the merger remnant at a distance of 200 pc from the center , as most of the centrophilic orbits are expected to come at about this distance .",
    "as is seen from the bottom panel of figure [ fig7 ] , the axes ratios remain constant during the whole time of the evolution of the smbh binary . due to the non - spherical shape of the merger remnant",

    "the faint bulges / ellipticals which host smaller smbhs with masses @xmath87 m@xmath86 have typically steep cusps ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "it is conceivable that the prolonged effect of gas dissipation at higher mass and spatial resolution in the last stages of the merger , beyond the starting point of the direct @xmath0-body calculation , would have led to a steeper baryonic cusp at small scales ( see mayer et al .",
    "2007 on the dependence of the inner density profile of merger remnants on the numerical resolution of the gas component ) .",
    "in addition , the slope of the initial bulge profile in the galaxy models could be steeper and yet still consistent with the observed distribution of bulge slopes .",
    "hence , we can easily expect that typical coalescence times for smbh binaries in gas - rich mergers can be shorter and comparable to @xcite .",
    "starting from the results of @xcite , we studied the orbital evolution of a pair of smbhs in a minor merger of disk galaxies ( with 30% gas fraction in the disk ) , from an initial separation of 60 kpc to a final separation of less than a milli parsec ( binary s pericenter distance ) .",
    "initially the mass ratio between the galaxies and smbhs is 0.1 . during the merger the two smbhs accrete gas and",
    "increase their masses in the process .",
    "the mass of the smbh in the satellite galaxy increases almost 8 fold as the gas in the secondary galaxy is funneled towards the center due to the tidal force of the primary galaxy at each peri - center passage .",
    "the perturbations produced by the passages of the secondary galaxy are not significant for the primary galaxy , so the smbh in the primary galaxy accretes gas steadily and the mass of smbh here grows by a factor of @xmath89 . at the end of sph simulations ,",
    "the mass ratio between the two smbhs is approximately @xmath90 ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) .    at the start of our direct @xmath0-body simulations ,",
    "the separation between the two smbhs is roughly 700 pc , and the binary has yet to form .",
    "gas particles , which contribute only a few percent to the mass of the selected central region , are treated as star particles .",
    "we use particle splitting to reduce the mass of dark matter particles to avoid both mass segregation and unphysical encounters of high mass dark matter particles with the smbhs .",
    "dynamical friction is very efficient in bringing the two smbhs to a separation where they form a binary at a separation of roughly 15 pc .",
    "the subsequent hardening , which happens at a constant rate , is governed by individual stars interacting with the massive binary .",
    "we artificially suppress the contribution of dark matter to the hardening of the smbh binary by introducing a large softening ( @xmath91  pc ) .",
    "the shape analysis of the merger product shows that the system is predominantly triaxial from the periphery to the center .",
    "the smbh binary evolves at a constant rate and the hardening rate is high , which suggests that the stalling of the smbh binary should not be an issue in realistic galaxy mergers such as those considered here .",
    "the eccentricity is very high ( @xmath92 ) as was observed for the shallow density profile ( @xmath93 ) galaxy merger simulations performed in our earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the dependence on eccentricity of the coalescence time under gw emission is @xmath94 .",
    "for very eccentric smbh binaries this could easily account for a decrease of an order of magnitude",
    ". accordingly it will be very important to further investigate the dependence of the eccentricity evolution under different values of @xmath57 and @xmath95 .",
    "currently we are carrying out direct @xmath0-body simulations of galaxy mergers with galaxies having both steep and shallow density profiles at the centers together with an initial mass function to address this question .    with our current study",
    "we evolve the smbh binary to a separation ( 0.9 mpc at pericenter of the smbh binary ) , where the contribution to the hardening rate of the smbh binary due to the emission of gws becomes important ( roughly 10% ) . using the constant value of the hardening rate in the newtonian regime and the formula of @xcite for gws emission from two point masses orbiting each other , in the relativistic regime",
    ", we estimate the coalescence time of two smbhs to be 2.9 gyr after the merger of the two galaxies .",
    "the coalescence time of 2.9 gyr , although longer when compared to the times obtained for similar mass binaries in @xcite , is still short enough to have a few 1:10 mergers of smbhs in late type galaxy mergers in the range at which elisa is most sensitive . from @xcite , we know that binary hardening rates depend strongly on the adopted density profile . for steep density cusps observed at the center of faint bulges / ellipticals , we can expect the coalescence times to be much shorter , comparable to the ones that were obtained in @xcite for the merger of steep power law density profile galaxies .",
    "the current work should be regarded mainly as proof - of - concept , since we have considered only one particular initial condition and have not computed directly the binary smbh shrinking in the post - newtonian phase .",
    "nevertheless , it shows for the first time that the coalescence of the two smbhs on a timescale sufficiently short to be astrophysically relevant does indeed take place as a result of a quite realistic galaxy merger with previous effects of dissipation taken into account . in the future",
    "we will explore a wider range of initial conditions motivated by cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and we will carry out the direct computation of the binary shrinking to much smaller separations .",
