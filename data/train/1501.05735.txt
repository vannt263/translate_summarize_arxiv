    "the lattice parameters at @xmath75 k were determined from the neutron diffraction experiment @xcite , values are shown in table [ tab : str ] , which are consistent with previous reports @xcite .",

    "the crystal structure consists of chains aligned along the @xmath6-axis , formed by alternating face - sharing nio@xmath1 trigonal prisms and iro@xmath1 octahedra .",
    "the chains are arranged on a triangular lattice in the @xmath7-plane .",
    "there are two ir ions in the primitive unit at ( 0,0,0 ) and ( 0,0,1/2 ) , and two ni atom at ( 0,0,1/4 ) and ( 0,0,3/4 ) .",
    "taking into account the rhombohedral - lattice translations @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and identity , there are six ir and six ni sites in the conventional hexagonal unit - cell .",
    "the aforementioned symmetry leads to a shift of @xmath78 between neighboring magnetic atoms along the chains .",
    "figure [ fig : chi ] shows the magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath79 ) of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1as a function of temperature in zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) conditions measured in an applied magnetic field of 0.1 t. although both the zfc and fc susceptibilities arise sharply below @xmath80 k , these exhibit considerably different behavior below @xmath81 k. while the zfc signal sharply drops below 20 k , the fc susceptibility is almost constant below 20 k. similar behavior was previously reported @xcite and also observed in single crystals of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  in external field parallel to the @xmath6-axis @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spin - chain compound sr@xmath0nirho@xmath1 ( @xmath25 k ) also exhibits very similar behavior in the zfc and fc susceptibility @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the susceptibilities of sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 ( @xmath26 k ) @xcite@xcite and sr@xmath0znrho@xmath1 ( @xmath82 k ) @xcite do not show any difference between zfc and fc susceptibility below @xmath5 . it is a general trend for the spin - chain systems of this family having two different magnetic atoms alternating along the chain to exhibit considerable different behavior in the temperature dependent susceptibility for zfc and fc . the inverse susceptibility of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1exhibits a curie - weiss ( cw ) behavior between 200 and 300 k with an effective total moment of @xmath83 per formula - unit and paramagnetic cw temperature of @xmath84 k for zfc data ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ) .",
    "however these values should be taken as rough estimates , due to the different temperature dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibility of ir and ni ions .",
    "the negative sign of the cw temperature indicates dominant antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "furthermore , @xmath79 exhibits a broad maximum below 100 k , indicating the low - dimensional nature ( or due to frustration ) of the magnetic interactions in sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 .",
    "the measured ac - susceptibility has a peak in the real part ( @xmath85 ) at 20 k @xcite , which shows strong frequency dependence ( i.e. peak position increases with frequency ) and the time dependent magnetization follows logarithmic decay at 20 k. these results show the importance of magnetic frustration due to the triangular nature of the crystal structure .",
    "we have also measured the heat capacity of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  between 2 k and 300 k ( see figure [ fig : heat ] ) and havent found any clear signature of magnetic phase transition down to 2 k , even though the neutron diffraction study clearly reveals the present of magnetic bragg peaks below 70 k @xcite , confirming afm magnetic order below 70 k. on the other hand , the neutron diffraction data did not show any clear change in the magnetic structure between 2 k and 70 k. it should be noted that the heat capacity of sr@xmath0nirho@xmath1 @xcite , did not reveal any magnetic phase transition either , but those of sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 @xcite and sr@xmath0znrho@xmath1 @xcite exhibit a clear @xmath86-type anomaly at the magnetic ordering temperature . this might indicate that the absence of the @xmath86-type anomaly in sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  is strongly related to the low - dimensional nature in magnetic structure .",
    "the observed value of the heat capacity for sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1  at 300 k is 254 j@xmath87mol@xmath21k@xmath21 , which is in a good agreement with that expected from the lattice contribution based on dulong and petit law @xcite ( for n - atom molecules @xmath88 j@xmath87mol@xmath21k@xmath21 ) , showing that magnetic correlations are completely lost at room temperature .",
    "we propose a simple magnetic hamiltonian , where we take into account only interactions between nearest neighbor magnetic atoms along the @xmath6-axis and single ion anisotropy of the ni@xmath8 ions .",
    "this model gives a perfect fit to the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) powder data , this also justifies that the interchain interactions can be neglected .",
    "due to the rhombohedral - translations every ni - ir chain are equivalent to a single chain with two atoms .",
    "we denote the ir and ni atoms with sublattice @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively .",
    "we restrict our spin hamiltonian using the crystallographic space group .",
    "the point group symmetry @xmath91 of the ni atom allows only a single anisotropy parameter along the c - axis denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "the allowed matrix elements of the ni - ir bond is determined by the point group symmetry of the center of the bond that is @xmath92 .",
    "this allows anisotropic exchange , with different @xmath34 and @xmath35 values , also dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction is allowed parallel to the @xmath6-axis that we neglect here . with the above assumptions we propose the following effective spin hamiltonian : @xmath93    the first two sums describe the anisotropic exchange interaction on both the ni and ir sites , while the last term describes the single - ion anisotropy of the ni sites . in the observed magnetic structure",
    "the spins point along the @xmath68-axis af order along the chain .",
    "the classical ground state of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] is identical to this if @xmath34 is positive and @xmath94 for zero anisotropy .",
    "assuming the af ground state , we calculated the spin wave dispersion using the holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite to reduce the hamiltonian to non - interacting bosons ( magnons ) and applied the bogoliubov transformation to diagonalize the quadratic form @xcite . since there are two sublattices , we obtained two @xmath95 spin wave modes dispersing along the chain direction :      where @xmath29 is the momentum of the magnon in @xmath21 units , @xmath6 is the lattice parameter . in order to fit the measured spectrum , we calculated the bottom and top energies of the spin wave band ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) . if @xmath99 we got : @xmath100 while if @xmath101 we got : @xmath102    if we determine the bottom and the top of the spin wave band from the ins data , there is only a single free parameter @xmath36 to be fitted . by calculating the powder spin wave spectrum by averaging out sufficiently enough random sample orientations for a series of @xmath36 values , we could determine @xmath36 by a direct comparison of the simulation and data .",
    "an alternative fitting of the data is possible if we assume that we only observe the lower spin wave band .",
    "thus there is an upper branch that we missed either due to its small ins cross section within our measured momentum transfer and energy range or it was above our maximum measured incident neutron energy ( @xmath103 mev ) .",
    "detection of spin waves at high energies is much harder due to the cutoff of the ins intensity at higher @xmath29 values because of the magnetic form factor .",
    "we simulated this scenario within our spin wave model .",
    "the highest possible energy of the upper band is 75 mev assuming negative @xmath36 , this belongs to @xmath104 mev , @xmath105 mev and @xmath106 mev . in this case",
    "the gap is induced only by the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "however in this case the lower band in the q - integrated cuts would be symmetric as a function of energy , which is not consistent with the data , where the inelastic peak shows a shoulder higher energies .",
    "in addition , the q - dependence of the lower magnon band would show the ni form factor mainly , which does nt fit the data either , where the upper shoulder has clearly different q - dependence than the peak intensity at 35 mev , see fig .",
    "4(c - d ) in the manuscript .",
    "thus we can exclude that there is an upper undetected spin wave branch with great confidence .",

    "<S> one of these , ( quasi- ) one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin chain is important for understanding low - dimensional magnetism @xcite and useful for advancing quantum communications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the study of quantum spin chains has a long history , going back at least to the remarkable exact solution found by bethe in 1931 for the spin-1/2 case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spin wave theory , developed by anderson @xcite , kubo @xcite and others in the 1950s @xcite , has given a clear physical picture of the behavior of three - dimensional ( 3d ) antiferromagnets ( afm ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , 1d case remained rather mysterious as compared to the higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> regarding 1d case , haldane first suggested that integer - spin afm heisenberg spin chains have a finite gap , and only the half - odd - integer chains are gapless @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> significant effort has been devoted over the past several decades to understand the behavior of frustrated quasi-1d spin systems @xcite , which exhibit a rich variety of phases due to the enhanced quantum fluctuations in reduced dimensionality . </S>",

    "<S> the magnetic origin of the strong scattering in the 29.5 - 39 mev band is established by the initial reduction in the energy - integrated inelastic intensity as a function of @xmath20 ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) up to 4 @xmath21 caused by spin - wave excitation , and then an increase with @xmath20 due to phonon scattering . </S>",

    "<S> the presence of a giant spin gap and large zone - boundary energy in sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 , can be explained only if there exists strong anisotropic magnetic exchange interaction and/or single - ion anisotropy owing to soc . </S>",
    "<S> this is further supported by the small spin gap observed in sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 in which the soc would have similar strength compared to that in sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the intra - chain and inter - chain ir - ir distances are very similar ( @xmath27  ) in sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 , which is much larger than the nearest - neighboring ni - ir distance ( @xmath28  ) in sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> hence it is expected that the intra - chain interaction is comparable to the inter - chain interaction in sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 , while the intra - chain coupling is dominant in sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this could result in the disappearance of 1d magnetism in sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 .    to see the development of the inelastic magnetic scattering ( at low - q , 0 to 3.5 @xmath21 ) and the phonon excitations ( appear at high - q , 8 to 10 @xmath21 ) , we have extracted q - integrated energy cuts from the ins data as shown in fig .  [ fig : cuts](a - d ) . at low - q , between 5 and 100 k </S>",
    "<S> , we can see a strong inelastic peak near 30 mev with a shoulder near 35 mev ( second peak ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cuts](a - b ) , which remains nearly temperature - independent up to 100 k. in high - q cuts ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cuts](c - d ) ) the absence of this 30 - 35 mev peak indicates that it is due to magnetic excitations and its intensity decreases with @xmath29 as expected from the magnetic form factor of ni@xmath8 and ir@xmath23 ions ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at high - q , a strong peak near 15 mev ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cuts](c - d ) ) is due to phonon excitations as its intensity is very weak at low - q . </S>",
    "<S> between 150 k and 300 k , at low - q , the intensity at 30 - 35 mev peak decreases and almost disappears at 300 k , but that of 15 mev peak increases . to see magnetic excitations clearly , we have subtracted phonon scattering from the 5 k data using the data of 300 k. the magnetic scattering at 5 k thus derived in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) reveals a clear magnetic excitation between 30 and 39 mev . to check the q - dependent intensity of these excitations </S>",

    "<S> these cuts show a double - peak structure with a stronger peak around 33 mev and a weaker one around 37 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed magnetic inelastic scattering can be well described using linear spin wave theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the double - peak structure can be approximately attributed to spin waves on the ir and ni sites . </S>",
    "<S> the stronger lower - energy peak corresponds to spin waves on the ni@xmath8 ions since the spin wave intensity is proportional to the spin quantum number . </S>",
    "<S> besides , if the large spin gap is attributed to exchange anisotropy , the upper peak has to be ir spin waves , due to the larger weiss molecular field at the ir sites created by the larger spin of the ni@xmath8 ions .    the published neutron diffraction data of sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1can be equally well fitted with two different solutions @xcite both with ordering wave vector @xmath33 . in the first structure , </S>",

    "<S> we assume fully ordered chains of spin-1 and spin-1/2 ions and neglect inter - chain coupling . owing to the soc </S>",
    "<S> , we expect strongly anisotropic exchange interaction along the chain and a single - ion anisotropy for the spin-1 ni site . due to the threefold axis along the ni - ir chains ( see fig.1 ) , the most general exchange matrix has two different diagonal elements , @xmath34 and @xmath35 and the single - ion anisotropy can have only a @xmath36 component on the ni - site . </S>",
    "<S> the observed magnetic structure suggests that @xmath34 is afm and larger than @xmath35 . </S>",

    "<S> the calculated intensity includes the square of the g - factor of ni@xmath8 ( @xmath13 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) and ir@xmath23 ( @xmath11 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) ions and the magnetic form factor calculated from tabulated values and the g - factor . </S>",
    "<S> the fit shows an excellent agreement with the data and also the q - dependence is very well reproduced ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fit](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the only significant difference is the @xmath29 dependent intensity of the upper ir mode , where the measured intensity decreases slower as given by our magnetic form factor . </S>",
    "<S> this suggest that the ir@xmath23 orbitals are significantly contracted in comparison to the free ir@xmath23 ion . </S>",
    "<S> ab - initio calculations would be necessary to precisely determine the magnetic form factor , however , this is beyond the scope of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated spin wave cross section agrees very well with the measured data in absolute units assuming fully ordered chains . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can also exclude the partially ordered chain structure as a possible ground state , since it would reduce the spin wave cross section by 1/3 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated sr@xmath0niiro@xmath1using inelastic neutron scattering , along with a spin - wave analysis . </S>",
    "<S> our ins study reveals spin wave excitations with with a giant energy gap of 30 mev at 5 k. more strikingly , these gapped excitations survive up to a high temperature of 200 k , well above @xmath5 , thus confirming the quasi-1d nature of the magnetic interaction . our spin wave analysis has given an excellent description of the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of giant spin gap , as compared to the very small spin gap in sr@xmath0zniro@xmath1 having only @xmath15 magnetic ion ( below 1.5 mev with zb of 5 mev ) reveals that mixed @xmath14-@xmath15 ( or @xmath14-@xmath50 ) compounds can generate distinct exchange pathways and thus novel magnetic behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the present study can foster the research on the magnetic excitations in spin - chain systems to consider such hitherto unrealized factors , and would generate theoretical interest of the development of a more realistic model to understand the complex magnetic behavior of these systems .    </S>",
