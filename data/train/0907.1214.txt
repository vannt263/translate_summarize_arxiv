    "there is strong interest in using two - photon physics to search for signs of new physics @xcite .    because the coupling constant @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the electromagnetic coupling constant ) is large , two - photon interactions may be accompanied by additional electromagnetic interactions , such as additional two - photon reactions , or photonuclear interactions .",
    "photonuclear reactions can produce collective nuclear excitations , e.g. a giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) , or can involve more energetic processes , such as pion production .",
    "multiple additional reactions also occur .",
    "for example , one photon from each nucleus can dissociate the other , in mutual coulomb dissociation ( mcd ) @xcite .",
    "experimentally , neutrons from the nuclear dissociation are detected in zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) downstream from the collision points , in both directions .",
    "these neutrons make a convenient trigger , separating two - photon and other ultra - peripheral collisions ( upcs ) from backgrounds such as cosmic rays and beam - gas interactions .",
    "the neutrons also tag events with a smaller mean impact parameter than exclusive two - photon events .",

    "calculations of @xmath8 pair production accompanied by mcd are challenging , because the typical impact parameters are smaller than the electron compton wavelength , @xmath11 fm @xcite .",
    "the cross - section measured by star is larger than lowest - order qed calculation ; the difference can be explained by higher order corrections @xcite .    here",
    ", we calculate the cross sections , rapidity , invariant mass , and transverse momentum distributions for two - photon production of a selection of scalar and tensor mesons and @xmath12 and @xmath13 pairs .",
    "we calculate the cross - sections and distributions with and without nuclear breakup , and explore how nuclear breakup affects the reactions .    because the cross - section for n - photon interactions scales as @xmath14 we focus on heavy nuclei : gold - gold collisions at a center of mass energy of @xmath15 gev per nucleon ( beam lorentz boost @xmath16 ) , as seen at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , and lead - lead collisions at an energy of 5.5 tev per nucleon , as will be produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , where @xmath17 .",

    "section ii will present a calculation of the two - photon luminosity .",
    "section iii discusses the effects of multiple interactions , while section iv finds the two - photon luminosity under various different nuclear breakup conditions and discuss the uncertainties in the calculation .",
    "the final state @xmath4 spectra are discussed in section v , and section vi gives some conclusions .",
    "according to the method of equivalent photons , the cross section for a two - photon reaction , fig . 1a , factorizes into an elementary cross section for @xmath24 and a @xmath1 luminosity @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the cross section to produce a final state with mass @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the two photon energies , and @xmath30 is the photon flux at energy @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath1 luminosity is given by convolution of the equivalent photon spectra from the two nuclei .",
    "in impact parameter space , the total number of photons from one nucleus is obtained by integrating over all impact parameters larger than some minimum , typically given by the nuclear radius . this is similar to integrating over all possible momentum transfers , @xmath32 , from some minimum determined by the kinematics up to a maximum given by the nuclear form factor . in hadronic collisions",
    ", the impact parameter representation provides the best way to incorporate effects of strong absorption .",
    "hadronic interactions will dominate in collisions where both hadronic and electromagnetic interactions are possible .",
    "the hadronic interaction must therefore be excluded to obtain the effective or usable cross section for two - photon interactions . in impact parameter space , this can be accomplished by requiring that the impact parameter be larger than the sum of the nuclear radii .",
    "the equivalent two - photon luminosity is thus @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ion - ion luminosity , @xmath35 is the flux of photons with energy @xmath31 at impact parameter @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the woods - saxon nuclear radius .    the requirements @xmath38 and",
    "@xmath39 ensure that the final state is produced outside the nuclei .",
    "otherwise , the final state will usually interact with the nucleus , destroying itself and breaking up the nucleus .",
    "this requirement may not be strictly necessary for some final states , such as lepton pairs .",
    "alternately , a smaller radius might be appropriate .",
    "however , since the electric fields drop rapidly for @xmath40 , this is a relatively small correction .",

    "the nuclear thickness function is the integral of the nuclear density , @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the impact parameter from the center of the nucleus . the nuclear density profile @xmath59 of heavy nuclei is well described with a woods - saxon distribution .",

    "although this approach speeds the calculation , it works poorly for the realistic models of nuclear density or when additional photon exchange is included .",
    "cahn and jackson used a related approach , calculating the luminosity analytically without the requirement @xmath52 , and then numerically calculating a correction for the overlap @xcite .",
    "this approach also can not accomodate nuclear breakup .    in principle , the meson or lepton pair production cross section depends on the angle between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , with different cross sections for parallel and perpendicular photon polarizations @xcite .",
    "however , after integration over @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the differences are small , and we neglect them .    the cross section to produce a narrow resonance with spin @xmath64 and mass @xmath65 is @xmath66 where we neglect the width of the hadronic resonances .",
    "the magnitude of the error due to this narrow - resonance approximation scales linearly with the width . for coherent photonuclear @xmath67 production , including the width reduces the cross section by about 5% @xcite .",
    "a similar correction is expected for two - photon production ; these adjustments should should scale linearly with the relative width ( @xmath68 ) of the resonance .",

    "photons with energies from 8 - 24 mev can excite a gdr resonance in heavy nuclei . to observe the @xmath76 breakup ,",

    "the exception is @xmath96 production at rhic , where the current cross - section is 6 times higher .",
    "the difference may lie in how the papers handle the non - collision requirement ; bertulani and navarra apply a form factor to the nuclei instead of applying an explicit requirement that @xmath97 ; this can lead to substantially different results near the kinematic limit .",
    "these rates are also very similar to the @xmath96 results reported in ref .",
    "our rates are 10 - 25% higher than those in a very similar calculation @xcite ; the difference stems from slightly different @xmath37 ( ref .",

    "one of us has also performed born calculations by numerical integration @xcite , and found results consistent with hencken , kuraev and serbo when adjusted for the slightly lower energies of the numerical calculations ( @xmath100 of 100 and 2760 ) .",
    "these born calculations have no cutoff in integration over @xmath101 and @xmath102 ; point charges are assumed for the ions and a correction is made by applying a form factor for the virtual photons emanating from each ion .",
    "notable differences between the various calculations are in the treatment of the possibility of accompanying hadronic interactions and in how the virtual photons are cut off , either by integration over @xmath101 and @xmath102 or by a form factor . here",

    "a similar limitation holds for @xmath1 interactions with protons , where the choice of proton form factor or radius can substantially affect the photon flux @xcite .",

    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross - sections in table i are new .",
    "they are about 1/10 and 1/100 of the untagged cross sections , respectively , at rhic ; at the lhc the reduction is a bit larger . these are small fractions , but @xmath2 reactions may still be of value because of the triggering advantages that they provide .",

    "although these rates are high , it should be noted that the cross section for coherent vector meson production with similar event topology are about two order of magnitudes larger for mesons of similar mass @xcite . a way to separate the two reactions may be through the different @xmath4-spectra , as will be discussed in the next section .",
