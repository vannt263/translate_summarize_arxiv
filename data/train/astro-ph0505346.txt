    "a new generation of neutrino telescopes is now opening an exciting new window on the high energy universe . indeed , planned or already built",
    "large neutrino detectors are capable of providing us with potentially revolutionary observations in the fields of particle physics , cosmology , astronomy and astrophysics .    among different detection techniques proposed or already used , a particularly important role is played by under - ice and under - water optical erenkov detectors .",
    "this technique was very successfully implemented in the amanda detector @xcite at the south pole and in the lake baikal experiment @xcite .",
    "the much larger , km@xmath1-size detector icecube @xcite is currently under construction on the antarctic ice , while other detectors ( antares , nemo and nestor ) are also being built in the mediterranean sea . while these under - ice / water optical erenkov detectors are sensitive at roughly tev - pev neutrino energies , which is essentially the range of interest in this work , other experiments extend the range of sensitivity up to ultra - high neutrino energies .",
    "indeed , the radio erenkov detectors ( such as rice , anita , glue and salsa ) are sensitive roughly in the pev - eev energy range , while detectors making use of the earth s atmosphere as a target volume ( e.g. fly s eye , agasa , hires and auger ) are sensitive at roughly eev - zev energies .    being able to escape even from very dense astrophysical environments , and to travel vast distances undeflected and unattenuated , neutrinos are a precious probe to the high energy universe , which is complementary to both gamma rays and cosmic rays",
    ". pioneer work on high energy neutrinos produced in various astrophysical processes was accomplished roughly three decades ago ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . nowadays , a primary motivation for studying neutrinos above tev energies is the identification of possible individual , point - like extragalactic sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and gamma ray bursters ( grbs ) .",
    "it has also been proposed recently that jets accompanying core - collapse supernovae would produce detectable high energy neutrino bursts @xcite , which would reveal a connection between core - collapse supernovae and long duration grbs .",
    "furthermore , the existence of different kinds of neutrino sources located within the galaxy has been suggested and studied ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the identification of point sources might be difficult to achieve , since they might be too weak to produce unambiguous directional signals in the detectors",
    ". hence , also the detection of the corresponding unresolved diffuse fluxes ( i.e. the integrated fluxes produced by all sources ) remains an important task . in order to achieve this goal ,",
    "a sound knowledge of all other possible diffuse neutrino signals is obviously crucial .    at low energies",
    ", it is well known that _",
    "conventional _ neutrinos produced by the decays of pions and kaons due to cosmic ray ( cr ) interactions in the atmosphere give the dominating signal @xcite ( and this is , in fact , the only type of signal identified so far ) . at energies above few hundreds of gev , however , this component becomes strongly attenuated due to the fact that the parent mesons live longer and interact before decaying .",
    "the picture then looks more confusing , since different high energy neutrino fluxes of diverse origin , but possibly similar intensity , are expected to show up @xcite .    besides the extragalactic fluxes mentioned above , other expected diffuse components of comparable ( or even larger ) intensity are , for instance , the so - called _ prompt _ fluxes arising from the decay of short - lived charmed particles produced by cr interactions in the atmosphere ( see e.g. refs .",
    "the evaluation of this prompt component requires taking into account next - to - leading - order processes in the charm production cross section , which is also dependent on the behavior of the parton distribution functions at very low values ( @xmath2 ) of the fraction of momentum carried by the partons , well below the range measured in present accelerators .",
    "the large uncertainties coming from the small-@xmath3 extrapolation procedures are propagated on the estimated prompt neutrino fluxes and span more than an order of magnitude .",
    "a characteristic signature of this ( roughly isotropic ) signal is the flavor ratio @xmath4 , clearly different from the ratio 1:1:1 expected in a standard scenario for any extraterrestrial signal , due to the effects of neutrino flavor oscillations during propagation @xcite .",
    "another contribution to the high energy diffuse neutrino fluxes is that resulting from the interactions of the crs present all over the galaxy with the ambient gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "the very low densities in the ism ( @xmath5 ) imply that essentially all mesons produced decay in this case without suffering any attenuation , and hence the neutrino fluxes are just the conventional ones from @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays . since these neutrino fluxes depend on the column density of the ism along the particular direction considered , this component shows a significant anisotropy , being maximal in the direction to the galactic center ( gc ) ( and generally enhanced near the galactic plane ) , while being minimal in the direction orthogonal to it .",
    "although it was recognized that these diffuse fluxes of galactic neutrinos could compete with the other expected contributions at high energies , a careful investigation of this signal was missing in the literature .",
    "indeed , inhomogeneities in the cr density at different locations in the galaxy were disregarded in previous investigations @xcite , in which variations in the ism density were generally neglected as well . on the contrary , in this work",
    "it is shown that large cr density inhomogeneities arise due to both large - scale drift effects and the inhomogeneous distribution of cr sources , producing an order - of - magnitude enhancement of the cr density in the gc region , where the ism density is also maximal .",
    "hence , this effect enhances the fluxes expected from the gc region for the diffuse signal of neutrinos produced in the milky way .",
    "a detailed study of this contribution is important on its own , since its detection would imply the discovery of a new high energy neutrino signal , which would be also a new probe of cosmic rays and the interstellar medium .",
    "but , furthermore , it is also crucially important as a background in order to identify a real extragalactic flux , and hence a new probe of the high energy universe .",
    "as already pointed out , measurements of the anisotropy in galactic coordinates could be used to distinguish between these different possibilities .    in the next section",
    ", we focus on the diffusion / drift scenario that describes the transport of crs in the galaxy under turbulent conditions @xcite .",
    "while obtaining a sound agreement with local cr observations , we show that large inhomogeneities in the galactic cr density do arise as well . in section 3",
    ", we calculate the relevant neutrino fluxes and corresponding event rates , showing that the enhanced galactic flux produced in the gc direction would dominate at high energies above @xmath0  gev . despite the small event rates , the detection of the diffuse galactic signal in a km@xmath1-size telescope such as icecube is shown to be feasible and realistic .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "according to the standard picture , galactic crs are accelerated in supernova remnants , the expanding shock wave fronts produced by the explosion of supernovae .",
    "this mechanism is suitable for producing high energy cr fluxes with power - law spectra .",
    "the different nuclear components generated in this way may have upper cutoffs at the energies @xmath9 , where @xmath10 would correspond to the cutoff of the proton component . in the context of the supernova paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays",
    ", this upper cutoff may range between @xmath11 and @xmath12  ev , depending on whether the strong shocks develop in the ism or in the stellar wind of the predecessor star @xcite .",
    "higher cutoffs can be achieved , for instance , in a cooperative acceleration scenario , in which the collective effect of multiple stellar winds gives rise to an additional acceleration process @xcite . for the sake of simplicity , here we assume a featureless production of galactic crs ( ignoring cutoffs ) and study how the spectrum is shaped by the cr turbulent transport .",
    "anyhow , the neutrino fluxes at energies above the pev are too faint to be detectable ( see the expected event rates in fig.5 ) , and hence the high energy end of the galactic cr spectrum should not be relevant for the present discussion .    in order to characterize the transport of cosmic rays in the galaxy , we will present here a simplified analytical realization of the diffusion / drift scenario @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the previous investigations on this scenario were concerned only with the * local * observations of crs , proposing suitable explanations of the cr spectrum and the observed knees , as well as of the composition and anisotropy measurements .",
    "here we focus our attention instead on the * global * inhomogeneities of the cr population in the galaxy arising from the inhomogeneous distribution of sources and from the onset of macroscopic large - scale drifts .",
    "indeed , the main goal of this work is to show the relevant role played by these global inhomogeneities in the production of detectable neutrino fluxes from the gc region . in order to check the consistency and suitability of the approach used here",
    ", the model results for the local cr spectrum are required to agree with the corresponding experimental observations .",
    "the region of propagation of the cr particles , the galaxy , is often assumed for simplicity as a cylinder of radius @xmath13 and height @xmath14 . for definiteness , here we will consider a flat model of the galaxy with @xmath15  kpc and @xmath16  kpc .",
    "the galactic disk , which contains most of the visible matter , has a height of a few hundred pc and is embedded in a much larger structure , the galactic halo , which is thought to contain large amounts of dark matter .",
    "associated to both the disk and the halo there are large - scale regular magnetic fields of a typical intensity of a few @xmath8 g , which are oriented to a good approximation in the azimuthal direction . in the following ,",
    "a single extended regular magnetic field @xmath17 will be considered , without making any further distinction between disk and halo components .",
    "the properties of this extended regular magnetic field are not well known , although observations seem to favor an antisymmetric structure ( i.e. a field with opposite directions below and above the galactic plane ) , as would correspond to an a0 dynamo field configuration @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention , however , that here we are adopting a simplified picture of the regular magnetic field . indeed , while zeeman splitting @xcite and polarization observations at sub - millimeter wavelengths @xcite revealed very strong toroidal magnetic fields in the central molecular zone , other observations also indicated the presence of nonthermal radio filaments @xcite and threads @xcite in the galactic center region , which appear to be directed nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "hence , the azimuthal symmetry assumed here should be regarded as a simplifying assumption that captures the global characteristics of the regular magnetic field in the galaxy .",
    "the macroscopic drifts , anyhow , being large scale currents that dominate the diffusion of cosmic rays at high energies , are not expected to be much dependent on the details of the magnetic field configurations .",
    "superimposed to the regular magnetic field , a random component associated to the turbulent interstellar plasma is known to exist , with a maximum scale of turbulence of order @xmath18  pc . since this random field component has a strength comparable to the field of the regular component , namely of the order of a @xmath8 g , the transport of cosmic rays in the galaxy takes place under highly turbulent conditions .",
    "existing observational data @xcite show that the spectrum of inhomogeneities may be the same for the density of the gas and for the magnetic field , and that it is close to a kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "hence , the random magnetic field can be assumed to be given by a power law spectrum with fourier components giving rise to a magnetic energy density d@xmath19 , for @xmath20 .",
    "a relativistic particle of charge @xmath21 propagating across a regular field @xmath17 describes a helical trajectory of radius @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the larmor radius given by @xmath24 while the pitch angle @xmath25 is the angle between the regular field and the particle velocity . in the presence of a superimposed random field component ,",
    "the crs scatter off the magnetic field irregularities with associated scales of order @xmath23 , changing their pitch angle but not their velocity .",
    "this collision mechanism , known as pitch angle scattering , provides an effective means of isotropization of the particle trajectories as long as the condition @xmath26 is met , which for instance corresponds to energies up to few @xmath27  gev for protons propagating in the galactic magnetic fields .",
    "another process known to contribute significantly to the diffusive transport of cosmic rays is the so - called field line random walk , which is the braiding and mixing of the magnetic field lines themselves @xcite .    neglecting nuclear fragmentation and energy - loss processes such as ionization losses and adiabatic deceleration ,",
    "the transport of high energy galactic cosmic rays is governed by diffusion .",
    "it should be remarked that adiabatic losses arising from convection in an expanding flow is an important mechanism in other contexts , e.g. in the escape of particles from expanding supernova remnants .",
    "however , in the absence of strong galactic winds , this term can be safely neglected in the transport equations describing high energy crs confined in the galaxy .",
    "thus , cr propagation takes place according to a diffusion equation , @xmath28 where @xmath29 describes the distribution of sources , @xmath30 is the cr differential flux and @xmath31 the cr macroscopic current .",
    "the diffusion tensor is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 indicates the direction of the regular field , @xmath34 is the kronecker delta and @xmath35 the fully antisymmetric levi - civita tensor .",
    "the diagonal components of the diffusion tensor are @xmath36 ( that corresponds to the diffusion in the direction parallel to the regular magnetic field ) and @xmath37 ( associated to the diffusion along the transverse directions ) , which depend on short scale turbulent fluctuations , while @xmath38 is the antisymmetric ( hall ) diffusion coefficient related to macroscopic drift effects .    detailed numerical investigations on the behavior of the different diffusion coefficients under highly turbulent conditions",
    "were recently performed @xcite .",
    "although the diffusion orthogonal to the regular magnetic field direction is typically much slower than the parallel one ( unless the turbulence level is very high , since parallel and perpendicular motions then become similar ) , both @xmath36 and @xmath37 have the same dependence on energy ( as long as @xmath39 , which is the case of interest for this work ) .",
    "indeed , it is found that @xmath40 , where @xmath41 characterizes the spectrum of the random magnetic field energy density , given by d@xmath42 @xcite . in particular , @xmath43 for the kolmogorov case . instead , the antisymmetric diffusion coefficient has a linear dependence on energy , @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "as we will discuss further below , this stronger energy dependence of @xmath38 plays a crucial role in the transport of high energy galactic crs , since the knee ( @xmath45  gev ) and the second knee ( @xmath46  gev ) of the spectrum can be explained as due to an enhancement in the escape of crs while going from the transverse diffusion dominated regime ( at low energies ) to the hall diffusion ( drift ) dominated regime ( at high energies ) .    besides the turbulent diffusion / drift scenario",
    ", many other models have been proposed in order to explain the cr observations around and beyond the knee region .",
    "for instance , it was recently proposed that most crs at energies above @xmath47  tev could be originated in grbs and that the knee feature could result from the transport of crs produced by a recent nearby galactic grb @xcite .",
    "many other models for the origin of the knee are reviewed and compared in ref .",
    "anyhow , the diffusion / drift scenario is among the favored models to explain the observations of galactic crs @xcite . it is based on very natural assumptions",
    ", it reproduces well the spectral shape and the composition observations , while it additionally predicts an anisotropy increase correlated with the knee of the spectrum @xcite , which is a particular feature that allows to single out this scenario from all other proposals .",
    "further evidence to clarify the origin of the cr knees will be available from mass group spectral observations and from more accurate measurements of the composition and the anisotropies , as expected for instance in the kascade - grande experiment @xcite .",
    "since we are here assuming the cylindrical symmetry of the system and the regular field to be azimuthal , the parallel diffusion coefficient plays no role and the macroscopic current is simply given by @xmath48 here , @xmath38 is considered to be a positive - definite quantity ( corresponding to the diffusion of positively charged particles ) , while any sign changes arising from possible changes in the orientation of the regular field are contained in * b*. this agrees with refs .",
    "@xcite but differs from the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in terms of cylindrical coordinates , eq.([diffeq ] )",
    "is explicitly given by @xmath49 \\phi = q\\ , \\label{difeqcil}\\ ] ] where the drift velocities are @xmath50 and @xmath51 notice that , since @xmath52 , a change in the orientation of the regular field introduces a singular contribution to the drift velocities .    in order to deal with analytical solutions , we will consider here a simplified approach in which @xmath37 is spatially homogeneous , while @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "let us consider a regular field antisymmetric with respect to the galactic plane ( i.e. @xmath54 ) .",
    "the drift velocities are @xmath55 i.e. the vertical drifts are directed outwards the galactic plane , while on the plane there is a singular radial drift velocity directed towards the galactic center .",
    "since the sources are located mainly in the galactic plane , their distribution is considered to be given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the radial source distribution , @xmath58 is a nominal vertical scale length and @xmath59 the index of the source differential spectrum . as said above",
    ", we will consider that galactic crs are accelerated in supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "hence , the source distribution will be given by the snr radial profile @xcite @xmath60 with @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63  kpc .",
    "regarding the snr population close to the gc ( i.e. for @xmath64  kpc ) , we will assume here a constant value ( that matches the snr population at @xmath65  kpc ) , since a non negligible snr density is likely to exist in the gc region .",
    "this assumption is indeed consistent with the available observations @xcite .",
    "as the galaxy is assumed to be flat ( @xmath66 ) , one can neglect the radial gradients as compared to the gradients in @xmath67 and the solution to the diffusion equation is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this flux , @xmath70 , is a single - component solution ( as if all crs were , say , protons ) .",
    "further below we consider the total cr flux , @xmath30 , which takes into account all relevant nuclear contributions . also notice that , as expected from the radial drift velocity pointing towards the gc , the density at a given radius @xmath71 receives the contribution from all sources located at larger radii , @xmath72 , while the outwardly directed vertical drifts tend to remove the crs from the galactic plane . in order to make explicit the dependence of @xmath73 on the cr energy ,",
    "we can conveniently rewrite it as @xmath74 where @xmath75  gev is the energy of the knee and @xmath76 a constant parameter of order unity . to reproduce the local cr observations",
    ", we will assume here the plausible value @xmath77 .",

    "this program provides an accurate representation of event properties in a wide range of reactions , and particularly on those involving strong interactions , where multihadronic final states are produced .",
    "lacking an exact description , the program makes use of a combination of analytical results and various qcd - based models , which are then implemented to model hard subprocesses , initial- and final - state parton showers , remnants and underlying events , fragmentation and decays , etc .",
    "the decay of long - lived particles , which are considered to be stable in the context of collider physics applications , was enabled in our simulations in order to include the main galactic neutrino production channels .",

    "fluxes are given per flavor , but adding neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the interactions between cr particles and the ism produce roughly twice as many @xmath86 than @xmath87 , but at their arrival at the earth the produced neutrinos are evenly distributed among the three flavors due to vacuum oscillations during propagation @xcite .",
    "since , as discussed above , both the ism and the cr densities are largest in the gc region , the neutrino flux is maximally enhanced along the gc direction .",
    "drift effects also enhance the galactic anisotropies , which are indeed the main signature to distinguish this diffuse galactic signal from other diffuse stationary extraterrestrial neutrino fluxes .",
    "figure 3 also shows the neutrino flux that would be produced in this same direction if the cr density were homogeneous over the whole galaxy ( i.e. ignoring the inhomogeneous distribution of cr sources and all propagation effects , and just taking into account the local cr observations ) .",
    "as anticipated , a large enhancement takes place at high neutrino energies above @xmath88  gev .",
    "also notice the flux increment taking place at very high energies for the ( @xmath89 ) direction , which is due to the vertical drifts that remove the cr particles from the galactic plane .",
    "= 5.truein=3.5truein    in order to compare the diffuse galactic signal to other high energy neutrino fluxes , figure 4 shows the galactic signal produced in the gc direction , together with the atmospheric conventional fluxes ( averaged over zenith angle ) , the atmospheric prompt flux and the waxman - bahcall prediction for extragalactic neutrinos produced in grbs @xcite .",
    "also shown is the latest amanda limit on the high energy neutrino flux , obtained from their shower analysis @xcite and consistent with previous results from the baikal experiment @xcite .",
    "the two curves for the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux indicate the adopted range of small-@xmath3 qcd uncertainties ( for further details , see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . the prompt flux , however , could be larger than shown here , becoming indeed the dominating high energy signal for directions outside the gc region @xcite .    according to figure 4 ,",
    "the galactic flux from the gc is the dominant non - conventional high energy neutrino signal . as shown before , this signal is highly anisotropic in galactic coordinates ( see fig.3 ) and the fluxes coming from outside the gc region are expected to fall by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "hence , this scenario is optimistic as regards the detection of a high energy diffuse component of extragalactic origin . in this respect ,",
    "very useful information on the galactic diffuse background ( for directions outside the gc region ) can be drawn from the detection of the galactic signal in the gc direction .",
    "= 5.truein=3.5truein    figure 5 shows the integral event rates corresponding to the fluxes given in figure 4 , as expected for a km@xmath1-size detector observing the region ( @xmath90 ) for 10 years of data taking .",
    "we focus here on shower ( cascade ) event rates produced by downgoing neutrinos .",
    "notice that the angular range considered is consistent with the @xmath91 angular resolution expected for showers in icecube .",
    "being located at the south pole , icecube is capable of probing the gc region by means of downgoing neutrinos . for tev energies ,",
    "the downgoing @xmath86 charged - current ( cc ) events are overcome by the much larger background of downgoing atmospheric muons . instead",
    ", downgoing neutrinos can be measured by the observation of electromagnetic / hadronic cascades produced by neutrino interactions occurring within or near the detector fiducial volume @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the observation of shower events ( without lepton tracks ) is particularly sensitive to the @xmath87 cc channel @xcite and allows an effective reduction of the conventional background relative to any high energy signal ( being either the prompt atmospheric flux , or an extraterrestrial component ) .",
    "in fact , the visible energy that can be reconstructed from a shower event , @xmath92 , is roughly the same as the incoming neutrino energy for a cc @xmath87 interaction , while in a neutral - current ( nc ) interaction @xmath92 is smaller by a factor @xmath93 .",
    "this effect , convolved with the very steeply falling incoming spectra , and together with the additional suppression due to the smaller nc cross sections , yields nc @xmath86 shower fluxes which are suppressed by roughly an order of magnitude relative to the shower fluxes arising via cc @xmath87 interactions .",
    "the shower detection channel was indeed recently proposed as a novel technique to isolate the prompt atmospheric flux ( see ref .",
    "a further analysis of the sensitivity of the shower channel in icecube , as well as its comparison with the complementary up- and down - going muon track channels , is accomplished in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite the event rates being small , figure 5 shows that the detection of the diffuse galactic signal in a km@xmath1-size telescope such as icecube is feasible and realistic .",
    "a background subtraction of the conventional flux ( which can be measured with large statistics at lower energies ) would allow the identification of this relatively large galactic signal at energies above @xmath0  gev .",
    "let us finally comment on the implications of this scenario for the observations of galactic diffuse gamma - rays above tev energies , an exciting new window on the high energy universe opened by the measurements by the cangaroo , veritas , h.e.s.s . and milagro collaborations .",
    "besides the hadronic ( @xmath94 decay ) channel , the galactic diffuse photons can be produced by other processes such as high energy electron bremstrahlung and inverse compton scattering with the interstellar radiation field .",
    "very recently , the milagro gamma ray observatory reported the first observations of a diffuse galactic plane gamma - ray signal at tev energies @xcite .    following a procedure analogous to that described at the beginning of this section",
    ", we calculated the photon differential flux produced by cosmic ray interactions in the ism .",
    "in particular , the integral flux averaged over the region ( @xmath95 ) , i.e. the so - called milagro inner galaxy , is given by @xmath96  @xmath97s@xmath98sr@xmath98 , which is consistent with the milagro results @xcite .",
    "further work on the implications of the drift - enhanced cr densities for the gamma - ray observations above tev energies is under progress and will appear in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the signal of diffuse neutrinos arising from interactions between crs and the ism in the milky way was reconsidered here taking into account a realistic scenario for the cr transport .",
    "the combined effect arising from an inhomogeneous distribution of cr sources ( which , according to the standard picture , are assumed as snrs ) and from the onset of cr drifts ( which could be also responsible for the observed knees in the local cr spectrum ) is shown to produce large inhomogeneities in the galactic cr density .",
    "in particular , this phenomenon could drive a large accumulation of crs in the gc region , where the ism density is also largest , thus enhancing the fluxes expected for the diffuse galactic signal of neutrinos . from our estimates for the event rates expected in a large , km@xmath1-size detector such as icecube , the detection of this signal turns out to be quite plausible .",
    "these prospects of detection would be even better for larger experimental facilities , as e.g. in the proposed icecube plus project @xcite .",
    "this neutrino flux would provide important information on the galactic cr puzzle and on related aspects of great astrophysical interest : the nature and the distribution of the cr sources , the structure and intensity of the galactic magnetic fields , the matter distribution of the ism , etc .",
    "furthermore , the detection of this extraterrestrial signal could be used to test for new physics beyond the standard model ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the distinct signature that allows to identify this diffuse galactic flux is the large galactic anisotropy .",
    "indeed , the intensity from directions outside the gc region falls below the other expected high energy neutrino components .",
    "hence , the detection of the galactic signal from the gc region could also provide very valuable information for understanding and estimating its impact as a background for measuring extragalactic neutrino fluxes in other directions .",
    "furthermore , an increased population of crs in the gc region also could have an impact on the production of neutrons via proton - proton interactions @xcite and nuclear photodisintegration due to ambient radiation fields @xcite . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , these neutron production and decay processes may lead to detectable gamma - ray and neutrino signals .",
    "finally , let us recall that neutrons escaping from the gc region were also proposed as an explanation of the cr anisotropies observed by the agasa and sugar experiments at eev energies @xcite .",
    "however , these observations remain controversial , since they were not confirmed by the recent analysis performed with larger statistics by the pierre auger collaboration @xcite .",

    "<S> we examine in detail the detectability of a signal of diffuse high energy neutrinos produced in the milky way by the interaction of cosmic rays ( crs ) with the interstellar medium ( ism ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that highly inhomogeneous galactic cr densities arise naturally from large scale drift effects and the inhomogeneous distribution of cr sources </S>",
    "<S> . in particular , the cr density in the galactic center region ( where the ism density is maximal ) could be an order of magnitude larger than the local cr density . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the expected diffuse flux of neutrinos from the galactic center region becomes enhanced and could be detected at energies above @xmath0  gev in a km@xmath1-size neutrino telescope within 10 years of operation . </S>",
    "<S> the galactic anisotropy , which is the main signature of this flux , allows to discriminate this signal from other possible extraterrestrial diffuse fluxes of high energy neutrinos .    </S>",
