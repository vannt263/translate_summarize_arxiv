    "the theoretical description of the kondo lattice remains an outstanding problem of solid state physics .",
    "this model , or variations of it , may be viewed as the appropriate one for understanding such intensively investigated classes of materials as the heavy electron metals@xcite , kondo insulators@xcite and possibly the recently discovered@xcite transition metal hydride - based switchable mirror compounds @xcite .",
    "the simplest model which incorporates the essential physics may be written as @xmath1 here we consider the minimal model , where each unit cell contains two orbitals , one of them for the mobile conduction electrons the other for the strongly correlated @xmath0-electrons .",
    "then , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) creates a conduction electron ( @xmath0-electron ) in cell @xmath4 , and @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 is the fourier transform of the inter - cell hopping integral @xmath8 for @xmath9 electrons . for later reference",
    "we have already included a coulomb repulsion @xmath10 between @xmath0 and conduction electrons in the same cell , and a coulomb repulsion @xmath11 between conduction electrons .",
    "the latter two parameters are usually taken to be zero , but as will be seen below our formalism allows to take them into without any additional effort .",
    "in the so - called symmetric case , @xmath12 and the limit @xmath13 ( [ kondo1 ] ) , can be reduced to its strong coupling limit@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 denotes the spin operator for conduction electrons ( @xmath0-electrons ) in cell @xmath4 and @xmath17 .",
    "+ while the impurity versions of these models , which retain only a single @xmath0-site in a sea of conduction electrons , are well understood@xcite and are even amenable to exact solutions@xcite , much less is known about the lattice models .",
    "one problem which by many is believed to be at the heart of the solution is the way in which the more or less localized @xmath0-electrons , which in the strong coupling theory are replaced by mere spin degrees of freedom , participate in the formation of the fermi surface and the heavy quasiparticle bands .",
    "experiments on heavy fermion compounds@xcite , computer simulations of kondo lattices@xcite and theoretical considerations@xcite suggest that despite their frozen charge degrees of freedom , the @xmath0-electrons participate in the fermi surface volume as if they were uncorrelated .",
    "in other words , the experimental fermi surface volume corresponds to the case @xmath18 .",
    "the limiting cases @xmath19@xmath6@xmath20 or @xmath21@xmath6@xmath20 , which obviously do not allow for participation of the @xmath0 electrons in the fermi surface , therefore represent singular points , so that a perturbation expansion in the ( small ) parameters @xmath19 or @xmath21 may not be expected to give meaningful results .",
    "rather , the interaction between @xmath0-spins and conduction electrons must be incorporated in a non - perturbative way , in a similar manner as the single - impurity kondo effect@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present manuscript to present a minimum effort theory for the kondo lattice which is based on this basic requirement and shows how the nominal participation of the localized electrons in the fermi surface can be understood even in the complete absence of any true hybridization .",
    "we describe the system by an effective hamiltonian for the fermion - like charge fluctuations on top of a strong coupling ground state , and show that this treatment leads to remarkable agreement with numerical results at least on energy scales which are relevant to high - energy spectroscopy .",
    "we would also like to point out that the method of calculation is similar in spirit to the cell - perturbation method developed by jefferson and coworkers@xcite .",
    "a preliminary report has been published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "as our starting point we choose the case of vanishing inter - cell hopping @xmath8 ( i.e. @xmath22 ) .",
    "the lattice problem then reduces to single cell problems so that we first discuss the eigenstates of a single cell with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 electrons .",
    "the two electron ground state is a singlet with wave function @xmath26\\;|vac\\rangle \\label{two0}\\ ] ] ( we have suppressed the site index on the fermion creation operators ) .",
    "the ground state wave function and energy is then obtained by diagonalizing the @xmath27 matrix @xmath28 for the strong coupling model ( [ kondo2 ] ) the problem becomes trivial with @xmath29@xmath6@xmath30@xmath6@xmath20 , @xmath31@xmath6@xmath23 , the energy of the two - electron ground state is @xmath32 . + the single or three electron states can be written as @xmath33 and the wave functions and energies are obtained by diagonalizing the matrices @xmath34 [ h1e ] and @xmath35 for the strong coupling limit the index @xmath36 takes only one value and we have @xmath37@xmath6@xmath38@xmath39 , and @xmath40@xmath6@xmath41@xmath42 . both the single and three electron states have zero energy in this case . + for later reference , we also define the photoemission ( pes ) and inverse photoemission ( ipes ) matrix elements ( here @xmath29@xmath6@xmath43 ) @xmath44 they can be expressed in terms of the wave functions defined above , e.g. @xmath45 where the additional sign in the first equation is due to our convention for ordering the two spin directions in ( [ two0])@xcite .",
    "+ we now return to the lattice problem and consider the case of half - filling ( i.e. two electrons / unit cell , corresponding to the kondo insulator ) . for vanishing @xmath8",
    "the lattice ground state is simply the product of @xmath46 single - cell ground states of the type ( [ two0 ] ) ( see the state labeled ( a ) in figure [ fig1 ] ) . in the following",
    ", this state will be referred to as the vaccuum .",
    "then , switching on @xmath8 produces charge fluctuations in the vacuum state : an electron can    = 12.1 cm    hop from cell @xmath4 to another cell @xmath47 , leaving the cell @xmath4 in a single electron eigenstate with number @xmath36 , and the cell @xmath47 in a three electron eigenstate with number @xmath48 ( see state ( b ) in figure [ fig1 ] ) . in a further step",
    "an electron from the three - fold occupied cell @xmath47 can hop to another neighbor @xmath49 leaving cell @xmath47 in a two - hole eigenstate and @xmath49 in a three hole state ( see figure [ fig1]c ) or , alternatively , an electron can hop from another neighbor @xmath50 into cell @xmath4 , leaving @xmath4 in a two electron state , @xmath50 in a single electron state .",
    "finally , an electron from @xmath47 can hop into @xmath4 , leaving both @xmath4 and @xmath47 in two - electron states . in this picture",
    "the inter - cell kinetic energy may be viewed of as a perturbation which has a two - fold effect : the pair creation of charge fluctuations and the propagation of these .",
    "it therefore plays a completely analogous role as the transverse part of the heisenberg exchange in the linear spin wave theory for the heisenberg antiferromagnet , and in the following we want to exploit this analogy . to that end",
    "we make the additional assumption that a cell containing @xmath24 electrons must always be in the @xmath24-electron ground state @xmath51 .",
    "this means that after a charge fluctuation has passed through a given cell , the cell must return to the two - electron ground state . in other words , under this constraint the propagating charge fluctuations do not leave a trace of excited cells - their propagation becomes coherent .",
    "ways to relax this constraint and take into account incoherent processes will be discussed below .",
    "+ as a last important step , we note that the pair creation process in figure [ fig1 ] changes the energy by @xmath52 ( which is nothing but the conductivity gap of a single cell ) , and that the switching of e.g. a hole - like charge fluctuation from species @xmath36 to species @xmath53 changes the energy by @xmath54 . to keep track of these changes in energy , we interpret the difference @xmath55@xmath6@xmath56 as the ` energy of formation ' of the hole species @xmath36 ( and analogously for electron - like fluctuations ) .",
    "+ we now define our restricted set of basis states : @xmath57 with the side condition that @xmath58 automatically implies @xmath59 . in the following ,",
    "we will diagonalize the hamiltonian in the subspace of the states ( [ basis ] ) . to that end",
    ", we represent the basis states ( [ basis ] ) in terms of ` model fermions'@xcite : if a cell with number @xmath4 is in the two - hole ground state we say it is empty ; if the cell is in the @xmath60 single electron state with @xmath61-spin @xmath62 we model this by the presence of a hole - like fermion , created by @xmath63 ; and if there are three electrons forming the @xmath64 single cell state with @xmath61-spin @xmath62 we say that the cell is occupied by an electron - like model fermion , created by @xmath65 .",
    "then , solving @xmath66 in the restricted basis ( [ basis ] ) obviously is equivalent to diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath67@xmath6@xmath68 where @xmath69 with @xmath70 here @xmath71 projects onto the subspace of states where no site is occupied by more than one fermion .",
    "this kinematic constraint reflects the fact that the state of a given cell must be unique .",
    "due to the product nature of the basis states ( [ basis ] ) , the evaluation of the matrix elements of the inter - cell kinetic energy ( [ mats ] ) reduces to the calculation of matrix elements between products of no more than two single cell states .",
    "the matrix elements on the r.h.s . of ( [ mats ] )",
    "are therefore simply products of the @xmath9-like photoemission and inverse photoemission matrix elements for a single cell ( [ mats0 ] ) ; this corresponds to the quite intuitive picture that the propagation of a @xmath9-electron is equivalent to photoemisson in one cell , and inverse photoemission in the neighboring one .",
    "the respective matrix elements give the renormalization of the inter - cell hopping due to intra - cell ( i.e. local ) correlation effects . also , as long as the interaction between electrons contains only intra - cell terms the entire strong correlation physics obviously is completely taken care of by the calculation of the single - cell states , and only enters via the single cell energies @xmath72 and @xmath73 . thus , while we are presently only using coulomb repulsions as intra - cell interactions , hund s rule exchange or electron phonon coupling could also be treated in the same way .",
    "+ having computed the matrix elements and excitation energies the most obvious next step then is ( in analogy to linear spin wave theory ) to relax the constraint enforced by @xmath71 , whereupon the hamiltonian ( [ eff ] ) is readily solved by bogoliubov transformation .",
    "this gives us the energies and dispersion , and for the full kondo lattice hamiltonian we obtain @xmath74 bands ( we have two hole - like and two electron - like model fermions ) , whereas for the strong coupling version we have only two . for the latter case , ( [ eff ] ) takes the form @xmath75 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\bbox{k},\\sigma } sign(\\sigma)\\ ; \\epsilon_{\\bbox{k } } \\ ; ( b_{\\bbox{k},\\sigma}^\\dagger a_{-\\bbox{k},\\bar{\\sigma}}^\\dagger   + h.c . ) .",
    "\\label{stcham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is readily solved by the ansatz @xmath76 and ,",
    "introducing @xmath77@xmath6@xmath78 , we obtain the quasiparticle dispersion @xmath79 , \\label{scdisp}\\ ] ] shown in figure [ fig2]a . at half - filling ,",
    "particle - hole symmetry requires the chemical potential to be zero , so that the lower of the two bands ( [ scdisp ] ) is completely filled , the upper one completely empty .",
    "we note that formally ( [ scdisp ] ) is completely equivalent to the hybridization of a dispersionless effective @xmath0-level in the band center with a free    electron band with dispersion @xmath5 , the strength of the nominal mixing element being @xmath77 .",
    "this results in the heavy , i.e. almost dispersionless bands immediately above and below the fermi energy in figure [ fig2 ] - the slope of these bands decreases strongly with decreasing @xmath21",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the resulting energy gap of @xmath77 does _ not _ arise from the formation of a bonding and antibonding combination of @xmath9-like and @xmath0-like bloch states , as in the hybridization model ; rather , this gap originates from the energy cost to break two intra - cell singlets in the first step of a charge fluctuation .",
    "this gap therefore is of a very similar nature as the energy gap in a superconductor : the minimum energy for moving an electron from some site @xmath4 to a distant site @xmath47 ( which by definition is the single particle gap of the system ) is two times the energy required to break a pair ( which may be either a kondo singlet or a cooper pair : the first pair is broken at site @xmath4 , because one member of the pair is removed - the second pair is broken at site @xmath47 because the surpuls electron interferes with the pair formation around this site .",
    "to compute the full single particle spectral function we need to resolve the ordinary electron creation and annihilation operators in terms of the model fermions , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . taking into account our basic assumption , namely that a single cell with @xmath24 electrons can only be in its ground state",
    ", we can expand the electron annihilation operator ( where @xmath82 ) @xmath83 taking matrix elements of both sides we readily find that @xmath84@xmath6@xmath85 , @xmath86@xmath6@xmath87 .",
    "next , we can replace e.g. @xmath88 and thus have the desired resolution of the photoemission operator .",
    "specializing to the strong coupling limit , the annihilation operator for @xmath9-electrons takes the form @xmath89 using ( [ ansatz ] ) we can now resolve the annihilation operator in terms of the quasiparticles , obtain its matrix element and square it to obtain the spectral weight in the lower ( i.e. occupied ) band as @xmath90 let us assume that @xmath91 and let @xmath92 be in the outer part of the brillouin zone , i.e. we assume that we are deep in the heavy portion of the occupied band ( see figure [ fig2]a ) .",
    "then , we find @xmath93 i.e. the heavy band does have an extremely small spectral weight ( see the lower part of figure [ fig2]a ) .",
    "this will turn out to be of considerable importance in a minute .",
    "+ to proceed to the doped case , we need an expression for the electron number operator .",
    "while at first sight this may appear a triviality , we will now see that one thereby runs into a rather deep - rooted problem , which reflects the special features of the strong correlation problem . in the vacuum state",
    "the number of electrons ( counting @xmath9 _ and _ @xmath0-electrons ) is @xmath94 and the presence of an @xmath80-fermion ( @xmath81-fermion ) decreases ( increases ) the electron number by @xmath23 , so that for the full kondo lattice the electron number operator should be simply @xmath95 for the strong coupling limit , we obtain in an analogous fashion @xmath96 the extra @xmath97 on the r.h.s . of ( [ count ] )",
    "simply cancels the lowest of the @xmath74 bands obtained in the full kondo lattice .",
    "as will be seen below , this is a practically dispersionless lower hubbard band for the @xmath0-electrons , which is absent in the strong coupling limit ( or better : pushed to @xmath98 ) .",
    "the fermi surfaces of both models thus are completely equivalent , and e.g. for the case of hole doping in @xmath99 one would obtain a fermi momentum @xmath100@xmath6@xmath101 ( where @xmath102 denotes the density of conduction electrons ) in the lower hybridization band .",
    "this implies that we have a fermi surface which satisfies a nominal luttinger theorem , i.e. the @xmath0 -electrons are treated as participating in the fermi surface .",
    "the physical origin , however , is the fact that we have a density @xmath103 of holes in the singlet background , which forms the vacuum for our treatment .",
    "this results in a hole pocket centered on @xmath104 with fermi momentum @xmath105 .",
    "the resulting fermi surface then is _ nominally _ equivalent to a luttinger fermi surface _ including _ the @xmath0-electrons and obviously this equivalence holds true irrespectively of dimensionality and fermi surface topology .",
    "we believe that this is the reason why the @xmath0-electrons _ seem to _ participate in the fermi surface volume despite the fact that they are localized . at half - filling",
    ", we do not have a half - filled band of single - particle like mixtures of @xmath9 and @xmath0-electrons - such a picture is obviously completely wrong for the strong - coupling model .",
    "rather , the half - filled ground state should be viewed as an array of local singlets , where each @xmath0-spin captures one conduction electron to form an immobile singlet .",
    "the system has a single particle gap because removing an electron and re - inserting it at a far away site breaks two of the local singlets , in a completely analogous fashion as in a superconductor .",
    "unlike a superconductor , the two members of each pair do belong to different species , whereby the number of one of the species , the @xmath0-electrons is essentially independent of the total electron density .",
    "removing electrons from the system thus produces holes in the singlet background and leaves behind unpaired @xmath0-electrons . unlike the actual @xmath0-electrons , which are largely immobile ( completely immobile for the strong - coupling model ) the holes are mobile , because an @xmath0-electron can form a pair with a @xmath9-electron from a nearby pair , thereby leaving another @xmath0-electron unpaired .",
    "+ however , there is still a major complication : the electron number must also equal the @xmath92 and @xmath106 integrated photoemission weight , which is given by the expectation value of the operator @xmath107 inserting the expansion ( [ exp ] ) of the @xmath9 and @xmath0 electrons in terms of the model fermions into this expression it is easy to see that in general @xmath108 .",
    "for example in the strong coupling limit we find using ( [ scphoto ] ) @xmath109 + n. \\label{count1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we thus arrive at the at first sight devastating conclusion that counting the electrons in real space on one hand and integrating the spectral weight in @xmath92-space on the other hand give us different results for the electron number .",
    "on the other hand , this is not an indication for a qualitative flaw in our theory , but has a very clear and simple physical origin , namely the fact that in a strongly correlated electron system spectral weight and band structure are completely decoupled . as an example , let us consider the band structure shown in figure [ fig2]a . if one simply were to introduce a chemical potential corresponding to the real - space electron count ( [ count_sc ] ) the fermi energy would necessarily cut into the heavy part of the lower band",
    "let us assume that the only effect of doping were that @xmath100 progressively cuts deeper into the heavy band portion of the otherwise completely rigid quasiparticle band structure calculated above .",
    "trivially , for the @xmath99 chain the number of occupied momenta , @xmath110 would change with @xmath100 as @xmath111 on the other hand , the integrated photoemission weight , @xmath112 , would change as @xmath113 introducing a simple chemical potential following ( [ count_sc ] ) into an otherwise rigid quasiparticle band structure thus inevitably leads to the breakdown of the sum rule for the integrated photoemission weight .",
    "the breakdown of rigid - band behaviour and the failure of a simple electron count are therefore a completely natural consequence of the special feature of strongly correlated electrons , namely that they may have quasiparticle weights which substantially deviate from unity .",
    "+ in order to cope with this problem , we try the simplest possible solution and enforce the consistency of ordinary electron count and spectral weight integration by adding both expressions , ( [ count_sc ] ) and ( [ count1 ] ) , for the electron number to the hamiltonian , each one with a separate lagrangian multiplier : @xmath114 the notion of two chemical potentials may seem awkward at first sight , but as will be shown now , this approach results in a remarkable consistency with the numerical results .",
    "let us again consider the strong coupling limit .",
    "the spectral weight operator @xmath115 takes the same form as the kinetic energy , but with the replacement @xmath116 or , equivalently , @xmath117 .",
    "the hamiltonian thus becomes @xmath118\\ ; a_{\\bbox{k},\\sigma}^\\dagger a_{\\bbox{k},\\sigma}^ { }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & [ ( \\epsilon_{\\bbox{k}}-\\lambda)+\\frac{3j}{2 } -2\\mu ] \\ ; b_{\\bbox{k},\\sigma}^\\dagger b_{\\bbox{k},\\sigma}^{}\\ ;   \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\bbox{k},\\sigma } sign(\\sigma ) ( \\epsilon_{\\bbox{k}}-\\lambda ) ( b_{\\bbox{k},\\sigma}^\\dagger a_{\\bbox{k},\\bar{\\sigma}}^\\dagger + h.c . ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that , using again ( [ ansatz ] ) , we find the dispersion @xmath119 - \\mu . \\label{scdisp1}\\ ] ] using the representation of the spectral operators , we obtain the momentum distribution / spin direction of the conduction electrons : @xmath120 then , for @xmath121 we may replace the denominator on the r.h.s .",
    "by @xmath122 and obtain @xmath123 .",
    "this is simply the free - electron result . for @xmath124",
    "on the other hand , we find @xmath125 .",
    "let us now discuss these results . to begin with , the real space chemical potential @xmath48 acts like a standard chemical potential , which cuts into the heavy band and , as discussed above , produces a fermi surface consistent with the nominal luttinger theorem .",
    "on the other hand , the chemical potential for the spectral weight , @xmath126 , gives rise to a pseudo fermi surface for the conduction electrons , where @xmath127 drops sharply but continuously from a value @xmath128 to nearly @xmath20 ( see figure [ fig2]b ) .",
    "since the integrated @xmath9-distribution must equal the number of conduction electrons , it is clear that @xmath129 , with @xmath130 the fermi momentum for _ unhybridized _ conduction electrons .",
    "carrying on the formal analogy of ( [ scdisp1 ] ) with a hybridization gap picture , @xmath126 obviously plays the role of an on - site energy of the effective @xmath0 level , and therefore the line @xmath131 marks the locus in @xmath92 space where the strongly dispersive conduction - band bends over into the nearly flat heavy band ( see figure [ fig2]b ) in other words , the band structure of the kondo lattice is equivalent to an effective @xmath0-level , which is pinned near the frozen core fermi energy for conduction electrons of density @xmath132 , and which mixes into the conduction band with a matrix element of strength @xmath133 .",
    "we note that this is very much what one would expect intuitively : in the limit @xmath134 the kinetic energy of the @xmath9-electrons is by far the dominant energy contribution of the system .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath135 and obviously the minimum value compatible with the pauli principle is obtained by the free electron distribution for the conduction electrons .",
    "then , in order to recover a ( small ) additional energy @xmath136 from the kondo - hybridization , the system will not sacrifice much kinetic energy , i.e. @xmath137 will stay close to its free - electron shape .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows @xmath138 for a @xmath99 chain of the strong coupling model with @xmath132@xmath6@xmath139 , evaluated numerically by solving self - consistently for @xmath48 and @xmath126 , for different values of @xmath140 .",
    "for very large @xmath21 ( which is an unphysical limiting case ) @xmath138 is nearly constant and drops to @xmath20 at @xmath141 , the fermi momentum for hybridized conduction and @xmath0 electrons .",
    "as @xmath21 is reduced , the fermi surface discontinuity shrinks more and more ( but stays finite at any @xmath21 ) and the pseudo fermi surface at @xmath130@xmath6@xmath142 starts to develop .",
    "this behaviour of @xmath138 is in almost quantitative agreement with the dmrg results of moukuri and caron@xcite , which may show the quality of our simple analytical calculation .",
    "+ having discussed the strong coupling version , we now turn to the full kondo lattice problem .",
    "thereby we encounter a new problem . in the strong coupling version ,",
    "we have introduced the pseudo chemical potential @xmath126 in order to enforce the consistency of real - space electron count and integrated photoemission weight ; clearly we will have to do the same thing for the full kondo lattice .",
    "for the full model , however , there is an additional distinction to be made because now we have @xmath9-like and @xmath0-like spectral weight , and we need to make sure that the total spectral weight is distributed between the two species in a proper version .",
    "we will see that this enforces to introduce yet another lagrange multiplier which essentially governs the ratio of @xmath9-like to @xmath0-like weight .",
    "+ to that end , let us first construct an operator which counts the total number of @xmath29-type electrons ( where @xmath82 ) . to begin with ,",
    "we define the expectation values of the electron numbers in the single cell states : @xmath143 these expectation values are readily computed from the single cell wave functions , e.g. @xmath144@xmath6@xmath145 . by analogy with ( [ count1 ] )",
    "we may thus write down the following operator to count the total number of @xmath29-electrons : @xmath146 using @xmath147@xmath6@xmath4 we find @xmath148@xmath149@xmath150@xmath6@xmath151 , with @xmath151 given by ( [ count ] ) ( as it has to be ) .",
    "on the other hand by using the resolutions ( [ exp ] ) of the @xmath29 operators we can form the operators @xmath152@xmath6@xmath153 , which give the integrated spectral weight for the @xmath29-electrons alone .",
    "we then replace the hamiltonian @xmath154 we determine @xmath126 from the condition @xmath155@xmath6@xmath151 ( @xmath126 thus has precisely the same meaning as for the strong coupling limit discussed above ) and @xmath156 from the requirement @xmath157 .",
    "this implies that automatically also @xmath158 , whence we have reached ` species wise ' consistency between real - space electron count and integrated spectral weight .",
    "using the eigenenergies obtained by diagonalizing the effective hamiltonian ( [ hfinal ] ) with the self - consistently determined values of the lagrange multipliers @xmath126 and @xmath156 we obtain the band dispersions . combining the resolutions ( [ exp ] ) of the @xmath9 and @xmath0-operators in terms of the model fermions and the eigenvectors obtained by diagonalizing ( [ hfinal ] ) we can compute the photoemission and inverse photoemission matrix elements , so that we can obtain the photoemission spectrum @xmath159 and the inverse photoemisison spectrum @xmath160 where @xmath82 .",

    "@xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "while there is no rigorous justification for this procedure , inspection of the numerical spectra shows that one can obtain remarkably smooth band structures in this way .",
    "+ to begin with , figure [ fig4 ] shows the lanczos result for the single particle spectral function for a @xmath99 chain of the ` pure ' kondo lattice , i.e. @xmath10@xmath6@xmath11@xmath39 , figure [ fig5 ] shows the    = 8.1 cm    result obtained from the theory ( similar lanczos spectra with slightly different parameters have also been obtained by tsutsui _",
    "et al._@xcite ) . to begin with ,",
    "in contrast to any band theory approach , our theoretical spectrum correctly reproduces the @xmath74 well - distinguishable bands in the numerical spectra : the practically dispersionless upper and lower hubbard band , which have almost pure @xmath0-character , and the two hybridization bands , which    = 8.1 cm    = 8.1 cm    resemble the strong coupling - result ( [ scdisp ] ) .",
    "the basic idea of our approach , namely to broaden the ionization and affinity states of a single cell into bands thus obviously works quite well .",
    "the spectra nicely show the pseudo fermi surface for the @xmath9-electrons : while the true fermi momentum in the doped case is at @xmath100@xmath6@xmath164 , where the heavy band intersects @xmath165 ( although this is not easily recognized in the theoretical spectra ) , there is a pronounced transfer of @xmath9-like spectral weight from below to above @xmath165 at @xmath166 .",
    "this means that doping shifts the drop of the momentum distribution for the @xmath9-electrons ( which is nothing but the integrated @xmath9-weight below @xmath165 ) from    = 8.1 cm    @xmath167 to @xmath168 - this is preciseley the pseudo fermi surface discussed above for the strong coupling limit ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the theoretical spectra somewhat overestimate the weight of the heavy @xmath0-like portions in the hybridization bands , moreover the position of the @xmath0-like hubbard bands is shifted to slightly too high ( binding ) energies . on the other hand , the fermiology is reproduced quite well .",
    "it is interesting to note that qualitatively identical results for smaller values of @xmath169 and @xmath170 and lower electron filling have been obtained by tahvildar - zadeh _ at al._@xcite using the @xmath171 technique - quite obviously there is overall agreement between different numerical approaches , for quite different parameters values and fillings ( and our analytical results ) .",

    "as expected , the upper hubbard band for the @xmath0-electrons is virtually absent .",

    "the lanczos spectrum for half - filling shows some diffuse @xmath0-weight roughly in this area , and even some indication of peaks in the doped case .",
    "next , the dispersion of the hybridization bands shows a quite pronounced asymmetry between photoemisison and inverse photoemission , which is nicely reproduced by the theory .",
    "the explanation is simple : due to the reduced energy of the pure @xmath0-state @xmath174 the weight of this state in the single cell ground state for two electrons @xmath51 must increase .",
    "the weight of the two remaining states therefore must decrease , so that the overall probability to find a @xmath9-electron in the ground state is reduced ( this manifests itself also by the significantly smaller integrated @xmath9-weight in the photoemission spectrum ) . since only the @xmath9-electrons can hop between cells , the band - width seen in photoemission therefore will be reduced .",
    "next , since the @xmath9-weight which disappears from the photoemission part must reappear in the inverse photoemission spectrum , it follows from analogous considerations that the dispersion in the ipes part will be enhanced . as was the case in the symmetric case ,",
    "doping causes a shift of the chemical potential into the lower hybridization band , but there is now also some change of the spectral character of the upper hybridization band near @xmath104 : there the @xmath9-character increases , the @xmath0-character decreases with doping , and the theoretical spectra obviously do correctly reproduce this trend .",
    "+ next , we study a more complicated form of the hopping term for conduction electrons .",
    "more precisley , we introduce a hopping integral between second nearest neighbors , and to have a pronounced effect we choose this to be of equal magnitude , but opposite sign as the nearest neighbor hopping . in other words ,",
    "the conduction electrons now have the dispersion relation @xmath175    = 8.1 cm    for the band fillings under consideration , a system of noninteracting electrons thus would have @xmath74 fermi points rather than @xmath24 , and we want to see if our simple ` rule of thumb ' deduced above for the band structure in the strong coupling limit continues to be valid also in this more complicated situation .",
    "namely the band structure of the kondo lattice should be qualitatively given by the one obtained for mixing with a dispersionless @xmath0-level , that is pinned to the ` frozen core ' fermi energy of the non - hybridizing conduction band , see figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "then , figure [ fig8 ] shows the lanczos result for the single particle spectral function and figure [ fig9 ] shows the theoretical    = 8.1 cm    data .",
    "it is quite obvious that the theory remains valid also in this case .",
    "the relatively complicated band structure predicted by the rule of thumb indeed can be seen quite well in the lanczos spectra : the @xmath176-shaped conduction band , with a local maximum at @xmath177 , which crosses from inverse photoemission and back again and thereby mixes with the dispersionless , low intensity @xmath0-band ( it should be noted that the low intensity @xmath0-like peaks at @xmath164 and @xmath178 in the lanczos spectra for @xmath179 are actually on the photoemission side ) . with doping away from half - filling the heavy band near @xmath104 develops a fermi edge , and the _ two _ pseudo fermi surfaces for the @xmath9-electrons at @xmath180 and @xmath181 shift as expected for free , nonhybridizing @xmath9-electrons . in the doped case ,",
    "the flat low intensity band which skims below @xmath165 and crosses @xmath165 at @xmath182 can be identified particularly well .",
    "also the heavy part in the inverse photoemission at @xmath183 and @xmath167 which is predicted by the theory can be identified reasonably well .",
    "again , the theoretical spectra somewhat overestimate the spectral weight of these heavy band portions , and the relative position of the lower hubbard band is not correct .",
    "our simple picture of the fermiology , however , obviously remains valid also with this more complicated fermi surface topology .",
    "+ we proceed to the case of non - vanishing @xmath10 , i.e. a coulomb repulsion between @xmath0 and conduction electrons .",
    "the lanczos spectra for this case are shown in figure [ fig10 ] , the theoretical spectra in figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "the main effects of @xmath10 is to open a wider gap at half - filling , to enhance the weight of the heavy bands and to shift the hubbard - bands to higher energy .",
    "all in all , the total width of the spectrum is now @xmath184 rather than @xmath169 as it used to be in the preceding cases . as compared to the preceding cases ,",
    "the hubbard bands moreover acquire an appreciable dispersion , and doping causes a pronounced spectral weight transfer from the upper to the lower hubbard band .",
    "the widening of the gap at half - filling appears hard to understand at first sight , because @xmath10 by itself does not increase the energy cost for a charge fluctuation : transferring a @xmath9-electron from one cell to another ( see the process figure [ fig1]a @xmath185 [ fig1]b ) does not change the energy due to @xmath0-@xmath9 repulsion as long as the @xmath0-occupation is nearly constant at @xmath23 ( which is almost certainly the case for the large @xmath170 we are using ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see , however , that the opening of the gap is due to a loss of _ kinetic energy _ :",
    "switching on @xmath10 increases the energy of the state @xmath186 by @xmath10 , so that the energy difference relative to the other two basis states is decreased by this amount ( see the hamilton matrix ( [ egs2 ] ) ) .",
    "this means that charge fluctuations in the two - electron ground state are enhanced , whence the kinetic energy for this state becomes more negative . on the other hand , this mechanism for enhancing the charge fluctuations is operative neither for one nor for three electrons in a cell ( see the respective hamilton matrices ( [ h1e ] )    = 8.1 cm    and ( [ h3e ] ) , so that there is no gain in kinetic energy in these cases .",
    "the charge fluctuation thus is accompanied by a net loss of kinetic energy , which in turn results in a larger charge gap .",
    "moreover , it follows from the expression ( [ nksc ] ) for the @xmath9-type spectral weight of the lower hybridization band that the distance in @xmath92-space over which the weight drops is approximately given by @xmath187 , with @xmath188 the charge gap and @xmath189 the fermi velocity .",
    "it is thus immediately obvious that an increase of the charge gap ( for whatever reason ) will give a ` more homogeneous ' @xmath9-weight along the hybridization bands .",
    "while at half - filling the agreement between lanczos and theoretical    = 8.1 cm    = 8.1 cm    spectra is very good , the situation changes for the doped case .",
    "the lower of the two hybridization bands is still well described , but the weights and dispersions of the other bands , as well as the weight shift between the hubbard bands are not reproduced well . actually the lanczos spectra show a rather strong reduction of the gap between the two central bands upon doping - we believe that this indicates a rather profound doping - induced reconstruction of the electronic structure and since our theory corresponds more or less to an ` expansion around the kondo insulator ' it may not be expected to reproduce this .",
    "+    = 8.1 cm    the situation is actually quite similar if we introduce a coulomb repulsion between conduction electrons@xcite , @xmath11 , see figure [ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] .",
    "again , this opens a wider quasiparticle gap in the spectrum and the hybridization bands now have a predominant @xmath9-character over their entire width .",
    "at half - filling the upper hybridization band intersects and mixes with the upper hubbard band for the @xmath0-electrons .",
    "the upper and lower hubbard band for the @xmath0-electrons remain unaffected and are dispersionless , the lower one has practically pure @xmath0-like character . at half - filling ,",
    "there is again good agreement between lanczos and theory but for the doped case the situation is again different . the lanczos spectra show a rather dramatic collapse of the gap between the hybridization bands , the upper hybridization band , which intersected the upper hubbard band at half - filling is now at least @xmath190 below .",
    "again , this suggests a strong doping induced reconstruction of the entire electronic structure , and our theory naturally fails to reproduce this .",
    "+ the effect of @xmath11 at half - filling can be understood already in the context of the strong coupling model limit , where we simply would have to replace @xmath191 .",
    "the more homogeneous @xmath9-character of the hybridization bands then follows in an analogous fashion as for @xmath10 . + as a last example , we turn to a somewhat exotic version of the kondo lattice model , where the magnitude of the @xmath9-@xmath0 hybridization depends on the occupation of the @xmath0-level . more precisely , we replace @xmath192 with @xmath193",
    ". such a model may be relevant@xcite to describe the recently discovered@xcite transition metal hydrides with switchable mirror properties , such as yh@xmath194 . in this case",
    ", the yttrium @xmath195 electrons would play the role of the conduction electrons , the hydrogen corresponds to the @xmath0-electrons .",
    "the conditional hopping term is supposed to describe the relaxation of the orbital wave function on hydrogen as a function of electron occupation@xcite .",
    "this is manifested e.g. by the dramatically larger radius of the free @xmath196 ion as compared to the neutral free @xmath66 atom ( for a detailed discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite , for a discussion of such an ` orbital kondo effect ' in the context of cuprate superconductors see refs.@xcite ) . here",
    "we are not so much interested in the details of the correspondence with yh@xmath194 , but rather in the applicability of our theory to this model .",
    "the conditional hopping is easily incorporated by replacing the hamiltonian ( [ egs2 ] ) for two electrons in a cell by @xmath197 and analogous replacements in the single and three - electron subspaces .",
    "it is quite obvious , that the conditional hopping will lead to a dramatic increase of the    = 8.1 cm    charge gap : in our picture , the magnitude of the gap is determined by the energy difference between two cells with @xmath24 electrons on one hand , and a cell with @xmath23 and one with @xmath25 electrons on the other hand .",
    "then , the electron in the singly occupied cell can mix with the conduction band only by using the ( much smaller ) hybridization integral @xmath198 , which corresponds to the collapsed @xmath0 orbital . only the single hole in the cell occupied by @xmath25 electrons",
    "can delocalize using the large hopping integral @xmath199 . a charge fluctuation",
    "thus will result in a huge loss of _ kinetic energy _ and thus open a substantial gap in the band structure    = 8.1 cm    ( the effect is thus similar , but much stronger than the @xmath10 discussed above ) .",
    "this gap will be opened even in the complete absence of any coulomb repulsion on the @xmath0-orbital , so that the breathing @xmath0-orbital can lead to strong correlation - like behaviour even if there is no really strong coulomb repulsion at play .",
    "in fact , comparing the lanczos and theoretial results ( figures [ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] ) one can note first of all a good agreement between the two , and in addition a very substantial correlation gap in the spectrum . also , there are low - intensity ` hubbard bands ' , whose position and spectral weight are reproduced quite well by the theory",
    ". an interesting feature in the lanczos data is the extra @xmath0-like band in the inverse photoemission spectrum which disperses from just above @xmath165 at @xmath200@xmath6@xmath178 to @xmath201 above @xmath165 at @xmath200@xmath6@xmath20 , and which is completely absent in the theory .",
    "we believe that this band is a consequence of superconducting pairing correlations in the doped ground state .",
    "as discussed by various workers , the breathing @xmath0-orbital presents a very strong pairing mechanism@xcite for electrons in the doped material , in that the electrons will always pair up around one @xmath0-site to hybridize by the large hopping parameter @xmath199 . in the spectral function the presence of such pairing correlations , will manifest itself as a bogoliubov - type ` mirror image ' of the topmost band , i.e. the replacement @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the ` nonsuperconducting dispersion ' of the lower hybridization band ( which should correspond to the one given by our theory ) and @xmath204 the superconducting gap .",
    "the latter appears to be quite small in the numerical spectra .",
    "we defer a detailed discussion of superconductivity to a separate publication , but we note that our theory does not encompass superconductivity , so that the absence of this band in the theroretical spectra can be no surprise . + summarizing this section , our theory gives a remarkably good description of sometimes rather complicated and unexpected features of a wide variety of extended versions of the kondo lattice .",
    "moreover , it allows in all cases to extract simple physical pictures in order to understand the overall trends .",
    "the main inaccuracy concerned the positions of the @xmath0-like hubbard bands , but we believe that this is not a severe deficiency because this is an extreme high - energy feature . in the cases of extra intra - cell repulsions",
    "the lanczos spectra showed some indications of a doping induced reconstruction of the electronic structure - this could not be reproduced by our theory . also , superconductivity in the doped ` breathing @xmath0 model ' naturally could not be described .",
    "in summary , we have presented a ` nearly analytical ' theory for the kondo lattice . in simplest terms",
    "it may be viewed as a fermionic version of linear spin wave theory , in that we constructed an effective hamiltonian describing the pair creation and propagation of fermionic charge fluctuations on a strong coupling rvb - type vaccuum .",
    "this gives us a systematic way to broaden the ionization and affinity states of a single cell into bands , reminiscent of the cell perturbation theory developed by jefferson and co - workers@xcite .",
    "for quite a number of different versions of the kondo - lattice model , the theoretical results for the single particle spectral function were found to be in overall excellent agreement with exact diagonalization of small clusters , as far as the dispersion of energy and spectral weight is concerened . as a",
    "particularly encouraging fact the rather nontrivial evolution of the spectra with electron density in many cases is reproduced in detail .",
    "this gives us some confidence that despite some uncontrolled approximations the theory is already very close to the correct picture .",
    "given its extraordinary simplicity ( all results are obtained by an elementary bogoliubov transformation ) we believe that the theory easily should be amenable to systematic improvement to describe as yet neglected processes . + the emerging picture of the kondo insulator then is quite different from that of a conventional band insulator , and in fact more reminiscent of a superconductor : the ground state at half - filling corresponds to an array of ( overlapping ) local singlets , where each kondo - spin forms a bound state with one conduction electron .",
    "the system has a single particle gap for precisely the same reason as in a superconductor : removing a conduction electron from some site @xmath4 and reinserting it at a remote site @xmath47 breaks two @xmath0-@xmath9 pairs , whence there is an increase in energy of twice the binding energy of a single pair .",
    "+ the basic idea of the present work therefore is not restricted to the kondo lattice .",
    "rather , once such an ` rvb - vacuum ' has been identified , an essentially analogous construction can be carried out also for other strongly correlated systems .",
    "the most obvious example is the doped @xmath205 ladder , where the ` rung singlet rvb state ' may replace the product of single cell states , and for which a very similar construction can indeed been carried out@xcite .",
    "+ perhaps the most important approximation we made is the neglect of any excited states of two electrons in a cell .",
    "this means that we have negelected single - cell states where one conduction electron and one @xmath0-electron couple to a triplet .",
    "such states do in fact have a very small excitation energy @xmath206 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this restriction forbids the propagating charge fluctuations to ` radiate off ' triplet - like spin excitations and thus makes their propagation completely coherent . the good agreement with the numerics , and also the relatively ` coherent ' nature of the lanczos",
    "spectra themselves ( in which the incoherent high - energy continua familiar from the @xmath205 or hubbard model@xcite are almost completely absent ) , give us some confidence that despite their low energy , the neglect of the singlet triplet excitations is a good approximation as far as the single particle properties are concerned .",
    "moreover , it is quite easy to incorporate these singlet - triplet excitations into the present theory@xcite : the three components of a triplet state in cell @xmath4 can be grouped into an so(3 ) vector @xmath207 .",
    "then , we would model the cell @xmath4 being in the @xmath208 triplet state by the presence of a _ bosonic _ excitation , created by @xmath209 .",
    "in addition to a term describing the on - site energies of these triplet we would obtain terms which describe the coupling between the fermionic charge fluctuations and the bosonic spin fluctuations .",
    "their form can be inferred from rotational invariance : for example @xmath210 ( with @xmath211 the vector of pauli matrices ) describes the hopping of a hole from @xmath212 while creating a spin excitation in cell @xmath4 ; the terms @xmath213 and @xmath214 represent two different ways for a spin excitation to exchange its position with a hole .",
    "the actual prefactors of these terms can be computed in an entirely analogous fashion as the hopping integrals for the charge fluctuations themselves , and these terms can be incorporated into the formalism by using standard green s function techniques .",
    "details will be reported elsewhere@xcite . since already",
    "the simplest version of the theory apparently gives a quite good description of the physics , one may expect that such an extension is actually ` convergent ' and gives a good description of the spin dynamics as well .",
    "+ as a final remark , we note that the ` vaccum ' in the case of the simple kondo lattice was a unique product of singlet states , and that the charge fluctuations did have precisely the quantum numbers of electrons or holes . for systems with a larger unit cell , however , one can envisage situations where this is very different : one example would be a @xmath24-fold orbitally degenerate @xmath0-level mixing with a nondegenerate @xmath9-orbital . for one electron / orbital the number of electrons / unit cell",
    "then would be @xmath25 , and the ( fermionic ) charge fluctuations would correspond to cells with an even number of electrons . thereby hund s rule coupling between the degenerate @xmath0-orbitals would favour high - spin states , so that one might actually obtain ` high - spin quasiparticles ' .",
    "form the good success for the simple kondo lattice one might expect that the present formalism would continue to give a good description even in this more complicated situation .",
