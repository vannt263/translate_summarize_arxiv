    "the smallness of light neutrino masses , compared to the other fermions , suggests that new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is involved in their generation .",
    "the simplest and most popular explanation for neutrino mass suppression is provided by the seesaw mechanism  @xcite , which introduces heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "these new states need not to be at the tev scale , nor they are necessarily at the direct reach of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "nevertheless , this is an interesting possibility which has motivated much effort both from the theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite sides .",
    "it is well known that the heavy neutrinos may enhance the rates of lepton flavor - violating processes such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 conversion ( see  @xcite for reviews ) . in this sense ,",
    "precision measurements in the intensity frontier constitute a complementary window to testing the seesaw mechanism .",
    "notably , the interplay between the high - energy and high - intensity probes of the seesaw requires the direct measurement of the heavy neutrino couplings at the lhc . in this work",
    "we investigate how these couplings could be measured in case a heavy neutrino signal is observed .    as a benchmark scenario ,",
    "we consider heavy neutrino production in the context of left - right symmetric models  @xcite , for which the lhc reach is very good  @xcite . in these scenarios ,",
    "heavy neutrinos can be produced from the decay of an su(2)@xmath4 gauge boson @xmath5 , @xmath6 and they subsequently decay through an off - shell @xmath5 as @xmath7 giving a @xmath8 signal , where @xmath9 ( with the same or opposite charges , due to the majorana nature of @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 are light jets . until now",
    ", almost all studies  @xcite dedicated to the study of heavy neutrino signals in left - right models have been concentrated on the simplest case where @xmath12 , ignoring the production of @xmath13 leptons .",
    "however , current experimental searches are sensitive to the @xmath13 s  @xcite through the detection of secondary leptons produced in the leptonic decays @xmath14 .",
    "we stress that , from the theoretical point of view , there is no compelling argument in favor of zero @xmath15 mixing . actually , bearing in mind the lepton mixing pattern revealed by neutrino oscillation experiments , one could easily find a motivation against that assumption . in view of this , an analysis including the @xmath13-induced dilepton final states is most welcome .    in this paper",
    "we will assume that a @xmath8 heavy neutrino signal is seen at the lhc .",
    "after determining the @xmath5 and heavy neutrino masses , which is quite straightforward from the observed resonance peaks , the next step would be to measure the couplings of the heavy neutrino to the charged leptons and the @xmath5 boson .",
    "this interaction is parametrized by the lagrangian @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the @xmath19 gauge coupling and @xmath20 mixing parameters , respectively .",
    "the latter obey the general normalization condition @xmath21 with @xmath22 constrained to be very close to unity . for simplicity ,",
    "in this work we consider that only one heavy neutrino @xmath10 is lighter than the @xmath5 boson . in case",
    "there is more than one , the method presented here can be extended by applying suitable kinematical cuts to single out each heavy neutrino contribution .",
    "let us now discuss in some detail how the mixings can be extracted from event counting in dilepton final states , without assuming unitarity of the leptonic mixings , i.e. @xmath23 . the cross section for the process in eq .",
    "( [ ec : prod ] ) with a given lepton @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cross section for @xmath5 production and @xmath27 is the ratio between the hadronic and leptonic @xmath5 decay widths for @xmath28 ( this quantity is independent of lepton mixings ) . the total cross section for @xmath10 production is then @xmath29 which , together with the branching ratio for the decay in eq .  (",
    "[ ec : dec ] ) , @xmath30 leads to the cross section for the production of charged leptons @xmath24 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 by introducing the normalized mixings @xmath33 we find the expected result @xmath34 i.e. , the total heavy neutrino cross section is distributed among the different dilepton flavors according to the squares of the normalized mixings .",
    "the above equation also reflects the fact that one can not simultaneously measure the total cross section and test the unitarity of the mixings from @xmath35 alone .",
    "however , if the gauge coupling @xmath17 could be determined from other processes ( for example , in the decay channel @xmath36 ) and a definite prediction for @xmath26 and @xmath37 could be made , then the unitarity of leptonic mixing would be testable by inverting eq .",
    "( [ ec : sigmatot ] ) , @xmath38    we now address the question on how the individual cross sections @xmath35 ( and , thus , the mixing parameters ) can be extracted from the data .",
    "we restrict ourselves to final - state signatures with two electrons or muons , which can result from prompt production @xmath12 or from the leptonic decay of @xmath39 .",
    "notice that with the tagging of hadronic @xmath13 decays the final state of one electron or muon plus a @xmath13-jet could be used as well , improving the results presented here . in a previous work",
    "@xcite , it has been emphasized that the key for the sensitivity to @xmath39 in the dilepton final state is to drop any requirement on the missing energy of the events , @xmath40 , which is small ( and caused by instrumental effects ) for @xmath12 but large when there is one or more @xmath13 leptons .",
    "however , this is not enough to obtain precise measurements of the mixings and , therefore , a separation of the dilepton samples according to @xmath40 is necessary .",
    "this fact , which will be confirmed later by our numerical results , can be easily understood with the following simple semi - quantitative argument .",
    "let us assume the same efficiency @xmath41 for electron and muon detection . at high transverse momenta ,",
    "as it corresponds to the production of a heavy @xmath5 , the efficiency for secondary leptons originated from @xmath13 decays is similar  @xcite , but these are penalized by the branching ratio @xmath42 .",
    "then , for an integrated luminosity @xmath43 the number of events in each dilepton channel is @xmath44 \\ , , \\notag \\\\",
    "n_{\\mu\\mu } & = & \\sigma_\\text{tot } l \\varepsilon \\left ( |v_{\\mu n}^r|^4 + 2 \\eta |v_{\\mu n}^r|^2 |v_{\\tau n}^r|^2 + \\eta^2 |v_{\\tau n}^r|^4   \\right ) \\ , .",
    "\\label{ec : deg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although there are three independent parameters ( for example , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) and three measurements , it is clear that very distinct parameter space points can give roughly the same numbers of events in the three channels . is implicitly assumed . ] in particular , along the line @xmath48 one has @xmath49 , and the system of equations is underconstrained .",
    "for instance , the cases of maximal @xmath50 and @xmath51 mixing with @xmath52 @xmath53 and the one with @xmath13 mixing only and @xmath54 , @xmath55 lead to the same number of events .",
    "the obvious difference between these two cases is that , in the latter , the events have large missing energy due to the neutrinos produced in @xmath13 decays .",
    "then , the solution to the degeneracy is to separate the dilepton samples in ` low @xmath40 ' and ` high @xmath40 ' events , according to some convenient threshold .",
    "this distinction doubles the number of measurements and definitely resolves the aforementioned ambiguities , which are otherwise present when event counting is performed on the @xmath40-inclusive samples .",
    "in order to test the above method in the extraction of heavy neutrino mixings , we rely on a fast simulation analysis of heavy neutrino signals and corresponding sm backgrounds at the lhc , with a center of mass energy of 14 tev .",
    "a luminosity of 30 fb@xmath56 is assumed . signal events are generated with triada  @xcite and backgrounds with alpgen  @xcite .",
    "the hadronization is performed by pythia  @xcite , and acerdet  @xcite is used for a fast simulation of a generic lhc detector . for the suppression of the sm backgrounds we apply an event selection similar to the one used by the atlas collaboration for 7 tev searches  @xcite , but tightening some of the kinematical cuts .",
    "namely , we require :    * exactly two leptons with transverse momentum @xmath57 gev , and pseudo - rapidity @xmath58 for electrons , @xmath59 for muons .",
    "electrons in the range @xmath60 are excluded . * at least one jet with @xmath61 gev and @xmath62 .",
    "* dilepton invariant mass @xmath63 gev . *",
    "the sum of transverse momenta of the two leptons and highest @xmath64 jets ( including up to two jets ) must be larger than 700 gev .",
    "* the @xmath5 reconstructed mass must be larger than 700 gev . for events with at least two jets ,",
    "this mass is defined as the invariant mass of the two leptons and the two leading jets , @xmath65 . for events with only one jet ,",
    "it includes only this jet , @xmath66 .",
    "we split our dilepton final state events in twelve disjoint sets .",
    "first , those with same - sign leptons are separated from the ones with opposite - sign .",
    "this turns out to be convenient since the former have a much lower sm background .",
    "second , each one of those two sets is divided in two subsets with @xmath67 gev and @xmath68 gev , corresponding to ` low ' and ` high ' @xmath40 .",
    "finally , the events are classified according to the lepton flavour .",
    "the sm background @xmath69 for each final state generically labelled as @xmath70 is given in table  [ tab : bkg ] for a luminosity @xmath71 .",
    "it includes @xmath72 , single top , @xmath73 @xmath74 jets , @xmath75 @xmath74 jets , @xmath76 @xmath74 jets , @xmath77 @xmath74 jets , diboson and triboson production .",
    "further details about the background generation can be found in  @xcite .",
    ".sm background @xmath69 for the twelve dilepton final states @xmath70 and for a luminosity of 30 fb@xmath56 [ tab : bkg ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     c +   +    c +   +    then , we extract the signal cross section and the heavy neutrino mixing parameters from the pseudo - data by minimizing the quantity @xmath78 where @xmath79 is fixed for each benchmark point , and @xmath80 the above quantity is a function of the two independent flavour mixing parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 and the total cross section @xmath83 ( we use the hat notation to distinguish the fitted values from the ` true ' ones used to generate the pseudo - data sample ) .",
    "the inclusion of systematic uncertainties is not essential for our analysis , which is more focused on the method to extract heavy neutrino mixings from data , rather than on the precise value of the limits obtained . in any case , the statistics are moderate for the two mass points considered and , therefore , we do not expect a dramatic change of the results presented here when systematic uncertainties are properly accounted for .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim1 ] we present our results for the two mass benchmark points considered .",
    "the upper plot shows the limits on the two independent normalized mixings @xmath84 and @xmath46 .",
    "the white dots correspond to the input values used in the pseudo - experiments ( see table  [ tab : mix ] ) and the solid regions are the 68.3% confidence level ( cl ) limits on the two independent normalized mixings @xmath84 and @xmath46 extracted from the pseudo - experiments , as discussed above . notice that the normalized mixings satisfy @xmath85 by definition , so the region outside the _ unitary _ red arc is not allowed .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the 68.3% cl limits that would be obtained without splitting the dilepton samples into ` low ' and ` high ' @xmath40 ( for each mixing benchmark point , the pair of outer lines corresponds to @xmath86 tev and the inner lines to @xmath87  tev ) . in most cases , the degeneracy that we have discussed qualitatively in eqs .",
    "( [ ec : deg ] ) is manifest .",
    "the only exception occur for points a ( g ) where the absence of electrons ( muons ) in the signal implies a mixing with the muon ( electron ) close to maximal .",
    "the lower plot presents the same benchmark points and resulting limits but viewed in the @xmath88 plane .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim2 ] we repeat the analysis for the same benchmark points assuming that the measured value of @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath89 and equals the theoretical value presented before for each mass point .",
    "the absolute mixings @xmath90 equal the normalized ones ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim1 ] ) multiplied by @xmath22 , which is obtained from the fitted cross section @xmath83 and eq .",
    "( [ ec : kappa2 ] ) . as in the previous case ,",
    "the allowed regions for the mixings at 68.3@xmath91 cl are shown in the @xmath92 and @xmath93 planes ( top and middle plots , respectively ) .",
    "the corresponding limits for the parameter @xmath22 are given in the lower panel ( color codes are the same as in fig .  [",
    "fig : lim1 ] ) .",
    "we observe that , provided the statistics are good and the systematic uncertainties for the total cross sections ( which we have ignored ) are controlled at the @xmath94 level or better , the unitarity of the mixings can also be tested .",
    "in case new physics is discovered at the lhc , it will be essential to determine its properties . here",
    ", we have addressed one particular example that represents a variety of new physics models related to neutrino mass generation : the production of heavy neutrinos in the context of a left - right symmetric model .",
    "we have investigated the determination of the couplings of a heavy neutrino @xmath10 to the charged leptons , showing that an inclusive event counting is not sufficient for this purpose .",
    "basically , this happens because the electrons and muons in the final state can be produced promptly in the @xmath10 decays , or from secondary decays of @xmath13 leptons produced in the decays of the heavy neutrinos .",
    "we have pointed out that one possible solution for this degeneracy is to discriminate the dilepton events based on the missing energy , so that prompt electrons and muons can be distinguished from the secondary ones .    obviously , this kind of degeneracy is not a specific feature of this model , but a generic one in any sm extension with new particles coupling to the charged leptons .",
    "the most immediate example is type - i seesaw without left - right symmetry , in @xmath95 although in this case observing the signal is very demanding  @xcite , let alone measuring the heavy neutrino couplings .",
    "more interesting is the production of heavy neutrino pairs via a new @xmath96 boson  @xcite , @xmath97 similarly , in type - iii seesaw one has dilepton signals resulting from the production of the new heavy leptons @xmath98 @xmath99 in all these cases , the procedure presented here can be straightforwardly applied to determine the couplings of the heavy leptons . in case",
    "more than one heavy neutrino is produced at the lhc , the method presented here can be generalized by introducing appropriate kinematical cuts to single out the contribution of each heavy neutrino .",
    "the practical implementation of this sophistication ( which would be necessary if several heavy neutrinos were discovered ) strongly depends on the particular values of the heavy neutrino masses , and falls beyond the scope of this work .",
