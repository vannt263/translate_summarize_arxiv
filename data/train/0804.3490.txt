    "the self energy correction comes about from non - perturbative binding corrections inside the meson .",

    "the `` yukawa '' part of the @xmath126 interaction from the abelian - like field - strength correlator is relevant .",
    "it is important that the purely phenomenological parameters do not vary much for both light and heavy systems .",
    "our variational calculations are based on trial wave functions which factorize .",
    "this is not necessary . extending the set of basis functions we found a small variation of the mean transverse momentum with the longitudinal momentum .",
    "further work is needed to find out theoretically the spin - spin interaction and the wave function renormalization .",
    "the framework of the light cone hamiltonian proposed here has to be seen in context with the successful parametrization of high - energy hadron - hadron scattering based on the same gluon - field strength correlation functions ref .",

    ", the dipole approach uses only phenomenological light cone wave functions for the asymptotic hadronic states .",
    "the propagation of a color dipole in the nucleus demands a dynamical treatment @xcite .",
    "the dipole propagates with an imaginary potential due its inelastic scatterings and with a real potential which confines the quarks on their way through the nucleus .",
    "its greens - function determines the shadowing of nuclear structure functions or heavy quark production in nuclei .",
    "our approach may help to formulate this problem consistently . with this work ,",
