    "there are many compelling reasons to believe that nature is supersymmetric at short distances .",
    "since the observed spectrum of fermions and gauge bosons does not exhibit any trace of supersymmetry , it must be broken at a scale around or higher than 100 gev .",
    "the general procedure followed in building realistic models with broken supersymmetry is to assume that supersymmetry breaking takes place in a hidden sector which is completely separate from the visible sector of the standard model and have this effect transmitted to the quarks and leptons via a messenger sector .",
    "different classes of supersymmetric models can be distinguished by the way the messengers transmit supersymmetry breaking from the hidden sector to the visible one .",
    "a scenario which has become very popular in the last two years is one where the messenger fields are replicas of the known quarks and leptons except that they are heavier and they come in vector like pairs@xcite and the standard model gauge interactions of the messenger fields are the ones that transmit supersymmetry breaking to the visible sector .",
    "the advantage of these models is that they lead to degenerate squark and slepton masses at the scale @xmath2 which then provides a natural solution to the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) problem of the low energy supersymmetry models .",
    "this makes the models phenomenologically very attractive .",
    "secondly these models are extremely predictive@xcite so that one can have a genuine hope that they can be experimentally tested in the not too distant future .",
    "there are however several drawbacks of these models : ( i ) one needs to put in extra vectorlike quarks and leptons whose sole purpose is to transmit the supersymmetry breaking from the hidden to the visible sector ; ( ii ) it has been argued@xcite that in explicit models of supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector , the lowest vacuum breaks color and only the false vacuum has the desirable properties ; ( iii ) the lightest of the messenger fields is a heavy stable particle which may lead to cosmological difficulties .",
    "moreover , in these models there is no apriori reason why the vector - like quarks can not mix with the known quarks .",
    "if they do mix , then additional tree level fcnc effects can spoil the above naturalness property .",
    "finally , these models do not address some other generic problems of the mssm such as the existence of r - parity breaking interactions that lead to arbitrary couplings for the unwanted baryon and lepton number violating couplings .",
    "since the general idea of the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking is attractive , it would be useful to explore models that avoid its undesirable features while at the same time maintaining the good ones ( such as the non degeneracy of squark and slepton fields ) . with this goal in mind , two of us ( s.n . and r.n.m .",
    ") began exploring a new class of models@xcite where the messenger sector consists of different fields .",
    "we also chose the electroweak gauge group to be @xmath0@xcite so that it guarantees automatic r - parity conservation@xcite .",
    "it then turns out that the messenger fields can also play the role of higgs fields that can serve to break the above gauge group down to the standard model group .",
    "thus the scale of supersymmetry breaking gets connected to the scale of gauge symmetry breaking and the breaking of electroweak symmetry remains radiative .",
    "this is a very minimal extension of the standard model which also leads to nonzero neutrino masses via the usual see - saw mechanism@xcite .",
    "moreover , since the messenger fields couple to the right - handed neutrinos in order to implement the see - saw mechanism , they are unstable and therefore do not cause any cosmological problem .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to study a wider class of models which follow the spirit of this idea but use different messenger fields .",
    "we study the following different messenger sectors : ( the numbers in the parenthesis denote the @xmath0 quantum numbers ) ( ai ) the minimal one of ref.@xcite which uses only fields @xmath3 ; ( aii ) one pair of @xmath4 along with two extra higgs doublets @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; ( aiii ) model ( aii ) with the addition of a pair of color octets ( electroweak singlet ) @xmath7 .",
    "we also extend the gauge group to the left - right symmetric @xmath8 case .",
    "we impose the requirement of electroweak symmetry breaking to be radiative and study the detailed predictions for the sparticle spectra for these models and outline the phenomenological implications .",
    "we find that the present experimental data seem to allow only the third model for both the gauge groups .",
    "once the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking is relaxed , all the cases become viable .",
    "we present typical particle spectra for each of these cases .",
    "they turn out to be very different from the conventional gmsb models making it possible to test the general idea of the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking as opposed to a specific messenger version of it .",
    "a distinct and testable prediction of our models is that the lightest neutralino is always the nlsp leading to photonic events in the colliders .",
    "we arrange this paper as follows : in section ii , we outline the model and present the mass formulae for the various sparticles at the scale @xmath2 of supersymmetry breaking ; in section iii , we present the particle spectra for these models and we discuss the phenomenological implications and tests of the models .",
    "section iv contains the minimization of the higgs potential for one typical version of these models and in section v , we present some concluding remarks .",
    "* a : models with @xmath9 *    we begin our discussion with a brief recap of the model of ref.@xcite which we call model ai .",
    "the electroweak gauge group is @xmath10 with quarks and leptons ( including the right - handed neutrinos , @xmath11 ) transforming as follows : @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ; @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ; @xmath17 .",
    "the two mssm higgs doublet superfields transform as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to these , we add the fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( three such pairs ) that break the @xmath22 symmetry down to the @xmath23 of the standard model .",
    "they have the quantum numbers @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the superpotential for the matter sector of the theory ( denoted @xmath26 is given by :    @xmath27    this is common to all versions of the type a models .",
    "the different cases arise from the different choices of the messenger sector .",
    "_ model ai _    the messenger sector in this case consists of three pairs of fields @xmath28 and @xmath21 mentioned above .",
    "the messenger sector superpotential @xmath29 ( representing only a part of the complete superpotential ) is given by @xmath30 we will show in section .",
    "v that the @xmath31 , @xmath28 and @xmath21 acquire nonzero vacuum expectation values ( vev ) so that supersymmetry as well as @xmath32 are broken at the same scale . as a result",
    ", the supersymmetry breaking scale and the @xmath33 breaking scale get linked to each other and can not be arbitrarily adjusted in the physics discussion .",
    "next , we note that the supersymmetry breaking is transmitted from the hidden sector to the visible sector via the @xmath33 and @xmath34 gauge interactions . as a result , it is the exchange of @xmath33 and @xmath34 gauge particles that replaces the standard model ( and mssm ) particles in the gmsb model graphs that give a majorana mass to the gauginos at the one loop and sfermions at the two loop level .",
    "the resulting majorana mass of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 gauginos ( @xmath35 ) is such that the bino @xmath36 remains massless . in other words , in the language of the mssm , @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath38 gauginos also do not have any majorana mass ( i.e. @xmath39 ) .",
    "the gluino is also massless in this model as was already noted in @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that there are tiny contributions to all gaugino masses in this model at the electroweak scale .",
    "for instance , gluino masses arise from the diagram in fig .",
    "1 and can be estimated to be @xmath40 leading to a mass of the order of a gev or less .",
    "the same holds for all the models discussed here .",
    "this loop induced mass becomes important if there are no other larger contribution in the model and leads to the light gluino scenario advocated in recent literature@xcite .",
    "these , as we will see , have profound implications for phenomenology .",

    "it is therefore clear that the good fcnc properties of the usual gmsb are maintained in this class of models .",
    "furthermore the spectrum of squarks and sleptons here is very different from that of the usual gmsb models , where messenger fields carry color .",
    "for example , the sleptons are heavier than the squarks . in section iii",
    ", we present the predictions for the various sfermion masses in this model .",
    "_ model aii _",
    "the second class of models with the same gauge group , we consider , is characterized by the following higgs content that changes the character of the messenger sector .",
    "in addition to one pair of @xmath28 fields as in model @xmath49 , we include two pairs of @xmath50 higgs doublets @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( with a=1,2 ) .",
    "the standard model higgs doublets will arise out of these higgs fields and below the susy breaking scale there are only light doublets .",
    "we will assume that the second pair ( a=2 ) does not couple to the quarks and leptons .",
    "we will show in section v that the minimization of the higgs potential will lead to vev s for the @xmath28 fields which will induce supersymmetry breaking @xmath53 .",
    "the relevant part of the hidden sector superpotential @xmath29 has the form @xmath54 the @xmath55 and @xmath56 will play the role of messenger fields .",
    "it is then clear that now @xmath57 are nonzero removing a major constraint in the phenomenological analysis .",
    "the gluino is however still massless .",
    "the masses @xmath58 with @xmath59 denoting the @xmath60 and @xmath61 gauge groups are given by : @xmath62 as far as the other sfermion masses go , we give the relevant formulae below : @xmath63 where @xmath64    _ model aiii _    the last class of models we will consider will have some messengers with color so that the gluinos can pick up mass .",
    "we do not consider colored fields with quantum numbers identical with the quarks as in the usual gmsb models since they could mix with the known quarks and generate new undesirable fcnc effects .",
    "as an example we will consider a pair of color octet fields along with two pairs of higgs doublets as in aii . we will show in sec .",

    "b : models with @xmath68 gauge group *    let us now turn to the models with the left - right symmetric gauge group .",
    "the quarks and leptons transform under the gauge group as : @xmath69 ; @xmath70 ; @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we implement the breaking of @xmath73 symmetry by means of the triplet higgs pair as in the usual left - right models@xcite .",
    "the messenger sectors will essentially be the same as in case ( a ) except that the doublet pairs everywhere will now be replaced by bi - doublets @xmath74 .",
    "we will assume that the spectrum below the scale @xmath46 is same as in mssm ; this will require that we enforce a doublet - doublet splitting at that scale .",
    "one way to do this is to follow a recent suggestion@xcite where the parameters of the superpotential involving the bidoublets are finetuned .",
    "this fine tuning is essentially the same as the unresolved @xmath75 problem of the mssm and we do not have anything more to say on this question . in any case , as far as the contribution to the gaugino masses go , the @xmath76 will remain the same as before for the various cases , and the @xmath77 and @xmath78 are as follows : @xmath79 the left - chiral squark and slepton mass contributions remain the same as in the case _ a_. as far as the masses of @xmath80 , @xmath81 are concerned , in formula eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we now have @xmath82",
    "in this section , we discuss the sparticle spectroscopy of the type a models .",
    "the predictions for the type b models are same for the left - chiral sparticles but only slightly different for the right chiral ones .",
    "we therefore do not discuss the type b models in this section .",
    "in giving the numerical predictions for the sfermion masses in this model , we start by first requiring that the electroweak symmetry be radiatively broken .",
    "as is well - known this requires that : @xmath83 where all radiative corrections are absorbed into the parameters .",
    "the reasons why it is nontrivial to satisfy this equation in predictive models such as the gmsb models are the following : the higgs masses are predicted to be positive at the scale @xmath46 and to be proportional to various gauge couplings @xmath84 and @xmath46 and the renormalization group evolution of the higgs masses depends on the value of the stop masses at @xmath46 .",
    "so for instance , if in a model , the @xmath85 is too large and the stop masses are not large enough at that scale , @xmath86 will remain positive at @xmath87 and will not lead to electroweak symmetry breaking . in one of the models to be discussed",
    "later this is what happens . to see this in a qualitative manner ,",
    "let us write down the extrapolated value of the @xmath88 in the lowest order approximation ( neglecting running of squark masses and the effect of the gaugino masses ) .",
    "@xmath89    in the minimal model ( _ ai _ ) , it is clear from eq .",
    "( 13 ) that electroweak symmetry breaking depends on the relative values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the masses in the above eqn . are given by : @xmath92 it is clear from eq.(13 ) and eq.(14 ) that @xmath93 for @xmath94 , where @xmath95 .",
    "we find that for @xmath96 , the radiative symmetry breaking becomes possible and that we can satisfy the above ewsb equation for @xmath97 tev for reasonable values of the @xmath75 parameter .",
    "we should mention that this way of determining the allowed values of @xmath98 is very rough and we have determined @xmath98 numerically . in table 1 , we list the predictions for the various sparticle masses ( where we have numerically solved the renormalization group equations exactly in the one loop approximation ) for two different choices of the scale @xmath46 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and sign(@xmath75 ) .",
    "we emphasize that these are the only four inputs into the model and all other masses are predictions ( including the @xmath101 parameter , which is chosen to satisfy the ewsb constraint ) .",
    "a detailed study shows that this model predicts the light higgs mass to be in the range of 30 to 50 gev .",
    "the higgs production cross - section in @xmath102 collision is of course slightly lowered by the factor @xmath103@xcite .",
    "there are two important decay modes of the lightest higgs boson : @xmath104 and @xmath105 ; however , detailed study of the neutralino mass matrix in the allowed parameter space seems to give @xmath104 mode to be the dominant one .",
    "it is therefore hard to reconcile with the present lepii data .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath75 does not seem to be of any help , since it would decrease the chargino mass .",
    "the lightest neutralino in this model is primarily a combination of the gauginos and next to lightest neutralino is a combination of the higgsinos . the next to lightest neutralino is also very light ( less than 20 gev in the two illustrative scenarios given in the table1 ) .",
    "since these next to lightest neutralinos decay hadronically ( each neutralino would decay into a anti - quark , a quark and a gluino ) , they would contribute to the hadronic decay width of z. however the contribution to the z decay width is 7 - 15 mev for the scenarios in the table 1 and is allowed by the present data .",
    "the lighter chargino pair production cross - section in this model ( for the scenarios given in the table 1 ) is little higher @xmath106 pb for @xmath107=172 gev .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that a crucial assumption that leads to the above conclusions is that the electroweak symmetry breaking be radiative .",
    "if however , we give up that assumption and only assume that the supersymmetry breaking be transmitted via @xmath33 gauge interactions , then higgs and the chargino masses can become much higher and no such conflict with present data occurs .",
    "in such a model , electroweak symmetry breaking may , for example , arise from terms like @xmath108 in the superpotential .    turning to the model _ aii _ , we find that the model fails to give rise to electro - weak symmetry breaking .",
    "2 shows the extrapolation of the higgs masses from the scale @xmath46 down to the weak scale and the main feature to notice is that @xmath86 ( and of course @xmath109 ) remains positive .",
    "the main reason for this is the small value for the stop masses at the @xmath46 scale , since it is the stop mass that drives the up - type higgs mass negative in the renormalization group evolution .",
    "one can see this in a qualitative manner as follows .",
    "note that we have @xmath110 defining @xmath111 , we get @xmath112 where @xmath113 is roughly @xmath114 .",
    "the condition for the @xmath115 to turn negative at the weak scale is @xmath116 under the constraint @xmath117 . only for a very narrow range of values of @xmath118 , these two constraints are satisfied .",
    "we consider this to be extreme fine tuning .",
    "r is also large in that range which implies very large value of @xmath90 . outside this very narrow range",
    ", the typical value of @xmath115 is shown in fig.2 .",
    "let us now turn to the model _ aiii _ which includes the color octet messengers . in this model",
    "the stop masses at the scale @xmath46 are enhanced due to the octet contribution . as a result",
    ", the electro - weak symmetry breaking condition is satisfied more easily . in table 2",
    ", we give the prediction for the sparticle masses as well as the higgs masses for this model .",
    "the squark masses in this model are close to one tev and are higher than the prediction of the usual gmsb models .",
    "the chargino masses in this model are well allowed by the experimental data and due to the color octet contribution the gluino masses are @xmath119 tev .",
    "an important feature of this model is the prediction of a relatively light neutralino , @xmath120 in the mass range of 54 gev or less .",
    "@xmath120 decays to a photon and a gravitino .",
    "thus a production of this neutralino pair in electron positron collider will give rise to two photons plus missing energy in the final state .",
    "both the opal and the aleph collaboration at lepii have looked for this signal . from the non observation of this signal at @xmath121 gev ,",
    "they have established the following bounds : + opal collaboration : @xmath122 0.41 pb ( 95@xmath123c.l.)@xcite .",
    "+ aleph collaboration : @xmath122 0.18 pb@xcite .",
    "+ in fig ( 3a ) , we plot the cross - sections for @xmath124 as functions of the neutralino mass for the three lepii energies , @xmath107=172 , 182 , 194 gev .",
    "the cross - sections in our model is much lower than those in the usual gmsb model @xcite because of the larger mass of the lighter scalar electron .",
    "these curves are for @xmath1259 and @xmath1264 . with the increase of the value of @xmath98",
    ", the cross - sections gets smaller , whereas the dependence on @xmath127 is very small . as r increases , @xmath90 increases .",
    "we restrict to @xmath128 to keep @xmath90 in the perturbative region ( for r=6 , @xmath129 ) . in fig ( 3b ) , we show that the values of the cross - sections for @xmath130 and r=6 . in both fig ( 3a ) and ( 3b ) , @xmath131 has been varied from 40 to 60 gev ( the corresponding values for the squark masses lie between 0.9 to 1.5 tev ) .",
    "we do not increase @xmath131 any further in order to keep susy a viable explanation for the hierarchy problem . from figs",
    "( 3a ) and ( 3b ) , we see that the current lep ii bounds on the neutralino pair productions are satisfied .",
    "the important point is to note that the smallest allowed values of the cross - sections are not too much below the current experimental bounds .",
    "thus , the photon signals in our model could be within reach in the lepii experiments in very near future .",
    "now we discuss the consequences of this model at the tevatron collider ( @xmath132 tev ) . in table 2 , our lightest neutralino mass varies from 29 to 40 gev , while the lighter chargino mass varies from 94 to 126 gev . at tevatron",
    "these could be produced in the following processes : @xmath133 where @xmath134 run over 1,2 while @xmath135 run from @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "for the mass range given in table 2 , @xmath138 can be produced at tevatron with significant cross - section .",
    "the subsequent decays of the neutralino to a photon and a gravitino and the decay of a chargino to a @xmath139 or @xmath140 will give rise to inclusive @xmath141 missing @xmath142 final states .",
    "recently , the authors of ref.@xcite have studied these signals in great detail , including detector simulation .",
    "they conclude that with the assumption of gaugino unification , @xmath143 gev and @xmath144 gev can be excluded with @xmath145 of tevatron data ( such masses give rise to about 10 two photon events plus missing energy inclusive events ) . without the assumption of gaugino unification ( which is the case in our model ) ,",
    "they exclude @xmath146 gev for @xmath147 gev .",
    "( in this analysis , @xmath147 gev is needed for the photons and missing energy to satisfy the detector cut , @xmath148 gev , missing @xmath149 gev ) .",
    "thus the mass range presented in table 2 are not excluded by the current tevatron data , but in the interesting boundary of being tested with the complete analysis of the tevatron data and could be easily tested in the upgraded tevatron .",
    "another interesting feature of this model is that the lightest @xmath120 is always the nlsp .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the usual gmsb models , where the nlsp can be either the lightest neutralino or the lighter stau depending on the parameter space .",
    "in addition , in the usual gmsb models , @xmath120 need not be as light , whereas in our model as argued before , @xmath120 is in the 50 gev range or lighter because its mass is tied to the squark masses .",
    "the lighter chargino in our model can be around 130gev .",
    "each chargino decays into a w and a neutralino , where the neutralino decays @xmath150 into @xmath151 and gravitino and the w decays partly into a electron and a anti - neutrino .",
    "the final state has @xmath152 plus missing energy . for other decays of the @xmath153 boson ,",
    "we would in general have @xmath154 plus missing energy or @xmath155 plus missing energy or multijet + @xmath156 plus missing energy .",
    "such a signal with two hard photons will be easily detected and will have negligible sm background .",
    "the detailed predictions for this phenomenon at collider energies is presently under investigation and will be the subject of a forthcoming publication@xcite .    if two pairs of higgs doublets , instead of one , contribute to the squark and gaugino masses , then the lightest neutralino mass and the chargino mass become larger due to the larger values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 at the gauge mediated scale .",
    "the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 are larger by a factor of 4 than the previous case .",
    "the squark masses do not get affected much due to this new contribution , since the color octet has a bigger contribution .",
    "the slepton masses also become larger .",
    "we show some scenarios for this model in table 3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this case the squark masses can be lower than the previous model .",
    "this is because the lightest neutralino mass is heavier in this model which reduces the @xmath2 and subsequently reduces the squark masses . the pseudo scalar mass and",
    "the charged higgs mass can also be lower in this case due to the same reason .",
    "the superpartner masses in this case can be safely beyond the present lower limits .",
    "the mass spectrum for the models bi - biii are almost comparable to the model ai - aiii .",
    "in this section we address the question of the explicit model that leads to a vev for @xmath31 used in the previous section while at the same time allowing the appropriate messengers to transmit the supersymmetry breaking .",
    "this discussion is nontrivial for the following reasons . while it is easy to costruct a superpotential that leads to a singlet having a non - zero vev and a non - zero @xmath157 , it is not simple to communicate the supersymmetry breaking to the visible sector .",
    "for some of the problems see the paper by dasgupta et al@xcite . below we provide an explicit superpotential which enables us to attain all our goals simultaneously@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will not need fayet - iliopoulos terms to break supersymmetry .",
    "let us illustrate our method using an example from the class _ a _ models with @xmath28 and @xmath158 and two pairs of higgs doublets : @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the generalization to the other cases is straightforward .",
    "we choose the superpotential of the form : @xmath161 the potential can be written down from this as follows : @xmath162 the d - terms are not shown but they are given by standard expressions .",
    "we choose @xmath163 .",
    "it is then easy to see that global minimum of the theory corresponds to @xmath164 ; @xmath165 and @xmath166 . to get the gaugino masses",
    ", we do not need the @xmath167 vev since the mass term @xmath78 plays that role in this theory . an important point to emphasize",
    "is that in the tree level @xmath168 vanishes giving rise to a flat direction .",
    "this is however stabilized giving small @xmath167 vev once loop effects are taken into account .",
    "the important point to note is that the fields @xmath159 which play the role of messenger fields do not have vev .",
    "this was guaranteed by the fact that there is a second pair of similar fields and that the mass parameter @xmath77 is larger than other mass parameters in the theory .",
    "one can therefore include any pair of fields ( including colored fields ) as messenger fields and keep them from acquiring vev provided we add a second identical pair and add a mass term analogous to @xmath77 which is large .",
    "note that , below the susy breaking scale we have only a pair of light higgs doublets .",
    "let us now apply the above discussion to the model ai .",
    "we start with three pairs of @xmath169 which have the same quantum numbers under the gauge group @xmath0 as before and distinguished from each other by a prime .",
    "we then write the following superpotential : @xmath170 it is easy to see that for @xmath163 , the ground state corresponds to @xmath31 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 having nonvanishing vev s exactly as in the case above and @xmath173 .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking is then transmitted via the @xmath28 fields to the visible sector .",
    "an exactly analogous construction applies to the case aiii with two pairs of color octets@xcite replacing the doublets in the case above .",
    "as far as the left - right symmetric group is concerned , we replace the the @xmath28 s above by the @xmath174 triplets and the doublets by the appropriate bidoublets .",
    "again the above discussion carries through in a straight forward manner .",
    "finally , we wish to note that , it is possible to give a superpotential for the case ai , for which both the electroweak as well as the @xmath175 symmetry breaking arises from radiative corrections .",
    "we discuss this in appendix a. the phenomenological profile of this model is similar to the case ai with the difference that there is an extra light gaugino ( with mass in the 100 gev range ) .",
    "this model will also predict a light higgs in the range of 30 to 40 gev and hence is not consistent with present observations .",
    "we present it in the appendix in any case since it has the amusing feature that all gauge symmetries in this model are broken radiatively and @xmath33 is the sole mediator of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the sparticle spectroscopy and tests of a new class of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models with the gauge group @xmath0 and its left - right symmetric version.the main reason for choosing the alternative messenger sectors is that we want to maintain r - parity conservation and the good fcnc properties while keeping the model phenomenologically viable . in one of the models , model ai , the supersymmetry breaking is transmitted via the @xmath33 gauge interactions . in this case",
    "however , we find that the light higgs mass is too low for most of the parameter range that we investigated .",
    "we then investigate alternative messenger sectors involving color octets and @xmath38 doublets .",
    "we find that when we have a pair of color octets and a pair of @xmath38 doublets , the model @xmath0 has the interesting prediction that the lightest neutralino is always the nlsp and is very light ( in the 50 gev range or less ) .",
    "this would therefore be testable at lepii through the direct production of the neutralinos or at tevatron through the decays of the charginos that would eventually lead to photonic events accompanied by lepton pairs , leptons and jets or pairs of jets .",
    "the lightest neutralino mass is however larger in another version of the model where we have two pairs of doublets contributing to the susy breaking soft masses . in this case",
    "the masses of the susy particles can be safely beyond the present experimental bound .",
    "the left - right version of the model also has similar results .",
    "we are very thankful to d. strom and g. snow for useful comments regarding the experimental aspects of this work .",
    "we also like to acknowledge useful discussions and communications with c. y. chang , g. farrar , e. gross , a. jawahery , m. luty and m. schmitt .",

    "de - fg02 - 94-er40852 .      in this appendix",
    "we discuss a superpotential where the scales of supersymmetry breaking and the @xmath33 symmetry breaking are decoupled from each other and all gauge symmetry breakings arise from the radiative renormalization group evolution of the soft breakings .",
    "furthermore the supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the visible sector only via the @xmath33 gauge interactions .",
    "the phenomenological profile of this model is similar in all respects to the model ai except that the @xmath33 gaugino in this model is also light .",
    "it therefore leads to a light higgs mass which is too low in the absence of any new contributions .",
    "nevertheless we present the model since it is particularly simple and could be of interest as a realistic model if any new contribution to the higgs mass could be found .",
    "the messenger sector of the model consists only of two pairs @xmath176 fields and a singlet field s. the superpotential of the model is given by : @xmath177 for @xmath163 , the ground state of this theory has all @xmath28 s having zero vevs and @xmath178 .",
    "thus supersymmetry is broken at the scale and can be transmitted to the visible sector via the @xmath28 fields . a combination of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 gaugino acquires mass at the one loop level via the usual gmsb diagrams and the squarks and the sleptons acquire masses at the two loop level .",
    "once we include the @xmath179 term in the superpotential to implement the see - saw mechanism , there appears another minimum of the potential with @xmath180 but other fields with zero vev which is degenerate with the other minimum .",
    "this leads to the breakdown of @xmath22 down to @xmath23 .",
    "this model then leads to dynamical breaking of r - parity symmetry which however conserves baryon number .",
