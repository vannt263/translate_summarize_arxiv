    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is a theory of strong interaction that accounts for the rich phenomenology of hadronic and nuclear physics .",
    "however , the theory is not yet very well understood because of its nonperturbative nature .",
    "ongoing ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments at rhic bnl and lhc cern have indicated the formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a deconfined state of matter , transformed from hadronic matter at very high temperatures and/or densities as predicted by asymptotic freedom of qcd .",
    "the qcd phase diagram is not only essential for understanding the phenomena in the laboratory experiments involving relativistic heavy - ion collisions but also for the natural phenomena such as compact stars and the early universe .",
    "the phase diagram of hot and/or dense system of quarks and gluons predicted by the qcd has invited a lot of serious theoretical investigations for last few decades .",
    "the first prototype of the qcd phase diagram was conjectured in @xcite where it looked very simple ; with the passage of time more and more investigations culminated in a very complicated looking phase diagram with many exotic phases @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the interest mainly revolved around two phase transitions - one is the chiral phase transition and the other one is the deconfinement transition .",
    "if they do not coincide , exotic phases such as the constituent quark phase  @xcite or the quarkyonic phase  @xcite may occur .",
    "so , an important question on the qcd thermodynamics is whether the chiral symmetry restoration and the confinement - to - deconfinement transition happen simultaneously or not .",
    "we note that chiral and deconfinement transitions are conceptually two distinct phenomena . though lattice qcd simulation has confirmed that these two transitions occur at the same temperature @xcite or almost at the same temperature @xcite .",
    "whether this is a mere coincidence or some dynamics between the two phenomena are influencing each other is not understood yet and is matter of intense current research exploration .",
    "to understand the reason behind this coincidence a conjecture has been proposed in the article @xcite through a strong correlation or entanglement between the chiral condensate ( @xmath1 ) and the polyakov loop expectation value ( @xmath2 ) within the polyakov loop extended nambu@xmath0jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model .",
    "usually , in pnjl model , there is a weak correlation between the chiral dynamics @xmath1 and the confinement - deconfinement dynamics @xmath2 that is in - built through the covariant derivative between quark and gauge fields . with this kind of weak correlation the coincidence between the chiral and deconfinement crossover transitions",
    "@xcite can be described but it requires some fine - tuning of parameters , inclusion of the scalar type eight - quark interaction for zero chemical potential @xmath3 and the vector - type four - quark interaction for imaginary @xmath3 .",
    "this reveals that there may be a stronger correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 than that in the usual pnjl model associated through the covariant derivative between quark and gauge fields . also , some recent analyses  @xcite of the exact renormalization - group ( erg ) equation  @xcite suggest a strong entanglement interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath1 in addition to the original entanglement through the covariant derivative .",
    "based on this the two - flavor pnjl model is further generalized  @xcite by considering the effective four - quark scalar type interaction with the coupling strength that depends on the polyakov loop ( pl ) field @xmath2 .",
    "the effective vertex in turn generates entanglement interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "such generalization of the pnjl model is known as entangled - pnjl ( epnjl ) model  @xcite .",
    "this epnjl model has been used to study the location of the tricritical point at real isospin chemical potential  @xcite and on the location of the critical endpoint at real quark - number chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to study  @xcite the effect of dynamical generation of a repulsive vector contribution to the quark pressure .",
    "the epnjl model has further been generalized to the three - flavor phase diagram  @xcite as a function of light- and strange - quark masses for both zero and imaginary quark chemical potential .",
    "it is well known that many of the hadron properties are encoded in the correlation function and its spectral representation .",
    "the properties of the vector current correlation function and its spectral representation in the deconfined phase have been studied to understand the nonperturbative effect on the vector current spectral properties , e.g. , the dilepton production rate in lattice qcd ( lqcd ) framework  @xcite .",
    "recently , in pnjl model that takes into account nonperturbative effects like chiral and confinement dynamics , we have analysed  @xcite the effect of isoscalar - vector interaction on the vector meson spectral function and its various spectral properties ( _ viz . _ , dilepton production rate and the quark number susceptibility ( qns ) associated with the conserved density fluctuation ) in a hot and dense medium . in present article",
    ", we consider the idea of the epnjl model in which the effective vertex generates a strong entanglement interaction between the chiral condensate @xmath1 and the polyakov loop @xmath2 to re - explore the vector spectral function and the spectral property such as the dilepton production rate previously studied in @xcite . because of this strong entanglement between @xmath2 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the coupling strengths run with the temperature and chemical potential .",
    "first we study the characteristics of mean fields with various constraints : with and without the isoscalar - vector interaction in both pnjl and epnjl models .",
    "then we further demonstrate the effect of the entanglement on vector meson spectral function and dilepton rate .",

    "the scalar type four - quark coupling strength is fixed along with three momentum cutoff @xmath23 and bare quark mass @xmath29 to reproduce known zero temperature chiral physics in the hadronic sector . however , the value of the vector coupling is difficult to fix from the mass scale ( @xmath31-meson mass ) which is greater than the intrinsic scale @xmath23 of the effective theory .",
    "some efforts have been made in the literature to estimate the value of the vector coupling mainly by fitting lattice data .",
    "however , there exists ambiguity about its value as discussed . nevertheless , the introduction of vector interaction in heavy - ion physics is important for study of the spectral property like dilepton rate at non - zero chemical potential . on the other hand , in nuclear astrophysics",
    "the formation of stars with quark matter core depends strongly on the existence of a quark vector repulsion .",
    "however , in pnjl model both the couplings are considered to be constant in the literature .",
    "since , this model also contains temporal gluons these couplings , in principle , should depend on the polyakov loop fields .",
    "but this dependence is usually neglected and the correlation of the polyakov loop and chiral dynamics is a weak one as it arises through the covariant derivative that couples the quark and the temporal gauge field in the model .    in this article",
    "we have extended the usual pnjl model by introducing a strong entanglement between the chiral ( @xmath1 ) and the polyakov loop dynamics ( @xmath2 ) , known as epnjl model in the literature .",
    "the strong entanglement has been introduced via effective four - quark scalar type interaction that obeys the centre symmetry , @xmath136 of pure @xmath12 gauge group .",
    "since the polyakov loop and chiral fields run with temperature and chemical potential , the entanglement makes also those coupling run .",
    "this entanglement effect is capable of reproducing the coincidence of chiral ( @xmath56 ) and deconfinement ( @xmath46 ) transition temperature within the range provided by the 2-flavour lattice data .",
    "the spectral function of the vector current - current correlation is related to the production of lepton pairs , which is considered as an important probe of the deconfined hadronic matter and has been measured in high energy heavy - ion experiments  @xcite . on the other hand , at rhic and lhc energies",
    "the maximum temperature reached of a hot and dense strongly interacting matter created is not very far from the phase transition temperature @xmath51 and is nonperturbative in nature . in lqcd framework",
    "the dilepton production rate  @xcite at finite temperature but zero chemical potential has also been computed using a spectral function obtained from euclidean correlation function through a probabilistic method that involves certain uncertainties and intricacies  @xcite . in our previous calculation",
    "@xcite within pnjl model , the influence of the four - quark scalar and isoscalar - vector interaction without entanglement effect on the spectral function vis - a - vis the dilepton production was studied . in this article",
    "we have updated the spectral function and the dilepton production rate within the epnjl model that takes into consideration the entanglement between the polyakov loop and the chiral dynamics through scalar and vector interaction . in pnjl model",
    "both scalar and vector couplings do not run and the dominance of the polyakov loop fields substantially suppresses the color degrees of freedom around the phase transition temperature . on",
    "the other hand epnjl model introduces a strong entanglement between the chiral and the polyakov loop dynamics which relatively enhances color degrees of freedom in the deconfined phase compared to the pnjl model . because of this the strength of the vector spectral function is suppressed and the peak is shifted to a higher energy compared to that of pnjl model but the strength is higher than the free one at low energy .",
    "since the dilepton production is related to the vector spectral function , it is also suppressed in epnjl model compared to the pnjl model but is more compared to the born rate ( leading order perturbative one ) in the deconfined phase .",
    "this indicates relatively less production of lepton pairs at low energy with entangled vector interaction .",
    "however , as the strength of the vector interaction is increased there is a relative increase in the strength of the spectral function in both epnjl and pnjl model , which also results in a relatively more production in lepton pairs at low invariant mass .",
