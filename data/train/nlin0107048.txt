    "thermostatted , field - driven systems have been popular models for non - equilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd ) simulation studies of transport processes in fluids .",
    "nemd studies consider systems with a large number of particles interacting with each other , driven by an external field @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the thermostat continuously removes the energy generated inside the system due to the work done on it by the external field , by means of a dynamical friction term in the equations of motion .",
    "one finds that for these systems , a non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) , homogeneous in space , is reached after a sufficiently long time @xcite .",
    "here we consider a particular kind of thermostat , where the friction is linearly coupled to the laboratory momenta and keeps the total laboratory kinetic energy of the particles constant ( i.e , isokinetic gaussian thermostat coupled to the laboratory momenta )",
    ". the dynamical description of these systems , would be hamiltonian in the absence of this thermostat , and the corresponding hamiltonian system , obtained by dropping the dynamical friction term from the equations of motion , will be referred to as the _ background hamiltonian system_. due to the presence of the dynamical friction terms in the equations of motion , such a system is no longer hamiltonian with a conservation of phase space volumes , but instead is phase - space contracting @xcite .",
    "the sum of all the lyapunov exponents , which measures the rate of long - time exponential growth of phase - space volume , for such a system is thus negative @xcite .",
    "of course , the background hamiltonian system , if chaotic , is such that the lyapunov exponents sum up to zero .",
    "furthermore , due to its symplectic form , the lyapunov exponents of the background system come in pairs such that the sum of each such pair is also zero @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of such pairing of lyapunov exponents , where the sum of each pair of non - zero exponents takes a constant value independent of the particular pair , is known as the _ conjugate pairing rule _ ( cpr ) .",
    "dettmann and morriss @xcite have studied the isokinetic gaussian thermostatted field - driven systems that are under consideration here , assuming that the particles of the system interact with smooth pair potential energies , and that the forces on the particles due to the external field depends _ only on their positions_. they have proved that under these conditions , in a restricted subspace of the phase space of all the particles , characterized by all the non - zero lyapunov exponents , such a system is @xmath0-symplectic - symplecticity condition , see eqs .",
    "( [ e7a ] ) and ( [ e7b ] ) of this paper .",
    "the usual symplectic condition is a particular case of eq .",
    "( [ e7a ] ) with @xmath1 . ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the cpr is exactly satisfied in that subspace , and it is independent of the number of particles in the system ( corresponding simulation results can be found in @xcite )  the sum of each pair comes out to be the same negative constant . one important consequence of this result is that the macroscopic transport coefficients of these systems , in the linear order , can be obtained from this constant value of the sum ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the restricted subspace , characterized by all the non - zero lyapunov exponents , is identified by observing that with an isokinetic gaussian thermostat , trajectories of the system always lie on a constant total kinetic energy hypersurface in the phase space of all the particles .",
    "this constraint generates a zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "also , two points in the phase space do not separate exponentially in time if one point is chosen in the direction of flow of the other .",
    "this generates another zero lyapunov exponent .    as hard - core inter - particle interaction",
    "can be dealt as a limiting case of a very short range smooth potential , one would expect that in this restricted subspace , the system is still @xmath0-symplectic , and as a result , the cpr will continue to hold for a field - driven isokinetic gaussian thermostatted system with hard - core inter - particle interactions .",
    "the corresponding pairing of lyapunov exponents for hard - sphere systems has been proved by direct means using the differential geometric structure of the phase space , by wojtkowski and liverani @xcite .",
    "another version of the proof for hard - sphere systems has been obtained by ruelle @xcite .",
    "the above two approaches for hard - sphere systems are somewhat difficult to follow .",
    "the purpose of this paper therefore , is to present a proof of the pairing of lyapunov exponents ( also by direct means ) for hard - sphere systems at constant kinetic energy , based on a very simple explicit geometric construction , similar to that used by ruelle .",
    "two kinds of field - driven isokinetic gaussian thermostatted systems with hard - core interaction are considered here : in section ii , the proof of the cpr is carried out for the three - dimensional lorentz gas , where mutually non - interacting point particles suffer specular collisions with fixed spherical scatterers . in section iii , the proof is then carried out for a gas of hard spheres .",
    "the explicit method of this paper allows one to identify the dependence of these approaches ( described in refs . @xcite and here ) on the geometrical shapes of the scatterers ( or the particles , as the case may be ) and on the nature of the externally applied field .",
    "based on it , generalizations to higher dimensions , to arbitrary geometry of the scatterers or the particles , and to the case where the masses of the particles are arbitrary , become trivial . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we argue that this construction can be used to prove the cpr for hard - sphere systems in an external field with a nos - hoover thermostat .",
    "we also identify situations of physical interest , where these approaches break down .",
    "the lorentz gas model consists of a set of scatterers fixed in space together with mutually non - interacting moving particles that suffer elastic , specular collisions with the scatterers .",
    "here we consider the version of the model in three dimensions where the scatterers are hard spheres , and are placed in space without overlapping .",
    "each of the moving particles is a point particle with unit mass @xmath2 , and is subjected to an external force that depends _ only on its position _ , as well as a gaussian thermostat which is designed to keep its kinetic energy at a constant value . during a flight , the equation of motion of a particle is @xmath3\\,=\\,\\left[\\,\\vec{p}\\,,\\,\\,\\,\\vec{f}\\,-\\,\\alpha\\vec{p}\\,\\right]\\ , , \\label{e1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the force on the particle due to the external field and @xmath5 is the coefficient of dynamical friction representing the isokinetic gaussian thermostat .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is obtained from the fact that the kinetic energy of the particle @xmath6 is constant during a flight , i.e , @xmath7 and without any loss of generality , the time hereafter is rescaled such that @xmath8 . at a collision with a scatterer ,",

    "it is sufficient to consider the motion of only one of the moving particles in its six - dimensional phase space to investigate the chaotic properties of this system , since they do not interact with each other . to obtain the lyapunov exponents , we consider a particle at the phase space location @xmath13 $ ] at time @xmath14 . in time",

    "while much of the content of this paper is technical , the underlying principle behind our discussion of the cpr is similar to those in the existing literature @xcite .",
    "first , the dimension of the phase space is identified where all the lyapunov exponents are non - zero .",
    "the dimension of this reduced phase space , characterized by all the non - zero lyapunov exponents , depends on the number of macroscopic conserved quantities in the problem ( such as total momentum , total angular momentum , total energy etc . ) that are consistent with the dynamics . by means of confining the dynamics to a hypersurface of dimension 1 less than that of the full phase space ,",
    "each such conserved quantity reduces the dimension of the phase space characterized by all the non - zero lyapunov exponents by 1 . in addition",
    ", the fact that two points in the phase space do not separate exponentially in time if one point is chosen in the direction of flow of the other , reduces the dimension of the phase space characterized by the non - zero lyapunov exponents also by 1 .",
    "the dynamics for systems with hard - core inter - particle interactions are then decomposed into flights and collisions .",
    "the dynamics of a flight segment in the reduced phase space is shown to be @xmath0-symplectic as a special case of the explicit geometric construction in ref . @xcite . by means of another simple explicit geometric construction ,",
    "it is also possible to incorporate the collisions in this formalism , which subsequently leads one to evaluate the matrix @xmath68 and demonstrate that it is symplectic .",
    "finally , the matrix @xmath31 , assembled from the sequential products of the @xmath150 and @xmath68 matrices , is easily seen to be @xmath0-symplectic using the fact that the product of a symplectic and a @xmath0-symplectic transformation is @xmath0-symplectic .",
    "we must note here that the proof of cpr by this construction is _ sufficient and not necessary _ ; and as a result , if a system does not satisfy this proof , it is _ not _ guaranteed that cpr would not be satisfied for it .",
    "moreover , this explicit geometric construction , used in this paper for the parallel transport of basis vectors , is by no means unique .",
    "one could conceivably use a different set of equations for the parallel transport mechanisms for both flight and collision parts of the dynamics to prove the cpr for a dynamical system .    questions naturally arise about the applicability of this construction for other hard - particle systems .",
    "it turns out that using the same explicit geometric construction that is presented here , cpr can also be proved for a gas of hard particles ( of finite sizes ) in an external field ( such that the forces on the particles due to this field depend only on their positions of the particles ) under a nos - hoover thermostat .",
    "one simply has to separate the time evolution of @xmath67 in terms of the @xmath150 and the @xmath68 matrices in an appropriately reduced phase space .",
    "the @xmath0-symplecticity of the @xmath150 matrices can be trivially obtained as a special case of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the cpr has been proved for a system of particles that interact with each other by means of smooth interparticle potentials .",
    "the symplecticity property of the @xmath68 matrices can also be easily seen to be valid , if one combines the observation of point _",
    "( ii ) _ of sec . iii.a with eq .",
    "( 15 ) of ref .",
    "we have seen in point _",
    "( ii ) _ of sec . iii.a that for @xmath68 to be symplectic , it is necessary that @xmath120 be invariant under a collision , and it is definitely the case with eq .",
    "( 15 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "clearly , this explicit geometric construction allows one to see the role of the external field in between collisions ( that it is necessary for the force on the particles due to the external field be dependent only on their positions ) , the role of @xmath120 and the geometry of the colliding particles ( or scatterers , as the case may be ) for it to prove the cpr .",
    "however , these conditions , under which this construction works to prove the cpr , are rather restrictive in the context of nemd studies of the transport quantities of the systems of physical interest , as they exclude a class of very interesting systems where the external force may depend on the momenta of the particles  for example , when the system is subjected to an additional external magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , it has allowed us to prove an important theoretical result regarding the cpr , for a gas of hard spheres under shear @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that this choice of parallel transport can be used for numerical computations to achieve higher accuracy for the lyapunov exponents .",
    "we end this paper with the observation that while this construction uses explicit dependence on the co - ordinate system on a euclidean manifold , there exists a ( co - ordinate independent ) differential geometric method ( for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that allows one to work easily on non - euclidean manifolds @xcite as well .",
    "how this present construction can be generalized to such non - euclidean manifolds is presently unclear , but it remains a challenging task for the future .",
