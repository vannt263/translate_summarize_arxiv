    "liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) techniques have proved a convenient test - bed for implementing quantum algorithms @xcite . however , a conventional nmr quantum computer starts off in an initial state which is very similar to a maximally mixed state , due to the tiny population differences between the energy levels of the spin-@xmath2 nuclei which act as the qubits @xcite .    various approaches to this initialization problem have been suggested .",
    "firstly , it is possible to convert thermal states into pseudopure states @xcite : this approach has been adopted in the vast majority of nmr implementations of qip , but is not scalable @xcite .",
    "secondly , non - boltzmann distributions can be prepared , for example with _",
    "para_-hydrogen@xcite , giving almost pure states which lie above the entanglement threshold @xcite .",
    "thirdly , computational schemes have been described @xcite which concentrate the small polarization available on a large number of spins into a smaller subspace .    here",
    "we investigate the effects of polarization sharing on achieving states of useful purity .",
    "the schemes mentioned above _ concentrate _ polarization onto a _",
    "smaller _ subset of spins , but we study the effects of spreading the polarization over a _",
    "larger _ subset of spins .",
    "we assume that the polarization sharing results in a pseudopure state with a purity characterized by a bias parameter @xmath3 that we define below .",
    "the bias is then compared with known entanglement bounds derived for pseudopure states .",
    "in the high temperature approximation , the initial state of a ( homonuclear ) nmr quantum computer is @xmath4 where @xmath0 is the total number of spins , @xmath5 is the identity matrix of order @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a boltzmann factor and @xmath8 is the @xmath9 pauli matrix for spin @xmath10 .",
    "a standard implementation of an algorithm requires the quantum computer to start off in a pure state , characterised by having a single non - zero eigenvalue , of size one . clearly , the thermal state has many different eigenvalues and so to prepare pure from thermal states , a non - unitary process must be employed at some stage .",
    "cooling to the ground state is an example of such a process , but is ineffective in nmr due to the small energy gaps involved .",
    "pseudopure @xmath1-qubit states have an eigenvalue spectrum between these extremes , having one large eigenvalue and @xmath11 degenerate smaller eigenvalues .",
    "this means that thermal states can be converted into pseudopure states by particularly simple non - unitary processes , such as averaging @xmath11 population terms .",
    "a general @xmath1-qubit pseudopure state @xmath12 takes the form @xmath13 with dynamics identical to those of the corresponding pure state @xmath14 .",
    "( we explicitly use the symbol @xmath12 to denote pseudopure states . ) the state is characterised by a single parameter , @xmath3 , which we call the bias of the state .",
    "another useful description is to write out the pseudopure state explicitly in its eigenbasis with the eigenvalues in descending order to give @xmath15}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] denotes a diagonal matrix and @xmath17 is both the fractional population of the desired state @xmath14 and the _ largest _ eigenvalue and is related to the bias by @xmath18    a pseudopure state will always be separable if @xmath3 is less than some critical value , and braunstein _",
    "_ @xcite have described upper and lower bounds on separability .",
    "a state of the form given in eq .",
    "[ rho - pseudo ] was shown to be explicitly separable for sufficiently small biases such that @xmath19 and we say that these states belong to the region * s*.",
    "if the bias exceeds their upper bound@xmath20 the state is said to lie in the entangled region * e * , or more appropriately the _",
    "entanglable _ @xcite region . in the region in between , * es * , it is not known whether entangled states can be prepared .",
    "these bounds were subsequently improved , shrinking the size of * es*. for example , gurvits and barnum @xcite have tightened the lower bound to @xmath21 current nmr implementations with boltzmann initialization use states lying in the separable region * s * and it seems possible to enter the region * es * only by employing more qubits .",
    "for example , using the gurvits  barnum lower bound with a typical boltzmann factor of @xmath22 , the state will cross over into * es * for @xmath23 .",
    "similar themes have been taken up by other authors as well .",
    "et al . _ have shown @xcite that by using unitarily transformed thermal states in place of pseudopure states , the * es * to * e * transition can take place with a smaller number of qubits : making pseudopure states from thermal states involves convex mixing and , therefore , decreases the likelihood of entanglement .",
    "other researchers have shown @xcite that entanglement can also exist in a @xmath24 dimensional quantum system , when _ only _ the qubit is pure and the @xmath25 dimensional system is in a highly mixed state , such as a two level atom interacting with a high temperature field .    here",
    "we investigate the _ sharing _ of polarization within a pseudopure quantum subspace .",
    "we consider an initial state @xmath26 where @xmath0 is the total number of qubits of which @xmath27 qubits are in the state , @xmath28 having a polarization @xmath29 and the remaining @xmath30 qubits are maximally mixed .",
    "our goal is to compute the achievable bias in a @xmath1 qubit pseudopure state where @xmath31 , _ i.e. _ , we are interested in the transformation @xmath32 .",
    "we achieve this in two steps : ( a ) convert @xmath33 into a @xmath1 qubit state @xmath34 using a partial trace operation , and then ( b ) convert @xmath34 into a pseudopure state @xmath35 using cyclic averaging .    for simplicity",
    "consider a state @xmath36 with all the @xmath27 qubits being perfectly polarized , @xmath37}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] and consider the case @xmath38 . partially tracing @xcite out",
    "the @xmath39 qubits from @xmath36 leaves us with the @xmath1 qubit reduced state @xmath40}.\\ ] ] this is also a pseudopure state @xmath41 with maximum achievable bias of one .",
    "the partial trace operation reduces the dimensionality of the system and for a diagonal state , is equivalent to taking partial sums of consecutive eigenvalues along the ordered diagonal .",
    "physically , it just corresponds to ignoring the @xmath39 qubits . in the case of @xmath38 , the reduced subspace after the partial trace operation is already a ( pseudo)pure state , with @xmath42 .",
    "this will also be the case when @xmath43 .",
    "however , for @xmath44 , the reduced state @xmath34 will have several different eigenvalues .",
    "we can explicitly generate the desired pseudopure state by writing the mixed state in its ordered eigenbasis and then averaging over cyclic permutations of the @xmath11 trailing elements .",
    "this procedure ( which can be considered as a generalisation of the twirl operation @xcite ) is experimentally implementable by exhaustive temporal averaging @xcite ; more efficient procedures are also available @xcite .",
    "a non - unitary process can not increase the maximum eigenvalue of a state @xmath45 , but by definition , a pseudopure state has only one non - degenerate eigenvalue which must coincide with the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath45 .",
    "cyclic averaging leaves this eigenvalue unchanged and therefore extracts the maximum bias @xmath3 .",
    "algebraic manipulation shows that the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath35 is given by the formula @xmath46 which is the overlap between the states ( [ rho - start ] ) and ( [ rho - target ] ) .",
    "note that we do not consider here precisely _ how _ the polarization sharing procedures might be implemented in practice , but simply determine the limits .",
    "our results are summarised in fig .",
    "[ graphics1 ] and exemplified below .",
    "pure [ ( a)(e ) ] or partially pure [ ( f)(i ) ] spins on quantum subspaces . starting with @xmath27 pure spins ( a )",
    ", we can _ pick _ @xmath47 pure spins ( b ) and extract all the available polarization .",
    "the polarization can also be _ spread _ onto a bigger subspace while retaining the entanglability ( c ) .",
    "sharing the polarization within even higher dimensional subspaces decreases the resulting bias and therefore the possibility of entanglement , ( d ) and ( e ) . as the size of the extracted subspace increases , the bias drops exponentially .",
    "smaller biases are shown by lighter tones of grey .",
    "for @xmath27 partially polarized spins ( f ) , we can _ concentrate _ the bias onto smaller subspaces ( g ) or spread it onto bigger subspaces , ( h ) and ( i ) , with a corresponding decrease in the bias reducing the likelihood of entanglement .",
    "[ graphics1 ] ]",
    "considering the form of equation [ rho - target ] ( @xmath0 spins out of which @xmath27 are perfectly polarized and the rest are maximally mixed ) , we see that @xmath17 is given by @xmath48 and from equation  [ delta - fvalue ] the achievable bias is @xmath49 for @xmath43 , _ all _ the purity can be extracted as this is equivalent to picking out the pure spins from a set of pure and maximally mixed spins . the case @xmath50 is more interesting as this involves distributing the polarization of @xmath27 spins over a larger subspace and is the polarization sharing that we shall be mainly interested in .     and @xmath51 pure spins .",
    "the upper shaded region is * e * and the lower shaded region is * s * , whereas * es * is in between .",
    "the border between two regions belongs to the less entangled region .",
    "the regions are intended to guide the eye , and are only shown for @xmath52 or more spins , where the concept of entanglement is valid.[graphics2 ] ]    figure [ graphics2 ] shows the results for @xmath27 pure spins , with @xmath53 and @xmath51 . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the bias falls off exponentially as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "examining equation  [ rho - target ] also shows that adding extra qubits ( increasing @xmath0 ) neither hinders nor helps the extraction of purity onto qubits ; it seems that the only role of @xmath0 is that it limits the number of spins in the pseudopure subspace , as evidently @xmath31 .",
    "of course these additional qubits may assist the implementation of the manipulations necessary to prepare the pseudopure state , but they have no ultimate effect on the extracted bias .",
    "the biases of the @xmath1-qubit pseudopure subspaces can now be compared with the entanglement bounds , but for the possibility of entanglement to arise in the first place , the pure component in the pseudopure state must be entangled . for example , the direct product @xmath52-qubit state @xmath54 is pure , but is clearly separable .",
    "however , one can always find a unitary operator that converts an arbitrary pure state into any desired pure target state , be it entangled or otherwise .",
    "any pure state is therefore _",
    "unitarily equivalent _ to an entangled state of the same dimensions , and we can assume that our @xmath1-qubit pseudopure state comprises a pure , entangled component mixed in with the maximally mixed state .",
    "this is the justification for using the term _ entanglable _ for the region * e * , as mentioned in the previous section .    for @xmath47 ,",
    "the @xmath1-qubit subspace is obviously in the region * e * but for @xmath50 , increasing @xmath1 leads to an exponential drop in the extractable bias @xmath3 . at some critical @xmath1 we step into the region * es*.",
    "this transition from * e * to * es * takes place where @xmath55 , which can be identified in figure [ graphics2 ] as the point at which the bias curve crosses into the region * es * , and occurs at @xmath56 .",
    "what this means is that if we start with @xmath27 perfectly polarized spins , then for @xmath57 our extracted system will be in * e*. however , for higher values of @xmath1 we shall be in * es*. we also note that as a result of this polarization sharing we will never enter * s * ; this is clear from the slopes of the lines in the figures , and a simple proof is given in the appendix .",
    "we now generalize the above example to consider @xmath27 spins that are not perfectly polarized , each having a uniform non - zero polarization @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath0-qubit state @xmath33 is now given by @xmath59{\\biggl.\\biggl.{\\ensuremath{\\stackrel{2^{n - p}\\ { \\rm { terms}}}{\\overbrace{\\left(\\frac{1+\\sigma}{2}\\right)^p } } } } , { \\ensuremath{\\stackrel{(2^{n - p}\\ ^pc_1)\\ { \\rm { terms}}}{\\overbrace{\\left(\\frac{1+\\sigma}{2}\\right)^{p-1}\\left(\\frac{1-\\sigma}{2}\\right)}}}},\\\\ & \\ldots\\biggr\\}\\biggr\\ } } , \\bdiagonalr{{\\ensuremath{\\stackrel{(2^{n - p}\\ ^pc_{p-1})\\ { \\rm { terms}}}{\\overbrace{\\left(\\frac{1+\\sigma}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-\\sigma}{2}\\right)^{p-1}}}}},{\\ensuremath{\\stackrel{2^{n - p}\\ { \\rm { terms}}}{\\overbrace{\\left(\\frac{1-\\sigma}{2}\\right)^p } } } } } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the binomial coefficient . if @xmath61 , calculating @xmath17 involves summing only the first @xmath62 terms , each being of the same size @xmath63 .",
    "this is best illustrated with a numerical example .",
    "consider a state with @xmath64 and @xmath53 @xmath65}\\ ] ] and suppose we want to share the purity over a @xmath66-qubit subspace ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "calculating @xmath17 will only involve a partial sum of the first @xmath68 terms in ( [ rho-42sigma ] ) , each of these terms being @xmath69 .",
    "similarly if @xmath70 , we need a partial sum over the first @xmath51 terms and for @xmath71 , we need to consider just the first term . in each of these cases only the leading terms are involved in the partial sums , and we can derive a formula for @xmath17 @xmath72 with a corresponding bias @xmath73 if @xmath43 we are concentrating polarization onto a subspace smaller than the original , and can expect to extract a higher bias . in this case the overlap and bias must be calculated explicitly on a case by case basis .",
    "we do not consider this polarization concentration further .    .",
    "the figure demonstrates polarization sharing for @xmath74 pure and @xmath74 impure spins .",
    "the effect of sharing from a single weakly polarized spin is also shown ; when shared over @xmath75 or more spins the state moves from being provably separable into the region where it is unknown whether or not it may be entangled.note , however , that states currently placed in * es * may subsequently move to * s * if lower bounds are further tightened.[graphics3 ] ]    as with perfectly polarized spins , sharing from impure spins also entails an exponential decrease in the extractable bias as the size of the subspace @xmath1 increases .",
    "the critical size @xmath76 for impure states at which the state is no longer provably entangled is now given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 represents the next higher integer to @xmath79 ( only integral numbers of spins are possible ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that with @xmath27 partially polarized spins , polarization can be shared over a smaller number of qubits than when the @xmath27 spins are ideally polarized , as shown in figure  [ graphics2 ] .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that given @xmath27 perfectly polarized spins , we can share polarization among @xmath80 spins , such that their bias keeps them in the provably entangled region .",
    "for example , for @xmath53 pure spins , we can spread the polarization over @xmath66 spins , while `` protecting '' the entanglement .",
    "similar results can be achieved when the initial spins are not completely polarized : from ( [ k - critical - sigma ] ) , we find that for @xmath81 , it is possible to spread the polarization of @xmath52 qubits onto a higher spin subspace .",
    "our results suggest that polarization sharing is of limited value with only a single pair of protons from _",
    "para_-hydrogen  added onto our substrate molecule @xcite , but show more promise for a higher number of molecules @xmath82 .",
    "preparing such molecules is in principle possible and we are currently investigating approaches for such multi - qubit systems .",
    "when sharing polarization from @xmath27 pure qubits , the system always lies within the regions * e * and * es * , never entering the explicitly separable region * s*. to prove this we must show that the extracted purity is always greater than the gurvits  barnum bound , @xmath83    the left hand side of equation  [ lower - bound - interscet ] will be a minimum when @xmath84 , and so it suffices to prove this extreme case : @xmath85 now the l.h.s .",
    "of is clearly greater than @xmath86 .",
    "so the inequality will be true when the ratio of @xmath86 and right hand side of is greater than unity .",
