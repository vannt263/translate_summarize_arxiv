    "<S> we study the competition between various forms of density - wave - like order parameters that may arise in multi - orbital correlated materials with strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) within a renormalization - group ( rg ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are restricted to models with two spin - orbit split bands having strong inter - band fermi surface nesting . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for such fermi surface topology , the interplay between the inter - band nesting and soc strongly enhances the inter - orbital coulomb interaction ( relative to other interactions ) as the system approaches a stable fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an exotic spin - orbit density wave ( sodw ) to become the energetically favorable symmetry - broken state . </S>",
    "<S> while the conclusions are generic to such a fermi surface topology , the band structure and the numerical results are presented for the iridate systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the electronic fingerprints of the sodw are in better agreement with various experimental results than a conventional spin density wave ( sdw ) , explaining the long - standing problem of the origin of the metal - insulator transition in these systems .    </S>",
    "<S> interaction - driven fermi surface ( fs ) instabilities can lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking and the emergence of ordered phases such as superconductivity , charge , spin , or orbital ordering . </S>",
    "<S> there has been significant recent interest in materials with strong spin - orbit interaction , e.g. , topological insulators , noncentrosymmetric superconductors , heavy - fermions and several oxide interfaces , which exhibit unconventional phases of matter  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and coulomb interactions can also give rise to novel exotic topological phases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what are the effect of soc on fs instabilities ? </S>",
    "<S> soc may favor symmetry - broken ordered states characterized by strong entangling of spin and orbital degrees of freedom , referred to spin - orbital density wave ( sodw ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> renormalizationgroup ( rg ) is a powerful method for analyzing the competing order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is applied extensively to bilayer graphene @xcite , iron - based superconductors @xcite , and related materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the objective of this paper is to provide the rg analysis of the competition between various fermi - surface instabilities toward density - wave order in the presence of strong soc .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on instabilities that lead to a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) by gapping out the fs . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , systems with narrow bandwidth in comparison with their correlation strength are prone to mit . </S>",
    "<S> the recent discovery of mit in pyroclore and perovskite iridates family @xcite with 5@xmath0 orbitals came as a surprise since their noninteracting bandwidth , @xmath1 , is estimated to be much larger than coulomb interaction @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> many theoretical approaches including strong @xcite and weak coupling @xcite theories suggest that the soc of the ir atoms is responsible for this phenomena @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the soc splitting of the @xmath3 orbitals leads to half - filled effective @xmath4 orbitals to be near the fermi level with an effective bandwidth @xmath5 which is smaller than the interaction strength @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> experimental data in sr - based iridates suggest that at the temperature @xmath670  k @xcite , where the mit sets in , the dc magnetization begins to drop , in contract to what is expected from a typical spin - ordered state . </S>",
    "<S> this result ( and other evidence as discussed in refs .  ) suggests that insulators arising from such soc - induced mit may have a complex form of spin - orbital order .    using a three - orbital tight - binding model relevant for sr@xmath7iro@xmath8  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we study the possible insulating states characterized by various spin , orbital , and spin - orbital entangled density waves by using the rg approach . </S>",
    "<S> the materials of interest exhibit antiferromagnetic order above @xmath9 ( and below a higher temperature @xmath10 for the magnetic transition ) . </S>",
    "<S> all density waves are anticipated to have an ordering vector @xmath11 in the model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( any system with a dominant nesting vector would have similar behavior ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , as this material is not known to be superconducting , we restrict our analysis to particle - hole instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> order parameters then correspond to the condensation of fermion bilinears at momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 in various spin and orbital sectors . in the most general case of sodw , </S>",
    "<S> both the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are different in the condensed fermionic bilinear . </S>",
    "<S> two other cases are spin density wave ( sdw ) with the same orbital and different spin , and orbital density wave ( odw ) with the same spin and different orbitals .    </S>",
    "<S> following ref .  , we use a three @xmath3 orbitals model with soc , relevant for the sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 , we can write the following noninteracting spin - orbit - coupled hamiltonian : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the annihilation operator for an electron with momentum @xmath12 and spin @xmath17 , residing on orbital @xmath18 ( respectively the three @xmath3 orbitals @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) , and @xmath22 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 are the bare dispersion for different orbitals ( defined in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the nesting with wavevector @xmath26 leads to a logarithmic divergence in the static magnetic susceptibility around this wave vector as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> various orderings can be studied by adding infinitesimal auxiliary fields for sdw , sodw , and odw [ see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the most general set of order parameters is rather large so , motivated by experimental results , we have limited the analysis to order parameters given in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> we should note that in this rg treatment , the flow of each order parameter only depends on the flow of the interaction coupling constants [ to be deduced in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sceqn ] ) below ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , inclusion and/or exclusion of any order parameter will not affect the flow equations for others . </S>",
    "<S> experiments in sr - based iridates have demonstrated that the spin ordering is collinear with moments oriented along the crystal - axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we fix the spin orientation to be along the @xmath34 axis . for the sodw , the symmetry thus allows an associated orbital ordering oriented in the in - plane , i.e. @xmath35 . we note that a sdw can arise in every orbital , while for the above hamiltonian , the sodw can naturally form only between @xmath20- ( orbital index 1 ) and @xmath19- ( orbital index 2 ) orbitals ( the spin flip between these orbitals is connected by the nesting vector @xmath36 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the linearized equations for the order parameters are presented graphically in fig .  1 of the supplemental material , which leads to the corresponding self - consistent equations as @xmath48 where @xmath33=`sdw ' , ` sodw ' , and ` odw ' , and @xmath49 are corresponding critical temperatures below which @xmath50 diverges . for a given order </S>",

    "<S> we expect this approximation to capture the essential physics given by the topology of the fs and a dominant nesting vector . using this weak - coupling assumption </S>",

    "<S> note that the complex conjugates of @xmath64 are the same as their original forms , and thus not considered separately .    </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of the rg equations is standard as depicted in fig .  2 of the supplemental material , and the corresponding coupled differential equations are @xmath65 where the ` dot ' symbol represents differentiation with respect to @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the above equations have run - away flows . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath67 , we can recast the above rg equation in terms of the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath68 and obtain ( both analytically and numerically ) stable fixed points for these dimensionless ratios . our numerical results for the full rg flow in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] shows a single stable fixed point for all interactions at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath72 and @xmath73 obtain finite fixed values only when their initial values are attractive , whereas @xmath74 can be started from any values and reach the same fixed point .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider the flow of the order - parameter vertices of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sceqn ] ) , and study the dominant divergent density wave at the fixed point in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> since the flow of the @xmath75 coupling is nontrivial and depends on its bare value , it is appropriate to assume a random - phase approximation ( rpa ) type flow of this interaction in response to the logarithmic susceptibility as @xmath76 , where we have chosen @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> all the results scales with the initial value of @xmath75 and thus its particular value is irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for a wide range of parameters ( chemical potential @xmath25 and soc @xmath24 , ) when the two fss , split by the soc , have strong interband nesting , the dressed interorbital coulomb interaction @xmath78 diverges more strongly than other parameters [ see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](c ) ] . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the sodw dominates over the sdw in such fs topology as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) and  [ fig3](d ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we check our prediction against experimental results on the electronic structure ( by employing the mean - field values of the order parameters ) . </S>",
    "<S> angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data @xcite in the insulating state of sr - based iridates pointed out that the direct insulating band gap minimum occurs at the x point , as opposed to at the m points as predicted by lda+u calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a recent scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / s ) also finds inconsistency in the details of the density of states ( dos ) with the theoretical calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the arpes data can be fit well with a sodw gap , rather than any sdw gap . for sdw and sodw , </S>",
    "<S> the insulating state can be achieved for @xmath79=300  mev , and @xmath80=1.2  ev with @xmath810.75  ev as shown in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , which gives the experimental insulating gap for sr - iridates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for sdw , the band top and bottom on both sides of the insulating gap occurs around the m point , whereas that for the sodw occurs at x point in good agreement with arpes experiment @xcite ( plotted by red dots in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , for any reasonably large values of the odw , we do not find an insulting state . </S>",
    "<S> this is because odw mainly occurs between the @xmath21 and @xmath82 orbitals and since @xmath21 orbital is not present near the fermi level , odw does not gap out the fs .    </S>",
    "<S> further evidence of sodw in the experimental data of iridates can be noted . in the bilayer sr@xmath83ir@xmath7o@xmath84 , e.g. , a clear magnetic order sets in below @xmath10=280  k with an increasing dc magnetization , which exhibits a surprising drop below @xmath670  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , the @xmath85-plane resistivity shows a power - law temperature dependence below @xmath10 ( a behavior expected of a semi - metallic phase ) , which then switches to an exponential temperature dependence below @xmath9 , marking the onset of the mit . </S>",
    "<S> a similar @xmath86-dependence of the resistivity and associated magnetic susceptibility is observed in nd@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath84 with @xmath10=120  k , and @xmath9=8  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two magnetic transitions were also found by @xmath25sr in ca@xmath87ir@xmath83o@xmath88 at @xmath89300k and 7.8k , in the single layered sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 at @xmath89100k and 20k @xcite , and in bulk sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 at @xmath86=100  k and 25  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of mit after a second magnetic transition ( with evidence of a complex electronic texture @xcite ) suggests sodw as a viable candidate for these low - temperature phases . </S>",
    "<S> our rg analysis supports this scenario .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we performed an rg analysis of various possible density - wave orders in systems with strong soc and a two - band nested fs . </S>",
    "<S> we found that rg flow ( toward the stable fixed point ) in such systems strongly enhances the relevant inter - orbital coupling interaction , @xmath38 , in comparison to the intra - orbital @xmath2 or hund s coupling @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> we studied the flow of the density - wave vertices for sdw , sodw , and odw . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the sodw involves @xmath38 , while sdw vertex involves @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , sodw is the dominant order parameter for the above - mentioned fs instability . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , exploring the role of sodw in mit , we found that the resulting electronic states of the sodw in sr@xmath83ir@xmath7o@xmath84 band structure are in better agreement ( than other candidate order parameters ) with experimental arpes results @xcite .    </S>",
