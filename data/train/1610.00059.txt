    "neutron stars in young supernova remnants are excellent targets for ground - based gravitational wave interferometers such as the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) .",
    "young neutron stars may be more promising targets than their older counterparts for three reasons .",
    "first , searches for periodic gravitational waves from younger neutron stars can more easily reach or probe below the indirect upper limits inferred from the spin - down rate @xmath3 ( where @xmath3 is measured ) or the age ( where @xmath3 is unknown ) .",
    "indirect wave strain upper limits are proportional to @xmath3 or inversely proportional to the age and hence are larger for younger neutron stars @xcite ; see also eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0upperlim ] ) in section [ sec : xieffect ] .",
    "second , less time has passed in young objects for their crusts and interiors to settle down and erase historical nonaxisymmetries frozen - in at birth .",
    "third , young objects spin down rapidly , driving crust - superfluid differential rotation which can excite nonaxisymmetric flows in the high - reynolds - number interior @xcite . for a review of gravitational wave generation mechanisms in neutron stars , see ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "even if young neutron stars emit gravitational waves strongly , their rapid spin down is a disadvantage for detection , because the phase of the gravitational wave signal evolves rapidly .",
    "a prohibitively large set of matched filters is needed for a coherent search , if a radio ephemeris is unavailable @xcite .",
    "hence less sensitive semi - coherent search strategies are favoured @xcite .",
    "ligo achieved its design sensitivity over a wide band during its fifth and sixth science runs ( s5 @xcite and s6 @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "data from s5 and s6 have been analysed in several searches for continuous wave sources in supernova remnants targeting specific , known sources like the crab pulsar @xcite , cassiopeia a @xcite , other young pulsars with radio or x - ray ephemerides @xcite , and young supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "broadband , all - sky searches have also been carried out for unknown sources , some of which may turn out post - discovery to reside in supernova remnants @xcite . although no detections resulted from these searches , upper limits",
    "have been placed on parameters of astrophysical interest , e.g. the maximum ellipticity and internal magnetic field strength of the crab pulsar @xcite and the amplitude of r - mode oscillations in cassiopeia a @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the search for periodic gravitational waves from a possible neutron star in one of the youngest and closest known supernova remnants , snr 1987a .",
    "the remnant was produced by a type ii core collapse supernova which occurred in february 1987 in the large magellanic cloud ( right ascension @xmath4 = 5h 35 m 28.03s , declination @xmath5 = @xmath669@xmath7 16@xmath8 11.79@xmath9 , distance @xmath10 kpc ) ; see reviews by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gravitational wave search relies on the semi - coherent cross - correlation algorithm @xcite , which has also been used in searches for gravitational waves from the low - mass x - ray binary sco x-1 @xcite .",
    "although the noise power spectral density of the ligo s5 run is higher than that of the first advanced ligo observation run ( o1 ) , there are strong reasons to look for gravitational waves from snr 1987a in the earlier data set .",
    "for example , the s5 run is considerably longer than o1 , and the expected gravitational - wave amplitude during s5 is larger than during o1 , given that the neutron star has aged significantly in the intervening ten years , which amount to 35 per cent of the object s age .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the evidence for a neutron star in snr 1987a and briefly review the results of previous gravitational wave searches .",
    "section iii summarizes the theory and implementation of the cross - correlation algorithm and the associated astrophysical phase model .",
    "section iv reports on the verification tests performed on synthetic data containing pure noise and injected signals and evaluates the sensitivity penalty exacted when averaging over source orientation and polarization in order to reduce computational cost . in section",
    "v , we calculate the sensitivity of the search as a function of the frequency and spin - down rate . section vi presents the results obtained from running the search on ligo s5 data and interprets the results astrophysically .",
    "no neutron star has yet been detected electromagnetically in snr 1987a , either reproducibly as a pulsar or as a nonpulsating central compact object @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , strong theoretical evidence exists for the existence of a neutron star in snr 1987a from detailed studies of the progenitor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the coincident worldwide detection of core collapse neutrinos from the supernova event @xcite .",
    "although no pulsar detection has been confirmed , numerous searches have placed upper limits on the flux and luminosity at radio ( @xmath11 @xmath12jy at 1390 mhz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , optical / near - uv ( @xmath13ergs s@xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and soft x - ray ( @xmath15 erg s@xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) wavelengths .",
    "@xcite reported finding an optical pulsar in snr 1987a with a frequency of 467.5hz , modulated sinusoidally with a @xmath16 1-ks period , consistent with precession given an ellipticity of @xmath17 .",
    "the pulsations disappeared after 1996 @xcite and were never confirmed independently .",
    "one possible reason why a pulsar has not yet been detected is that its magnetic field is too weak .",
    "the weak - field theory is supported by some theoretical models , in which the field grows after the neutron star is formed over @xmath18 yr , e.g. due to thermomagnetic effects @xcite . in a related scenario , the magnetic field of a millisecond pulsar intensifies ( linearly or exponentially ) from @xmath19 g at birth to @xmath20 g after @xmath16 0.30.7kyr ,",
    "before the pulsar spins down significantly @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the neutron star may be born with a strong magnetic field , which is amplified during the first few seconds of its life by dynamo action ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "population synthesis calculations combined with measurements of the known spin periods of isolated radio pulsars imply a distribution of birth magnetic field strengths @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 ( @xmath23 range ) @xcite .",
    "several birth scenarios for the pulsar in snr 1987a were considered by @xcite in this context , who concluded that the maximum magnetic dipole moment is @xmath24 g @xmath25 , @xmath26 g @xmath25 , and @xmath27 g @xmath25 for birth periods of 2ms , 30ms , and 0.3s respectively .",
    "the dynamo model also accommodates a magnetar in snr 1987a , with magnetic dipole moment exceeding @xmath28 g @xmath25 , regardless of the initial spin period @xcite .",
    "estimates of the birth spin of the putative pulsar in snr 1987a are more uncertain",
    ". simulations of the bounce and post - bounce phases of core collapse produce proto - neutron star spin periods between 4.7 ms and 140 ms , proportional to the progenitor s spin period @xcite .",
    "some population synthesis studies , which infer the radio pulsar velocity distribution from large - scale 0.4ghz pulsar surveys , favour shorter millisecond birth spin periods @xcite , while others argue the opposite ( @xmath29ms ; @xmath23 range ) @xcite .",
    "faint , non - pulsed x - ray emission from snr 1987a was first observed four months after the supernova and decreased steadily in 1989 @xcite , leading to the suggestion that a neutron star could be powering a plerion , which is partially obscured by a fragmented supernova envelope .",
    "a model of the plerion s x - ray spectrum , with a magnetic field of @xmath30 g and an expansion rate of @xmath31 cm s@xmath14 , fits the x - ray data for a pulsar spin period of 18ms .    despite their indirect nature ,",
    "the above studies broadly justify a search for gravitational waves from snr 1987a at frequencies from @xmath32hz to @xmath33hz ( i.e. twice the spin frequency ) , bracketing the most sensitive portion of the ligo band .",
    "the range of frequency derivative searched in this paper , namely from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , is consistent with a magnetic field between @xmath36 and @xmath37 at the present epoch and hence with the @xmath21 values above .",
    "it is also consistent with maximum ellipticity in the range @xmath38 , if the spin down is gravitational wave dominated .",
    "neither @xmath39 nor @xmath3 are known for the putative neutron star in snr 1987a , so one is unable to infer an indirect spin - down upper limit on the characteristic wave strain @xmath40 by assuming that all the observed spin - down luminosity @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the stellar moment of inertia ) goes into gravitational radiation @xcite . however , by a similar energy conservation argument , one can place an upper limit on @xmath40 in terms of the object s age , @xmath43 @xcite , viz .",
    "@xmath44    with @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath47 is the speed of light , @xmath48 is the distance to the source , @xmath49 is the braking index defined via @xmath50 ( assumed constant here for simplicity ) , @xmath51 is the spin frequency at birth , and @xmath52 is proportional to the characteristic electromagnetic spin - down time - scale @xcite .    the factor @xmath53 in equation ( [ eq : h0upperlim ] ) is normally neglected when quoting indirect limits under the assumption @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for objects like cas a but not for snr 1987a , where @xmath43 is much less than @xmath55 for many reasonable choices of birth spin and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : xi ] illustrates the point .",
    "it displays contours of @xmath53 as a function of @xmath51 and dipole magnetic field @xmath21 , assuming purely electromagnetic spin down ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) for simplicity .",
    "the spin - down model is described in more detail in section [ sec : phasemodel ] .",
    "the left panel contours ( snr 1987a ; @xmath58yr ) satisfy @xmath59 except in the top right corner of the plot ( e.g. @xmath60 , @xmath61 for @xmath62 ) .",
    "by contrast the right panel contours ( cas a ; @xmath63yr ) satisfy @xmath62 over more of the plot , as befits an older object with @xmath64 .    the indirect upper limit on @xmath40 is inversely proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "hence it is harder to reach observationally for older neutron stars .",
    "younger objects like the putative neutron star in snr 1987a generally have a higher limit on @xmath40 , although not as high as one would expect assuming @xmath65 in view of the  @xmath66 effect \" discussed above .",
    "the fact that young neutron stars with @xmath67 spin down slower than @xmath68 aids detection by reducing dramatically the number of matched filters required to track the phase evolution .",
    "the latter advantage is further discussed in section [ sec : brakingindex ] .",
    "the likely existence of a young neutron star in snr 1987a makes it a good target for gravitational wave searches @xcite .",
    "a coherent matched filtering search was carried out in 2003 with the tama 300 detector , searching @xmath69 hours of data from its first science run over a 1-hz band centered on 934.9hz , assuming a spin - down range of ( 23)@xmath70hz s@xmath14 .",
    "the search yielded an upper limit on the wave strain of @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "an earlier matched filtering search was conducted using @xmath72 hours of data taken in 1989 by the garching prototype laser interferometer .",
    "the latter search was carried out over 4-hz bands near 2khz and 4khz , did not include any spin - down parameters , and yielded a strain upper limit of @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the most sensitive gravitational wave search to date for snr 1987a was conducted with the radiometer pipeline using ligo s5 data @xcite .",
    "this search yielded an upper limit on the wave strain of @xmath74 ( 90% confidence level ) in the most sensitive frequency range near 160hz .",
    "it is noted that the radiometer analysis always assumes a circularly polarised signal , so that in a case of random polarisation like the one discussed in this paper , the equivalent radiometer strain upper limit needs to be converted to a more conservative value , by multiplying a sky position dependent factor of 2.248 @xcite . the above upper limit",
    "@xmath74 has already been converted from the original value stated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a coherent search for snr 1987a based on the optically derived @xcite spin parameters requires 30 days of integration time and at least @xmath75 search templates covering just the frequency and its first derivative @xcite .",
    "of course , the optical detection has not been confirmed independently , so one may have @xmath76hz in reality , reducing @xmath77 and hence the number of templates .",
    "nevertheless , as a rule , young objects do spin down rapidly , and five or six higher - order frequency derivatives must be searched typically in order to accurately track the gravitational wave phase . in order to sidestep this problem , @xcite proposed an astrophysically motivated phase model which describes the spin down in terms of the ellipticity , magnetic field , and electromagnetic braking index of the source instead of its frequency derivatives .",
    "the model is most useful if the braking index varies slowly during the observation , in a sense to be defined precisely in section [ sec : brakingindex ] . at the time of writing , it is unclear on astrophysical grounds whether a slowly varying braking index is favoured or disfavoured by theoretical arguments ( e.g. @xcite ) and the sparse observational data available @xcite .",
    "the theoretical basis of the cross - correlation algorithm was described in detail by @xcite . here",
    "we summarize briefly the key results that are necessary for the algorithm s implementation .",
    "the algorithm operates on interferometer data in the form of short fourier transforms ( sfts ) @xcite , usually of 30min duration .",
    "it outputs a cross - correlation detection statistic called the @xmath78 statistic .",
    "sfts are multiplied pair - wise according to some criterion ( e.g. time lag or interferometer combination ) to form a raw cross - correlation variable @xmath79 where @xmath42 and @xmath80 index the pair of sfts @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the indices of the frequency bins of the two sfts , and @xmath85 denotes the length of the sfts .",
    "the gravitational wave signal is assumed to be concentrated in a single frequency bin in each sft , i.e. @xmath86 due to sidereal motion and pulsar spin down .",
    "the frequency range spanned by the two sfts is the same , but the signal does not appear in the same frequency bin in @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the specific frequency bins with indices @xmath83 and @xmath84 multiplied in ( [ eq : yalpha ] ) are related by the time lag between the pair and between interferometers , as well as spin - down and doppler effects . for an isolated source , the instantaneous signal frequency at time @xmath89",
    "is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the instantaneous signal frequency in the rest frame of the source , @xmath92 is the detector velocity relative to the source , and @xmath93 is the unit vector pointing from the detector to the source .",
    "the instantaneous signal frequencies in sfts @xmath42 and @xmath80 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , are calculated at the times corresponding to the midpoints of the sfts , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    "the @xmath78 statistic comprises a weighted sum of @xmath101 over all pairs @xmath102 .",
    "the relative weights of the pairs in the @xmath78 statistic are controlled by the polarization amplitudes and phase of the signal and the interferometer antenna pattern .",

    "we obtain _ one _ real value of @xmath78 , which is a sum of the fourier power from all the pairs . ignoring self - correlations ( i.e.",

    "the number of pairs is limited by computational resources .",
    "summing over all possible pairs , which is normally prohibitive computationally , returns the same result as a fully coherent search .    in principle",
    ", one should search over the unknowns @xmath125 and @xmath107 when computing @xmath78 through ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "however , this adds to the already sizeable computational burden occasioned by searching over pulsar spin parameters ( see section [ sec : phasemodel ] ) , when the number of sft pairs is large .",
    "accordingly , it is customary to average over @xmath125 and @xmath107 when computing @xmath103 , assuming uniform priors on both variables .",

    "one then computes the detection statistic @xmath129 by replacing @xmath130 by @xmath131 in ( [ eq : ualpha ] ) .",
    "similarly , the mean and variance of @xmath129 can be computed by replacing @xmath103 by @xmath132 in ( [ eq : meanrho ] ) and ( [ eq : variancerho ] ) .",
    "note , importantly , that @xmath129 is not equal to @xmath133 , because @xmath101 depends implicitly on @xmath125 and @xmath107 if @xmath134 .",
    "once a first - pass search with @xmath129 is complete , a follow - up search on any promising candidates can be performed , which searches explicitly over @xmath125 and @xmath107 to achieve maximum sensitivity .",
    "tests in section [ sec : averaging ] illustrate that the detection statistic resulting from ( [ eq : galphave ] ) is approximately 10@xmath615% lower ( up to 47 % lower in rare cases ) than if the exact @xmath125 and @xmath107 values are used .      the cross - correlation algorithm in section [ sec : xcorralg ] must be accompanied by a parameterized model for the phase and frequency of the signal as functions of time , in terms of which we express the factors @xmath135 and @xmath136 in equations ( [ eqngij ] ) and ( [ eq : galphave ] ) .",
    "a target like snr 1987a raises special challenges in this regard .",
    "it is young and spins down rapidly , accumulating phase by an amount @xmath137 proportional to @xmath138 from the @xmath139 term of the taylor expansion of the phase evolution after an observation time @xmath140 .",
    "one therefore needs approximately @xmath141 templates to keep the overall phase error below @xmath142 with sft time separation @xmath143hr @xcite by tracking terms up to and including @xmath144 . as noted in section",
    "[ sec : xieffect ] , @xmath145 is suppressed strongly by the factor @xmath146 , with @xmath147 for snr 1987a .    in the special but astrophysically plausible situation where the braking index @xmath148 changes slowly with time ,",
    "one can take advantage of an alternative model for the gravitational wave phase introduced in @xcite , stated in terms of astrophysical parameters ( i.e. the magnetic field strength and the neutron star ellipticity ) instead of spin frequency derivatives .",
    "the model tracks the phase by assuming that the spin - down torque is the direct sum of gravitational - wave and electromagnetic components to a good approximation , with @xmath149 in equation ( [ eq : numodel ] ) , @xmath150 is the neutron star radius , @xmath151 is the polar magnetic field , and @xmath152 is the electromagnetic braking index . if the electromagnetic torque is proportional to a power of @xmath39 , then @xmath39 must enter the torque in the combination @xmath153 , ( i.e. the ratio of @xmath154 to the characteristic lever arm , the light cylinder distance , @xmath155 ) on dimensional grounds .",
    "hence , in terms of an arbitrary reference frequency , @xmath156 , we write @xmath157 , with @xmath158 and @xmath159 . throughout this paper",
    ", we set @xmath160hz without loss of generality .    the spin - down model ( [ eq : numodel ] ) tracks the phase in terms of four parameters : @xmath161 and @xmath152 .",
    "theoretically one expects @xmath162 for a magnetic dipole in vacuo @xcite , but observations of radio pulsars find @xmath163 @xcite , and there exist several theoretical mechanisms consistent with @xmath164 @xcite . if @xmath152 is truly constant , then phase tracking requires @xmath165 templates @xcite , and the search problem simplifies considerably .",
    "however , observations returning @xmath166 raise the spectre of @xmath152 evolving as the star spins down ; indeed the extended dipole braking model predicts @xmath167 as @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath152 evolves too rapidly , it negates the advantage of ( [ eq : numodel ] ) relative to a taylor expansion @xmath169 .",
    "this issue is quantified in section [ sec : brakingindex ] , and the parameter range where ( [ eq : numodel ] ) remains useful is determined .",

    "firstly , the user can choose to search over the gravitational wave frequency at the start of the observation , denoted by @xmath170 , and up to two frequency derivatives in the taylor expansion of the phase model ( @xmath171 ) , or use the astrophysical model described in @xcite to search over @xmath172 and @xmath152 .",
    "secondly , one can choose to target a single sky coordinate , or search within a grid of sky coordinates .",
    "thirdly , the user can choose to run the search using a particular value for the inclination and polarization angles ( @xmath108 and @xmath107 ) or average over these variables .",

    "the code loops over each search template and calculates the corresponding normalised cross - correlation statistic , @xmath78 , for each template .",
    "an important issue encountered in the implementation is the heavy use of central processing unit ( cpu ) virtual memory . when pairing up an entire year s worth of sfts ( @xmath174 sfts @xmath16 1terabyte ) , it is not feasible to load and store all the sfts in virtual memory while looping over the search templates . instead , we construct a time - ordered linked list , which contains only sfts within a sliding window of length @xmath173 , i.e. a first - in - first - out queue . the signal phase , frequency , and detector response functions are calculated at each @xmath96 .",
    "then sft pairs are constructed within the sliding window , and we loop over the search templates . for each pair ,",
    "we calculate and store the quantities @xmath175 , and @xmath176 which are defined in @xcite and section [ sec : xcorralg ] ; to simplify notation , we use the subscript @xmath4 to denote the index pair ( @xmath177 ) @xcite . as the window slides forward ,",
    "we delete the sft at the head of the linked list , add the next sfts to its tail ( as long as it satisfies the user - specified multiplication condition ) , and repeat the process .",
    "once the loop over all possible pairs is finished , the final value of the detection statistic @xmath178 for a particular search template is calculated .",

    "typically , we search up to @xmath179 templates and filter the output so that e.g. only the highest 10% of @xmath78 values are saved .",

    "figure [ fig : compare - ul ] displays the comparison among the @xmath40 upper limits with largest @xmath231 and @xmath232 ( blue solid curves ; same as red dashed curves in figure [ fig : h0_upper_limit ] ) , the @xmath40 upper limits with @xmath225 ( green dash - dot curves ) , and the theoretical sensitivity from equation ( [ eqn : theoretical_sensitivity ] ) ( red dashed curves ) .",
    "the band is separated into the same two segments as in figure [ fig : h0_upper_limit ] . for @xmath233hz , the blue curve and green curve almost overlap , because we have @xmath234hzs@xmath14 for all ( @xmath231 , @xmath232 ) , and the pipeline tracks signal phase accurately with an error @xmath235 over a year . for @xmath236hz , the difference between upper limits with largest @xmath231 and @xmath232 and upper limits with @xmath225 increases with @xmath170 .",

    "the discrepancy arises in at least two ways .",
    "first , the theoretical calculation pertains to the special case where @xmath239 and the noise floor in all sfts is the same ( see section iv in ref .",
    "@xcite and section 4.1 in ref .",
    "second , equation ( [ eqn : theoretical_sensitivity ] ) is valid under the assumption that @xmath78 is normally distributed ( i.e. all sft pairs are independent ) , which is not true in reality . from the analysis in section [ sec : noise ] , the moments of the noise - only pdf of @xmath219 agree with those of a gaussian distribution to an accuracy over 95% for @xmath240yr .",
    "hence we do not expect the latter cause to contribute more than @xmath241 to the overall discrepancy , consistent with the discrepancy between the theoretical and empirical values of @xmath242 in section [ sec : sensia ] .",
    "a more accurate statistical investigation lies outside the scope of this paper .",
    "upper limits on ellipticity @xmath243 can be deduced from the @xmath40 upper limits ( with largest @xmath231 and @xmath232 ) in figure [ fig : h0_upper_limit ] and [ fig : compare - ul ] , using the relationship between wave strain at the earth and the ellipticity of the star described in equation ( [ eqn : h0_epsilon ] ) , and are plotted in figure [ fig : epsilon - ul ] as blue curves .",
    "the dashed horizontal lines indicate the largest @xmath243 ( see table [ tab : search_para ] ) searched in each panel , with @xmath244 ( left ) and @xmath245 ( right ) .",
    "the upper limits on @xmath243 derived from @xmath40 is larger than the maximum values being searched , which indicates that the upper limits are still above the largest spin - down rate we are sensitive to .",
    "the best upper limit @xmath246 is obtained near 150hz , @xmath247 higher than the largest ellipticity being searched .",
    "in this paper , we perform a cross - correlation search for snr 1987a using the second year of ligo science run 5 data .",
    "the frequency band 75450hz is searched .",
    "six out of the total 19 first - pass candidates survive line vetoes .",
    "one out of the six second - pass candidates remains after the first stage of manual veto ( search two interferometers separately ) , but does not survive the second stage ( search first year of s5 ) . with zero survivors , a 90% confidence level upper limit is placed on the wave strain given by @xmath248 at 150hz , the most sensitive frequency , corresponding to @xmath249 .",
    "the previous most sensitive search for snr 1987a conducted with the radiometer pipeline yielded a 90 % confidence level upper limit on the wave strain of @xmath74 ( converted from the original value by the correction factor @xcite ) at the most sensitive frequency range @xcite .",
    "hence the strain upper limit yielded from our search improves on previously published result by a factor @xmath2 .    to verify the algorithm , we conduct a battery of tests on synthetic data and verify that the cross - correlation data analysis pipeline is functioning correctly for gravitational wave signals from a continuous - wave source obeying the spin - down law described by equation ( [ eq : spindownmodel_full ] ) .",
    "it is demonstrated that averaging over @xmath125 and @xmath107 sacrifices typically @xmath250 and at worst @xmath251 sensitivity while delivering computational savings .",
    "it is also shown that the electromagnetic braking index @xmath152 can be excluded from the search parameters ( by setting @xmath162 ) without sacrificing sensitivity , alleviating concerns expressed in previous work @xcite .",
    "we estimate the detection threshold and sensitivity with a group of monte - carlo tests . without spin down , the estimated strain limits are @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 for 150 , 300 , and 600hz respectively .",
    "the next step in this investigation is to search advanced ligo data , as they become available . despite a shorter observation period of 4 months for the first advanced ligo science run o1 ( i.e. a threefold reduction in @xmath184 ) ,",
    "the noise power spectral density of advanced ligo is @xmath223 times better than initial ligo . hence referring to equation ( [ eqn : theoretical_sensitivity ] )",
    ", we can expect improvement in the theoretical sensitivity @xmath255 . on the other hand ,",
    "the remnant has aged since s5 , so the expected signal amplitude is lower in o1 .",
