    "the latest elaborate observations of the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) suggest that structure formation in the universe is due to the existence of a _ superhorizon _ spectrum of curvature / density perturbations , which are predominantly adiabatic and gaussian @xcite .",
    "the best mechanism to explain such perturbations is through the amplification of the quantum fluctuations of a light scalar field during a period of inflation .",
    "moreover , inflation is to date the only compelling mechanism to account for the horizon and the flatness problems of the standard hot big bang ( shbb ) cosmology ( for a review see @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "however , despite its successes , inflation remains as yet a paradigm without a model . according to this paradigm , inflation is realised through the domination of the universe by the potential density of a light scalar field , which is slowly rolling down its almost flat potential .",
    "one of the reasons for using a flat potential is that one requires inflation to last long enough for the cosmological scales to exit the horizon during the period of accelerated expansion , so as to solve the horizon and flatness problems .",
    "this requires the inflationary period to last at least 40 e - foldings while , in most models , this number is increased to 60 or more @xcite .",
    "hence , the potential density of the field has to remain approximately constant ( to provide the effective cosmological constant responsible for the accelerated expansion ) for some time , which renders inflation with steep potentials unlikely .",
    "thus , inflation seems to require the presence of a suitable flat direction in field space .",
    "unfortunately , flat directions are very hard to attain in supergravity because khler corrections generically lift the flatness of the scalar potential .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath0-problem of inflation @xcite . to overcome this problem",
    "many authors assume that accidental cancellations minimise the khler corrections or consider directions whose flatness is protected by a symmetry other than supersymmetry , such as , for example , the heisenberg symmetry in no - scale supergravity models @xcite or a global u(1 ) for pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngbs ) ( natural inflation @xcite ) .",
    "however , accidental cancellations or no - scale supergravity require special forms for the khler potential , which have , to date , little theoretical justification .",
    "also , inflation due to a pngb suffers from other problems ; for example in the limit of unbroken u(1 ) symmetry the pngb potential vanishes .",
    "consequently , there seems to be a generic problem in realising inflation without tuning .",
    "still , there have been attempts to overcome this problem .",
    "a first step toward inflation without a flat direction was achieved by the so - called fast - roll inflation , introduced in ref .",
    "there , it has been shown that , even if the curvature of the inflaton potential is comparable to the hubble parameter , one may have inflation for a limited number of e - foldings . however , this number turns out to be rather small and appears to reduce drastically if the effective mass of the inflaton increases .",
    "hence , fast - roll inflation alone is probably not capable to explain the observations .",
    "it is possible , however , that it may assist other types of inflation , which are also incapable to last long enough .",
    "a prominent example is thermal inflation @xcite , which also does not use a flat direction but suffers from the disadvantage of requiring the presence of a thermal bath preexisting inflation , to which the inflaton is strongly coupled @xcite .",
    "recently , however , a new mechanism for inflation without a flat direction was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to this mechanism",
    ", inflation may be achieved in a hybrid - type potential ( introduced originally in the slow - roll hybrid inflation model @xcite ) , where the field s rapid oscillations keep the former onto an unstable saddle point and prevent it from rolling toward the true minima . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , such type of potentials are natural for moduli fields .",
    "unfortunately , the number of e - foldings of oscillatory inflation was found to be insufficient to solve the horizon and flatness problems . due to this fact the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite introduced a metastable local minimum in the potential , rendering their model a two - stage inflation . during the first stage of inflation",
    ", the field sits in the metastable minimum and the universe undergoes a period of so - called old inflation @xcite .",
    "this period terminates when the field tunnels out into the second stage of oscillatory inflation .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a simpler and more generic scenario for inflation without a flat direction .",
    "we point out that , in a hybrid - type non - flat potential one can have two consecutive stages of fast - roll inflation .",
    "however , if the curvature of the first stage of inflation is larger than a critical value , then this stage turns into a period of oscillatory ` locked ' inflation , which provides a lower bound on the number of e - foldings corresponding to this inflationary stage .",
    "after the first stage of inflation , it is possible to have a second period of fast - roll inflation between the time when the field leaves the unstable saddle point until it rolls to the true minimum .",
    "this second stage may last long enough to enable the total inflationary period to solve the horizon and flatness problems , without imposing stringent bounds on the curvature of the potential .",
    "the biggest obstacle for our scenario to work is the possibility of copious production of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) due to the phase transition that switches from the first stage of inflation to the second one .",
    "this danger has been already identified in @xcite .",
    "fortunately , we have found a way to circumvent the problem and avoid pbh production altogether .",
    "since our inflaton is not a light field it can not be responsible for the generation of the observed superhorizon spectrum of curvature perturbations .",
    "we , therefore , consider that these curvature perturbations are due to a curvaton field @xcite , which has no contact with the inflaton sector and can not affect in any way the inflationary dynamics .",
    "we show that it is possible to achieve the necessary e - foldings of inflation using natural values for the model parameters .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we present a simple version of non - flat , modular hybrid inflation .",
    "we show that this is a two stage inflationary model .",
    "depending on the curvature of the potential , the first stage can be a period of either fast - roll or oscillatory , ` locked ' inflation .",
    "we study in detail both cases and obtain an estimate of the number of e - foldings using natural values for the model parameters . in sec .",
    "3 we focus on the second stage of inflation , which corresponds to tachyonic fast - roll inflation , that uses the waterfall field of hybrid inflation as an inflaton .",
    "we find the number of e - foldings corresponding to this second inflationary phase and , hence , we obtain the total number of e - foldings of inflation . in sec .",
    "4 we compare the total number of e - foldings from both the stages of inflation to the e - foldings corresponding to the largest cosmological scales .",
    "thereby , we calculate the bound on the tachyonic mass of the inflaton , which ensures enough e - foldings of inflation to solve the horizon and flatness problems . in sec .",
    "5 we present a detailed analysis of the disastrous possibility of pbh production and offer a natural solution , which allows ample parameter space .",
    "in particular , we study carefully the evolution and initial conditions of both moduli during the first stage of inflation and show that , if their interaction is not too strong , it is quite possible to avoid altogether the generation of pbhs . in sec .",
    "6 we discuss other cosmological aspects of our models such as the generation of density perturbations using a curvaton field or the moduli problem .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "7 we discuss our results and present our conclusions .    throughout our paper",
    "we use natural units such that and newton s gravitational constant is , where is the reduced planck mass .",
    "consider two moduli fields , which parameterise supersymmetric flat directions ( whose flatness is lifted by supergravity corrections ) with a hybrid type of potential of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 above are taken to be real scalar fields and @xmath7 with and being the intermediate scale corresponding to gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking , where stands for the electroweak scale ( gravitino mass ) . from the above",
    "we see that the tachyonic mass of @xmath6 is given by @xmath8 and its self - coupling is suppressed gravitationally as expected , .",
    "the above potential has global minima at and an unstable saddle point at similarly to hybrid inflation ( see figure  1 ) .",

    "is evident that the larger @xmath17 is the larger @xmath26 is and , therefore , the smaller the number @xmath27 of the total e - foldings of fast - roll inflation .",
    "however , this number can not become arbitrarily small because , if @xmath17 is bigger than @xmath18 then the dynamics of @xmath5 becomes distinctly different .",
    "we explore this case in what follows .",
    "locked inflation was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a potential of the form shown in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "this kind of inflation uses an inflaton field , which is oscillating on top of the false vacuum density responsible for inflation .",
    "it turns out that , in our model , in the case when we obtain this kind of behaviour for @xmath5 .    indeed , in this case the klein - gordon eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) is solved by an equation of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31    it may strike as odd that the field is oscillating instead of rolling toward the true minimum of the system .",
    "this is because , provided the frequency of the oscillations is large enough , the time that the oscillating field spends on top of the saddle point of the potential is too small to allow its escape from the oscillatory trajectory . indeed , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) , the oscillation frequency is and the time interval that the field spends on top of the saddle point ( ) is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the amplitude of the oscillations . originally this amplitude may be quite large but the expansion of the universe dilutes the energy of the oscillations and , therefore , @xmath33 decreases , which means that @xmath34 grows . however , until @xmath34 becomes large enough to be comparable to the inverse of the tachyonic mass of @xmath6 ,",
    "the latter has no time to roll away from the saddle .",
    "hence , the oscillations of @xmath5 on top of the saddle continue until the amplitude decreases down to @xmath35 at which point @xmath6 departs from the origin and rolls down toward its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath36 . during the oscillations the density of the oscillating @xmath5 is @xmath37 comparing this with the overall potential density given in eq .",

    "( [ vinf ] ) , which remains constant as long as @xmath6 remains locked at the origin .",

    "this is what we assume for the moment in eq .",
    "( [ nfr2 ] ) .    from eqs .",

    "( [ nfr1 ] ) and ( [ nlock ] ) ] @xmath57    it is the above number @xmath58 , which needs to be compared to the necessary e - foldings for the cosmological scales .",
    "inflation solves in a single stroke the horizon and flatness problems of the standard hot big bang ( shbb ) cosmology , while providing also the superhorizon spectrum of density perturbations necessary for the formation of large scale structure . to do all these",
    ", the inflationary period has to be sufficiently long because the scales that correspond to the cosmological observations need to exit the horizon during inflation .",
    "the largest of these scales is determined by the requirements of the horizon problem and corresponds to about 100 times the scale of the present horizon .",
    "the number of e - foldings required to inflate this scale on superhorizon size provides a lower bound on the total number of e - foldings of inflation and it is estimated as follows @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the energy scale of inflation , @xmath61 is the reheat temperature , corresponding to the temperature of the thermal bath when the shbb begins after the entropy production at the end of inflation , and is the total e - foldings that correspond to any subsequent periods of inflation .",
    "the reheat temperature is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the decay rate for the inflaton field corresponding to the last stage of inflation and @xmath64 is the coupling of @xmath6 to the decay products .",

    "( [ grange ] ) and if we choose and it is easy to show that the above bound interpolates between 2 and 3 .",
    "moreover , if the mass of @xmath5 is below @xmath18 then and the bound on @xmath67 is further relaxed because @xmath71 does not need to be as large as before .",
    "consequently , it seems that , regardless of @xmath17 , the required e - foldings of inflation corresponding to the cosmological scales can be attained , only with a mild upper bound on @xmath67 .",
    "however , there is one grave danger that we had overlooked and this is the possibility of disastrous primordial black hole production due to the phase transition that terminates the first stage of inflation .",
    "we elaborate on this problem in the next section .",
    "a rather important issue to be investigated is the possibility of excessive primordial black hole ( pbh ) production after the end of inflation , when the scale , which corresponds to the phase transition that releases @xmath6 from the top of the saddle , reenters the horizon .",
    "it is well known that the outburst of tachyonic fluctuations at the phase transition can generate a mountain of density / curvature perturbations ( localised around the scale corresponding to the phase transition ) with amplitude of order unity @xcite .",
    "when these perturbations reenter the horizon and become causally connected they can collapse and form pbhs @xcite .",
    "the mass of these pbhs is of the order of the mass included in the horizon volume at the time of reentry , i.e. @xmath72 where the subscript ` pbh ' denotes the epoch of pbh formation .",
    "the probability of pbh formation is of order unity , which means that a sizable fraction of the energy density of the universe collapses into pbhs and then scales as pressureless matter .",
    "hence , just after their formation , the pbhs dominate the density of the universe and result in a period of matter domination .",
    "this period lasts until the pbhs evaporate , which occurs after time @xmath73 , where @xcite @xmath74    one of the greatest successes of the shbb is the correct prediction for the delicate abundance of the light elements .",
    "they are generated during a process called big bag nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , which takes place at temperatures , at cosmic time of about 1  sec .",
    "the bbn process is very sensitive to the state of the universe at the time .",
    "consequently , it is imperative that the shbb has begun before bbn occurs .",
    "therefore , the pbhs must evaporate before bbn , i.e. .",
    "this requirement results in a constraint on @xmath75 , which reads @xmath76 to calculate the value of @xmath75 we use the fact that the formation of the pbhs occurs when the scale that corresponds to the phase transition , reenters the horizon . since this scale exits the horizon @xmath71 e - foldings before the end of inflation , it is easy to find @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the scale factor of the universe , the subscript ` inf ' here denotes the end of inflation and we used eq .",

    "( [ grange ] ) , interpolates between between 1.5 and 1.8 .",
    "hence , it is evident that enough inflation to satisfy the cosmological observations can be achieved with @xmath123 i.e. without the use of a flat direction .",
    "hence , we have shown that _",
    "the combination of locked and fast - roll inflation is capable of providing enough e - foldings of inflation to encompass the cosmological scales without the use of any flat direction_. note that the bound in eq .",
    "( [ mphiboundeg ] ) is further relaxed if as can be seen in figure  3 .    now , regarding the catastrophic possibility of pbh production , eq .",
    "( [ lnbeg ] ) , in the case when , gives @xmath124 which means that @xmath6 is always safely away from the origin so that the tachyonic fluctuations never dominate its motion and , consequently , _ there is no excessive production of perturbations and no pbh formation .",
    "_ if , then and @xmath96 is reduced , but , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ lnbeg ] ) , it is always greater than unity .",
    "in total we have shown that _ there is ample parameter space in which pbh production is avoided while enough inflation is achieved without the use of flat directions_. however , there are more requirements to be met for a successful cosmology .",
    "we discuss the most important of them in the following section .",
    "there are more to inflation than the solution of the horizon and flatness problems .",
    "in particular inflation has to provide also the spectrum of superhorizon density / curvature perturbations which causes the observed cmbr anisotropy and seeds the formation of large scale structure in the universe . the superhorizon spectrum of perturbations is thought to be generated by the amplification of the quantum fluctuations of a light field , i.e. a field whose mass is smaller than @xmath125 .",
    "this is because only if the compton wavelength of the field is larger than the horizon during inflation , can the quantum fluctuations of the field reach and exit the horizon , thereby giving rise to the desired generation of a superhorizon perturbation spectrum .",
    "this is a rather generic requirement , which seems to call for the use of at least one flat direction in inflation .",
    "traditionally , it was thought that the field responsible for the generation of the superhorizon curvature perturbations is the inflaton field .",
    "however , this is possible only if the inflaton is effectively massless , i.e. only if .",
    "this is in conflict with our aim in this paper , which is to achieve inflation without the use of flat directions , which means that , for our inflaton , .",
    "consequently an alternative solution must be found .",
    "there are a number of recent proposals on this issue in the literature .",
    "for example , in ref .  @xcite it is assumed that @xmath6 is coupled to some other field @xmath126 in a way , which does not affect the inflationary scenario but does affect the inflaton decay rate @xmath127 .",
    "the latter is thought to be perturbed on superhorizon scales because @xmath126 is assumed to be an appropriately light field .",
    "this mechanism was recently introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and , even though quite interesting , it suffers from the fact that we require our moduli inflatons to possess the appropriate coupling to the appropriate field , which should be large enough to generate the required perturbations but not too large because it should not lift the flatness of the @xmath126 direction .",
    "it seems , therefore , that this mechanism needs a few special requirements to work .",
    "this is against our philosophy , which aims to address the problems of inflation model  building in the most generic and natural way possible .",
    "fortunately there is another way to obtain the required curvature perturbations .",
    "recently it has been suggested that the generation of these superhorizon perturbations could be entirely independent of the inflaton field .",
    "indeed , according to this proposal the curvature perturbation spectrum is due to the superhorizon perturbations of some `` curvaton '' field @xmath128 @xcite . as usual",
    ", this field must be a light field during inflation .",
    "its energy density during inflation is negligible and , therefore , has no effect on the inflationary dynamics .",
    "after the end of inflation , however , the field becomes important and manages to dominate ( or nearly dominate ) the energy density , imposing thereby its own curvature perturbation onto the universe .",
    "afterwards , it decays into the thermal bath of the shbb .",
    "the existence of a curvaton field substantially ameliorates the constraints imposed by observations onto inflation model - building @xcite .",
    "indeed , the only requirement that the curvaton imposes onto inflation is that the inflaton itself does not generate excessive curvature perturbations . in our case , though , there is no such danger because our inflatons are not light fields and , therefore , they do not produce any sizable superhorizon curvature perturbations , because their quantum fluctuations are exponentially suppressed before reaching the horizon during inflation .",
    "the curvaton is generally expected to produce a quite flat superhorizon spectrum of curvature perturbations , which is in good agreement with the recent wmap observations that suggest for the spectral index . however , the predictions of the curvaton depend on the evolution of the field after the end of inflation , which has been thoroughly investigated in a recent paper of one of us , with collaborators @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if the curvaton decays before it dominates the universe it may generate a substantial isocurvature component on the perturbation spectrum , correlated with the adiabatic mode , which may soon become observable by the planck satellite . also , it is possible to obtain sizable non - gaussianity that may be constrained or detected by the sdss or the 2df galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the curvaton is that , since it is independent of the physics of inflation , it can be associated with much lower energy scales than @xmath60 . in particular , it may well be associated with tev physics , and can be a field already present in simple extensions of the standard model .",
    "indeed , physics beyond the standard model provides a large number of curvaton candidates such as , a right - handed sneutrino @xcite , used for generating the neutrino masses , the peccei - quinn field @xcite , which solves the strong cp problem , various flat directions of the mssm @xcite , or of the nmssm @xcite , a pngb @xcite ( e.g. a wilson line or a string axion ) and a string modulus @xcite to name but some .",
    "the fact that the shbb must have already begun before bbn takes place sets a lower bound on @xmath61 for any inflationary model .",
    "this bound translates into a bound on @xmath127 [ cf .",
    "( [ treh ] ) ] which , in turn , becomes a bound on @xmath64 of eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) .",
    "indeed , demanding , we find that bbn constrains @xmath64 as follows : @xmath129 thus , we see that almost the entire range in eq .",
    "( [ range ] ) escapes the above bound .",
    "there is a problem only if @xmath6 decays through gravitational couplings , in which case .",
    "this is the well known moduli problem .",
    "a typical solution to this problem involves the introduction of an additional brief period of thermal inflation @xcite , which dilutes the moduli and produces additional entropy , which enables the shbb to commence earlier than bbn .",
    "this period of thermal inflation may occur during the inflaton s coherent oscillations , before reheating is completed .",
    "typically , thermal inflation may last up to 20 e - foldings .",
    "this means that , in eq .",
    "( [ ncosmo ] ) , the term @xmath130 would be non zero , but equal to the number of e - foldings of thermal inflation . when the upper bound on @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ finbound ] ) is relaxed .",
    "for example , with  and , putting \\ { } relaxes the bound on the ratio of [ cf .",
    "( [ mphiboundeg ] ) ] up to 5 \\{9}. for it can be shown that there is no need for a second stage of fast - roll inflation and @xmath67 can be very large as shown in figure  4 .",
    "using a rather generic form for their scalar potential , we have shown that moduli fields , corresponding to flat directions of supersymmetry , whose flatness is lifted by supergravity corrections , can naturally generate enough e - foldings of inflation to solve the horizon and the flatness problems of the standard hot big bang ( shbb ) .",
    "indeed , using natural values for the parameters ( masses of order tev and vacuum energy of the order of the intermediate scale , corresponding to gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking ) and a hybrid - type potential we have found that the moduli give rise to two - stage inflation whose total duration may well be long enough to encompass the cosmological scales . depending on the curvature of the potential the first stage of inflation may be a period of fast - roll inflation or of oscillatory inflation , when the system is ` locked ' on top of an unstable saddle point corresponding to non - zero vacuum density .",
    "this is followed by a second stage of tachyonic fast - roll inflation , when the system rolls toward the true vacuum .",
    "our calculations have demonstrated that , with a quite mild upper bound on the tachyonic mass of the inflaton , we can achieve enough e - foldings of inflation without employing slow roll at all . that way inflation can escape from the famous @xmath0-problem , since we manage to have masses of order the hubble parameter without problem .",
    "probably the most difficult obstacle to the success of our scenario is the possibility of copious generation of of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) .",
    "they may be generated due to excessive tachyonic fluctuations at the phase transition , which terminates the first stage of inflation .",
    "we have studied this problem in detail and showed that , if the pbhs do form then it is impossible to return to the shbb cosmology in time for bbn .",
    "the only solution is , therefore , to avoid creating the pbhs in the first place . by considering the initial conditions of @xmath6 more carefully and by following its evolution during the first stage of inflation",
    "we have demonstrated that it is indeed possible to prevent it from being , at the time of the phase transition , under the influence of excessive tachyonic fluctuations , which would lead to pbh production .",
    "instead , we have shown that , with natural initial conditions , one can avoid the pbhs provided @xmath89 is not very large ( at most ) , i.e. the interaction between the moduli is suppressed .",
    "this is quite likely for moduli fields away from enhanced symmetry points ( especially if the coupling is controlled by the planck  suppressed vev of some other field ) .",
    "note , also , that avoiding the pbhs in the way we propose also dispenses with another potential danger ; that of generating cosmologically catastrophic topological defects at the phase transition .",
    "for example , were it otherwise , it would be possible to generate stable domain walls , which would disastrously dominate the universe .",
    "still , one can consider more complicated theories where such defects are unstable or harmless ( e.g. cosmic strings at the energy scale @xmath131 have little cosmological consequences ) .",
    "structure formation , in our model , is due to the existence of a curvaton field , which is unrelated to the moduli inflatons and , consequently , it can neither affect the dynamics of inflation nor does it have to be tuned accordingly to avoid this danger .",
    "the curvaton _ must _ be a flat direction because there is no known way to obtain the superhorizon spectrum of density perturbations required by the observations , other than inflating the vacuum fluctuations of a light scalar field .",
    "however , since the curvaton is not related with the inflationary expansion , it can be protected by some symmetry , which may even be exact during inflation ( e.g. a global u(1 ) for a pngb curvaton ) . moreover",
    ", the curvaton can be associated with low energy ( tev ) physics and can be easily accommodated in simple extensions of the standard model .    as discussed also in ref .",
    "@xcite the potential landscape for the moduli fields is expected to allow a cascade of periods of oscillatory , ` locked ' inflation . completing this picture",
    "we add that , between those periods , we can easily have periods of fast - roll inflation when the system is rolling from one saddle point to another .",
    "that way the total number of e - foldings can be much larger than the one corresponding to the cosmological scales .",
    "of course one needs a roughly flat region of the universe to start up with , but this is a generic initial condition problem for inflation .",
    "this work shows that , at least , the other generic problem of inflation , namely the @xmath0-problem , can be naturally overcome .",
