    "standard @xcite and loop @xcite quantum cosmology heavily depends on the implicit assumption of ( quantum ) stability of general form of the metric . as a principal starting point in quantum cosmology ,",
    "one usually chooses a metric of a particular ( more or less symmetric ) form . in the simplest , homogeneous and isotropic case ,",
    "the metric chosen is the ( flat ) friedmann ",
    "lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) one .",
    "consequently , ( field theory ) quantum gravity reduces to a much more tractable quantum mechanical system with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is obvious that such an approach greatly simplifies quantum analysis of cosmological evolution , but under no circumstances is it obvious to what extent is such an approach reliable .",
    "the quantum cosmology approach could be considered unreliable when ( for example ) the assumed symmetry of the metric would be unstable due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "more precisely , in the context of the stability , one can put forward the two , to some extent complementary , issues ( questions ) : ( 1 ) assuming a small anisotropy in the almost isotropic cosmological model , have quantum fluctuations a tendency to increase the anisotropy or , just the opposite , to reduce it ? ( 2 ) assuming we start quantum evolution from an exactly isotropic metric should be we sure that no quantum fluctuations are able to perturb the isotropy ?    in this letter , we are going to address the both issues of the quantum stability of spacetime metric in the framework of standard covariant quantum gravity .",
    "namely , in section 2 , we address the first stability issue for an anisotropic ( homogeneous ) metric of the kasner type , to one loop in perturbative expansion . in section 3 , we give a simple , formal argument , not limited to one loop , concerning the second issue .",
    "the approach applied in this section is a generalization of our approach used in @xcite in the context of flrw geometry . in our present work ,",
    "the starting point is an anisotropic ( homogeneous ) metric ,    @xmath0    of the kasner type , i.e.    @xmath1    where @xmath2 are the kasner exponents .",
    "one should stress that we ignore any assumptions concerning matter content , and consequently , no prior bounds are imposed on @xmath2 .    in the perturbative approach @xmath3 then @xmath4 where @xmath5 , with @xmath6the newton gravitational constant .",
    "the quantized field @xmath7 is small , as expected , closely to the expansion ( reference ) point @xmath8 . using the gauge freedom to satisfy the harmonic gauge condition ( see , the second formula in @xmath9 ) , we gauge transform the gravitational field @xmath10 as follows , @xmath11 where the gauge parameter @xmath12 then ,    @xmath13    and , skipping the prime for simplicity , we have @xmath14 where spacetime indices are being manipulated with the minkowski metric @xmath15 .",
    "now , we should switch from our present @xmath10 to standard perturbative gravitational variables , i.e.  to the `` barred '' field @xmath16 defined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 the fourier transform of @xmath16 is @xmath19 where , for the @xmath20 of the explicit form @xmath21 , we have ( from now on , we denote classical gravitational fields with the superscript `` c '' ) @xmath22 according to @xmath23 a one - loop quantum contribution corresponding to the classical metric @xmath24 equals    @xmath25_{\\mu\\nu}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & 2\\pi\\kappa^{2}\\omega^{2}\\log\\left|\\frac{\\omega}{\\lambda}\\right|\\delta^{3}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\,\\textrm{diag}\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\tilde{h^{\\mathrm{c}}},\\alpha_{1}\\tilde{h_{i}^{\\mathrm{c}}}-\\left(\\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{2}\\right)\\tilde{h^{\\mathrm{c}}}\\right).\\label{eq : hqprzezdiaghc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    defining the auxiliary function @xmath26 we have @xmath27    ]    its fourier reverse is @xmath28,\\label{eq : hqtjawnie}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the digamma function , and according to @xmath30 @xmath31 performing the gauge transformation in the spirit of @xmath32 we can remove the first ( time ) component in @xmath33 , and ( once more , skipping the prime for simplicity ) we get a quantum contribution to the kasner metric @xmath34 only the `` anisotropic '' part of @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 can influence the anisotropy of the evolution of the universe .",
    "since the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath38 is purely `` diagonal '' ( @xmath37 depends only on @xmath38 with @xmath39 , see @xmath40 ) , we have the following simple rule governing ( de)stabilization of the isotropy : the increasing function @xmath41 implies destabilization ( there is a greater contribution of quantum origin to the metric in the direction of a greater classical expansion ) , whereas the decreasing function implies stabilization .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath42 is not a monotonic function because the digamma function @xmath29 oscillates , and moreover @xmath40 is ( in general - cutoff independent for @xmath43 ( a limit in @xmath40 exists ) , i.e.  for pure radiation ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "intuitively , it could be explained by the fact that a scale - independent classical source , the photon field , implies vanishing of scale - dependent logarithms ( no quantum `` anomaly '' ) .",
    "] ) a @xmath44-cutoff dependent function .",
    "nevertheless , if we assume the point of view that it is not necessary to expect or require the stability of the isotropy in the whole domain of the kasner exponents @xmath2 , but only for some subset of them , considered physically preferred , a definite answer emerges .",
    "since @xmath45 corresponds to radiation , and @xmath46 corresponds to matter , we could be fully satisfied knowing that @xmath42 is monotonic in the interval @xmath47(@xmath48 $ ] ) . furthermore , since @xmath49 for any spin ( see , table [ tab : tabela ] ) , @xmath42 is a decreasing function in this interval , implying ( quantum ) damping of the anisotropy ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : rysunek ] ) .",
    "section 2 has been limited to one - loop perturbative analysis of the stability of isotropy of cosmological evolution .",
    "but one can give a simple , formal argument ensuring stability of the `` exactly isotropic '' expansion , i.e. for @xmath50 which is perturbative but not limited to one loop , making use of @xmath51 , where now @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the full propagator and the full vacuum polarization , respectively . since @xmath54 no spatial coordinate @xmath55 is singled out in @xmath56 , and consequently no spatial coordinate can be singled out on lhs of @xmath51 .",
    "this argument is only of purely formal interest as any other fluctuations can destabilize the isotropy .",
    "recapitulating , as far as perturbative quantum gravity in one - loop approximation is concerned we have observed that in a ( hopefully ) physically preferred region of the kasner exponents @xmath57 we should expect damping of anisotropy by quantum fluctuations , thus supporting reliability of the approach of quantum cosmology in this regime .",
    "one should point out that this result is subjected to several limitations .",
    "first of all , since @xmath58 should be small , @xmath59 should be close to @xmath8 because of @xmath21 .",
    "but for @xmath60 , by virtue of @xmath33 , we have @xmath61 therefore , to stay in the perturbative regime , @xmath8 should be greater than @xmath62 , and we have to be away from the ( primordial ) classical singularity .",
    "instead , for @xmath8 many orders greater than @xmath62 , according to @xmath63 the quantum contribution becomes small , and moreover classical matter ( including radiation ) is expected to begin to play a role . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the effects of viscosity in the radiation and pressure from collisionless radiation ensure isotropization ( and stability ) of cosmological evolution at late times .",
