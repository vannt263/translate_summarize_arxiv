    "we provide a short review of the first seven years of observing with the taurus tunable filter at the aat ; for the first three years , the ttf was also used at the wht .",
    "the instrument has had most of its use on the aat where it gets between 1015% of the telescope time scheduled by the patt ( uk ) and atac ( australia ) committees . in a nutshell",
    ", the ttf allows for wide - field ( 10@xmath2 ) spectrophotometric imaging from 370 nm to 1000 nm with resolving powers generally in the range 100 to 1000 .",
    "an important feature of the instrument is the use of charge shuffling synchronized to band switching in order to greatly suppress systematic errors associated with conventional imaging .",
    "another aspect of the ttf is time series readout coupled to band switching which has lead to important new work on compact variable sources .",
    "technical accounts of the instrument , and its related charge shuffling modes , can be found in appendices a and b.    there have been several recent reviews on tunable filters including bland - hawthorn ( 2000@xmath3 ) , jones ( 2001@xmath4 ) and jones  ( 2001 ) .",
    "recent scientific reviews can be found in veilleux  ( 2002 ) and veilleux ( 2002@xmath3 ) .",
    "a list of largely unexplored science areas with tunable filters is given in bland - hawthorn  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the purpose of this review is to stress the versatility of tunable filters in observational astronomy .",
    "the taurus focal reducer has also produced important results in its other modes of operation ( see appendix a ) : polarimetry , fabry - perot ` staring ' and emission line scanning , and most recently multi - object spectroscopy ( e.g. riddick , lucas & roche 2003 ) .",
    "but here we concentrate specifically on the ttf mode of operation .",
    "all observations discussed here were undertaken on 4 m telescopes , often in non - ideal observing conditions .",
    "these authors eagerly anticipate the tunable filters which are planned or under way for the new generation optical / ir telescopes on superb sites .",
    "these include , inter alia , the osiris tunable filter on the grantecan 10.2 m telescope ( cepa  2002 ) , a possible tunable filter within fors on the vlt , the proposed maryland magellan tunable filter ( mmtf ) , and the tunable filter within the goodman spectrograph on the soar 4 m telescope .",
    "when one reviews the results below , it is important to keep in mind that the new generation of tunable filters need only improve on one of the following  site conditions , instrument performance , field of view , pixel sampling , telescope aperture  to achieve a major gain .",
    "tunable filters are ideally suited to surveys of star forming galaxies in different environments .",
    "the object selection is based on the property we are trying to measure ,  the star formation rate via the  line .",
    "this was the principle behind the ttf field galaxy survey which was the basis of d.h .",
    "jones thesis ( 2001 ) .",
    "he obtained photometric  data and restricted data on 4 clusters and 9 field positions .",
    "all observations were highly successful in identifying line emitting galaxies , typically @xmath5 objects above @xmath6 per pointing ( although rather fewer in ) , finding many more objects than comparable studies with conventional imaging techniques (  hu & mcmahon 1996 ; thommes  1998 ) .",
    "the first part of ttf field galaxy survey was published in jones & bland - hawthorn ( 2001 ) .",
    "recent evidence suggests a decline in the volume - averaged star formation rate ( sfr ) with the advance of cosmic time since @xmath7 .",
    "the survey set out to derive  luminosity functions in three discrete wavelength intervals at @xmath8 , 0.24 , and 0.39 .",
    "one of the interesting surprises was the discovery of a population of compact sources found to have moderate amounts of  emission : some of these sources would have been dismissed as stars in earlier photographically selected surveys .",
    "the ttf field galaxy survey measures volume - averaged star formation rates at intermediate redshift that are a factor of @xmath9 times higher than those measured from multi - slit or multi - fibre surveys .",
    "since these results have been largely confirmed by the cadis emission line survey ( hippelein et al 2003 ) and the subaru emission line survey ( fujita et al 2003 ) , it is likely that the restricted apertures of fibres and slits have underestimated the total h@xmath10 line flux at low redshift .    in a new study of galaxies in the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) , tresse  ( 2002 )",
    "combine the ttf field galaxy survey measurements with their isaac / vlt  luminosity function at @xmath7 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "they find that the comoving  luminosity density increases by a factor of 12 from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "their results confirm a strong rise of the star formation rate at @xmath13 proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "tober  ( 2003 ; see also glazebrook 1997 ) carried out a deep survey of 20 square arcminutes in the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) using the taurus tunable filter and william herschel telescope ( wht ) to observe in contiguous sequences of narrow band slices in the 710@xmath15910 nm region of the spectrum .",
    "these authors sampled almost 70 narrowband images in four redshift intervals . in this way",
    ", one gets a _ multiplicity effect _ in that the same images can be used to find different sources at different redshifts , thereby allowing for a derivation of the star formation rate over a wide range in redshift .",
    "the data , which were taken during four long dark nights at the wht , have excellent image quality with psf @xmath16 0.7  fwhm after combining the full data set .",
    "cross - matching with keck spectroscopy of the hdf - n results in a line - luminosity limited sample , with very highly complete redshift identification , containing oii ,  and  emitters over the @xmath17 . from this direct star - formation rate selected sample",
    "they reconstruct , via maximum likelihood techniques , the star - formation history of the universe to @xmath18 .",
    "their study finds no evidence for any new population of low - luminosity strong - lined objects to an approximate flux limit of @xmath19 w m@xmath20 and covering a cosmological volume of 1000 mpc@xmath21 at @xmath18 . from their complete narrow - band sample of a single sight line ,",
    "tober  find a star - formation history consistent with earlier estimates from broad - band selected samples .",
    "2.7 in    2.7 in      until now , identifying the majority of cluster members from a combination of kinematics and a colour - magnitude diagram has been difficult , particularly for blue objects , due to contamination of sightline galaxies . but ttf observations can be used to identify faint cluster members unambiguously , in particular those with line emission .",
    "these objects are typically blue so the ttf is an ideally suited to unscrambling the region of contamination ( see fig .",
    "2(_right _ ) ) .",
    "we find that k@xmath22a galaxies ( dressler & gunn 1983 ) can also be identified from  absorption ( jones & bland - hawthorn 1999 , fig .  1 ) .    in fig",
    ", we demonstrate the power of ttf to find line emitters even in poor seeing ( 2@xmath23 ) .",
    "dalcanton ( 1996 ) and zaritsky  ( 1997 ) use ccd drift scanned images to identify clusters through enhanced surface brightness fluctuations out to @xmath24 .",
    "for one cluster at @xmath25 , in just 2 hours , we identified 10 cluster members at the aat in 2  seeing , compared to 6 members in 1.5 nights using the keck lris spectrograph .",
    "for the rich cluster a3665 ( ac 106 ) , first studied by couch & newell ( 1984 ) , zaritsky & jones identify 40  emitting candidates above 3@xmath26 , with many more candidates at lower thresholds ( down to 0.03 solar masses per year at @xmath27 ) , in just four hours .",

    "3(_right _ ) , with the  line profiles in fig .",
    "3(_left _ ) .    to date",
    ", average star formation rates in @xmath28 clusters appear to be quite low compared to the field ( cf .",
    "couch  2001 ) .",
    "baker  ( 2001 ) used the [ oii]372.7 nm line to detect starforming galaxies in the vicinity of mrc b0450 - 221 .",
    "many emission line galaxies can be visible over the whole field ( down to a few solar masses per year ) .",
    "their projected separations from the quasar range from 200 to 700 kpc .",
    "a nice demonstration of the power of ttf imaging is the detection of very faint extended [ oii ] emission along the radio axis of the quasar .",
    "francis  ( 2001@xmath4,@xmath29 ) have continued their study of the ` francis cluster ' , an extended ensemble of galaxies at @xmath30 that was originally identified from the damped ly@xmath10 absorption occurring at the same redshift in a paired quasar sightline . in this study , they look for ly@xmath10 emission from star forming galaxies within the ensemble .",
    "it is clear that the future holds great promise for using quasars to identify gas - rich starforming environments at high redshift .",
    "there have been claims of euv excesses in clusters which , if true , would suggest that 10@xmath31k gas accounts for a large fraction of missing baryons ( lieu  1999 ; bowyer  1999 ) .",
    "euv emission is exceedingly difficult to detect at earth : it is too hot to be detected optically , too cool to be seen by x - ray satellites , and undergoes molecular line absorption as it propagates through the ism .    using the euve satellite , lieu  ( 1999 ) claim a direct euv detection of the cluster abell 1795 .",
    "maloney & bland - hawthorn ( 2001 ) found that such a strong euv field would ionize the molecular and hi disks of all spirals in the cluster to such an extent that they should all be  bright .",
    "ttf observations of the cluster were kindly taken by a. edge in ` straddle shuffle ' ( maloney & bland - hawthorn 2001 ) mode in order to subtract the continuum light of the cluster very accurately .",
    "only very faint  emission was found in the cluster spirals .",
    "jaffe & bremer ( 2000 ) used ` on - off ' charge shuffling in order to detect very faint levels of  emission in cooling flow clusters . in the case of abell 2597",
    ", they find a nebula extending over 50@xmath1560 kpc from the cluster centre .",
    "a. edge and collaborators have looked at a large sample of cooling flow clusters and detect optical line emission in all cases .",
    "tunable filters are ideally suited to observe extended sources , in particular , irregularly shaped sources with no axis of symmetry .",
    "earlier work with d.h .",
    "jones on star formation in clusters occasionally turned up spectacular gravitational lenses throughout the cluster .",
    "as seen through the ttf , these sources can have high contrast because the background object is commonly a high - redshift starforming galaxy which emits strongly in emission lines .",
    "hewett  ( 2000 ) used the ttf to detect extended emission in a galaxy - galaxy gravitational lens due to an intermediate redshift elliptical lensing a @xmath32 star forming galaxy .",
    "they were following up a suggestion by miralde - escud & lehar ( 1992 ) that the surface density of high - redshift starforming galaxies is so high , galaxy - galaxy lensing should be relatively common .",
    "the tunable filter has the major advantage of providing detailed spectrophotometric information over a larger field of view ( fov ) than that of other 3d instruments .",
    "it would be very difficult    and very expensive to build an integral field spectrograph which could provide the same field and the same photometric integrity at low light levels .",
    "the tunable filter is therefore ideally suited to study nearby galaxies where the line - emitting gas extends over several arcminutes .",
    "this ionized material is an excellent probe of the phenomena taking place in the core of starburst and active galaxies , and can be used to quantify the impact of nuclear and star - formation activity on the environment and vice - versa . once again , the reader is encouraged to look at recent reviews by veilleux ( 2002@xmath3 ) .",
    "tadhunter and collaborators have undertaken a comprehensive survey of extended ionized haloes around powerful radio galaxies ( tadhunter2000 ; solorzano - inarrea  2002 ; solorzano - inarrea & tadhunter 2003 ) .",
    "it is well known that optical line emission often aligns with the radio axis , as these authors find in all cases .",
    "however more surprising was the frequency of optical emission perpendicular to the radio axis . in fig .  4",
    ", the optical emission in coma a extends over more than 150 kpc in an egg - shaped nebula ( tadhunter  2000 ) .",
    "more remarkably , the faint outer nebula emission matches the extended outer radio lobe over these same scales .",
    "the frequent match - up between optical , radio and x - ray emission in radio galaxies , seyfert and starburst galaxies is a topic of great interest ( see below ) . in the case of low power radio jets ,",
    "the emission is thought to arise from sychrotron , whereas in high power radio jets , the x - rays appear to arise from inverse compton emission ( birkinshaw  2001 ) .",
    "shopbell  ( 1999 ) recently published a remarkable extended nebula surrounding the x - ray selected quasar , mr  2251 - 178 .",
    "the summed image in fig .",
    "5 is one of the faintest extended emission - line images ever published .",
    "the nebula , which extends over more than 200  kpc , shows pronounced tidal arm structure .",
    "these authors chose two narrow bands spaced by half a bandwidth in order to study the kinematics .",
    "the entire structure appears to be in rotation about the quasar .",
    "the gas is not obviously connected with any other companions in the field .",
    "uv radiation from the quasar would have to be escaping almost isotropically to account for the ionization .",
    "both the source of the gas and the source of ionization remain a mystery .",
    "seyfert galaxies often show the impact of the nuclear activity on the very large scale disk of a spatially resolved galaxy in the near field .",
    "two of the most recent and spectacular examples are ngc 1068 and ngc 7213 .",
    "can we use the ism as a screen to interpret what is essentially unresolved and unseen at the core ?",
    "ngc 1068 is one of the most remarkable of seyfert galaxies in the near field .",
    "it is well known that the core harbours a concealed seyfert 1 ( ` low power quasar ' ) nucleus , but just how energetic is the source ?",
    "the radio jet axis exhibits a wide range of activity ( cecil  2002 ) but can we infer the true energetics and nuclear spectrum from multi - wavelength studies ( alexander  2000 ; pier & krolik 1993 ) ?",
    "shopbell  ( 2001 ; see also veilleux  2001 ) find that the well known ionization cone ( pogge 1988 ) extends up to and _ beyond _ the hi edge of the early - type spiral .",
    "the observed nebula requires rather special conditions to be detectable over such a huge extent .",
    "the most likely interpretation is that a multi - phase , vertically distended ism is being blasted by a very energetic central source ( @xmath33 erg s@xmath34 ) .",
    "indeed , the chandra observations appear to show the most spectacular example to date of an ` x - ray ionization cone ' ( young  2001 ) .",
    "these galaxy - scale ionization cones are not unique to ngc 1068 .",
    "another has been detected with the ttf in ngc 7213 ( rupke  2002 ; veilleux2001 ) to rival the spectacular system in ngc 5252 studied by tadhunter & tsvetanov ( 1989 ) .",
    "ionization cones are often associated with nuclear jets .",
    "recent examples from ttf observations include ic 5063 ( cecil  2001 ) and circinus ( veilleux & bland - hawthorn 1997 ) .",
    "circinus , a large spiral close to the galactic plane , is particularly noteworthy : the system shows evidence for a whole network of ` artillery shells ' blasting away from the nucleus .",
    "one such filament shows a spectacular ` herbig haro'-like morphology .",
    "extended ionization cones are seen in a variety of sources , including the radio galaxies studied by tadhunter ( see above ) .",
    "one of us has obtained a short exposure [ oiii ] image of cen a using the straddle shuffle mode in order to achieve a clean subtraction of the elliptical galaxy . in fig .",
    "6 , we find a very highly ionized halo of [ oiii ] emission above and below the dust lane .",
    "the component was first discovered by phillips  ( 1984 ) who found that the faint emission appeared to rotate slowly compared to the dust lane , and typical line dispersions are hundreds of  fwhm .",
    "we suspect that this emission arises from a highly ionized wind which encompasses the radio jet over a much larger solid angle .",
    "cecil  ( 2000 ) show that the famous braided jets in ngc 4258 , which can be traced over 10 kpc or more , emanate from the nuclear regions .",
    "these jets have been seen in radio continuum , rosat / chandra x - rays , and optical emission .",
    "they obtained deep  observations in the outer hi disk which gave the first detailed picture of faint tendrils of the jets .",
    "a re - analysis of the radio continuum data has revealed that these faint features have radio counterparts .",
    "the ngc 1068 and ngc 4258 observations were able to detect faint emission unseen previously with less sensitive imaging .",
    "it is important to realize that both observations were taken within 20of the full moon , _ which demonstrates the effectiveness of the ttf in any phase of the lunar cycle .",
    "_    a number of powerful starburst galaxies show evidence for large - scale winds along their minor axis ( see reviews by veilleux  2001 and heckman 2002 ) .",
    "this phenomenon appears to be common at low and high redshift ( lehnert & heckman 1996 ; veilleux  2001 ; pettini  2001 ) .",
    "the most detailed studies have concentrated on objects like m82 , ngc 253 and ngc 3079 .",
    "it remains unclear just how much energy , mass and metals these objects contribute to the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . in some cases ,",
    "it is not clear if the wind is driven by a central starburst , an agn or a combination of these .",
    "however there is mounting evidence that the optical diagnostics may greatly underestimate the true wind energetics ( strickland & stevens 2000 ) .",
    "veilleux & rupke ( 2002 ) provide spectacular evidence for a large - scale wind in the edge on , early type galaxy ngc 1482 .",
    "they obtain a clear separation of disk material from the outflowing gas .",
    "the kinematics show all the hallmarks of a biconal outflow .",
    "more impressively , the entire emission line complex has diagnostics which are entirely consistent with fast shocks . in other wind systems",
    ", there is often a large contribution from the central ionizing stellar radiation field .",
    "more recently , veilleux  ( 2003 ) have presented results of a pilot imaging study of 10 nearby starburst and active galaxies conducted with the ttf on the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "an important goal of this study was to search for warm emission - line gas on scales larger than @xmath35 10 kpc to constrain the zone of influence of these galaxies .",
    "large - scale structures are discovered or confirmed in four of the galaxies ( ngc  1068 , ngc  1482 , ngc  4388 , ngc  6240 , and ngc  7213 ) .",
    "unsuspected structures are also seen for the first time in the galactic winds of ngc  1365 , ngc  1705 , circinus , and eso484-g036 .",
    "the ttf data are combined with new optical long - slit spectra as well as published and archived radio and x - ray maps to constrain the origin and source of ionization of these filaments .",
    "a broad range of phenomena is observed , including large - scale ionization cones and galactic winds , tidal interaction , and ram - pressure stripping by an intracluster medium .      for his thesis work ,",
    "miller ( 2002 ) has undertaken an emission line survey of edge - on spiral galaxies in order to trace the connection of disk star formation with activity in galactic haloes .",
    "miller & veilleux ( 1999 ) and veilleux  ( 2001 ) show spectacular examples of diffuse ionized gas several kiloparsecs off the plane of normal spirals .",
    "the ratio maps show enhanced [ nii ] emission with respect to  as we move away from the plane which is most easily explained as a higher electron temperature in the halo gas ( cf .",
    "sokolowski 1993 ; reynolds  1999 ; collins & rand 2001 ) .",
    "the source of the temperature increase is a topic of debate in contemporary astrophysics .",
    "miller & veilleux ( 2003@xmath3 ) confirm a strong correlation between the mass of ionized halo gas and the star formation rate per unit disk area .",
    "very little is known about the frequency and nature of star formation in elliptical galaxies , even though we have known for a long time that a large fraction contain cold gas ( van gorkom 1997 ; knapp 1999 ) .",
    "ferguson and collaborators ( 2001 ) have been making observations with ttf of a large sample of hi - selected ellipticals .",
    "essentially all of these systems ( see fig .  7 ) show evidence of star formation to date .    for her thesis work ,",
    "cianci ( 2003@xmath3 ) is undertaking a detailed comparison of 20 face - on spirals observed at  and , and uv ( 150 nm ) images from the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( see fig .",
    "her particular interest is to understand asymmetries in spiral galaxies , and the connection of the diffuse ionized gas with the hii regions and dust distribution ( cf .",
    "zurita 2001 ; zurita  2000 ) .    while spiral galaxies are commonly assumed to be axisymmetric , it is surprising how few galaxies approach this ideal .",
    "the origin of asymmetries may have profound implications for their properties .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the spiral galaxy disk ` sloshes around ' within the dark matter potential ( e.g. syer & tremaine 1996 ; schoenmakers , franx & de zeeuw 1997 ) or that the dark halo is lopsided ( jog 1999 ) .",
    "simulations show that the effects can survive for one or two rotation periods ( @xmath36 yr ) .    to date",
    ", studies of lopsidedness have concentrated on gas morphology and dynamics .",
    "but if the simulations are right , asymmetric variations should show up in the young stellar population of any lopsided spiral .",
    "cianci  ( 2003 ) may now have detected an @xmath37 asymmetry in the spiral arms of the interacting galaxies m83 and m51 .",
    "the uv continuum is enhanced relative to h@xmath10 along spurs that fall on the outside of the western arm .",

    "the lick spectral indices do not measure abundances per se , but can be transformed to quantities like [ fe / h ] via the method of spectral synthesis .",
    "the late - type spiral ngc 6221 shows a steep increase in both indices at the core , before dropping back to the nuclear values further out .",
    "this is in contrast to the early - type spiral ngc 7213 which has relatively constant indices in the core , followed by a smooth rise in the outer disk .",

    "jones  ( 2002@xmath4 ) discovered an extended  nebula associated with a pulsar moving rapidly through the interstellar medium .",
    "several of these sources are now known , but in the case of pulsar b0740 - 28 , the conic nebula is pinched perpendicular to the long axis .",
    "possible interpretations are variations in the pulsar wind or in the external ism .",
    "2.7 in      schuberth & burton ( 2000 ) used the ttf to observe arguably the most exotic line to date in the optical , the [ ci]872.7 nm line buried deep within the oh forest .",
    "this line is extremely important in photodissociation regions ( pdr ) .",
    "ngc 2023 is an hii region on the surface of a molecular cloud .",

    "[ ci ] is clearly a powerful tool for probing galactic star forming regions .",
    "there is presently a lot of interest in detecting variability from brown dwarfs .",
    "if the atmospheres and environs are cool enough , models suggest that there should be dust condensations which swirl around the brown dwarf producing variability in the light curve .",
    "this was detected for the first time by tinney & tolley ( 1999 ) in the m - type brown dwarf lp 944 - 20 .",
    "they used ttf in a novel set up which required the charge to step on the ccd in synchrony with the ttf being tuned between different bands .",
    "since then , variability has been found in another brown dwarf kelu-1 ( clarke 2002 ; clarke , tinney & covey 2002 ) .",
    "these sources do indeed appear to have complex weather patterns .",

    "the symbiotic - like optical spectrum of v2116 oph shows the presence of a red giant .",
    "the x - ray source is highly variable , so the [ oi ] line was studied in the hope of detecting variability .",
    "this was rejected to a high level of confidence .",
    "it is thought that the system is being seen at a special time , and is probably an x - ray pulsar undergoing rapid evolution .",
    "ryder ( 2001 ) was able to image mars in four narrow bands , a difficult experiment since the source is so bright . with four bands set at 390 , 500 , 668 and 707 nm , he produced high quality images of the ice caps , the maria and terae , and various cloud formations .",
    "jeremy bailey ( 2003 , private communication ) has recently emphasized the importance of tunable filters in monitoring weather patterns on mars and venus in narrow spectral bands .",
    "he compares the relative merits of a scanning slit , a tunable filter and an integral field spectrograph on an 8@xmath1510 m telescope .",
    "the demands on planetary science are ( i ) spatial stability , ( ii ) spatial integrity , ( iii ) spatial resolution of 25  mas or better , ( iv ) ability to switch rapidly between bands to maximize the time resolution , and to combat the planet s rotation . all of these requirements are met with a near - infrared tunable filter ( resolving power @xmath40 ) used in conjunction with adaptive optics on a large telescope .",
    "there are numerous ways in which tunable filters can find new and important uses in astronomical programs",
    ". one possible advance for tunable filters are devices which can operate at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "problems like piezo creep and slow gain at cryo temperatures can now be overcome .",
    "the largest tunable filter that queensgate can make ( 150 mm aperture ) is not well suited to 810 m telescopes .",
    "but there is no reason why a 300 mm aperture etalon , for example , can not be made .",
    "we have an initial design for such a system that uses an additional control stack at the centre of the plates , well matched to the central obstruction of most telescopes .",
    "this design requires a slightly reconfigured cs100 control system .",
    "it is commonly thought that tunable filters are restricted to switching between bands which fall within the restricted bandpass of the order sorting filter .",
    "in fact , a multiband order sorter ( offer & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) allows spectral bands at opposite ends of the optical spectrum to be observed in sequence ( cianci  2000 ) .",
    "there exists a wide class of sources which have never benefitted from detailed narrowband imaging largely because even through conventional narrow bands , the field stars saturate the detector .",
    "one of many examples was an attempt to measure gas metallicities in the vicinity of the trapezium .",
    "but rapid switching through differential ultranarrow bands makes this entirely feasible now .",
    "the straddle shuffle demonstration by maloney & bland - hawthorn ( 2001 ) has been used on galaxies with very bright disks and cores , leading to perfect cancellation of the continuum light and therefore revealing very weak levels of line emission .",
    "this same method should work well on young globular clusters in order to search for  emission , but this has not been attempted to date .",
    "tunable filters have major applications for adaptive optics imaging and for coronographic imaging .",
    "the use of differential narrowband imaging would greatly help to suppress any stray light around the central or nearby bright stars .",
    "b. woodgate has achieved some spectacular observations of emission line nebulae around symbiotic stars with the hubble space telescope , but the central stars are so bright that diffraction spikes are a major problem .",
    "there are numerous other applications , some of which require minor modifications to the existing hardware .",
    "these include new time series modes , nod & shuffle imaging , mask & shuffle imaging , broad - narrow switching , tunable polarimetric imaging ( all discussed in bland - hawthorn 2000 ) and tunable echelle imaging ( baldry & bland - hawthorn 2000 ) .",
