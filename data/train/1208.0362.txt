    "for nearly three decades now , starting with iras in the early 1980 s and continuing today with the _ spitzer _ and the akari space telescopes , the infrared properties of galaxies have been explored at ever increasing sensitivity , spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ; kennicutt et al .",
    "2003 ) represents the ` gold standard ' study of nearby galaxies , employing every infrared instrument of _ spitzer _ to study in detail the properties of 75 nearby ` representative ' galaxies . a larger _ spitzer _",
    "imaging sample is found in the sings follow - up project , local volume legacy ( lvl ) .",
    "expanding the sample to several thousand galaxies , the _",
    "survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( s4 g ; sheth et al .",
    "2010 ) continued the sings and lvl surveys through the two short ( near - infrared ) wavelength bands of irac ( 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m ) , focusing on the internal stellar structure of galaxies .",
    "following closely in succession to the akari all - sky survey ( murakami et al .",
    "2006 ) , the latest generation infrared space telescope , the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) , expands these powerful surveys through its all - sky coverage and mega - pixel cameras , capable of constructing large , diverse and complete statistical samples  for both the near - infrared and mid - infrared windows  sensitive to both stellar structure ( as with s4 g ) and interstellar processes ( as with sings ) .",
    "wise was specifically designed and optimized to detect and extract point source information .",
    "detection , for example , was carried out using co - addition of image frames that were constructed with a resampling method based on a matched filter derived from the wise point spread function ( psf ) . as a consequence , this interpolation method tends to smear the images , making them less optimal for detection and characterization of resolved sources .",
    "however , owing to the stable psf for all four wise bands , there is a way to apply deconvolution techniques to recover from the smearing and further improve the spatial resolution . in this first paper of a two part series ,",
    "we demonstrate how the angular resolution of wise may be enhanced to achieve information on physical scales comparable to those of _",
    "imaging , that enable detailed study of the internal anatomy of galaxies .",
    "we employ a resolution enhancement technique known as the maximum correlation method ( mcm ; masci & fowler 2009 ) to construct the wise high resolution galaxy atlas ( whrga ) , consisting of several thousand nearby galaxies .",
    "the whrga will comprise a complete mid - infrared source catalog and high - resolution image atlas of the largest angular - sized galaxies in the local universe . in this first paper",
    "we summarize the mcm algorithm and demonstrate its performance using wise , _ spitzer _ and galex imaging of nearby spiral galaxy ngc1566 . in the second paper ( jarrett et al . 2012b ; hereafter , referred to as paper ii ) , we demonstrate the early results of the whrga - project for a sample of 17 galaxies , all observed by _ spitzer _ and galex , chosen to be of large angular size , diverse morphology , and covering a range in color , stellar mass and star formation .",
    "in addition to basic photometry , source characterization and surface brightness decomposition , paper ii also derives star formation rates and stellar masses .",
    "this first paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 provides more technical information about the wise mission and data products .",
    "section 3 the ancillary data used to compare to wise , including _ spitzer _ and galex imaging .",
    "section 4 we outline the mcm image deconvolution- method and illustrate its performance using a set of simulated observations .",
    "section 5 we focus on a case study of ngc1566 to demonstrate the super - resolution performance using real wise imaging data .",
    "all reported magnitudes are in the vega system ( unless otherwise specified ) .",
    "the nasa - funded medium - class explorer mission , wise , consists of a 40-cm space infrared telescope , whose science instrumentation includes 1024x1024 pixel si : as and hgcdte arrays , cooled with a two - stage solid hydrogen cryostat .",
    "dichroic beamsplitters allow simultaneous images in four mid - infrared bands , each covering a @xmath1 field of view .",
    "the duty cycle was 11s , achieved using a scan mirror that stabilizes the line - of - sight while the spacecraft scans the sky , achieving an angular resolution of @xmath26@xmath3 in the short bandpasses and @xmath212@xmath3 in the longest bandpass .",
    "multiple , overlapping frames are combined to form deeper coadded images . launched in december of 2009 into a sun - synchronous polar orbit , over a time span of eight months wise completed its primary mission to survey the entire sky in the 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath0 m infrared bands with 5@xmath4 point - source sensitivities of at least 0.08 , 0.11 , 0.8 , and 4 mjy , respectively ( wright et al . 2010 ) and considerably deeper sensitivities at higher ecliptic latitudes ( jarrett et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "detailed in the wise explanatory supplement ( cutri et al . 2012 ) ,  atlas \" images .",
    "are created from single - exposure frames that touch a pre - defined 1.56@xmath51.56@xmath6 footprint on the sky . for each band ,",
    "a spatially registered image is produced by interpolating and coadding multiple 7.7/8.8s single - exposure images onto the image footprint . to suppress copious cosmic rays and other transient events that populate the single - exposure frames ,",
    "time - variant pixel outlier rejection is used during the co - addition process . the resulting sky intensity ",
    "atlas \" mosaics are 4095@xmath74095 pixels with 1.375@xmath3/pixel scale , providing a 1.56@xmath51.56@xmath6 wide - field .",
    "in addition to the sky intensity mosaics , 1@xmath4 uncertainty maps ( tracking the error in intensity values ) and depth - of - coverage maps are part of the standard products .",
    "the number of frames that are coadded depends on the field location relative to the ecliptic : those near the equator will have the lowest coverage ( typically 12 to 14 frames ) , while those near the poles have the highest coverage ( @xmath81000 frames ) .",
    "the wise all - sky public data release in march 2012 includes imaging and source catalogs , available through the infrared science archive ( irsa ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the wise source catalog is designed , optimized and calibrated for point sources .",
    "the complexity of detecting and measuring resolved sources was beyond the resources of the wise science data center ( wsdc ) processing .",
    "as a consequence , the wise archive and public release catalogs have either completely missed nearby galaxies or , even worse , their integrated fluxes are systematically underestimated ( because they are measured as point sources ) and often chopped into smaller pieces . however , the wise public - release imaging products do capture resolved and complex objects .",
    "one of the goals of this current study is to use new image products to characterize and assess the quality of source extraction for resolved galaxies observed by wise .",
    "we apply image resolution - enhancement techniques and compare the resulting measurements with those extracted using _",
    "imaging ( paper ii ) .",
    "in this first paper we focus on the spiral galaxy ngc1566 , which was part of the _ spitzer _ -sings survey of nearby galaxies .",
    "it is located at a distance of 9.5 mpc ( based on four separate tully - fisher measurements ; willick et al .",
    "1997 ; tully 1988 ) , has a morphological class type of sab(rs)bc and includes a seyfert-1 nucleus ( nasa extragalactic database ) .",
    "the sings team has provided enhanced - quality spectroscopy and imaging mosaics that is available to the publich through the _ spitzer _",
    "data archives . for this work ,",
    "we utilize _ spitzer _ -irac and _ spitzer _ -mips24 imaging , which are fully calibrated with astrometry and photometric solutions .",
    "additionally , the sings team have provided ancillary ground - based imaging , of which we use the optical b - band and h@xmath9 data products .",
    "galex fuv ( 0.1516 @xmath0 m ) and nuv ( 0.2267 @xmath0 m ) images of ngc1566 were obtained from the galex medium imaging survey ( mis ; martin et al .",
    "2005 ) , which were processed using the standard galex pipeline ( morrissey et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ) .",
    "the mis reaches a limiting nuv magnitude of 23 ( ab mag ) through multiple eclipse exposures that are typically 1 ks or greater in duration , while azimuthal averaging reaches surface brightness depths of @xmath230 to 31 magarcsec@xmath10 ( ab mag ) .",
    "the nominal spatial resolution of wise , @xmath26@xmath3 in the three short - wavelength bands and 12@xmath3 in the 22@xmath0 m band , is relatively poor compared to ground - based and space - based infrared observations ; e.g. , it is 3@xmath7 larger than that of _ spitzer _ irac imaging . for nearby galaxies ,",
    "the internal structures are smeared and strongly blended from the nucleus to the disk boundary ; consequently , it is a challenge to decompose the internal anatomy or make a detailed comparison with ground - based imaging ( e.g. , h@xmath9 line maps ) and s4 g irac imaging . except for the few largest galaxies , only the global properties",
    "are easily obtained from nominal wise imaging .",
    "we can , however , recover information that is lost within the wise primary beam using deconvolution methods .",
    "these take full advantage of the relatively stable and well - characterized point spread function ( psf ) of wise .",
    "the first method is the widely used variable - pixel linear reconstruction , or ",
    "drizzle \" technique of co - addition .",
    "the second is a true deconvolution technique detailed below .",
    "the wsdc has developed a generic co - addition and resolution enhancement ( hires ) tool specifically designed to operate on wise single - exposure image frames .",
    "this tool produces science - quality image products with statistically - validated uncertainty estimates on fluxes .",
    "the hires algorithm is based on the maximum correlation method ( mcm ) of masci & fowler ( 2009 ) and is an extension of the classic richardson - lucy deconvolution algorithm , originally implemented to boost the scientific return from iras approximately 20 years ago ( aumann et al .",
    "1990 ; fowler & aumann 1994 ; cao et al .",
    "1997 ) , and is still provided as an online service to users .    the scientific purpose of mcm - hires is to significantly enhance the spatial resolution of images while also conserving the integrated flux and maintaining photometric integrity with the extended , low surface brightness emission . fig .",
    "[ hires2 ] qualitatively demonstrates both requirements ; after resolution enhancement the wise imaging of the galaxy ngc1566 is greatly improved ( panel 1 vs. 2 ) and resembles the _ spitzer _ irac+mips-24 composite of the galaxy ( panel 3 ) .",
    "the spiral arms , filaments and lower surface brightness features in the wise hires image are also seen in the _ spitzer _ composite , there are no obvious artifacts or isolated features that are unique to the hires image relative to _",
    "spitzer_. the images are shown with four colors , where each color is assigned to a wise band : blue @xmath11 w1 ( 3.4 @xmath0 m ) , cyan @xmath11 w2 ( 4.6 @xmath0 m ) , orange @xmath11 w3 ( 12 @xmath0 m ) and red @xmath11 w4 ( 22 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "stellar light from the old , evolved population will appear blue / green and tends to concentrate in the nucleus and bulge regions .",
    "the ism , warmed and excited by star formation , will appear yellow / orange , delineating hii  and photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) as well as warm dust emission ( red ) from the disk .",
    "later ( section xx ) we conduct a quantitative comparison between wise , _ spitzer _ and galex .",
    "the overall goal of mcm is to yield a  model \" of the sky that is consistent with the observations to within measurement error ; see fig [ mcm ] .",
    "the baseline algorithm assumes no prior information or regularizing constraints like in previous approaches , although use of prior ( e.g. , cross - wavelength ) information is optional .",
    "mcm allows for non - isoplanatic ( spatially - varying ) point spread functions , noise - variance weighting , _ a - posteriori _ uncertainty estimation , ringing - suppression , statistically motivated convergence criteria and metrics to assess the quality of hires solutions , and use of redundant overlapping exposures to optimize the signal - to - noise .",
    "the tool also includes preparatory steps such as background - level and photometric - throughput matching , and outlier / bad - pixel detection and masking . to follow",
    ", we validate its performance with simulations and then with real imaging from wise that is compared with _ spitzer _ , galex and ground - based imaging .",
    "we have explored the impact of the mcm process on photometric flux and noise measurements extracted from resolution - enhanced images using simulations .",
    "a simulation here is useful for two reasons : first , it enables us to validate the accuracy of outputs given knowledge of the truth , and second , it provides us with a method for unambiguously computing the output noise ( in response to the input ) by simulating repeated noise realizations sampled from a known input noise - distribution model .",
    "the simulation uses a single input image with input / output pixel sizes similar to that used in processing of the wise images in this work and paper ii .",
    "we assumed a spatially flat background of 30 dn and added a point - source of total flux 3000 dn at the center of the image , convolved with the w1 native psf .",
    "we could have used another wise band , but any one band suffices to illustrate the hires performance in general .",
    "we then added poisson noise to this image with variance @xmath12 , where we assumed an electronic gain factor of @xmath13 for simplicity .",
    "different input noise models and/or distributions do nt change our general conclusions . 500 independent noise realizations ( or trials ) were simulated for the input image , and each trial was processed through the mcm - hires algorithm to seven different iterations : 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 , and 32 .",
    "output hires images at these iterations for a _ single _ simulation - trial are shown in figure [ sim1 ] . at the top - left of this figure",
    "is the input raw simulated image for this trial .",
    "we used the same mcm processing parameters as used for the wise image reconstructions in this work and paper ii .",
    "one can see in figure [ sim1 ] that at low iterations , the noise becomes spatially correlated , then with increasing iteration , the positive noise spikes and the point - source at the center gradually `` decorrelate '' and sharpen . here",
    "the point - source fwhm went from @xmath14 ( raw input simulated image ) to @xmath15 ( iteration 32 ) , equivalent to an increase of 11@xmath7 in the flux per solid angle at the point source position .",
    "figure [ sim2]-left shows the dependence of the measured point - source flux ( using standard aperture photometry ) on the number of mcm iterations from the single simulation - trial images and the average over all 500 independent trials at each iteration number .",
    "this shows that the measured fluxes are consistent with the true flux ( within measurement error ) or what one would measure in an `` observed '' noisy image .",
    "this is an important requirement for any deconvolution process .",
    "figure [ sim2]-right shows the behavior of the photometric signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio and 1-@xmath4 uncertainty in the integrated point - source flux ( i.e. , the single simulation - trial error bars in figure [ sim2]-left ) as estimated from the standard - deviation of measurements over 500 independent trials . in general , the s / n is expected to smoothly decrease monotonically with iteration number .",
    "the hump in s / n at iterations 16 and 24 is due to noise in the single - trial flux measurements at these iterations .",
    "the decrease in the integrated s / n is a consequence of noise amplification in general with increasing iteration number ( red dashed curve in figure [ sim2]-right ) .",
    "noise amplification is most prevalent when the `` ringing suppression '' option is used in mcm ( adopted throughout this work ) .",
    "it leads to an asymmetric noise distribution with positive noise tail that grows progressively with increasing iteration ( for details , see masci & fowler 2009 ) .",
    "however , the observed drop in integrated s / n is relatively small , and is @xmath16% over 20 mcm iterations  the maximum number of iterations used in this work .    similarly ,",
    "figure [ sim3 ] illustrates the evolution of the peak pixel - flux of our simulated point - source , including its 1-@xmath4 uncertainty and signal - to - noise ratio as a function of mcm iteration number .",
    "all measurements pertain to single simulation trials .",
    "it shows the effective rate at which the flux of a point - source is forced into its peak with increasing iteration ( assuming the wise pixel sampling ) . the increase in peak pixel - flux is a factor of @xmath17 from iteration 1 to 32 .",
    "compared to the uncertainties in integrated flux measurements ( figure [ sim2 ] ) , the relative increase in the peak - flux uncertainty with iteration number ( figure [ sim3 ] ) is appreciably greater .",
    "this implies local ( pixel - scale ) noise - fluctuations are more prone to amplification by the mcm process especially when the ringing suppression option is utilized ( see above ) .",
    "furthermore , we find the amount of amplification depends on the input noise level .",
    "for example , figure [ sim3 ] also shows the evolution of the background pixel spatial - rms ( dotted curve , @xmath710 for clarity ) .",
    "the input background ( poisson ) noise simulated here is a factor of 8@xmath7 ( in @xmath4 ) below that at the point - source peak position , and the background rms varies by only a factor of @xmath18 from iteration 1 to 32 .",
    "meanwhile , the peak pixel 1-@xmath4 flux uncertainty varies by a factor of @xmath19 over the same iteration interval .",
    "this shows that mcm is inherently a non - linear process in the reconstruction of signals in the presence of noise .",
    "to summarize , mcm - hires is is capable of generating science quality image products with uncertainty estimates on fluxes .",
    "testing on _ spitzer _ and wise imaging has shown that it can achieve a factor of @xmath23 to 4 increase in resolution per axis ( using 10 to 20 iterations ) , corresponding to at least an order magnitude increase in flux per unit solid angle ( fig 1 . ;",
    "see also paper ii ) .",
    "the gain in resolution improves with increasing survey depth - of - coverage since multiple frame overlaps will provide better sampling of the psf .",
    "nonetheless , the psf at all wise bands is sampled at slightly better than the nyquist rate so that optimal enhancement will be possible at even the lowest depths - of - coverage .",
    "next , we look in more detail at the hires performance for ngc1566 .",
    "the nearby spiral galaxy ngc1566 ( d = 9.5 mpc ) is used to demonstrate the resolution gain using the mcm - hires deconvolution technique ( section 3.3 ) . in comparison to _ spitzer _",
    "imaging , the wise hires reconstructed images are , in a qualitative sense , remarkably similar , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hires2 ] .",
    "note that ngc1566 was well covered by wise , due to its location at high ecliptic latitude , and thus we expect even better performance with this galaxy ; the performance gain from a more diverse set of galaxies is presented in paper ii . here",
    "we consider narrower point source profiles in the field of the ngc1566 galaxy , the improved spatial resolution of the galaxy in comparison to atlas and ` drizzle ' co - addition images of wise , and the performance with extended emission and lower surface brightness features .",
    "the improvement in the spatial resolution , as traced by foreground stars located near ngc1566 , is shown in fig .",
    "the wise ` drizzled ' image results are shown with the black solid line , and the dashed black line the mcm - hires results for a point source .",
    "the fwhm for the ` drizzle ' images is 5.9 , 6.5 , 7.0 and 12.4 arcsec , for w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 respectively , compared to 2.6 , 3.0 , 3.5 and 5.5 arcsec , for w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 respectively for hires .",
    "the point source fwhm results are summarized in table 1 . at the distance of 9.5 mpc ,",
    "the hires is sampling physical scales down to 120 pc .",
    "the figure also shows the psf beams for drizzled _ spitzer _ irac and mips-24 imaging , and the galex nuv and b - band imaging . in the case of irac ,",
    "the fwhm is 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 arsec for irac-1 , irac-2 and irac4 , respectively .",
    "the mips-24 beam fwhm is 5.2 arcsec .",
    "the galex nuv has an effective beam fwhm of 4.8 arcsec , while the optical b - band image has relatively good seeing , fwhm = 1.3 arcsec .",
    "it is clear that improvement in spatial resolution is significant for the wise imaging , achieving scales that are similar to those of _",
    "spitzer _ imaging , and at the shorter wavelengths better than those of galex .",
    "next we inspect the performance on the galaxy itself .",
    "fig 1 . shows a color composite of all wise bands simultaneously , comparing the nominal atlas to hires performance .",
    "decomposing into the individual components , fig .",
    "[ hiresbw ] , the hires improvement ( lower panels ) is clearly evident across all bands : the spiral arms , disk star - formation aggregates and circumnuclear regions are revealed .",
    "the improvement in angular resolution is approximately a factor of 3 to 4 , with the resulting fwhm @xmath23@xmath3 for w1 , w2 and w3 , and @xmath26@xmath3 for w4 .",
    "another way to view the relative improvement in performance at large scales is through 1-d slices , cutting across the nucleus and spiral arms north and south of the center ( see fig .",
    "[ line cuts ] ) . to gauge the resolution fidelity of the wise hires ,",
    "also shown are the corresponding slices through irac and mips-24 .",
    "roughly five different spiral arms are crossed by the horizontal cuts .",
    "discrete structures are more sharply delineated with hires and irac , while the overall , mean surface brightness is conserved ( see also fig .",
    "[ hires3 ] below , showing the radial , azimuthal average ) .        in particular ,",
    "w3 is notably improved , the strong neutral - pah emission arising within the spiral arms and tracing star formation regions create the sawtooth pattern in the slices and nucleus , inter - arm and spiral - arm features in the azimuthal average .",
    "all of these features are seen in the irac profiles , validating the reconstruction .",
    "w4 shows an unavoidable consequence of the mcm - hires method : the formation of dark ( lower intensity ) troughs around regions with bright , rapidly - varying emission on compact spatial scales .",
    "much lower amplitude troughs appear in the mip-24 image , verifying that the w4 hires does have this artifact feature .",
    "for example , note the cut through the bright nucleus ( w4 panel of fig .",
    "[ line cuts ] ) , likewise seen in the azimuthal average of the radial surface brightness , where the w4 panel of fig .",
    "[ hires3 ] shows the circular  ring \" trough at a radius @xmath215@xmath3 . at small scales ,",
    "the flux is conserved within a circular area that encompasses the source and ` ring ' .",
    "although this  ringing \" phenomenon is minimized in the current hires method , it is strongest in the w4 reconstructions due to the relatively earlier onset of saturation that can modify source profiles compared to the native psf .",
    "the higher background in general also has an impact on the ringing that is introduced into the reconstruction .",
    "caution is required when interpreting the w4 light distribution in proximity to bright sources ( stars , nuclei , etc ) ; nevertheless , as we show in section 4.3 , the overall w4 integrated flux is conserved and the reconstructions maintain science - level quality .",
    "at yet larger scales , we investigate the relative performance by azimuthally averaging the surface brightness , comparing the resultant radial profiles .",
    "the local background was derived using an annulus with an inner radius of 6.7 arcmin and a width of 0.3 arcmin ( data reduction is discussed in detail in paper ii ) .",
    "[ hires3 ] shows the radial profiles extending down to the local background level , roughly 24.9 , 24.5 , 22.1 and 18.3 mag arcsec@xmath10 for w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 respectively .",
    "the only significant difference between the atlas and hires radial profiles are the better resolved spiral arms and nuclear regions , notably for the star formation sensitive w3 and w4 bands . at low surface brightnesses",
    ", the hires is clearly conserving flux relative to the atlas images .",
    "we now compare the wise hires radial surface brightness profiles to those measured using _",
    "spitzer _ and galex imaging .",
    "[ n1566radial ] presents the surface brightness for wise ( w1 and w2 ) and _ spitzer _ ( irac-1 and irac-2 ) , and the addition of galex ( nuv ) to the w3+irac-4 profiles and galex ( fuv ) to the w4+mips-24 profiles .",
    "the wise and _ spitzer _ magnitudes are in standard vega units , and the galex magnitudes are in ab units plus an offset of @xmath207 magnitudes to fit within the plot limits .",
    "the first panel shows that w1 3.4 @xmath0 m and irac-1 3.6@xmath0 m have very similar profiles , both easily reaching depths of @xmath224 mag arcsec@xmath10 ( corresponding to 26.7 mag arcsec@xmath10 in ab ) .",

    "the w2 and irac-2 depth reaches a similar limit of @xmath224 mag arcsec@xmath10 ( corresponding to 27.3 mag arcsec@xmath10 in ab ) .",
    "both of these short - wavelength sets , w1/irac-1 and w2/irac-2 , have bandpasses that are similar enough that less than 5 to 10% deviations are expected due to spectral differences ( detailed band - to - band analysis is presented in paper ii ) .",
    "the third panel shows the w3 12 @xmath0 m , irac-4 8 @xmath0 m , and galex nuv + fuv .",
    "both w3 and irac-4 have the same shape ( radius @xmath21 150 arcsec ) , but are offset slightly due to band - to - band differences between wise and _ spitzer _ : we would expect a flux ratio of 1.1 for late - type galaxies ( see paper ii ) . also the irac-4 8 @xmath0 m surface brightness is falling rapidly beyond a radius of 200 arcsec , likely due increased noise and an asymmetric background gradient that is created by scattered light and detector muxbleed from a nearby bright star ( see fig . 1 ,",
    "also see fig .",

    "the uv light then falls off steeper than the infrared light between 300 and 400@xmath22 , but then dramatically extends well beyond ( @xmath23 500@xmath22 ) the infrared signal , forming an additional set of arms that are invisible to wise and barely seen in irac-4 ( see below , fig [ 3im ] ) .",

    ", the w4 band appears shifted relative to the galex bands , although it is not as distinct as 12 @xmath0 m comparison .",
    "the final set of comparisons to be made in this ngc1566 analysis is concerned with the smallest scales . to demonstrate the power of hires and its ability to tease out structure at small scales , we zoom into the southeastern , inner spiral arm .",

    "the overall and detailed morphology that the wise hires image is revealing is validated and confirmed with the _ spitzer _ -irac 8 @xmath0 m image .",
    "the knots , gradients and shape of the region are reveal in wise are easily seen in _",
    "spitzer _ :",
    "this confirms that the mcm process is stable and reliable , recovering spatial information that is astrophysical and real . comparing to the unobscured , massive star formation tracers ( lower panels ) , the primary site of star formation ( high surface brightness features ) are co - spatial .",
    "the h@xmath9 image , with its superior angular resolution , resolves many of these bright knots into smaller components ( on physical scales the size of giant molecular clouds ) , but is only sensitive to the high surface brightness population ( hii regions ) .",
    "both the infrared and nuv trace more diffuse emission that is associated with star formation from less massive ( yet far more numerous ) stars .",
    "the nominal wise atlas images are fully adequate to study the global characteristics of galaxies , but as fig [ 6grid ] clearly demonstrates , the hires technique is crucial if wise is to be used to study the detailed anatomy of galaxies . as a final demonstration , we now combine the power of the wise bands to understand galaxy evolution . the w1 ( and w2 ) band is sensitive to the dominate mass component of ( most ) galaxies , namely the evolved stellar population .",
    "in contrast , the w3 ( and w4 ) is sensitive to the present - day star formation activity . combining the two creates a metric that is used to assess the present to past star formation history .",
    "this metric is also known as the specific star formation rate , generally stated as the ratio of the star formation rate ( sfr ) to the stellar mass ( m@xmath24 ) . for this demonstration",
    ", we simply ratio the w3 image ( which is proportional to the sfr , as detailed in paper ii ) , to the w1 image ( which is proportional to m@xmath24 plus a color term , detailed in paper ii ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ ssfr ] , where we are comparing the wise ssfr with the equivalent _ spitzer _ ssfr ( irac 8 to 3.6 @xmath0 m ratio ) .",
    "it is no surprise that the wise atlas result is mostly washed out , only painting a gentle gradient across the field ( i.e. , the spiral arm itself ) .",
    "the hires result , however , reveals several concentrations of high ssfr ( as confirmed by the _",
    "these regions of enhanced ssfr are precisely where the galaxy is creating new building blocks , where it is actively building its disk .",
    "in contrast , the low ssfr regions , dominated by the inner - arm regions , are currently quiescent and filled with older , evolved stars .",
    "a metric such as the ssfr demands the highest resolution possible since it is a ratio of two separate images , and only wise hires provides enough information to study the details star formation evolution in galaxies .        as a final note to the analysis presented in this work ,",
    "ngc1566 is not an exception , the spatial resolution improvement from mcm - hires is realized for all of the galaxies in the sample presented in paper ii , which assesses the photometric performance of the reconstructed images in comparison to _ spitzer _ photometry .",
    "in this paper we have presented a method by which to recover spatial information and significantly improve the angular resolution of wise mid - infrared imaging , enabling detailed study of the internal anatomy of galaxies .",
    "developed by the wise science data center , the maximum correlation method ( mcm ) yields improvements that are 3 to 4 times better than the nominal wise atlas imaging resolution , and factors of 2 to 3 times improvement from standard ` drizzle ' co - addition . using the nearby galaxy ngc1566 as a case study",
    ", we demonstrate how the angular resolution of wise may be accurately enhanced to achieve information on physical scales comparable to those of _ spitzer _ imaging .",
    "this method will be used to construct the wise high resolution galaxy atlas ( whrga ) , consisting of several thousand nearby galaxies .",
    "a pilot study is now underway , the initial results derived from a sample of 17 large , nearby galaxies is presented in a companion paper .",
