    "the confirmation of neutrino oscillation phenomena , by atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments@xcite , have deepen our knowledge about the neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing .",
    "huge progress have been made in extracting the information of neutrino mixing parameters from the lepton mixing matrix . in three flavor neutrino mixing paradigm , generally , the determination of neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences , are based on the assumption that the lepton mixing matrix is unitary in order to conserve probability .",
    "however , in case of generic models including extra gauge fermionic singlet namely sterile neutrinos or right handed neutrinos , the unitarity of lepton mixing matrix gets violated and have initiated plethora of research on new physics(np ) beyond standard model(sm ) .",
    "although the total lagrangian containing np remain unitary and probability is conserved , but a submatrix of the total mixing matrix may be non - unitary . moreover , if in any theory the @xmath12 pontecorvo - maki - nakagava - sakata(pmns ) mixing matrix considered to be a part of larger matrix , which comprise of heavy fields(heavier than electroweak scale ) , may result in an effective @xmath12 non - unitary mixing matrix for three light leptonic fields@xcite .",
    "one example , where non - unitarity can be achieved , is the generic type - i seesaw mechanism@xcite .",
    "the non - unitarity effects observed at higher energies(comparable to grand unification scale ) with type - i seesaw mechanism , the non - unitary effects are small .",
    "however , in case of non - minimal seesaw models where heavy scale is of the order of tev , the non - unitarity effects can be appreciable@xcite . in type - i seesaw mechanism ,",
    "the neutrino masses are effectively described by unique lepton number violating dimension five weinberg operator , though the origin of non - unitarity in leptonic mixing matrix is due to the lepton number conserving dimension six operator contributing to the kinetic terms of the neutrinos@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the significant amount of non - unitarity can be established with the dimension d = 6 operator , in seesaw mechanism at lower energies . beyond sm ,",
    "np effects are well addressed by an effective field theory extension named minimal unitarity violation scheme@xcite .",
    "previously , under muv scheme , the non - unitary parameters have been constrained and connection between muv and nonstandard interactions have been studied in@xcite . moreover",
    ", the muv extensions of sm with significant non - unitarity , can render leptogenesis mechanism , for generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe , more efficient@xcite .",
    "recently , constraints on non - unitary parameters have been updated by electroweak precision observable@xcite , which also points towards the non - zero non - unitary parameters .",
    "the oscillation channel @xmath0 , has been found to have the best sensitivities for observing the non - unitarity , as discussed in@xcite .",
    "moreover , the short baseline experiments are excellent probe to search for np with non - unitary parameter @xmath1@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we focussed on @xmath13 channel to study the non - unitary neutrino mixing . in section 2 , we have discussed the formalism of muv scheme for parameterising the non - unitary neutrino mixing matrix and to obtain the general expression for oscillation probability for @xmath0 channel , in vacuum .",
    "we have investigated the sensitivities of @xmath0 oscillation to non - unitary parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 with normal and inverted hierarchical neutrino masses . also , the effect of @xmath3 , being above or below maximality , on the sensitivities of non - unitary parameters will be discussed . in section 3",
    ", we explore a very wide range of @xmath10 ratio to forecast in principle , the possibilities to measure the @xmath7-violation(@xmath14 ) due to unitary(@xmath11 ) and non - unitary(@xmath2 ) phases . in section 4 ,",
    "we conclude our results .",
    "under muv extension of standard model , the dimension five operator breaks the electroweak symmetry by providing masses to the neutrinos .",
    "the dimension six operator leads to the origin of non - unitary mixing matrix by canonical normalization of kinetic terms of neutrinos .",
