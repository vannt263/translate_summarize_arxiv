    "<S> recently , bercovici has introduced multiplicative convolutions based on muraki s monotone independence and shown that these convolution of probability measures correspond to the composition of some function of their cauchy transforms . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a new proof of this fact based on the combinatorics of moments . </S>",
    "<S> we also give a new characterisation of the probability measures that can be embedded into continuous monotone convolution semigroups of probability measures on the unit circle and briefly discuss a relation to galton - watson processes . </S>"
