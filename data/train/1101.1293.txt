    "<S> the luneburg lens is an aberration - free lens that focuses light from all directions equally well . </S>",
    "<S> we fabricated and tested a luneburg lens in silicon photonics . </S>",
    "<S> our technique is sufficiently versatile for making perfect imaging devices on silicon platforms .    </S>",
    "<S> lenses are indispensible optical instruments , but most conventional lenses suffer from aberrations @xcite  the focus depends on the direction of incidence and deteriorates off axis . </S>",
    "<S> the luneburg lens @xcite can focus light from all directions equally well . </S>",
    "<S> this lens establishes a classic example of non - euclidean transformation optics @xcite where light in a medium is experiencing a curved spatial geometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> luneburg lenses are applied in microwave technology @xcite but have remained impossible to implement in optics . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate an integrated luneburg lens on a silicon chip that works for near - infrared light . </S>",
    "<S> such lenses may become the building blocks of compact fourier optics in silicon photonics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of the luneburg lens is limited by the wavelength of light , but our manufacturing method is also sufficiently versatile for making future perfect imaging devices @xcite on silicon platforms .    the luneburg lens @xcite is a rotationally symmetric thick lens with a spatially varying refractive - index profile that focuses light on the rim of the lens ( fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the focal point lies in the direction of the incident light ; the lens thus turns the direction of a light ray into the position of the focus . in terms of light waves </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it performs a fourier transformation . </S>",
    "<S> because of its rotational symmetry , the luneburg lens is an ideal lens free from optical aberrations @xcite , but it is not a perfect lens @xcite : its focus size is limited by the wavelength of light @xcite ( fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it could become an important optical instrument , in particular in integrated photonics , if it were possible to make luneburg lenses . </S>",
    "<S> the required index profile @xmath0 of the lens is currently impossible to create by doping optical materials , as the profile is given by the formula @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the distance from the centre of the lens and @xmath3 its outer radius . </S>",
    "<S> luneburg s formula ( [ lune ] ) shows that one needs to create an index profile with a contrast of @xmath4 , which is far from the reach of current doping techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> we have made a luneburg lens in silicon photonics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there light is typically confined in waveguiding structures on planar silicon chips . instead of doping </S>",
    "<S> , one can exploit the three - dimensional nature of the waveguide to create an effective index profile for two - dimensional wave propagation on the chip . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the luneburg lens is a thin graded silicon disk ( less than @xmath5 thick ) of @xmath6 radius put between a @xmath7 silica layer on a silicon substrate and an su8 polymer layer on top ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total thickness of the silicon disk and the polymer is fixed to be @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the fact that the effective refractive index in a waveguide depends on its geometric dimensions . as the thickness of the silicon disk </S>",
    "<S> is only gradually changing compared with the wavelength , we can find the local refractive index @xmath0 assuming a simple model : a planar sandwich of silicon substrate , silica , silicon layer , polymer and air , with each layer in the model having the local thickness of the layer in the actual device . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2b shows the effective index @xmath0 depending on the silicon thickness for light of @xmath9 wavelength and polarized such that the magnetic field points orthogonal to the layer structure ( while the electric field is parallel to the structure ) . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that the index range is sufficient to implement the luneburg lens and other , perfectly imaging lenses such as maxwell s fish eye @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2c shows the silicon profile of our luneburg lens ( measured with a bruker dektak 150 stylus profiler ) against the corresponding theoretical curve of formula ( [ lune ] ) translated to a thickness profile by the relationship illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b .    </S>",
    "<S> tapered waveguides like ours have been applied before for creating effective index profiles . </S>",
    "<S> early luneburg - type lenses @xcite were fabricated by sputtering @xcite but there the index contrast was insufficient for creating the proper luneburg lens with profile ( [ lune ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a crude luneburg lens was made with a macroscopic , multimode waveguide @xcite , but such a device is far too large to be integrated . </S>",
    "<S> recently , approximate eaton / minano @xcite and maxwell fish eye @xcite lenses were created by putting liquid droplets on a substrate @xcite , but they can not be integrated in a solid - state device and are not fully controllable . </S>",
    "<S> luneburg lenses for surface plasmons @xcite were proposed and numerically studied @xcite but not made in practice . in our case , we use dielectrics that are significantly less absorptive than the metals needed for plasmons . </S>",
    "<S> one could make similar index profiles with silicon metamaterials @xcite , but here scattering losses at the structures of metamaterials become a critical limitation @xcite , whereas the index profiles made by our method are continuos and sufficiently smooth . with our technique </S>",
    "<S> one can controllably fabricate nearly arbitrary index profiles within the range specified in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b on silicon photonics platforms that can combine electronics with photonics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such devices will work for infrared light light in the telecom band and can form the building blocks of on - chip fourier optics .    for fabricating our luneburg lens we used grey - scale electron - beam lithography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , the prefabricated silicon on insulator chip ( @xmath7 silica , @xmath10 silicon capping layer ) was cleaned in acetone and ipa in an ultrasonic bath and ashed with oxygen plasma . su8 </S>",
    "<S> resist of @xmath11 thickness was then spun and soft - baked for @xmath12 at @xmath13 followed by @xmath14 at @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> for the grey - scale lithography we used a leo - raith modified electron beam with a positional accuracy of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the resist was exposed at @xmath17 with a dose ranging from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> particular care had to be exercised in choosing the dose profile that produces the required silicon profile . </S>",
    "<S> we found empirically that a dose @xmath20 with profile @xmath21 results in the luneburg profile shown in fig .  2c . </S>",
    "<S> after exposure the sample was developed with ec for @xmath22 and hard - baked for @xmath23 at @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we transferred the gray - scale profile to the silicon via reactive ion etching , using a blend of o2:sf6:chf3=75:100:100 at @xmath25 for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> finally the chip was spin coated with a layer of su8 polymer with a maximum thickness of @xmath8 , soft - baked , exposed for @xmath12 to uv light and hard - baked to cross - link and stabilize the polymer . the sample was then cleaved for end - fire coupling ( where we couple light in from the side ) .    after fabrication </S>",
    "<S> , we tested the optical performance of our luneburg lens . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental measurements were performed via end - fire coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the beam from a c+l band amplified spontaneous emission source ( centre wavelength @xmath27 , bandwidth @xmath28 ) was polarized ( with the electric field parallel to the top surface of the device ) and focused with a 10x objective on the facet of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the beam was free to diffract in the planar waveguide until it enters the luneburg lens . </S>",
    "<S> we observed the luneburg lens from the top with a 50x mitutoyo objective lens , with a numerical aperture of 0.55 , and the image was taken by a vidicon electrophysics micronviewer camera ( spectral response : @xmath29 to @xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we saw a strong intensity peak at the focal spot ( that originates from the focused infrared light scattered at small imperfections ) . to make the lens visible in our image we illuminated the device with an independent white led . </S>",
    "<S> all the measurements taken with the camera were calibrated using the known radius @xmath3 of the lens , as measured independently with the profiler ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3a shows the image acquired with the camera in false color . </S>",
    "<S> the light comes from the right hand side . </S>",
    "<S> the red spot is the focused infrared light , while the outline of the lens appears solely due the independent white led illumination . from this figure , it is possible to measure the spot size in the two marked directions ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the measured minimum spot size is @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> we expect from theory ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) that the focal spot is about half a wavelength in size , but in our experiment it was wider . several factors could contribute to the spot size  the optical resolution of the microscope used in combination with the propagation in the polymer layer , the geometrical dispersion of the lens ( as we used a broad band of wavelengths ) , scattering due to roughness and the finite width of the incident beam . </S>",
    "<S> the latter aspect turns out to account for the observed broadening . </S>",
    "<S> the input beam was not a plane wave but a gaussian beam . </S>",
    "<S> the input waist was measured to be approximately @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the luneburg lens was a distance of @xmath33 away from the chip facet , which means that ( assuming a gaussian beam profile ) the beam reached the lens with angles between -1.1 and + 1.1 degrees , with a resulting arclenght of @xmath34 , which agrees with the measured focus size in our luneburg lens .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed further experiments to characterize the behavior of our luneburg lens . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we launched light on the lens at different angles , to show that the lens effectively implements a spatial fourier transform . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows three cases with tilting angle + 4 , 0 and -4 degrees in panel a ) , b ) and c ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the lens focuses equally well from all directions . </S>",
    "<S> we also displaced the input beam with respect to the central axis of the lens , see panels d ) and e ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . recall that the beam size was smaller than the lens itself . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the focused spot still appeared in the middle of the lens , confirming that the lens implements a fourier transform , as it is mostly sensitive to the direction of propagation rather than to the spatial distribution of the beam itself . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus demonstrated a fully functional luneburg lens in silicon photonics that can be used in integrated imaging devices . </S>",
    "<S> for this we exploited the three - dimensional geometric aspects of waveguides to implement refractive - index profiles for two - dimensional wave propagation that are normally impossible to make in optical materials . </S>"
