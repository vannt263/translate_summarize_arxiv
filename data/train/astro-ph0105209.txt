    "an important characteristic of the sun and solar - type stars is their variability over a very large range of time ( and space ) scales , including the intermediate time scales of @xmath0 years ( weiss 1990 ) .",
    "though ultimately spatiotemporal in character , these variabilities fall into two categories : ( i ) those whose main features can be explained in terms of temporal models and ( ii ) those which require a spatiotemporal approach for their explanations .",
    "here we shall be focusing on two such forms of variability , namely the grand minima type episodes seen in in sunspot activity and the recently observed dynamical variations of the differential rotation in the solar convection zone .",
    "evidence for the presence of the grand  minima type behaviour comes from a variety of sources , including the studies of the historical records of the annual mean sunspot data since 1607 ad which show the occurrence of epochs of suppressed sunspot activity , such as the _ maunder minimum _ ( eddy 1976 , foukal 1990 , wilson 1994 , ribes & nesme - ribes 1993 , hoyt & schatten 1996 ) .",
    "further research , employing @xmath1 ( stuiver & quey 1980 ; stuiver & braziunas 1988 , 1989 ) and @xmath2 ( beer _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 , 1994a , b , weiss & tobias 1997 ) as proxy indicators , has provided additional strong evidence that the occurrence of such epochs of reduced activity ( referred to as _ grand minima _ ) has persisted with irregular time intervals in the past .",
    "further , they appear to be typical of solar - type stars ( baliunas _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) .",
    "evidence for the variations in the dynamical behaviour of the differential rotation comes from recent analyses of the inversions of the helioseismic data from both the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) instrument on board the soho spacecraft and the global oscillation network group ( gong ) project which provide evidence to show ( i ) that the previously observed surface torsional oscillations with periods of about 11 years ( e.g.  howard & labonte 1980 ; snodgrass , howard & webster 1985 ; kosovichev & schou 1997 ; schou _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) extend significantly downwards into the solar convective zone to depths of about 10 percent in radius ( howe _ et al .",
    "_ 2000a and antia & basu 2000 ; see covas _",
    "2000a for a recent study ) , and ( ii ) that the dynamical regimes at the base of the convection zone may be different from those observed at the top , having either significantly shorter periods ( howe _ et al . _",
    "2000b ) or non  periodic behaviour ( antia & basu 2000 ) .",
    "our aim here is to briefly describe some recent attempts at understanding these phenomena within a nonlinear theoretical framework .",
    "the seemingly irregular variations of the grand minima type in the sunspot activity are of interest for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly , they are theoretically challenging , especially in view of the absence of any naturally occurring mechanisms in the sun and solar - type stars with appropriate time scales ( gough 1990 ) . secondly , given their time scales ,",
    "such variations can be of potential consequence for the occurrence of climatic variability on similar time scales ( e.g.  friis - christensen & lassen 1991 , beer _ at al .",
    "_ 1994b , lean 1994 , stuiver , grootes & braziunas 1995 , baliunas & soon 1995 , butler & johnston 1996 , white _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .",
    "these considerations have motivated considerable effort into trying to understand the mechanism(s ) underlying such variations , employing a variety of approaches ( e.g.  weiss _ et al . _ 1984 ; sokoloff and nesme  ribes 1994 ; tobias _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; knobloch and landsberg 1996 ; schmitt _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , knobloch _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; tobias 1998a , b ; tobias _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .    in principle , there are essentially two frameworks within which such variabilities could be studied : stochastic and deterministic . in practice , however , it is difficult to distinguish between these two frameworks ( weiss 1990 ) .",
    "here we shall concentrate on the deterministic approach and recall that whatever the relevant framework may turn out to be , the deterministic components will still be present and are likely to play an important role .    within this framework , a number of approaches have been adopted . among these",
    "is the employment of low dimensional ode models that are obtained using the normal form approach ( spiegel 1994 , tobias _",
    "_ 1995 , knobloch _ et al .",
    "these have led to robust modes of behaviour which are of potential importance in accounting for certain aspects of solar variability of the grand minima type , such as various forms of amplitude modulation of the magnetic field energy .    an alternative way to understand",
    "this type of variability in the sunspot record is to postulate that this type of behaviour is caused by some form of dynamical intermittency , an idea that in various forms goes back at least to the late 1970s ( e.g. tavakol 1978 , ruzmaikin 1981 , zeldovich _ et al .",
    "_ 1983 , weiss _",
    "_ 1984 , spiegel 1985 , feudel _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 , schmitt _",
    "_ 1996 , brooke 1997 , tworkowski _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "much effort has gone into producing evidence for the occurrence of various forms of dynamical intermittency in both truncated and pde mean - field dynamo models . given the large number of intermittency types that dynamical systems theory has produced and bearing in mind the complexity of the full dynamo equations",
    ", a natural approach would be to single out the main generic ingredients of stellar dynamos and to study their dynamical consequences .",
    "for axisymmetric dynamo models , these ingredients consist of the presence of invariant subspaces , non - normal parameters and the non - skew property ( see e.g. ashwin _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 for definitions ) .",
    "the dynamics underlying such systems has recently been studied ( covas _ et al .",
    "_ 1997c , 1999b ; ashwin _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , leading to a number of novel phenomena , including a new type of intermittency , referred to as _ in  out intermittency _",
    "( see also brooke 1997 ) .",
    "the easiest way to characterise in  out intermittency is by contrasting it with on  off intermittency .",
    "briefly , let @xmath3 be the invariant subspace and @xmath4 the attractor which exhibits either on  off or in  out intermittency .",
    "one then has on  off or in  out intermittencies , depending respectively upon whether the intersection @xmath5 is a minimal attractor or not .",
    "the name in  out is chosen to be indicative of the fact that in this case there can be different invariant sets in @xmath6 associated with the attraction and repulsion transverse to @xmath6 .",
    "another crucial difference between the two is that , as opposed to on  off intermittency , in the case of in  out intermittency the minimal attractors in the invariant subspaces do not necessarily need to be chaotic and hence the trajectories can ( and often do ) shadow a periodic orbit in the ` out ' phases ( see ashwin _",
    "_ 1999 for details ) .",
    "given the genericity of the ingredients required for the presence of this type of intermittency , it is of interest to see if this type of behaviour can indeed occur in the context of dynamo models .",
    "interestingly , this form of intermittency has been concretely shown to occur in a number of dynamo models , including both ode ( covas et al . 1997c ) and pde ( covas et al .",
    "2000c ) mean field dynamo models .",
    "an example of such an occurrence is given in fig .",
    "[ inoutpde2 ] , where in  out intermittency occurs for an axisymmetric pde mean  field dynamo model ( see covas _",
    "( 2000d ) for details ) .",
    "# 1#20.7#1    we should add here that in addition to in  out intermittency , firm evidence has also been found for the occurrence of other forms of intermittency in mean field dynamo models .",
    "these include crisis ( or attractor merging ) intermittency , in both ode ( covas & tavakol 1997 ) and pde ( covas & tavakol 1999 ) dynamo models , and type i intermittency , in both ode ( covas _ et al . _",
    "1997c ) and pde models ( covas & tavakol 1999 ) .",
    "we further note that on - off intermittency ( platt _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 , see also schmitt _",
    "_ 1996 and ossendrijver 2000 ) is also likely to be relevant for such models , given their invariant subspaces .",
    "the demonstration of the occurrence of various form of intermittency establishes an important element of the _ multiple intermittency hypothesis _",
    "( tavakol & covas 1999 ) , according to which the grand minima type variability in solar - type stars may be understood in terms of one or a number of types of dynamical intermittency . what remains to be shown",
    "is whether these types of intermittency still persist in more realistic models and ultimately , through detailed comparison with observational and proxy data , whether they actually occur in the sun and stars , and whether they can in fact account for the grand minima type behaviour .",
    "the important point to be emphasised here is that in addition to theoretical predictions for these types of intermittency , their occurrence has been conclusively demonstrated not only in truncated dynamo models , but also in non - truncated pde dynamo models ( in three spatial dimensions , although so far restricted to axisymmetry , and time ) .",
    "an important outcome of the recent inversion of the helioseismic data has been to provide increasing evidence to show that the sun is likely to be very active dynamically throughout the convection zone .",
    "to establish firmly the precise nature of these variations , future observations are clearly required . however , despite the error bars that such inversions are bound to entail , the results so far seem to point to the very interesting possibility that the variations in the differential rotation can have different periodicities / behaviours at different depths in the solar convection zone , having either markedly reduced periods ( howe _ et al . _",
    "2000b ) or non  periodic behaviour ( antia & basu 2000 ) at the bottom of the convective zone .",
    "there are in principle two ways to account for such behaviours .",
    "one could imagine different physical mechanisms at different physical locations in the convection zone , resulting in different dynamical behaviours in those locations .",
    "alternatively , a dynamical mechanism could be sought that could produce such different behaviours at different spatial locations , without requiring different physical mechanisms at those locations .    as an example of the latter mechanism , spatiotemporal",
    "fragmentation / bifurcation has recently been proposed as a possible natural dynamical mechanism to account for such observed multi - mode behaviours in different parts of the solar convection zone ( covas _ et al . _",
    "in this way , dynamical regimes with different temporal behaviours can coexist at different spatial locations , for certain _ given _ values of the control parameters of the system .",
    "the important point here is that , in contrast to the usual temporal bifurcations , which result in identical temporal behaviour at each spatial point , and which require changes in parameters in order to be initiated , spatiotemporal bifurcations can result in different dynamical modes of behaviour at different locations without requiring changes in the control parameters . also , importantly",
    ", the occurrence of such diverse modes of behaviour does not require different physical mechanisms at different locations .",
    "evidence for the occurrence of this mechanism was found in the context of a two dimensional axisymmetric mean field dynamo model operating in a spherical shell , with a semi ",
    "open outer boundary condition , in which the only nonlinearity is the action of the azimuthal component of the lorentz force of the dynamo generated magnetic field on the solar angular velocity ( covas _ et al . _",
    "the zero order angular velocity was chosen to be consistent with the most recent helioseismological data ( mdi ) .",
    "subsequently it has been shown , through a detailed study ( covas _ et al . _",
    "2000c ) , that the occurrence of this type of behaviour does not depend upon the details of the model employed , thus providing strong evidence to support the idea that spatiotemporal fragmentation is likely to occur in general dynamo settings .    as an example of this type of spatiotemporal fragmentation / bifurcation , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ velocity_radial_latitude=30.pr=0.90 ] the radial contours of the angular velocity residuals @xmath7 , as a function of time for a cut at a fixed latitude .",
    "this demonstrates how , as a result of such spatiotemporal bifurcation , the period ( as well ads the phase ) of the angular velocity residuals vary going from the top to the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "the details of the model are given in covas _",
    "( 2000b , c ) .",
    "# 1#20.6#1    # 1#20.6#1    to show the the presence of the spatiotemporal bifurcation more clearly , we also studied the bifurcation diagram by calculating the time between the minima of @xmath8 , the perturbation to the zero order rotation rate at a fixed latitude and radius , as a function of time .",
    "[ periods.bifurcations.calpha ] shows an example of such bifurcation , demonstrating clearly a sudden bifurcation from a fundamental 11 year cycle to a cycle with two periods ( whose sum is 11 years ) .",
    "thus this mechanism is capable of producing different modes of behaviour at different locations , for given values of the control parameters of the system .",
    "we have briefly discussed a number of recent attempts at understanding two dynamical features observed in the sun ( and solar type stars ) , in terms of a number of novel concepts from nonlinear dynamics .",
    "a crucial feature of these types of explanation is that they are based on the nonlinear nature of the regimes under study , rather than on any specific physical mechanisms possessing the required time scale variabilities .",
    "this is important , particularly in view of the fact that much remains unknown about the underlying physics in these regimes .",
