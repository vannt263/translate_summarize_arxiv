    "binary stars , notably double - lined eclipsing binaries , are fundamental astrophysical systems whose study is key to obtaining accurate empirical measurements of stellar radii , masses , and temperatures .",
    "these precisely derived quantities are necessary for calibrating theoretical models of stars , and understanding stellar evolution . particularly valuable",
    "are well - characterized systems in either the pre - main sequence or post - main sequence phases where stellar evolution is more rapid , and fundamental calibrators correspondingly more rare relative to the main sequence . among pre - main - sequence stars ,",
    "fewer than 10 systems with masses below 1.5 m@xmath3 have published orbital solutions and fundamentally derived stellar parameters ; see @xcite and @xcite for reviews .",
    "the pleiades cluster ( d = @xmath4 pc ; @xcite and age = @xmath5 myr ; @xcite ) is well - studied and has sizable membership . at the upper end of the mass distribution the stars",
    "are slightly evolved , with a well - populated main sequence between @xmath60.5 and @xmath63 @xmath7 ( or m0 through b8 spectral types ) , and at lower masses the stars are still contracting as pre - main sequence objects . the @xmath0 phase of the kepler mission @xcite has observed @xmath6800 bona fide and candidate pleiads .",
    "we report here the detection of pleiades member hii 2407 as an eclipsing binary system , and make use of @xmath0 photometry and existing radial velocity measurements from the literature to derive an orbital solution and constrain the stellar parameters .",
    "mutual fitting of the data combined with assumptions based on available information about the early - k type primary suggests a mid - m type secondary . at the pleiades age ,",
    "the primary has arrived on the main sequence while the secondary is still pre - main - sequence .",
    "future observations will be needed in order to detect the spectrum of the secondary distinctly from that of the primary , rendering it a double - lined system and enabling a unique solution for the masses of the individual components .",
    "the observations took place during @xmath0 campaign 4 which ran from 2015 - 02 - 08 through 2015 - 04 - 20 utc .",
    "although we also produced our own light curve from aperture photometry , in our final analysis , we use the simple aperture photometry ( sap ) light curve available from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) , which we corrected for systematics and intrinsic stellar variability .",
    "the dominant characteristic of the @xmath0 light curve of hii 2407 is a variability pattern of @xmath62% amplitude caused by rotational modulation of star spots .",
    "primary eclipses of @xmath65% depth were detected by inspection of the raw light curve .",
    "following removal of the spot modulation pattern , a lomb - scargle periodogram analysis of the corrected light curve yielded an orbital period of 7.05 days .",
    "phase - folding the corrected light curve on this period then revealed secondary eclipses of depth @xmath8% .",
    "the light curve extends over @xmath671 days , with @xmath630 minute cadence , yielding ten 2015 epochs .",
    "in addition to the eclipses and star spot variability pattern , the light curve displays a saw - tooth - like pattern induced by the roll angle variations of the satellite .",
    "following @xcite , we model the spot- and roll- induced variations jointly , using a gaussian process ( gp ) model with three components : a time - dependent term to represent the spot modulation , a term depending on the star s position on the ccd ( as measured via the centroid ) to represent the systematics , and a white noise term .",
    "this enables us to subtract the systematics and , where appropriate , the spot - induced variability in order to study the eclipses .",
    "a detailed description of gp regression applied to @xmath0 light curve modelling is beyond the scope of this paper ; we refer the interested reader to @xcite and restrict ourselves here to the differences between the present analysis and that paper .",
    "the position component was two - dimensional , depending on the centroid @xmath9 and @xmath10 , rather than on a 1-d estimate of the roll - angle variations .",
    "the time component was modelled as quasi - periodic to reflect the periodic but evolving nature of the spot - induced variations ( see   [ sec : thestar ] for further discussion of the spot variability modeling ) .",
    "the eclipses were excluded when training the model , but we did use the model to predict and correct for the systematics and spot - modulations across the eclipses .",
    "finally , we included two change - points in the position component ( at @xmath11 and @xmath12 , each time the direction of the roll angle variations reverses ) : the systematics are treated as correlated between each pair of change points , but not across a change - point .",
    "we fit for the characteristic amplitude and length scales of the systematics and spot component , the period and evolutionary timescale of the latter , as well as the white noise standard deviation , by maximizing the likelihood subject to log - normal priors on the length scales and log - uniform priors on the other parameters .",
    "the priors used were broad enough that they do not affect the fit , merely restricting the model to physically plausible values . once the covariance parameters are set , we compute , for each cadence , the mean and standard deviation of the predictive distribution of the gp conditioned on the observations .",
    "we flag any observations lying more than three standard deviations away from the mean as outliers and repeat the fitting and prediction procedure to ensure the outliers did not affect the fit .",
    "the mean of the predictive distribution for the full ( systematics + spot ) model was subtracted from the data in order to model the eclipses , with the standard deviation of the same predictive distribution serving as our estimate of the photometric errors .",
    "these include the white noise term , plus additional errors arising from imperfections in the gp model s ability to reproduce the data .",
    "as one would expect , the errors are slightly larger during the eclipses , where the data was not used to constrain the fit .",
    "we also evaluated the individual systematic and spot components separately in order to produce a systematics - corrected light curve that preserves astrophysical variability .",
    "the systematics - corrected light curve , variability fit , and final light curve used in eclipse modeling are presented in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] .",

    "independent analysis of an @xmath18 spectrum over the range of 6450 - 6850   taken with wiyn / hydra in december 1999 produces an effective temperature estimate @xmath17=@xmath19 k. this result is based on measurement of 51 lines using the ares program , and is consistent with a k2 spectral type from the empirical relations of @xcite .",
    "the star is known as a variable , and was identified by @xcite to have 6707   absorption as well as weak h@xmath20 and triplet core emission , and as a weak x - ray emitter by @xcite  all signs of youth that are consistent with the properties of many other low mass pleiades members . from the hires spectrum , we measure ew(li ) = @xmath21 m .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams show the star to sit firmly on the main sequence with no photometric excess indicative of multiplicity .",
    "observations conducted with the palomar 60 `` telescope and the robo - ao instrument @xcite confirm that hii 2407 is an apparently single star at wide separations .",
    "no far - red optical companions are detected brighter than the @xmath22 contrast limits of 2 mag , 4.25 mag , and 5.5 mag fainter than the star at separations from the star of 0.5 '' , 1.5 `` and 3.5 '' , respectively .",
    "we use this information below to rule out any  third light \" contamination in the eclipse fitting part of our analysis .",
    "the star was classified as spotted by @xcite from analysis of its wasp light curve ( designation 1swasp j034942.26 + 242746.8 ) , but the eclipses were not identified by those authors .",
    "our reanalysis of the wasp light curve using the wasp transit - search algorithm confirmed the eclipses and yielded the following orbital ephemeris : @xmath23 consistent with our @xmath0-derived ephemeris , presented in table  [ table : orbitparams ] .",
    "however , hii 2407 was reported as a single - line spectroscopic binary by @xcite , who derived a 7.05 day orbital period with zero eccentricity .",
    "this period is the same as the 7.05 day eclipse period reported above from the @xmath0 analysis .",
    "below we combine absolute radial velocity measurements from table 7 of @xcite with the @xmath0 photometry to fit for the system orbital and stellar parameters .",

    "we evaluated the rotation period by modelling the out - of - eclipse light curve using a gaussian process ( gp ) model with likelihood :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is a vector of @xmath28 ( normalised ) flux measurements , and the elements of the covariance matrix @xmath29 are given by    @xmath30 - \\frac{(t_i - t_j)^2}{2l^2 } \\right\\ } \\\\",

    "this covariance function gives rise to a family of functions which display periodic but slowly evolving behaviour , and has previously been used to model the light curve of active stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the gp model was implemented in python using the george package @xcite . to speed up the computation ,",
    "the light curve was sub - sampled by selecting 500 data points at random . the posterior distribution for @xmath33",
    "was then evaluated ( while marginalizing over the other parameters ) using an affine - invariant markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) implemented in the emcee package @xcite .",
    "the priors used were uniform in natural log between @xmath37 and @xmath38 for all parameters , and we ran 36 parallel chains of 700 steps each , discarding the first 200 as burn - in .",
    "the resulting estimate of the rotation period is @xmath39 .",
    "our value is inconsistent with both the 7.291 day period previously reported by @xcite from hatnet and the 7.748 day period reported by @xcite from a fourier periodogram analysis of the superwasp archive .",

    "however , given that we know the primary exhibits significant spot activity with periodicity similar to that of the binary orbit , we consider the removal of these outliers a contrived choice .",

    "complicated patterns may arise during eclipses with contributions from both the background and foreground stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as such , we choose to include all observations from primary eclipse in our final fit and suggest that the increased scatter is likely due to spots .",

    "independent of the jktebop  analysis , we also modeled the light curve and radial velocities with phoebe @xcite .",

    "we set priors on the mass ratio and semi - major axis such that resulting masses would be consistent with the estimated values , but generally left them free to explore the degenerate parameter space .",

    "these differences suggest the statistical uncertainties we report in table  [ table : orbitparams ] may not reflect the true uncertainties .",
    "a possible etiology of this behavior is the reliance of phoebe on stellar atmospheres to convert surface brightness to @xmath17  at cool temperatures , in contrast to jktebop  which does not rely on such models .",

    "@xmath89 0.18@xmath400.02 m@xmath3(given the primary mass , and the best - fit radial velocity semi - amplitude and inclination ) . for these parameters and an assumed age of 120 myr , interpolation of ( * ?",
    "* hereafter bhac15 ) models predicts temperatures of @xmath90 k and @xmath91 k. the predicted flux ratio of this configuration is thus @xmath920.1 at 8000   or @xmath60.3 at 1.55  ( l. prato , private communication ) .",
    "detection of spectral lines from the secondary is likely possible in the infrared .",
    "jktebop  modeling suggests a luminosity ratio @xmath93 0.004 , which is consistent with the hires - determined upper limit on the optical flux ratio . for comparison , assuming an age of 120 myr and @xmath94 m@xmath3 , the luminosity ratio suggests @xmath950.11 m@xmath3 , from interpolation among either bhac15 or @xcite isochrones .",
    "we caution that this ratio is strongly dependent on the poorly constrained ratio of radii .",
    "the best - fit central surface brightness ratio corresponds to a temperature ratio of @xmath79 = 0.4953 @xmath40 0.0049 .",
    "this ratio suggests a secondary temperature of @xmath80 = 2460 @xmath40 90 , assuming a 3-@xmath35 error in the surface brightness ratio .",
    "we note this temperature is @xmath6500 k cooler than predictions from bhac15 or @xcite models for a star with the assumed secondary mass .",
    "the temperature ratio favored by phoebe , however , produces a secondary temperature that is in much better agreement with models .    the position of the secondary in the mass - radius plane relative to @xcite , bhac15 , and parsec v1.1 @xcite models ( see figure  [ fig : isochrones ] ) is consistent in each case with an age older than the nominal cluster age of 120 myr , but within error of the accepted value .",
    "the largest discrepancy is present in the bhac15 models , which imply a significantly older age for the secondary ( in other words , the bhac15 models overpredict the radius at a given mass , if the mass and radius are assumed correct ) . for the assumed cluster age ,",
    "the parsec models provide the closest match to our estimates of the secondary parameters .",
    "however , we note that given the large uncertainties , meaningful constraints on evolutionary models will be obtained only when secondary lines are detected and thus precise masses and radii for both components are measured directly .        regarding the near - coincidence of the binary orbital and the stellar rotational periods , the @xmath67 day rotation period of the primary is typical of single pleiads with masses in the range 0.6 - 0.8 m@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath60.4 day difference between the rotational and orbital frequencies corresponds to 0.048 radian / day .",
    "this is comparable to the equator - to - pole difference in rotational frequency found in doppler imaging studies of differential rotation in young k dwarfs of similar effective temperature @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the frequency difference is small enough that if the surface rotation of the primary is locked to the orbit at low latitude , and the spot activity is confined to higher latitudes , the observed frequency difference could arise from surface differential rotation .",
    "using equation 4.12 from @xcite for tidal synchronization due to eddy viscosity in a convective star with a tidal love number of order unity , we obtain a synchronization timescale @xmath96 years for the primary s rotation . while this estimate is somewhat uncertain , it indicates that the synchronization timescale for such a system should exceed the age of the cluster at rotation periods longer than 10 days .",
    "this is consistent with the studies of @xcite and @xcite , who found synchronized binaries in clusters of comparable age only at periods less than ten days .",
    "we conclude that there is good theoretical and observational support for the interpretation that the similarity between the orbital and photometric periods is causal rather than coincidental , and that the primary s rotation is tidally locked to the orbit .",
    "we report the discovery of pleiades member hii 2407 as an eclipsing binary .",
    "the star was known previously as a spectroscopic binary , and we used the literature radial velocities combined with new @xmath0 photometry to constrain the fundamental parameters of the system .",
    "we revised the spectral type of the primary , provided a new measurement of the rotation period , and demonstrated that the system is likely tidally synchronized .",
    "the companion is likely to be a mid - m type , and thus still a contracting pre - main - sequence star given the nominal cluster age .",
    "it is the first fundamental calibrator available in this mass and age range .",
    "follow - up infrared spectroscopy , where the flux ratio is more favorable relative to optical spectroscopy , is likely to reveal the lines of the secondary , allowing for dynamically measured masses and elevating the system to benchmark eb status .",
