    "classical novae are a subclass of cataclysmic variables in which a progenitor system increases in brightness by @xmath101020 mag over a period of days to weeks and then returns to its pre - outburst magnitude over a period of days to years .",
    "the progenitor system is a short period , semi - detached binary consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting material from a roche lobe filling late - type companion . if the accretion rate is sufficiently low , the accreted material forms a thin shell of degenerate matter on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "once the temperature and pressure at the base of the accreted envelope become sufficiently high , a thermonuclear runaway ensues , resulting in a nova eruption .",
    "novae can reach an absolute magnitude , @xmath11 , making them among the most luminous explosions in the universe , easily visible in galaxies as distant as the virgo cluster ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the nature of the progenitor system suggests that novae will be recurring events .",
    "once a nova eruption occurs the material will begin to build up again and the process will repeat .",
    "recurrence times can be as short as 1 year ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) all the way up to @xmath12 yr , or perhaps longer .",
    "despite the fact that all novae are believed to be recurrent , only novae with more than one recorded outburst are referred to as  recurrent novae \" . over time , the orbital period of a nova progenitor binary decreases as a result of angular momentum losses due to magnetic stellar winds from the tidally - locked donor star , or from gravitational wave radiation , or both . as the orbital period decreases ,",
    "so does the average accretion rate onto the white dwarf primary , resulting in an increase in the recurrence time @xcite .",
    "in addition , in a given stellar population , the average mass of the primaries in nova systems are expected to decrease with increasing time elapsed since the zero - age main sequence population formed @xcite . a less massive primary needs to accrete more material to reach the necessary temperature near its surface to undergo a thermonuclear runaway ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such systems will undergo less frequent ( and dimmer ) nova outbursts compared to systems with higher mass primaries @xcite .",
    "accounting for the above factors , population synthesis models have predicted that @xmath5-band luminosity - specific nova rates , @xmath13 , should be significantly higher in the younger populations found in spiral disks compared with older populations found in elliptical galaxies and in the bulges of spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . despite these predictions ,",
    "many nova surveys have found that , within observational uncertainties ( which can be large ) , @xmath13 appears to be relatively independent of hubble type ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , although some surveys have found evidence that @xmath13 varies between galaxies , though not necessarily as predicted by models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , nova surveys of m31 , in which nearly 1000 novae have been observed ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have repeatedly found that the nova spatial distribution is more centrally concentrated than the background light , indicating a higher @xmath13 in the bulge than in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "more recently @xcite have found a similar result for m81 . in light of the apparent discrepancy between theory and observation found in their early m31 survey",
    "@xcite suggested that a significant number of nova progenitor binaries may have formed in m31 s globular cluster ( gc ) population and been subsequently injected into the bulge through 3-body encounters within clusters , or through tidal disruptions of entire clusters , or both , thereby enhancing the bulge nova rate .",
    "it has long been known that the number of galactic low - mass x - ray binaries per unit mass are enhanced in gc environments @xcite , and it has been suggested that many galactic bulge x - ray sources could have had their origin in gcs @xcite .",
    "a similar enhancement of x - ray sources has also been seen in m31 s gc population @xcite . in recent years , it has been suggested that a significant population of close binaries with white dwarf accretors ( e.g. , nova progenitors ) could also be formed in the dense cores of gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observations by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) and chandra had already begun to reveal these binaries in galactic gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although there is no compelling evidence that they are enhanced relative to the field .    additional evidence for",
    "the idea that nova progenitors could be produced in gcs has come from the study of nova rates in virgo elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite reported that the nova rate in the giant elliptical galaxy m87 could be as high as @xmath14  yr@xmath15 , while for the slightly more luminous elliptical , m49 , @xcite found a rate of @xmath16 .",
    "it is interesting that , like the ratio of observed nova rates , m87 has a specific frequency of gcs about three times that of m49 @xcite .",
    "although , these results are consistent with the possibility that the large gc population of m87 enhances its nova rate , absolute nova rates extrapolated from observed nova rates are largely uncertain given the small spatial coverage of these hst surveys , and comparisons of these rates between surveys can be unreliable .    in 2011",
    "we began a definitive test of the putative relationship between a galaxy s gc specific frequency , @xmath0 , and its luminosity - specific nova rate , @xmath13 .",
    "specifically , we searched for novae in three essentially equidistant virgo elliptical galaxies having different gc specific frequencies .",
    "the galaxies were observed under nearly identical conditions using the same telescope , observing cadence , filters , and exposure times . with this approach",
    "we were able to simply compare the relative numbers of novae discovered in each of the three galaxies directly to estimate relative nova rates , while avoiding the large uncertainties that result when attempting to measure absolute nova rates for different galaxies in different surveys .",
    "preliminary results of our program were discussed in @xcite and @xcite . here , we present the final results of the first phase of our ongoing virgo galaxy nova study .",
    "we chose three virgo ellipticals for our study : m87 ( ngc 4486 ) , m49 ( ngc 4472 ) and m84 ( ngc 4374 ) .",
    "as members of the virgo cluster , these three galaxies are approximately equidistant .",
    "they also have similar luminosities , but they have widely varying gc specific frequencies , @xmath0 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we observed all three galaxies over four epochs from february 2011 to march 2012 using the canada - france - hawaii 3.6-m telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "all observations were made using the megacam which consists of a mosaic of 36 2048@xmath174612 pixel ccds covering a full field of view of @xmath18  deg@xmath19 at a resolution of 0.187@xmath20/pixel @xcite .",
    "exposure times were kept nearly constant between galaxies , varying only slightly due to weather in a small number of cases to ensure that the derived relative nova rates would be directly comparable .",

    "for nova surveys imaging in h@xmath1 has two principal advantages over broad - band imaging .",
    "novae exhibit strong h@xmath1 emission lines shortly after outburst that fade slowly relative to the continuum , typically requiring months to decline by more than 2 mag .",
    "the slow decay rate in h@xmath1 means that we can detect novae over a longer time interval , requiring less frequent temporal sampling .",
    "another advantage of h@xmath1 over broad - band observations , is that h@xmath1 images provide a greater contrast between novae and the bright galaxy background , resulting in increased survey completeness , particularly near the bright nuclei of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on the luminosity function of novae in both m31 and the galaxy , we estimate that approximately 50% of the virgo novae should reach a peak absolute magnitude , @xmath29 magnitude is defined on the ab system where @xmath30 for @xmath31  ergs  @xmath32  s@xmath15  @xmath15 . through a 76wide filter",
    ", this corresponds to a zero point flux of @xmath33  ergs  @xmath32  s@xmath15 . ] .",
    "assuming a distance modulus to the virgo cluster of @xmath34 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , we require observations that can reach @xmath35 . numerical simulations revealed that with a mean seeing of 0.8@xmath20 typical for the cfht we could detect a @xmath36 nova during grey time with a signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath37 , @xmath38 at @xmath39 from the center of its host galaxy and @xmath40 at @xmath41 from center in a one - hour exposure . to avoid saturation of the nucleus , and to enable the removal of cosmic rays hits , our 1  hr exposures were divided into 12 five - minute integrations .",
    "our complete survey was spread over four epochs of observations spanning two years .",
    "the first two epochs were separated by two months , which , given the persistence of the nova h@xmath1 emission , provides reasonable temporal coverage , with minimal overlap of detected novae .",
    "the third and fourth epochs were scheduled in the following year to ensure that we could discriminate between slowly evolving novae and other types of variable sources .",
    "given an estimate for the absolute nova rate in m49 ( 100  yr@xmath15 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we conducted a simulation to estimate the number of novae we could expect to observe in each epoch . in the simulation , we consider @xcite model for the brightness profile of the galaxy and then distribute artificial novae with a density that follows the background light .",
    "the peak brightnesses and fade rates for the artificial novae are based on h@xmath1 light curves of 14 novae observed in m31 @xcite and m81 @xcite , adjusted to the distance of the virgo cluster . given the temporal sampling , exposure times ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) and an estimate of the nova rate we compute the number of novae expected to be observed above a given @xmath37 . under the null hypothesis that the nova rate is independent of gc specific frequency , and scales directly with k - band luminosity , we would expect to observe 22 , 32 and 15 novae in m87 , m49 , and m84 , respectively with a @xmath42 . on the other hand , in the extreme ( and likely unrealistic ) case that _ all _ nova progenitors are formed in gcs , the number of novae expected scales directly with the gc specific frequency and the predicted rates were 86 , 32 and 7 novae for the three galaxies , respectively .",
    "in each observation , we positioned the target galaxy on the top of ccd chip 22 near the center of the megacam array .",
    "more than 99% of the total light from each galaxy falls on the same six central chips surrounding the nucleus ( chips 12 , 13 , 14 , 21 , 22 , 23 ) , and these chips were the focus of our analysis .",
    "the images were not significantly dithered , and so chip gaps of @xmath43 persist in the final images for each epoch .",
    "the area obscured by chip gaps is @xmath44 of the total survey area .",
    "however , due to the positioning of the target galaxies , no chip gaps are encountered within a radius of @xmath45 of the nuclei . using the same photometry used to plot the cumulative background light in figure 2",
    ", we estimate the light enclosed within this radius to be greater than 60% of the total light for all targets , leaving considerably less than @xmath46 of the light ( and likely the novae ) obscured by chip gaps .",
    "this loss is negligible compared to other uncertainties inherent in nova rate calculations , and we have not made any formal correction for it in the analysis .",
    "the megacam data come pre - processed with bad pixel masking , bias subtraction , and flat fielding being performed prior to the data release .",
    "once the pre - processed data were in hand , individual 5 minute exposures for each of the six central chips were spatially registered using the iraf routine wregister .",
    "the individual ccd images were then median stacked using the tasks imalign and imcombine to produce master images for each chip in each epoch , typically representing 60  min of total exposure time ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "finally , the wcs for each master image was recalibrated to match between epochs using the iraf task ccmap in conjunction with precise coordinates for several reference stars on each image obtained from the us naval observatory ( usno ) b1 catalog @xcite .      to identify nova candidates",
    "the master images were spatially aligned , point - spread function ( psf ) matched and differenced using the isis package @xcite . in the resulting images objects of variable brightness are conspicuous , allowing us to detect them by eye .",
    "variables qualified as nova candidates if they had an approximately gaussian psf , and if they were visible in only one or two consecutive epochs , but did not appear on both sides of the 10 month gap in observations .    within the inner @xmath47 of each galaxy center the differencing became less effective due to the increasingly bright background light .",
    "in an attempt to detect nova candidates in the inner regions we applied the iraf task median , which produced a smoothed approximation of the background light profile .",
    "stellar sources are not completely removed in the median smoothing process , but they are greatly reduced in amplitude .",
    "the resulting median image was then subtracted from the original to produce a background - subtracted image of the central region where stellar sources are easier to identify .",
    "the background - subtracted images from separate epochs were then compared to identify nova candidates .",
    "no new nova candidates were identified using this method , however we were able to confirm pre - existing candidates or in a couple of cases eliminate candidates due to non - stellar psfs first identified in the background subtracted images .",
    "all told , we have discovered a total of 27 , 37 , and 19 novae in the fields of m87 , m49 , and m84 .      to calibrate the nova h@xmath1 magnitudes",
    ", we began by performing aperture photometry using the iraf task phot to determine instrumental magnitudes for the nova candidates and several nearby reference stars from the usno b1 catalog , which were employed as secondary standards . for nova candidates close to the nucleus we needed to account for the steepness of the background light profile before we could perform accurate aperture photometry .",
    "to ensure that we were able to accurately measure the nova brightness , we pre - processed subimages centered on the nova using the task imsurfit , which excludes a small circular region surrounding the nova and then calculates and subtracts a fit of the background light .",
    "once instrumental magnitudes were in hand , standard ab magnitudes for the novae ( which correspond to monochromatic fluxes averaged over the h@xmath1 filter bandpass ) were estimated through differential photometry with respect to the known @xmath48-band magnitudes of the reference stars .",
    "conversion to a true h@xmath1 magnitude that would reflect the total nova emission at h@xmath1 would require a knowledge of the width of the nova h@xmath1 emission relative to the filter bandpass .",
    "since the former value varies from nova to nova depending on the expansion velocity of the nova shell , an accurate measure of a nova s h@xmath1 flux through filter photometry is not possible . for consistency with our earlier studies ,",
    "we assume a 100% filling fraction in the present analysis . in this case , the adopted nova h@xmath1 magnitudes are simply equivalent to standard ab magnitudes , with @xmath30 corresponding to @xmath49  ergs  @xmath32  s@xmath15  @xmath15 .",

    "the spatial positions of the novae detected in each of the three galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "given that the virgo galaxies are members of a rich cluster , it is possible that some fraction of the novae , especially those seen at a large distance from their putative host galaxy , may in fact be associated with nearby dwarf galaxies , or possibly with intracluster novae ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . to pursue this possibility further , and to explore how the nova populations are distributed in each of their host galaxies , in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we have compared the radial cumulative distribution of the novae with the cumulative distribution of the galaxy s background light using the @xmath57-band photometry of @xcite for m87 and m49 , and the @xmath58-band photometry of @xcite for m84 .",
    "the different bandpass used for the m84 photometry should not affect the analysis significantly given that color gradients in the virgo ellipticals are not appreciable ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "since our surveys were always incomplete within @xmath63 of the center of each galaxy , we can not address the possibility that the nova density is enhanced near the nuclei of the galaxies , as was suggested by @xcite in their _ hst _ study of novae in the inner regions of m87 , and by @xcite for m49 .",
    "if the number density of nova progenitor binaries is simply proportional to the number density of stars , we would expect the cumulative nova distribution as a function of isophotal semi - major axis to closely trace that of the galactic background light .",
    "based on an examination of the cumulative distribution plots , including their kolmogorov - smirnoff ( ks ) statistics , it appears that the density of novae follows the background light reasonably well . in the case of m87",
    "there seems to possibly be two separate populations present .",
    "the m87 distribution is smooth from the central region to @xmath64 , then there is a gap in the distribution followed by what appears to be an increase in the nova density at @xmath65 .",
    "a visual inspection of the m87 field reveals that within the region of this outer population several small neighboring galaxies are being included in the survey , such as ngc 4478 which by itself is @xmath66 the luminosity of m87 .",
    "one of the novae in the outer population lies within @xmath67 of ngc 4478 .",
    "there is also evidence for an extended halo surrounding m87 ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "we note , however , that because the peak luminosity of novae rival those of gcs it is very likely that some candidates in the most luminous gcs may be missed thereby underestimating the dynamical formation rate and the effect of gc mass ( and the closely connected dynamical interaction rate ) on nova formation .",
    "extragalactic studies of x - ray binaries in gcs have firmly established that they are three times more abundant in the metal rich population as compared to the metal poor one in the typical bimodal gc populations in galaxies , a surprising effect that was hinted at in early milky way and m31 observations @xcite .",

    "interestingly , based on the published metallicities or colors , of the 7 other likely or plausible nova gcs only two are likely to be metal rich .",
    "this may hint at the possibility that novae in gcs are not consistent with the metallicity effect seen in x - ray binaries .",
    "clearly no strong conclusions can be drawn form this heterogeneous set of observations with unknown biases .",
    "future systematic observations such as this study are needed to test the intriguing possibility that more massive neutron star and black hole binaries respond differently with metallicity than wd binaries .",
    "we have reported the results of a virgo cluster nova survey to test for a possible relationship between a galaxy s nova rate and its gc specific frequency . in our cfht survey spanning a total of 4 epochs over two years , we have discovered a total of 27 , 37 , and 19 novae in the fields of m87 , m49 , and m84 , respectively .",
    "these data have led to nova rate estimates of of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 per year , for the three galaxies . after considering the @xmath5-band luminosities of the galaxies ,",
    "we find similar luminosity - specific nova rates , @xmath13 , for m87 , m49 , and m84 of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 novae per year per @xmath84 @xmath116 .",
    "these values are at the high end of the range of @xmath117 novae per year per @xmath9 found by @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the m87 novae shows some evidence that the nova population could perhaps be separated into two distinct groups : that of an inner group which follows the background light out to a distance of about @xmath52 , similar to what is seen in m49 and m84 , and an outer group of 6 novae clumped between @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "as mentioned previously , m87 appears to have an extended halo of diffuse light that is populated with lower luminosity elliptical galaxies such as ngc 4478 .",
    "thus it is possible that some or all of the novae seen in the outskirts of m87 may not in fact be associated with m87 itself . if we restrict our analysis of m87 to the 21 novae with isophotal radii less than @xmath52 , we find that the cumulative distribution of novae closely follows the background light distribution . for this truncated sample ,",
    "we find a somewhat smaller nova rate of @xmath120 per year for m87 , corresponding to a luminosity - specific nova rate of @xmath121 , which is more in line with the values found for other galaxies .",
    "we have discovered two novae spatially coincident with known gcs : one in m87 and one in m84 . during the course of our survey a total of 83 novae",
    "were discovered in m87 , m49 and m84 , suggesting that gc novae could comprise @xmath122% of the novae seen to erupt in these galaxies .",
    "this estimate is likely a lower limit given the strong observational selection against the discovery of novae in the brightest clusters ( where they may be most likely to occur ) . taken together , the gc systems comprise only @xmath123% of the combined masses of the three galaxies . thus , taken at face value , it appears that novae may be enhanced by at least an order of magnitude in gc environments .",
    "additional monitoring of the gc systems of virgo ellipticals , in particular m87 , will be required before any definitive conclusions can be reached .    in summary ,",
    "the results of our survey are consistent with the hypothesis that the nova rates in the three virgo galaxies studied here are to first order simply proportional to their mass in stars . despite the detection of two novae associated with gcs in m87 and m84 suggesting that novae may be enhanced in gcs over the field",
    ", there is no compelling evidence that the overall nova rates in the virgo ellipticals are particularly sensitive to the their gc specific frequencies , which vary significantly between the three galaxies .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for constructive comments on our original manuscript .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained with megaprime / megacam , a joint project of cfht and cea / dapnia , at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) which is operated by the national research council ( nrc ) of canada , the institut national des science de lunivers of the centre national de la recherche scientifique ( cnrs ) of france , and the university of hawaii .",
