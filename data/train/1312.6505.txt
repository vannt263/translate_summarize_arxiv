    "the top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle and was discovered at the tevatron @xmath6 collider in 1995 by the cdf and dcollaboration @xcite with a mass around @xmath7 . at the tevatron",

    "the top quark has a very short lifetime , which prevents any hadronization process of the top quark . instead",

    "the total uncertainty from factorization and renormalization scale variation and pdf uncertainties is approximately 3.5% for the tevatron and approximately 4.3% at the lhc .",
    "the measurements presented here are performed using either the dilepton ( @xmath21 ) final state or the lepton+jets ( @xmath22jets ) final state , where @xmath23 can be an electron or a muon ( details on the lepton reconstruction can be found here @xcite ) .",
    "the branching fraction for top quarks decaying into @xmath24 is almost 100% . within",
    "the @xmath22jets  final state one of the @xmath25 bosons ( stemming from the decay of the top quarks ) decays leptonically , the other @xmath25 boson decays hadronically . for the dilepton final state both @xmath25 bosons decay leptonically",
    "the main background contribution in the @xmath22jets  decay channel originates from @xmath26jetsproduction , whereas the dilepton decay channel suffers most from contributions from @xmath27jetsproduction . at the lhc",
    "also single top quark production is one of the dominant background contributions for the @xmath21 and @xmath22jetschannel .",
    "jets originating from a beauty quark ( @xmath28-jets ) are usually identified by means of multivariate discriminants built by the combination of variables describing the properties of secondary vertices and of tracks with large impact parameters relative to the primary vertex . + the measured cross section can be calculated by using @xmath29 the number of observed data events @xmath30 is subtracted by the number of expected background events @xmath31 and then corrected for the detector efficiency @xmath32 and acceptance @xmath33 , the total integrated luminosity @xmath34 that corresponds to the selection requirements , and for the branching fraction @xmath35 into the decay channel under consideration .",
