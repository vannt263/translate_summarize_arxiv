    "the quantity @xmath10 is a lower barrier , @xmath11 is the mean - reversion rate , @xmath12 is the long - term mean , @xmath13 is the volatility - of - variance , @xmath14 $ ] is the correlation between the two underlying brownian motions , and @xmath15 is the interest rate .",
    "these quantities are all given and arbitrary .",
    "we remark that in practice the correlation @xmath16 is usually nonzero , and hence , ( [ heston ] ) contains a mixed spatial - derivative term .",
    "the heston pde is complemented with initial and boundary conditions which are determined by the specific option under consideration . in this paper",
    "we shall assume boundary conditions of dirichlet type .",
    "a widely known semi - discretization of pdes in finance is given by central second - order finite difference ( fd ) schemes , see e.g.  @xcite . to render the numerical solution of the heston pde feasible , the spatial domain is first restricted to a bounded set @xmath17\\times[0,v]$ ] with fixed values @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath19 chosen sufficiently large , with additional dirichlet conditions imposed at @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be any given integers and define spatial mesh widths @xmath23 the central second - order fd schemes for approximating the advection , diffusion and mixed derivative terms in ( [ heston ] ) are    [ sv ] ( u_s)_i , j & & , + ( u_v)_i , j & & , + ( u_ss)_i , j & & , + ( u_vv)_i , j & & , + ( u_sv)_i , j & & ,    with the short - hand notation @xmath24 and spatial grid points @xmath25 semi - discretization by ( [ sv ] ) of a given initial - boundary value problem for the heston pde leads to an initial value problem for a large system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , @xmath26 here @xmath0 is a given constant real @xmath27 matrix and @xmath28 ( for @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 are given real @xmath31 vectors with @xmath32 .",
    "the vector @xmath30 is directly obtained from the initial condition for ( [ heston ] ) , whereas the vector function @xmath33 depends on the boundary conditions . for each @xmath34 ,",
    "the entries of the solution vector @xmath35 to ( [ ode ] ) form approximations to the exact solution values @xmath36 for @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the aim of our paper is to gain insight into the stability of the semi - discrete pde ( [ ode ] ) . to this purpose , we are interested in the existence of useful , rigorous upper bounds on the quantity @xmath39 ( for @xmath40 ) where denotes an induced matrix norm . such bounds , on the magnitude of the matrix exponential of @xmath41 , guarantee that any ( rounding or discretization ) errors can not grow excessively .",

    "have not been obtained in the literature up to now for fd discretizations of the heston pde . in the present paper",
    ", we shall establish a natural extension of stability results derived in @xcite .",
    "we note that a main difficulty in proving this extension lies in the mixed derivative term in the heston pde , which does not arise in the black  scholes case .",
    "as the semi - discrete heston matrix @xmath0 is in general non - normal , bounds on the norm of @xmath44 which are based solely on the eigenvalues of @xmath0 are most often not useful . for the stability analysis in this paper , we shall employ the _ logarithmic spectral norm_. for any given complex @xmath45 matrix @xmath0 , with integer @xmath46 , it is defined by the limit @xmath47=\\lim_{t\\downarrow0}\\frac{||i+t a||_2 -1}{t}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the spectral norm and @xmath49 is the @xmath45 identity matrix .",
