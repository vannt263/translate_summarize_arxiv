    "in this paper , we studied the sequence of symmetry - breaking transitions at twin - boundaries in noncentrosymmetric superconductors .",
    "we found that the superconducting order may spontaneously break trs at the boundary if singlet and triplet pairing is of comparable magnitude , corresponding to the regime where a topological transition occurs .",
    "@xcite this symmetry breaking is associated with a nontrivial relative phase between singlet and triplet pairing order parameters . in the phase where trs is broken , the emergence of a supercurrent and a finite magnetization at the twin boundary is favored .",
    "both the supercurrent and the magnetization break spontaneously the inversion symmetry along the twin boundary , in addition to the already broken trs .",
    "our model for the twin boundary thus shows two consecutive breakings of @xmath1 symmetries , resulting in a total of @xmath201 degenerate low - symmetry states .",
    "one expects that these 4 states form domains along the twin boundary and are separated by topological defects that can only exist on the twin boundary .",
    "the topological defect associated with the first @xmath1 symmetry ( trs ) is a vortex that carries a fractional magnetic flux  @xcite , while the defect associated with the second @xmath1 symmetry ( inversion ) is a magnetic domain wall .",
    "we leave the investigation of the interplay of these defects as a subject for future studies .",
    "we observe that the spontaneous supercurrents and the spin magnetizations are always coupled to one another through the spin current at the twin boundary .",
    "this is not a feature exclusive to the topologically non - trivial phase , but occurs in a range of parameters on both sides of the topological transitions",
    ". the spin hall nature of this interrelation between spin - current , charge - current and the spin magnetization is the basis of many devices in spintronics .    on closing",
    ", we shall briefly relate to the experimental example of the orthorombic noncentrosymmetric superconductor lanic@xmath202 .",
    "muon spin rotation measurements showed that its superconducting state breaks trs ,  @xcite which raises the question about its pairing symmetry .",
    "symmetry arguments show that the `` usual '' form of a trs breaking superconducting phase is impossible , due to the lack of a degenerate multi - component order parameter . in analogy to our results for twin boundaries , one might speculate whether trs is not broken by the bulk pairing symmetry of the superconducting order parameter , but via local trs breaking bound states at defects  @xcite in this material .",
    "the fact that the trs breaking phase only appears as subsequent transition below @xmath90 is , however , in contradiction with the experimental observation that the intrinsic magnetism appears at the onset of superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank k. aoyama , p. brydon , s. fujimoto , j. goryo , c. iniotakis , d. manske , a.c .",

    "this work was supported in part by the swiss national science foundation , the nccr manep , and the pauli center for theoretical studies of the eth zurich .",
    "e.a . was supported by a grant - in - aid from jsps .",
    "these results were obtained from the free energy  , with the parameter values @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 . with this , we have chosen all those parameters pairwise equal , that multiply the equivalent terms of the singlet and triplet order parameter .",
    "deviations from this symmetric choice will shift the phase boundaries in the phase diagram , but its qualitative features are expected to survive ."
