    "this model intuitively gives rise to a degenerate spin ice ground state because of the equivalent energies of the six different tetrahedron configurations that make up the ground state of this geometrically frustrated unit .",
    "however , the nearest neighbor spin ice model is too simple to accurately describe the physical properties of real materials composed of the rare - earth ions ho@xmath19 and dy@xmath19 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "firstly , the magnetic cations ho@xmath19 and dy@xmath19 in ho@xmath20ti@xmath20o@xmath21 and dy@xmath20ti@xmath20o@xmath21 carry a large magnetic moment,@xcite @xmath22 , of approximately 10@xmath23 .",

    "indeed , the strength of the dipolar interaction at nearest neighbor distances , @xmath24 , is of order 2 k , which is of the same order of magnitude as the overall magnetic interaction energy scale in these materials as estimated by the curie - weis temperature , @xmath25 k , extracted from dc magnetization measurements .",
    "secondly , rare - earth ions possess very small exchange energies , which is roughly the same order of magnitude as @xmath26 and @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , dipole - dipole interactions in ho@xmath0m@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0m@xmath0o@xmath1 ( m = ti , sn ) are very significant and constitute an order one energy scale in the problem .",
    "this is the reverse of what is observed in transition metal compounds , where the exchange interaction predominates and the dipolar interaction can be treated as a very weak perturbation . finally , the nearest neighbor exchange interaction in ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is actually antiferromagnetic , which would by itself cause a phase transition to a nel long - range ordered @xmath27 state @xcite ( see fig .

    "it is useful to define an effective nearest neighbor energy scale , @xmath53 , for @xmath4 ising spins : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the nearest neighbor exchange energy between @xmath56 ising moments .",
    "this simple near - neighbor description of the system suggests that a @xmath56 ising system could display spin ice properties , even for antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor exchange , @xmath57 , so long as @xmath58 .",

    "dipole - dipole interactions are `` complicated '' : ( i ) they are strongly anisotropic since they couple the spin , @xmath37 , and space , @xmath64 , directions , and ( ii ) they are also very long - ranged ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "for example , the second nearest neighbor distance is @xmath66 times larger than the nearest neighbor distance , which means that the second nearest neighbor dipolar energy is @xmath67 .",
    "this implies an important perturbation compared to @xmath68 , especially for antiferromagnetic ( negative ) @xmath69 .",
    "specifically , for dy@xmath20ti@xmath20o@xmath21 , the second nearest neighbor energy scale is about 40% of the effective nearest neighbor energy scale , @xmath53 , a large proportion !",
    "therefore , one might have expected that the dipolar interactions beyond nearest neighbor would cause the different ice - rules states to have different energies , hence possibly breaking the degeneracy of the spin ice manifold , similar to what happens in the kagome @xcite and pyrochlore heisenberg antiferromagnets @xcite when exchange interactions beyond nearest - neighbor are considered . in eq .",
    "(  [ dsphamiltonian ] ) , if the dipolar term is summed beyond nearest neighbor , one could expect a long - ranged nel ordered state at a critical temperature @xmath70 . thus , here arises one of the main puzzling and interesting problems posed by the dipolar spin ice materials that can be summarized by two questions :    1 .",
    "are the experimental observations of spin ice behavior in real materials consistent with dominant long - range dipolar interactions ? 2 .",
    "if so , why do long - range dipolar interactions fail to destroy spin ice behavior and give rise to long - range order at a temperature @xmath70 ?",
    "results from monte carlo simulations on the dipolar spin ice model attempting to answer the first question above were first reported in ref .   and ref .  .",
    "in that work , the dipole - dipole interactions were cut - off at a distance of five @xcite or ten and twelve nearest - neighbors.@xcite in those studies the thermodynamic behavior was found to be consistent with spin ice behavior for a model of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , provided the exchange interaction was made to extend far beyond nearest neighbor,@xcite but not for a model of ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

( [ paulingent ] ) ) , in good agreement with experiments on dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( fig .  [ resent ] ) .",
    "following the same approach as in ref .  , recent monte carlo simulations have found good agreement between the dipolar spin ice model , specific heat measurements and elastic neutron scattering , as well as experiments on ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite finally , mean - field theory calculations of the neutron scattering intensity , valid in the ( paramagnetic ) temperature regime @xmath71 that consider large distance cut - off of the dipole - dipole interactions have been found to be in good agreement with experiments on ho@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite consequently , there is now strong compelling evidence that the long - range dipolar interaction is responsible for the ice behavior and the subsequent retention of zero - point entropy in rare - earth based insulating pyrochlore magnets.@xcite      having answered question # 1 above in the affirmative , one is then faced with addressing question # 2 .",
    "the monte carlo results mentioned above @xcite show that spin ice behavior arises from the combination of nearest - neighbor exchange , @xmath69 , and dipole energies , @xmath24 , which create an _ effective _ ferromagnetic ising model @xmath53 at nearest neighbor as long as @xmath72 , akin to harris and bramwell s simple nearest - neighbor ising model.@xcite however , the long - range dipolar interaction does not appear to destroy the spin ice degeneracy ( and subsequent retention of zero point entropy ) created by this effective ferromagnetic nearest neighbor interaction . in support of this picture , a mean - field theory ( mft ) calculation finds that remaining ( beyond nearest neighbor ) dipole - dipole interaction terms , which couple every spin in the system with varying strength depending on their separation distance , is `` screened '' to a large degree.@xcite this means that the degeneracy between different ice - rules obeying states is almost exactly fulfilled by carefully including the long distance dependence of the dipolar term in the hamiltonian .",
    "however , and perhaps most interestingly for these ising pyrochlore systems , the same mean - field calculation suggests that the screening of the long - range terms is not perfect , and that the associated spin ice manifold is only _",

    "@xcite consequently , akin to the approaches used in ice lattice models,@xcite one must introduce non - local dynamics in the simulation to combat this freezing - out and maintain simulation equilibrium down to lower temperatures . the inclusion of non - local `` loop moves '' in the dipolar spin ice model promotes the development of a long - range ordered phase via a sharp first order phase transition at @xmath77 k,@xcite a much lower temperature than the onset temperature for spin ice correlations at @xmath78 k in dy@xmath20ti@xmath20o@xmath21 @xcite and @xmath79 k in ho@xmath20ti@xmath20o@xmath21.@xcite the ground state found in the loop mc simulations has zero total ( bulk ) magnetization ( recall that each tetrahedron individually carries a net magnetic moment in each of the ice - rule obeying states ) .",

    "this is equivalent to simulating a long thin `` needle '' of the bulk material . however , if one wishes to simulate a material in which the unit cell has a net magnetic moment or internal demagnetizing fields , then we must modify the ewald sum to take into account the necessary boundary effects .",
