    "the motion of a fast electron beam across a periodic metal structure results in the radiation of electromagnetic waves .",

    "<S> a general electrodynamic theory of a grating coupled two dimensional electron system ( 2des ) is developed . </S>",
    "<S> the 2des is treated quantum mechanically , the grating is considered as a periodic system of thin metal strips or as an array of quantum wires , and the interaction of collective ( plasma ) excitations in the system with electromagnetic field is treated within the classical electrodynamics . it is assumed that a dc current flows in the 2des . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a propagation of an electromagnetic wave through the structure , and obtain analytic dependencies of the transmission , reflection , absorption and emission coefficients on the frequency of light , drift velocity of 2d electrons , and other physical and geometrical parameters of the system . </S>",
    "<S> if the drift velocity of 2d electrons exceeds a threshold value , a current - driven plasma instability is developed in the system , and an incident far infrared radiation is amplified . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the structure with a _ quantum wire grating _ the threshold velocity of the amplification can be essentially reduced , as compared to the commonly employed metal grating , down to experimentally achievable values . </S>",
    "<S> physically this is due to a considerable enhancement of the grating coupler efficiency because of the resonant interaction of plasma modes in the 2des and in the grating . </S>",
    "<S> we show that tunable far infrared emitters , amplifiers and generators can thus be created at realistic parameters of modern semiconductor heterostructures . </S>"
