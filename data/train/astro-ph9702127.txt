    "the chromospherically active binaries are detached binary systems with cool components characterized by strong chromospheric , transition region , and coronal activity .",
    "the rs cvn systems have at least one cool evolved component whereas both components of the by dra binaries are main sequence stars ( fekel et al .",
    "1986 ) .    in this series of papers we try to study the chromosphere of this kind of extremely active stars using the information provided by several optical spectroscopic features that could be used as chromospheric activity indicators .",
    "the simultaneous observations of different lines , that are formed at different height in the chromosphere ( from the region of temperature minimum to the higher chromosphere ) , are of special interest for stellar activity studies since they provide very useful information about this stellar region .",
    "ideally , simultaneous observations should be performed at all wavelengths in order to develop a coherent 3-d atmosphere model . in practice ,",
    "simultaneous observations of several activity indicators are rare and tend to focus on the same small number of extremely active systems .",
    "the best way to obtain the active - chromosphere contribution to some spectral line in the chromospherically active binaries is to subtract the underlying photospheric contribution using the spectral subtraction technique ( subtraction of a synthesized stellar spectrum constructed from artificially rotationally broadened , radial - velocity shifted , and weighted spectra of inactive stars chosen to match the spectral types and luminosity classes of both components of the active system under consideration )    the emissions in the ca  ii h & k resonance lines are the most widely used optical indicators of chromospheric activity , since their source functions are collisionally controlled and represent an extremely important cooling mechanism . in chromospheric active binaries the subtraction of the photospheric flux in this spectral region has been recently applied using the spectral subtraction ( see montes et al .",
    "1995c , 1996a and references therein ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 line is also an important chromospheric activity indicator , but it is only in emission above the continuum in very active stars , and in less active star only a filled - in absorption line is observed .",
    "so , to infer chromospheric activity level the spectral subtraction is needed ( see montes et al . 1994 ; 1995a ; b ; d , and references therein ; lzaro & arvalo 1996 ) .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed in the other balmer lines ( hall & ramsey 1992 ; montes et al .",
    "1995d ) .",
    "recently , the spectral subtraction technique has been used in other lines as the ca  ii irt , mg  i b , na  i d@xmath1 , d@xmath2 , and he  i d@xmath3 lines ( gunn & doyle 1996 ; gunn et al .",
    "the ca  ii irt lines are formed deeper in the atmosphere and are thus sensitive probes of the temperature minimum region .",
    "the na  i d@xmath1 , d@xmath2 lines are collision dominated and are good indicators of changes in the lower chromosphere .",
    "the mg  i b triplet lines are formed in the lower chromosphere and the region of temperature minimum and they are good diagnostics of photospheric activity ( basri et al .",
    "the he  i d@xmath3 line has been largely ignored as activity indicator ; however it could be a valuable probe of stellar activity and the observation of this line in emission supports the detection of flare like events ( zirin 1988 ) . in this first paper",
    "we focus our study on the analysis of the extensively used h@xmath0 chromospheric activity indicator together with simultaneous observations of the less studied he  i d@xmath3 and na  i d@xmath1 , d@xmath2 spectral features in a sample of 18 northern active binary systems selected from `` a catalog of chromospherically active binary stars ( second edition ) '' ( strassmeier et al .",
    "1993 , hereafter cabs ) . by using the spectral subtraction technique ,",
    "we have determined the excess emission in these lines and we have computed absolute chromospheric fluxes in h@xmath0 .",
    "the primary aim of this study is analyse in detail the excess h@xmath0 emission and to study the subtracted h@xmath0 line profile , especially in some extremely active stars which exhibit broad wings .",
    "moreover , we try to understand the behaviour of the he  i d@xmath3 and na  i d@xmath1 , d@xmath2 lines as chromospheric activity indicators taking into account the advantage that we simultaneously know the behaviour of the chromospheric excess h@xmath0 emission in these systems . in forthcoming papers we will analyze in detail several optical spectroscopic features using echelle spectroscopy in order to determine the effects of stellar activity on spectral lines originating at different heights in the chromosphere .",
    "another of our goals is to obtain information about the presence of extended matter ( prominence - like structures ) in the chromospheric active binaries using simultaneous h@xmath0 and h@xmath4 observations at near - eclipse orbital phases .    in sect .",
    "2 we give the details of our observations and data reduction . in sect .",
    "3 we describe the individual results of h@xmath0 , na  i d@xmath1 , d@xmath2 , and he  i d@xmath3 line observations of our sample . finally in sect .  4",
    "we discuss our results .",

    "the microflares are frequent , short - duration , energetically weak disturbances , i.e. they are the low - energy extension of flares , and therefore have large - scale motions associated that could explain the broad wings observed in these lines .",

    "other authors say that @xmath3110830 line is sometimes produced by the propagation of acoustic shock waves , or that he  i @xmath3110830 transition represents a wind diagnostic .",
    "some of the above proposed mechanisms could also be applied to the he  i d@xmath3 line .",
    "the na  i d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 lines are collisionally - controlled in the atmospheres of late - type stars and are formed in the lower chromosphere .",
    "so , the detection of filled  -  in absorption in the d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 lines may provide information about chromospheric emission .",

    "1997 ) .    in the sun , barrado et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and barrado ( 1996 ) have found changes in the ew of na  i lines in spectra taken at different regions over the solar surface , and a relation with the filled - in absorption h@xmath0 that might indicate that there is a non - radiative effect in the formation of these lines .    in other stars the d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 lines",
    "have been observed in emission or as a filled - in in very active red dwarf flare stars ( pettersen et al .",
    "1984 ; pettersen 1989 ) .",
    "however , no systematic study of these lines has been performed in stars with different levels of activity , and in chromospherically active binaries only the negative and uncertain detection of filled - in in the few active binaries er vul and gk hya , respectively , has been reported in the recent studies of gunn & doyle ( 1996 ) and gunn et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the application of the spectral subtraction technique in these lines is more difficult that in the h@xmath0 line , because their wings are very sensitive to the effective temperature , mainly in latter spectral types .",
    "therefore , small differences in spectral type , not appreciated in the h@xmath0 line , produce significant changes of the subtracted spectra in the wings of the na  i lines .",
    "moreover , in this spectral region there is a large number of telluric lines , and in the spectra of some stars interstellar na  i could be present .",
    "however , the distances of the majority of the stars is lower than 50 pc and the effect of the interstellar na  i is negligible .    in spite of this problems",
    ", some conclusions can be drawn . in the chromospherically active binaries analysed here",
    ", the spectral subtraction reveals that the core of the na  i d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 lines are filled - in by chromospheric emission in the more active star of the sample ( the star with h@xmath0 emission above the continuum , and with larger excess h@xmath0 emission ew ) .",
    "the stars with only a small or without excess h@xmath0 emission as bd cet , ay cet , v1149 ori and kt peg do not exhibit excess emission in the na  i lines .",
    "moreover , the excess d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 emissions obtained are larger in the systems with larger excess h@xmath0 emission , and also increase in the flares observed in ux ari and ii peg . in short , we can conclude that the filled - in of the core of the na  i d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 lines could be used as a chromospheric activity indicator .",
    "in this paper we have analysed , using the spectral subtraction technique , simultaneous h@xmath0 , na  i d@xmath1 , d@xmath2 , and he  i d@xmath3 spectroscopic observations of 18 chromospherically active binary systems .",
    "we have found excess h@xmath0 in all the systems , except kt peg which have also small emission in the ca  ii h & k lines .",
    "the subtracted h@xmath0 profile of the more active stars of the sample ( h@xmath0 in emission above the continuum ) has very broad wings , and is well matched using a two - components gaussian fit ( narrow and broad ) .",
    "the broad component is primarily responsible for the observed variations of the profile , and its contribution to the total ew increases with the degree of activity .",
    "so , we have interpreted this broad component emission as arising from microflaring activity that take place in the chromosphere of this very active stars .",
    "the h@xmath0 observation of the eclipsing binary system ar lac at orbital phase 0.939 , when a 0.33 fraction of the hot component is hidden by the cool component , allowed us to detect the presence of prominence - like extended material seen off the limb of the cool component through the detection of excess h@xmath0 absorption located at the wavelength position corresponding to the hot component . a small excess absorption in the he  i d@xmath3 line is also present at this orbital phase .",
    "the application of the spectral subtraction technique reveals that the core of the na  i d@xmath1 and d@xmath2 lines are also filled - in by chromospheric emission in the more active star of the sample .",
    "the stars with only a small excess h@xmath0 emission do not exhibit excess emission in the na  i lines .",
