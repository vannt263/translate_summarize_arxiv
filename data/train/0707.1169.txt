    "traffic congestions and the related problems such as traffic safety problems , environment pollution problems and energy crisis and so forth are significant for the national economy and the people s livelihood and commonly exist in most large cities all over the world . to uncover the traffic nature and clarify the occurrence of various phenomena in diverse road types , numerous researchers are devoted to developing traffic flow models . and",
    "substantial progress has been achieved in understanding the origin of many empirically observed features for roadways with mainly motorized vehicles(thereafter m - vehicle , including car , bus , truck ) or homogeneous traffic @xcite , primarily reflecting the traffic condition in developed countries .",
    "these achievements help to utilize efficiently limited construction budget and guide traffic planning and designing , management and control .",
    "the typical example is lincoln tunnel , where the flow goes up twenty percent after control . up to now",
    ", considerable attentions have been focused on traffic flow theory to provide reasonable advices on alleviating traffic congestion .",
    "however , in developing countries , e.g. china , india , bangladesh and indonesia @xcite , m - vehicles come in increasing numbers , and simultaneously nonmotorized vehicles(thereafter nm - vehicle , including bicycle , three - wheeler , motorcycle ) are still prevalent for most short - distance trips due to low income levels or convenient parking .",
    "thus , m - vehicles and nm - vehicles always blend on roads without isolations between motorized lanes(m - lane ) and non - motorized lanes(nm - lane ) or intersections .",
    "the mix traffic or heterogeneous traffic with both m - vehicles and nm - vehicles will persist for further years , since some governments advocate that citizens take bicycles for a short distance instead of driving cars to release issues on lack of energy and environmental pollution .",
    "it is noted that the mix or heterogeneous traffic in the following text means traffic with the mixture of m - vehicles and nm - vehicles .",
    "the chief difference between m - vehicles and nm - vehicles is that behaviors of m - vehicles are lane - based , while nm - vehicles do not follow each other within lanes but move in both longitudinal and lateral direction@xcite .",
    "the prominent characters of nm - vehicles are much flexible , low - speed and unsubstantial . when two kinds of vehicles mix somewhere , m - vehicles should concede nm - vehicles to guarantee the security of drivers of nm - vehicles . apparently , the mix traffic flow would be much more complicated than the homogeneous flow . in motorized traffic flow theory , there are mainly two kinds of microscopic traffic models , cellular automaton(ca ) models and car - following(cf ) models .",
    "it is reported that few devotes have been done on expanding these models into investigating the problem of the mixed traffic flow .",
    "inhomogeneous ca models based on non - identical particle size are presented to characterize the behaviors of vehicular movements in a mixed traffic environments with various motorized vehicles @xcite .",
    "the model applicable to the cases of car - bicycle following are investigated by faghri @xcite .",
    "oketch @xcite incorporated car - following rules and lateral movement to model mixed - traffic flow .",
    "wu and dai et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a ca model for mix traffic flow with m - vehicles and motorcycles . however , either ca models or cf models can not be suitable to exhibit both lane - based behaviors of m - vehicles and non - lane - based bahaviors of nm - vehicles . cho and wu @xcite proposed a model of motorcycles with longitudinal and lateral movement , and pointed out that this model could be the basis of bicycle or pedestrian flow model.obviously , it is inappropriate to directly extend motorized traffic flow theory into mixed traffic systems , because complicate interferences between m - vehicles and nm - vehicles can not be rightly described in the models for m - vehicles .",
    "it is a long - standing tradition to neglect the mix traffic mode that represents the status of transportation in developing countries . to get deep insights into the mixed traffic flow ,",
    "it is important to develop appropriate models describing the general feature of mix traffic flow and disclose the basic discipline , furthermore to enhance transporting efficiency in mix traffic systems and provide the firm infrastructure for the sustainable growth of national economics .    in the previous studies ,",
    "many works about mix traffic flow models were done on extending only one kind of motorized traffic models into describing the characters of heterogeneous vehicles .",
    "we think it is more reasonable for mix traffic flow models to integrate models for nonmotorized transportation modes with models for motorized modes .",
    "two key problems should be solved .",
    "one is how to choose suitably models that may be comparable , the other is how to establish the relationship among different types of models .",
    "as for the former , ca models may be good choices for m - vehices , owing to the relatively simple rules in expressions and better descriptions of most realistic traffic phenomena . at the same time , multi - value ca ( mca ) models developed by nishinari and takahashi @xcite can depict the multi - lane traffic without explicitly considering the lane - changing rule , and can be used to describe the non - motorized traffic flow .",
    "ca and mca models are similar in the following two aspects .",
    "both two models are discrete in the time and space , and states of vehicles are updated related rules in forwards motion .",
    "so the two models can be perfectly comparable . to solve the latter , identical dimensions of sites are used in different kind of ca models . in this paper ,",
    "the aim is to establish a novel approach for modelling mix traffic flow based on the combination of the ca model for motorized traffic flow and the mca model for non - motorized one .",
    "so it is referred as the combined ca ( cca ) model.the model is applied to simulate a special mixed system , where the bus stop inserted into the nm - lane , and nm - vehicles and m - vehicles mix near the stop .",
    "the simulation results indicate that the cca model can not only correctly character both nonmotorized and motorized transportation modes but also properly display their interactions .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to depict the chief properties of mix - traffic flow .    in this paper , we choose the typical nasch cellular automaton ( nca ) model @xcite for the ca model and the burgers cellular automaton ( bca ) model @xcite for the mca model .",
    "furthermore , other improved ca models and mca models or other suitable traffic flow models can be used in the proposed approach .",
    "the approach also can be generalized to other cases of the mixed traffic systems , such as the intersection , the roads without the isolation between the motorized lane(m - lane ) and the nonmotorized lane(nm - lane ) et al .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the mixed traffic system is introduced and the cca models is presented in section 2 .",
    "section 3 presents the simulation results and the discussions .",
    "finally , the summary and the further studies are addressed .",
    "the basic idea of the approach for modelling mix traffic flow is to unify mca models for m - vehicles with bca models for nm - vehicles .",
    "the main issues are to pick up models for two transportation modes and connect them to reflect interactions between two kinds of vehicles .",
    "since the ca and the mca model can reproduce basic phenomena of m - vehicles and nm - vehicles respectively and have the similar manner , it is expected that the two models can better be combined and their combination can exhibit the characteristics of both two kinds of vehicles . and",
    "special lane - changing rules between m - vehicles and nm - vehicles are designed to build up connections between two kinds of models and interactions among vehicles .",
    "then we present a simple model to characterize the traffic flow with the mixture of motorized and non - motorized vehicles .",
    "the new model , combined the nca and the bca model , is named as combined ca ( cca ) model .",
    "bus stops are essential infrastructures for public transport systems . in undeveloped countries ,",
    "most bus stops have no special stop bay , and are set on nm - lanes .",
    "thus , near these bus stops , buses occupy the nm - lane and block lots of nm - vehicles . according to rules for nm - vehicles in china @xcite , nm - vehicles",
    "is only permitted to run on nm - lanes , however nm - vehicles can employ the neighboring m - lane under the guarantee of safety when nm - vehicles on nm - lanes are blocked by hindrances .",
    "thus some nm - vehicles would rush into the adjacent m - lane if buses dwells at the stop on nm - lanes .",
    "the case mentioned above is a typical example for the mixed traffic flow . here",
    ", the mixed traffic system near these bus stops will be investigated .",
    "consider the mixed traffic system with two lanes including a nm - lane and a m - lane .",
    "the traffic system is sketched in fig .",
    "the road configuration with two lanes , is split into five sections , section a , b , c , d and e. section a and e are the entrance and exit region of the road , respectively .",
    "section c on the nm - lane is the bus stop .",
    "section b and d on the nm - lane are the upstream part and downstream part of the bus stop , respectively .",
    "each lane is divided into l sites with identical size , which are named as nca sites for nm - vehicles and bca sites and for m - vehicles , respectively .",
    "the uniform dimension of different sites can simplify the computation process .",
    "assume that each bca site can hold m nm - vehicles at most , and each nca site may be either empty or occupied by one m - vehicles .",
    "movement of vehicles includes forward motions and lane - changing motions .",
    "m - vehicles in nca sites move forwards according to the evolution rules of the nca model , and nm - vehicles in bca sites according to the rules of the bca model .",
    "the speeds of all vehicles are integer values .",
    "the maximal speed of m - vehicles(nm - vehicles ) is @xmath0(@xmath1 ) . in the following ,",
    "the variables with the superscript @xmath2(@xmath3 ) denote those of m - vehicles(nm - vehicles ) .",
    "the system contains two types of m - vehicles and one type of nm - vehicles .",
    "the m - vehicles have cars with one - site length and buses with two - sites length .",
    "the mixing probability @xmath4 stands the proportion of buses in m - vehicles .",
    "all buses must halt at the bus stop , and is called as stopping buses .",
    "@xmath5 denotes the dwell time of stoping buses at the stop .",
    "after the dwelling procedure , stopping buses is regarded as non - stop buses .",
    "the nca model is typically employed to control the forward motion of m - vehicles . at each discrete time",
    "step @xmath6 , the state of each vehicle is updated by the following rules @xcite :    1 .",
    "acceleration , @xmath7 ; 2 .",
    "deceleration , @xmath8 ; 3 .",
    "randomization , @xmath9 with probability @xmath10 ; 4 .",
    "motion , @xmath11 .    here ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the head position and velocity of m - vehicle @xmath14 in time step @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the number of empty sites between vehicle @xmath14 and its nearest preceding site occupied by vehicles .",
    "@xmath10 is the randomization probability in time step @xmath15 . for simplicity ,",
    "only the determined nca model with @xmath17 is used in the following simulations .",
    "if vehicle @xmath14 is the nearest vehicle behind the bus stop and a stopping bus , the gap @xmath16 is computed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the rightmost position of section c , namely the end of the bus stop .    for the stopping bus @xmath14 at the bus stop ,",
    "if its dwelling time @xmath20 is less than @xmath5 , then it continues to halt at the stop , and the dwelling time is updated as @xmath21 .",
    "otherwise , the bus becomes a non - stop bus .      in the bca model ,",
    "the lane - changing rule is neglected . for simplicity",
    "the maximal speed @xmath1 is set at @xmath22 .",
    "of course , other values for @xmath23 can also be considered , and the complexity of the computation increases .",
    "the number of vehicles in each site evolves as follows @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the number of nm - vehicles at site @xmath14 and time @xmath15 , @xmath26 .",

    "only nm - vehicles and buses near the bus stop are permitted to change lanes .",
    "buses in section b and c will change lanes asymmetrically . for simplicity ,",
    "the lane - changing rules similar to those for off - ramp traffic systems in ref.[12 ] are used in this paper .",
    "this is because the lane - changing behaviors of vehicles on the main road , which leave the main road and enter the off - ramp , are similar to those of buses entering and leaving the bus stop .",
    "the drivers of buses are willing to run on the nm - lane to stop conveniently when they are close to the bus stop .",
    "these buses will change from the left lane to the right lane as long as conditions on the right lane are not worse than those on the left lane .",
    "namely , if the following condition is satisfied@xcite , @xmath29\\ \\mbox { and } \\ d_{j , back}>v_{ob},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the stopping bus will change from the m - lane to the nm - lane with the probability @xmath30 in sections b and c. @xmath31 represents the number of empty sites between vehicle @xmath14 and its nearest preceding ( back ) unempty site on the destination lane at time @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath32 represents the velocity of its back vehicle on the destination lane , and @xmath33 when its nearest following vehicles are nm - vehicles .",
    "condition @xmath34 means that there is no gap to move forward on both lanes in the next time step ; condition @xmath35 means that the road situation on the present lane is not much better than that on its neighbor .",
    "if a stopping bus can not change to the destination lane , until it approaches @xmath19 , it would stop to wait for the change chance ( e.g. it will change the lane as soon as the corresponding position on its right - side lane is empty ) . in sections b and c , stopping buses are prohibited changing from the nm - lane to the m - lane .",
    "the bus that has finished the dwelling procedure will become a non - stop bus .",
    "the same lane - changing rules in eq.(2 ) are used for lane - changes of non - stop buses from the nm - lane to the m - lane in sections c and d. non - stop buses in sections c and d are forbidden changing to the nm - lane .",
    "if non - stop buses on the nm - lane still can not change to the m - lane , when it reaches the rightmost position of section d @xmath36 , it would stop to wait for the change chance mentioned above .",
    "cars are forbidden running on the nm - lane .    in sections",

    "@xmath38 is a safety distance to avoid crash , and is set to the maximal velocity of its back vehicle on the destination lane .",
    "under the situation that some nm - vehicles are running on the m - lane just in front of the current bca site @xmath14 , the possibility of the lane - changing behaviors of present nm - vehicles in site @xmath14 from the nm - lane to the m - lane may be increased , as long as the corresponding site on the m - lane still has space to hold nm - vehicles . because people would act in conformity with the majority .",

    "in addition , to guarantee the avoidance of complete congestion around the bus stop , the nm - vehicles of the site @xmath44 on the nm - lane will give way to stopping buses with the probability @xmath45 .",
    "the simulations are carried out under open boundary condition . in each time step ,",
    "when the update of m - vehicles on the road is finished , we check the positions @xmath46 of the last m - vehicles on the entrance of the m - lane . if @xmath47 , a m - vehicle with velocity @xmath0 is injected with the inflow rate @xmath48 at the site @xmath49 . on the nm - lane , if the first site is nt full filled with nm - vehicles , nm - vehicles are inserted with the probability ( inflow rate ) @xmath50 at the first site .",

    "according to the transit co - operative research program ( tcrp ) report 19 ( 1996 ) @xcite , the average peak - period dwell time exceeds @xmath67s per bus , so we set @xmath68s . the mix probability @xmath4 is @xmath69 .",

    "3(a ) ) , we find that a critical inflow rate @xmath78 ( @xmath79)(which is pointed out in fig.2(a)(fig.3(a ) ) only for @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) ) divides the flow into two regions , the free - flow one and the saturated - flow one .    1 .   in the region of @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) ,",
    "the flow of m - vehicles ( nm - vehicles ) is free and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) only depends on itself inflow rate @xmath84 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "2 .   in the region @xmath85",
    "( @xmath86 ) , the flow of m - vehicles ( nm - vehicles ) is saturated .",
    "the flow @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) is independent of itself rate @xmath84 ( @xmath50 ) , and reaches its saturation value @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",

    "this also can be obviously observed in fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , where the flow versus itself inflow rate @xmath84 ( @xmath50 ) in the cases of different @xmath50 ( @xmath84 ) is displayed . the saturated value @xmath87 and the critical value @xmath78 ( @xmath88 and @xmath79 ) decline from @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) at @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) to @xmath69 and @xmath95 ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) at @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the drop ratios of @xmath87 and @xmath88 are about @xmath100 percent and @xmath101 percent .",
    "this suggests that the mixture of the nm - vehicles and m - vehicles has a negative effect on the saturated flow of two flows which descends in a wide range .",
    "thus , in the proposed cca model , the phase transition from free flow to the saturation for both two flows is observed .",
    "and the flow @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) relies on not only itself inflow rate @xmath84 ( @xmath50 ) , but also @xmath50 ( @xmath84 ) . the mixture of the nm - vehicles and m - vehicles in the traffic system results in the drop of the saturated flows .",
    "therefore , the model can exhibit the interactions between nm - vehicles and m - vehicles in the mixed traffic system .",
    "it is interesting that the collective effect of the nm - vehicles and m - vehicles only appears when @xmath48 or @xmath50 surpasses its critical value .",

    "although the lane changing behavior of nm - vehicles from the nm - lane to the m - lane occurs and a short waiting queue forms upstream these nm - vehicles , the queue in the m - lane disappears within several time - steps .",

    "some nm - vehicles in the nm - lane accumulate behind the buses , and dissolve soon after the buses start to run due to low @xmath50 . but the lane - changing behaviors of these nm - vehicles strongly interrupt the movement of m - vehicles in the m - lane , and cause the reduce of @xmath87 .",

    "a nca site is defined as the site occupied by a m - vehicle , and updates according to the rules of nca model .",
    "a bca site contains a number of nm - vehicles , and its state evolves according to the rules of bca model .",
    "thus , the new model is convenient to perform on the computer .",
    "the model is applied to the mixed traffic system near the bus stop without the special stop bay , and special lane - changing rules are employed .",
    "firstly , for the nm - vehicles(m - vehicles ) flow , the phase transition from free flow to saturated flow can be observed at the critical value @xmath109(@xmath79 ) . according to the two critical values , the phase diagram in ( @xmath50,@xmath48 ) space",
    "is categorized into four regions , including region @xmath103(where both two flows are free ) , region @xmath104 ( where the flow of nm - vehicles is saturated , and that of m - vehicles is free ) , region @xmath105 ( where the flow of m - vehicles is saturated , and that of nm - vehicles is free ) , and region @xmath106(where both flows reach the saturations ) . secondly , to measure the total flow of the mixed traffic system , a total flow ratio @xmath115 is introduced . according to the characteristics of @xmath115 , region @xmath104 and @xmath105 in the space of ( @xmath50,@xmath48 )",
    "can be separated into two parts further , where the @xmath115 has a increasing or decreasing tendency due to the mixture of two flows , respectively . from these",
    ", it can be inferred that the proposed cca model could reflect feature of mixed traffic flow very well , and has great potentials on the practical application .",
    "it is noted that to improve the proposed model for mix traffic system and validating experimentally it , empirical data investigation and related calibration are in progress .",
    "the work is only the first step towards understanding characters of mixed traffic flow .",
    "there are numerous aspects that require further investigation , such as how to apply the proposed method in intersections and other traffic conditions to model mix traffic flow , how to consider the pin - effects of nm - vehicles and differences among various types of vehicles , how to improve negative effects induced by mixture of nm - vehicles and m - vehicles etc .",
    "we are planning to address these issues in our future work .",
