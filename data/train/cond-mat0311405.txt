    "the periodic anderson model ( pam ) is one of the basic models largely used in the study of strongly correlated systems whose properties can be described at the level of two effective bands , like heavy - fermion systems @xcite , intermediate - valence compounds @xcite , or even high critical temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "the model contains a free @xmath4 band hybridized with a correlated system of @xmath2 electrons for which the one - site coulomb repulsion in the form of the hubbard interaction is locally present .",
    "seen from the theoretical side , pam has the peculiarity that even its one dimensional hamiltonian is sufficiently complicated to not allow the knowledge of its exact solutions even in 1d . as a consequence ,",
    "taking into account that the exact description possibilities increase in difficulty with the increase of the dimensionality of the system in the physical region @xmath5 , the physics provided by pam is almost exclusively interpreted based on approximations .",
    "this situation enhance the difficulty of a good quality theoretical analysis , since exact bench - marks in testing the approximations or numerical simulations are almost completely missing .",
    "because of this fact , even the starting point of the theoretical description , the knowledge of the ground - state is poorly developing . given by this , efforts have been made for the construction of exact ground - states at least in restricted regions of the parameter space . in this frame ,",
    "based on the observation that the infinitely repulsive case in relative terms is easier to treat , the first exact ground - states have been deduced at @xmath6 , in restricted regions of the parameter space , based on a work of several years @xcite .    the first exact ground - states at finite value of the interaction have been published recently in 1d @xcite , and 2d @xcite , respectively .",
    "these ground - states emerge on continuous but restricted regions of the @xmath7 phase diagram of the system which extend from the low @xmath1 limit up to the high @xmath1 limit as well .",
    "these solutions have been obtained by a decomposition of the hamiltonian in positive semidefinite operators ( pso ) as follows ( i ) the interaction term has been transformed into a pso requiring at least one @xmath2 electron on every lattice site @xcite , and ( ii ) the remaining parts of the interaction term together with the one - particle components of the hamiltonian have been transformed in pso based on cell operators , using bonds in 1d @xcite or elementary plaquette operators in 2d @xcite .",
    "two type of ground - states have been obtained in this manner : localized and itinerant once .",
    "the itinerant solution was found to emerge for imaginary hybridization matrix elements ( @xmath8 ) , while the localized solution for real @xmath8 .",
    "besides , the itinerant solution has been obtained only in the presence of anisotropic or distorted unit cells .",
    "the cell operators used in the transformation of the hamiltonian had always the extension of an unit cell ( elementary plaquette in 2d ) , the @xmath2-creation operators being , , uniformly  considered , acting on all lattice sites of the elementary plaquette .",
    "we must note , that all exact ground - states deduced up today for pam at finite value of the interaction @xmath1 , based on the cell operators mentioned above , require the presence of the direct hopping @xmath9 as well in the correlated @xmath2 band of the hamiltonian , since the products of these cell operators leading to pso generate always @xmath9 contributions .",
    "the presence of the direct @xmath2 hopping can be argued based on experimental data in the case of @xmath10 @xcite , or some heavy - fermion compounds @xcite , but it remains in fact an extension term to the generic pam hamiltonian which does not contain such type of contributions . particularly for 2d , since for the @xmath11 limit the results deduced in refs.[@xcite ] are no more valid , the case of the generic pam hamiltonian treated in exact terms remains still a completely open problem .",
    "driven by the challenge to obtain exact solutions for the generic pam in 2d , the first questions which have to be clarified in these conditions are the following : can we consider the ground - states deduced for pam at finite @xmath1 in the presence of direct @xmath2 hopping in the hamiltonian also potential ground - states for the generic pam at finite @xmath1 ( and @xmath11 ) ?",
    "the unit cell distortions and imaginary hybridization matrix elements are essential for the emergence of itinerant phases ?",
    "this questions are important , since are connected to main problems related to pam , for example the localized vs. itinerant behaviour of @xmath2-electrons , and of particles in general in the system @xcite , or the interpretation of the pam behaviour based exclusively on the local @xmath2-moment and its compensation ( analyses made based on kondo physics ) .    starting from this background , in this paper we are reporting the first exact ground - states for generic pam in 2d at finite value of the interaction . as a consequence",
    ", the deduction is made without the presence of the direct hopping terms for @xmath2 electrons in the hamiltonian of the model ( @xmath12 . the obtained exact ground - state is itinerant , emerges for real values of the hamiltonian parameters ( including the hybridization matrix elements as well ) , is not necessarily connected to distorted unit cells and presents clear similarities in its physical properties with the itinerant solution obtained in the presence of direct @xmath2 hopping terms in @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "since the momentum distribution function is continuous without any non - regularities in its derivatives of any order , the presented ground - state is a non - fermi liquid state in the normal phase , possesses a large spin degeneracy , and globally is paramagnetic .    in order to deduce the reported results ,",
    "major developments have been applied in comparison with the plaquette operator method used in ref.(@xcite ) and described in detail in ref.(@xcite ) , which has been generalised to a block operator procedure .",
    "the introduced block is qualitatively different from the elementary plaquette previously used since a ) it has an extension greater than an unit cell and b ) it contains @xmath2 creation operators acting only on one unique central site of the block .",
    "this choice allows us to represent the pam hamiltonian in term of pso block products even in the absence of the direct @xmath2 hopping terms and to obtain non - localized ground - states in the presence of real hybridization matrix elements and absence of lattice distortions .",
    "all these are not possible to obtain in the frame of refs.[@xcite ] .",
    "the consequences of the presented results are multiple .",
    "( i ) at the level of exact solutions in 2d , the difference between the case @xmath9 and @xmath14 in @xmath13 , ( at least at the level of known exact ground - states ) seems to not be extremely significant .",
    "physically this can be understood based on the hybridization term which allows the movement of @xmath2-electrons even if direct hopping in the correlated band is not present in @xmath13 , and , in fact for the behaviour of the system ( and also the ground - state ) , not the bare bands are important but the diagonalized once . for the presented case the @xmath15 value seems only to shift the position in the parameter space of the emerging phase in comparison with the @xmath11 situation , without changing essentially its physical properties .",
    "( ii ) the fact that similar phases are obtained in exact terms for @xmath9 and @xmath11 as well shows that pam can provide a behaviour different from kondo physics .",
    "the statement is underlined as well by the absence of the exponential contributions characteristic for a kondo type of behaviour in the exactly deduced ground - state energy values ( see for example ref .",
    "this possibility in fact exceeds the vicinity of a metal - insulator transition mentioned from this point of view in ref.(@xcite ) since the presented phase diagram region extends continuously from the low @xmath1 limit to the high @xmath1 limit as well , up to @xmath16 .",
    "( iii ) combining the here obtained result with the results previously deduced , we observe that the delocalization of the electrons in pam can emerge simply because in this manner the system decreases its ground - state energy . there are situations ( depending on the parameters of the starting hamiltonian)@xcite when long - range density - density correlations are developing creating a localized phase , maintaining localized as well the @xmath2 electrons within the system . when the delocalization occurs , the long - range density - density correlation is lost .",
    "( iv ) we learn that using different type of blocks in constructing block operators in the process of the decomposition of the hamiltonian into products of positive semidefinite terms , different classes of hamiltonians can be analysed .",
    "the block form , its extension , the uniform or non - uniform nature of the operator action inside the block , the type of dependence of the numerical coefficients entering in the block operator on the physical parameters ( like spin ) , all are important in this description process . based on this degree of freedom",
    ", the method can be applied as well in the absence of direct @xmath2-hopping terms as well .",
    "( v ) it becomes clear that in conditions in which the hamiltonian remains hermitic , the real or imaginary ( or even complex ) hybridization matrix elements could provide similar physical consequences .",
    "the nature of these matrix elements is given by the symmetry @xcite , and in fact imaginary hybridization matrix elements has been used previously as well ( see for example @xcite ) . ( vi )",
    "the non - fermi liquid properties present in rigorous terms in the pam phase diagram , at least in 2d are not essentially connected to imaginary hybridization matrix elements , nor direct @xmath2 hopping in the hamiltonian , nor the presence of distorted unit cells .",
    "the remaining part of the paper has been constructed as follows .",
    "section ii . presents the model and its description with block operators , sect.iii . describes the deduced exact ground - state",
    ", sect.iv presents the conclusions , and appendix a. containing mathematical details closes the presentation .",
    "we start with a generic pam hamiltonian taken for a 2d lattice in the form @xmath17 where , the first term gives the kinetic energy for @xmath4-electrons , the second term is the on - site @xmath2-electron energy , the third term represents the hybridization , and the interaction term @xmath18 describes the on - site hubbard interaction written for @xmath2 electrons @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 being considered during this paper . as it can be seen , direct @xmath2-band is not present in the starting hamiltonian .    for technical reasons ,",
    "we transcribe @xmath13 in @xmath22 space , using for the operators @xmath23 the fourier sum @xmath24 . for this",
    ", we take into consideration at the level of the hybridization term , local ( @xmath25 ) and non - local ( @xmath26 ) nearest - neighbour contributions as well .",
    "the @xmath4-electron dispersion is taken into account including contributions up to next nearest - neighbour hoppings , which is not unusual in the case of the study of real materials @xcite .",

    "let us introduce connected to every site @xmath37 of the lattice the block @xmath38 as presented in fig.1 .",
    "it contains the lattice sites @xmath39 , being centred on the site @xmath37 .",
    "the numbering of the sites inside the block is block independent and given by the numbers @xmath40 in fig .",
    "1 . the site - numbering inside the block is considered block - independent given by the translational symmetry of the system .",
    "starting from the block @xmath38 we are introducing block operators as a sum of fermionic operators acting on the sites contained in @xmath38 as follows @xmath41 where the @xmath42 and @xmath43 prefactors are numerical coefficients . taking a block operator centred on another site @xmath44 , the indices of the fermionic operators follow the indices of the new sites @xmath45 , but for the numerical prefactors of @xmath46 we are keeping the same strategy in notation : @xmath47 represents the centre of the block , the index @xmath48 is of the site at the bottom of the block , the notation inside the block continuing anti clock - wise at the border of the block from @xmath49 up to the index @xmath50 .",
    "the block operator @xmath51 used in the present description has significant differences in comparison to the plaquette operators used previously @xcite .",
    "its novelty is twofold : ( i ) the here introduced block operator contains @xmath2-fermionic operators only in its unique central site , so contains a non - homogeneous f - operator action inside the block , and ( ii ) the number of lattice sites per block being @xmath52 , the used block has an extension greater than an unit cell .",
    "these are key features which allow the study of the pam hamiltonian without the presence of the direct hopping terms at the level of @xmath2-electrons .    summing up now @xmath53 over all lattice sites and taking periodic boundary conditions into account in both directions ( for the result see appendix a. ) ,",
    "the following relation is obtained @xmath54 \\ : , \\label{h9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the following equalities are present between the parameters of @xmath13 and the numerical prefactors of the block operators @xmath51 @xmath55 taking into account that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 represents the number of lattice sites , the hamiltonian from eq.([h6 ] ) becomes @xmath58 where @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 the hamiltonian contained in eq.([h11 ] ) will be analysed in detail below .",
    "we mention that the transformation of the starting @xmath13 from eq.([h6 ] ) to the studied @xmath13 from eq.([h11 ] ) is possible only if the hamiltonian parameters ( considered known variables ) satisfy the equations eqs.([h10 ] , [ h12 ] ) . on their turn , eqs.([h10],[h12 ] ) determine the unknown block operator parameters @xmath61 in term of hamilton operator parameters that must be considered known variables .",
    "this works only for the case in which @xmath13 from eq.([h6 ] ) can be written in the form of @xmath13 presented in eq.([h11 ] ) .",
    "since the number of unknown variables is less than the number of hamiltonian parameters , solutions for the block operator parameters will be present only if some inter - dependences between @xmath62 are present .",
    "these inter - dependences fix the parameter space region @xmath63 in which the here obtained results are valid ( see fig",
    "the explications from sect.iii.b . ) .",
    "we are studying the hamiltonian from eq.([h11 ] ) at a fixed number of particles @xmath64 in the system . as a consequence ,",
    "since @xmath64 is a constant of motion , @xmath13 becomes @xmath65 , where the positive semidefinite operator @xmath66 has zero minimum eigenvalue , and the constant @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 . in these conditions , the ground - state wave function of the model inside @xmath69 is defined via @xmath70 . to find @xmath71",
    ", we have to keep in mind that @xmath72 requires for its minimum ( and zero ) eigenvalue at least one @xmath2-electron on every lattice site , and that the introduced block operators satisfies the following properties @xmath73 starting from eq.([h13 ] ) we observe that the block operator part of eq.([h11 ] ) applied to @xmath74 gives zero .",

    "is the first exact ground - state obtained for generic pam at finite @xmath1 . the product in eq.([h14 ] ) must be taken over all lattice sites . because of this reason , the product of the creation operators in eq.([h14 ] ) introduces @xmath79 particles into the system , so @xmath71 corresponds to @xmath80 filling .",
    "all degeneration possibilities of the ground - state are contained in eq.([h14 ] ) , since the wave function with the property @xmath81 at @xmath80 filling always can be written in the presented @xmath71 form .",
    "we however underline that pam contains two hybridized bands , and @xmath80 filling for a two - band system means in fact half filled upper hybridized band ( the lower band being completely filled up ) .",
    "we mention , that @xmath71 describes rigorously only the @xmath21 case , since the presence of the @xmath82 operator into the ground - state is just required by the non - zero @xmath1 value . as a consequence ,",

    "we are now interested to find the @xmath7 phase diagram region where the solution from eq.([h14 ] ) is valid .",

    "given by the arbitrary nature of the @xmath76 coefficients , @xmath71 possesses a large spin degeneracy in the total spin of the system , being globally paramagnetic .    studying the particle number distribution on different sites created by the @xmath108 product over the creation operators in @xmath71 from eq.([h14 ] ) together with the concrete block operator presented in eq.([h8 ] )",
    ", it turns out that the obtained ground - state wave - function contains different contributions with one , two and three particles per site in the lattice . as a consequence",
    ", the system described by @xmath71 is not characterised by an uniform particle distribution , the expectation value of the hopping matrix elements and non - local hybridizations is non - zero , so the system is not localized and the electrons in the ground - state are itinerant .",

    "the second relation from eq.([a6 ] ) is trivial from physical point of view since the lower band is completely filled up .",
    "contrary to this , the first relation ( see fig .",

    "the deduced phase is present also in the isotropic case ( @xmath128 ) , and we underline that the result has clear physical signification even in the case in which @xmath69 behaves complete repulsively from rg point of view @xcite .    the novelty of this result in comparison with the behaviour reported in @xcite is threefold : ( i ) here we are situated in generic pam ( i.e. @xmath14 ) ; ( ii ) the hybridization matrix element is real ; and ( iii ) distorted unit cell is not necessary for the emergence of the itinerant phase . as a consequence ,",
    "the presence of the deduced behaviour is much more general then suggested by our previous work .    expressing @xmath129 from eq.([a3 ] ) , and using eq.([a6 ] ) , all needed ground - state expectation values connected to @xmath13 in term of the starting fermionic operators can be deduced . introducing the notation @xmath130 based on eq.([a7 ] ) it can be checked that @xmath131 and @xmath132 as well are free from non - regularities in the whole first brillouin zone .",
