    "the subject of atomic systems under spatial confinement is of immense interest among the researchers since the advent of quantum mechanics as the spectral characteristics of atomic systems placed under different confinements change appreciably compared with those of free atoms @xcite .",
    "a number of phenomenological potentials have been used to model atoms within cavities @xcite , atoms under pressure @xcite , impurities in quantum dots or nano crystals @xcite , nanopores @xcite , fullerenes @xcite and foreign atoms in liquid helium environment @xcite _ etc_. the study of quantum dots ( qd ) has got considerable attention in recent times due to its fundamental importance in theoretical researches as well as in fabricating new functional devices .",
    "the qd s ( or artificial atoms ) , in general , contains several electrons subjected to an external confining potential and they show similar structural properties as compared to pure atoms .",
    "the structural changes of the impurity atoms inside qd s _ w.r.t . _",
    "the parameters of confining potentials provide huge physical insight about the interaction of the atom with its surroundings .",
    "although the bound states of confined hydrogen and helium atoms have been studied extensively by several researchers @xcite , very few attempts have so far been made towards the quasi bound or resonance states of one electron impurity atom in an isolated qd @xcite and also in case of confined two electron systems @xcite .",
    "transformations of two - electron bound states to feshbach and then to shape resonances depending upon a parameter of model rectangular well - type potential representing the qd have been studied by bylicki _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and genkin _ et .",
    "@xcite showed that the singly excited bound states of a two - electron atom become resonance states for appropriately chosen parameters of an external attractive spherical gaussian type confining potential used to model the qd .",
    "+ in the present work , we have considered a spherically symmetric finite oscillator potential @xcite of the type , @xmath16 for modeling the qd confinement . here",
    "@xmath17 is the depth of the potential well and the cavity constant @xmath18 is defined as , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the width of the potential . by tuning the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath20 one can change the shape of the potential given by equation ( 1 ) . such type of two - parameter ( @xmath17 and @xmath20 ) potential provides much control and flexibility in modeling the size of a qd . when @xmath21 _ i.e. _ near the center of qd , @xmath22 and thus a harmonic nature is observed in the potential for a given cavity constant @xmath18 .",
    "but for large ` _ _ r _ _ ' , it deviates from the harmonic behavior .",
    "in fact , the fo potential is quite similar in profile to that of gaussian potential . at the same time",
    ", it facilitates the computation of matrix elements in a simple and efficient manner , especially when the slater - type orbitals are used in constructing the wave function with appropriate boundary conditions for a confined system .",
    "this fo potential was used by winkler @xcite to study the two - electron bound and resonant states of helium in qd where the electron correlation was not included initially in the optimized wave function .",
    "even the inclusion of electron correlation could not remove the uncertainties in their calculations @xcite .",
    "later , kimani _ et .",
    "@xcite applied the restricted hartree - fock method to estimate the ground states of many - electron close - shell quantum dots modeled by the fo potential where the electron correlations were included approximately .",
    "chakraborty and ho @xcite made a sophisticated approach to deal with this problem by expanding the wave function in single exponent hylleraas type basis within the framework of stabilization method , but their work was restricted to only the lowest lying doubly excited resonance state @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) of helium .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that an appropriate knowledge of resonance structure of few - electron qd with and without a central impurity atom will help to understand the electron transport phenomena occurring in real semiconductor qds @xcite .",
    "+ under such circumstances , we have studied the resonance parameters of @xmath1 states originated from @xmath3 and @xmath5 [ @xmath4 configurations of qd confined helium below @xmath6 ionization threshold of @xmath7 in the framework of stabilization method @xcite by using explicitly correlated multi - exponent hylleraas type basis set .",
    "this method was successfully employed by the present workers @xcite for calculations of resonance parameters of different resonance states of the free and confined helium - like ions . in the present study ,",
    "the resonance parameters of the states under consideration are estimated over a wide range of width ( @xmath20 ) for a fixed depth ( @xmath17 ) of the fo potential .",
    "the energy values of bound @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) states [ @xmath2 have also been been reported .",
    "moreover , the positions of @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) states of @xmath30 have been estimated for a comprehensive understanding about the structure of qd confined helium .",
    "the variation of ionization potential of qd confined _ he _ with respect to the width of the fo potential have been studied .",
    "it has also been shown that the potential given by equation ( 1 ) breaks the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath31 ) degeneracy in coulomb field for the energy levels of hydrogen - like atoms .",
    "finally , we have shown that for a fixed cavity depth ( @xmath17 ) , the widths of the resonance states show oscillatory behavior with respect to the width ( @xmath20 ) of the quantum cavity .",
    "it has been noted that for higher excited states , such oscillations are more pronounced .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : a brief discussion on the present methodology is given in section ii , followed by a discussion on the results in section iii , and finally concluding in section iv with a view towards further use of the present techniques in related studies of spatially confined atomic systems _",
    "e.g. _ qd , presuure confinement , scp confinement _",
    "for any @xmath32 state of even parity arising from two electrons having same azimuthal quantum number , the variational equation @xcite can be written as , @xmath33 dv_{r_{1},r_{2},\\theta_{12 } } = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] subject to the normalization condition , @xmath34 where the symbols used in equation ( 3 ) and equation ( 4 ) are the same as in reference @xcite .",
    "the effective potential is given by , @xmath35+\\frac{1}{r_{12 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the multi - exponent correlated wavefunction @xcite considered in the present calculation is expressed as , @xmath36 { \\nonumber}\\\\ & + & \\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}\\left[\\eta_{i}(1)\\eta_{j}(2)\\sum_{l\\geq 0}\\sum_{m \\geq 0}\\sum_{n\\geq 0}c_{lmn}r_{1}^{l}r_{2}^{m}r_{12}^{n}+ exchange \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath37 where , @xmath38 s are the non - linear parameters . here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the radial co - ordinates of the electrons and @xmath41 is the relative distance between them . in a multiexponent basis",
    "set , if there are @xmath42 number of non - linear parameters , then the number of terms in the radially correlated basis is @xmath43 and , therefore , the dimension of the full basis ( @xmath44 ) including angular correlation will be @xmath45 $ ] , where @xmath46 is the number of terms involving @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "for example , as we have used here nine non - linear parameters , the number of terms in the radially correlated basis is 45 and with 10 terms involving different powers of @xmath41 , the dimension of the full basis ( @xmath44 ) becomes 450 .",
    "the values of the non - linear parameters are taken in a geometrical sequence : @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the geometrical ratio @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction can be squeezed or can be made more diffuse by changing the geometrical ratio ( @xmath48 ) keeping @xmath49 constant throughout . to have a preliminary guess about the initial and final values of nonlinear parameter @xmath38 , we optimize the energy eigenvalues of @xmath1 states below @xmath50 ionization threshold of @xmath51 by using nelder - mead procedure @xcite .",
    "the energy eigenroots are then obtained by solving the generalized eigenvalue equation , @xmath52 where , @xmath53 is the hamiltonian matrix , @xmath54 is the overlap matrix and @xmath55 s are the energy eigenroots .",
    "the wavefunction is normalized for each width ( @xmath20 ) of the fo potential to account for the modified charge distribution inside the qd .",
    "each energy eigenroot plotted against the geometrical ratio ( @xmath48 ) produces the stabilization diagram .",
    "subsequently , we can calculate the density of resonance states from the inverse of tangent at different points near the stabilization plateau in the neighborhood of avoided crossings for each energy eigenroot .",
    "the plot of calculated density of resonance states versus energy for each eigenroot is then fitted to a standard lorentzian profile .",
    "the best fit , _",
    "i.e. _ , with the least chi square ( @xmath56 ) and the square of correlation ( @xmath57 ) near unity yields the desired position ( @xmath58 ) and width ( @xmath59 ) of the resonance state .",
    "+ for each width ( @xmath20 ) of the confining potential , the energy eigenvalues of @xmath60 and @xmath61 states of the confined one - electron @xmath7 ion is obtained by using ritz variational technique considering the wavefunction as , @xmath62 where , @xmath63 s are the nonlinear parameters and @xmath64 s are the linear variational coefficients . for @xmath7(@xmath65 ) states [ @xmath66 , we have considered 14-parameter basis set whereas for @xmath7(@xmath67 ) state we have taken 13 parameters in the basis . in both the cases , @xmath31 is ranging from 0 to 4 .",
    "all calculations are carried out in quadruple precision .",
    "atomic units have been used throughout unless otherwise specified .",
    "to construct the stabilization diagram corresponding to each width ( @xmath20 ) of the fo potential , repeated diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix in the hylleraas basis set of 450 parameters is performed in the present work for 400 different values of @xmath48 ranging from 0.63 @xmath68 to 0.77 @xmath68 for a depth @xmath17 = 0.2 @xmath68 and a width @xmath20 = 4.0 @xmath68 of the confining potential , a portion of the stabilization diagram for @xmath1 states of confined helium below @xmath6 ionization threshold of @xmath7 is given in figure-1 .",
    "it is evident from figure 1 that there exist two classes of states :    1 .",
    "first few energy eigen - roots lying below @xmath69 [ @xmath70 a.u . ] level are insensitive with the variation of @xmath48 .",
    "this feature clearly suggests that these energy eigen - roots originating from @xmath0 configurations of qd confined helium are bound _",
    "i.e. _ stable against auto - ionization .",
    "energy eigen - roots lying between @xmath69 and @xmath71 [ @xmath72 a.u . ] are sensitive with the variation in @xmath48 and gives rise to flat plateau in the vicinity of avoided crossings of the energy eigenroots in the neighborhood of some particular energy values .",
    "this is a clear signature for the presence of @xmath1 resonance states of qd confined helium .",
    "the present calculated bound state energy eigenvalues ( @xmath73 ) of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) [ @xmath74 states of @xmath75 as well as the @xmath69 energies for different cavity widths ( @xmath20 ) starting from a very low value of 0.001 a.u .",
    "( corresponds to almost a free case ) to a high value of 1000.0 a.u .",
    "are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "it is to be noted that for very small cavity width @xmath76 , the @xmath0 [ @xmath2 energy eigenvalues of helium and the @xmath69 threshold energy are nearly identical to the corresponding energy eigenvalues of the free ions and they remain almost unaltered upto the cavity width @xmath77 a.u .",
    "we can see from equation ( 1 ) that , for @xmath78 , @xmath79 and thus , @xmath80 which produce no effect of confinement . in between @xmath77",
    "a.u . and 10.0 a.u .",
    ", the energy eigenvalues of helium decrease monotonically and ultimately saturates at ( @xmath81 ) a.u . in a similar fashion , the threshold energy @xmath69 saturates at ( @xmath82 )",
    "this feature is physically consistent as we can note from equation ( 1 ) that for @xmath83 , the cavity constant @xmath84 , so that @xmath85 . thus the one and two electron energy levels will undergo a downward shift by @xmath17 and 2@xmath17 respectively for @xmath86 .",
    "the variation of the ionization potential ( in ev ) _",
    "i.e. _ the energy required to ionize one electron from the ground state ( @xmath87 ) of helium atom is plotted against the width ( @xmath20 ) of the cavity in figure 3 . in accordance with the variation of energy eigenvalues of helium and its one - electron subsystem , it is evident from figure 3 that , the ip is identical with the vacuum ip for low values of @xmath20 while for high values of @xmath20 , it increases by an amount @xmath88 ev .",
    "it is thus evident from figures 2 and 3 that rate of variation of energy values of the ions are significant when the size of the confining cavity is of the order of atomic dimensions .",
    "it is also remarkable that the stability of an impurity atom can be controlled by suitably tuning the size of a qd _ i.e. _ the depth and width of the representing cavity .",
    "+ an enlarged view of the stabilization diagram ( given in figure 1 ) for @xmath1 states of @xmath75 within the energy range @xmath89 a.u .",
    "to @xmath90 a.u . is given in figure 4 .",
    "the @xmath1 states of @xmath75 below @xmath6 ionization threshold of @xmath71 can arise due to @xmath3 and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) configurations . from a closer look at figure 4",
    ", we can see that for a short range of @xmath48 , each eigenroot between @xmath50 and @xmath93 ionization thresholds of @xmath7 becomes almost flat in the vicinity of avoided crossings in the neighborhood of different energies . in order to calculate the exact resonance parameters ,",
    "the density of states ( dos ) @xmath94 is calculated by evaluating the inverse of the slope at a number of points near these flat plateaus of each energy eigenroot using the formula @xcite given by : @xmath95 the estimated dos @xmath96 is then fitted to the following lorentzian form @xcite @xmath97 where , @xmath98 is the baseline background , @xmath99 is the total area under the curve from the baseline , @xmath100 gives the position of the center of the peak of the curve and represents the full width of the peak of the curve at half maxima . among different fitting curves for each eigenroot corresponding to a particular resonance state , the best fitting curve",
    "i.e. _ with least @xmath101 and the square of correlation ( @xmath57 ) closer to unity @xcite leads to the desired resonance energy ( @xmath100 ) and width ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the evaluation of dos following the fitting procedure has been repeated for each width of the confining potential ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "for example , the calculated dos and the corresponding fitted lorentzian for the @xmath23 ( @xmath1 ) resonance state of @xmath75 below @xmath69 threshold for cavity width @xmath103 a.u .",
    "( given in figure 5 ) yields resonance position @xmath100 at @xmath104 a.u . and",

    "it is clear from figures-6 and 7 that for @xmath20 = 0.001 a.u .",
    ", the @xmath7 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath67 ) states are degenerate and coincide with the energy value of @xmath6 ionization threshold of free @xmath7 ion . as @xmath20 increases , the @xmath7 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath67 ) states become non - degenerate .",
    "initially , the @xmath106 level of @xmath30 lies energetically below the @xmath67 level for @xmath107 up to 0.5 a.u . at @xmath107 = 1.0 a.u .",

    "_ ' takes place for @xmath106 and @xmath67 states of @xmath30 at some value of @xmath107 between 0.5 and 1.0 a.u .",
    "and then a ` _ _ level crossing _",
    "_ ' occurs between two states having different symmetry properties .",
    "finally these states become degenerate again for @xmath108 a.u . the incidental degeneracy for @xmath71 and",
    "@xmath109 states occur for @xmath20 in the range @xmath110 .",
    "such incidental degeneracy and subsequent level crossing phenomenon are being noted earlier by sen _ et .",
    "@xcite in case of cage confined hydrogen atom and by bhattacharyya _",
    "@xcite in case of helium - like ions within strongly coupled plasma environment .",
    "it is seen from both figures-6 and 7 that all the resonance energies ( @xmath100 ) are almost unaltered up to @xmath20 = 0.5 a.u .",
    ", then decrease rapidly up to @xmath20 = 20.0 a.u . and ultimately saturates . for low values of @xmath20 ( say 0.001 a.u .",
    ") the resonance energies are identical with those of the free _ he _ atom whereas for @xmath20 = 1000.0 a.u .",
    "the resonance energies are equal to those of free _ he _ atom plus 0.4 a.u .",
    "( @xmath111 2.0@xmath112 ) .",

    "_ @xmath20 are given in figures-8 and 9 respectively .",
    "a closer look at the figures 8 and 9 leads us to the following observations .    1 .",
    "in general , it can be argued that the variation of widths shows an oscillatory behavior which are more pronounced for the higher excited states .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here that recently chakraborty and ho @xcite also reported such oscillation of resonance width ( @xmath102 ) for @xmath23 ( @xmath32 ) state of qd confined helium atom .",
    "this feature clearly indicates a possibility of controlling the autoionization lifetime of doubly excited states of two - electron ions by tuning the parameters of the confining fo potential representing the quantum dot .",
    "the variations of widths of @xmath23 and @xmath114 ( @xmath24 ) states with respect to @xmath20 are exactly opposite in nature . for @xmath24 state originating from @xmath23 configuration ,",
    "the autoionization width first decreases in the range @xmath115 and after reaching the minima , it shows a large bump around @xmath116 6.0 a.u .",
    "after that it starts to decrease and finally the autoionization width saturates where it becomes equal to that of a free _ he _ atom .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath114 state , the autoionization width first increases for @xmath117 and then shows a large dip approximately at the same value of @xmath20 for which the @xmath23 state shows the bump .",
    "3 .   the values of @xmath20 corresponding to the largest bump in the values of autoionization widths ( @xmath102 ) of @xmath3 states and the lowest dip for @xmath5 states shift towards the higher values of the cavity width ( @xmath20 ) for higher excited states .    inside the qd _",
    "i.e. _ due to the presence of the surrounding fo potential , the charge distribution of the impurity ion gets reoriented which produces the behavioral changes as compared to a free ion .",
    "the nodes or antinodes of the resonance wavefunction lie at the boundary of the qd cavity and the interference caused inside the cavity gives rise to the oscillatory behavior of the resonance widths @xcite .",
    "the number of nodes or antinodes of the wavefunction increases for high - lying resonance states and the oscillation becomes more prominent .",
    "structural properties of he atom confined in a qd , efficiently modeled by a two - parameter weakly confining fo type potential , has been investigated in the framework of stabilization method using explicitly correlated hylleraas - type basis sets .",
    "it has been observed that the structure of the impurity ion is a sensitive function of the dot size .",
    "for very small values of the cavity width , the system behaves almost like a free ion whereas , for very high cavity widths , a constant shift equal to the depth of the potential are observed in the bound as well as resonance energies .",
    "when the dot size becomes comparable to the dimensions of the impurity atom , the effects are more pronounced and many remarkable behaviors such as increase in ionization potential , oscillations in the widths of two - electron resonance states , incidental degeneracy and subsequent level - crossing phenomena for one - electron ions are observed .",
    "the present work is expected to lead to future investigations on the autoionizing states of different angular momenta for qd confined two - electron systems .",
