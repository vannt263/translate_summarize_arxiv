    "scattering is assumed to be elastic and spin conserving . for a simple model we consider scatterers to be represented by gaussian model potentials of width @xmath184 , i.e. , @xmath185 .",
    "here we study small scatterers , where the spread of the potential is still larger than the lattice constant , but much smaller than the inverse of the wave vector amplitude : @xmath186 . in this limit",
    "the explicit @xmath187-dependence can be neglected and the scattering cross section simplifies to @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the scattering angle .",
    "the remaining dependence @xmath190 is the signature of the berry phase of the quasi particles .",
    "note that @xmath191 , where @xmath192 , also implies that intervalley scattering can be neglected . according to fermi s golden rule",
    "the scattering rate form @xmath161 to @xmath183 is proportional to the density of states at the outgoing momentum @xmath193 .",

    "this suggests the following expression for the scattering rate for small scatterers in bilayer graphene with finite trigonal warping , @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the normalization , @xmath198 the total scattering rate and @xmath199 the angular dependent density of states as given by eq .",

    "<S> ( [ eq : tausapproxrep ] ) is @xmath134 .    at 5@xmath133k </S>",
    "<S> the bias voltage of 50@xmath133mev is significantly larger than the thermal energy ( @xmath135mev ) and the fermi energy of 67@xmath133mev reasonably well above @xmath79 . at room temperature ( @xmath136mev ) </S>",
    "<S> the thermal energy is comparable with both , thus making the zero temperature estimate very approximate . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the experimental data shows a stronger correlation @xmath137 at room temperature .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the spin relaxation time in bilayer graphene in dependence of the fermi energy and interlayer bias potential . </S>",
    "<S> these two parameters can be tuned independently with top and back gates . </S>",
    "<S> using experimentally determined parameters and making reasonable assumptions for the unknown values of @xmath15 and @xmath29 , we obtain good agreement with the existing experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong dependence of the spin relaxation time on externally applied fields that may have applications in field - controlled spin valve devices .    </S>",
