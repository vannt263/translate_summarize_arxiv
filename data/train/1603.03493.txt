    "several studies have revealed that most globular clusters ( gcs ) with ages of @xmath01 - 2 gyr in both magellanic clouds ( mcs ) exhibit either a bimodal or extended main - sequence turn - off ( hereafter emsto , bertelli et al.2003 ; mackey & broby nielsen 2007 ; glatt et al.2009 ; milone et al.2009 ; correnti et al.2014 ; goudfrooij et al.2014 ) .",
    "this feature of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) has suggested that emsto gcs have experienced a prolonged star - formation history with a duration of @xmath0100 - 500 myrs ( e.g.mackey et al.2008 ; rubele et al.2013 ; goudfrooij et al.2011 ) and that these clusters could be the younger counterparts of the old galactic gcs with multiple populations ( keller et al.2011 ; conroy & spergel2011 ) . the possibility that intermediate - age gcs host multiple stellar populations with different ages has been further supported by the presence of either extended or dual red clumps that indicate that these stellar systems are not consistent with a single isochrone ( girardi et al.2009 ) .",
    "an alternative scenario has been proposed by bastian & de mink ( 2009 ) who have suggested that the emsto is due to stellar rotations in clusters where a single stellar generation exists ( see goudfrooij et al.2014 , niederhofer et al.2015 and references therein for discussions ) .",
    "yang et al.(2011 ) have suggested merged binary systems and interacting binaries with mass transfer can be responsible for both the emsto and the dual clumps .",
    "more recently , an emsto has been detected for the first time in the @xmath0300-myr old cluster ngc1856 in the lmc by milone et al.(2015 ) who have provided the first evidence that this cmd feature is not a peculiarity of intermediate - age clusters ( see also correnti et al.2015 ) .",
    "furthermore , ngc1856 exhibits a split ms , with the blue ms hosting about one third of the total number of ms stars ( milone et al.2015 ) .",
    "this finding reveals that young clusters with emsto and split ms may provide strong constraints to discriminate between age and rotation .",
    "indeed , rotational models predict that the blue ms would evolve into the faint msto , while in the case of an age spread , in a young cluster we still have a split of the upper ms but the blue ms would be connected to the bright part of the msto .",
    "unfortunately , the connection between stars along the two mss and the emsto of ngc1856 is unclear and the cmd of this cluster has been interpreted in terms of both a difference in age ( milone et al.2015 ; correnti et al.2015 ) and with two coeval stellar populations with different rotational velocity ( dantona et al.2015 ) .",
    "noticeably , a split ms has been previously observed in the @xmath0100-myr old lmc cluster ngc1844 ( milone et al.2013 ) but in this case there is no evidence of an emsto .    in the present paper",
    "we exploit high - precision photometry from the _ hubble space telescope _ of the even younger cluster ngc1755 in the lmc .",
    "ngc1755 , with an age of @xmath080 myr , is indeed a particularly interesting object to investigate the morphology of the ms and msto in very young clusters .",

    "the main dataset used to investigate the multiple stellar populations in ngc1755 consists of images taken with ultraviolet and visual channel of the wide field camera 3 ( uvis / wfc3 ) on board of _ hst_. specifically , we have used 2@xmath1711s images collected through the f336w band and 90s@xmath2678s images collected through the f814w band of uvis / wfc3 as part of go14204 ( pi.a.p.milone ) .",
    "in addition we have used two archive images taken with the wide field channel of the advanced camera for survey ( wfc / acs ) of _ hst _ ( go9891 , pi.g.gilmore ) through the f555w ( 50s ) and the f814w filters ( 40s ) .",

    "the red circle has a radius of 40 arcsec and delimits a region mostly populated by cluster members that we will call the ngc1755 field .",
    "the green rectangles mark two regions where the contamination from ngc1755 is negligible and have , in total , the same area as the ngc1755 field .",

    "we have corrected the stellar positions for geometrical distortion by using the solution provided by bellini , anderson , & bedin ( 2011 ) for uvis / wfc3 and by anderson & king ( 2006 ) for wfc / acs .",
    "photometry has been calibrated into the vega - mag systems as in bedin et al.(2005 ) and by adopting the zero points provided by the stsci web page for wfc3/uvis .",
    "we have used several indexes provided by the software as diagnostics of the photometric and astrometric quality ( anderson et al.2008 ) and we have selected a sample of relatively isolated stars with small astrometric and photometric errors , and well fitted by the psf . we refer to sect.2.1 of milone et al.(2009 ) for details .          artificial stars ( ass ) have been used both to estimate the completeness level of each star and to generate synthetic cmds to be compared with the observations .",
    "the method adopted to perform the as - test has been described by anderson et al.(2008 ) .",
    "briefly , we have generated a list of 5@xmath110@xmath5 ass , including their coordinates and magnitudes and placed them along the ms of ngc1755 . for each as in the list the software developed by anderson et al.(2008 ) generates a star in the images with the appropriate flux and position and reduces it by using exactly the same procedure and psf adopted for real stars .",
    "moreover , the software provides for ass the same diagnostics of the photometric and astrometric quality as for real stars .",
    "therefore , we have used in our study of ngc1755 only those ass that are relatively isolated , have small astrometric and photometric errors , and are well fitted by the psf .",
    "completeness has been calculated for each observed star according to its luminosity and radial distance from the cluster center . to do this",
    "we have followed the recipe by milone et al.(2009 ) . in summary , we have defined a grid of @xmath6 points in the magnitude versus radius plane and for each point we have determined the completeness between the number of recovered to added ass . the completeness value associated to each star has been linearly interpolated among these grid points .",

    "a visual inspection of the ngc1755 field reveals that the blue msto is located around @xmath11 while the msto of the red ms is approximately 0.5 mag brighter .",
    "the red and the blue ms seem to merge together below @xmath12 although we can not exclude that a small color difference between the two sequeces , not detectable with the present dataset due to photometric errors , is present at fainter luminosity .",

    "specifically , we have divided the cmd into intervals of 0.2 mag , and for each interval we have calculated the difference between the magnitude and the color of the stars in the input list and the recovered magnitudes and colors . the magnitude and color errors",

    "variations of the photometric zero point along the field of view can either be due to differential reddening and to small inaccuracies in the adopted psf model ( anderson et al.2008 ) .",
    "their main effect on the cmd is a broadening of the sequences , and any photometric study of multiple stellar populations would require an appropriate quantitative assessment of such zero - point variations .    to do this",

    "these results provide strong constraints on the main scenarios suggested to interpret the emsto phenomenon as we will discuss in the following subsections .",
    "the emstos observed in most intermediate - age magellanic cloud star clusters have been interpreted by several groups as due to a extended star formation ( e.g.mackey & broby nielsen 2007 ; baume et al.2007 ; glatt et al.2008 ; milone et al.2009 ; goudfrooij et al.2011 ) .",
    "moreover , milone et al.(2015 ) and correnti et al.(2015 ) have shown that the emsto of the @xmath0300myr - old cluster ngc1856 is consistent with a prolonged period of star formation with a duration of about 150myr .",
    "in contrast , the observed cmd of ngc1755 is not consistent with a difference in age . if we assume , that the same physical process is responsible for both the emsto and the split ms of ngc1755 , ngc1856 , and for the emsto in the intermediate - age magellanic clouds star clusters , our findings rule out the possibility that these cmd features are mostly due to age difference .",
    "goudfrooij et al.(2014 ) have found a correlation between the msto width and the escape velocity of the host cluster and suggested that the emsto would occur in clusters with escape velocities greater than @xmath015 km s@xmath84 , whose velocity escape are higher than the velocity of the stellar winds of first - generation stars out of which the second generations form . moreover goudfrooij and collaborators have hypothesised an early - mass threshold of @xmath85 above which clusters seem to be able to host an emsto .",
    "ngc1755 has a mass of @xmath86 ( popescu et al.2012 ) well below the threshold suggested by goudfrooij et al.(2014 ) .",
    "thus , if the same physical process is responsible for the emsto of young and intermediate - age magellanic clouds star clusters , the fact that the msto of this low - mass cluster is not consistent with a single isochrone would represent a challenge for the scenario by goudfrooij and collaborators .",
    "milone et al.(2015 ) have shown that , among other viable interpretations , the split ms and the emsto of ngc1856 could also be consistent with multiple stellar population with different metallicity . while variations in iron have been observed in several massive galactic gcs ( see marino",
    "et al.2015 and references in their table  10 ) , high - precision photometry of intermediate - age star clusters have shown that the rgb are narrow and well defined and are not consistent with large metallicity variations .",
    "moreover , mucciarelli et al.(2014 ) have inferred the iron abundance of eight stars in the emsto cluster ngc1806 and have concluded that this cluster has homogeneous [ fe / h ] .",
    "the comparison between the observed cmd of ngc1755 and isochrones with different z - values and ages rule out metallicity variation as responsible for the emsto phenomenon .",
    "the cmd of nearly all the old galactic gcs is made of two or more sequences that can be followed along the entire cmd , from the rgb tip , to the hydrogen - burning limit , and correspond to stellar populations with different helium content ( milone et al.2012c ) and light - element abundance ( see gratton et al.2012 for a review on the chemical composition of multiple stellar populations in gcs ) .",
    "the helium variation ranges from @xmath41y@xmath00.15 as in @xmath77centauri and ngc2808 ( e.g.dantona et al.2002 , 2005 ; bedin et al.2004 ; norris2004 ; piotto et al.2007 ) to @xmath41y@xmath00.01 as in ngc6397 and ngc288 ( e.g.milone et al.2012c ; piotto et al.2013 ; see table  2 from milone et al.2014 ) .",
    "in contrast , isochrones with different helium abundance do not reproduce the observed cmd of ngc1755 .",
    "this fact provides a significant difference between the multiple sequences observed in the old galactic gcs and in the young mc clusters .",
    "merged binary systems and interacting binaries have been suggested as possible responsible for the emsto in intermediate - age clusters ( yang et al.2011 ) .",
    "appropriate models , which unfortunately are not available to us , are mandatory to establish to what extend these binary systems are responsible for the emsto and the split ms of ngc1755 .",
    "however , we note that the main challenge for this scenario is that , while the msto of intermediate - age mc clusters is either broadened or bimodal , their ms is narrow and well defined , thus suggesting that binaries would affect only a small mass interval of the cmd .",
    "in addition , binary systems and interactive binaries would produce a spread distribution of the color of stellar sources in the cmd and are not consistent with the split ms observed in ngc1755 and ngc1856 .",
    "multiple stellar populations with different rotation rates can mimic an age spread in intermediate - age star clusters and can be responsible for their emstos as first suggested by bastian & de mink ( 2009 ) .",
    "indeed the stellar structure is significantly affected by stellar rotation and its effective temperature depends on the angle between the star and the observer .",
    "as discussed by yang et al.(2013 ) the parameters adopted in the description of rotational mixing dramatically affect the rotational models so that the emsto of intermediate - age star clusters can be explained or not in terms of rotation depending on the adopted set of models .",
    "as an example the conclusion by bastian & de mink ( 2009 ) is not supported by the results of girardi et al.(2011 ) who have calculated isochrones for intermediate - age mc clusters and concluded that the emsto can not be reproduced by variations in the rotation rate .",
    "more recently , brand & huang(2015 ) and niederhofer et al.(2015 ) have shown that rotating models by georgy et al.(2014 ) can account for the emsto in intermediate - age clusters .",
    "similar conclusion that rotation is respondible for the emsto come from the study by dantona et al.(2015 ) of the @xmath0300-myr old lmc cluster ngc1856 .",
    "this cluster exhibits both an emsto and a split ms with the blue ms hosting about one third of the total number of ms stars .",
    "dantona and collaborators have shown that the cmd of ngc1856 is consistent with two stellar populations .",
    "a group of non - rotating or slow - rotating stars that correspond to the blue ms and the faint msto , plus a population of fast rotating stars with @xmath87 that are associated to the red ms and the bright msto . as in the present case",
    ", the authors warn that the choice of @xmath87 may simply represent a formal solution , linked to the choices of georgy et al.(2014 ) concerning limb and gravity darkening .    in this paper",
    ", we have used models from georgy et al.(2014 ) and find that the observed cmd of ngc1755 is consistent with two stellar populations with different rotation rates .",
    "a stellar population hosting about one - forth of the total number of stars with no rotation plus a population of fast rotating stars with @xmath80 . while the cmd of ngc1856 was also consistent with age or metallicity variations ( milone et al.2015 ; correnti et al.2015 ) , the observations of the young ngc1755 rule out age and metallicity variations as responsible for the emsto and the split ms .",
    "unfortunately , rotating models for stars with @xmath79 are not available to us , and our conclusions are based on the comparison between the models and the cmd region with @xmath88 .    noticeably , the interpretation of the emsto phenomenon in mc clusters is due to stellar populations with different rotation is still controversial .",
    "first of all , multiple mss have been detected only in three clusters younger than @xmath0300 myr , namely ngc1844 , ngc1755 and ngc1856 and the emsto has been observed only in the latter two clusters .",
    "appropriate observations of a large sample of young clusters are needed to establish to what extent the multiple mss and emsto are common features of these objects .",
    "moreover , there are significant difference in the interpretation of the emsto in intermediate - age and young clusters . as an example , the conclusion by niederhofer et al.(2015 ) that the emsto of intermediate - age clusters can be explained in terms of stellar rotation , are valid as long as the initial rotation distribution covers the interval from @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "in contrast , the split ms of ngc1755 and ngc1856 are consistent with two distinct populations with extreme values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we also emphasize that the rotational models adopted in this paper provide a poor fit of the emsto of ngc1755 although this issue could by due to second - order parameters that affect the hydrogen burning phase . as an example , the stellar luminosity and effective temperature are significantly affected by the way the in which the inclination angle has been taken into account ( see dantona et al.2015 for details ) .",
    "as previously noticed by dantona et al.(2015 ) for ngc1856 , the origin of the non - rotating or slow - rotating stellar populations is another open issue and a possible solution could come from studies on b- and a - type stars in the field .",
    "since most of the field b- and a - type stars are rapid rotators , the main challenge would concern the physical process responsible for slowing down about one forth of stars in ngc1755 . a bimodal velocity distribution , with a slow - velocity component , has been observed by zorec & royer ( 2012 ) among ms field stars with @xmath93 and by dufton et al.(2013 ) among early b - type stars .",
    "this analysis was mostly appropriate for ngc1856 stars , with turnoff masses of @xmath94 .",
    "here we are dealing also with masses considerably larger , up to 5 @xmath95 or more , for which the observational data are scarce .",
    "it is well possible that we are witnessing the same kind of process .",
    "zorec & royer ( 2012 ) have suggested that the observed slow - rotating and non - rotating stars would have lost their angular momentum during the pre - ms phase due to magnetic breaking .",
    "as an alternative , tidal interaction in binary systems could be responsible for the slow down of a fraction of stars .",
    "the latter hypothesis is supported by the study of b- and a - type stars by abt & boonyarak ( 2004 ) .",
    "these authors have found that , due to tidal interaction , the rotational velocities in binaries with period between 4 and 500 days is significantly smaller than for single stars .",
    "et al.(2015 ) have thus suggested that binary synchronisation could be responsible for the slow - rotating population of ngc1856 and we can extend this view to the case of ngc1755 .    in this context , we note that the fraction of non - rotating stars in the @xmath0300 myr old cluster ngc1856 is the 33@xmath425% of the total number of ms stars ( milone et al.2015 ) and is slightly higher than that observed in the younger cluster ngc1755 .",
    "these values are similar to the fraction of stars in the faint msto of the intermediate - age clusters ngc1806 ( 26@xmath424% ) , ngc1846 ( 25@xmath423% ) , and ngc1751 ( 31@xmath424% , milone et al.2009 ) and suggest that , whatever the mechanism for slowing down rotation , it must be a fast process , so that there is no correlation between the cluster age and the fraction of non - rotating stars .",
    "otherwhise , we must assume that a fraction of @xmath025 - 30% of cluster stars are born slowly rotating .",
