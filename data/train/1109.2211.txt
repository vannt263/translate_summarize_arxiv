    "the problem of antiferromagnetism on a triangular lattice occupies a special place in the history of frustrated magnetism . the failure of the ising antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice to order at _ any _ temperature has been widely celebrated since the pioneering work of wannier  @xcite and husimi and syoji  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the hugely influential idea of a zero - temperature quantum spin - liquid was first mooted by anderson in the context of the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice  @xcite .",
    "more recent calculations suggest that this model _ does _ order at @xmath1 , albeit with a much - reduced sublattice magnetisation , in a coplanar three - sublattice `` 120-degree '' state  @xcite .",
    "however , even at a classical level , the finite - temperature physics of this ordered phase is far from simple .",
    "the 120-degree state possesses a ( pseudo)-vector chirality defined by the handedness of the spin texture in each elementary triangle  @xcite . as a consequence , the model can support @xmath2 vortices as well as conventional spin - wave excitations , and",
    "its low - temperature phase has been argued to be a `` spin gel '' in which both play an important role  @xcite . despite a very determined effort in simulation ,",
    "these ideas remain controversial  @xcite .",
    "frustrated magnets also exhibit a fantastically rich range of phases in applied magnetic field , and once again , studies of the triangular lattice antiferromagnet have played a central role in forming opinion .",
    "the ising antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice famously exhibits a one - third magnetisation plateau in applied magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "a one - third magnetisation plateau is also found in the heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice , where it takes the form of a collinear three - sublattice state stabilised by both thermal  @xcite and quantum  @xcite fluctuations .",
    "fluctuations select two further phases as a function of magnetic field  a coplanar , three - sublattice `` y  state '' , which is a canted version of the 120-degree state , and a 2:1 canted phase , which is a coplanar , canted version of the one - third magnetisation plateau  @xcite .",
    "the same succession of phases also occurs in the xy antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice  @xcite , and very similar magnetic phase diagrams occur in a wide range of other models .",
    "consequently , the magnetisation process of the triangular - lattice antiferromagnet is often presented as the paradigm for the behaviour of a frustrated magnet under field . as",
    "such it serves as a useful starting point to discuss e.g. , the classical kagom  @xcite , and shastry - sutherland  @xcite antiferromagnets .",
    "further motivation for studying triangular lattice antiferromagnets in field can be taken directly from experiment .",
    "a full magnetic phase diagram as a function of field and temperature has been measured for a range of triangular lattice antiferromagnets  @xcite , which include the @xmath3=@xmath4 intermetallic gdpd@xmath5al@xmath6  @xcite , and the @xmath3=@xmath7 insulating oxides rbfe(moo@xmath8)@xmath5  @xcite and rb@xmath8mn(moo@xmath8)@xmath6  @xcite . in all of these cases",
    "magnetic anisotropy  @xcite and/or weak interlayer coupling  @xcite must be taken into account .",
    "none the less , clear evidence is found in each case for the three phases found in a heisenberg model  the y - state , the one - third magnetisation plateau , and the 2:1 canted phase .",
    "more general models , with competing or anisotropic exchange interactions , exhibit even more complex behaviour as a function of field and temperature .",
    "these remain a subject of intensive study for the examples they provide of novel magnetic phases  @xcite , and for their delicate and subtle finite - temperature phase transitions  @xcite .    in the context of all this activity",
    ", it is perhaps surprising that there are only two published attempts to determine the phase diagram of classical heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice in applied magnetic field from monte carlo simulation  @xcite . and , while these authors agree as to the phases present , the nature of the phase transitions between them remains largely unexplored . in this paper",
    "we attempt to remedy this situation by using modern monte carlo simulation techniques to study the phase transitions which occur in the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a triangular lattice , as a function of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the challenge  and interest  of this problem stems from the fact that the coplanar y - state and 2:1 canted phases break both discrete symmetries of the lattice _ and _ spin - rotation symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the applied field .",
    "moreover , since the mermin - wagner theorem forbids the breaking of a continuous symmetry in two dimensions  @xcite , spin - rotation symmetry is broken only at the level of a topological , berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this type of compound symmetry - breaking is notoriously difficult to disentangle in two dimensions .",
    "the example of coupled ising [ @xmath9 and xy [ @xmath10 fields , in particular , has a long history , dating back to work on spin glasses by villain  @xcite .",
    "questions of @xmath11 symmetry breaking also arise in the xy antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice  @xcite , and in models of coupled josephson - junction arrays  @xcite .",
    "a central theme for each of these problems is when  if ever  ising and xy symmetries are broken in a single , continuous , phase transition  @xcite .        in the case of the coplanar phases found in the triangular - lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet in applied magnetic field ,",
    "the relevant symmetry is @xmath12 , and we find that the compound nature of the order parameters significantly modifies the phase transitions which separate coplanar phases from the high - temperature paramagnet . for low values of field , we find a double phase transition , with the system passing first from the paramagnet into the collinear one - third magnetisation plateau , and then into the y - state .",
    "these transitions belong to the three - state potts and bkt universality classes , respectively .",
    "another bkt phase transition is found at roughly constant field , separating the one - third magnetisation plateau and the 2:1 canted state .",
    "approaching saturation , a _",
    "single _ continuous phase transition is found from the paramagnet into the 2:1  canted state .",
    "this exhibits a non - universal jump in spin - stiffness and continuously varying exponents as a function of magnetic field , and so does not belong to _ any _ conventional universality class .",
    "in reaching these conclusions , we pay careful attention to finite - size effects , which are found to be very large for low values of magnetic field .",
    "our results are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows  : in section  [ section : methods ] we briefly discuss the monte carlo method used and introduce the order parameters for the different phases , together with associated correlation functions , and finite - size ansazes . in section  [ section : overview ]",
    "we discuss the topology of the overall magnetic phase diagram , focusing on the importance of finite - size scaling . in section  [ section : field - sweep ]",
    "we discuss the transitions between ordered phases at low temperature . in section",
    "[ section : low - middle - field ] we present representative cases of double phase transitions upon cooling , characteristic of low and intermediate fields . in section",
    "[ section : high - field ] we discuss a representative case of the single phase transition observed at high field and its properties .",
    "lastly , we conclude with an overall summary of our results and a discussion of some of the remaining open questions in section  [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "the model we consider is defined by the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath13 where the sum @xmath14 runs over all nearest - neighbour bonds of a triangular lattice ( assuming periodic boundary conditions ) and the sum on @xmath15 runs over @xmath16 lattice sites .",
    "we consider antiferromagnetic exchange interactions @xmath17 , and spins are taken to be classical vectors of unit length . in the presence of magnetic field",
    "it is convenient to rewrite this hamiltonian as @xmath18,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum on @xmath19 runs over all triangular plaquettes in the lattice and @xmath20 by inspection , for @xmath21 the system takes on its minimum energy for @xmath22 at zero temperature , this condition selects a manifold of three - sublattice states which evolves smoothly from the 120-degree state at @xmath23 to saturation at @xmath24 . in what follows we set @xmath25 , and measure @xmath26 in units of @xmath27 .",
    "the degeneracy of this manifold is lifted by thermal fluctuations , which select collinear and coplanar states over the non - coplanar ones at low temperature , in a manifestation of the celebrated `` order - from - disorder '' effect  @xcite .",
    "the resulting phases are    a.   a coplanar y - state with one spin pinned in the negative @xmath28 direction and two canting `` up '' , i.e. a distorted version of the 120-degree state ; b.   a collinear state at exactly @xmath29 , with two spins `` up '' and one spin `` down '' , i.e. a one - third magnetisation plateau ; c.   a coplanar 2:1 canted version of the plateau , which smoothly interpolates until the collinear saturated paramagnet is reached at @xmath30 .    these phases are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] .    in the collinear one - third magnetisation plateau ( ii ) ,",
    "only the @xmath28 components of spin participate in symmetry breaking . in the presence of magnetic field ,",
    "this phase breaks only a discrete @xmath31 symmetry of the lattice , and long - range order is permitted in 2d .",
    "however , the coplanar y - state ( i ) and 2:1 canted phase ( iii ) also involve spin components in the @xmath32-@xmath33 plane . in this case",
    ", long - range order implies selecting a common plane for canting , breaking the @xmath34 symmetry for rotation of spins about the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "since the mermin - wagner theorem forbids the breaking of this continuous symmetry at any finite temperature in 2d , only a regime with `` quasi - long - range '' order , described by the algebraic decay of spin correlations , is permitted .",
    "both coplanar phases also inherit the broken lattice symmetry , hence a compound @xmath35 symmetry is broken at @xmath1 .",
    "these phases with broken mixed symmetries can also be viewed as magnetic `` supersolids ''  @xcite .    in order to study the finite - temperature properties of the model defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) we perform large - scale parallel tempering  @xcite monte carlo simulations . simulating this model is challenging because of the under - constrained nature of the @xmath1 ground state .",
    "at low temperature the system can become frozen in non - coplanar @xmath1 ground states which still obey the magnetisation constraint , especially for small system sizes . in this case , the thermal - selection process is not fully realised and strong finite - size effects are visible . in order to overcome this problem",
    ", we couple the parallel - tempering monte carlo scheme to successive deterministic over - relaxation sweeps , which comprise the reflection of each spin around its respective local field .",
    "since this is a reversible and micro - canonical update , the global markov chain for parallel tempering and over - relaxation also obeys detailed balance on the whole .",
    "simulations of from 48 to 128 replicas ( temperatures ) were performed in parallel for a variety of rhombohedral clusters with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the linear size @xmath36 was chosen to be commensurate with three - sublattice order in the range @xmath37 .",
    "typical simulations involved 2@xmath3810@xmath39 steps , half of which were discarded for thermalisation .",
    "each step consisted of one local - update sweep of the lattice followed by two over - relaxation sweeps , with replicas at different temperatures exchanged every 10 steps .",
    "random initial configurations were employed .",
    "the three ordered phases found break the translational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "this can also be interpreted as the breaking of permutation symmetry between the three different sublattices in which the triangular lattice can be divided , labelled _ a _ , _ b _ and _ c_. in order to study this process , we introduce a complex order parameter , based on a two - dimensional irreducible representation of the @xmath31 lattice rotation group latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath59@xmath60@xmath61@xmath62@xmath63 and @xmath56 has been normalised by @xmath64 to the unit area . since parallel tempering effectively restores the lattice symmetries , @xmath56 is averaged over three symmetric directions in the lattice } .",
    "the unbinding of vortex pairs at a bkt phase transition suppresses the spin stiffness , leading to a jump in @xmath56 at the transition temperature @xmath65 .",
    "this jump @xmath66 can be expressed in terms of the correlation - length exponent @xmath55 as  @xcite @xmath67 in a conventional bkt transition , @xmath68 , and the jump in spin stiffness takes on the universal value @xmath69 .",
    "however , @xmath65 is itself strongly renormalised in finite - size simulations , and the correct ansatz for the finite - size scaling of @xmath65 must take account of logarithmic corrections  @xcite @xmath70 fits of this two - parameter scaling form to finite - size results for the jump in spin stiffness give an estimate of the true @xmath65 in the thermodynamic limit",
    ".    the perpendicular component of the @xmath71 order parameter , @xmath72 , can be defined by analogy with eqs.([eq : o - c3 - 1])-([eq : c3-aft ] ) . since",
    "this quantity implies a ( staggered ) planar magnetisation it must vanish at any finite temperature in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , in a bkt phase transition , the scaling of the perpendicular structure factor @xmath73 , analogue to eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - z3 ] ) , yields the characteristic critical exponent @xmath74 .",
    "empirically , we find that the analysis of the correlation length @xmath75 provides the most precise method to obtain the transition temperature for this model , being less sensitive to finite - size effects than , e.g. , binder cumulants  @xcite . in order to calculate this quantity , the structure factor function associated with momentum @xmath76",
    "is first defined as @xmath77 around the wave vectors corresponding to incipient three - sublattice order   and in a disordered phase , this quantity displays the characteristic lorentzian form @xmath78 , arising from short - range correlations . for a sufficiently large system",
    "the correlation length @xmath75 can be obtained from the ratio between @xmath79 at @xmath80 and the nearest allowed wave vector @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "( [ eq : corr - len ] ) is only directly related to the physical correlation length in the absence of long - range order , that is to say , of bragg peaks in the structure factor .",
    "the structure - factor function , and thereby the correlation length , can be divided into parallel ( @xmath84 ) , and perpendicular ( @xmath85 ) components , where the @xmath28 axis is defined by the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the correlation length becomes infinite at any critical point , whether this is a conventional continuous phase transition , or the topological transition into a critical bkt phase .",
    "hence the scaled quantities @xmath86 or @xmath87 become independent of system size ( or field ) at this temperature , from where @xmath54 ( or @xmath88 ) can be found in an unbiased way .",
    "error bars for @xmath54 are estimated using the difference between @xmath54 as obtained by the intersection of the scaled @xmath75 between the two largest clusters available and as obtained the intersection between the second- and third - largest clusters available .",
    "the data collapse of @xmath75 for different system sizes can also be used to extract the correlation - length exponent @xmath50 at a continuous phase transition @xmath89",
    "our main results are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "it is not our objective to address the properties of the peculiar @xmath90 phase transition at @xmath23 , although it has been speculated that this survives the presence of a ( very ) small external field  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , accurate simulations become increasingly difficult for very low fields and , owing to the very large correlation length in the  spin plane , require system sizes larger than the ones presently available .",
    "we will therefore not discuss the phase diagram for @xmath91 , an area left unshaded in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] .    for @xmath92",
    ", two different phase transitions occur as a function of temperature . at high temperature",
    "a continuous phase transition signals the breaking of the translational symmetry of the lattice along the @xmath28 spin direction .",
    "the resulting phase is the collinear one - third magnetization plateau .",
    "we note in passing that the magnetization of this plateau is not tied to one third in a classical heisenberg model at finite temperature , since the collinear `` up - up - down '' state is dressed with thermally excited spin - wave excitations .",
    "( a perfectly collinear `` up - up - down '' state is realised in a classical model only at @xmath1 and @xmath29 , where it is energetically degenerate with many other , non - coplanar , states ) .    in the field range @xmath93 ,",
    "the canted y - state is found by lowering the temperature from the one - third magnetization plateau .",
    "the y - state inherits the broken translational symmetry of the plateau and , since two of its spins are canted , also breaks spin - rotational symmetry at @xmath1 . at finite temperature , this results in a phase with algebraic order in the @xmath32-@xmath33 plane .",
    "the best interpretation of our numerical results is that , in the thermodynamic limit , the y - state is never found to be in contact with the paramagnet , in agreement with other recent works  @xcite .    for values of field above the plateau and below the saturation limit , @xmath94 , a single",
    "_ continuous _ phase transition separates the paramagnet from the 2:1 canted state .",
    "this transition corresponds to the _ simultaneous _ onset of long - range order in the @xmath28 spin component and algebraic order in the @xmath32-@xmath33 spin plane .",
    "the transition temperature associated with long - range order along the @xmath28 direction is obtained by the critical scaling of the corresponding correlation length @xmath84 .",
    "the transition temperature between the plateau and the y - state is obtained by the characteristic bkt finite - size scaling of the jump in the spin stiffness .",
    "although the critical scaling of the @xmath85 correlation length should yield the same result , we find that this method is less accurate , even for intermediate fields .",
    "this can be explained by the very rapid growth of the @xmath87 ratio as field is lowered , until eventually this correlation length exceeds the linear sizes of the available clusters , rendering this analysis useless .",
    "hence , as we shall see , the determination of @xmath65 using @xmath85 is less accurate than that using @xmath56 for the same set of system sizes , even at intermediate fields .",
    "the onset of algebraic order in the @xmath32-@xmath33 plane associated with the 2:1 canted state is obtained through the onset of critical scaling in @xmath85 , both as a fixed - temperature scan from the plateau or as a fixed - field scan from the paramagnetic region .",
    "the transition temperatures obtained with the perpendicular @xmath85 and parallel @xmath84 correlation lengths agree very well , although they relate to different symmetries .",
    "moreover , a jump in the spin stiffness is observed very close to the transition temperature found with the analysis of the correlation lengths .",
    "these conclusions are valid in the thermodynamic limit @xmath95 .",
    "it is instructive to contrast them with the results obtained for a finite - size cluster with @xmath96 , summarised in the pseudo phase - diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram - l120 ] . in order to determine the finite - size `` transition '' points we analyse the crossing of the correlation lengths between a single pair of system sizes , @xmath97 and @xmath96 , and",
    "register the temperature where @xmath98 for @xmath96 . at low field , the transitions between the paramagnet and the plateau , and between the plateau and y - state , are now indistinguishable , within error bars .",
    "hence the best interpretation is that a single phase transition separates the y - state from the one - third magnetization plateau . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram - l120 ] the position of the plateau - y - state transition , obtained with the critical scaling of @xmath85 , is also shown .",
    "the difference between the transition temperature thus obtained and the one obtained using @xmath56 vanishes gradually as field is increased . together with the observation that the @xmath85 correlation length increases with decreasing field , eventually becoming larger than @xmath96 for @xmath99",
    ", we can understand that the determination of @xmath65 from @xmath85 is very strongly affected by finite - size corrections .",
    "therefore , we only plot the result obtained with @xmath56 in the @xmath95 phase diagram , cf .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] .",
    "when passing from the paramagnet to the 2:1 canted state at higher fields , a similar separation is observed between the transition temperature obtained using the scaling of correlation lengths , and that obtained from the jump in spin stiffness . however , once again we observe that this difference vanishes when the correct finite - size scaling is performed .",
    "we return to this point below .",
    "we start our analysis of the phase transitions with a scan in field at fixed temperature , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : t005 ] , which can also be found as a vertical dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] .",
    "all the ordered phases discussed are found as the value of field is increased : firstly we have the low - field y - state , which is then followed by the one - third plateau at @xmath100 , and finally the 2:1 canted state at @xmath101 . leaving the plateau by either lowering or increasing magnetic field corresponds to the onset of algebraic order in the @xmath32-@xmath33 plane , as observed in the rise of the corresponding correlation length @xmath85 and spin stiffness , cf .",
    "[ fig : t005](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "these simulation runs were performed without parallel tempering , but the over - relaxation procedure alone was enough to obtain good results .",
    "the transitions in this region are found to be rather easy to simulate , since correlation lengths are relatively small .",
    "the different nature of the magnetisation plateau , when compared to the surrounding canted phases , is clear in the suppression of magnetic susceptibility @xmath102 , cf .",
    "[ fig : t005](c ) .",
    "this feature becomes more pronounced as the temperature at which the field scan is performed is lowered .",
    "both phase boundaries between the plateau and canted phase are approximately linear in temperature , and can be traced to different spin - wave excitations of the plateau state .",
    "the transition between the plateau and the 2:1 canted state is only weakly dependent on temperature , indicating that both phases have roughly the same entropy , arising from similar spin - wave excitations .",
    "the other spin - wave excitation inside the plateau corresponds to a canting of the `` up '' spins .",
    "since this lowers the total magnetisation along @xmath28 , this spin - wave is favoured energetically if field is decreased , making it more favourable to create a spin - wave than to `` ca nt '' all spins into the y - state .",
    "this `` protects '' the plateau against the decrease of field , and it is this higher entropy of the collinear phase  @xcite which makes the plateau - y - state transition line slope downwards .",
    "for values of applied field in the range @xmath93 a double phase transition is found as temperature is lowered from the paramagnetic region . in fig .",
    "[ fig : h=04 ] we present results for @xmath104 , which is representative of the low - field region @xmath105 .",

    "this is indicative of , respectively , long - range order in the direction parallel to field and quasi - long - range ( algebraic ) order in the perpendicular plane , as expected in the y - state .",
    "however , the absolute value of these quantities at finite temperature is _ strongly _ dependent of the system size .",
    "this can be attributed to the proximity of the @xmath23 point , where both these order parameters vanish and the correlation length is very large ( but probably finite )  @xcite .",
    "this explains the unusually strong finite - size corrections , which vanish gradually as field is increased .",
    "in fact , the most spectacular demonstration of these problems lies in the absence of critical scaling of the @xmath85 correlation length , i.e. there is no common crossing or collapse for different system sizes , cf . fig .",
