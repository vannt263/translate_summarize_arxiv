    "in a previous work , it has been shown how to find an mps approximation to the ground state of a long - range hamiltonian using an extension of the time - dependent variational principle ( tdvp ) @xcite .",
    "the tdvp is an algorithm that uses the geometric notion of the mps tangent plane @xcite .",
    "it allows to find the ground - state description as a mps by solving a differential equation for the tensors defining the mps .",
    "the same generalization of the tdvp presented in @xcite can be used to perform real - time evolutions @xcite for systems with long - range interaction , which we have exploited to compute the quench dynamics described in the main text .",
    "the main difference when performing the dynamics  instead of imaginary time",
    "as is necessary to obtain the ground state  in real time , is that special care has to be taken to ensure that the algorithm does not violate time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this immediately ensures that the algorithm conserves both the norm and the energy of the initial state , as it should .",
    "care is advised , as real - time evolution does not enjoy the same self - correction as imaginary - time evolutions where small errors in one step can be corrected in the next step . here , instead",
    ", any small error is propagated along the simulation , and one needs further care to minimize those .    here",
    ", we describe the steps we follow in order to ensure the time - reversal invariance of the integrators scheme that we apply to the above - mentioned differential equations .",
    "this is a simple modification of the technique proposed in @xcite , suitable for evolutions dictated by long - range hamiltonians in finite chains .",
    "first , we briefly recall the general strategy that is common to both real - time and imaginary - time dynamics .    _",
    "( 1 ) _ encode the starting state of the time evolution as a mps described by the set of tensors @xmath9 @xmath94 , @xmath95 @xmath96 and _ ( 2 ) _ encode the long - range hamiltonian as a mpo described by a set of tensors @xmath9 @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "the evolved state is obtained by _ ( 3 ) _ solving the schrdinger equation for a short time interval @xmath99 with initial condition given by @xmath31 , @xmath100 where we set @xmath101 . _ ( 4 ) _ to solve the above equation inside the manifold of mps with fixed tensor dimensions , one needs to introduce tangent vectors .",
    "these are generically defined through two sets of tensors @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and are expressed as the linear combination of mps defined by @xmath7 everywhere but one @xmath104 at a specific place , in formula @xmath105 where we have used the notation @xmath106 to define the set of @xmath7 tensors from which we have removed tensor @xmath107 .    _",
    "( 5 ) _ while the left hand side of the above equation defines a tangent space to the manifold of the mps with fixed bond dimension , the right hand side is not contained in that space and should be explicitly projected onto it . in formula",
    ", we would like to find the tangent vector @xmath108 that minimizes the distance from @xmath109 , @xmath110    in practice , in the canonical form , the computation is simplified by requiring that the tangent vectors are orthogonal to the original vector . to ensure the orthogonality , the @xmath104 tensors in the tangent vectors",
    "are defined as the contraction of auxiliary tensors , ( for normalization convenience ) the inverse square root of the reduced density matrix , times a matrix of free coefficients of dimension called @xmath111 , and a fixed projector @xmath112 on the orthogonal space to the one on which the starting vector is defined .    _",
    "( 6 ) _ at this point , one can discretize eq .   and integrate it iteratively through @xmath113 for all sites @xmath114 .",
    "we now turn to real - time dynamics , and we focus specifically on designing a time - reversal - invariant integrator scheme .",
    "this requires improving the first - order integrator to at least the so called middle - point integrator .",
    "this involves finding an intermediate step for each @xmath37 , @xmath115 such that both @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the set of tensors defining the projection onto the tangent space of the action of the hamiltonian on the state @xmath119 .",
    "the two above conditions can be taken as a definition of @xmath120 that we then use to complete the evolution step by just integrating the state for another @xmath121 , @xmath122 so that we ensure that the evolution is invariant under time reversal .",
    "the important part becomes finding the intermediate @xmath120 . as suggested in @xcite",
    ", one can devise an iterative procedure to determine @xmath120 . here , we describe an alternative procedure to the one presented in @xcite that is well suited for finite - chain hamiltonians encoded in mpo as the ones discussed in this paper .",
    "the procedure consists in proceeding locally in the evolution ( site by site ) requiring that each local step is time - reversal invariant . for this reason , chosen a position @xmath37 in the chain , one proceeds by    _ ( 1 ) _ obtaining a trial @xmath123 by solving eq .   for a time step @xmath124 , with the initial state locally described by @xmath125 . _ ( 2 ) _ obtaining a trial @xmath126 by finding the best tangent vector that approximates the r.h.s .  of eq .",

    "( 6 ) _ in this way , we can obtain the improved estimate of the middle point @xmath133 as @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the projection on the tangent plane at the old estimate @xmath123 .",
    "we then repeat the procedure starting again from step _ ( 2 ) _ and iterate as often as necessary in order to bring the error in the inversion @xmath136 below the required precision ( typically around @xmath137 ) .",
    "the procedure is repeated for all sites , and at the end of a sweep from 1 to @xmath9 , one completes an elementary evolution step of @xmath138 . for more details about the other aspects of the algorithm and possible improvement using higher - order ruge ",
    "kutta integration schemes , we refer the reader to the literature on the subject @xcite .",
    "to gain some analytical understanding of the dynamics of the long - range system described by hamiltonian , we employ a linear spin - wave theory ( lswt ) .",
    "this theory is well known to yield good qualitative results in phases with strong magnetic order @xcite , such as the strongly @xmath20-polarized phase occurring for small @xmath17 @xcite . in our numerical analysis , we will therefore focus on that case , although we will keep our derivations general .",
    "an advantage of lswt is that the long - range interactions are implemented into the formalism without additional complications , as we will sketch now .      as a first step to finding the ground state of spin waves , it is convenient to rotate the spins into a local , twisted coordinate system @xmath139 , so that the new @xmath140 axis is aligned with the quantization axis . in the antiferromagnetic case of @xmath141 ,",

    "we now insert these into hamiltonian  , neglect contributions beyond linear order in @xmath155 , and use that terms that are linear in the boson operators vanish in the minimum of the free energy .",

    "<S> [ fig : dispersionrelations_analytical]b , the transition between the three regimes can be clearly identified .    </S>",

    "<S> the fact that the excess of ee of a block saturates to a value independent of its size is in remarkable contrast to the ground - state properties . </S>",
    "<S> this effect finds a natural explanation in the semi - classical picture of pseudo - particles : the states that dominate the time evolution are states with only one pseudo - particle ; the @xmath83 is then immediately understood as coming from the two orthogonal possibilities of the pseudo - particle being either in the left or in the right half - chain .    </S>",
    "<S> a further confirmation comes from the half - chain entanglement - spectrum evolution , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the @xmath37-th eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix of half of the chain . </S>",

    "<S> a clear signature is , e.g. , the speed with which excitations reach the boundary and its scaling with system size . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the ratio of the wave - front maximum and the subsequent minimum distinguishes the short - range and the weakly long - range regime . in the former , </S>",

    "<S> the time scale of the spin interactions is typically @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , although the group velocities of the spin system can not truly diverge , they can be several times larger than the scale set by @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> this still provides a drastic effect that can be explored in typical practical implementations @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions _ via quasi - exact numerics based on tensor networks and analytical calculations of the spin - wave dispersion , we have identified three qualitatively different regimes of the non - equilibrium dynamics in the lrti model , indicating different degrees of the break - down of locality . </S>",
    "<S> the quasi - particle dispersion undergoes drastic changes at @xmath93 and @xmath49 , marking a transition from short - range over weakly long - range to strong long - range physics . in the last case , </S>",
    "<S> diverging quasi - particle velocities lead to a practically instantaneous spread of excitations through the entire system </S>",
    "<S> . it will be interesting to study how these findings carry over to larger dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have outlined how to identify the different degrees of non - locality in typical trapped - ion experiments , and we hope our findings to inspire experiments along these lines .    identifying violations of the lieb  </S>",
    "<S> robinson bounds  besides establishing the presence / absence of causality in systems with long - range interactions  may pave the way for extending well - established results about the complexity of ground states @xcite , and the relation between the decay of correlations and the scaling of entanglement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the lieb  robinson bound has important implications for thermalization @xcite : if the system locally equilibrates to a generalized gibbs ensemble , time - dependent correlation functions are described by the same ensemble @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are key issues that have strong technical consequences for our ability to simulate the quantum system on a computer . </S>",
