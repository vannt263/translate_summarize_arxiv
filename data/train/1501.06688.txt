    "after the fabrication of graphene , the kondo effect in graphene has attracted much theoretical attention , because exotic kondo effects and associated phenomena due to its dirac conduction electrons are expected , such as multichannel kondo effects , gate - tunable kondo effects , and an impurity quantum phase transition between an unscreened and a screened localized moment state [ 1 - 6].as candidates of the realization of the kondo effect in graphene , the graphene with magnetic impurities such as fe or co has been investigated by dft calculations  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the kondo effect in these systems has been argued by examining the lattice positions , the spin state of the impurity atom , and the strength and symmetry of the hybridization between the impurity and the conduction electrons .",
    "experiments on graphene with such magnetic impurities have been attempted , and spectral signatures of the kondo screening have been observed in scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) experiments  @xcite . in such systems , however , kondo effect had not been observed in resistivity measurements .    in 2011 ,",
    "the kondo effect was reported in the resistivity of graphene with defects  @xcite .",
    "the defects were introduced by the irradiation of he@xmath1 ions with the energy of 500 ev .",
    "the temperature dependence of resistivity showed logarithmic increase with decreasing temperature and saturating behavior at low temperatures .",
    "the temperature dependence can be fitted well by the universal temperature dependence of the kondo effect . in the ion - irradiated graphene ,",
    "the negative magnetoresistance was also observed  @xcite .",
    "magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the graphene plane .",
    "the contribution of the weak localization is suppressed by the magnetic field @xmath2 t , and a magnetoresistance due to another mechanism occurs at higher magnetic fields . in the case of the kondo effect , the zeeman effect of magnetic field can cause such a negative magnetoresistance . from these observations ,",
    "the kondo effect due to magnetic origin was concluded in this system .",
    "to clarify the origin of the kondo effect , many theoretical studies have been performed [ 9 - 15].on the other hand , it also has been proposed that the electron - electron interaction in the presence of the disorder is responsible for the logarithmic increase of the resistivity at low temperatures  @xcite . although there is the other possible theory , in this paper , we focus on the defect induced kondo effect .    until the discovery of the defect induced kondo effect ,",
    "the defects in graphene or graphite have been studied as a source of magnetism  @xcite . in graphite , it has been observed that magnetic moments are induced by irradiation of high - energy ( 2.25 mev ) protons  @xcite . in the graphene irradiated with ions , the magnetic moments",
    "have also been observed  @xcite .",
    "it has been indicated that the defect individually behaves as a localized magnetic moment .",
    "such defects have been studied in stm experiments  @xcite .",
    "these experiments show that the introduced defects are point defects ( or point vacancies ) .",
    "the defects in graphene have also been investigated with transmission electron microscopes ( tems )  @xcite , and reconstruction and deformation of the defect are observed .",
    "such a point defect in graphene has been studied with the dft calculations .",
    "first , the lattice structure was investigated  @xcite .",
    "two possible structures were considered : one is a threefold symmetric structure that preserves the original symmetry , and the other is a twofold symmetric structure in which one of the c - c distances is shortened .",
    "it was clarified that the latter is more stable owning to the jahn - teller effect , and it has an out - of - plane displacement , while the former has a planar structure .",
    "second , the spin state was investigated by using spin - polarized dft calculations  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the defect is magnetic and the dangling @xmath3 bond which appears at the defect is responsible for the magnetic moment .    in graphene , effects of defect scattering on the @xmath0 electrons have been studied theoretically , and it has been suggested that the point defect induces a localized state of @xmath0 electrons around the defect whose energy eigenvalue coincides with the energy of the dirac points [ 26 - 29].such a localized @xmath0 orbital has been observed experimentally with the stm . in scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) experiments ,",
    "the localized @xmath0 orbital exhibits a sharp peak in local density of states ( ldos ) near the defect .",
    "although the origin of the kondo effect in graphene with defects seems to be due to the localized magnetic moments on the @xmath3 orbital at the defects , the role of localized @xmath0 orbital has not been understood in detail .",
    "recently , although a model where the localized state of @xmath0 electrons is rather artificially added at the defect  @xcite has been proposed , more consideration on the derivation of the model and the analysis are necessary .",
    "in addition , in this defect induced kondo effect , the anomalous negative magnetoresistance has been observed : in the usual kondo effect , the energy scale of a characteristic magnetic field of the negative magnetoresistance is the same order as that of the kondo temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "experimentally , the characteristic magnetic field seems to be one tenth smaller than the value expected from the kondo temperature , which means that this kondo effect is sensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "however , this mechanism has not been understood yet .",
    "thus , in this paper , we discuss the role of localized @xmath0 orbital on the defect - induced kondo effect in graphene on the basis of a numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) study  @xcite . as a result",
    ", we find that the localized @xmath0 orbital assists the kondo effect , and the kondo temperature is sensitive to the broadening of the localized @xmath0 orbital . next , in order to clarify the mechanism of the magnetic sensitive kondo effect , as a first step , we study an orbital magnetic field dependence of the localized @xmath0 orbital by a tight - binding model with a peierls phase .",
    "we show that the ldos on the localized @xmath0 orbital decreases as the magnetic field increases .    in  .2",
    ", we develop an effective model with the localized @xmath0 orbital and transforms the effective model into a one - dimensional representation of the conduction electron states to apply nrg method . in  .3",
    ", we discuss the effect of the localized @xmath0 orbital by nrg study .",
    "finally , in  .4 , we discuss an orbital magnetic field dependence of the localized state of @xmath0 electrons by the tight binding model with the peierls phase .",

    "<S> we discuss a role of the localized @xmath0 orbital , which exists around the defect , on the defect - induced kondo effect in graphene by a numerical renormalization group study . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the localized @xmath0 orbital assists this kondo effect , and the kondo temperature is sensitive to the broadening of the localized @xmath0 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we focus on the negative magnetoresistance of this kondo effect . in the experimental result </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown that the negative magnetoresistance is ten times larger than the usual kondo effect . in order to clarify the mechanism of the `` magnetic sensitive '' kondo effect , as a first step , we study an orbital magnetic field dependence of the localized @xmath0 orbital by a tight - binding model with a peierls phase . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as the magnetic field increases , the spectral width of the localized @xmath0 orbital increases and the local dos at the fermi level decreases . </S>",
    "<S> since the kondo temperature is strongly dependent of the broadening of the localized @xmath0 orbital , it is expected that this kondo effect is sensitive to the orbital magnetic field as observed in the experiment . </S>"
