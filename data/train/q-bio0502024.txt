    "cytoskeletal motors such as kinesin , dynein , and myosin are proteins which convert the chemical free energy released from the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) into directed movements along filaments of the cytoskeleton . in cells ,",
    "these motors drive various transport processes , and are also involved in cell division , cell locomotion , and reorganization of the cytoskeleton @xcite .",
    "a lot of knowledge has been obtained from in vitro motility assays which allow for the measurement of single motor properties such as their velocities , average walking distances , step sizes , and the forces they exert @xcite .",
    "these quantities have been measured for various types of processive motors including conventional kinesin @xcite , myosin v @xcite , the processive monomeric kinesin kif1a @xcite , and cytoplasmic dynein @xcite . these motility assays study systems consisting either of ( i ) mobile motors and immobilized filaments or of ( ii ) immobilized motors and mobile filaments .",
    "in addition , systems where ( iii ) both motors and filaments are mobile and filaments can be displaced by motors have also be studied ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    in all of these systems , motors and filaments",
    "interact via hard core interactions arising from their mutual exclusion .",
    "indeed , both motors and filaments occupy a certain spatial volume which can not be occupied by another molecular structure . in particular ,",
    "motors bound to filaments exclude other motors from the binding sites of the filaments .",
    "the latter exlusion effects were first addressed in our previous work @xcite in which we introduced a general class of driven lattice gas models for this purpose .    in the following , we use these",
    "driven lattice gas models in order to explore how the arrangement of the filaments affects the motor transport in closed compartments .",
    "we consider _ uniaxial _ and _ centered _ filament arrangements and present results for the stationary patterns of both motor density and motor current .",
    "both types of arrangements are accessible to in vitro experiments and mimic structures of the cytoskeleton as observed in vivo .",
    "the uniaxial systems mimic the geometry of axons or fungal hyphae , while centered systems are realized , for example , in the aster - like structures of microtubules extending from centrosomes . for the uniaxial systems",
    ", we have previously shown that traffic jams build up easily as a consequence of mutual exclusion @xcite , while previous work on centered systems @xcite did not incorporate this mutual exclusion .",
    "we will show in the following that uniaxial and centered systems exhibit rather different jamming behavior .",
    "while in uniaxial systems jammed regions grow upon increasing the motor concentration and spread over the whole system , the effect of jamming in centered systems is less dramatic and jams remain small in this case . increasing the motor concentration , however , influences the density profile in the non - jammed region . in addition , we show that the traffic jams in uniaxial systems are rather insensitive to the motor behavior at the end of the filaments .",
    "in contrast , the latter behavior is crucial for the presence of jams in centered systems .",
    "the density profiles discussed here theoretically can be directly measured in biomimetic experiments in vitro , and , in fact , such density profiles have recently been measured for the case of centered or aster - like systems @xcite . however , the latter experiment did not address the jamming behavior , which could be done by increasing the motor concentration in these systems .",
    "in addition , our theoretical density profiles can be compared to motor density profiles measured for the corresponding systems in vivo .",
    "such in vivo density profiles have been reported for fungal hyphae , which represent uniaxial systems . @xcite have observed motors localized at the tip of these hyphae , which corresponds again to the case of low motor density . in vivo",
    ", the motor concentration can be changed by changing the level of expression of the corresponding gene ; in that way jam - like density profiles have recently been observed for another fungal kinesin - like motor @xcite .",
    "the effect of exclusion ( and , thus , jamming ) is enhanced if the motors transport large cargoes such as membranous organelles .",
    "jam - like behavior of organelles has been observed in axons ( w. saxton , private communication ) , extreme cases induced by mutations of motors ( which are lethal in later stages of development ) are accompanied by strong swelling of the axon @xcite .",
    "our article is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the theoretical model in the following section . in the sections",
    "density profiles for uniaxial filament systems and density profiles for centered filament systems we discuss jamming effects in two types of filament systems and present results for the motor density patterns obtained from monte carlo simulations and from a two - state model .",
    "finally , we relate our results to recent experiments in the discussion section .",
    "the appendices describe the theoretical methods used in this article and some analytical calculations .",
    "in this article , we study the stationary profiles of the motor density which build up within closed compartments containing filaments . these stationary states are characterized by the balance of bound and unbound motor currents @xcite .",
    "unbinding of motors from the filaments reflects the finite binding energy of the motor  filament complex which can be overcome by thermal fluctuations and leads to peculiar random walks of the motors which consist of alternating sequences of directed motion along filaments and non - directed diffusion in the surrounding fluid @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tubeastergeom](a ) . in order to study these random walks ,",
    "we have recently introduced lattice models @xcite .",
    "one useful feature of these models is that one can incorporate motor  motor interactions such as the mutual exclusion in a rather natural way @xcite .",
    "motor interactions are especially important on the filaments : motors are strongly attracted to filaments , so that the local density of motors on these filaments will typically be large even if the overall motor concentration is rather small .",
    "the importance of motor  motor interactions is further increased if motors accumulate in certain regions of closed compartments .",
    "mutual exclusion of motors from binding sites of the filaments has two effects : ( i ) binding of motors to the filament is reduced for those filament segments which are already occupied by many motors .",
    "this effect is directly observed in decoration experiments ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( ii ) the mutual hindrance slows down the movement of motors in regions of high motor density .",
    "this second effect has not yet been studied experimentally , but there are indications of it in microtubule gliding assays @xcite . in addition , there is indirect evidence for such a slowing down from the self - organization of microtubules and motors , where an increase of motor concentration can induce a transition from vortex to aster patterns of microtubules @xcite . from computer simulations ,",
    "such a transition is expected if the motors spend more time close to the end of a filament .",
    "this should happen if the motors are slowed down at the filament end by a traffic jam which builds up upon increasing the motor concentrations .",
    "in the following , we describe the movements of molecular motors as random walks on a three - dimensional cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "one or several lines of lattice sites represent one or several filaments . the lattice constant @xmath3 is taken to be the repeat distance of the filament which is 8  nm for kinesins moving along microtubules , so that filament sites of the lattice correspond to binding sites of the filament . a motor bound to a filament performs a biased random walk which describes the active movements along the filament . per unit time @xmath4",
    ", it attempts to make forward and backward steps with probability @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . as backward steps are rare for cytoskeletal motors , we take @xmath7 in the following which eliminates one parameter from our systems . rather similar behavior is found for small nonzero values of @xmath6 . with probability @xmath8 , the bound motor makes no step , and with probability @xmath9 , it unbinds to each of the four adjacent non - filament sites .",
    "the sum of all hopping probabilities per unit time @xmath4 is one , i.e.  the probabilities are related by @xmath10    when the motor particle reaches the end of the filament , it does not have the possibility to step forward to another filament site .",
    "we will consider two different unbinding processes for this ` last ' filament site as in our previous work ( klumpp and lipowsky , 2003 ) :     _ thermal unbinding : _ the motor particle detaches from the ` last ' filament site with probability @xmath9 to the unbound site in the forward direction , but remains at the last site with probability @xmath11 , while the backward probability @xmath6 and the sideward probability @xmath9 remain unchanged .",
    "adjusting the no - step probability implies the modified normalization @xmath12 for the hopping probabilities at the ` last ' filament site .    ",
    "_ active unbinding : _ the motor particle detaches from the ` last ' site with probability @xmath5 in the forward direction and with probability @xmath9 in the four sideward directions as for all other filament sites . in this case , the normalization of the hopping probabilities at the ` last ' filament site is given by ( 1 ) .",
    "an unbound motor performs a symmetric random walk which corresponds to non - directed diffusive movement .",
    "it attempts to step to each adjacent lattice site with equal probability @xmath13 .",
    "if an unbound motor reaches a filament site , it can bind to this site with probability @xmath14 .",
    "the random walk probabilities can be chosen in such a way that one recovers the measured transport properties of specific motors such as the bound state velocity , the unbound diffusion coefficient and the average walking distance ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the unbound diffusion coefficient @xmath15 fixes the basic time scale @xmath16 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath17 are determined from the velocity @xmath18 of a single bound motor , the average walking distance along the filament @xmath19 , the condition @xmath7 and eq .",
    "[ sumprob ]",
    ".    mutual exclusion of motors is taken into account by rejecting all hopping attempts to lattice sites which are occupied by other motors .",
    "we take the motor particles to have a linear size comparable to the filament repeat distance @xmath3 and to occupy a volume @xmath20 .",
    "if the motors are attached to larger cargoes , exclusion is enhanced .",
    "in particular , a large cargo of linear size @xmath21 , when bound to the filament , effectively covers between @xmath21 and @xmath22 filament sites depending on the bound density . however , the functional relationships between the different densities and current are rather similar @xcite",
    ". we will briefly discuss this case at the end of the paper in the discussion section .",
    "these lattice models for systems with many molecular motors are related to driven lattice gas models which have been studied extensively in the context of non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite . in the models studied here , the driving , i.e.  the active directed movement",
    ", is restricted to the linear subspaces corresponding to the filaments .    in the following",
    ", we will usually express all lengths and times in units of the filament repeat distance @xmath3 and the basic time scale @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "this means that the bound and unbound motor densities @xmath23 and @xmath24 that we will consider in the following are local particle number densities satisfying @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which corresponds to @xmath27 and @xmath28 in dimensionful units .",
    "dimensionful units will be used when presenting results for specific motor molecules .      in this article , we study two types of filament arrangements within closed compartments as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tubeastergeom](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the first type is a uniaxial filament system where a closed cylindrical tube contains a number @xmath29 of uniaxially arranged filaments , i.e.  filaments oriented parallel to the cylinder axis and with the same orientation .",
    "we denote the coordinate parallel to the filament by @xmath30 and the coordinates perpendicular to it by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the tube has length @xmath33 and radius @xmath34 .",
    "the second type of system which we will study is a centered filament system , i.e. , a radial or aster - like arrangement of filaments within a closed disk - like compartment .",
    "the number of filaments is again @xmath29 . in this case , we denote the radial coordinate by @xmath35 .",
    "the linear extension of the compartment along the direction of the filaments , i.e.  the disk radius , is denoted by @xmath33 and the disk height by @xmath36 .    in both cases , we take all filaments to have the same length which is equal to the corresponding linear extension of the compartment , i.e.  to the tube length and to the disk radius in the case of uniaxial and centered filament systems , respectively .",
    "shorter filaments lead to very similar results .",
    "an example would be filaments in radial arrangements which are nucleated from a centrosome and extend from @xmath37 , the centrosome radius , to the disk radius @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , since the compartments are closed , and the number of motors , denoted by @xmath39 , stays constant within each compartment .",
    "we first consider uniaxial arrangements of filaments within a closed tube as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tubeastergeom](b ) . on the one hand , placing one or several filaments and motors inside a tube should be experimentally feasible .",
    "the tube could be either a glass tube as used for micropipettes , a topographic channel as used for filament guiding @xcite , or a liquid microchannel on a chemically structured surface @xcite . in all cases , tube diameters down to a few @xmath40",
    "m can be achieved .",
    "on the other hand , tube - like geometries are also quite common in cells , the most prominent example being the axon of a nerve cell , a tubular cell compartment with a diameter in the range of few micrometers and a length of up to a meter , which contains tens of microtubules per @xmath41 @xcite , i.e. , typical distances of the microtubules are in the range of 100  nm . similar compartments , the hyphae , exist in the case of fungal cells .",
    "in addition , some compartments inside the cell have tubular shapes and contain filaments such as strands of cytosol crossing vacuoles in plant cells , again with diameters in the micron range",
    ".    we will now focus on the case of a single filament , since the case of @xmath29 isopolar parallel filaments in a tube with cross - section @xmath42 is essentially equivalent to a single filament in a tube with cross - section @xmath43 provided that the filaments are equally distributed within the tube .",
    "( if the filaments are concentrated in a certain region , i.e. , if the distance between filaments is small compared to the distance between filaments and the tube wall , depletion of motors is enhanced ; depletion effects are rather weak , however . )",
    "let us consider a cylindrical tube of length @xmath33 and radius @xmath34 with one filament located along its symmetry axis .",
    "imagine now that a certain number of motors is placed into this tube . in the absence of atp",
    ", the system attains an equilibrium state , where binding to and unbinding from the filament balance each other locally , i.e.   at every single binding site .",
    "both the bound and the unbound motor densities are constant and related by the radial equilibrium condition @xmath44 where the terms @xmath45 and @xmath46 describe mutual exclusion of bound and unbound motors , respectively , with @xmath47 for typical experimental situations .    when atp is added to the system ,",
    "the motors start to move along the filament .",
    "we use the convention that the filaments are oriented in such a way that the bound motors move to the right .",
    "the motor current along the filament builds up a density gradient , which generates a diffusive current . in the stationary state , this diffusive current balances the drift current of bound motors . as a first approximation",
    ", we assume that eq .",
    "[ equilibrium_withexclusion ] is also valid in the presence of atp ( which is justified if the velocity @xmath48 is sufficiently small , as we will show below ) .",
    "the balance of currents can then be expressed by @xmath49 it follows from this relation that , for low motor densities , the motor density increases exponentially along the filament and that motors accumulate at the right end of the filament , further increasing the importance of exclusion effects there .",
    "typical density profiles as obtained from monte carlo simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dichteprofiletube ] ( a ) .",
    "if the total number @xmath39 of motors is relatively small  one example is provided by @xmath50 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dichteprofiletube ]  motors are essentially localized at the right end of the tube .",
    "crowding of motors occurs only in a short region at the end of the filament where motors form a kind of traffic jam . to the left of the traffic jam",
    ", the density has an exponential profile as predicted by the simple balance of active directed currents and diffusive currents .",
    "if a motor detaches from the filament in the crowded region , it will diffuse back over a certain distance and most likely rebind to the filament in the region to the left of the traffic jam . in the jammed region rebinding",
    "is strongly reduced , since essentially all binding sites are already occupied . upon rebinding to the filament , the motor will move relatively fast to the right until it ends up in the jammed region again .",
    "these observations imply the coexistence of a low - density region with an exponential density profile and a crowded high - density region , separated by a relatively sharp domain wall or interface which corresponds to the beginning of the traffic jam .",
    "if the number of motors in the tube is increased , the jammed region spreads further to the left and the domain boundary is shifted towards smaller values of the spatial coordinate @xmath30 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dichteprofiletube ] for @xmath51 .",
    "now , motors diffuse backwards over larger distances , since attempts to rebind to the filament fail , if the binding sites are already occupied .",
    "finally , if the motor concentration is very large , there is only one domain with a high density of bound motors : the filament is crowded over its whole length and the bound density profile is essentially constant except for the regions close to the two ends of the filament , see the case @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dichteprofiletube ] . in this case",
    ", motors may diffuse back over the whole system length , but both the diffusive current and the bound current along the filament are very small .",
    "the corresponding profiles of the bound motor current along the filament are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dichteprofiletube](b ) .",
    "the diffusive current of unbound motors integrated over the tube cross - section has the same absolute value , but the opposite sign .",
    "the current depends strongly on the position @xmath30 along the filament as long as the filament is not completely jammed . like the motor densities , it increases exponentially in the low density region . in the jammed region at the right end of the tube ,",
    "the current decreases rapidly .",
    "it reaches its maximum close to the end of the traffic jam .",
    "note that the maximal current accessible in these systems is smaller than @xmath53 , i.e.  smaller than the maximally possible current in a system with constant densities such as a tube system with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "for the case of the completely jammed filament , the current profile is nearly flat , while the absolute current is small .    to obtain a global characterization of transport in the system , we determined the average current defined by @xmath54 this quantity exhibits a maximum at an optimal motor concentration as a function of the total number @xmath39 of motors in the system , i.e. , as a function of the overall motor concentration , see fig .",
    "[ fig : strommax ] . for small @xmath39",
    ", it grows linearly with the number of motors , while for large @xmath39 it decreases again since motion of the bound motors is slowed down by the increasing traffic jam .",
    "however , this decrease of the currents is rather slow , since additional motors introduced into the system can only rarely find free binding sites .",
    "for the system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strommax ] , the maximal current occurs for @xmath55 motors , which corresponds to the intermediate case of the profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : dichteprofiletube ] .",
    "a second quantity , which gives a global characterization of the profiles , is the traffic jam length @xmath56 of the crowded domain .",
    "@xmath56 can be defined by the condition @xmath57 via @xmath58 .",
    "results for @xmath56 are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strommax ] . the three cases discussed above",
    "can now be distinguished as follows .",
    "for very small @xmath59 , crowding of motors only occurs in a small region at the filament end and the profile decays exponentially to the left over a large fraction of the system size . for intermediate values of @xmath59 with @xmath60 , the density profiles exhibit coexistence of domains with high and low bound motor densities .",
    "finally , for @xmath61 the whole filament is crowded . comparing the functional dependence of the traffic jam length @xmath56 with",
    "the average bound current @xmath62 shows that the optimal transport occurs when a large part of the filament is crowded , @xmath63 , but the traffic jam is not yet too dense .",
    "to get some further insight into the properties of these self - organized density profiles , we studied the stationary states of these systems using a two - state model . in this model , which is described in detail in appendix [ sec : methods ] ,",
    "the dependence of the concentration profiles on the radial coordinate is neglected and motors can be in two states , namely bound and unbound .",
    "this approximation is justified , because the profile of the unbound motor density depends only weakly on the radial coordinate .",
    "the two - state approximation captures most of the relevant features of these profiles and numerical solutions for the stationary profiles are obtained much faster than by monte carlo simulations .",
    "for the uniaxial systems , the two - state model as defined in appendix [ sec : methods ] is given by @xmath64 = \\phi d_{{\\rm ub}}\\big[\\rho_{{\\rm ub}}(x+1)-\\rho_{{\\rm ub}}(x)\\big]\\ ] ] and @xmath65- v_{{\\rm b}}\\rho_{{\\rm b}}(x-1)\\big[1- \\rho_{{\\rm b}}(x)\\big ] = { \\tilde\\pi_{\\rm ad}}\\rho_{{\\rm ub}}(x)\\big[1- \\rho_{{\\rm b}}(x)\\big ] -\\tilde\\epsilon\\rho_{{\\rm b}}(x)\\big[1- \\rho_{{\\rm ub}}(x)\\big].\\ ] ] these equations express the balance of bound and unbound currents and the binding to and unbinding from the filament , respectively , see appendix [ sec : methods ] .    for the non - jammed low density region , some analytical results can be obtained from these equations which are presented in appendix [ sec : app : lowdensity ] .",
    "in particular , an exponential increase of the density profile is obtained as @xmath66 with a length scale @xmath67 as given by eq .",
    "[ eq : xi_aus2state ] .    in order",
    "to obtain results for arbitrary densities , we solved the two - state equations [ master_eq_axon_1][master_eq_axon_2 ] numerically .",
    "some profiles of the bound motor density as well as the average current as a function of the number of motors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dichteprofiletubenum ] for a relatively large system with @xmath68 .",
    "while the main features are the same as for the smaller system discussed above , some additional details can be seen here .",
    "the current increases linearly with the number @xmath39 of motors for small @xmath39 , but at a certain point , @xmath69 or @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dichteprofiletubenum](b ) , the slope begins to change .",
    "the current then increases more slowly , but again nearly linearly , until it reaches its maximum .",
    "this change in slope of the current corresponds to the formation of a plateau in the density profile , where the density in the traffic jam is approximately constant and changes only little upon addition of motors .    until now",
    ", we have assumed thermal detachment , i.e. , that detachment at the end of the filament occurs with the same rate as detachment at any other site of the filament . as mentioned before , see eq .",
    "[ thermalunbindlast ] , a second possibility is active unbinding , i.e. , that motors detach with an increased rate at the end by making an active step which leads to unbinding .",
    "there is some indirect evidence for a quicker detachment of kinesin motors at the microtubule end from experiments and computer simulation of the formation of aster and vortex patterns of microtubule by motors @xcite . in simulations ,",
    "quick detachment at the microtubule end leads to the formation of vortex ( or spiral - like ) structures , while slow detachment is necessary for the formation of asters - like centered arrangements .",
    "kinesin is able to form both asters and vortices , suggesting that detachment at the microtubule end is relatively quick , while the kinesin - related motor ncd only forms asters and thus probably detaches slowly at the microtubule end @xcite .",
    "we have determined density profiles for both cases using the two - state approach , see fig .",
    "[ fig : profilemodifmodel ] .",
    "these density profiles show that the jamming behavior is rather insensitive to the motor behavior at the end of the filaments . except for the region very close to the filament end ,",
    "the profiles for the two cases agree well .",
    "in particular , the domain wall or interface represented by the steep increase of the density profile at the beginning of the traffic jam is the same in both cases .",
    "this observation shows that the traffic jam is not due to the slow unbinding at the end , but due to the accumulation of motors with an exponential density profile , which follows from the balance of bound drift current and unbound diffusive currents in a uniaxial geometry . on the other hand ,",
    "the density profile within the jammed region depends strongly on the detachment rate at the filament end .",
    "while there is a weak increase of the bound density inside the jammed region for small detachment rate at the filament end , the bound density decreases strongly in this region in the case of an increased detachment rate at the end , see fig .",
    "[ fig : profilemodifmodel ] .",
    "comparing the density profiles obtained from the two - state model with those obtained from simulations for the same parameter set , we find quite good agreement in the case where the entire filament is crowded by motors . for smaller overall motor concentrations ,",
    "qualitative agreement is still good ( except for the region close to the left boundary , see appendix [ sec : app : lowdensity ] ) , but there are small quantitative discrepancies .",
    "we find that the length scale @xmath67 of the exponential increase of the density is smaller in the two - state model than in the simulations .",
    "correspondingly the crowded region is slightly longer in this approximation .",
    "this difference is due to neglecting a depletion zone close to the filament in the two - state model .",
    "close to the filament , the unbound motor density is smaller than its radial average in the low - density region . taking it as independent of the radial coordinate , we thus overestimate binding of motors to the filament .",
    "therefore there are more motors bound to the filament in the two - state model than in the simulations , which results in a longer traffic jam , and the maximum of the current is shifted to a smaller number of motors in the system .    in order to obtain a quantitative description of the radial density profiles ,",
    "we have solved the full three - dimensional diffusion equation for the low - density region and derived an analytical expression for the depletion layer close to the filament as shown in appendix [ sec : app : depletionlayer ] .",
    "it follows from the latter expression that the radial profile of the unbound density is nearly flat far from the filament and exhibits a logarithmic depletion zone close to the filament .",
    "this confirms the observation that the unbound motor density depends only weakly on the radial coordinate which justifies the two - state approach . comparing the results from this calculation with the simulation of the full model",

    "the traffic jam is however rather short and , in contrast to the case of uniaxially aligned filaments , does not grow substantially in length , when the number of motors in the system is increased , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mdichte_inout](a ) .",
    "jamming of motors occurs only for small @xmath35 ( @xmath100 m ) . for this range of @xmath35 ,",
    "no experimental data are available .",
    "in contrast to the case of uniaxial systems , the motor behavior at the end of the filaments is crucial for the presence of jams in centered filament systems : if motors unbind actively at the filament ends ( in the center of the aster ) , traffic jams are absent as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aster_end](a ) . in the regions with low motor densities ,",
    "the density profiles for thermal ( slow ) and active ( fast ) detachment at the ends of the filaments agree perfectly .",
    "the main effect of the mutual exclusion is that density profiles get more and more flat with increasing motor concentration in the system , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mdichte_inout](a ) .",
    "this means that the power law profile is found only for small overall motor concentrations .",
    "the average current in the system exhibits again a maximum at an optimal motor concentration .",
    "the maximum occurs at a motor concentration , where the bound motor density becomes nearly constant and the power law behavior is hardly identified .      for motors moving outwards in an aster",
    "we obtain profiles as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdichte_inout](b ) . for small numbers of motors ( and not too close to the boundaries )",
    "the bound density follows the power law obtained from the linear equations .",
    "now the exponent @xmath101 is positive but small . with increasing motor concentration",
    ", the profile of the bound density gets again more and more flat and the filaments become more and more crowded . as in the case of outward movements , however , the jams at the end of the filaments grow only very weakly and remain rather small ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the motor behavior at the filament ends is crucial for the presence of these jams also in this case , and jams are absent if motors unbind quickly at the filament ends , see fig .",
    "[ fig : aster_end](b ) .",
    "the new feature compared to the previous case is that the profile of the total motor concentration , which is rather flat for small motor concentration , develops a pronounced maximum in the center of the aster as the number of motors is increased beyond the optimal motor concentration , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mdichte_inout](b ) . this can be understood in the following way : if no atp is added to the system , motors will accumulate in the center of the aster , simply because they bind strongly to the filaments , and , in the center , the number of binding sites per unit area is maximal .",
    "if atp is added , motors are driven outwards by active directed motion .",
    "if now the number of motors in the system is increased , so that the motor movements are slowed down by the exclusion effect , the outward drift is suppressed and accumulation in the center is successively restored .",
    "we have presented theoretical results for the density profiles of molecular motors in arrays of cytoskeletal filaments .",
    "motors were described as particles which move actively , i.e.  in a directed manner , when they are bound to cytoskeletal filaments , but undergo non - directed diffusion upon unbinding from filaments .",
    "in addition , motor particles interact via mutual exclusion . on the one hand",
    ", these models are designed to describe the generic behavior of the movements of molecular motors ; on the other hand , the model parameters can be adapted to the transport properties of specific motor molecules . in general , these models involve certain simplifications compared to real systems .",
    "we have therefore tested a few modifications of the models to check that a more detailed modeling does not change our conclusions .",
    "mutual exclusion of motors is obviously enhanced , if the motors carry large cargoes such as latex beads or vesicles .",
    "furthermore , microtubules consist of 1214 protofilaments which correspond to 1214 parallel tracks ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the uniaxial geometry",
    ", we have performed simulations of lattice models for which these two features have been incorporated . in these latter simulations ,",
    "motors which occupy a cubic volume of @xmath103 lattice sites move on a microtubule consisting of 12 protofilaments arranged in a tubular geometry . in the simulations we chose @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "these cargoes can mimic small vesicles with diameters of some tens of nanometers . in vivo",
    ", the cargo diameters lie between a few nanometers for a single protein or rna molecule and hundreds of nanometers for a large organelle .",
    "in addition , these model cargoes attach to the filament only with one of their surface sites , which represents the motor .",
    "therefore , those cargoes which are not bound to the filament have an additional rotational degree of freedom .",
    "the resulting density profiles are averaged over @xmath106 subsequent lattice sites , because the unrealistic cubic shape of the cargoes and the rigidity of their attachment to the motors leads to an artificial sublattice structure in the crowded region .",
    "we then obtain density profiles that resemble the ones discussed above , but the value of the bound density in the crowded region is smaller , because a smaller number of motors can block the filaments . in particular , a motor bound to one protofilament also blocks binding sites of the adjacent protofilaments because of the steric hindrance induced by its large cargo .",
    "finally , let us relate our results to experiments .",
    "we have determined profiles of the motor density and motor currents in uniaxial and centered filament systems . on the one hand , these systems are directly accessible to experiments in biomimetic model systems in vitro .",
    "density profiles as discussed here have so far only been measured for the case of centered or aster - like systems @xcite ( see our footnote at the beginning of the section on centered filament systems for a discussion of the dynamics in these experiments ) .",
    "the latter experiment shows the power law profile which is obtained from the theory for low motor densities .",
    "higher motor densities and the corresponding jamming behavior have not been explored in this experiment , but could be studied in the same way by increasing the overall motor concentration . for the latter case ,",
    "our theoretical study makes detailed predictions for the density and current profiles which could be checked in such an experiment .",
    "in addition , it would be quite interesting to construct other filament arrangements and compartment shapes and to study the corresponding motor transport experimentally .",
    "on the other hand , we can also compare our theoretical results about motor traffic in closed compartments with experimental studies on motor traffic in biological cells , where , however , additional phenomena such as the dynamics of the filaments , the regulation of the motor activity and the presence of other cellular structures play also important roles . using fluorescence probes ,",
    "several groups have measured the density profiles of molecular motors in vivo .",
    "one particular interesting system are kinesin motors in fungal hyphae .",
    "these hyphae are tubular compartments which contain uniaxial filament systems . in one experiment , strong localization of kinesin",
    "has been observed at the tip of these fungal hyphae @xcite .",
    "the comet - like density profiles of these motors localized at the tip correspond to the case of low motor density in our model .",
    "however , this localization is only found for kinesin mutants lacking a certain regulatory domain , i.e.  for motors which move actively , but which are not regulated by cargo binding ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the underlying regulatory mechanism is the deactivation of the motor via folding of its tail if no cargo is bound to it @xcite .",
    "the deactivated motors do not exhibit active movement along filaments and can diffuse back over larger distances .",
    "further regulatory mechanisms have mainly been discussed for the case of axons where the question , whether and how motors are transported back is most prominent @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms include local degradation of motors at the axon terminal @xcite and backward transport by motors of opposite directionality @xcite .",
    "very recently , another fungal kinesin was also shown to localize at the tip of the hyphae and to exhibit these comet - like profiles . in this case ,",
    "larger motor concentrations were induced by increasing the level of expression of the corresponding gene .",
    "this leads to density profiles with regions of high motor density which increase in length with increasing expression level @xcite . according to our model",
    ", these density profiles should represent growing traffic jams",
    ". it would be highly desirable to repeat these experiments in vitro .",
    "in summary , we have discussed theoretically the stationary density and current profiles of molecular motors in uniaxial and centered aster - like arrangements of cytoskeletal filaments . in particular , we have explored the effects of exclusion and jamming which can be addressed in these systems by varying the overall motor concentration .",
    "the two types of filament systems , which we studied , exhibit different density profiles and different jamming behavior . for small overall motor concentrations ,",
    "the profiles are exponential in uniaxial systems , but algebraic in centered systems except for the crowded region close to the filament ends . increasing the overall motor concentration",
    ", the jammed region grows in the uniaxial geometry , resulting in the coexistence of large regions of high and low density of bound motors , while the crowded region remains small in centered systems , where larger overall motor concentrations lead to a flattening of the profile if the motors move inwards , and to the build - up of a concentration maximum in the center of the aster if motors move outwards .",
    "in addition , the jamming in the uniaxial systems is rather insensitive to the motor behavior at the ends of the filaments , while the latter behavior is crucial for the presence of jams in centered systems .",
    "both geometries studied here mimic arrangements of filaments in cells and are accessible to in vitro experiments .",
    "the predictions for both geometries can thus be tested experimentally .",
    "some density profiles have been determined experimentally .",
    "these profiles correspond mainly to the case of low motor density @xcite  only one recent experiment @xcite addresses higher motor densities  and are in agreement with our theoretical description .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations for the case of uniaxial arrangements of filaments , where filaments are located within a cylindrical tube - like compartments and aligned parallel to the cylinder axis which we take to be the @xmath30-axis .",
    "we take the filaments to have the same length @xmath33 as the tube , but we checked that shorter filaments lead to very similar results . the cylindrical tube with radius @xmath34",
