    "starting with a semisimple algebraic group , we construct a collection of polytopes .",

    "each tensor product multiplicity ( littlewood - richardson number ) is the number of polytopes in a certain set .",
    "the method is based on the geometry of the loop grassmannian , and builds directly on the work of mirkovi and vilonen  @xcite .",
    "but all algebraic geometry is deferred until section  [ sec : geometry ] since we may state the main result without it ( theorem  [ prop : statement ] ) .",
    "we do this in section  [ sec : statement ] , and follow with a lot of examples in sections  [ sec : examples ] and  [ sec : examples2 ] .",
    "much may be gained from just these first sections without ever understanding what the loop grassmannian is .",
    "some background in geometry in representation theory is discussed in section  [ sec : geometry ] .",
    "one begins by fixing an algebraic group , and constructing from it a space , the loop grassmannian .",
    "the representation theory of the ( langlands dual ) group is known to be closely related to the geometry of the loop grassmannian .",
    "this relationship was made more explicit with mirkovi and vilonen s discovery of a collection of singular algebraic varieties in the loop grassmannian , which we call mv - cycles . in terms of geometry , they provide a canonical basis for the intersection homology of the closure of each stratum of the loop grassmannian . in terms of representation theory , they provide a canonical basis for each irreducible representation of the group .    section  [ sec : momentmap ] provides a definition of the polytopes as moment map images of mv - cycles .",
    "the rest of the paper consists mainly of the proof of theorem  [ prop : statement ] .",
    "section  [ sec : fibers ] contains the main geometric idea and is of interest in its own right ( theorem  [ prop : fiber ] ) .",
    "the last section provides a glimpse at a closely related hopf algebra .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected semisimple complex algebraic group of rank @xmath1 . choose a maximal torus @xmath2 .",
    "we will be considering polytopes in the real @xmath1-dimensional vector space in which pictures of roots and weights are usually drawn : this is the dual @xmath3 of the lie algebra of the split real form of @xmath4 .",

    "the parameter set @xmath8 is naturally graded by @xmath7 : @xmath9 .",
    "it turns out that this parameter set is not important in the theorem below , since the parametrization @xmath10 is injective  @xcite ; so we will really be counting polytopes .",
    "we also write @xmath11 so that @xmath12 .    among our polytopes will be ( shifts of ) those familiar from representation : the convex hull of the weights in an irreducible representation of @xmath0 ; @xmath13 denotes the convex hull of the weyl group orbit through a weight @xmath14 .",
    "weight multiplicities and tensor product multiplicities may be calculated according to the following rules .    1 .",

    "[ prop : statement ]    the polytopes in @xmath25 are called mv - polytopes .",
    "the `` mv '' stands for mirkovi and vilonen , who discovered a collection of algebraic varieties called mv - cycles .",
    "mv - polytopes will be defined as moment map images of mv - cycles .",
    "part 1 of the theorem is little more than a translation of some of the algebraic geometry of mirkovi and vilonen into the language of polytopes .",
    "part 2 , however , depends on some more geometry described in section  [ sec : fibers ] .",
    "we explicitly describe the collection of polytopes @xmath25 for a few low rank groups : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "this is not known for other groups , although mirkovi and i have a conjecture that inductively constructs the polytopes for any group  @xcite .    before describing _ all _ the polytopes for these groups , we introduce them with a picture of eight of them , which count the weight multiplicities in the adjoint representation of @xmath27 .",
    "the weight multiplicity is 1 at each outer vertex , and 2 at the central vertex .        to describe the polytopes",
    ", it is easiest to first introduce a commutative algebra @xmath30 with basis @xmath25 .",
    "this algebra is discussed briefly in section  [ sec : hopf ] ; conjecturally it is the algebra of functions on the unipotent radical of a borel subgroup  @xcite . in these examples",
    "we give ad hoc definitions of @xmath30 by a natural set of generators and relations .",
    "then a collection of monomials in the generators is defined .",
    "a polytope is associated to each generator , and then to each monomial by taking the minkowski sum of the factors .",
    "( the minkowski sum of two sets @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the set of sums @xmath33 . )",
    "@xmath34 $ ] and the mv - polytopes @xmath35 $ ] correspond to monomials @xmath36 .",
    "( @xmath37 is the negative root in @xmath38 . )",
    "the algebra @xmath30 has four generators :        ( the negative roots are indicated . for each polytope ,",
    "the vertex with highest weight is at the origin . )",
    "there is a single relation , @xmath39 , which we put in a diagram :        the mv - polytopes correspond to monomials of the form @xmath40 or @xmath41 , i.e. those monomials in the generators such that not both @xmath42 and @xmath43 occur .",
    "these are the monomials that can not be further simplified using the relations .",
    "again , the mv - polytopes are found by taking minkowski sums .",
    "for example , the regular hexagon @xmath44 is the minkowski sum of the two triangles . in general , the monomials @xmath45 give shifts of the symmetric hexagons @xmath13 .",
    "one can think of an arbitrary mv - polytope as one of these hexagons stretched some length in the direction of either @xmath42 or @xmath43 .    as an aside ,",
    "note that the relation @xmath39 has an interpretation in terms of minkowski sum : the minkowski sum of the two line segments @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a parallelogram which equals the union of the two triangles @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in general , if @xmath48 then the minkowski sum of @xmath37 and @xmath49 equals the union of the @xmath50 for which @xmath51 .",
    "( see  @xcite . )    the above definition places the highest weight vertex of @xmath52 at the origin .",
    "then the lowest weight vertex @xmath16 identifies the graded piece @xmath53 in which @xmath54 lies .",
    "the algebra @xmath30 has eight generators :        ( again the negative roots indicated , and the highest weight vertex is always at the origin . ) there are nine relations :        the mv - polytopes correspond to monomials of these forms : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "equivalently , these are all monomials in the generators , no two factors of which are joined by a line in the diagram of relations .",
    "the monomials @xmath61 give shifts of the symmetric octagons @xmath13 .",
    "the grading is specified exactly as it was for @xmath27 .",
    "the example of @xmath29 is very rich , and harder to think about since the polytopes are three - dimensional .",
    "there are twelve generators :        these are drawn relative to an octahedron whose front left vertex is the origin of @xmath62 .",
    "the three line segments @xmath63 identify the simple negative roots .",
    "the @xmath64 are triangles ; @xmath65 are square - based pyramids ; @xmath66 are tetrahedra ; @xmath67 is an octahedron .",
    "here are the fifteen relations :        as before , the collection of monomials consists of those for which no two factors are joined by a line in this diagram .",
    "we use the mv - polytopes for @xmath28 in two examples , illustrating the two parts of theorem  [ prop : statement ] .",
    "this illustrates part 1 of theorem  [ prop : statement ] .",
    "the octagon below corresponds to an irreducible representation of @xmath28 .",
    "suppose we want to know the weight multiplicity at the indicated weight @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath53 consists of the six polygons pictured below .",
    "each has one vertex , distinguished by a black dot , which must be placed at the weight @xmath16 .",
    "five of the polygons are contained in the octagon , and one is not ( its bottom right corner sticks out ) .",
    "so the weight multiplicity is 5 .",
    "this illustrates part 2 of theorem  [ prop : statement ] .",
    "suppose we want to decompose the tensor product of the two irreducible @xmath28 representations indicated in the picture .",
    "the dashed lines are the outlines of the irreducible summands that occur with nonzero multiplicity .",
    "the mv - polygons that were counted to find the multiplicities are drawn in black ; these were the ones contained in the intersection of the big octagon @xmath13 and the translated square @xmath68 .",
    "each summand has multiplicity 1 , except for one which has multiplicity 2 : @xmath69 .",
    "this calculation has a similar flavour to the convolution of the characters of the two representations , where one computes a sum of products of weight multiplicities instead of counting polytopes .",
    "after convolving the characters , one uses the weyl character formula to find the irreducible summands .",
    "our method required no knowledge of weight multiplicities , no arithmetic , and no separate calculation to extract the irreducible summands .",
    "of course , saying that this method is more efficient than using the weyl character formula is not saying very much .",
    "one might hope that this would provide an explicit formula for the littlewood - richardson numbers , but it seems only to provide an algorithm .",
    "our basic object of study is the loop grassmannian ( affine grassmannian ) , which is an infinite dimensional space associated to a complex algebraic group @xmath70 , taken to be connected and semisimple .",
    "it is the quotient of groups @xmath71 where @xmath72}$ ] , the ring of formal power series , and @xmath73 , its field of fractions , the ring of formal laurent series .",

    "loop_. there is a model of @xmath80 due to lusztig which describes it as a set of subspaces of an infinite dimensional vector space , which explains the use of _ grassmannian _  @xcite .",
    "@xmath80 may be realized as an increasing union of finite dimensional complex projective varieties by filtering @xmath81 by order of pole  @xcite .",

    "is our notation for this : fix a maximal torus @xmath83 .",

    "each stratum @xmath88 is a complex vector bundle over a flag manifold for @xmath70 . for a coweight @xmath14 in the interior of the positive weyl chamber",
    "this is the full flag manifold , but if @xmath14 lies on a weyl chamber wall then it is some partial flag manifold .",

    "the dimension of @xmath251 is the height of @xmath252 , which is strictly smaller than the height of @xmath211 unless @xmath253 , @xmath254 .",
