    "reverberation mapping @xcite is an important technique for probing the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centers of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "measuring the time lags , @xmath2 , between fluctuations in the highly variable agn continuum and the variations of emission lines arising from the broad - line region ( blr ) provides a responsivity - weighted radius for the blr gas distribution around the smbh .",
    "when emission - line time lags are combined with calculations of the gas velocity width , @xmath3 , under the assumption of virialized gas motions , it becomes possible to estimate the smbh mass .",
    "multiple lines of evidence suggest that to assume a virialized blr is a reasonable approximation . in agns",
    "for which several emission lines have been reverberation - mapped ( ngc  5548 , 3c  390.3 , ngc  7469 , ngc  3783 ) , an inverse relationship is found between @xmath2 and @xmath3 that is consistent with expectations from virialization @xcite .",
    "in addition , the close concordance between agns and quiescent galaxies in the @xmath4-@xmath1 plane under the virial assumption ( relating black hole mass to the stellar velocity dispersion of the galactic spheroid ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would seem to imply that any systematic error in reverberation masses is small ( a factor of @xmath53 or less ) .",
    "@xcite estimated a similar level of expected systematic scatter assuming gravitational domination of the blr .",
    "most of the statistical studies of reverberation - based black - hole masses use the homogeneous compilations of wandel , peterson , & malkan ( 1999 , hereafter wpm ) and @xcite . missing from these compilations",
    "are agns observed by the `` lovers of active galaxies ( lag ) '' collaboration that monitored several agns in early 1990 @xcite .",
    "three of the lag sources , ngc  3227 @xcite , ngc  3516 @xcite , and ngc  4593 @xcite , have well - determined emission - line lags and certainly meet the quality criteria for inclusion in these studies , and indeed were included in the compilation of ho ( 1999 ; based on h@xmath6  only ) .",
    "these galaxies were omitted from the wpm compilation only because the data had not been analyzed in the same fashion as the other sources ; specifically , ( a ) wpm use the model - independent monte carlo method of @xcite to assess uncertainties in emission - line lags , and ( b ) wpm use the fwhm of the emission - line in the root - mean - square ( rms ) spectrum , rather than the mean spectrum , to characterize the blr line - of - sight velocity width , @xmath7 , that is used to form the virial product ( @xmath7)@xmath8 . because we have converted both our time lags and velocity widths to the agn rest frame , our results supplement the compilation of @xcite .",
    "( wpm did not correct for the time dilation of their @xmath2 values . )    in this contribution , we reanalyze the lag data on these three sources in the same fashion as @xcite , with the intent of enlarging that homogeneous database .",
    "the total number of agns which have been reverberation - mapped ( a few dozen ) is small enough that additional objects will assist in on - going statistical investigations of ( what are hoped to be ) fundamental physical relationships .",
    "the main aspect on which we have worked is the careful construction the rms spectra over the spans of the respective observing campaigns . with the rms spectra for these agns and",
    "updated time lag values and uncertainties , we are able to derive masses for the smbhs in these three galaxies .    in   2 , we briefly describe the original observing campaigns and our data reduction .",
    "we explain the details of our time series and velocity width analyses in   3 .",
    "our estimates of the smbh mass in each galaxy are presented in   4 . in   5 , we address the m@xmath0-@xmath1 relationship , and we then summarize our conclusions (   6 ) .",
    "the lag consortium examined the h@xmath9  and h@xmath6  wavelength regimes with long slit spectroscopy of moderate resolution and with the temporal sampling rates listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the line marked `` cont . '' in table [ tab1 ] for ngc  3516 indicates the sampling statistics derived for the combination of imaging and spectroscopic measurements of the @xmath54000 - 5000  continuum .",
    "the continuum statistics for ngc  3227 and ngc  4593 are identical to the h@xmath6  and h@xmath9  entries , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 indicates the `` excess variance , '' the mean fractional variation of each dataset ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio of the maximum to minimum flux value is given in table [ tab1 ] as @xmath11 .",
    "in general , no alterations were applied to the published light curve data . however , in order to investigate the velocity width characteristics of the broad emission lines , we used the wavelength region around the narrow lines ( [ ] and [ ] , which should only vary on timescales much longer than the campaigns ) to scale the spectra @xcite .",
    "the absolute scaling was done so as to yield mean narrow - line fluxes equal to the values derived in the original papers .",
    "the slit width selected was an attempt to balance spectral resolution and total detected flux .",
    "however , the small slit width introduced a non - trivial degree of difficulty in the removal of seeing effects , as noted below .",
    "the lag campaign on ngc  3227 was described by @xcite .",
    "the analysis was complicated by the fact that the two methods they employed for removing the contribution of the stellar host gave significantly different answers : they derived a 24% contribution to the continuum by examining the magnesium triplet of a template galaxy of the same hubble type , and a 40% continuum contribution from comparisons with the magnesium triplet absorption of the bulge of ngc  3227 .",
    "we analyzed the data with each of the potential stellar levels removed and found the differences to be insignificant .",
    "a detailed investigation of various origins of uncertainty in their flux calibration was conducted by a portion of the lag group @xcite .",
    "in addition to the effects of slit miscentering and seeing , they estimate the uncertainties incurred by their scaling of the spectra by the narrow lines , and conclude an overall flux error of 58% . we have assumed the more conservative 8% errors for all of the flux data .",
    "our analysis made use of the full lag dataset , consisting of 23 h@xmath9  observations and 14 h@xmath6  observations .",
    "the light curve cross - correlations were made with respect to the continuum at 5020 .",
    "the systemic redshift of ngc  3227 was taken to be @xmath12 = 0.00380 @xmath13 0.00002 @xcite .",
    "spectra of ngc  3516 were taken at 22 separate epochs for h@xmath9  and 21 epochs for h@xmath6 .",
    "the continuum light curve for this object was constructed from a combination of b - band imaging and spectral fits to the power - law continuum at 4905 .",
    "the results of the lag study have been published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectra we obtained for this object had already been corrected for seeing , the stellar flux from the host galaxy , and contributions from narrow lines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the [ ] and [ ] narrow lines had been subtracted from the h@xmath9  and h@xmath6  spectra , respectively , preventing any rescaling of the flux levels .",
    "several observations were removed from the calculation of the rms spectrum for a variety of reasons ( extremely poor seeing , object miscentering , and other anomalies ) . among the h@xmath9",
    "dataset , we have excised observations from the following dates : 31 january , 16 february , 15 april , and 13 may . from the h@xmath6  analysis",
    "we have removed 24 march , 15 april , and 13 may .",
    "conversion of time lags and line - of - sight velocity widths to the rest frame was made with @xmath12 = 0.00884 @xmath13 0.00002 @xcite .",
    "spectra of ngc  4593 were obtained at 22 epochs around h@xmath9  and at 11 epochs around h@xmath6 , and the continuum used was at 6310 .",
    "the h@xmath9  line was contaminated by strong [ ] @xmath146548 , 6584 emission , as well as a narrow h@xmath9  contribution . using the shape of the narrow [ ] @xmath155007 line as a template for all of the narrow lines , and the flux ratios between the [ ] lines and narrow h@xmath9  that @xcite calculated , we have bracketed the amount of narrow line removal by limiting cases in which too much or too little narrow line flux was subtracted . conducting this for each h@xmath9  spectrum ,",
    "we then separately analyzed our oversubtracted and undersubtracted datasets .",
    "the @xmath7 difference between the oversubtraction and undersubtraction was on the order of 1% , much smaller than the @xmath7 uncertainties as well as the range of values derived by doing no rescaling of the spectra or no removal of the narrow - line contribution .",
    "we converted our results to the galaxy s rest frame using @xmath12 = 0.00900 @xmath13 0.00013 @xcite .",
    "using the published light curves , we generated the cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) between the continua and the emission lines with the interpolated ccf technique as implemented by @xcite .",
    "we calculated both the peak of each ccf ( @xmath16 ) and its centroid ( @xmath17 ; above a threshold of 80% of the peak value correlation coefficient ) with an interpolation unit of 0.1 days .    uncertainties in the time lag values were estimated with the method described by @xcite .",
    "this model - independent technique addresses two major sources of uncertainty in the ccfs .",
    "first , the issue of flux errors is handled by adding to each flux value a randomly generated deviation .",
    "this deviation is computed such that a large number of realizations will produce a gaussian scatter with a standard deviation equal to the quoted uncertainty ( this procedure is dubbed `` flux randomization ( fr ) '' ) .",
    "second , the potential errors arising from the limited temporal sampling of the observational campaign are accounted for by `` random subset selection ( rss ) . ''",
    "the rss method consists of randomly selecting @xmath18 data points from a sample of size @xmath18 , where each selection draws from the entire sample and repeated selections are ignored .",
    "this allows us to `` bootstrap '' our way to reasonable error estimates , while preserving the underlying form of the time series .",
    "the fr / rss method was implemented 1000 times for each continuum - line combination to build up a distribution of the peak and centroid time lags , denoted generally as a cross - correlation peak distribution ( ccpd ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use the ccpd to define the time lag values within which 68% of the monte carlo results lie , and these values set our time lag uncertainties .",
    "table [ tab2 ] and figure [ fig3 ] show our cross - correlation results .",
    "the procedure we applied to the mean and rms spectra of each agn was to make two estimates of the continuum , at the extrema of where the level could potentially be set .",
    "the two resulting measurements of the velocity full - width at half - maximum , @xmath7 , were then averaged and the difference taken to be twice the one - sigma errors .",
    "we give the results of our @xmath7 measurements from both the mean and rms spectra in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "for consistency with previously published compilations , we calculate the reverberation mass as @xmath19 where @xmath7 is taken from the rms spectrum , @xmath20 is the speed of light , and @xmath21 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the asymmetric errors in the time lags are propagated through to the masses derived from the individual lines .",
    "then , the masses for each line are combined in a weighted average .",
    "we have measured the reverberation masses for our three targets and present the results in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "object - specific comments and comparisons with previous results follow .",
    "the original lag estimate of the smbh mass in ngc  3227 was @xmath52@xmath2210@xmath23m@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "our value of ( 3.6@xmath131.4)@xmath2210@xmath25m@xmath24 is consistent with the mass of 4.9@xmath2610@xmath25m@xmath24 tabulated by wpm , which was based on an independent monitoring campaign @xcite .",
    "the value derived by @xcite from h@xmath6  was 3.8@xmath2210@xmath25m@xmath24 , also consistent with our new smbh mass in this galaxy .",
    "@xcite used co gas kinematics to calculate a lower mass limit of @xmath51.5@xmath2210@xmath25m@xmath24 enclosed within the central 25 pc .",
    "again , this value is fully consistent with our results .",
    "@xcite have noted the difficulty in reconciling the smbh mass estimates for ngc  3516 arising from a variety of optical , uv , and x - ray constraints within certain models of agn structure . although our final estimate of @xmath27 = ( 1.68@xmath130.33)@xmath2210@xmath25m@xmath24 lies slightly above a recent mass upper limit of ( 1.12@xmath130.05)@xmath2210@xmath25m@xmath24 derived from models of the x - ray warm absorber in this galaxy @xcite , other models of x - ray properties point towards a mass closer to 10@xmath23m@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "our results for this agn are consistent with the value of @xmath52@xmath2210@xmath25m@xmath24 from the earlier analysis of the lag data by @xcite , and also matches well the mass of 2.3@xmath2210@xmath25m@xmath24 @xcite calculated using h@xmath6  alone .",
    "recent attempts at accretion disk modeling from x - ray data have given values of 3.1@xmath2210@xmath25m@xmath24 @xcite and 2@xmath2210@xmath25m@xmath24 @xcite , both in rough agreement with the present work .",
    "for ngc  4593 , we calculate that m@xmath28 = ( 6.6@xmath135.2)@xmath2210@xmath29m@xmath24 .",
    "an earlier reverberation mapping campaign derived a mass of 2.2@xmath3010@xmath29m@xmath24 from lyman @xmath9 @xcite , and @xcite calculated m@xmath28 = 7@xmath2210@xmath29m@xmath24 from the lag h@xmath9data ( when corrected for our conversion between @xmath7 and the velocity dispersion ) .",
    "@xcite estimated a slightly larger h@xmath6  time delay and found a smbh mass of 8.1@xmath2210@xmath29m@xmath24 .",
    "with such large uncertainties , these differences can not be considered statistically significant .",
    "since the discovery of the exceptionally tight correlation between a galaxy s smbh mass and the central value of the velocity dispersion of the galaxy s spheroid ( i.e. m@xmath0-@xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a number of attempts have been made to reconcile differences in the derived slope of this relationship ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as to develop a physical framework that will naturally produce such a correlation .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite have examined whether smbh masses derived by reverberation mapping are consistent with the m@xmath0-@xmath1 relationship . because bulge velocity dispersion measurements exist for all three of our targets , we are able to enlarge the agn sample used to investigate m@xmath0-@xmath1 .    @xcite measured bulge velocity dispersions for 85 galaxies , including two of our targets .",
    "ngc  3227 was found to have @xmath1 = 128@xmath1313 km s@xmath31 , and ngc  4593 has @xmath1 = 124@xmath1329 km s@xmath31 . @xcite",
    "published a value of @xmath1 = 124@xmath135 km s@xmath31 for ngc  3516 .",
    "these values for @xmath1 , in conjunction with our derived m@xmath28 data , are consistent with the current fits to m@xmath0-@xmath1 ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this excellent agreement between the agn and quiescent galaxy m@xmath0-@xmath1 relationships is additional evidence that reverberation masses are not subject to large systematic errors .",
    "in addition , we note the relative concentrations of the agn and quiescent galaxy data in figure [ fig4 ] toward the two ends of the relationship .",
    "this is a reflection of two facts : ( 1 ) in order to measure @xmath1 in agns , the continuum emission must be weak enough so as not to wash out the stellar absorption lines , implying the accessibility of only the dimmer agns , and therefore only the smaller smbh masses ; ( 2 ) the quiescent galaxies need a relatively large smbh mass to allow the probing of the gravitational sphere of influence , whether by stellar dynamics or gas kinematics .",
    "the combination of these requirements gives rise to the observed distribution , in spite of the probable span of both galaxy types over the entire range of smbh masses .",
    "as many of the forefront studies of agns are examining correlations between smbh masses and properties of the agn host galaxies , a uniform analysis methodology is important for minimizing systematic offsets between datasets .",
    "time lags , calculated from the published light curves , were used in conjunction with rms velocity widths for optical hydrogen emission lines to estimate the reverberation masses for ngc  3227 , ngc  3516 , and ngc  4593 .",
    "these masses , listed in table [ tab4 ] , can now be added to the compilation of @xcite , as they were calculated in the same manner .",
    "in addition , these masses , when combined with published data on the host galaxy spheroid velocity dispersions , strengthen the claim that reverberation masses are accurate measures of the true smbh mass .",
