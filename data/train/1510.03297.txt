    "one of the fundamental issues of string theory is its spacetime symmetry structure .",
    "it has long been believed that string theory consists of huge hidden symmetries .",
    "this is strongly suggested by the uv finiteness of quantum string theory , which contains no free parameter and an infinite number of states . on the other hand ,",
    "the high energy , fixed angle behavior of string scattering amplitudes was known to be very soft exponential fall - off , while that of a local quantum field theory was power law . presumably , it is these huge hidden symmetries which soften the uv structure of quantum string theory . in a local quantum field theory ,",
    "a symmetry principle was postulated , which can be used to determine the interaction of the theory . in string theory , on the contrary",
    ", it is the interaction , prescribed by the very tight quantum consistency conditions due to the extendedness of string , which determines the form of the symmetry .",
    "historically , the first key progress to understand symmetry of string theory was to study , instead of low energy field theory limit , the high energy , fixed angle behavior of hard string scattering ( hss ) amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this was motivated by the spontaneously broken symmetries in gauge field theories which were hidden at low energy , but became evident in the high energy behavior of the theory .",
    "there were two main conjectures of gross s @xcite pioneer work in 1988 on this subject .",
    "the first one was the existence of an infinite number of linear relations among the scattering amplitudes of different string states that were valid order by order in string perturbation theory at high energies , fixed angle regime or gross regime ( gr ) .",
    "the second was that this symmetry was so powerful as to determine the scattering amplitudes of all the infinite number of string states in terms of a single dilaton ( tachyon for the case of open string ) scattering amplitudes .",
    "however , the symmetry charges of his proposed stringy symmetries were not understood and the proportionality constants or ratios among scattering amplitudes of different string states were not calculated .    the second key to uncover the fundamental symmetry of",
    "string theory was zero norm states ( zns ) in the old covariant first quantized ( ocfq ) string spectrum .",
    "it was proposed that @xcite spacetime symmetry charges of string theory originate from an infinite number of zns with arbitrary high spin in the spectrum . in the context of @xmath3-model approach of string theory ,",
    "one turns on background fields on the worldsheet energy momentum tensor @xmath4 .",
    "conformal invariance of the worldsheet then requires , in addition to @xmath5 , cancellation of various @xmath6-number anomalies and results to equations of motion of the background fields @xcite .",
    "it was then shown that @xcite for each _ spacetime _ zns , one can systematically construct a _ worldsheet _",
    "@xmath7 primary field @xmath8 such that@xmath9 is satisfied to some order of weak field approximation in the @xmath3-model background fields @xmath10 function calculation . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath11 is the worldsheet energy momentum tensor with background fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the new energy momentum tensor with new background fields @xmath14 .",
    "thus for each zns one can construct a spacetime symmetry transformation for string background fields .",
    "in addition to the positive norm physical propagating states , there are two types of physical zns in the old covariant first quantized open bosonic string spectrum : @xcite@xmath15@xmath16 while type i states have zero - norm at any spacetime dimension , type ii states have zero - norm _ only _ at @xmath5 .",
    "for example , among other stringy symmetries , an inter - particle symmetry transformation for two propagating states at mass level @xmath17 of open bosonic string can be generated @xcite @xmath18}=9\\partial_{\\lbrack\\mu}\\theta_{\\nu]}^{2 } , \\label{01}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 which are the on - shell conditions of the @xmath20 vector zns with polarization @xmath21 @xcite @xmath22}-6\\theta_{\\mu } ^{2}\\alpha_{-3}^{\\mu}]\\left\\vert 0,k\\right\\rangle , \\text { \\ } k\\cdot\\theta ^{2}=0 , \\label{02}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 and @xmath24}$ ] are the background fields of the symmetric spin - three and antisymmetric spin - two propagating states respectively .    in the even higher mass levels , @xmath25 for example ,",
    "a new phenomenon begins to show up .",
    "there are ambiguities in defining positive - norm spin - two and scalar states due to the existence of zns in the same young representations @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the degenerate spin two and scalar positive - norm states can be gauged to the higher rank fields , the symmetric spin four @xmath26 and mixed - symmetric spin three @xmath27 in the first order weak field approximation .",
    "in fact , for instance , it can be shown @xcite that the scattering amplitude involving the positive - norm spin - two state can be expressed in terms of those of spin - four and mixed - symmetric spin - three states due to the existence of a _ degenerate _ type i and a type ii spin - two zns .",
    "this stringy phenomenon seems to persist to higher mass levels .",
    "this calculation is consistent with the result in the hss limit .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that in the hss limit all the scattering amplitudes of leading order in energy at each fixed mass level can be expressed in terms of that of the leading trajectory string state with transverse polarizations on the scattering plane .",
    "see eq.([03 ] ) , eq.([055 ] ) and eq.([04 ] ) below .",
    "one can also justify this decoupling by wsft to be discussed in section i.d .",
    "finally one expects this decoupling to persist even if one includes the higher order corrections in weak field approximation , as there will be even stronger relations between background fields order by order through iteration .",
    "the calculation of eq.([01 ] ) was done in the first order weak field approximation but valid to all energies or all orders in @xmath28 .",
    "a second order weak field calculation implies an even more interesting spontaneously broken inter - mass level symmetry in string theory @xcite .",
    "some implication of the corresponding stringy ward identity on the scattering amplitudes were discussed in @xcite and will be presented in eq.([d22 ] ) .",
    "it was then realized that @xcite the symmetry in eq.([01 ] ) can be reproduced from gauge transformation of witten string field theory ( wsft ) @xcite after imposing the no ghost conditions .",
    "it is important to note that this stringy symmetry exists only for @xmath5 thanks to type ii zns in the ocfq string spectrum , which is zero norm only when @xmath5 .",
    "incidentally , it was well known in @xmath29 string theory that the operator products of the discrete positive norm states @xmath30 form a @xmath31 algebra @xcite @xmath32 this is in parallel with the work of ref @xcite where the ground ring structure of ghost number zero operators was identified in the brst quantization .",
    "interestingly , a set of discrete zns @xmath33 with polyakov momenta can be constructed ( see eq.([3.11 . ] ) in section iii.a.2 ) and were also shown @xcite to carry the spacetime @xmath34 symmetry @xcite charges of @xmath29 string theory @xcite@xmath35 the calculation above can be generalized to @xmath29 superstring theory @xcite .    one can also use zns to calculate spacetime symmetries of string on compact backgrounds .",
    "the existence of soliton zns at some moduli points was shown to be responsible for the enhanced kac - moody symmetry of closed string theory . as a simple example",
    ", for the case of @xmath36 bosonic closed string compactified on a @xmath37-dimensional torus @xmath38 , it was found that massless zns ( including soliton zns ) form a representation of enhanced kac - moody @xmath39 @xmath40 symmetry at the moduli point ( see section iv.a.2)@xmath41 where @xmath42 is a @xmath37-dimensional lattice with a basis @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the antisymmetric tensor @xmath45 . in this calculation one",
    "has four moduli parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47with @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , an infinite number of massive soliton zns at any higher massive level of the spectrum were constructed in @xcite .",
    "presumably , these massive soliton zns are responsible for enhanced stringy symmetries of the theory .    for the case of open string compactification , unlike the closed string case discussed above",
    ", it was found that @xcite the soliton zns exist only at massive levels .",
    "these chan - paton soliton zns correspond to the existence of enhanced massive stringy symmetries with transformation parameters containing both einstein and yang - mills indices in the case of heterotic string @xcite . in the t - dual picture , these symmetries exist only at some discrete values of compactified radii when @xmath49 @xmath50-branes are coincident @xcite .",
    "all the above results which are valid to all energies will constitute the part i of this review paper . on the other hand , in part ii of this review , we will show that the high energy limit of the discrete zns @xmath33 in @xmath29 string theory constructed in eq.([2d2 ] ) in part i approaches @xmath51 in eq.([2d1 ] ) and thus form a high energy @xmath31 symmetry of @xmath29 string .",
    "this result strongly suggests that the linear relations obtained from decoupling of zns in @xmath36 string theory are indeed related to the hidden symmetry also for the @xmath36 string theory .    in part ii of this paper , we will review high energy , fixed angle calculations of hss amplitudes .",
    "the high energy , fixed angle ward identities derived from the decoupling of zns in the hss limit , which combines the previous two key ideas of probing stringy symmetry , were used to explicitly prove gross s two conjectures @xcite .",
    "an infinite number of linear relations among high energy scattering amplitudes of different string states were derived .",
    "remarkably , these linear relations were just good enough to fix the proportionality constants or ratios among high energy scattering amplitudes of different string states algebraically at each fixed mass level .",
    "the first example calculated was the ratios among hss amplitudes at mass level @xmath17 @xcite ( see the definition of polarizations @xmath52 and @xmath53 after eq.([214 ] ) below ) @xmath54}=8:1:-1:-1 \\label{03}\\ ] ] which corresponds to stringy symmetries in the @xmath3-model calculation discussed from eq.([bzns ] ) to eq.([02 ] ) .",

    "i zns , there is one symmetric spin two tensor , one vector and one scalar zns .",
    "in addition , there is only one vector type ii zns .",

    "however , it was found that @xcite there were new hss amplitudes for the superstring case .",
    "the existence of these new high energy scattering amplitudes of string states with polarizations orthogonal to the scattering plane is due to the worldsheet fermion exchange in the correlation functions .",
    "these worldsheet fermion exchanges do not exist in the bosonic string correlation functions and is , presumably , related to the high energy massive spacetime fermionic scattering amplitudes in the r - sector of the theory .",
    "obviously , these new high energy amplitudes create complications for a full understanding of stringy symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , the claim that there is only one independent high energy scattering amplitude at each fixed mass level of the string spectrum persists in the case of superstring theory , at least , for the ns sector of the theory @xcite .",
    "incidentally , it was important to discover @xcite that the result of saddle - point calculation in refs @xcite was inconsistent with high energy stringy ward identities of zns calculation in refs @xcite .",
    "one simple example was the missing of two of the four amplitudes in eq.([03 ] ) as has been pointed out previously .",

    "indeed , it was found @xcite that saddle point calculation in @xcite is only valid for the tachyon amplitude . in general , the results calculated in @xcite gives the right energy exponent in the scattering amplitudes , but not the energy power factors in front of the exponential for the cases of the _ excited string states_. these energy power factors are subleading terms ignored in @xcite but they are crucial if one wants to get the linear relations among high energy scattering amplitudes conjectured by gross .",
    "interestingly , the inconsistency of the saddle point calculation discussed above for the excited string states was also pointed out by the authors of @xcite .",
    "the source of disagreement in their so - called group theoretic approach of stringy symmetries stems from the proper choice of local coordinates for the worldsheet saddle points to describe the behavior of the excited string states at high energy limit .",
    "it seems that both the zns calculation and the calculation based on group theoretic approach agree with tachyon amplitudes obtained in @xcite ( ignore the possible phase factors in the amplitudes to be discussed in the next few paragraphs ) , but disagree with amplitudes for other excited string states .",
    "the next interesting issues were the calculation of _ closed _ string scattering amplitudes and their symmetries in the hss limit @xcite .",
    "historically , the open string four tachyon amplitude in the hss limit was first calculated in the original paper of veneziano in 1968 . on the other hand , the @xmath127-loop closed hss amplitudes were calculated by the saddle - point method in @xcite in 1988 .",
    "both open and closed hss amplitudes exhibit the very soft exponential fall - off behaviors in contrast to the power law behavior of the scattering amplitudes of quantum field theory .",
    "however , an inconsistency arises if one plugs , for example , the tree level four tachyon open and closed string hss amplitudes  calculated by these authors , into the klt relation ( 1986)@xmath128 which is valid for _ all _ kinematic regimes and for _ all _ string states .",
    "this is due to the phase factor @xmath129 in the above equation which was missing in the closed string saddle - point calculation in @xcite .",
    "one clue to see the origin of this inconsistency is to note that the saddle - point @xmath130 identified for the open string calculation in eq.([saddle ] ) is in the regime @xmath131 .",

    "<S> we discovered infinite linear relations among fixed angle string amplitudes conjectured by gross in 1988 from decoupling of high energy zero - norm states ( zns ) , and infinite recurrence relations among regge string amplitudes from kummer function @xmath0 and appell function @xmath1 . in the gr / rr regime </S>",
    "<S> , all high energy string amplitudes can be solved by these linear / recurrence relations so that all gr / rr string amplitudes can be expressed in terms of one single gr / rr string amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we found an interesting link between string amplitudes of the two regimes , and discovered that at each mass level the ratios among fixed angle amplitudes can be extracted from regge string scattering amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> this result enables us to argue that the known @xmath2 dynamical symmetry of the appell function @xmath1 is crucial to probe high energy spacetime symmetry of string theory .    </S>",
