    "the tight - binding ( tb ) approach to electronic structure is one of the most used methods in solid state systems@xcite .",
    "the empirical tight - binding ( etb ) method , which dates back to the work of slater and koster , assumes mostly two - center approximation and the matrix elements of the hamiltonian between orthogonal and atom - centered orbitals @xcite are treated as parameters fitted to experiment or first - principles calculations .",
    "etb is widely employed to the description of electronic structure of complex systems @xcite like interfaces and defects in crystals , amorphous materials , nanoclusters , and quantum dots because it is computationally efficient ( up to 3 order of magnitude faster than the _ ab intio _ density functional methods ) and provides physically transparent results .",
    "many calculations consider just the nearest - neighbor hamiltonian with fewer parameters but with additional orbitals introduced @xcite . to consider a higher accuracy ,",
    "the range of the hamiltonian is extended to few nearest - neighbor shells ( up to the first three shells ) and , therefore more fitting parameters @xcite .",
    "however the use of a non - orthogonal formalism might scale back the range of the hamiltonian having the additional fitting from the overlap matrix .",
    "in some instances @xcite , when strain is present , non - orthogonality is invoked implicitly to accommodate the changes of the on - site energies due to local displacements in addition to the well known scaling of the transfer integrals @xcite .",
    "a non - orthogonal formalism has also a less obvious advantage . because they have a longer range than the atomic orbitals , the orthogonalized orbitals samples the local environment , making them better suited for transferability to complex systems @xcite .",
    "calculation of optical spectra in the etb formalism requires the knowledge of additional parameters : the momentum or velocity matrix elements between initial and final states . in the early work ,",
    "momentum matrix elements were considered as extra parameters fitted to the experimental or first - principles calculated dielectric function .",
    "however , etb has been extended to include the interaction with electromagnetic fields @xcite by making the substitution @xmath0 , such that dielectric function and other optical properties can be calculated without additional parameters .",
    "the scheme is based on the peierls substitution of hamiltonian matrix elements @xcite allowing us to calculate directly the momentum or velocity matrix elements . in ref . and it is shown that the substitution @xmath1 leads to the neglect of the intra - atomic momentum matrix elements or , equivalently , the coordinate operator is diagonal in the subsequent basis as we will indicate below .",
    "however , the peierls - tight - binding ( i.e. zero intra - atomic position parameters ) has been successfully used in ref . .",
    "@xcite introduced an additional momentum matrix element to accommodate the intra - atomic transitions .",
    "in contrast , boykin and vogl @xcite showed that adding intra - atomic terms suppresses the gauge invariance . to circumvent this problem b.a .",
    "foreman @xcite used group theory arguments to construct the basis in which intra - atomic matrix elements are present and the lattice gauge theory to define the interaction of electromagnetic fields with electrons in crystals .",
    "the effect of orbital overlapping on electronic structure has been studied for simple systems @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the optical matrix elements in the presence of non - orthogonal ( overlapping ) orbitals . as far as we know",
    ", no study has been done in this direction .",
    "we show that intra - atomic contributions of the coordinate operator are induced simply by the orthogonalization process .",
    "the orthogonalization process induces terms equivalent with more distant interactions , such that it gives formal justification for the nearest - neighbor spin - orbit interaction introduced in ref . for tb model with spin - orbit interaction@xcite .",
    "the analysis of simple systems shows that the non - orthogonal orbitals play an important role on optical matrix elements .",
    "we re - analyze the example of pedersen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to show that the non - orthogonal orbitals improve the optical matrix elements . in the case of graphene ,",
    "the overlap and tb parameterization are crucial in explaining the experimental data .",
    "moreover , similar arguments can be employed in the _ ab - initio _ tb - lmto ( tight binding linear muffin - tin orbitals ) method @xcite , leading to faster calculations of optical matrix elements in a parameter free theory .",
    "to fix ideas we consider a localized basis @xmath2 , where _ @xmath3 _ is the orbital type and @xmath4 is the center of the orbital ( lwdin orbitals)@xcite .",
    "the crystal hamiltonian @xmath5 is diagonalized within the bloch sums of the localized basis    @xmath6    as follows    @xmath7    with    @xmath8    the kinematic momentum operator involved in optical transitions is defined as    @xmath9.\\ ] ]    in the crystal momentum representation @xcite , the kinematic momentum operator is    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the hamiltonian in the crystal momentum representation .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) holds in a complete basis as well as in an incomplete basis .",
    "however , in an incomplete basis the momentum operator _",
    "p _ and coordinate operator _",
    "r _ do not satisfy the canonical commutation relations leading to different formula for effective masses and peierls - coupling formula involving the vector potential .",
    "these issues are detailed in refs . and . the coordinate operator _",
    "r _ is considered to have the following matrix elements in the localized basis @xmath12    @xmath13    since the overlapping of the orbitals belonging to different atoms is supposed to be small . here @xmath14 is the intra - atomic matrix element . in the usual tight - binding theory",
    "the coordinate operator is diagonal @xcite .",
    "therefore the intra - atomic parts are neglected @xcite leading to no need of other fitting parameters beyond those of the hamiltonian and to gauge invariance .",
    "pedersen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out that there are cases in which the neglect of the intra - atomic part may conduct to the underestimation of the momentum operator arguing that by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1])-  ( [ eq:4 ] ) ,    @xmath15    the neglect of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) reproduces eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) . therefore in the tight - binding basis , which is finite , by using eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) one is neglecting the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) or the intra - atomic part@xcite .",
    "this shortcoming happens because the momentum and position operators do not satisfy the canonical commutation relations in a finite basis @xcite .",
    "one way to add intra - atomic terms is the construction of b. a. foreman @xcite .",
    "however , intra - atomic terms can be induced if one considers a non - orthogonal basis . to show this ,",
    "let us have an atomic basis with non - zero overlapping    @xmath16    the orthogonal basis corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) is ( the lwdin procedure )    @xmath17    in the new orthogonal basis an operator transforms according to    @xmath18    formally , expanding eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) in power series of @xmath19 we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) as    @xmath20    the inverse transform of eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) has the following expansion    @xmath21    now suppose that in the lwdin basis the intra - atomic matrix element @xmath14 is zero , such that the hamiltonian fulfils the gauge invariance conditions .",
    "in the original non - orthogonal ( atomic ) basis , however there are intra - atomic elements .",
    "these can be easily seen if one applies the inverse transform eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) ( fig .  [ fig:1]a ) .",
    "thus in the atomic basis , up to the second order in @xmath19 , the intra - atomic matrix element is    @xmath22    eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) shows us that in the atomic basis the intra - atomic matrix elements of coordinate operator are non - zero .",
    "hence , considering the overlap , intra - atomic optical transitions can be incorporated . although the intra - atomic corrections are second order in the overlap @xmath19 , the overall corrections to the optical matrix elements are first order in @xmath19 . in the same time",
    "the range of the hamiltonian has been increased by applying the transformation given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) to the hamiltonian matrix ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b ) .",
    "this result suggests that although a nearest - neighbor hamiltonian might give a good reproducibility of the electronic structure , it completely misses the intra - atomic terms of optical matrix elements .",
    "the relationship between the overlap and longer ranged hamiltonians is able to explain the nearest - neighbor spin - orbit interaction introduced in ref . in order to reproduce the dresselhaus terms in zinc blend structures",
    "thus , the spin orbit contribution to the optical matrix elements , @xmath23 , is non - zero . in the same time",
    "the initial prescription given by chadi @xcite is preserved .",
    "the overlap and long - range hamiltonians are also closely interrelated in quantum wire transport . using nearest - neighbor hamiltonians ,",
    "the overlap is crucial in explaining anti - resonances in quantum wires @xcite .",
    "however the same anti - resonances are reproduced with a hamiltonian in which the effect of overlapping has been transferred to the second nearest - neighbor hoping elements@xcite .        in a recent paper @xcite it",
    "is shown that a piece - wise constant coordinate operator ( and therefore diagonal ) in ab - initio tb - lmto ( tight binding linear muffin - tin orbitals ) methods is analogous to the coordinate operator in semi - empirical methods . the most localized representation ( tb representation ) , where the hamiltonian is short - ranged , is not the best for calculations although it is advantageous for numerical treatments .",
    "on the contrary , the coordinate operator was considered diagonal in the ( nearly ) orthogonal representation ( with a long - ranged hamiltonian ) and used in transport calculations .",
    "the results were in very good agreement with the experimental values and with the results with the exact evaluation of the coordinate operator .",
    "thus non - orthogonality plays an important role not only in empirical models but also in first - principles methods .",
    "if one assumes that the coordinate operator is piecewise constant and that the assumption is good enough , the calculations of the optical matrix elements can be obtained faster from electron band calculations . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) , the _ k_-derivative of the hamiltonian is calculated by fast fourier transformations .",
    "thus it is more computationally efficient than the usual scheme presented in ref .",
    "however , the applicability of a piecewise constant coordinate to optical properties of various physical systems remains to be investigated .",
