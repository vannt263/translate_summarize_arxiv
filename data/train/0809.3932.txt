    "hybrid inflation  @xcite , along with its supersymmetric realizations  @xcite , remains one of the most predictive models of inflation .",
    "in such a scenario , inflation terminates at some critical point when a so called waterfall field acquires a vacuum expectation value  ( vev ) , thereby ending inflation .",
    "recently , a new supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model was proposed  @xcite , which realizes @xmath2-term hybrid inflation and includes a subdominant non - anomalous fayet - iliopoulos @xmath3-term that arises from a u(1 ) gauge symmetry of the inflation waterfall sector .",
    "it has therefore been called the @xmath0-term model of hybrid inflation .",
    "the @xmath0-term model can naturally accommodate the currently favoured red - tilted spectrum , along with the actual value of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations , and the required number of @xmath4-folds .",
    "the @xmath0-term model is defined through the superpotential @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gauge - singlet inflaton superfield and @xmath7 is a chiral multiplet pair of the so - called waterfall fields which have opposite charges under the u(1)@xmath8 gauge group , i.e.  @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , @xmath10 indicates the mssm superpotential without the @xmath1-term .",
    "the model lagrangian is supplemented by soft susy breaking terms , which contribute to the scalar potential , leading to an inflaton vev naturally of @xmath11  ( tev ) .",
    "constraints on the model can be derived from cosmological inflation through the number of @xmath4-folds and the power spectrum and spectral index of curvature perturbations  @xcite .",
    "this implies the upper limit @xmath12 for an inflaton sector with a minimal ( next - to - minimal ) khler potential  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the fayet - iliopoulos term in the @xmath0-term model is necessary to approximately break a discrete symmetry in the waterfall sector .",
    "the late decays of the gut - scale waterfall particles produce an enormous entropy that can reduce the gravitino abundance below the limits imposed by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , providing a viable solution to the gravitino overabundance problem  @xcite .    in the @xmath0-term model the @xmath1-parameter of the mssm",
    "can be generated effectively when the scalar inflaton receives a non - zero vev , @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the inflaton vev will also produce an effective majorana mass matrix as well , @xmath14 . as a consequence",
    ", the resulting heavy majorana neutrinos are expected to have masses of order @xmath1 .",
    "a possible explanation of the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe may be obtained by thermal electroweak - scale resonant leptogenesis  @xcite .    in this report",
    "@xcite , which summarizes the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we focus on the properties of the lightest right - handed sneutrino ( lrhs ) and identify favourable regions of the parameter space within msugra , for which it becomes a viable candidate for thermal dark matter .",
    "ignoring the terms proportional to the small neutrino - yukawa couplings , the @xmath15 right - handed sneutrino mass matrix @xmath16 is given in the weak basis @xmath17 by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 . neglecting the possible flavor structure contained in the soft susy - breaking sneutrino mass matrix @xmath21 and trilinear coupling matrix @xmath22 , the sneutrino spectrum will consist of 3 light ( 3 heavy ) right - handed sneutrinos with masses @xmath23 all mass terms in ( [ eq : sneutrinomasses ] ) are @xmath241000 )  gev , so a proper choice of model parameters can accommodate a lightest right - handed sneutrino to act as lsp . unless the trilinear coupling @xmath22 is small compared to @xmath1 , the off - diagonal elements in ( [ eq : sneutrinomassmatrix ] ) will induce a sizeable mixing between the heavy and light right - handed sneutrino states , suppressing the light masses to values smaller than @xmath25 .     parameter space for @xmath26  gev , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the black contours show the predicted lrhs mass , while a sneutrino @xmath30/neutralino @xmath31/stau @xmath32 lsp is present in the blue / green / orange area .",
    "the red area is excluded by direct susy mass searches .",
    "the white contour is defined by the condition @xmath33.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in figure  [ fig : scans ] we plot the lhrs mass @xmath34 as contours in the msugra parameter plane ( @xmath35 ) , for @xmath28 , @xmath26  gev and @xmath27 . for the inflaton couplings",
    "@xmath36 we simply choose @xmath29 , in accordance with the bounds derived from inflation .",
    "the connection between the lrhs mass @xmath30 and @xmath1 generally points towards a low - energy susy spectrum .",
    "this coincidentally includes the @xmath37-boson funnel region , where @xmath38 .",
    "very large and small values for @xmath39 and @xmath40 are disfavoured as they exclude a sneutrino lsp .",
    "these correlations may be somewhat relaxed if non - universal inflaton couplings @xmath41 and @xmath42 are considered .",
    "as was first observed in  @xcite , there exists a new quartic coupling between right - handed sneutrinos and higgs fields in the @xmath0-term model described by the lagrangian @xmath43 resulting from the @xmath2-term of the inflaton field .",
    "this leads to several channels of sneutrino annihilation into higgses , gauge bosons and fermions via the direct quartic coupling as well as @xmath44-channel higgs and @xmath45-channel sneutrino exchange once one of the higgs fields in eq .",
    "[ llsp ] acquires a vev  @xcite .",
    "the most effective annihilation process is @xmath46 production in the lightest higgs boson resonance , @xmath47 . in order to compute the sneutrino relic density remaining after the sneutrino freezes out of thermal equilibrium and to analyze the constraints on the effective annihilation coupling @xmath48",
    ", we adopt the msugra scenario @xmath49 while keeping the lrhs mass as a free parameter .",
    "the effective annihilation coupling @xmath48 , eq .",
    "[ llsp ] , is then calculated so as to obtain a sneutrino relic density @xmath50 , consistent with observations .",
    "numerical estimates of the allowed parameters in the @xmath51-plane are shown in figure  [ fig : cdm ] . in order to account for the observed dm relic abundance in the @xmath37-boson funnel region , where @xmath52",
    ", the effective coupling @xmath48 should be @xmath53 this has to be compared with the upper limit derived from successful inflation  @xcite , @xmath54 for a minimal ( next - to - minimal ) khler potential . in general , we find that lrhs masses larger than about 100  gev are not possible within a msugra realization of the @xmath0-term model .",
    "this is indicated by the value of the neutralino mass in the given msugra scenario as displayed by vertical line in figure  [ fig : cdm ] .     as a function of the lrhs mass @xmath34 for a relic density @xmath55 ( blue curve ) in the msugra scenario , eq .",
    "[ scenii ] . the actual sneutrino and neutralino masses in the scenario",
    "are indicated by vertical lines .",
    "the red curves denote the upper bound on @xmath48 as obtained by the cdms - ii experiment and as expected by the projected sensitivities of supercdms and xenon1t.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    further constraints on the @xmath51-plane may be obtained by taking into account the limits from direct searches of experiments which look for scattering between weakly interacting massive particles and nuclei .",
    "upper limits on @xmath48 are derived by comparing the calculated elastic cross section between the sneutrino lsp and the nucleon with the current bound on the spin - independent nucleon cross section from the cdms - ii experiment and the expected sensitivities of the supercdms extension  @xcite and the xenon1 t experiment  @xcite .",
    "these limits are included in figure  [ fig : cdm ] .",
    "the current bound already excludes large parts of the @xmath51-parameter plane .",
    "the upgraded experiment supercdms and the proposed xenon1 t experiment will cover most of the parameter space , but will leave open the lightest higgs - boson pole region which is theoretically favoured by inflation within the msugra framework .",
    "in this report we discussed the possibility of a right - handed sneutrino lsp as candidate for dark matter in the supersymmetric @xmath0-term model of hybrid inflation . by virtue of a new quartic coupling with the higgs fields the sneutrino @xmath56 can efficiently annihilate via the lightest higgs - boson resonance @xmath37 into pairs of @xmath57-quarks , in the kinematic region @xmath58 , and so drastically reduce its relic density to the observed value @xmath59 .",
    "it might seem that to obtain this particular relation between the masses of the @xmath37 boson and @xmath56 , a severe tuning of the model parameters is required .",
    "however , it is worth stressing here that such a mass relation may easily be achieved within a msugra framework of the @xmath0-term model that successfully realizes hybrid inflation .",
    "relatively large couplings are required for the sneutrino dm scenario , that could make higgs bosons decay invisibly , e.g.  @xmath60 .",
    "also , right - handed sneutrinos could be present in the cascade decays of the heavier supersymmetric particles .",
    "the @xmath0-term hybrid inflationary model therefore gives rise to rich phenomenology which can be probed at high - energy colliders  @xcite , as well as in low - energy experiments of lepton flavour and number violation  @xcite .",
