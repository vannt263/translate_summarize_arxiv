    "recent advances in direct imaging techniques have led to the discovery of planets in moderately wide ( @xmath110100au ) orbits around other stars , such as formalhaut @xcite , hr  8799 @xcite , and @xmath5  pic @xcite .",
    "direct imaging surveys have also discovered planetary - mass ( @xmath613 ) companions with very large ( @xmath1200500au ) orbital radii including 1rxs  j1609@xmath32105b ( 8 , 330au ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and gsc  06214@xmath300210b ( 14 , 330au ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most extreme of such wide companions is wd  0608 - 661b with a mass of 7  and a projected separation of 2500au @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to determine whether a planetary - mass companion at such a large distance formed from a protoplanetary disk ( and thus should be considered a planet ) or as a binary system ( and should be called a brown dwarf ) .",
    "regardless of their origins , detailed spectroscopic and photometric analysis of these directly imaged systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can yield insight into the properties ( e.g. luminosity , temperature and mass ) of gas - giant planets , and thereby shed light on the over 500 radial velocity and transiting exoplanets that lie within a few au of their host stars and therefore can not be directly studied .",
    "determining the mass function , separation distribution , and frequency of these wide planetary - mass companions will provide insight into their formation .",
    "the precise boundary between planets and brown dwarfs is still under debate .",
    "the most widely used definition adopts the deuterium - burning limit of @xmath013  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to set the boundary .",
    "alternatively , the mass distribution of substellar companions might provide a means to distinguish planets from brown dwarfs , by shedding light on their formation process(es ) .",
    "the mass function of companions to solar - type stars has two distinct populations separated by a deficit of objects around @xmath130  ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ; a.k.a .",
    "the `` brown dwarf desert '' ) , suggesting that the population of objects with masses below this gap might have a common origin and thus all be considered planets .",
    "similarily , the distribution of separations might provide valuable clues .",
    "if wide substellar companions form like binary stars , we expect that they may reside at separations as large as @xmath11000  au from their primary star , as stellar binaries are observed at such large separations .",
    "such companions would represent the extreme low - mass end of binary star formation @xcite .",
    "therefore we would expect that their separation distribution would be similar to that for stars and brown dwarfs @xcite such that their distribution would be logarithmically flat ( i.e. companion masses are equally likely in @xmath7(separation ) ) .",
    "if instead wide substellar companions form like planets , we do not expect to find them beyond a few hundred au , because protoplanetary disks should not form planets so far out .",
    "@xcite find that even planet formation in moderately wide orbits ( 35100au ) , such as in the case of hr  8799 , could not have formed via core accretion .",
    "whether or not the competing disk - instability model @xcite can form planets at such large separations has not been well explored .",
    "disks have only been modeled to moderate radii ( 300au ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the typical sizes of circumstellar disks range from @xmath1100400au @xcite , making in situ formation by disk - instability at very wide separations , where there is no disk at all , unlikely .",
    "substellar and planetary - mass companions are expected to cool and fade quickly after their formation and therefore are most readily detected in young ( @xmath610myr ) star - formation regions .",
    "we have used the ukidss galactic cluster survey ( gcs ) and the pan - starrs  1 ( ps1 ) 3@xmath8  survey to search for wide planetary - mass companions in the upper sco association .",
    "a similar search has previously been conducted with 2mass @xcite , but the 2mass detection limit ( @xmath9=14.3 ; @xmath120  in upper sco ) is @xmath14mag brighter than for ukidss ( @xmath9=18.2 ; @xmath15  in upper sco ) .",
    "combining both optical ( ps1 ) and nir ( ukidss ) data increases the wavelength coverage , significantly improving the ability to reject reddened background stars as potential planetary - mass companions . in section  [ sec : data ] we discuss the ukidss gcs and the ps1 photometric data . in section  [ sec : searchmethod ] we describe our search method and how we photometrically determine the spectral type of our candidates . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we describe the spectroscopic followup and our new substellar and a low - mass stellar companions .",
    "our dicussion is in section  [ sec : discussion ] and our conclusions are in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the united kingdom infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) began in 2005 and uses the 3.8 m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) located on mauna kea @xcite .",
    "the ukidss project is defined in @xcite .",
    "ukidss uses the ukirt wide field camera ( wfcam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a photometric system described in @xcite . the pipeline processing and science archive are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "ukidss consists of five surveys : the galactic clusters survey ( gcs ) , the large area survey ( las ) , the galactic plane survey ( gps ) , the ultra - deep survey ( uds ) and the deep extragalactic survey ( dxs ) .",
    "the gcs covers @xmath01400deg@xmath10 of galactic star - formation regions and open clusters visible from the northern hemisphere ( @xmath11@xmath12@xmath330@xmath13 ) , including the upper sco star - forming region , in 5 nir bands , @xmath14 ( @xmath00.8@xmath32.4@xmath15 m ) @xcite .",

    "in addition , we use data from the other ukidss surveys ( las , uds , and dxs ) to construct stellar spectral energy ( sed ) templates of known dwarfs in order to estimate the spectral type of our candidates . see section  [ sec : sed_chi2 ] , section  [ sec : sed_chi22 ] , and appendix  [ appendix : sed_templates ] for more details .    for both our wide companion search and ultracool dwarf template construction",
    ", we use the catalog data from the ukidss dr9 release . also , all ukidss magnitudes are on the vega system",
    ". we chose good data as having the following properties : magnitude errors @xmath210.2mag , not deblended and without saturated , almost - saturated or bad pixels .",
    "these requirements remove most of the spurious detections we may encounter near bright stars . furthermore , we ignore all detections @xmath221  from the location of our primary star because they likely correspond either to the actual primary star or small artifacts within the star s point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we note that our completeness within 3  from the primary star is still very low because any companion would be likely to be contaminated by the relatively brighter primary star s psf .",
    "pan - starrs  1 ( ps1 ) is a 1.8 m , wide - field telescope located on haleakal on the island of maui , conducting a multi - wavelength , multi - epoch , optical imaging survey @xcite . its large sky coverage ( @xmath030,000deg@xmath10 ) coupled with its @xmath23  ( @xmath24=866 ) and @xmath25  ( @xmath24=962 )",
    "filters provide both coverage of the same star - forming regions as ukidss and greater sensitivity at longer wavelengths , where brown dwarf and young gas giant planet spectra are brighter compared to the shorter wavelengths .",
    "our work is the first to use ps1 data to search for young brown dwarfs and planetary - mass companions .",
    "we use data from the ps1 3@xmath8  survey , which began in 2010 , both to search for candidate companions and to construct spectral energy distribution templates of ultracool dwarfs ( see section  [ sec : sed_chi2 ] , section  [ sec : sed_chi22 ] , and appendix  [ appendix : sed_templates ] ) .",
    "the 3@xmath8survey covers @xmath075@xmath26 of the sky in 5 optical filters , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath23 , and @xmath25  @xcite . at each epoch a single field is exposed for 43s in @xmath27 , 40s in @xmath28 , 45s in @xmath29 , 30s in @xmath23 , and 30s in @xmath25 .",
    "the photometry from the reduced multi - epoch data have been averaged to calculate mean magnitudes .",
    "the predicted final limiting magnitudes , on the ab system , for each filter are 23.4 , 22.8 , 22.2 , 21.6 , and 20.1mag in @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath23 , and @xmath25 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we chose good quality data according to the photometric quality flags set in the ps1 desktop virtual observatory ( dvo ) database @xcite .",
    "we queried the dvo catalogs for 3@xmath8  survey and selected objects with the following attributes : fits a psf model ( is not extended ) ; is not saturated ; has a good sky measurement ; is not likely a cosmic ray , a diffraction spike , a ghost or a glint ; does not lie between the image chips ; and has the quality flag psf_qf@xmath300.9 to ensure that at least 90% of the object is unmasked .",
    "furthermore , we require objects to be detected at least twice in a single night in at least one of the five filters to remove potential spurious sources that would only appear as single detections .",
    "finally , we require that a single bandpass measurement error be @xmath210.2mag in order to use that bandpass .",
    "we note that we obtained photometry from the ps1 database prior to the updated photometric calibrations @xcite .",
    "because the previous database had misreported some photometric errors as below 0.01mag , we have capped the reported photometric error at 0.01mag .",
    "all ps1 photometry tabulated is from the previous database , for consistency with our actual search and analysis .",
    "we combined the ukidss gcs and ps1 3@xmath8  catalogs to search for objects located within 1@xmath330  of known upper sco members using topcat @xcite .",
    "bona fide members are taken from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite compiles these lists for all members determined prior to the paper .",
    "our final input list includes 673 spectroscopically confirmed upper sco members .    the decreased detection efficiency within 3  limits our search to companions with projected separations greater than @xmath1400au .",
    "furthermore , the ukidss @xmath9-band sensitivity can detect companions down to @xmath15 , assuming an age of 510myr for upper sco @xcite .",
    "our initial candidate selection used nir colors to isolate candidates that lie along the upper sco color - magnitude sequence .",
    "this significantly reduces the obvious background objects with neutral colors .",
    "we then selected substellar candidates using ukidss @xmath20 and @xmath9 photometry , which are nearly complete for upper sco .",
    "our candidates were selected to lie above a diagonal line which roughly traces the cluster sequence and to be fainter than @xmath20=12 ( @xmath190 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all companions brighter than this limit should have been detected by @xcite .",
    "we empirically defined this line by horizontally shifting the evolutionary model tracks until they bracketed the edge of the observed primary star sequence ( figure  [ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "these initial color - selected candidates were then fit using our sed template library to estimate their spectral type .",
    "see appendix  [ appendix : sed_templates ] for a description of our sed templates .",
    "we performed a @xmath31 minimization to determine the spectral type using the available ps1 and ukidss photometry for each of our candidates .",
    "our @xmath31 minimization took into account uncertainties in both the candidate data and the templates using the following weight , @xmath32 for each filter , @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the magnitude error in the candidate data and @xmath36 is the magnitude error in the sed template .",
    "we set the magnitude error in the sed templates to a constant value of 0.1mag in order to prevent the sed template with the largest uncertainties ( i.e. those constructed by averaging open cluster or upper sco members ) from returning the minimum @xmath37 .",
    "this was an issue because the individual photometric uncertainties are @xmath10.01mag , whereas the photometric scatter within each spectral type in either the open clusters or upper sco is around 0.5mag .",
    "then we calculated the distance modulus of each candidate relative to _ each _ sed template , @xmath38 , by minimizing the @xmath31 for the distance : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the sed template , @xmath33 is the filter , @xmath41 is the observed magnitude in a filter , @xmath42 is the magnitude of the sed template , @xmath43 is the total number of filters , and @xmath44 is the weight , from the previous equation .    since the sed templates can have a different number of filters , we determined the reduced @xmath37 between the candidate data and templates in order to compare the goodness of fit between different templates .",
    "we also required that each template have ukidss photometry because our initial color selection of candidates is done in the nir .",
    "therefore , our final @xmath37 fitting matched the candidate data with all of the sed templates with any nir photometry and measurements in at least three filters in common .",
    "we then determined the relative distance modulus to each of these sed templates ( equation  [ eqn : dm ] ) and the associated reduced @xmath37 .",
    "finally , the best fit sed was chosen based on the minimum reduced @xmath31 . the absolute magnitude to spectral type relations ( see appendix  [ appendix : sed_templates ] ) convert the relative distance modulus determined in our @xmath37 fitting to an absolute scale .",
    "there is an uncertainty in the spectral type estimates from the sed fitting due to both the intrinsic scatter in the seds of field objects of a given spectral type and the measurement uncertainties in both the candidate data and the sed templates . to incorporate this uncertainty in our final distance estimate",
    ", we carried out a monte carlo simulation to find the distribution of best - fit templates .",
    "for each candidate , we perturbed the photometry in each filter by drawing from a gaussian distribution corresponding to the magnitude errors .",
    "we varied the sed template photometry in the same manner .",
    "for each realization ( out of a total of 5000 ) , we recomputed the best - fit distance and spectral type , resulting in a distribution of best fit spectral type and distance .",
    "we generated 5000 iterations , because the median distance and spectral type from the ensemble of fits converged for a tested set of objects with a variety of measurement errors in @xmath25 .",
    "the final best fit spectral type is the median from the monte carlo simulation and the best fit template is the most probable template ( according to the monte carlo distribution ) with that spectral type .",
    "note that the sed fitting routine may select different seds with the same spectral type .",
    "therefore , a spectral type uncertainty of zero only means that the object had best fitting sed templates with the same spectral type , not necessarily a single sed template . in these cases",
    "we adopted a spectral type uncertainty according to the available templates , usually approximately one spectral subclass .",
    "furthermore , the spectral type estimates are quantized and thus we only have a total of 34 possible spectral types .",
    "for our purposes , the spectral type uncertainty simply serves to further distinguish the quality of the template fit and an object s candidacy .",
    "we selected the final candidates combining the reduced @xmath37 ( @xmath45@xmath46@xmath225 ) and spectral type cut ( @xmath47m7 ) from the sed fitting , a visual check on the ukidss and/or ps1 images , and their observability with irtf spex according to their magnitude ( @xmath19@xmath618 ) .",
    "although the sed template fitting routine efficiently removes many of the reddened background stars that pass the initial nir color selection , some still may pass .",
    "our criteria will miss objects without at least three - band photometry , but it gives us a relatively pure candidate sample for followup spectroscopy in comparison to a solely color - selected one .",
    "we started with a total of 285 color - selected candidates .",
    "there were a total of 30 candidates remaining after the sed fitting for spectral type and our @xmath37 cut .",
    "in principle proper motions could confirm candidates as comoving .",
    "however the predicted uncertainty in the ukidss proper motions is only @xmath113masyr@xmath48 .",
    "this precision is insufficient for upper sco because of its very low proper motion ( @xmath49,@xmath50 = @xmath310,@xmath325masyr@xmath48 ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we require spectroscopy to confirm our candidates as true companions .",
    "we obtained spectroscopic followup using spex @xcite , a medium - resolution , near - ir spectrograph ( 0.82.5@xmath15 m ) on the 3-meter nasa infrared telescope fascility ( irtf ) on mauna kea . the low resolution",
    "( lowres15 ) prism mode with a 0.8  slit ( r@xmath51@xmath52@xmath0100 ) is well - suited to spectroscopic confirmation of our substellar companions which are expected to have spectral types of late - m to mid - l . even at this low resolution",
    ", the spectra of substellar companions will have broad water band and molecular features that distinguish them from background stars .",
    "we can also easily distinguish a triangular @xmath20-band continuum , a feature which is characteristic of young low - mass objects @xcite .",
    "we observed a total of 6 candidates on 2011 june 19 - 22 ( ut ) in cloudy conditions with average seeing ( @xmath10.8 ) . on 2012 july 5 we observed one candidate in poor seeing ( @xmath11.5 ) . on july 7 - 8",
    "we observed another 7 candidates in excellent seeing ( @xmath10.5 ) . on 2013",
    "april 16 we reobserved two companions to obtain higher signal - to - noise spectra .",
    "each observation used the standard abba nod pattern for sky subtraction .",
    "we observed an a0v standard star following each candidate ( with the exception of a few shared standards for nearby targets ) then took wavelength and flatfield calibrations immediately afterward .",
    "we reduced the data using version 3.4 of the spextool package @xcite .",
    "table  [ table : tab1 ] tabulates the observation details .",
    "the spectral resolution ( r@xmath0100 ) is too low to determine the spectral type using gravity / age independent flux indices @xcite .",
    "instead we first fit each spectrum to the a collection of ultracool dwarf spectra in the irtf / spex spex prism library .",
    "the adopted spectral type for our candidates is that of the best fitting object .",
    "we adopt a spectral type uncertainty of half a spectral subclass ( e.g. m9@xmath20.5 ) which encompasses both the uncertainty in the spectral type of the spex prism library objects and cases where the candidate may fit to more than one object .",
    "in addition , we compared our candidates to optical m and l  dwarf standards observed with irtf / spex also in prism mode , a common method to determine spectral type in the nir ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these m  dwarf standards are from the spectral classification scheme of @xcite and the l  dwarf standards of @xcite .",
    "l  dwarf nir spectral sequence in low resolution ( r@xmath0100 ) is characterized by water absorption at 1.4@xmath15 m and 1.8@xmath15 m .",
    "thus the @xmath20-band and @xmath9-band slopes change with spectral type .",
    "comparisons with the m ",
    "l  dwarf optical standards yield the same spectral type as comparisons with both the spex prism library and young m  dwarfs , although there are discrepancies due to the youth of our companions . figure  [ fig : f2 ]",
    "compares each of our companions with the m and l  dwarf standards .",
    "finally , we compared our candidates to young m  dwarfs from @xcite with spectral types straddling our candidates best fit spectral type from the prism library comparison . for each candidate ,",
    "the best fitting young m  dwarf is clearly the best match compared to the other young m  dwarfs with a spectral type difference of just half a subclass .",
    "therefore our adopted spectral type uncertainty of half a subclass is consistent .",
    "the final spectral type is that of the best matching young m  dwarf .",
    "our new companions have spectral types of m9 , m9 , m8.5 , m7.5 , and m5.5 .",
    "we tabulate their properties in table  [ table : tab2 ] .",
    "we calculated both the effective temperatures ( @xmath53 ) and the bolometric magnitudes ( @xmath54 ) of our companion discoveries and their primaries using empirical relationships from the literature .",
    "we adopted a spectral type uncertainty of half a subclass for all primary stars , except in the case of hip77900 where we assumed an uncertainty of one subclass .",
    "for all objects we performed a monte carlo simulation to derive the physical properties and their 68@xmath55 percentile confidence limits .",

    "our methods to calculate @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and mass are slightly different depending on the spectral type of the object .    for objects with spectral type @xmath30m5 , we determined @xmath53 from the observed spectral type using the young m  dwarf scale of @xcite .",
    "we note that the @xcite scale is tailored for young stars and brown dwarfs , like our companions . for comparison",
    ", we also converted spectral type to @xmath53 using the @xcite relationship for old field dwarfs with spectral types later than m6 ( with an uncertainty of 124k ) .",

    "<S> we have also confirmed a low - mass stellar companion , usco1610@xmath32502b ( 730au , m5.5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our substellar companions appear both non - coeval with their primary stars according to evolutionary models and , as a group , are systematically more luminous than the upper sco cluster sequence . </S>",
    "<S> one possible reason for these luminosity discrepancies could be different formation processes or accretion histories for these objects . </S>"
