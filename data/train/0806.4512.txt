    "the quantum mechanical effects originating in coherent tunneling of cooper pairs in small josephson junctions ( jj ) have been investigated actively in recent years due to their great potential to be used in nanotechnological applications in the future  @xcite .",
    "a central obstacle has been that the effects are easily decohered by an uncontrolled coupling between the studied system and its nearby environment  @xcite .",
    "however , due to their high sensitivity to the environmental fluctuations , the small jjs can as well be used as probes of physics in mesoscopic low temperature devices  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study theoretically how decoherence appears in the @xmath0 characteristics of a voltage - biased single - cooper - pair transistor  @xcite ( scpt ) .",
    "the noise in the source - drain line of the scpt is dominated by quantum mechanical fluctuations of voltage due to finite transmission line impedance , or more generally due to coupling to the electromagnetic environment  @xcite ( ee ) .",
    "the noise in the gate ( charge ) is due to spurious charge fluctuators  @xcite ( cf ) in the materials surrounding the island , as the ee noise in this line is usually shielded by a small gate capacitance .",
    "these decoherence sources are accompanied by quasiparticle tunneling across the jjs , where a single electron tunnels across a jj with the cost of breaking a cooper pair . in this work we model the scpt s transport properties to the second order in the interaction with the relevant unperturbed baths describing ee , cf and quasiparticles .",
    "this leads to the demand that the resistance associated with the ee and cf has to be small ( @xmath3 ) and that the tunneling resistances of the jjs have to be large ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we study the @xmath0 characteristics in the subgap regime where resonant tunneling of cooper pairs is the essential conduction mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the average current in this regime has been previously calculated by using the pauli master equation  @xcite modeling the populations of the scpt s eigenstates .",
    "we call this treatment as the coherent tunneling model ( ctm ) . practically every tunneling event of one or more cooper pairs across the jjs in the scpt can be made resonant by properly adjusting the transport and gate voltages .",
    "it follows that the ctm - current has quite cumbersome features as the subgap region is full of peaks with alternating heights and widths .",
    "experimentally , however , the first - order ( single particle ) resonances are well visible  @xcite but only few of the higher - order ( several particle ) resonances have been identified  @xcite .",
    "this kind of `` wash - out '' of the higher - order resonances occurs apparently due to strong decoherence caused by the environment as compared to the widths of the resonances .",
    "the results obtained by the ctm are valid only for the strongest resonances and therefore only qualitative match between this theory and experiments can be obtained .",
    "we model the system using a density matrix approach ( dma ) based on a keldysh type real - time diagrammatic technique  @xcite in the born approximation ( leading order ) .",
    "as compared to the ctm , the method takes into account also nondiagonal contributions in the master equation .",
    "this enables zeno - like effects  @xcite in the charge transport , where strong decoherence drives , or continuously `` measures '' , the scpt into superpositions of eigenstates that are more stable under the decoherence . in ref .",
    "[ ] this was used to analyze the experimental findings of ref .",
    "[ ] for a double - island system using the ee as the relevant source of decoherence . also the charge tunneling nearby the so - called jqp - cycles has widely been analyzed by similar methods  @xcite considering quasiparticle tunneling as a perturbation .",
    "this paper extends these results in the sense that the method applies to arbitrary resonances and includes all the relevant noise sources in the voltage - biased scpt .",
    "we show by numerical simulations that in typical experimental conditions most of the higher - order resonances are indeed lost , unless a careful filtering of the relevant noise is done .",
    "we also show that the ohmic environments ( ee and cf ) leave different traces to the @xmath0 characteristics so that one can , in principle , identify the strength of ee and cf separately in a specific experimental setup . in the case of asymmetric scpt and strong dissipation , the model produces the results of ref .",

    "one sees that if @xmath25 is an eigenstate with an eigenenergy @xmath26 , then the translated state @xmath27 is also an eigenstate with an eigenenergy @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",

    "the product state basis @xmath30 is the most convenient one for a numerical solution in the case @xmath31  @xcite .",

    "the preceding treatment is valid when no quasiparticle tunneling exists , or its effect can be neglected . in the opposite case the quantization of the tunneled charge @xmath6 must be changed from @xmath15 to @xmath53 .",
    "we treat the quasiparticle tunneling perturbatively causing transitions between unperturbed states ( section [ qparticles ] ) .",
    "since the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath54 describes only cooper - pair - tunneling processes , its eigenstates are superpositions of states differing @xmath55 in the tunneled charges , where @xmath37 is an arbitrary integer . in other words",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is a sum of four blocks each operating in a subspace possessing a different parity combination ( even or odd ) of the tunneled charges @xmath56 .",

    "also certain effective nonvanishing value of @xmath91 could be used for describing dephasing due to thermal fluctuations of the cf . however , in this case the model would not be `` universal '' since an ensemble of harmonic oscillators produces different kind of thermal noise as , for example , an ensemble of two - level systems . in the description the island charge @xmath19 is identified as @xmath92 of the cf .",

    "( [ dis ] ) starts to increase also .",
    "so qualitatively speaking , in the exact product - state calculation the current should stop after some time the decoupling is made , in order to conserve the energy .",
    "also the transition rates due to ( higher - order ) processes that include large changes in the feed charge should be suspicious since the bath does not `` follow '' the state of the system .",
    "this is clearly not what happens in a real physical situation .",
    "the effects following from the assumption of a static ee restricts the usage of the real - time diagrammatic technique for this problem .    the extra imaginary term in eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] ) , dependent on @xmath332 , is not a constant and induces ( small ) spurious dynamics .",
    "this indicates that the effective potential felt by the subsystem in this treatment is not exactly @xmath333 .",
    "however , in the formal solution of heisenberg equations of motion the embedding of the bath ( change in the effective potential ) vanishes exactly  @xcite . in the second - order calculation",
    "the term @xmath332 does not contribute in the diagonal terms , as the complex part vanishes , and the contribution through nondiagonal terms is small .",
    "still diagrams that posses terms like @xmath334 , which depend on the `` position '' in the w - s ladder are a source of small translational variance , but their effect seems to be small as long as @xmath335 .",
    "the effect can be studied by shifting the central zone .    in the fourth - order calculation",
    "the previous change in the effective potential and the translational variance seem to enhance each other .",
    "this occurs because after each integration the corresponding rn diagrams do not remove the embedding of the ee completely but leave behind the discussed extra term .",
    "this is then enhanced by terms like @xmath334 , which can exist two times in diagrams that describe decay , producing strong translational variance and dissipation , which is essentially larger than in the first - order calculation .",
    "also nondiagonal elements suffer from the same effect .",
    "if one now removes the corresponding spurious terms after each integration from the calculation `` by hand '' , the discussed behaviour vanishes and the final correction is small compared to the first order calculation , as expected for @xmath336 .",
    "so for analysing the effect of the ee in the case of larger @xmath57 , where the higher order effects should become dominating , the model can not be used in this form ."
