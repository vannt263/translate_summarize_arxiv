    "the coupling constants @xmath13 , @xmath15 , and @xmath32 , entering in eqs .  ( [ eq2s],[eq3s ] ) , can be expressed in terms of a two - body potential and single - particle wave functions  @xcite .",

    "the energy of the state with two fermions occupying the same orbital is @xmath13 .",

    "in contrast @xmath168 scales to zero at low energies for @xmath106 .",

    "in fact , bosonization is only needed to capture the influence of @xmath94 and @xmath95 terms close to @xmath171 .",
    "away of that region , for @xmath106 , one just needs to retain @xmath98 and @xmath101 terms , and borrow known results from the frustrated @xmath77 spin-@xmath24 chain .",

    "the coordinate wave - function must have a node when the positions of the two fermions coincide .",
    "hence , for the spin - triplet state the contact @xmath178-wave interaction does not play any role .",
    "this is reflected in eqs .",

    "<S> [ lattices](b ) we place two fermions per well , both in @xmath30 orbitals , then for @xmath116 due to the hund s coupling a total @xmath117 state will be formed in each well , and the haldane phase of a spin-@xmath118 chain will be realized .    in conclusion , dipolar fermions on zig - zag lattices can capture relevant spin - orbital models of realistic @xmath0-electron systems and allow to explore parameter regimes which are hardly accessible for solid - state compounds . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the quantum nature of orbital fluctuations can be revived , which combined with geometric frustration and spin dynamics produces an intriguing rich ground state phase diagram .    </S>",
