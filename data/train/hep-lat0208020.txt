    "it is well known that both the 3d ising model @xmath0 and the 3d lattice regularized @xmath1 theory @xmath2 undergo a second order phase transition at @xmath3 from a phase where the z(2 ) symmetry is broken ( @xmath4 ) to a phase when the z(2 ) symmetry is restored ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the order parameter of this transition is the expectation value of the fundamental field , i.e. the magnetization .",
    "the spectrum of massive excitations in the broken symmetry phase of 3d ising model and @xmath1 theory can be determined from the analysis of wall - wall correlations of spin operators . by performing monte carlo simulations near @xmath6 ,",
    "it has been possible to detect three @xmath7 states  @xcite .",
    "results for their mass ratios agree in the two models : @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the fundamental mass ) .",
    "since the 3d ising model and the 3d ( lattice ) @xmath1 theory belong to the same universality class , this result shows that universality is valid far beyond critical indices .",
    "the first excitation ( @xmath11 ) is below the two particle production threshold , it represents therefore a non - perturbative state , identified as a bound state of the fundamental excitation  @xcite .",
    "the second mass state ( @xmath12 ) could be a fictitious one which mimics the two - particle cut .    according to _ duality _",
    ", the broken phase of the 3d ising model can be put in correspondence with the confined phase of the 3d z(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "this implies that mass ratios in the glueball spectrum in the confined phase of 3d z(2 ) gauge theory should agree with mass ratios in the broken phase of 3d ( spin ) ising model .",
    "this has been verified in ref .",
    "@xcite using monte carlo results  @xcite for the @xmath7 glueball masses in the 3d z(2 ) gauge theory : @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "according to _ universality _ , the broken phase of 3d ising model corresponds to the deconfined phase of the ( 3 + 1)d su(2 ) pure gauge theory at finite temperature  @xcite , with the magnetization of the spin model mapped into the polyakov loop , @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that the same mass ratios observed in the broken phase of 3d ising should appear in the spectrum of the slopes of the exponential decays of wall - wall correlations of polyakov loop operators , i.e. in the spectrum of _ screening masses _ , in the deconfined phase of ( 3 + 1)d su(2 ) at finite temperature near criticality . in this work we present a numerical test of this prediction",
    "a naive way to determine @xmath7 screening masses is to study the connected wall - wall correlation function @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the wall - average of polyakov loops , @xmath20 is the lowest mass in the @xmath7 channel , @xmath21 the first excited level in the @xmath7 channel and the dots represent the contribution from higher mass excitations and from multi - particle cuts . since @xmath22 in the high temperature phase , in principle also a @xmath23-independent term in @xmath24 of the form @xmath25 $ ] should be included ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , such term is evidently sub - dominant for @xmath26 , as we expect to be the case here .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations using the overheat - bath updating algorithm  @xcite with kennedy - pendleton improvement  @xcite .",
    "we studied the naive wall - wall correlation at @xmath27 on a @xmath28 lattice ( statistics 1 m ) and at @xmath29 on a @xmath30 ( statistics 1.5 m ) .",
    "these values of @xmath31 are slightly above the critical value @xmath32 determined in ref .",
    "we determined the effective mass defined as @xmath33 and found in both cases that data for @xmath34 as a function of @xmath23 reach a plateau value corresponding to the fundamental mass : @xmath35 at @xmath27 and @xmath36 at @xmath29 .",
    "the deviations from the plateau at the smallest values of @xmath23 can be attributed to lattice artifacts and to the possible effect of other physical states . in order to single out the latter effect , we rescaled the values of @xmath34 and @xmath23 by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , and put together on the same plot data from @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ scaling ] , data from the two different @xmath31 s fall on the same curve _ before _ reaching the plateau , indicating the physical origin of these effects .      in order to detect this excited state",
    ", we adopted the so - called `` variational '' method  @xcite .",
    "the method includes the following steps : define a basis of ( wall - averaged ) operators @xmath39 , compute the connected cross - correlation matrix among them @xmath40 diagonalize @xmath41 to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath42 and finally extract the masses @xmath43 . in practical simulations",
    "not more than two ( sometimes three ) leading eigenvalues allow to extract a signal .",
    "the effectiveness of the method relies on the choice of a `` good '' set of operators ; it is convenient to define operators living on different length scales ( for instance , by use of recursive definitions ) .",
    "moreover , by defining operators with non - trivial transformation under spatial rotation , it is possible to look for states with non - zero angular momentum .    as a first set of operators we considered the one which can be built adapting to the present case the recursive procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath44 @xmath45\\;,\\ ] ] @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we considered a set of six such ( wall - averaged ) operators corresponding to the smoothing steps 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 and 15 .",
    "the effective masses extracted by the variational method applied to these set of operators are shown in fig .",
    "[ 0 + ] which shows a clear plateau at a value @xmath49 , in agreement with the naive determination of the fundamental mass .",
    "data coming from the next - to - leading eigenvalue and corresponding to the first excited level are quite noisy . nevertheless ,",
    "if we take as `` plateau '' value the first value of the effective mass which agrees at 1@xmath50 level with the preceding and the following value , we get @xmath51 and a mass ratio @xmath52 in good agreement with the prediction from universality .",
    "further analysis has shown that this excited state is coupled with the operators with larger scale in the set we considered . indeed , taking into account only two operators ( smoothing level 0 and 15 )",
    "the same result is obtained . instead",
    ", performing the analysis taking only the first four operators ( smoothing levels 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 ) gives @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with a mass ratio @xmath55 which is compatible with the value of @xmath56 in the 3d ising model and could be the analog of the two - particle cut in the same model .      finally , in order to look for states with non - zero momentum , we considered the following set of @xmath57 operators , inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath58\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath59 .",
    "the variational method gave for the fundamental @xmath57 mass the value @xmath60 .",
    "the ratio of this value to the fundamental mass in the @xmath7 channel ( from the naive determination ) @xmath61 gives @xmath62 .",
    "this result can be compared with the corresponding mass ratio in the glueball spectrum of the 3d gauge ising model which , by duality , is connected to the spectrum of massive excitations in the broken phase of the 3d ( spin ) ising model . in the 3d gauge model we have @xmath63 and @xmath64 , so our result for the lowest screening mass in the @xmath57 channel seems to be in agreement with the first excited mass @xmath65 , more than with the fundamental @xmath66 ."
