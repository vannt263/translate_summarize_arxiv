    "manifesting themselves as a sudden ( seconds ) increase in the x - ray luminosity and reaching levels that can be many times brighter than the persistent ( accretion ) luminosity , typical bursts emit about @xmath6 ergs , last seconds to minutes , and have light curves that are well described by a fast - rise exponential - decay profile .",
    "their spectra are generally consistent with a blackbody temperature @xmath73  kev , where @xmath8 increases until the burst peak , and then decreases exponentially .",

    "the occurrence of a superburst in the transient ns - lmxb 4u  1608522 after 55 days of low ( @xmath13% eddington ) accretion rate has challenged superburst theory , as it is difficult to explain carbon ignition at the observed depths when the ns surface is still cool @xcite , i.e. , when accretion has not yet been able to `` warm up '' the ns . the superburst candidate in terzan 5 is even more challenging for theoretical models , as the ns is very cool @xcite and the superburst onset was coincident with a period of only low - level accretion , or no accretion at all .",

    "the fact that we find simultaneous excesses in the maxi and the swift / bat data is suggestive of a real increase of flux before the flare ; however , given the lack of further information we decided to take these detections only as marginally significant given the systematic errors and possible background issues which we are unable to account for .",
    "the last rxte / pca observation was performed on november 19th , 2011 , after which the source was not visible anymore due to visibility constraints .",

    "the flare is at @xmath22 ( d/5.5 kpc)@xmath23 ergs s@xmath5 , the flare peak was probably brighter .",
    "the flare duration is about a day ; an exponential fit to the bolometric luminosity light curve gives e - folding times between 6 and 11 hr depending on the assumed onset time .",
    "exponential fits to the raw 2 - 20 kev maxi data give consistent results .",
    "integrating this exponential curve during a 1 day period gives a radiated energy in the @xmath1 ergs range .",
    "more than @xmath24% of the contribution comes from the first 5 hr . all of these values are within the ranges expected for superbursts , although this one appears to be one of the longest such bursts ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our results , together with the fact that the maxi spectra of the flare are consistent with blackbody spectra at @xmath023 kev that cool as the intensity decreases @xcite , strongly suggest that the observed x - ray flare is most probably a superburst .",
    "we note that recently @xcite reported on the spectral modeling of the same maxi data used in this work .",
    "their spectral results are binned into 5 intervals ( a - e ) of different time - lengths to improve the s / n of their energy spectra .",
    "the method used in this paper to estimate the blackbody temperature and flux is more rudimentary , but has the advantage of giving more points for fitting the thermal evolution of a superbursts ( see section  [ sec : fit ] ) . given that the values of bolometric luminosity and radiated energy @xcite obtain are consistent with ours within errors ( after correcting for the fact that they estimated the fluence in the 220 kev range , and used 8.7 kpc as the distance to terzan 5 ) , in the following sections we use the values for the bolometric luminosity as we calculated above .",
    "@xcite modeled the thermal evolution of the surface layers as they cool after a superburst onset , assuming that the fuel is burned locally and instantly .",
    "these authors showed that simultaneous modeling of superburst light curves and quenching times could be used to constrain both the thickness of the fuel layer and the energy deposited in the neutron star envelope .",
    "@xcite applied the @xcite models to the observations of several superbursts and found that their fits implied ignition column depths in the range @xmath25 g @xmath3 , energy releases on the order of @xmath26 ergs g@xmath5 , and total radiated energies on the order of @xmath27 ergs , very similar to the observed superburst characteristics .",
    "the model has four free parameters to vary : energy release @xmath28 ergs g@xmath5 , ignition column depth @xmath29 ( in units of g @xmath3 ) , burst start time , and the power - law slope of the initial temperature profile t@xmath30 . the model assumes a 1.4 @xmath31 and a 10 km radius ns .",
    "@xcite assumed that the fuel burned instantaneously `` in  place '' , giving an initial temperature profile with @xmath321/8 .",
    "instant burning implies that the rise of the burst is instantaneous .",
    "here we also explore @xmath33 , which is required to fit the rise of the superburst light curve of 4u  163653 ( this fit and its implications will be published elsewhere ) . as is usually the case in the spectral analysis of type - i x - ray bursts , it is possible that the tail of the superburst can be contaminated by the accretion disk . to understand the possible contribution",
    ", we fit all superburst data as well as data from the first 0.5 days ( 12 and 6 independent points , respectively ) .",
    "we assumed a distance of @xmath34  kpc and allowed the superburst start time to vary between 0 and 5800 seconds before the first data point .",
    "to model the superburst lightcurve we used a markov chain monte carlo method with 30,000 samples .",
    "although we find that @xmath29 is well constrained to @xmath35 ( including errors in the distance ) , our fits failed to constrain the start time and @xmath36 .",
    "this is due to the fact that our data does not sample the initial rise of the superburst : as explained by @xcite , during the first part of the superburst the energy released from the surface is mainly sensitive to @xmath36 and insensitive to @xmath29 .",
    "however , as the superburst evolves , the characteristics of the cooling tail mainly depend on @xmath29 . in the upper and lower panel of figure  [ fig : sim ]",
    "we show representative fits to the first 6 data points of the superburst for different @xmath36 and @xmath29 , assuming that the first maxi observation occurred 1000 or 4000 seconds after the superburst ignition , respectively .    for a 1000 s start time ( upper panel )",
    ", our data sample the first hour of the superburst and therefore the model allows only a narrow range of @xmath36 .",
    "the column depth is not as well constrained when using 6 points ( but it is when using 12 points ) . for a start time of 4000",
    "s ( bottom panel ) , however , the first data point becomes part of the cooling tail .",
    "this means that the early part of the lightcurve can be very bright , @xmath36 becomes poorly constrained while @xmath29 is well - constrained when using both 6 and 12 points . in figure  [ fig : sim1 ] we show the relation between @xmath36 and @xmath29 ( @xmath33 )",
    ". left and right panels are for fits to the first 6 and 12 superburst data points , respectively .",
    "we note that a larger distance than that assumed in this paper would imply that the data points of the superburst move to higher luminosity .",
    "this requires a larger energy release to increase the luminosity in the early part of the superburst , and a deeper ignition depth to increase the luminosity in the cooling tail . for the largest distance estimate of 8.7 kpc",
    ", we find that the inferred energy release increases to close to @xmath37 and the column depth close to @xmath38",
    ".      our power spectral analysis does not reveal major features . in the first observation of the outburst ( mjd 55860.2 ) we only find a @xmath39 ( single trial ) 500@xmath4020 hz qpo . in the following three observations which sample the rest of the bright part of the outburst ,",
    "the power spectra are well described by a combination of 3 zero - centered lorentzians with @xmath41 at @xmath00.002 , @xmath01 and @xmath015 hz .",

    "the @xmath42 sec duration of the pre phase in the superburst observed in the lmxb 4u 1820 - 30 is already at the limit of what current superburst models can explain .",

    ", we did not observe the start of the superburst from exo  1745248 , resulting in large uncertainties in the superburst properties .",
    "the superburst of exo  1745248 is _ at least _ of equal duration , and twice as energetic ( table  [ table : table ] ) .",
    "the largest values of the bolometric radiated energy , @xmath43 , consistent with the observations , are close to the predicted maximum radiated energy for a superburst set by neutrino emission ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the decay time , @xmath44 , depends on the thickness of the cooling layer , and , therefore , on the ignition column depth , @xmath29 . for 4u  1254690 the depth was determined using the instantaneous burning model , yielding a depth comparable to the larger values in the range we derive for exo  1745248 , which are also favored by our fits with the same model @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the ignition depths and decay times of the two superbursts likely have similar values .",
    "the larger @xmath43 for exo  1745248 can be explained by the burning of more carbon - rich material , which is accommodated by the larger values in the range found for the specific energy release , @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , this is the most energetic and possibly the longest superburst observed to date .",
    "most superbursting sources , including 4u  1254690 , are observed to accrete continuously at a high rate of around @xmath45 of the eddington limited rate @xmath46 ( for solar composition and a @xmath47 radius ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the high rate ensures a hot outer crust , forces unstable ignition of the carbon , and may be necessary for the production of a mixture of carbon and heavy isotopes that is thought to be the fuel for superbursts ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "both sufficient heat and carbon are required for superburst ignition .",
    "this scenario was challenged by the observation of the superburst from the ns - transient 4u  1608522 , which occurred only 55 days after the onset of an accretion outburst .",
    "@xcite showed that the neutron star envelope does not heat up quickly enough to explain the ignition of runaway carbon burning . in the past year",
    "three more superbursts have been detected from transient sources , including the one discussed in this paper ( for the other detections see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even if we assume that exo  1745248 started accreting at an increased rate 0.5 days or even a few days before the superburst ( but at levels undetected by maxi and swift / bat",
    ") , the time is much too short for the envelope at the derived ignition depths to heat up from either thermonuclear burning in the envelope or from nuclear processes in the inner crust .",
    "therefore , sufficient heat must have been generated at the superburst ignition depth within this short time interval .",
    "currently there is no known process that could provide this .",
    "the case for a substantial additional heat source in the outer crust ( close to the superburst ignition depth ) has also been made from observations of crustal cooling after outbursts in long - duration transients @xcite .",
    "the 0.5 days time scale that we find , however , puts strong constraints on the immediacy with which this heating process must take place .",
    "but where does the carbon - fuel necessary for a superburst come from ?",
    "hydrogen - accreting superbursters display a high ratio of the persistent fluence between two ( type - i x - ray ) bursts to the burst fluence @xcite , indicating that apart from during type - i x - ray bursts , a substantial fraction of the accreted hydrogen and helium burns in a stable manner .",
    "this is thought to be a required process to produce the carbon fuel for superbursters @xcite , and it is observed to occur close to an accretion rate of @xmath48 , i.e. , the rate inferred for most superbursters . during the outburst in 2000 ,",
    "exo  1745248 accreted at a comparable rate of on average @xmath49 for two months @xcite , during which there were bursts as well as periods without bursts .",
    "in fact , because the quiescent luminosity is over a factor @xmath50 lower ( @xmath51 in quiescence is @xmath52 erg s@xmath5 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , effectively all of the superburst fuel must have been created in such short outbursts .",
    "this conclusion is still valid even if we consider that at the above level of quiescent emission , exo  1745248 s luminosity might vary by a factor of a few on timescales of hours - years ( which may indicate that the accretion does not fully switch off in quiescence , but continues at a very low rates , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "during the outburst in 2000 , about @xmath53 of the inferred @xmath54 was accreted .",
    "using the shortest suggested outburst recurrence time of @xmath55 @xcite , a superburst recurrence time of @xmath56 is inferred , but it may very well be longer ( unless the outburst recurrence time is shorter , which would translate in shorter superburst recurrence times ) .",
    "because of the low average luminosity , the neutron star is relatively cool , which reduced the carbon burning rate at the bottom of the accreted pile to allow for sufficient carbon to remain to trigger a thermonuclear runaway after such a long recurrence time .    of course , we can not exclude the possibility that the superburst ignition conditions had been almost reached during the previous outburst , such that only a short accretion episode of a few days was required to set it off .",
    "although not impossible , we find it improbable as the outer crust is expected to have reached a higher temperature by heating during the two - month outburst in 2000 ( i.e. conditions more favorable for ignition ) , than after a few days in 2011 .",
    "a more plausible scenario could be that the carbon - fuel necessary for a superburst was created mostly during outburst , and then concentrated during the long period of quiescence , as after accretion ceases , there is time for the light and heavy elements to separate out from each other ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an additional potentially important process is chemical separation by freezing at the interface of the ocean and the outer crust ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "after the previous outburst there was plenty of time for carbon to separate out from iron and heavier isotopes , and so substantially increasing the carbon fraction at the bottom of the accreted column . if this scenario is correct , then it is possible to explain the @xmath29 necessary in cases where superburst ignition occurs at early times of the outburst .",
    "however , it could be problematic for models , as pure carbon layers have a higher thermal conductivity and will remain colder than an impure carbon layers ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; moreover , upwards transport of carbon could make it harder for the carbon to reach ignition depth . in any case",
    ", still unexplained is how the neutron star temperature can rise so quickly at the start of the outburst to be able to ignite the superburst .",
    "the difficulties faced by superburst models that invoke carbon ignition may point to a different fuel for superbursts . in the analysis of bursts from the likely ultra compact x - ray binary 4u  0614 + 091 ,",
    "@xcite pointed out that in principle helium ignition could explain many of the observed column depths of superbursts .",
    "this would require accumulation of a deep and cold layer of helium on the star .",
    "further theoretical work on this scenario is needed , but the fact that the superburst from exo 1745248 appears to have one of the largest ignition column depths of known superbursts may place it too deep for helium ignition .    *",

    "<S> we report on chandra , rxte , swift / bat and maxi observations of a @xmath01 day x - ray flare and subsequent outburst of a transient x - ray source observed in october  </S>",
    "<S> november 2011 in the globular cluster terzan  5 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the source is the same as the transient that was active in 2000 , i.e. , the neutron star low - mass x - ray binary exo  1745248 . for the x - ray flare </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a 611 hr exponential decay time and a radiated energy of @xmath1 erg . </S>",
    "<S> these properties , together with strong evidence of decreasing blackbody temperature during the flare decay , are fully consistent with what is expected for a thermonuclear superburst . </S>",
    "<S> we use the most recent superburst models and estimate an ignition column depth of @xmath2 g @xmath3 and an energy release between @xmath4 erg g@xmath5 , also consistent with expected superburst values . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude therefore that the flare was most probably a superburst . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss our results in the context of theoretical models and find that even when assuming a few days of low level accretion before the superburst onset ( which is more than what is suggested by the data ) , the observations of this superburst are very challenging for current superburst ignition models .    </S>",
