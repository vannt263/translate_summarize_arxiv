    "it is evident , that not any geometry can be axiomatized .",

    "it means that a part @xmath13 of all propositions @xmath12 of geometry @xmath5 may be obtained as a result of logical reasonings of propositions @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the set of axioms @xmath9 .",

    "it is supposed that the set @xmath15 of remaining propositions of geometry @xmath5 can not be deduced from the set @xmath11 of axioms .",
    "the godel s theorem proves the same , but godel starts from the supposition , that the complete axiomatization of geometry is possible , and he deduced essentially that the complete axiomatization is not always possible .",
    "the real problem of the geometry construction lies in the fact , that we know no other method of the geometry construction except for the deduction of the geometry propositions from the geometry axioms .",
    "euclid had deduced his euclidean geometry from the system of axioms .",
    "it was proved @xcite , that the euclidean axioms are compatible between themselves , and the proper euclidean geometry is a consistent geometry .",
    "mathematicians try to repeat the euclidean experience for construction of other ( non - uniform ) geometries .",
    "they use the euclidean method of the geometry construction . as a result",
    "one can not be sure that one deduces the full geometry , but not only its part .",
    "we start from the general supposition that the complete axiomatization of a geometry is not always possible . in this case",
    "the result of the godel s theorem is evident .",
    "however , to adduce such a supposition , one is to have an alternative method of the geometry construction , because a formal consideration of the set of the geometrical propositions is not constructive without a method of these propositions obtaining .",
    "in reality there is an alternative method of the geometry construction .",
    "it is based on two statements .    1 .",
    "geometry is described completely by its metric ( distance between any two points of the space ) .",
    "2 .   the proper euclidean geometry is a true geometry , which can be described completely by its metric .",
    "we shall refer to geometry , which is completely described by its metric , as the physical geometry .",
    "the geometry , which is deduced from the system of some axioms , will be referred to as an axiomatic geometry , or a mathematical geometry .",
    "then the alternative method of the physical geometry construction is formulated as follows .    _",
    "any physical geometry is obtained from the proper euclidean geometry as a result of its deformation .",
    "_    it means that all propositions of the proper euclidean geometry are expressed via euclidean metric , and the euclidean metric in all propositions is replaced by the metric of the geometry in question .",
    "there is a theorem , which proves that all propositions of the proper euclidean geometry can be expressed via euclidean metric @xcite . as a result",
    "one obtains all propositions of the geometry in question , expressed via its metric .",
    "usually one supposes , that the term `` metric '' means the distance , satisfying the triangle axiom . in the previous presentation",
    "the term `` metric '' means the distance simply ( which is not satisfies the triangle axiom , in general ) .    to avoid a confusion ,",
    "one uses the world function @xmath16 instead of the metric @xmath17 .",
    "it is more convenient from technical point of view .",
    "besides , in the case of indefinite geometry ( for instance , in geometry of minkowski ) the world function @xmath0 is real , although @xmath18 may be imaginary .",
    "if one knows the proper euclidean geometry , the expression of the proper euclidean propositions via the euclidean world function is a purely technical problem .",
    "but there are some subtleties in this problem .",
    "the fact is that , the proper euclidean geometry has specific euclidean properties and general geometric properties .",
    "all propositions of the proper euclidean geometry are to be expressed only via general geometric properties . only in this case",
    "the expression via euclidean world function may be deformed and used in the deformed geometry .",
    "the fact is that , the specific properties of the proper euclidean geometry are different in the euclidean spaces of different dimensions .",
    "any specific property of the proper euclidean geometry contains a reference to the dimension @xmath19 of the euclidean space .",
    "the general geometric propositions of the proper euclidean geometry do not refer to the dimension @xmath19 of the euclidean space .",

    "it is to note that the proper euclidean geometry is a degenerate geometry in the sense that the same geometrical object may be described by different ways in terms of the world function .",
    "for instance , the circular cylinder @xmath51 is defined by the relation@xmath52where @xmath32 are two different points on the axis of the cylinder and @xmath22 is some point on the surface of the cylinder .",

    "the circular cylinder @xmath51 depends only on its axis @xmath56 , passing through the points @xmath32 , but not on positions of the points @xmath32 on the axis @xmath56 .",
    "the axis of the cylinder @xmath56 is described by the relation @xmath57where @xmath58 means that the vectors @xmath24 and @xmath59 are collinear ( linear dependent ) , which means mathematically , that @xmath60    thus , if the point @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , then the straight line @xmath64 in the euclidean space , but @xmath65 in the physical geometry , in general .",
    "then@xmath66 in the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "but in general,@xmath67 in other words , the circular cylinder of the proper euclidean space is split into many different cylinders after deformation of the euclidean space .",
    "a more accurate statement is as follows .",
    "cylinders @xmath68 and @xmath69 are different , in general .",
    "but in the proper euclidean geometry they may coincide , even if @xmath70 but @xmath71 .",
    "it means , that in the proper euclidean geometry different geometrical objects may coincide , because of very high symmetry of the euclidean geometry . in other words",
    ", a deformation of the euclidean geometry may violate its symmetry , and coincidence of different geometrical objects ceases .",
    "in application to the property of equivalence the multivariance property looks as follows . in general , there are many vectors @xmath25,@xmath72 which are equivalent to vector @xmath24 and are not equivalent between themselves .",
    "this situation is common for all physical geometries .",
    "however , there are possible such geometries , where the set of vectors @xmath25,@xmath72 degenerates into one vector . in the proper euclidean geometry",
    "we have such a degeneration for all vectors @xmath24 and any point @xmath33 , which is an origin of the vector @xmath25 , equivalent to the vector @xmath24 .",
    "it means that the multivariance of the equivalence property is a general property of a physical geometry , whereas single - variance of the equivalence property in the proper euclidean geometry is a specific property of the euclidean geometry , which is conditioned by the form of the euclidean world function .",
    "the multivariance is a new property of physical geometry .",
    "multivariance properties have not been yet investigated properly .",
    "multivariance of the equivalence property generates intransitivity of the vector equivalence . in other words , if @xmath24eqv@xmath25 and @xmath25eqv@xmath73 , then , in general , @xmath24 is not equivalent to @xmath73 .",
    "the intransitive equivalence is difficult for investigation .",

    "its meaning is as follows .",
    "the segment @xmath75 } $ ] of the straight between the points @xmath76 is described by the relation @xmath77 } = \\left\\ { r|f_{3}\\left ( p_{0},r , p_{1}\\right ) = 0\\right\\ }   \\label{a1.18}\\]]in general , the equation @xmath78describes some surface @xmath79 around some volume @xmath80 in the space @xmath1 .",

    "it means that it follows from the relation @xmath24eqv@xmath85 and ( [ a1.17 ] ) * , * that @xmath90 .",
    "note , that the single - variance of the two vectors equivalence takes place only for the proper riemannian geometry , when the world function is nonnegative and all terms in the relation ( [ a1.17 ] ) are real for any points @xmath91 . for the pseudo - riemannian geometry , when the world function @xmath0 may have any sign , the equivalence of two vectors is multivariant , in general , even if the vectors have a common origin .",
    "investigation shows , that the equivalence of two vectors is single - variant only in the flat proper riemannian space , i.e. in the proper euclidean space .",
    "note , that in @xcite one investigated multivariance of parallelism of two directions , the concept of the vector equivalence had not yet been introduced .",
    "however , there is a single - valued connection between the multivariance of two vectors equivalence and multivariance of the two direction parallelism .",
    "there are some special cases of the geometry and of vectors , when the equivalence property is single - variant .",
    "for instance , in the proper riemannian space , when the world function is nonnegative and the triangle axiom ( [ a1.17 ] ) takes place , equivalence of two vectors @xmath24 and @xmath92 is single - variant , provided that @xmath93 .",
    "the physical geometry , whose world function satisfies the triangle axiom ( [ a1.17 ] ) will be referred to as the @xmath0-riemannian geometry .",

    "the @xmath0-riemannian geometry is constructed by means of the deformation principle , and it is defined completely by its world function . the @xmath0-riemannian geometry may be discrete , or continuous .",
    "this circumstance is of no importance , because the construction of physical geometry by means of the deformation principle does not need introduction of a coordinate system .",
    "the @xmath19-dimensional riemannian geometry is constructed as an internal geometry of the @xmath19-dimensional smooth surface @xmath95 in @xmath96-dimensional proper euclidean space @xmath97 @xmath98 .",

    "if the world function satisfies the triangle axiom ( [ a1.17 ] ) , it determines the @xmath0-riemannian geometry uniquely . however , there is in addition the riemannian geometry which does not coincide with the @xmath197-riemannian geometry in some details .",
    "the riemannian geometry pretends to be a true geometry , describing the real space - time . at any rate ,",
    "most of contemporary mathematicians consider the riemannian geometry as a true geometry and ignore the @xmath0-riemannian geometry .",
    "we compare the @xmath0-riemannian geometry and the riemannian geometry , firstly , as logical constructions and , secondly , as possible space - time geometries .",
    "the riemannian geometry is rather special geometry .",
    "it is described only in terms of coordinates .",
    "the riemannian space is isometrically embeddable in the euclidean space of rather large dimension .",
    "the riemannian geometry uses the triangle axiom ( [ a1.17 ] ) , taken in the form ( [ a4.5 ] ) , as internal constraint of a geometry .",
    "it is internal in the sense , that some basic concepts of the riemannian geometry ( concept of a curve ) can not formulated at all without the triangle axiom .",
    "the concept of the world function is a secondary concept in the riemannian geometry .",
    "the concept of the world function , defined by the relation ( [ a4.5 ] ) , can not be formulated without a reference to the concept of a curve ( geodesic ) .",
    "it is impossible to obtain a generalization of the riemannian geometry in terms of its basic concepts .",
    "the @xmath0-riemannian geometry is a special case of the physical geometry , when the world function is restricted by the triangle axiom ( a1.17 ) .",
    "the world function is a primary concept of the @xmath0-riemannian geometry .",
    "the @xmath0-riemannian geometry is not constrained by such conditions as a use of coordinates and isometric embeddability in the euclidean space .",
    "the @xmath0-riemannian geometry does not use such non - metrical concept as the concept of a curve .",
    "the triangle axiom is an external constraint in the @xmath0-riemannian geometry in the sense , that it is not used in construction of the geometry . avoiding the triangle axiom , we obtain a more general geometry , whose concepts are constructed without a reference to the triangle axiom .",
    "the @xmath0-riemannian geometry is a more general construction than , the riemannian one in the sense , that imposing some constraints on the @xmath0-riemannian geometry , one may to obtain the riemannian geometry .",
    "for instance , in the physical geometry there are two sorts of straights @xmath198and@xmath199    the straights of the type ( [ a4.21 ] ) are single - variant ( one - dimensional ) in the @xmath0-riemannian geometry , whereas the straight of the type ( a4.22 ) are multivariant , in general .",
    "the straight of the type ( [ a4.21 ] ) is a special ( degenerate ) case of the straight ( [ a4.22 ] ) , when the point @xmath33 coincides with the point @xmath89 . in the proper euclidean geometry",
    "the straights of both types are single - variant ( one - dimensional ) .    to obtain the riemannian geometry from the @xmath0-riemannian geometry",
    ", one needs to remove the multivariant straights of the type ( [ a4.22 ] ) and to use only degenerate one - dimensional straights of the type ( [ a4.21 ] ) .",
    "thereafter the degenerate straights ( [ a4.21 ] ) are used for introduction of the concept of a geodesic .",
    "the world function is constructed as a secondary concept on the basis of the infinitesimal line element and of the geodesic .",
    "the world function is not used at the construction of the riemannian geometry .",
    "the riemannian geometry is constructed as an internal geometry of a surface in the proper euclidean space .",
    "eliminating multivariant straights ( [ a4.22 ] ) from the riemannian geometry and leaving only degenerate straights , one can not be sure that the way of riemannian geometry construction , based on a use of only degenerate straights ( geodesics ) , is consistent .",
    "a use of geodesics in the construction of geometry leads to the fact , that two - dimensional euclidean plane with a hole can not be isometrically embedded to the euclidean plane without a hole .",
    "besides , in the riemannian geometry the absolute parallelism is absent , although it takes place in the @xmath0-riemannian geometry .",
    "thus , it seems , that the riemannian geometry is only a part of the full physical geometry .",
    "the remaining part of the full geometry is cut by the constraint , that the degenerate straights ( [ a4.21 ] ) form the complete set of straights .",
    "this constraint is an internal constraint , which is used at the construction of the riemannian geometry .",
    "it can not be removed without destruction of the riemannian geometry .    in application to the space - time the @xmath0-riemannian geometry is more effective , than the riemannian geometry .",
    "the @xmath0-riemannian geometry is a more general geometry . to obtain a more general space - time geometry from the @xmath0-riemannian geometry , it sufficient only to remove the triangle axiom , which is an external constraint .",
    "we obtain immediately a space - time geometry of a general form . in the riemannian geometry",
    "the triangle axiom is an internal constraint , which is used at the construction of the riemannian geometry . removing the triangle axiom ,",
    "we lose the method of the riemannian geometry construction .    using the riemannian geometry as a space - time geometry",
    ", one can not imagine , that the space - time geometry may be responsible for quantum effects r91 .",
    "one can not imagine that the space - time geometry may be responsible for a limited divisibility of physical bodies @xcite .",
    "the unlimited divisibility , used in the riemannian space - time geometry , generates an independence of the particle dynamics on the space - time geometry . in reality",
