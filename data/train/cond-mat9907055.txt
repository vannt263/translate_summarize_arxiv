    "the dephasing of electron states in quantum dots ( qd ) was considered mainly in connection with weak localization phenomena , see experiments @xcite and theory @xcite .",
    "a different type of phenomenon in which dephasing is important is interference phenomenon in an aharonov - bohm ring @xcite . if a pinched qd is embedded in one of the arms of such a ring the transmission through this arm is supported by a resonant electron state in the qd .",
    "the dephasing of this state @xcite suppresses the interference in the ring , and this can be observed as a decrease of of the oscillating part of the ring conductance @xcite .    the dephasing is due to electron - phonon or electron - electron interactions of the qd electrons with some `` environment '' , which can either be in equilibrium or driven out of it by external forces . in the experiment @xcite",
    "the dephasing was due to the capacitive interaction of the qd with a voltage biased point contact ( pc ) , and the amount of dephasing was dependent on the bias .",
    "in a situation like this one can separate the equilibrium dephasing , which depends only on the temperature of the environment , from an additional dephasing which is due to voltages applied to the environment . the theory concerning this experiment",
    "was given in @xcite .",
    "in recent experiments @xcite the nanostructure ( ns ) , that was capacitively coupled to the qd , was a multiterminal 2deg device in a quantizing magnetic field .",
    "we present in this paper a generalization of the theory given in @xcite that takes into account the specific effects appearing due to the complicated geometry , and the chirality of the states in the ns ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "a similar problem was addressed in @xcite using a different approach , based on lumped mesoscopic circuit elements .",
    "broadening of electron transitions in self - assembled qd s due to coulomb interactions with the electrons in the wetting layer was considered in @xcite .",
    "we consider a qd with a single level @xmath0 , that is described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an operator creating an electron in the qd state .",
    "the ns is a multiterminal junction in the 2deg described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the potential confining the 2deg , @xmath5 is the vector potential of the external magnetic field @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the electron field operator .",
    "the capacitive interaction between the qd and the ns , assumed to be weak , is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electron density operator , and @xmath10 is a coulomb interaction kernel .",
    "the perturbation eq.([hint ] ) has a `` dual '' meaning .",
    "if one combines @xmath11 one can see that @xmath10 is the change of the confining potential @xmath4 due to one electron occupying the qd state ( when @xmath12 ) , while combining @xmath13 one can see that @xmath14 is the change of the energy @xmath15 due to the coulomb interaction of the electron in the qd with the electron density in the ns .",
    "at low temperatures the dephasing is due to electron - electron interactions @xcite . to calculate the dephasing rate we use the method developed in @xcite .",
    "the electron density in the ns fluctuates in time and creates a fluctuating potential in the qd which brings about fluctuations of the energy level @xmath0 .",
    "these fluctuations are given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "as a result , the correlator @xmath18 is defined by the density - density correlator @xmath19 , while @xmath20 .",
    "consider resonant transmission through the qd for electron energies @xmath21 close to @xmath0 .",
    "when the qd level does not fluctuate the transmission amplitude @xmath22 contains the breit - wigner factor @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 is the width of the level due to the qd s connection with the leads .",
    "when the level fluctuates the transmission and reflection can be elastic and inelastic . in interference experiments",
    "only the elastic transmission is of importance and to obtain the elastic transmission amplitude @xmath25 one has to replace the breit - wigner factor by @xcite @xmath26 , \\label{bwn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 one can see that @xmath28 which means dephasing of the qd state , that is responsible for resonant transmission .",
    "the same can be understood from the dynamics of the qd state amplitude @xcite , @xmath29.$ ]    the level fluctuations are characterized by their amplitude @xmath30 and by the correlation time @xmath31 .",
    "the amplitude is proportional to the strength of the capacitive coupling @xmath32 , while the correlation time is independent of @xmath32 and is determined by the correlation time of the density - density correlator .",
    "hence , for weak enough coupling , one has @xmath33 , which corresponds to dynamical narrowing . in this case @xmath34 and the integral eq.([bwn ] ) reduces to @xmath35 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath36 with the following level oscillations spectrum @xmath37 this result means that in the case of dynamical narrowing one can describe the dephasing by a dephasing time @xmath38 .",
    "the dephasing rate can be estimated as @xmath39 , and is smaller than the amplitude of the level fluctuations @xmath40 . in the general case",
    "when @xmath41 , the transmission probability @xmath42 is not a lorenzian , and a dephasing time can not be defined .      to calculate the correlator @xmath43",
    "we represent the field operator in terms of scattering states ( ss s ) @xcite ( see appendix ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an operator creating an incoming electron in channel @xmath46 of terminal @xmath47 , with energy @xmath21 . performing calculations similar to those in @xcite we find @xmath48 where the contribution from terminals @xmath47 and @xmath49 is @xmath50    [ \\delta({\\epsilon}'-{\\epsilon}-\\omega)+\\delta({\\epsilon}'-{\\epsilon}+\\omega ) ] .",

    "using eq.([ks ] ) one can find the dephasing rate as a sum over _ single terminals _ and _ pairs of terminals _",
    ", @xmath75 it follows from eq.([kod ] ) that a _ single terminal _ contributes to the dephasing only if ss s emitted from this terminal reach the interaction area , and that this is always an equilibrium contribution , @xmath76 a _ pair of terminals _ contribute to the dephasing only if ss s emitted from both terminals overlap in the interaction area , @xmath77 when both terminals are at the same voltage , the contribution of this pair to dephasing is an equilibrium one .",
    "note that @xmath78 contains the `` zero point fluctuations '' , but they do not contribute to the equilibrium dephasing rate , given by @xmath43 at @xmath79 , hence for zero temperature there is no equilibrium dephasing .",
    "if one is interested in nonequilibrium dephasing one has to look only at pairs of terminals which are at different voltages , and which send scattering states that overlap in the interaction region .",
    "the nonequilibrium contribution of such a pair is @xmath80 for zero temperature it reduces to [ gv0 ] @xmath81    using the dual property of the interaction between the qd and the ns , we consider now @xmath10 as a small variation of the confining potential @xmath4 due to an electron occupying the qd . as a result",
    "the scattering matrix of the ns is changed according to eq.([ds ] ) from @xmath82 to @xmath83 . using in addition eq.([sscc ] ) we can express the matrix elements eq.([me ] ) in terms of the scattering matrix variation @xmath84 pinching the qd to the coulomb blockade regime one can change the number of electrons in the qd one by one and measure the variation of the conductance matrix @xmath85 due to an additional electron in the qd @xcite . since @xmath86 , this is a way to measure ( in case of simple enough ns geometry ) the variation @xmath87 and the matrix elements @xmath32 .",
    "this procedure was performed experimentally @xcite for the simplest ns , being a one channel point contact .",
    "dephasing is closely related to current noise since current fluctuations are related to charge density fluctuations by the continuity equation . the results obtained in @xcite for the current noise can be presented in the following form @xmath88 here the left hand side is the @xmath79 fourier component of the current cross - correlator in terminals @xmath47 and @xmath49 , @xmath89 with @xmath90 where the scattering matrix is at @xmath91 .",
    "one can see that a _ single terminal _ @xmath92 contributes to @xmath93 only if ss s emitted from this terminal reach both terminals @xmath47 and @xmath49 , and that this contribution , given by the term with @xmath94 is always equilibrium .",
    "_ pairs of terminals _ @xmath92 and @xmath95 contribute to @xmath93 only if ss s emitted from each of these terminals reach both terminals @xmath47 and @xmath49 .",
    "this contribution given by terms with @xmath96 contains a nonequilibrium part .",
    "these conditions are very similar to those in case of dephasing .",
    "we consider first a simple one channel 2-terminal device with a gate and a qd ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the scattering matrix of the gate ( in the absence of an electron in the qd ) is @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 correspond to reflection and transmission of the ss s approaching the gate from left , while @xmath100 and @xmath101 correspond to the ss s approaching the gate from the right .",
    "if the magnetic field @xmath102 the scattering matrix is not symmetric , @xmath103 .    in case of zero temperature the equilibrium part of the qd state dephasing rate vanishes , and the nonequilibrium",
    "part is according to eq.([gv0 ] ) and eq.([ws ] ) @xmath104 here @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 are the changes of the transmission and the reflection amplitudes due to the electron in the qd .",
    "this result was obtained in @xcite for @xmath108 and a symmetric gate .",
    "the shot noise in this device ( in the absence of an electron in the qd ) is @xcite @xmath109    both the dephasing and the shot - noise are due to the same nonequilibrium fluctuations , but they are _ not proportional _ to each other .",
    "to get some insight , consider first zero or a weak magnetic field , when both ss s 1 and 2 occupy the whole crossection of the sample ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . if we assume there is no reflection from the gate , i.e. @xmath110 , @xmath111 , we find @xmath112 , while @xmath113 .",
    "the dephasing is nonzero because ss s emitted from different terminals overlap near the qd , while the shot noise is zero because each terminal ( where the shot noise is measured ) is feeded only by one ss .",
    "the situation for the shot noise changes if the gate is reflecting , in which case each terminal is feeded by both ss s .",
    "one can understand this difference from the following simple calculation . in a channel without reflection",
    "the wave function is @xmath114 , where the two terms are ss s coming from the left and right terminals .",
    "the corresponding charge and current densities are @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "what is important for nonequilibrium fluctuations is the overlap of ss s coming from different terminals , i.e. terms proportional to @xmath117 .",
    "such terms do not exist in @xmath118 but do exist in @xmath119 .",
    "this is why the shot - noise is zero , while the dephasing rate is not .",
    "the term @xmath120 is of quantum origin .",
    "it means that in a quasiclassical situation , when the number of channels is large , this term will average out due to `` integration '' over @xmath121 .",
    "when the gate is reflecting , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , both @xmath124 and @xmath125 contain terms proportional to @xmath117 .",
    "one can easily check it using , for example , the wave function to the left of the barrier @xmath126+b{\\tilde t}e^{-ikx}$ ] .",
    "it is also important to notice that for @xmath127 the current and charge fluctuations are not coupled by the continuity equation .",
    "consider now the same device in a strong magnetic field when the ss s are edge states ( es s ) localized near the boundaries .",
    "we assume also that the qd is far from the gate and the interaction region does not reach es2 .",
    "in this situation due to the chirality of es1 the qd can change only the phases of @xmath99 and @xmath100 . as a result @xmath128 ,",
    "i.e. the dephasing rate is proportional to the shot - noise .",
    "this is because _ for chiral states _ the current and charge densities are proportional , @xmath129 . ( the connection between dephasing and the phase of @xmath99 was mensioned in @xcite ) .    as a second example we consider a 4-terminal device similar to that used in experiment @xcite , with a geometry as shown in fig.3 .",
    "the source s ( @xmath130 ) and the drain d ( @xmath131 ) are used to bias the device .",
    "two floating terminals , one down - stream from s to d ( @xmath132 ) and one up - stream from d to s ( @xmath133 ) are `` dephasors '' according to @xcite . gate a regulates the source - drain current , while gates b and c block the floating terminals . the qd is located far from gate b. we assume there is only one ll at the fermi energy and that the es s at opposite edges are well separated and do not overlap .",
    "we will be interested only in nonequilibrium dephasing and consider zero temperature .",
    "the ss s emitted from the up - stream floating terminal 4 do not reach the interaction region and hence this terminal does not contribute to the dephasing of the qd .",
    "( in what follows it is assumed that this terminal is blocked ) . only scattering states emitted from terminals 1,2 , and 3 overlap in the interaction region , and hence in accordance with eq.([gammas ] )",
    "one has @xmath134 since the qd is located far from point contact b , all ss s in the interaction region have the form of the same es @xmath135 with different amplitudes , i.e. @xmath136 here @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath140 are the reflection and transmission amplitudes for es s approaching a from left and from right .",
    "@xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , @xmath144 correspond to es s approaching b from above and below .",
    "the phase factors @xmath145 depend on the position of the qd .",
    "the relevant matrix elements eq.([eme ] ) are    @xmath146    where @xmath147 using these matrix elements we find @xmath148 with the constant @xmath149 .",
    "when terminal 3 is open , i.e. @xmath150 , ss1 and ss2 are absorbed in this terminal and then the interaction region is reached only by ss3 .",
    "there is no overlap in the interaction region of ss s emitted from different terminals and as a result all the contributions to nonequilibrium dephasing rate vanish .",
    "when terminal 3 is blocked , i.e. @xmath151 we find @xmath152 .",
    "since terminal 3 is floating @xmath153 is given by the condition that the current entering this terminal is zero , which leads to @xmath154 .",
    "using this one finds @xmath155 one can see from this result that @xmath156 , i.e. the floating terminal suppresses the nonequilibrium dephasing rate of the qd state .",
    "this result is in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that the suppression is not because of dephasing the ss s coming to the interaction region .",
    "the absolute values of the matrix elements that enter the expression of the dephasing rate according to eq.([gv0 ] ) do not depend on the phases of the ss s overlapping in the interaction region .",
    "if one would simply destroy their phases it would not affect the dephasing rate @xmath157 .",
    "the floating terminal suppresses @xmath157 because it absorbs the ss s moving towards the interaction region from _",
    "different terminals_. it is important to have in mind that a theory based on the representation eq.([ss ] ) assumes that terminals absorb incoming waves as black bodies , which means that terminals have infinite capacitance .",
    "it is instructive to compare the dephasing rate with the shot noise .",
    "when terminal 3 is blocked the shot noise is known to be @xmath158 using eq .",
    "( [ ] ) one can see that opening terminal 3 does not change @xmath159 but suppress @xmath160 by exactly the same factor @xmath161 as the dephasing rate .",
