    "as a result of developments in the infrastructure of cellular networks , there has been a recent growing interest in the potential of _ cooperative _ transmission techniques where , through a backhaul link , messages can be available at more than one transmitter , i.e. , coordinated multi - point ( comp ) transmission .",
    "this new development has a proven advantage  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) for mitigating the effect of interfering signals , in particular , for cell - edge users .",
    "we formally pose the problem of maximizing the sum rate in a multiuser channel with comp transmission by defining a _ cooperation order _",
    "constraint , which bounds the maximum number of transmitters at which any message can be available by a cooperation order @xmath4 .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the fully connected gaussian interference channel model with generic channel coefficients ( as defined in  @xcite ) , and study the degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the channel while allowing each message to be available at @xmath4 transmitters .",

    ", the dof number for the @xmath0user channel was shown to be upper bounded by @xmath8 , i.e. , the per user dof number is upper bounded by @xmath9 .",
    "this was shown to be achievable through the interference alignment ( ia ) scheme in  @xcite .    in  @xcite",
