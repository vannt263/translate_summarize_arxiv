    "sne ii usually have a very fast rising lasting very few days . through the comparison of the early light curve of sn",

    "sn  2009bw is almost identical to sn  2013ej in the light curve shape and the absolute magnitude ( see fig .",

    "is usually connected to the radius of the progenitor at the time of its explosion .",
    "the slower the rise time , the more compact the progenitor .",

    "simple analytic functions have been developed @xcite to give a rough estimate of the radius of the progenitor of core - collapse sne using the temperature evolution at early phases .",
    "for instance , the sn photosphere after the explosion of a red supergiant ( rsg ) remains at an higher temperature for a longer time than what occurs in a more compact blue supergiant ( bsg ) . making use of our spectro photometric data within one week from the shock - breakout and the eq",

    "@xmath23 the temperature evolution of sn  2013ej is consistent with that of a progenitor with radius 400 - 600 @xmath24 .",
    "we remark that no host reddening was assumed in this calculation of the progenitor radius , which is consistent with the lack of naid lines at the redshift of m74 in the echelle spectrum obtained with the 1.82 m asiago telescope ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) . with the addition of some host reddening , the temperature and consequently the radius estimates would be larger .",
    "+ the likely rsg progenitor star identified by fraser et al .",
    "( 2013 ) has a luminosity of @xmath25dex , which would imply radii of 400 - 800r@xmath26 for m - type supergiant stellar effective temperatures .",
    "these radii are also consistent with that of the type iip sn  2009bw @xcite , which shares several other characteristics with sn  2013ej , as we will discuss in the next section . + the inferred radius values should be confirmed with more detailed models , but here we may safely conclude that the temperature evolution of sn  2013ej is consistent with that expected in the explosion of an extended progenitor . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a we also present progenitor radius constraints for sn  2013ej utilizing our _ swift _ and optical broadband photometry , which generally agree with our spectroscopic results . we note that the temperature evolution inferred using the _ swift _ data is always lower than that derived from the optical data , suggesting that some uv line blanketing is already present at very early phases .",
    "we further compare the temperature evolution of sn  2013ej with those of other type ii sne . the photospheric temperatures and radii of sn  2013ej are similar to those of sn  2009bw and sn  2012a , while they are always higher than those of sn  1987a .",
    "in this letter we present the early photometric and spectroscopic evolution of sn  2013ej , a luminous type ii sn that exploded in the very nearby spiral galaxy m74 .",
    "data were obtained mostly with the 1 m and 2 m telescopes of the lcogt network , complemented with data from the pessto collaboration .",
    "the most interesting characteristic of our sequence of early - time spectra of sn  2013ej is a prominent absorption on the blue side of the . we interpret it as due to , since there is no evidence of high velocity hydrogen features in proximity other balmer or paschen lines .",
    "this absorption dip is not particularly strong in other _ slow rising _ type ii sne , although it was detected in sn  2009bw .",
    "@xcite proposed it to be an evidence that sn  2009bw was interacting with the h - rich csm already at early phases .",
    "however , for the reasons mentioned above , we do not find an unequivocal evidence of interaction in sn  2013ej - at least not before 30 days after explosion .",
    "nonetheless , we can not rule out that signatures of interaction between sn ejecta and csm may appear at later stages , since this was observed in a number of type ii sne @xcite .",
    "sn  2013ej shows an unusually slow rise to the light curve plateau .",
    "this property was observed only in the type iip sn  2006bp and sn  2009bw .",
