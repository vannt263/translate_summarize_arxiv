    "actinide dioxides form a group of important materials from technological viewpoints of a nuclear reactor fuel and a heterogeneous catalyst . on the other hand ,",
    "this material group has been actively investigated also from a viewpoint of basic science because of its high symmetry of the fluorite structure of the space group @xmath7.@xcite in the circumstance of such high symmetry of crystal structure , it is possible to observe peculiar ordering of multipole higher than dipole , when we change the kind of actinide ions . among several magnetic properties of actinide dioxides ,",
    "a mysterious low - temperature ordered phase of npo@xmath6 has attracted continuous attention in the research field of condensed matter physics .",
    "the phase transition in npo@xmath6 has been confirmed in 1953 from the observation of a peak in the specific heat around 25 k.@xcite due to the behavior of magnetic susceptibility,@xcite it has been first considered that the antiferromagnetic order occurs .",
    "unfortunately , no dipole moments have been observed in the low - temperature phase and a puzzling situation has continued .",
    "neutron scattering experiments have revealed that the ground state of the crystalline electric field ( cef ) potential is @xmath5 , @xcite which carries multipole moments . then , from several phenomenological works on the ordered phase , a key role of octupole degree of freedom has been focused .",
    "@xcite in fact , the octupole ordering has been strongly suggested by @xmath8o - nmr experiment @xcite and also by inelastic neutron scattering study.@xcite as for the microscopic origin of such higher - order multipole ordering , it has been shown that octupole order is stabilized by the orbital - dependent superexchange interaction , obtained by the second - order perturbation of @xmath0 electron hopping in the @xmath5 degenerate hubbard model on a fcc lattice.@xcite recently , significant contribution of dotriacontapole moment has been also pointed out.@xcite    since the multipole moments originate from @xmath0 electrons , it seems to be natural to consider the hubbard - like model of @xmath0 electrons . however , from the crystal structure of actinide dioxides , it is also important to include explicitly @xmath1 electrons , since actinide ion is surrounded by eight oxygens and the main hopping process between nearest neighbor sites should occur from the @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath2-@xmath3 model is more realistic hamiltonian for actinide dioxides .",
    "in fact , the @xmath2-@xmath3 model for actinide dioxides has been analyzed in the fourth - order perturbation theory in terms of @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization .",
    "@xcite then , it has been revealed that octupole order actually occurs even when we include oxygen @xmath1 electrons .",
    "however , there has been a peculiar point that the octupole phase appears _ only _ for the small absolute value of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are slater - koster integrals between @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "the reason of the sensitivity of the octupole ordered phase concerning the @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization has not been understood yet .    in order to clarify the role of @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization for the appearance of octupole ordering , maehira and hotta",
    "have performed the band - structure calculations for actinide dioxides by a relativistic linear augmented - plane - wave method with the exchange - correlation potential in a local density approximation.@xcite it has been found that the energy bands in the vicinity of the fermi level are mainly due to the hybridization between actinide @xmath0 and oxygen @xmath1 electrons .",
    "it has been also pointed out that the electronic structure at the @xmath12 point in the first brillouin zone is not consistent with that of the local cef state .",
    "one reason for this inconsistency is that the cef potentials are not satisfactorily included in the calculations , but it is difficult to control the magnitudes of cef potential and @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization in the band - structure calculations . it is highly requested to reveal the role of @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization for the simultaneous explanation of the octupole ordering and the local cef states .    in this paper , in order to clarify the roles of hybridization between actinide @xmath0 and oxygen @xmath1 electrons for the electronic structure of actinide dioxides , we analyze the tight - binding @xmath2-@xmath3 model in detail . except for the slater - koster integrals of @xmath11 and @xmath10 ,",
    "we determine the parameters in the model from the comparison with experimental results and band - structure calculations . in order to reproduce the result of the relativistic band - structure calculations and obtain the electronic structure consistent with the local cef state ,",
    "we find that the slater - koster parameters for @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization should be limited in a certain range .",
    "a typical result is found for @xmath13 and @xmath14 ev , which is consistent with the condition for the appearance of the octupole ordering .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , in order to make this paper self - contained , we briefly review the relativistic band - structure calculations for actinide dioxides .",
    "it is meaningful to define the problems included in the band - structure calculations . in sec .",
    "iii , we explain a way to construct the @xmath2-@xmath3 model in the tight - binding approximation . then , we determine the parameters of the model , except for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , from the comparison with the experimental and band - structure calculation results . in sec .",
    "iv , we depict the energy band structure of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model by changing the values of @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization .",
    "we deduce the reasonable regions for @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss some future problems concerning the electronic structure of actinide dioxides . finally , we summarize this paper . throughout this paper , we use such units as @xmath15=@xmath16=1 .",
    "let us briefly review the band - structure calculation results in order to clarify the problem in the understanding of electronic structure of actinide dioxides . as for details , readers should consult ref .  .",
    "we have performed the calculations by using the relativistic linear augmented - plane - wave ( rlapw ) method .",
    "we assume that all @xmath0 electrons are itinerant and perform the calculations in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "note that we should take into account relativity even in the calculations for solid state physics because of large atomic numbers of the constituent atoms .",
    "the spatial shape of the one - electron potential is determined in the muffin - tin approximation .",
    "we use the exchange and correlation potential in a local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the self - consistent calculation is carried out for the experimental lattice constant for actinide dioxides .",
    "obtained by the self - consistent rlapw method .",
    "note that we pick up only @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands around @xmath17 , which indicate the position of the fermi level.,width=302 ]    in fig .  1",
    ", we show a typical result for npo@xmath6 along the symmetry axes in the brillouin zone . in the energy band structure in the vicinity of @xmath17 , there always occurs a hybridization between actinide @xmath0 and oxygen @xmath1 states for actinide dioxides .",
    "the lowest six bands originate from the oxygen @xmath1 states and are fully occupied and the width of oxygen @xmath1 band is about 4.76 ev .",
    "narrow bands lying in the region 4.5 - 7.5 ev are the @xmath0 bands which are split into two subbands by the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the spin - orbit splitting in the @xmath0 states is estimated as 0.95 ev , which is consistent with that for isolated neutral np atom .",
    "note that in the lda calculation , we find the metallic state for npo@xmath6 , not the insulating state .",
    "this point will be discussed later .",
    "here we remark that @xmath18 doublet and @xmath19 quartet levels appear around @xmath17 at the @xmath12 point .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath4 level is lower than the @xmath5 in our band - structure calculations .",
    "however , from the cef analysis on the basis of the @xmath20-@xmath20 coupling scheme , @xmath5 becomes lower than @xmath4 in actinide dioxides .",
    "when we accommodate @xmath0 electrons in @xmath5 orbitals , we obtain @xmath21 triplet for @xmath22=2 , @xmath5 quartet for @xmath22=3 , and @xmath23 singlet for @xmath22=4 , as experimentally found in the cef ground states of uo@xmath6 @xcite , npo@xmath6 @xcite , and puo@xmath6 @xcite . note here that @xmath22 denotes the number of local @xmath0 electrons .    in order to resolve the problems , it is necessary to improve the method to include the effect of cef potentials beyond the simple estimation of the madelung potential energy . however , it is a difficult task to perform such improvement concerning the formulation of the band - structure calculation .",
    "thus , in this paper , we choose an alternative method to exploit the tight - binding @xmath2-@xmath3 model for the purpose to understand the role of @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization for the change of cef states in the tight - binding model . by changing the parameters in the @xmath2-@xmath3 model ,",
    "we attempt to clarify the key quantities which characterize the electronic structure of actinide dioxides .",

    "we emphasize that it is one of the key points concerning the @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization to understand the electronic structure of actinide dioxides .     between @xmath4 and @xmath5 states at the @xmath12 point in the @xmath20=5/2 bands as a function of @xmath11 for @xmath10=@xmath155 ev ( solid curve ) , @xmath10=@xmath156 ev ( broken curve ) , and @xmath10=@xmath157 ev ( dotted curve ) .",

    ", we depict the energy difference @xmath158 between the @xmath5 and @xmath4 states at the @xmath12 point as functions of @xmath11 for several values of @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath158 is positive when @xmath5 is lower than @xmath4 . for @xmath10=0 , we find that @xmath158 is positive in the region of @xmath159 ev .",
    "when we change the value of @xmath10 , @xmath158 is found to be maximum at @xmath160 due to the effective disappearance of the @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization between actinide @xmath4 and oxygen @xmath1 electrons .",
    "readers may consider that the absolute value of @xmath11 should not be so small only for the purpose to keep the order of the local cef states .",
    "however , if we increase the absolute value of @xmath11 for @xmath161 ev , we should remark that the @xmath2- and @xmath3-electron bands are significantly changed from those in the relativistic band - structure calculation results .",
    "thus , from the viewpoints of the local cef states and the comparison with the band - structure calculations , the reasonable parameters are found in the case of small @xmath162 for @xmath161 ev .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the tight - binding model for ano@xmath6 in comparison with the local cef states and the result of the relativistic band - structure calculations .",
    "we have concluded that @xmath162 should be small for the case of @xmath161 ev in our tight - binding model in order to keep the cef levels at the @xmath12 point .",
    "we have also emphasized that such a condition coincides with that for the octupole ordering on the basis of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model.@xcite namely , the condition to keep the local @xmath5 ground state is consistent with the appearance of the ordering of magnetic octupole which is composed of complex spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "here we provide a comment on the local cef state in the band - structure calculations . as long as we perform the band - structure calculations with in the lda",
    ", it is found that the @xmath4 state becomes lower than the @xmath5 at the @xmath12 point , in contrast to the local cef state expected from the experiment . in this paper , we have proposed the scenario to control the effect of @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization on the cef state , but it should be remarked that in the lda calculation , we could @xmath163 obtain insulating state corresponding to the multipole ordering for npo@xmath6.@xcite in order to improve this point , we need to consider the effect of the coulomb interactions , but it is a serious problem .",
    "one way for this problem is to employ the lda+@xmath164 method .",
    "in fact , it has been reported that we the ordered state with octupole and higher multipoles can be reproduced,@xcite suggesting that the @xmath5 state is lower than @xmath4 in the electronic structure .",
    "the effective inclusion of the coulomb interaction is an alternative scenario to understand the cef state consistent with the experiments .",
    "although we have not discussed the difference in electronic structure due to the change of actinide ions in this paper , it is naively expected that the difference between @xmath136 and @xmath119 becomes small in the order of th , u , np , pu , am , and cm from the chemical trends in actinide ions and the previous band - structure calculations",
    ". on the other hand , the change of @xmath2-@xmath3 hybridization among actinide dioxides may play more important role to explain the effect of the difference in actinide ions .",
    "it is an interesting future problem to clarify the key issue to understand the difference in electronic structure of actinide dioxides .    in summary",
    ", we have constructed the @xmath2-@xmath3 model in the tight - binding approximation .",
    "we have determined the parameters by the experimental results and the relativistic band - structure calculations .",
    "it has been concluded that the absolute value of @xmath11 should be small for @xmath10=1 ev in order to reproduce simultaneously the local cef states and the band - structure calculation results .",
    "the small value of @xmath162 is consistent with the condition to obtain the octupole ordering in the previous analysis of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model .",
