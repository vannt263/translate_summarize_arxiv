    "all theoretical methods used so far to describe breakup rely on a basic approximation to describe the collision with only the three - body variables of nucleon coordinate , projectile coordinate , and target coordinate .",
    "thus the dynamics is controlled by the three potentials describing nucleon - core , nucleon - target , and core - target interactions . in most cases the projectile - target relative motion is treated semiclassically by using a trajectory of the center of the projectile relative to the center of the target @xmath0 with constant velocity @xmath1 in the @xmath2 direction and impact parameter * b@xmath3 * in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "this approximation makes our formalism applicable for incident energies above the coulomb barrier . along this trajectory",
    "the amplitude for a transition from a nucleon state @xmath5 bound in the projectile , to a final continuum state @xmath6 , is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the interaction responsible for the transition which will be specified in the following .",
    "the probabilities for different processes can be represented in terms of the amplitude as @xmath9 where @xmath10 can be momentum , energy or any other variable for which a differential cross section is measured .",
    "direct one - particle re - arrangment reactions of the peripheral type in presence of strong core - target absorption can be described by an equation like @xcite @xmath11 ( see eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) of @xcite ) and c@xmath12s is the spectroscopic factor for the initial single particle state . the core survival probability is defined in terms of a s - matrix function of the core - target distance of closest approach @xmath13 .",
    "a simple parameterisation is @xmath14)}.$ ] it takes into account the peripheral nature of the reaction and naturally excludes the possibility of large overlaps between projectile and target .",
    "the strong absorption radius r@xmath15 fm is defined as the distance of closest approach for a trajectory that is 50% absorbed from the elastic channel and a=0.6 fm is a diffuseness parameter .",
    "the values of r@xmath16 thus obtained agree within a few percent with those of the kox parameterization@xcite .",
    "let us call _ projectile fragmentation _ the elastic breakup ( diffraction dissociation ) reaction , when the observable studied is the neutron - core relative energy spectrum .",
    "this kind of observable has been widely measured in relation to the coulomb breakup on heavy target .",
    "results on light targets have also been presented @xcite .",
    "these data enlighten the effect of the neutron final state interaction with the core of origin , while observables like the core energy or momentum distributions enlighten the effect of the neutron final state interaction with the target .",
    "projectile fragmentation has also been used to study two neutron halo projectiles @xcite-@xcite . in this case",
    "it has been suggested that the reaction might proceed by the simultaneous emission of the two neutrons or by successive emissions @xcite .",
    "the successive emission can be due to a mechanism in which one neutron is stripped by the interaction with the target , as in the one - neutron fragmentation case , while the other is left behind , for example in a resonance state , which then decays .",
    "this mechanism has been described by the sudden approximation@xcite under the hypothesis that while the first neutron is stripped , the second neutron is emitted at large impact parameters with no final state interaction with the target .",
    "the emission can be expected sequential if the two neutrons are not strongly correlated .",
    "if the two neutrons are strongly correlated they will preferentially be emitted simultaneously .",
    "if the neutron which is not detected is stripped while the other suffers an elastic scattering on the target , then in both cases to first order in the interaction the neutron ends - up in a plane wave final state @xcite .",
    "it can then re - interact with the core which , for example , is going to be @xmath17be in the case of the one - neutron halo projectile @xmath18be , while it will be @xmath19be in the case of the projectile fragmentation of @xmath20be , since @xmath21be is not bound .",
    "experiments with a @xmath20b projectile @xcite have also been performed , in which the n-@xmath19be relative energy spectra have been reconstructed by coincidence measurements .",
    "in such a nucleus the valence neutron is weakly bound , while the valence proton is strongly bound .",
    "thus the neutron will probably be emitted in the first step and then re - scattered by the core minus one proton nucleus .",
    "the projectile - target distances at which this kind of mechanism would be relevant are probably not so large to neglect the effect of the neutron - target interaction .      to first order the inelastic - like excitations can be described again by the time dependent perturbation amplitude eq.([1 ] ) @xcite . in this section also , the potential @xmath22 , which is the interaction responsible for the neutron transition , moves past on a constant velocity path as described in the previous sections .",
    "the radial part @xmath23 of the single particle initial state wave function @xmath24 is calculated in a potential @xmath25 which is fixed in space .",
    "the coordinate system and other details of the calculations can be found in ref.@xcite . in the special case of exotic nuclei",
    "the traditional approach to inelastic excitations needs to be modified .",
    "for example the final state can be eigenstate of a potential @xmath26 modified with respect to @xmath27 because some other particle is emitted during the reaction process as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the final state interaction might also have an imaginary part which would take into account the coupling between a continuum state and an excited core .",
    "the first order time dependent perturbation amplitude then reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 and we changed variables and put @xmath30 or @xmath31 , @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the neutron - core relative energy in the final state .",
    "the rle of the target represented by @xmath34 is just to perturb the initial bound state wave function and to allow the transition to the continuum by transferring some momentum to the neutron .",
    "then it is enough to choose a simplified form of the interaction , such as a delta - function potential @xmath35 .",
    "the value of the strength @xmath36 [ mev @xmath37 used in the calculation is taken equal to the volume integral of the appropriate neutron - target interaction .",
    "it is clear that while in the sudden approach the initial and final state overlap is taken in the whole coordinate space , irrespective of the target and of the beam velocity , here the overlap of the initial and final wave functions depends on the core - target impact parameter .",
    "the neutron is emitted preferentially on the reaction plane and the z - component , being along the relative velocity axis is boosted by a momentum @xmath38 .",
    "due of the strong core absorption discussed in sec.1 these calculations are performed using the asymptotic form of the initial and final state wave functions . introducing the quantization condition@xcite the probability spectrum reads @xmath39 the generalization including spin",
    "is given in appendix b of ref.@xcite and @xmath40 the quantity @xmath41 is an off - the - energy - shell s - matrix representing the final state interaction of the neutron with the projectile core .",

    "the main d@xmath46 strength is in the continuum centered around 1.25 .",
    "we have calculated the initial wave function for the s - state in a simple woods - saxon potential with strength fitted to the experimental separation energy and whose parameters are : r@xmath47=1.25 fm , a=0.8 fm . as possible final states we have considered only the s , p and",

    "similarly to the present model , a classical , straight line trajectory for the core - target scattering was used in ref.@xcite .",
    "also our n - core potentials are very close to those of ref.@xcite and our @xmath42-interaction strength is consistent with the volume integral of their neutron - target interaction . we have then folded the calculated spectrum througth the experimental resolution function of fukuda et al .",

    "uncertainties in the interpretation of experimental results as compared to structure calculations were at the origin of our motivations to try to understand whether the neutron-@xmath19be relative energy spectra obtained from fragmentation of @xmath20be or @xmath20b would show differences predictable in a theoretical model .",
    "if differences will be found in the experimental results with @xmath20b and @xmath20be beams they could be due to an interplay between structure and reaction effects .",

    "however , as it has been discussed in the previous section , the situation is much more complicated @xcite-@xcite and in particular the calculations of ref .",

    "the present experimental information @xcite on @xmath20b is that the neutron is in a state combination of s and d - components with weights 66% and 30% respectively , while shell model calculations show a similar mixture and no component with an excited state of the core .",

    "these unbound states would decay showing the s - wave threshold and d - wave resonance effects . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the second possibility is that the neutron is knocked out first due to its small separation energy and that the proton is stripped from the remaining @xmath21b .",
