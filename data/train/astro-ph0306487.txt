    "the evolution of large  scale structure in an expanding universe model is one of the most important and interesting problems in cosmology .",
    "it is generally believed that these structures have formed owing to gravitational instability .",
    "after structure has formed , the combined action of multi  stream forces and gravity is responsible for their stability in time ( buchert & domnguez 1998 ) , eventually leading to ` virialized ' structures on certain spatial scales such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "such equilibrium states , if they persist in time , are not necessarily in thermodynamical equilibrium , but are the consequence of a process that was termed by gurevich & zybin ( see their review 1995 and refs . therein ) _ non  dissipative gravitational turbulence _ , emphasizing the role of multi  stream forces that counteract the gravitational action and so eventually lead to equilibrium structures , supported by velocity dispersion in collisionless systems .    here",
    "we consider collisionless particles as candidates for cold dark matter , and focus our interest on universal behavior in the gravitational collapse process .",
    "the hope is to discover some rules that govern the multi  streaming hierarchy in a self  gravitating system . in this research note",
    "we shall concentrate on the simplest model of a plane ",
    "symmetric ` single  wave ' perturbation on an expanding universe model ; the discovery of universality laws needs a detailed study at high  spatial resolution .",
    "an advantage of plane symmetry is the existence of exact solutions that we shall incorporate in our numerical scheme .",
    "other aspects of multi  streaming have already been studied in three spatial dimensions ( see , e.g. , kofman et al . 1994 ) , and there is a plethora of works on powerlaw , fractal , or self ",
    "similar scaling properties of the density field , which are all indirectly related to the understanding of multi  stream systems . also numerical simulations of self ",
    "gravitating systems practically evolve a multi ",
    "stream flow on smaller spatial scales .",
    "recently , yano & gouda ( 1998 ) have studied the time evolution of density perturbations in the plane  symmetric system .",
    "they showed that the power spectrum of the evolved perturbations can be roughly separated into five regimes , having initially power  law shape and a cutoff scale as shown in figure 1 .    according to these results ,",
    "we can first separate the power spectrum roughly into three regimes on the scales larger than the cutoff scale : one is the linear regime ( @xmath1 : regime 1 ) .",
    "the value of the power index in this regime remains the initial power index , @xmath2 .",
    "the second regime is the single  caustic regime ( @xmath3 : regime 2 ) . in this regime ,",
    "the power index becomes @xmath4 and is independent of the initial conditions .",
    "this result is caused by the appearance of caustics at this scale , and these caustics determine the power index of the power spectrum in this regime .",
    "the third regime is the multi ",
    "caustics regime ( @xmath5 : regime 3 ) . in this regime , caustics on various scales of waves determine the power spectrum .",
    "therefore , on these scales , the power spectral index @xmath6 can be traced back to initial conditions .    on the scales smaller than the cutoff scale",
    "the problem is more involved .",
    "nevertheless , we can roughly separate the power spectrum into two more regimes : after the appearance of the first caustic , the power index in the regime of the scale smaller than the cutoff scale becomes @xmath4 .",
    "this value is , as mentioned above , caused by the appearance of caustics .",
    "however , thereafter , more and more caustics appear and so the separation of caustics becomes smaller and smaller . even after the appearance of many caustics , on scales smaller than the characteristic separation of the caustics ( @xmath7 : regime 5 ) , the power index of the power spectrum can be obtained by the density profile around the singular point : the power index on these scales also becomes @xmath4 , a result that can be derived from catastrophe theory ( or the lagrange ",
    "singularity theory , respectively ) , see , e.g. , arnold et al .",
    "1982 , kotok & shandarin ( 1988 ) , gouda & nakamura ( 1988 , 1989 ) , yano & gouda ( 1998 ) . on the other hand , on the scales",
    "larger than the characteristic separation of the caustics , in the fully developed ` virialized ' regime ( @xmath8 : regime 4 ) , the distribution of the singular points determines the power index on these scales instead of the density profile around one singularity : we may say that the smoothed density profile with the smoothing scale ( @xmath9 ) determines the power index . for a comprehensive description of the above discussion , see yano & gouda ( 1998 ) .",
    "in this paper we focus on the fully developed ` virialized ' multi  stream regime ( @xmath8 ) to clarify the physical process of the appearances of the caustics , and we are going to estimate a value for the power index of the power spectrum in this regime .",
    "for this purpose we study the time ",
    "intervals of the appearances of the caustics as well as the spatial distribution of the caustics at subsequent times .",
    "the initial condition is chosen as ` single  wave ' perturbation defined by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the velocity , @xmath12 is the position of a sheet , and @xmath13 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the evolution of such a perturbation determines the power spectral index in the ` virialized ' regime , essentially region 4 in figure 1 .",
    "accordingly we succeed to find some universal rules about the time when each caustic appears , the spatial distribution of the caustics at subsequent times , and the distribution of mass for each caustic .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in @xmath14",
    ", we will briefly explain the numerical method to calculate the time evolution of density perturbations in the expanding universe model .",
    "in @xmath15 we show the numerical results providing some rules for the time  appearances of caustics , the spatial distribution of caustics at subsequent times , and the mass distribution for each caustic . here",
    ", we also evaluate the power index of the power spectrum in the ` virialized ' regime .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary and a brief outlook .",
    "we investigate the time evolution of a plane  symmetric density perturbation in an einstein  de sitter universe model by using a semi  numerical method . in the one  dimensional",
    "system many plane ",
    "parallel sheets move only in perpendicular direction to the surface of these sheets .",
    "when two sheets cross , they are allowed to pass through eachother freely . in this sheet system , there is an exact solution until two sheets cross over as follows ( zeldovich 1970 , sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 , doroshkevich et.al .",
    "1973 , zentsova & chernin 1980 , buchert 1989 , yano & gouda 1998 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath12 are the lagrangian and the ( comoving ) eulerian coordinates , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath18 , and @xmath19 are arbitrary functions of @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the growing mode and the decaying mode of linear perturbation solutions , respectively .",
    "we are considering the einstein  de sitter background universe model , i.e. , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the scale factor .",
    "the velocity @xmath11 is the peculiar ",
    "velocity normalized by the scale  factor .",
    "we can compute the crossing time of all neighboring pairs of sheets .",
    "we use the shortest of these crossing times as a time step .",
    "then , we can compute the new positions and velocities for all sheets at this crossing time .",
    "after two sheets cross , we exchange the velocities of two sheets that just crossed .",
    "then we obtain again @xmath25 , and therefore exact solutions as follows : @xmath26 these new exact solutions can be used until again two sheets cross . in this way",
    "we obtain the exact loci of the sheets by coupling these solutions . this semi ",
    "numerical method has good accuracy , because we connect exact solutions .    in our calculation",
    "we are going to use @xmath27 sheets .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are fixed at a length of @xmath28 .",
    "then we consider the evolution of the ` single  wave ' perturbation whose wave number is @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we calculate the time ",
    "intervals for the appearances of caustics , the spatial distribution of caustics at subsequent times , and the mass distribution for each caustic .",
    "accordingly we find some rules for the evolution of the caustic distribution .",
    "using these rules , we are going to estimate the power index of the power spectrum in the ` virialized ' regime .",
    "we examine the time evolution of the ` single  wave ' perturbation setting @xmath29 and @xmath30 in equations ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "then , comoving positions @xmath12 and scaled peculiar ",
    "velocities @xmath11 of each sheet are simplified to : @xmath31 see figure 2-a .",
    "hereafter we call this case the _ single  wave case_.    the first caustic has just appeared at the center of the x  axis ( @xmath32 ) in figure 2-b . after the first appearance of a caustic ,",
    "more caustics appear at the center ( phase mixing starts in phase space ) ( figures 2-c  2-d ) ( doroshkevich et .",
    "al . 1980 ; melott 1983 ; gouda & nakamura 1989 ; yano & gouda 1998 ) .",
    "according to this cascade of appearing caustics , the density distribution evolves as in figures ( 3-a  3-d ) .",
    "figures 2-a , 2-b , 2-c , and 2-d correspond to figures 3-a , 3-b , 3-c , and 3-d , respectively .",
    "as we see from figures 3-a , 3-b , 3-c , and 3-d , a hierarchy of nested density peaks appears in the course of time .    in order to discover rules for the distribution of the caustics at an arbitrary time , we sort the time",
    " intervals in the appearances of the caustics , the spatial distribution of the caustics , and the mass distribution for each caustic at a certain time as follows .",
    "first , we examine the time ",
    "intervals related to the appearances of the caustics .",
    "the solid line in figure 4 shows the time when caustics appear at the center of the x  axis ( a so  called a3type singularity ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the time ",
    "intervals for the appearances of caustics . as we can see from figure 4 , these time ",
    "intervals are almost constant . in order to clarify this point",
    ", we introduce the ratio of those intervals defined by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the time when the i  th caustics appears .",
    "then , the relation between @xmath35 and the time when the @xmath36th caustic appears is plotted in figure 5 .",
    "we see a loss of accuracy after around the 10th caustic appeared . nevertheless , independent of the number of sheets , we see that the value @xmath35 quickly converges to @xmath0",
    ". we can understand why the ratio becomes 1 as follows : according to the time evolution of the density distribution , more and more caustics appear at the center of the x  axis and these caustics may be viewed as forming a bound cluster . after the evolution of this cluster decouples from the expansion of the universe model , sheets around the center of the cluster",
    "behave like a harmonic oscillator due to the fact that an enhanced gravitational potential forces particles with velocities less than the escape velocity from the cluster to rebound .",
    "the periods of the oscillation of the sheets finally becomes independent of the amplitude .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable that the time  intervals of the appearances of caustics becomes constant , i.e. , the value of @xmath35 becomes 1 .",
    "second , we consider the spatial distribution of caustics . in figure 6",
    "we plot the spatial positions of caustics when the n  th caustic appears at the center of the x  axis . here",
    "we note that the number of appearances of caustics can be used instead of time , because we have already shown that the intervals may be considered practically constant .",
    "we define the position of a caustic , @xmath37 , as the @xmath36th position of a caustic at the time when the @xmath38th caustic appears .",
    "then , for example , @xmath39 represents the position of the @xmath36th caustic that has just appeared as a3type at the center of the x  axis .",
    "now , we examine the spatial positions of caustics at a certain time ( @xmath40 ) . we adopt @xmath41 in our analysis because the accuracy of the positions of caustics decreases for @xmath42 as shown in figure 5 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in figure 7 denote the spatial position of the @xmath43th caustic , @xmath44 , and the spatial interval between the ( n-1)th and the n  th caustics , @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "furthermore we depict the corresponding ratios : the solid and dashed lines in figure 8 depict the ratio of spatial positions @xmath46 and the ratio of spatial intervals @xmath47 , respectively . in figure 8",
    "we see no constant in the spatial positions or spatial intervals of caustics at first glance .    however , we see a constant when we plot positions of the nearest caustic from the center , @xmath48 , or the ratio @xmath49 . in figure 9 ,",
    "the relation between the position @xmath48 and the time when the n  th caustic appears is plotted .",
    "the ratio of positions @xmath49 is plotted in figure 10 . in figure 10",
    ", @xmath50 represents the ratio between the position of the nearest caustic from the center and that of the second nearest caustic from the center @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 represents the ratio between the nearest caustic from the center at the ( n-1)th appearance of a caustic and that at the nth appearance of a caustic @xmath49 .",
    "both ratios feature constants : the ratio @xmath50 and @xmath52 have values of around @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "if we plot positions of caustics by using a logarithmic scale of spatial positions and a linear scale of time , we can see some `` lattice '' as shown in figure 11 .",
    "this apparent regularity is the result of the existence of constants in the ratios .",
    "here we note that calculated positions are not exact for smaller than about @xmath55 because of finite sheet resolution .",
    "therefore , the `` lattice '' is destroyed after around the 10th appearance of caustics .",
    "third , we investigate the mass distribution for each caustic at a certain time @xmath56 . here",
    ", we define the mass , @xmath57 , as proportional to the number of sheets which are located inbetween @xmath58 and @xmath59 at the time , when the nth caustic appears . the schematic picture of @xmath60 is shown in figure 12 .    then , we obtain the mass distribution for each caustic at @xmath41 , which is shown in table [ tbl-1 ] and figure 13 .",
    "we deduce the following relation between @xmath36 and @xmath60 for large values of @xmath36 : @xmath61 since we know the spatial distribution of the caustics and the mass distribution for the caustics , we can construct the smoothed density profile to calculate the power index of the power spectrum in the ` virialized ' regime .      in this subsection",
    "we estimate the index of the power spectrum in the ` virialized ' regime , using the rules which we have found in the previous subsection . assuming that the spatial distribution of caustics obeys the law of a geometric series , @xmath62 that is , @xmath63 and also that the mass distribution for each caustic obeys the law of another geometric series , @xmath64 we find the density profile as : @xmath65 its fourier transform gives @xmath66 finally we obtain the power spectrum as : @xmath67 in fact",
    ", we have found @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the previous subsection , so that we obtain the power spectrum in the explicit form : @xmath70 on scales smaller than the characteristic scale @xmath71 ( regime 5 in figure 1 ) , the power index of the power spectrum becomes @xmath4 .",
    "this is because the density profile around one singular point determines the power spectrum on this scale .    on scales larger than the characteristic scale @xmath72",
    ", on the other hand , the density profile in the spatial interval , where the singular points lie closer than the scale of this interval , is smoothed , and the power index of the power spectrum deviates from @xmath4 .",
    "the larger scales we consider , the more the density profile is smoothed .",
    "the power index in the ` virialized ' regime @xmath9 , accordingly , is determined by the smoothed density profile ( [ density - profile ] ) , and therefore the result for the power index of the power spectrum under the smoothed density profile is given by ( [ final ] ) .",
    "our result shows that the power index in the ` virialized ' regime @xmath9 may be approximated by the index value @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , let us note that the wavenumbers @xmath74 , which represent the characteristic separations of caustics , becomes larger and larger as time increases , since the characteristic separation of caustics becomes shorter and shorter .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of density perturbations after the first appearance of a caustic , exemplified for a plane ",
    "symmetric ` single  wave ' perturbation in an expanding universe model .",
    "following yano & gouda ( 1998 ) , who showed that the power spectrum can be roughly separated into five regimes with different power ",
    "law index , we have explored the fourth regime . the detailed analysis of a many  sheet system is needed in this regime in order to determine the time  evolution and the asymptotics of the power spectral index .    we have argued that the system of caustics displays some universality , after some time , with respect to regularity of time ",
    "intervals in the appearances of caustics , and the spatial distribution of caustics at subsequent times .",
    "first , we have noticed the existence of a rule for the time ",
    "intervals of the appearances of caustics : the ratio of intervals quickly approaches @xmath0 , a fact that we have made plausible .",
    "second , we have found some rules hidden in the spatial distribution of caustics : the ratio between a position of the nearest caustic from the center and that of the second nearest caustic from the center @xmath75 approaches a value of around @xmath53 . furthermore , the ratio between the nearest caustic from the center at the ( n-1)th appearance of a caustic and that at the nth appearance of a caustic @xmath76 attains a value of around @xmath54 .",
    "third , we have found a rule for the mass distribution for each caustic , that is , we have derived the density distribution of a cluster . the mass distribution for each caustic can be fit to a line with the geometric progression of ratio @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , using the above constants , we have found the smoothed density profile , and finally have evaluated the power index of the power spectrum in the ` virialized ' regime to be @xmath78 .",
    "this value is different from @xmath4 that is determined by the density profile around one singular point . in other words ,",
    "the power spectum in the region below the cutoff scale can be divided into two clearly distinct regions , the ` single  caustic ' regime and the ` virialized ' regime .",
    "these results are consistent with the numerical results by yano & gouda ( 1998 ) .",
    "the discovery presented in this research note , namely that there exist remarkable rules for the distribution of caustics , points towards several interesting theoretical implications for long  term properties of self  gravitating systems . as in studies of dynamical systems",
    "we here deal with a hierarchy of bifurcations .",
    "a fruitful way to explore universality properties further is to use renormalization group techniques similar to those developed for the feigenbaum scenario of pitchfork bifurcations ( see : feigenbaum 1978 , 1979 ; derrida et al .",
    "1979 ; collet & eckmann 1980 ) . with this note",
    "we have just provided a hint to the existence of universal constants .",
    "a detailed renormalization group and fixpoint analysis is needed to support these findings . in this context",
    "an interesting question has to remain open : the existence of chaotic regimes .      in this paper",
    "we have focused on one non ",
    "trivial regime , the ` virialized ' regime ( regime 4 in figure 1 ) , and have succeeded to evaluate the power index of the power spectrum in this regime semi  numerically . in order to complete the understanding of the evolution of the power spectra of density fluctuations , we have also to understand the behavior of the power index in the multi  wavenumbers regime ( regime 3 in figure 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we could employ the systematic framework of the velocity moment hierarchy to eventually derive analytically universal behavior of the density profile ; also , nonlinear statistical methods beyond the power spectrum would give more refined information .",
