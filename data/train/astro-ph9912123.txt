    "it is increasingly believed that the optical light curves of type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) differ between events in intrinsic peak luminosity and shape . moreover , the sn  ia peak luminosity appears to correlate with its optical decline at early times ; slower declining sne  ia have greater peak luminosity ( pskovskii 1977 , 1984 ; phillips 1993 ; hamuy _ et al .",

    "sn  1986 g is 0.40.5  mag fainter than sn  1998bu .",
    "random errors in distance moduli and extinction corrections are probably insufficient to account for the apparent lower luminosity of sn  1986 g .",
    "i conclude that this supernova was indeed significantly underluminous at this time .      since the work of elias _ et al .",

    "nothing can be said about sne  1972e or 1991 t as no ir observations are available during this time .      for three of the four events for which we have post-+25  d light curves",

    "the exception is sn  1986 g which is fainter in @xmath15 by typically one magnitude during much of this period .",

    "i find no significant trend of absolute @xmath3 or @xmath66 magnitude with @xmath4 .",
    "the dispersion is similar to that seen in the ir .",
    "it is therefore likely that the size of the sample considered here is simply too small and the uncertainties in the absolute ir magnitudes too large to reveal a @xmath4 relation of even comparable strength to that found in the optical region .",
    "+ the ir magnitudes of sn  1991 t at 11  days are @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( menzies & carter 1991 ) .",
    "these translate to the highest - ever ir - luminosities for a type  ia event , especially in the @xmath1 & @xmath2 region ( _ cf .",
    "although we lack coeval points from other supernovae , it appears that sn  1991 t was exceptionally ir - luminous for a sn  ia at this epoch .",

    "the 11  day photometry of sn  1991 t was the earliest ever observation of a sn  ia in the ir .",
    "the next earliest are the ir spectra of sn  1994d ( meikle _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) and photometry of sn  1998bu , both at about 8.5  d. they show no signs of unusually high luminosity",
    ". it may be that the exceptional early - time ir luminosity and redness of sn  1991 t are further manifestations of its intrinsic peculiarity .",
    "however , for the present , this result is something of a puzzle .",
    "+ the analysis presented here indicates that most sne  ia are _ standard _ ir candles at a level of about 0.15 mag . as already mentioned , elias _",
    "( 1995 ) suggested that sne  ia might have a dispersion in ir absolute magnitude as low as @xmath100.1  mag .",
    "the present work is consistent with this , although it also shows there can be exceptional events which are much brighter or fainter than the norm .",
    "moreover , although i find no indication of differences in coeval magnitudes for the six ir - normals , there is tentative evidence that the ir light curve _ shapes _ are not exactly identical .",
    "+ it should be kept in mind that this study makes use of only eight supernovae , and that their light curves are generally much less well - sampled than in the optical region .",
    "the _ total _",
    "number of photometry points for all six ir - normals is only about 60 in each band within the span of the elias _ et al _ templates .",
    "it is clearly desirable to pursue the use of sne  ia ir light curves as distance indicators . as a first step , we need to build up a good set of ir light curves for nearby sne  ia in order to establish the extent to which they are homogeneous .",
    "in addition , this will extend the wavelength range over which colour information is available and so should help to distinguish unambiguously between intrinsic colours and dust reddening .",
    "compared with the optical region , the lower sensitivity to extinction uncertainties in the ir should mean that observations in this wavelength region will provide more reliable estimates of cosmological distances .",
    "at the lowest redshifts dominated by the hubble expansion , ( @xmath79 ) , the peak ir magnitudes of sne  ia would lie in the range + 14 to + 20 .",
    "these magnitudes are well within the range of a 4  m class telescope such as ukirt ( _ cf .",
    "_ http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/jacpublic/ukirt/ + instruments",
    "/ ufti / sensitivities.html ) .",
    "indeed , the nearer supernovae could be successfully monitored by only a 2  m class telescope such as the liverpool telescope ( _ cf . _",
    "http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/inst/index.html ) . at higher redshifts ,",
    "say 0.5 , rest frame @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band emission are shifted into roughly the @xmath1- and @xmath2-bands respectively .",
    "( rest frame @xmath2-band emission would be lost in the thermal ir region . ) in a flat , @xmath80 universe an intrinsic peak absolute @xmath0-magnitude of 19.0 yields an apparent magnitude of about + 22.3 .",
    "this estimate includes only an approximate k - correction ( poggianti 1997 ) . as more sne  ia ir",
    "spectra become available , it should be possible to make more accurate estimates of the k - corrections . a @xmath81 sn  ia at @xmath82 has been successfully detected by j.  spyromilio in a 1-hour integration with the 3.5  m eso ntt ( riess et al .",
