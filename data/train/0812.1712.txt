    "such chains model particles connected by springs in one dimension and serve as simplified models for crystals and solids . in their seminal paper @xcite fermi ,",
    "pasta and ulam studied such chains assuming that the interaction potential @xmath5 contains at most quartic terms .",
    "we consider convex @xmath5 with nonlinear force function @xmath6 and allow for turning points , i.e. , points where @xmath7 , but still refer to as fpu chains .",
    "in fact , the existence of fronts , which is studied in this paper , requires that @xmath6 has at least one turning point , see @xcite , and this excludes , for instance , the famous toda potential .",
    "one focus of the research concerns solutions with coherent structures , in particular travelling waves , for which there exists a smooth profile that travels with constant speed and shape through the chain .",
    "the main types of travelling waves are periodic _ wave trains _ , homoclinic _ solitons _ ( or _ solitary waves _ ) , and heteroclinic _",
    "fronts_. mathematically , rigorous existence proofs of such solutions are an important basic issue . during the last two decades a lot of research addressed the existence of solitons and wave trains :",
    "@xcite establish the existence of such waves by solving constrained optimisation problems , @xcite apply the mountain path theorem to the action integral for travelling waves , and @xcite uses center manifold reduction with respect to the spatial dynamics .    in comparison ,",
    "little is known rigorously for fronts . for ( non",
    "- smooth and non - convex ) double - well potentials composed of the same quadratic parabolas , the existence of fronts connecting oscillatory states has been recently shown in @xcite .",
    "such fronts can be interpreted as phase transitions and more physical results can be found for instance in @xcite .    in these cases",
    "the connection between fronts and shocks in the naive continuum limit of was crucial .",
    "this limit is the so - called p - system formed by the hyperbolic conservation laws for mass and momentum .",
    "shocks in the p - system come in different types given by the relation of their speed and the sound speed of the asymptotic states : shocks that are faster ( slower ) than these sound speeds are called supersonic ( subsonic ) .",
    "the fronts found in @xcite for the quadratic double - well case correspond to subsonic shocks when taking the average of the asymptotic oscillations .",
    "it turns out that these shocks also balance the energy jump relation , and we refer to such shocks as conservative .",
    "the connection to p - system shocks is also crucial for our result , but we solely consider _ convex _ potentials and the fronts we find are _ supersonic _ , _ conservative _ , and _ monotone _ with constant asymptotic states , see figure  [ introfig2 ] . for such potentials , the only previous result concerning fronts we are aware of is the bifurcation result by iooss in @xcite for supersonic fronts of small amplitude connecting constant states near a convex - concave turning point of @xmath6 . a physical interpretation of these solutions is a deformation of the solid or crystal , though the fronts can travel in either direction for the same asymptotic states .",
    "related ` pulsating ' travelling waves have been studied in @xcite . here the profile of the wave changes periodically while moving and the asymptotic states are wave trains .",
    "it was shown that in the truncated normal form on the centre manifold , pulsating front solutions bifurcate from convex - concave turning points of @xmath6 .",
    "the analytical investigations in this paper are motivated by the numerical simulations of atomistic riemann problems which have recently been studied by the authors in @xcite .",
    "we observed fronts in numerical simulations of even for initial data that are far from the data of a front , see figure  [ introfig2 ] .",
    "hence , fronts are dynamically stable and provide fundamental building blocks for atomistic riemann solvers .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following .    [",
    "t : main]for all convex and smooth potentials @xmath5 the following assertions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "each front in the chain corresponds to a conservative shock in the p - system .",
    "2 .   for each supersonic conservative shock in the p - system that satisfies",
    "a certain area condition there exists a corresponding monotone front in the chain .    here `",
    "correspond ' means that shock and front have the same wave speed and asymptotic states .",
    "the precise assertions of this theorem depend on the set of turning points of @xmath6 :    1 .   if @xmath6 has no turning points , then all shocks are non - conservative and fronts do not exist .",
    "2 .   for strictly convex - concave @xmath6 all conservative shocks are supersonic and",
    "satisfy the area condition . in this case theorem [ t : main ]",
    "implies that _ each _ conservative shock can be realised by an atomistic front .",
    "in particular , this allows for arbitrary large jumps between the asymptotic states and extends the bifurcation result from @xcite .",
    "3 .   for strictly concave - convex @xmath6 all conservative shocks",
    "are subsonic and theorem [ t : main ] does not imply an existence result for fronts .",
    "4 .   if @xmath6 has more than one turning point , then theorem [ t : main ] provides the existence of fronts for a proper subset of all conservative shocks .",
    "we emphasise that theorem [ t : main ] does not imply the uniqueness of fronts with prescribed asymptotic states .",
    "moreover , not every conservative shocks in the p - system corresponds to a front in the fpu chain . for functions",
    "@xmath6 with one turning point the simulations in @xcite rather suggest that only supersonic shocks allow for an atomistic realization as a ( dynamically stable ) front .",
    "this is supported by the bifurcation result in @xcite , which in fact disproves the existence of subsonic conservative shocks with small jump heights , and our results , which imply that subsonic shocks can not minimize the action , compare the discussion at the end of  [ s : main ] .",
    "we also mention the results about atomistic fronts by aubry and proville .",
    "in @xcite they study fpu chains with concave @xmath6  so all shocks in the p - system are non - conservative  and allow for atomistic fronts by adding some damping force that respects uniform motion . by numerical simulations they found oscillations in the tails of such fronts and observed that these oscillations persist when the damping tends to zero .",
    "we therefore expect that non - conservative shock data can be related to heteroclinic connections of wave trains .",
    "the proof of the first part of theorem  [ t : main ] is fairly straightforward and contained in lemma  [ lemma : jumpcond ] below .",
    "proving the second part , which is mainly contained in theorem  [ em.existencetheo ] , requires a number of preparatory steps , and uses the convexity of @xmath5 , the supersonic front speed , and the area condition in various fundamental steps . to guide the reader",
    "we give an overview of the key ideas and steps for the proof .    1",
    ".   we use the a priori knowledge of the front speed in order to reformulate the problem as a nonlinear fixed point equation for a suitably normalised profile .",
    "we identify an action functional for the deviation from the discontinuous shock profile such that the fixed point equation is the corresponding euler - lagrange equation .",
    "we use the invariance of the set of monotone profiles under the gradient flow of the lagrangian to connect stationary points in this set with fronts .",
    "4 .   we establish bounds for the action functional and use the direct approach to show that the lagrangian attains its minimum in the set of monotone profiles .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "[ s : set ] we give a more formal background for fronts and shocks of the p - system , and  [ s : main ] contains the proof of the existence result . in  [ s : qualiter ] we prove that these fronts decay exponentially to their asymptotic states ; the proof also applies to supersonic solitons with monotone tails and extends the known results there .",
    "in addition , we discuss numerical computations based on the gradient flow , and hereby illustrate the role of area condition , supersonic front speed , and energy conservation .",
    "for our purposes it is convenient to use the atomic distances @xmath8 and velocities @xmath9 as the basic variables , changing ( [ e : fpu ] ) to the system @xmath10 travelling waves are exact solutions to the infinite chain ( [ e : fpu ] ) that depend on a single phase variable @xmath11 , where the _ speed _ @xmath12 equals the phase velocity . in terms of atomic distances and velocities travelling waves can be written as @xmath13 where the profile functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 solve the advance - delay differential equations @xmath16 which imply the energy law @xmath17 the travelling waves in our context are _ fronts _ , which connect two different constant asymptotic states for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the usual function spaces on the real line .",

    "our main existence result extends this in the sense that we prove existence of fronts for any left and right states that satisfy certain constraints and can have large amplitude .    as a first result we establish necessary conditions for the existence of fronts , which reflect that each front converges to a shock in a large - scale limit .",
