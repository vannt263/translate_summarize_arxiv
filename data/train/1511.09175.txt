    "one of the motivations of this paper is to discuss some `` mysterious '' configurations of zeros of polynomials , defined by an orthogonality condition with respect to a sum of exponential functions on the plane , that appeared as a results of our numerical experiments .",
    "it turned out that in this apparently simple situation the orthogonal polynomials may exhibit a behavior which existing theoretical models do not explain , or the explanation is not straightforward . in order to make our arguments",
    "self - contained , we present a brief outline of the fundamental concepts and known results and discuss their possible generalizations .    the so - called complex or non - hermitian",
    "orthogonal polynomials with analytic weights appear in approximation theory as denominators of rational approximants to analytic functions @xcite and in the study of continued fractions .",
    "recently , non - hermitian orthogonality found applications in several new areas , for instance in the description of the rational solutions to painlev equations @xcite , in theoretical physics @xcite and in numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "observe that due to analyticity , there is a freedom in the choice of the integration contour for the non - hermitian orthogonal polynomials , which means that the location of their zeros is a priori not clear .",
    "the problem of their limit zero distribution is one of the central aspects studied in the theory of orthogonal polynomials , especially in the last few decades .",
    "several important general results in this direction have been obtained , and describing them is one of the goals of the first parts of this paper . however , the general theory is far from being complete , and many natural questions remain unanswered or have only a partial explanation , as some of the examples presented in the second part of this work will illustrate .",
    "we will deal with one of the simplest situation that is still posing many open questions .",
    "complex non - hermitian orthogonal polynomials are denominators of the diagonal pad approximants to functions with branch points and thus play a key role in the study of the asymptotic behavior of these approximants , in particular , in their convergence .",
    "since the mid - twentieth century convergence problems for pad approximants have been attracting wide interest , and consequently , complex orthogonal polynomials have become one of the central topics in analysis and approximation theory .",
    "there is a natural historical parallel of this situation with the one occurred in the middle of the ninetieth century , when pad approximants ( studied then as continued fractions ) for markov- and stieltjes - type functions led to the introduction of general orthogonal polynomials on the real line .",
    "the original fundamental theorems by p.  chebyshev , a.  markov and t.  stieltjes on the subject gave birth to the theory of general orthogonal polynomials .    in 1986 stahl @xcite proved a fundamental theorem explaining the geometry of configurations of zeros of non - hermitian orthogonal polynomials and presented an analytic description of the curves `` drawn '' by the strings of zeros .",
    "those curves are important particular cases of what we now call @xmath0-curves .",
    "they may be defined by the symmetry property of their green functions or as trajectories of some quadratic differential .",
    "the fact that the denominators of the diagonal pad approximants to an analytic function at infinity satisfy non - hermitian orthogonality relations is straightforward and was definitely known in the nineteenth century .",
    "just nobody believed that such an orthogonality could be used to study the properties pad denominators .",
    "stahl s theorem showed that complex orthogonality relations may be effectively used for these purposes , at least for functions with a `` small '' set of singular points , some of them being branch points .",
    "this , without any doubt , was a beginning of a new theory of orthogonal polynomials .    before the work of stahl , asymptotics of these polynomials was studied for some subclasses of functions and by appealing to their additional properties .",
    "for instance , several important results were obtained by gonchar @xcite and collaborators in 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s .",
    "the geometry of their zero distribution was conjectured ( and in partially proved , e.g. , for hyperelliptic functions ) by j.  nuttall and collaborators @xcite .",
    "later , in @xcite , the case when the logarithmic derivative of the approximated function is rational ( the so - called semiclassical or laguerre class ) was analyzed .",
    "the associated orthogonal polynomials , known as the semiclassical or generalized jacobi polynomials , satisfy a second - order differential equation , and the classical liouville ",
    "green ( a.k.a  wkb ) method may be used to study their strong asymptotics , as it was done by nuttall , see also a recent paper @xcite .",
    "stahl s ideas were considerably extended by gonchar and rakhmanov @xcite to cover the case when the orthogonality weight depends on the degree of the polynomial , which requires the inclusion of a non - trivial external field ( or background potential ) in the picture .",
    "the curves , describing the location of the strings of zeros of the orthogonal polynomials , feature a symmetry property ( the @xmath0-property , so we call them the @xmath0-curves ) , and their geometry is much more involved . the resulting gonchar  rakhmanov  stahl ( or grs ) theory , founded by @xcite , allows to formulate statements about the asymptotics of the zeros of complex orthogonal polynomials conditional to the existence of the @xmath0-curves , which is a non - trivial problem from the geometric function theory",
    ". further contributions in this direction , worth mentioning here , are @xcite .",
    "the notion of the @xmath0-property can be interpreted also in the light of the deift - zhou s nonlinear steepest descent method for the riemann ",
    "hilbert problems @xcite .",
    "one of the key steps in the asymptotic analysis is the deformation of the contours , the so - called lens opening , along the level sets of certain functions .",
    "it is precisely the @xmath0-property of these sets which guarantees that the contribution on all non - relevant contours becomes asymptotically negligible .",
    "an important further development was a systematic investigation of the critical measures , presented in @xcite .",
    "critical measures are a wider class that encompasses the equilibrium measures on @xmath0-curves , see sect .  [ sec : grs ] for the precise definition and further details .",
    "one of the contributions of @xcite was the description of their supports in terms of trajectories of certain quadratic differentials ( this description for the equilibrium measures with the @xmath0-property is originally due to stahl @xcite ) . in this way",
    ", the problem of existence of the appropriate @xmath0-curves is reduced to the question about the global structure of such trajectories .",
    "let us finish by describing the content of this paper .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] is a showcase of some zero configurations of polynomials of complex orthogonality , appearing in different settings .",
    "the presentation is mostly informal , it relies on some numerical experiments , and its goal is mainly to illustrate the situation and eventually to arouse the reader s curiosity .",
    "[ sec : logpotential ] contains a brief overview of some basic definitions from the logarithmic potential theory , necessary for the subsequent discussion , as well as some simple applications of these notions to polynomials .",
    "this section is essentially introductory , and a knowledgeable reader may skip it safely .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : grs ] we present the known basic theorem on asymptotics of complex orthogonal polynomials .",
    "we simplify settings as much as possible without losing essential content .",
    "the definitions and results contained here constitute the core of what we call the _",
    "grs theory_. altogether , sects .  [ sec : examples][sec : grs ] are expository .    finally , in sections  [ subsec6.7 ] and [ sec:6 ] we present some recent or totally new results . for instance",
    ", section  [ subsec6.7 ] is about the so - called vector critical measures , which find applications in the analysis of the hermite ",
    "pad approximants of the second kind for a couple of power series at infinity of a special form , as well as in the study of the problems tackled in sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] .",
    "this last section of the paper deals with the orthogonality with respect to _ a sum _ of two ( or more ) analytic weights . in order to build some intuition",
    ", we present another set of curious numerical results in sect .",
    "[ sec : numerical experiments ] , and the title of this paper ( partially borrowed from philip k.  dick ) is motivated by the amazing variety and beauty of possible configurations . as the analysis of these experiments shows even for the simplest model , corresponding to the sum of two exponential weights , in some domain in the parameter space of the problem the standard grs theory still explains the observed behavior , while in other domains it needs to be modified or adapted , which leads to some new equilibrium problems",
    ". finally , there are regions in the parameter space where it is not yet clear how to generalize the grs theory to explain our numerical results , and we can not go beyond an empirical discussion .",
    "we start by presenting some motivating examples that should illustrate the choice of the title of this work .",
    "pad approximants @xcite are the _ locally best rational approximants of a power series _ ; in a broader sense , they are constructive rational approximants _ with free poles_.    let @xmath1 denote the set of algebraic polynomials with complex coefficients and degree @xmath2 , and let @xmath3 be a ( formal ) power series .",
    "for any arbitrary non - negative integer @xmath4 there always exist polynomials  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 , @xmath7 , satisfying the condition @xmath8 this equation is again formal and means that @xmath9 ( called the _ remainder _ ) is a power series in descending powers of  @xmath10 , starting at least at @xmath11 . in order to find polynomials  @xmath12 and @xmath13 we first use condition to determine the coefficients of @xmath13 , after which @xmath12 is just the truncation of @xmath14 at the terms of nonnegative degree .",
    "it is easy to see that condition does not determine the pair @xmath15 uniquely .",
    "nevertheless , the corresponding rational function @xmath16 is unique , and it is known as the _ ( diagonal ) pad approximant to @xmath17 at @xmath18 of degree @xmath4_.    hence , the denominator @xmath13 is the central object in the construction of diagonal pad approximants , and its poles constitute the main obstruction to convergence of @xmath19 in a domain of the complex plane @xmath20 .    with this definition we can associate a formal orthogonality verified by the denominators @xmath13 ( see , e.g. , a recent survey @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "however , the most interesting theory is developed when @xmath17 is an analytic germ at infinity .",
    "indeed , if converges for @xmath21 , then choosing a jordan closed curve @xmath22 in @xmath23 and using the cauchy theorem we conclude that @xmath24 this condition is an example of a _ non - hermitian orthogonality _",
    "satisfied by the denominators @xmath13 .    in particular interesting",
    "is the case when @xmath17 corresponds to an algebraic ( multivalued ) function , being approximated by intrinsically single - valued rational functions @xmath19 . as an illustration we plot in figure  [ fig1pade ] the poles of @xmath25 for the analytic germs at infinity of two functions , @xmath26 both normalized by @xmath27 .",
    "these functions belong to the so - called laguerre class ( or are also known as `` semiclassical '' ) : their logarithmic derivatives are rational functions .",
    "cc    fig1a    &    fig1b    a quick examination of the pictures puts forward two phenomena :    1 .",
    "generally , poles of @xmath19 distribute on @xmath20 in a rather regular way .",
    "our eye can not avoid `` drawing '' curves along which the zeros align almost perfectly .",
    "2 .   there are some exceptions to this beautiful order : observe a clear outlier on figure  [ fig1pade ] , right .",
    "these `` outliers '' are known as the _ spurious poles _ of the pad approximants .",
    "this is the `` most classical '' family of polynomials , which includes the chebyshev polynomials as a particular case .",
    "they can be defined explicitly ( see @xcite ) , @xmath28 or , equivalently , by the well - known rodrigues formula @xmath29 .\\ ] ]    incidentally , jacobi polynomials could have been considered in the previous section : for @xmath30 they are also denominators of the diagonal pad approximants ( at infinity ) to the function @xmath31 in fact , denominators of the diagonal pad approximants to semiclassical functions as in are known as _ generalized jacobi polynomials _ , see @xcite .    clearly , polynomials @xmath32 are entire functions of the complex parameters @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath30 they are orthogonal on @xmath34 $ ] with respect to the positive weight @xmath35 , @xmath36 and in consequence their zeros are all real , simple , and belong to @xmath37 .    what happens if at least one of the parameters @xmath38 is `` non - classical '' ? in  figure  [ fig : onlyzeros ] we depicted the zeros of @xmath32 for @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we can appreciate again the same feature : a very regular distribution of the zeros along certain imaginary lines on the plane .",
    "fig2(29,31)@xmath42 ( 68,33)@xmath43      these are a natural generalization of the jacobi polynomials . given a set of pairwise distinct points fixed on the complex plane @xmath20 , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , and two polynomials , @xmath46 we are interested in the polynomial solutions of the _ generalized lam differential _ equation ( in algebraic form ) , @xmath47 where @xmath48 ; if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 is monic .",
    "an alternative perspective on the same problem can be stated in terms of the second order differential operator @xmath51(z ) : = a(z)\\ , y''(z)+ b(z)\\ , y'(z),\\ ] ] and the associated generalized spectral problem ( or multiparameter eigenvalue problem , see @xcite ) , @xmath52(z)=n(n+\\alpha -1 ) v_n(z)\\ , y(z)\\ , , \\quad   n \\in { \\mathbb{n}},\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the `` spectral polynomial '' .",
    "if we take @xmath54 in , we are back in the case of jacobi polynomials ( hypergeometric differential equation ) . for @xmath55",
    "we get the heun s equation , which still attracts interest and poses open questions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , denominators of pad approximants for semiclassical functions are also heine  stieltjes polynomials , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "heine @xcite proved that for every @xmath56 there exist at most @xmath57 different polynomials @xmath58 such that ( or ) admits a polynomial solution @xmath59 .",
    "these particular @xmath58 are called _ van vleck polynomials _ , and the corresponding polynomial solutions @xmath60 are known as _ heine - stieltjes _ ( or simply stieltjes ) polynomials ; see @xcite for further details ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zeroshs ] ) .",
    "fig3    stieltjes discovered an electrostatic interpretation of zeros of the polynomials discussed in @xcite , which attracted general attention to the problem .",
    "he studied the problem in a particular setting , assuming that @xmath61 and that all residues @xmath62 in @xmath63 are strictly positive ( which is equivalent to the assumption that the zeros of @xmath64 alternate with those of @xmath65 and that the leading coefficient of @xmath65 is positive ) .",

    "now we step into a new territory .",
    "it is well known that a multiplicative modification of an orthogonality measure is easier to handle ( from the point of view of the asymptotic theory ) than an additive one . however",

    "in some range the solution is essentially known ; there is another parameters domain where a modification of known methods make it possible to prove a theorem on the zero distribution by generalizing known results . in particular",
    "a new equilibrium problem has to be introduced in order to present these generalizations .",
    "finally , there is a `` gray area '' in the space of parameters , where we can only show some results of numerical experiments and to state partial conjectures explaining those results .",

    "the integral in resembles , at least formally , the orthogonality conditions in , so it is natural to analyze first the applicability of the grs theory , explained in section  [ sec : grs ] .",
    "the starting assumption is that the weights @xmath327 in must be analytic in a domain @xmath160 that contains points @xmath328 , where the following limit exists : @xmath329 notice that in the original paper @xcite the convergence in the above formula was assumed to be uniform on compacts in @xmath160 , and consequently the function @xmath191 was harmonic in @xmath160 .",
    "these assumption need to be relaxed for our purposes .",

    "the @xmath0-property is no longer valid : it does hold for the external field @xmath354 , but not for ! what happens next is shown in figure  [ figexamplesaffconf ] , top right .",
