    "galaxies are gregarious systems , most of them are gathered in groups or clusters , while only 30% are isolated and 10% are binaries in the field .",
    "nevertheless compact groups ( cg ) are quite rare and according to hickson s classification ( hickson , 1982 ) only 0.1 % of galaxies belong to cgs .",
    "criteria of population ( initially four galaxies in the group ) , isolation ( dynamically independent systems ) and compactness ( separation between galaxies comparable to the sizes of the galaxies ) are chosen by hickson to build his catalog . with these criteria around one hundred cgs were found on the palomar observatory sky survey red prints .",
    "compact groups are ideal sites to study the influence of strong dynamical evolution due to environment on molecular cloud formation and star formation efficiency .",
    "they appear in projection as the densest galaxy systems known , even denser than the cores of rich clusters , and they show multiple signs of interactions . due to their high density , and relatively small velocity dispersion , these systems are unstable with regard to merging instability .",
    "the dynamical friction time - scale is of the order of 2.10@xmath0 yrs , and n - body simulations predict their rapid evolution towards a single elliptical massive galaxy ( e.g. barnes 1989 ) .",
    "the existence of many such compact groups is therefore a puzzle , and the physical reality of hcg has been questioned ( e.g. mamon 1986 , 1987 ) ; but evidence of galaxy - galaxy interactions in those groups , either morphologic ( hickson 1990 ; mendes de oliveira 1992 ) , or kinematic ( rubin et al . 1991 ) , speaks in favour of their reality .",
    "latest spectroscopic observations showed that 92 of the original 100 groups have at least three galaxies with recession velocities within 1000 of each other ( hickson et al .",
    "the presence of hot intergalactic gas , detected by x - ray emission centered on some hcgs , is a further confirmation of the existence of these compact groups ( pildis et al .",
    "1995 , ponman et al .",
    "+ most of galaxies that belong to groups are in fact in loose groups of 10 - 30 galaxies and about 50% of all galaxies belong to loose groups .",
    "but loose groups are in their great majority un - bound and un - virialised ( gourgoulhon et al .",
    "1992 ) while their true dynamical state is ambiguous ( expanding , collapsing , transient ) . clusters of galaxies are more near equilibrium , specially in their centers ( about 10% of all galaxies belong to clusters )",
    ". however , the depth of their potential well leads to high relative velocities between galaxies that reduce the efficiency of galaxy - galaxy encounters .",
    "the influence of environment is revealed by the high proportion of ellipticals and lenticulars , and by the hi gas deficiency of spirals ( dressler 1984 , cayatte et al .",
    "this gas deficiency can be explained by ram - pressure as well as tidal interactions ( combes et al .",
    "no molecular gas deficiency has been detected , either in virgo ( kenney & young 1988 ) , or in coma ( casoli et al . 1991 ) , which suggests that the inner parts of the galaxies are not affected by their environment , since the co emission essentially comes from the galaxy central regions .",
    "however , there could be two compensating effects at play here : the enhancement of co emission in interacting galaxies ( cf braine et combes 1993 , combes et al .",
    "1994 ) , and the outer gas stripping , stopping the gas fueling of galaxies .",
    "+ in compact groups , some hi deficiency has also been reported ( williams & rood 1987 ) , but no co emission deficiency , according to a first study by boselli et al ( 1996 ) with the sest telescope .",
    "it is further interesting to investigate whether hcgs are actually sampling the highest densities of galaxies in the universe .",
    "it has been claimed that , even if the cgs are real , we are not sure of their high density , since they could correspond to loose groups with only a high _ projected _ density through chance alignment of filaments along the line of sight ( e.g. mamon 1992 ) .",
    "but no loose groups are observed in hcg neighborhood in the majority ( 67% ) of cases ( rood & williams 1989 ) .",
    "hickson ( 1982 ) found that the groups contain fewer spirals than a comparable sample of field galaxies .",
    "the spiral fraction decreases from 60% in the least compact groups to 20% in the most compact .",
    "there is also a deficiency of faint galaxies with respect to rich clusters and field .",
    "this apparent deficiency is more severe in groups with elliptical first - ranked galaxies .",
    "radio properties of compact groups have been studied by menon & hickson ( 1985 ) and menon ( 1991 , 1995 ) .",
    "although the far - infrared and radio luminosities are still highly correlated as for field galaxies , the total radio emission from hcg spirals is relatively lower by a factor 2 in compact group galaxies while the nuclear radio emission is enhanced by a factor of about 10 compared to isolated galaxies .",
    "the results suggest a scenario in which interactions among group galaxies produce inflow of gas towards the centers , elevating the star formation there , and consequently the radio and far - infrared emissions .",
    "but at the same time the removal of gas and magnetic fields from the extended disks of the galaxies results in a decrease of total radio - emission .",
    "williams & rood ( 1987 ) have observed 51 of the 100 hickson groups in the hi line , and detected 34 of them .",
    "they find that on average a hickson compact group contains half as much neutral hydrogen as a loose group with a similar distribution of galaxy luminosities and morphological types .",
    "this result supports the reality of compact groups as independent dynamical systems and not transient or projected configurations in loose groups .",
    "the recent rosat survey of hcgs by ponman et al ( 1996 ) also confirms that the groups are intrinsically compact , and not the projection of loose groups .",
    "they infer that more than 75% of the hcgs possess hot intragroup gas . + we present here a large co survey of hickson group galaxies with the iram 30 m telescope , and compare the relative gas content and star formation efficiency of cg galaxies with other samples belonging to widely different environments .",
    "after describing the observations in section 2 , the sample and the data in section 3 , we discuss the main conclusions and possible interpretations in section 4 .",
    "observations were carried out on 4 - 10 september 1995 with the 30 meter radiotelescope of the instituto de radio astronomia milimetrica ( iram ) in pico veleta , near granada in spain .",
    "single - sideband sis receivers were tuned for the and transitions at respectively 115 and 230 ghz .",
    "weather conditions were excellent during the run with typical effective system temperatures of 300 - 400 k (  scale ) at 115 ghz and 500 - 800 k (  scale ) at 230 ghz .",

    "we assume a hpbw of 22@xmath2 and 11@xmath3 respectively .",
    "pointing was done frequently on continuum sources with corrections of the offsets up to 8@xmath3 , providing an accuracy of 3@xmath4 ( greve et al , 1996 ) .",
    "+ the temperature - scale calibration was checked on the sources w3oh , oria and irc+10216 ( mauersberger et al .",
    "1989 ) ; except for a transient problem for the 3 mm calibration , it remained in a reasonable range providing at least a 20% calibration accuracy .",
    "we use the wobbler with a switch cycle of 4 seconds and a beam throw of 90 - 240@xmath5 avoiding off position on another galaxy of the same compact group .",
    "each 12 minutes a chopper wheel calibration was performed on a load at ambient temperature and on a cold load ( 77 k ) .",
    "the line temperatures are expressed in the  scale , antenna temperature corrected for atmospheric attenuation and rear sidelobes .",
    "baselines were flat allowing us to subtract only linear polynomials out of the spectra .",
    "our observed sample is composed of 70 galaxies towards 45 compact groups , taken from the catalog of hickson compact groups ( hcg , hickson 1982 ) .",
    "we discarded afterwards 4 galaxies ( 11a,19b,73a,78a ) which appear not to belong to compact groups ( hickson , 1992 ) .",

[ plot_completude ] .",
    "[ plot_cf_simul ] shows the result where it appears that the malmquist bias in our sample , spread over a large distance range , can explain part of the apparent enhancement of molecular gas in the hggs .",
    "however the control sample , assumed to be complete , is not likely to be so for the low values of @xmath23 where the samples are the most different .",
    "similarly the @xmath24 distribution is affected by the malmquist bias ( verter , 1993 ) , but the point is that the cumulative distribution is lower than the control distribution on the whole range of variation up to higher values , leading to a suggestion of a real enhancement of the dust material in the hcgs .",
    "the close correlation between dust and molecular gas suggests that the  content is really enhanced in the hcgs . _ as it has been shown previously , that enhancement is only significant for the most compact groups in their merging phase , confusing somewhat the question of molecular gas enhancement in the whole hcg sample .",
    "_      what can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fir - h2-sfe - hi](a ) is the large dispersion of the sfe as defined by the /  ratio : a large number of galaxies are deficient in co emission , leading to a depressed /  ratio and large sfe .",
    "this large dispersion is mainly due to the dwarf and elliptical samples , but also to small galaxies in the control sample ; we have checked that the objects with high sfe at moderate /  have a lower  than average .",
    "this phenomenon disappears when the total gas content is considered instead of the mere h@xmath25 content , as shown in fig [ fir - h2-sfe - hi](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "it is striking that the total normalised gas content is almost a constant , independent of /.",
    "there is one exception for the cluster population where the stripping of the neutral and molecular content is at play .",
    "we find a deficiency of the molecular content in these galaxies , which seems related to a lower  luminosity ( horellou et al .",
    "all that suggests the importance of  in star formation as a source of fueling , through the conversion @xmath26 , and the higher reliability of the star formation indicator /(+ ) .",
    "a least square fit yields the relation @xmath27 for all the samples gathered .",
    "the good correlation between the normalised  and  could be in a large part due to the dependence of both quantities on the metallicity and temperature of the interstellar medium .",
    "it is now well established that the co to h@xmath25 conversion ratio is strongly dependent on metallicity ( e.g. rubio et al 1993 ) , as well as the dust - to - gas ratio ( and therefore the fir luminosity ) . as shown on fig .",
    "[ df_ratio ] , all the cumulative distributions for the molecular gas - to - dust ratio are highly correlated , (: all , except dwarf and elliptic samples , @xmath28 6 .",
    "( probability @xmath29 0.54 ) ) . while the dependence of  on temperature is direct , that of the co emission is more complex",
    ". low brightness temperatures of the co lines are obtained either for cold gas , or diffuse gas ; the rotational levels of the molecule are excited by collision , and diffuse molecular clouds are generally sub - thermal .",
    "the use of a standard co to h@xmath25 conversion ratio is then problematic . for thermalised dense gas",
    "however , the co emission is directly proportional to the gas temperature . the metal abundance and the gas recycling",
    "are closely related to the imf and evolution of the mf .",
    "high mass stars ( m@xmath30 ) are active on short time scales ( @xmath31 yrs ) whereas low mass stars have an influence on much longer time scales ( vigroux et al .",
    "thus the co abundance is very dependent on the star formation rate , and the co/  conversion ratio could be very variable , particularly for galaxies with recent star formation episodes ( e.g. casoli et al 1992 , henkel & mauersberger 1993 ) .      given the enhancement in co emission detected in hcg with respect to a control sample and the strong correlation between the radio continuum , co and the fir for hcg spirals it would appear that the lack of enhancement of the total fir emission in hcg galaxies is due to lack of spatial resolution of iras measurements .",
    "this is particularly important if the fir is mainly enhanced in the central regions of the galaxies .",
    "iso observations might allow to check this assertion .",
    "the consequence of an enhanced  without fir enhancement is a lower star forming efficiency for hcg , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ df_fir ] .",
    "this property might appear surprising , but disappears when the total gas content is taken into account ( this result should be taken with caution , since only 14 galaxies have a well - defined  content in our hcg sample ) .",
    "[ td ]    we have tested the correlations of the star formation indicators , with and without account of the atomic phase , with the dust temperature , in fig . [ survey_td ] .",
    "both quantities correlate well with : for all samples together we find a relationship flatter than young et al .",

    "devereux & young ( 1990 ) emphasized that high mass ( @xmath29 6 ) o and b stars are responsible for high  ( @xmath36 ) and h@xmath37 luminosities , advocating a two - component model : one dust component heated by high mass stars ( @xmath38 50 - 60 k ) and the other heated by the interstellar radiation field ( @xmath38 16 - 20 k ) .",
    "the low mean temperature of the hcg sample ( @xmath39 33 k ) suggests that the  luminosity is coming from an important quiescent molecular phase , together with the `` cirrus '' phase associated with diffuse atomic hydrogen .",
    "it could explain why the _ global _ luminosity does not fit with a high star formation population , without excluding star formation towards the center , as revealed by radio continuum .",
    "in a recent study , lisenfeld et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find the same /@xmath40  ratio for starburst interacting and normal galaxies . from this",
    ", we could infer that the enhanced radio continuum emission from the center of hcg galaxies should be accompanied with an enhanced central fir luminosity .",
    "the constancy of the /@xmath40  ratio has been interpreted as being due to a strong and fast ( @xmath41 yrs ) increase of the magnetic field at the beginning of the starburst , together with a time - scale of variation of the star - formation rate longer than some @xmath41 yrs .",
    "the enhancement of the  content in the most compact groups suggests that tidal interactions in hcg are efficient in driving the gas inwards .",
    "this is also a confirmation that at least some groups are actually compact and not only projections along the line of sight .",
    "these very compact groups should merge through dynamical friction on a short time scale ( a few @xmath42 yrs , cf barnes 1989 ) .",
    "a conclusion from the present work is that the most compact of these groups have concentrated an important amount of molecular gas without initiating yet important star formation .",
    "however they must correspond to a short duration phase just before merging and enhanced star - formation .",
    "it is tempting to identify the next phase of this process to the ultra luminous infra red galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "the latter have their infrared luminosity powered by massive star formation ( lutz et al .",
    "1996 ) with an important consumption of molecular gas .",
    "sanders et al ( 1988 ) have shown that many ulirgs are interacting / merging galaxies ; recently clements & baker ( 1996 ) extended that to the vast majority of the ulirgs sample .",
    "some of these systems , with luminous masses ranging up to few @xmath43 , should represent the remnant of some compact group which has undertaken multiple mergers on a very short time - scale ( @xmath44 yrs ) .",
    "the fir luminosity of the final ulirgs should be a function of the spiral fraction in the parent group , the most powerful ulirgs being the result of the merging of typically four gas - rich spirals .",
    "as pointed out earlier the spatial distribution of interstellar matter within galaxies will play an important role in the rate of fuelling of starbursts during interactions .",
    "but does the expected rate of ulirgs formation via cg merging match the presently observed frequency of these objects ?",
    "the answer is very uncertain , since the actual fraction of very compact groups , on the point of merging , is not known .",
    "this fraction can not be close to 1 , since there would be too large a discrepancy between the expected and observed number of ultra luminous galaxies and their remnants ( e.g. williams & rood 1987 , sulentic & rabaa 1994 ) .",
    "simulations of galaxy formation and large - scale structures evolution have suggested that some of the cgs could be filaments of galaxies seen end - on ( hernquist et al .",
    "this idea has been studied further by pildis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) : if it is true that galaxies that will form a compact group spend a large fraction of their time first in a filament , this filament will appear as a cg in projection only for less than 20% of cases .",
    "then the galaxies will fall into a real cg , and this phase corresponds to at least 30% of their lifetime . although these figures are model dependent , they suggest that the majority of hcg in the sky are physically compact groups",
    ". the time - scale of merging can then depend highly on initial conditions , and in particular on the elliptical fraction , which may alleviate the over - merging problem ( e.g. governato et al .",
    "1991 , garcia - gomez et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the threshold in mean galaxy separation for the enhancement of suggests that it corresponds to the last stage of the life of the compact group , when each galaxy is undertaking frequent and strong tidal effects . in fig .",
    "[ histo_sepa ] we plot the histogram of the mean projected separation of the whole sample of hcgs from hickson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) : there is a significant cut - off at short separation at approximatively 20 - 30 kpc , which must correspond to a short life time for very compact configurations .",
    "we suggest that this cut - off corresponds to the acceleration of the merging process , and at the same time to significant inward gas flows , that account for our observations .",
    "dynamically , such an exponential acceleration of the collapse is predicted by simulations and analytic models of satellite decay through dynamical friction ( see for example leeuwin & combes 1997 ) .",
    "this rapid acceleration has been interpreted through the excitation of numerous high - order resonances for a satellite at about twice the primary radius ( e.g. tremaine & weinberg 1984 ) .",
    "from our survey of co emission in 70 galaxies belonging to 45 hickson compact groups , we have detected 57 objects .",
    "we find in average that the gas and dust contents /  and /  show evidence of enhancement with respect to our control sample .",
    "this result however is somewhat weakened due to the malmquist bias in our sample .",
    "for the most compact groups the enhancement is more clear . on the contrary",
    ", the global far - infrared flux does not appear to be enhanced with respect to the control sample .",
    "the fir and  distribution indicates that the fir luminosity is coming essentially from a cold dust component heated by the interstellar radiation field . from the general correlation between fir and radio contiuum power we suggest that only the very centers of some groups are experiencing star formation and are sites of enhanced fir emission . iras spatial resolution is not sufficient to show this directly .",
    "statistical tests show that the hcg gas and dust contents are closer to that of pair and starburst galaxies , revealing the efficiency of tidal interactions in driving the gas inwards in compact group galaxies .",
    "we find a stronger  enhancement for the cgs having a short mean separation ( @xmath45 kpc ) .",
    "we suggest that these most compact , high-  content groups , may be in a final merging phase , just before the starburst phase , that will lead them in a very short time - scale to the ulirgs category .",
    "+ the comparison of the various samples suggest that the _ total _ gas content ( + ) should be taken into account to estimate the star formation efficiency",

    "<S> we have observed 70 galaxies belonging to 45 hickson compact groups in the and lines , in order to determine their molecular content . </S>",
    "<S> we detected 57 galaxies , corresponding to a detection rate of 81% . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the gas content relative to blue and  luminosities of galaxies in compact groups with respect to other samples in the literature , including various environments and morphological types . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is some hint of enhanced /  and /  ratios in the galaxies from compact group with respect to our control sample , especially for the most compact groups , suggesting that tidal interactions can drive the gas component inwards , by removing its angular momentum , and concentrating it in the dense central regions , where it is easily detected . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular gas content in compact group galaxies is similar to that in pairs and starburst samples . </S>",
    "<S> however , the total  luminosity of hcgs is quite similar to that of the control sample , and therefore the star formation efficiency appears lower than in the control galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however this assumes that the fir spatial distributions are similar in both samples which is not the case at radio frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> higher spatial resolution fir data are needed to make a valid comparison . given their short dynamical friction time - scale , it is possible that some of these systems are in the final stage before merging , leading to ultra - luminous starburst phases . </S>",
    "<S> we also find for all galaxy samples that the  content ( derived from co luminosity and normalised to blue luminosity ) is strongly correlated to the  luminosity , while the total gas content ( + ) is not . </S>"
