    "in heavy ion collisions , if the beam energy is high enough , the following scenario can be envisaged . for a general impact parameter ,",
    "part of the projectile will overlap with part of the target .",
    "this is the participant region where violent collisions occur .",
    "in addition there are two mildly excited remnants : projectile like fragment ( plf ) , with rapidity close to that of the projectile rapidity and target like fragment ( tlf ) with rapidity near zero .",
    "the plf has been studied experimentally , this being one of the tools for production and identification of exotic nuclei .",
    "the plf has mild excitation and breaks up into many composites .",
    "extensive measurements of cross - sections of composites arising from the break up of plf of ni on be and ta were made at michigan state university@xcite .",
    "powerful and elaborate calculations for the case of ni on be were made recently using transport model@xcite .",
    "unfortunately calculations for ni on ta could not be done because this becomes prohibitively large .",
    "one of the main reasons of this venture was to examine if an alternate , less ambitious but realistic model , could be used to calculate results for the case of ni on ta .",
    "it appears that above a certain beam energy the model will be in general applicable and is implementable .",
    "great progress has been made in phenomenological epax @xcite model which predicts results for cross - sections .",
    "our model , we believe is less phenomenological . it is grounded in traditional concepts of heavy ion reaction plus by now , well - known model of multifragmentation .",
    "we describe the basics of the model below .",
    "imagine that the beam energy is high enough so that using straight line trajectories one can uniquely define participant , plf and tlf .",
    "a certain fraction of the projectile is lost in the participant .",
    "this can be calculated .",
    "what remains of the projectile is the plf , moving with velocity close to the beam velocity .",
    "there is a probability of having n neutrons and z protons in the plf .",
    "this probability @xmath0 depends upon the impact parameter .",
    "we call this abrasion .",
    "the abrasion cross - section when there are @xmath1 neutrons and @xmath2 protons in the plf is labelled by @xmath3 : @xmath4 this is stage 1 of the calculation .",
    "an abraded system with @xmath1 neutrons and @xmath2 protons has excitation .",
    "we characterise this by a temperature @xmath5 instead .",
    "this will expand and break up into many excited composites and nucleons .",
    "this break up is calculated using a canonical thermodynamic model(ctm ) @xcite .",
    "the cross - section at this stage is called @xmath6 .",
    "this is the second stage of the calculation .",
    "this second stage can be replaced by another statistical multifragmentation model(smm ) @xcite but the results are expected to be very similar @xcite .",
    "lastly we consider composites after stage 2 .",
    "these have a temperature and can evaporate light particles like neutrons , protons , alphas etc .",
    "this can deplete a nucleus with neutron and proton numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 that was obtained after stage 2 but there is a compensation also by feeding from higher mass nuclei .",
    "consider the abraison stage .",
    "the projectile hits the target .",
    "use straightline geometry .",
    "we can then calculate the volume of the projectile that goes into the participant region ( eqs . a.4.4 and a.4.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "what remains in the plf is @xmath9 .",
    "this is a function of @xmath10 , the impact parameter .",
    "if the original volume of the projectile is @xmath11 , the original number of neutrons is @xmath12 and the original number of protons is @xmath13 then the average number of neutrons in the plf is @xmath14 and the average number of protons is @xmath15",
    ". these will usually be non - integers . since in any event only integral numbers for neutrons and protons can materialise in the plf , we have to guess what is the distribution of @xmath16 which produces these average values .",
    "two distributions immediately come to mind .",
    "one is a minimal distribution model .",
    "let @xmath17 where @xmath18 is less than 1 .",
    "we can also define @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 is zero unless @xmath21 is @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "the distribution is narrow .",
    "we then get @xmath24 and @xmath25 . from @xmath26",
    "we can similarly define @xmath27 .",
    "together now we write @xmath28 .",
    "this is the @xmath0 of the previous section(eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "the alternative is a binomial distribution which has a long tail .",
    "now @xmath20 is defined by @xmath29 ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    "similarly we can define @xmath27 for binomial distribution .",
    "we can take @xmath31",
    ". the binomial distribution would be appropriate if the projectile is viewed as a collection of non - interacting neutron and proton gas with constant density throughout its volume .",
    "this is oversimplification and we find the binomial distribution is too long tailed .",
    "for very peripheral collision ( with only 1 or 2 nucleons lost to the participant ) the temperature of the plf should be nearly zero and and @xmath3 can be directly confronted with data .",
    "the calculation gives a far too wide distribution .",
    "the same test applied to the minimal distribution model shows that it errs on being too narrow .",
    "here we show results calculated with minimal distribution which is easier to work with .",
    "the limits of integration in eq.(1 ) are @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for @xmath32",
    "we have either 0 ( if the projectile is larger than the target ) or @xmath34 ( if the target is larger than the projectile , in this case at lower value of @xmath10 there is no plf left ) . in evaluating eq.(1 )",
    "we replace integration by a sum .",
    "the cross - sectional area between @xmath32 and @xmath35 is divided into @xmath36 rings of equal cross - sections and @xmath0 is evaluated at midpoints between radii of successive rings . for ni on",
    "be we use @xmath36=20 , for ni on ta we use @xmath36=100 and for xe on al we use @xmath36=200 .",
    "now we come to the second stage of the calculation .",
    "the abraded system of @xmath16 nucleons will have an excitation which we characterize by a temperature @xmath5 .",
    "previous experiences with projectile fragmentation lead us to expect a temperature around 5 mev . in this work we fix the temperature from a fit to the data .",
    "this will be explained soon .",
    "the excitation and hence the temperature of the abraded system owes its origin to several factors : deviation from spherical shape when abrasion happens : migration of nucleons from the participant zone etc .. estimating the temperature from a more basic calculation is beyond the scope of this model .",
    "the abraded system with @xmath16 and a temperature @xmath5 will break up into many composites and nucleons .",
    "we use the canonical thermodynamic model ( ctm ) to calculate this break up . as this",
    "has been described many times @xcite we merely specify the composites it can break into .",
    "it can break up into neutrons , protons,@xmath37h ground state,@xmath38h ground state , @xmath38he ground state , @xmath39he ground state and heavier nuclei in ground and excited states . for these heavier nuclei",
    "the following approach is taken .",
    "we use the liquid drop mass formula which defines neutron and proton drip lines .",
    "all nuclei within drip lines are included .",
    "excited states of these nuclei are included using a density of states derived from a fermi - gas model .",
    "the hot abraded system expands .",
    "the dissociation into various nuclei according to thermodynamics is calculated at this larger volume .",
    "although a range of freeze - out volumes were considered we show only results for freeze - out volume @xmath40 where @xmath11 is the normal nuclear volume .",
    "a larger volume is normally used for break up of the participant zone but for disintegration of plf the value 3@xmath11 was used in the past with good success @xcite .",
    "if we have , after abrasion , a system @xmath16 at temperature @xmath5 , ctm allows us to compute the average population of the composite with neutron number @xmath7 and proton number @xmath8 when this system breaks up .",
    "denote this by @xmath41 .",
    "it then follows summing over all the abraded @xmath16 that can yield @xmath42 the primary cross - section for @xmath42 is @xmath43 this finishes stage 2 of the calculation .",
    "the composite @xmath42 obtained after ctm is at temperature @xmath5 .",
    "it can @xmath44-decay to shed its energy but may also decay by light particle emission to lower mass nuclei . on the other hand some higher mass nuclei can decay to this composite .",
    "we include emissions of @xmath45he and @xmath39he .",
    "particle decay widths are obtained using the weisskopf s evaporation theory @xcite .",
    "fission is also included as a de - excitation channel though for the nuclei of mass @xmath46 100 its role will be quite insignificant .",
    "once the emission widths ( @xmath47 s ) are known , it is required to establish the emission algorithm which decides whether a particle is being emitted from the compound nucleus .",
    "this is done @xcite by first calculating the ratio @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 or fission and then performing monte - carlo sampling from a uniformly distributed set of random numbers . in the case that a particle is emitted , the type of the emitted particle is next decided by a monte carlo selection with the weights @xmath52 ( partial widths ) .",
    "the energy of the emitted particle is then obtained by another monte carlo sampling of its energy spectrum .",
    "the energy , mass and charge of the nucleus is adjusted after each emission and the entire procedure is repeated until the resulting products are unable to undergo further decay .",
    "this procedure is followed for each of the primary fragment produced at a fixed temperature and then repeated over a large ensemble and the observables are calculated from the ensemble averages . the number and type of particles emitted and the final decay product in each event is registered and are taken into account properly keeping in mind the overall charge and baryon number conservation .",
    "this is the third and last stage of the calculation .",
    "the details of how we do this are given in @xcite .",
    "there is one parameter in the model : the temperature @xmath5 . as already mentioned",
    ": there are at least two reasons why the plf has an excitation .",
    "the abraded remnant did not start with a spherical shape and one expects some migration from the participant . without a calculation at a more fundamental level it is not possible to calculate the excitation .",
    "we do not deal with excitation energy as such and characterise the system by a temperature @xmath5 .",
    "it is expected that the temperature should be fairly constant as a function of the impact parameter @xmath10 ( see also @xcite ) except for very peripheral collisions where it will rapidly drop to zero . to keep the model as parameter free as possible we use one temperature for all @xmath10 .",
    "there is a price to pay . for very peripheral collisions ( loss of only one or two nucleons to participants ) we can not expect reasonable results .",
    "we will demonstrate this later .",
    "the projectile - target combinations we have chosen highlight different aspects . consider ni on be .",
    "the projectile is significantly larger than the target .",
    "in such a case , the abraded projectile has a lower limit on @xmath16 ( as be can drive out only some nucleons , not all ) . for @xmath53ni on",
    "be the abraded projectile fragment has , on the average 22 neutrons and 17 protons for @xmath54 ( for larger impact parameter @xmath10 it can have more neutrons and protons but not less ) .",
    "but significant cross - sections exist for composites with z=8,9,10 etc .",
    "these therefore must arise from canonical model break - up ( stage 2 ) of an abraded system ( stage 1 ) . on the other hand for ni on ta ( projectile smaller than target )",
    "the abraded system itself covers most of the range of composites seen in the experiment .",
    "the role of the second stage ( eq.(2 ) ) is to modify the cross - sections .",
    "the case of @xmath55xe on al highlights another aspect . here",
    "the abraded systems are very neutron rich and must shed many neutrons ( stage 2 ) before comparison with experiment can be done .    for the case of xe on al at 790 mev / nucleon obvious arguments can be given for defining participants and spectators using straightline geometry . at 140 mev / nucleon ( ni on be and ta ) we are probably near the lower limit where this is still an acceptable approximation . an interesting question is : do we expect the same temperature .",
    "we fix the temperature from a fit to the experimental cross - sections .",
    "as there are many many cross - sections , for fixing the temperature we examine calculated and experimental values of summed cross - sections : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we find that both for ni on be and ta at 140 mev / nucleon and for xe on al at 790 mev / nucleon we are led to a value of @xmath58 mev .",
    "results are given in the following sections .",
    "at bevalac where experiments were at higher energies , straight line geometry was used to define participants and spectators down to 250 mev/ nucleon , the lowest energy for which data are available @xcite .",
    "we compute total charge cross - sections @xmath59 and total mass cross - sections @xmath60 and compare with data for @xmath61ni on @xmath62be(fig.1 ) and @xmath63ta(fig.2 ) , @xmath53ni on @xmath62be(fig.3 ) and @xmath63ta(fig.4 ) and @xmath55xe on @xmath64al(fig.5 ) .",
    "we show results for @xmath5=3.25 mev , 4.25 mev and 5.25 mev .",
    "the intermediate value of 4.25 mev fits the multitude of data better than the other two . for brevity",
    "we do not show results with other values of temperature in this range .",
    "recall that beam energy has changed from 140 mev / nucleon to 790 mev / nucleon and a variety of target - projectile combination has been used but the temperature in the plf has not moved much which is in accordance with the model of limiting fragmentation .",
    "the results in figs.1 - 5 do not include very peripheral collisions .",
    "for very peripheral collisions lower temperatures should be more appropriate .",
    "the use of one temperature for all impact parameters renders our calculation for very peripheral collisions quite inaccurate .",
    "we show this in fig.6 where for @xmath61ni+@xmath62be we use the same temperature 4.25 mev for all impact parameters . beyond @xmath8=25",
    "our calculation underestimates cross - sections . with @xmath5=4.25 mev nuclei produced very close to@xmath61ni by abrasion are losing too many nucleons by secondary decay . at a lower @xmath5",
    "this would get cut down . in this work , from now on , all the results we show pertain to nuclei with at least two nucleons removed from the projectile . in later",
    "work we hope to improve upon this .",
    "this most likely will require not only a profile in temperature but also a more sophisticated model for abrasion .",
    "we continue to show results of calculation and compare with experimental data .",
    "all calculations are done with @xmath5=4.25 mev and freeze - out volume @xmath65 .",
    "the examples shown were picked at random .",
    "we pick an isotope characterised by a value of @xmath8 and plot cross - sections for this @xmath8 for different values of @xmath66 .",
    "fig.7 shows results for the case of @xmath61ni on @xmath62be , fig.8 for @xmath61ni on @xmath63ta , fig.9 for @xmath53ni on @xmath62be , fig.10 for @xmath53ni on @xmath63ta and fig.11 for @xmath67xe on @xmath64al .",
    "there are no adjustable parameters any more and the calculated values of the cross - sections are pleasingly close to experimental values . for a given @xmath8",
    "the general shapes of cross - sections as a function of ( @xmath66 ) are reproduced but in some cases better mapping would be desirable .",
    "the topic of isoscaling has been much discussed in recent times .",
    "we examine if isoscaling follows from our calculation .",
    "we know of no obvious reasons why this feature should emerge from this model but it does(fig.12 ) .",
    "let @xmath68 be the cross - section for producing the nucleus @xmath42 in the reaction @xmath53ni+@xmath62be and @xmath69 be the cross - section for producing the same nucleus in the reaction @xmath61ni+@xmath62be .",
    "let @xmath70 .",
    "experimentally log of @xmath71 falls on a straightline as a function of @xmath7 for fixed @xmath8 and on a different straightline as a function of @xmath8 for fixed @xmath7 .",
    "this is called isoscaling .",
    "fig.12 shows that isoscaling emerges from this model but the slopes of log of @xmath72 are overestimated .    if one is looking at isoscaling only and has many more adjustable parameters , better fits to isoscaling data are possible @xcite .",
    "our objective here is to look at many other data also simultaneously and we do not have any flexibility . in a recent paper , for the case of @xmath61ni and @xmath53ni on @xmath62be isoscaling parameters were calculated using the hipse model @xcite .",
    "as our last example we consider the production of si isotopes from the reaction @xmath73ca on @xmath62be at beam energy 140 mev / nucleon .",
    "this was looked at before @xcite .",
    "there the relative values of cross - sections were calculated using a canonical or a grand canonical model where the temperature was adjusted to get the best fit . for absolute values",
    "another constant was needed which was adjusted . here",
    "we show ( fig.13 ) absolute values of cross - sections of si isotopes with @xmath5=4.25 mev and @xmath65 as in all our reported calculation above . in expt .",
    "the maximum yield is at @xmath7=16 , we get it at @xmath7=17 .",
    "the absolute values of the cross - sections at higher yield points agree very well but the shape of the theoretical curve is steeper where the cross - sections are very small .",
    "several modifications to the model of plf fragmentation developed here can be considered .",
    "one would be a more rigorous choice of @xmath0 ( eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "another would be variation of the temperature @xmath5 in very peripheral collisions .",
    "calculations reported here suggest that for beam energy upwards of 140 mev / nucleon an implementable model for projectile fragmentation gives reasonable results for cross - sections of end products .",
    "one needs to do an impact parameter integration ; at each impact parameter an abraded nucleus is formed at a temperature of about 4.25 mev .",
    "this expands to about three times its original volume and then breaks up thermodynamically into smaller but still hot nuclei .",
    "these can further boil off very light particles reaching the end stage .",
    "it is rather quick to calculate the abrasion and the thermodynamic break up .",
    "calculating the evaporation of light particles at the last stage takes more time .",
    "however we have found that since in the last stage usually there is both a loss and a gain in the population of many composites even without the last stage one has an acceptable measure of cross - sections .    while we have reasonable agreements with many data considered here it is desirable to push the model for improvements .",
    "two obvious goals will be : to find a more sophisticated model of abrasion specially at the low energy end and to build , on physics ground , dependence of temperature on impact parameter for very peripheral collisions .",
    "we plan to work on these .",
