    "it has been found that galaxy morphology is a function of environment ( dressler 1980 ; whitmore et al . 1993 ) and redshift ( dressler et al .",
    "colours and star formation rate ( sfrs ) of galaxies also show similar dependence on environment and redshift ( e.g. butcher & oemler 1984 ; lewis et al .",
    "2002 ) . to account for these observational trends ,",
    "several mechanisms that may suppress the star formation ( sf ) and transform one morphological type into another have been proposed .",
    "interaction between galaxies is one possible process to promote morphological transformation .",
    "numerical simulations confirmed that major mergers produce galaxies resembling ellipticals as merger remnants ( barnes 1996 ) and that accretion of small satellites onto their host spiral lead a host spiral to s0 type ( walker et al .",
    "because the galaxy merger triggers starburst , the cold gas contained in original galaxies is exhausted in a very short time .",
    "the second mechanism is removal of hot reservoir .",
    "in denser environment such as clusters , diffuse hot gas reservoir that is originally confined in haloes of non - central galaxies becomes part of intracluster medium . a galaxy whose hot gas reservoir is removed slowly exhausts its cold gas in its sf time - scale ( strangulation ) .",
    "above 2 processes , i.e. major merger - induced starburst and strangulation , has been incorporated in most of semi - analytic ( sa ) models which have failed to reproduce intermediate @xmath2 population ( okamoto & nagashima 2001 ; diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this paper , we introduce two additional processes in order to solve this problem .",
    "one is ram - pressure stripping ( rps ) of the cold gas from galactic disks ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "another is minor merger - induced small starburst .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations showed some fraction of disk gas is fuelled to the galactic centre by a minor merger ( walker et al .",
    "1996 ) . by using a combination of @xmath1-body simulations with a sa model , we study roles of above 4 processes in evolution of galaxies and what process is responsible for the formation of intermediate @xmath2 galaxies .",
    "we here consider a @xmath0-dominated cold dark matter universe ( @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) .",
    "we simulate a cluster region to study cluster galaxies and a region whose density is almost the same as the mean density of the universe to study field population .",
    "we then construct merger trees of virialised haloes and their substructure haloes .",
    "the details of this procedure is given in okamoto & habe ( 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "to clarify the effect of each physical process , we here examine 4 models .",
    "the model in which we do not consider either the rps or the minor burst is called the _ standard _ model , because this is the standard prescription in sa models .",
    "model parameters in the standard model is normalised so that it reproduces luminosity functions , cold gas fractions , and sizes of field galaxies .",
    "we also show the model using 4 times longer sf time - scale than the standard model to see the effect of the strangulation .",
    "this model is referred to as the _ low sfr _ model .",
    "the model with the minor burst and the model with the rps are called `` minor burst '' and `` rps '' , respectively . in these models",
    ", we use the same parameters as used in the standard model .",
    "the details can be found in okamoto & nagashima ( 2003 ) .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ] , we show colour - magnitude relations ( cmrs ) for simulated galaxies in the standard field model and cluster cores ( @xmath5 mpc ) . we classify galaxies with @xmath6-band @xmath7 as late - type and others as early - type galaxies .",
    "first of all , the cmrs for early - type galaxies are quite similar in all models , even in the field .",
    "it suggests that major merger - induced starbursts mainly truncate sf in early - type galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , colours of late - type galaxies are sensitive to the sf time - scale and their environments .",
    "blue population seen in the field model is vanished in the cluster if we use appropriate sf time - scale . since",
    ", in the low sfr model , late - type galaxies have much bluer colours than those in the standard model , it can be said that strangulation is the process that stops sf of late - type galaxies in cluster cores .",
    "the suppression of sf by strangulation is so efficient that the effect of the rps is hardly seen except in the low sfr + rps model .",
    "it has been known that galaxies in inner regions of clusters are redder than those in outer regions .",
    "recent observations have confirmed the existence of colour gradients in the galaxy population , which appear to continue even beyond the virial radius ( e.g. carlberg et al . 1997 ) . in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the @xmath8 colours of the cluster galaxies at @xmath9 as a function of projected radius .",
    "the projected radius is normalised by @xmath10 that is the radius inside which the mean density is 200 times the critical density of the universe at a given redshift .",
    "the observational data are taken from diaferio et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "for the standard and minor burst models , the effect of the rps can be seen only at large radii , because , in the central part , the sf is strongly suppressed by the strangulation . by comparing the low sfr + rps model with the low sfr model , it is found that the rps is effectively suppresses sf at @xmath11 if there is some cold gas left in the galaxies . while the minor burst makes galaxies galaxies slightly redder than those in the standard model , the models with and without the minor burst produces almost the same results .",
    "recently , some authors have studied the morphology - density ( or radius ) relations by using a hybrid method of @xmath1-body simulations and sa models ( okamoto & nagashima 2001 ; diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ; springel et al .",
    "2001 ) . in their work ,",
    "s0 or intermediate @xmath2 population in clusters is hardly reproduced unless a wider @xmath2 range is adopted to classify simulated galaxies as s0s .",
    "here we examine how the rps and minor burst affect the intermediate @xmath2 population in clusters .",
    "we show morphological fractions in the cluster as a function of radius in the righ panels of fig .",
    "the simulated galaxies are classified according to their @xmath6-band @xmath2 ; @xmath12 as bulge - dominated , @xmath7 as disk - dominated , and @xmath13 as intermediate . by comparison of the cnoc sample with the standard model",
    ", it is confirmed that the intermediate fraction in the standard model is much smaller than the observation , while the bulge - dominated fraction is reproduced .",
    "even when we consider the rps , the intermediate fraction is still too small .",
    "it is because most of the disk - dominate galaxies are almost pure disk galaxies without minor bursts ( okamoto & nagashima 2003 ) , and then the rps simply darkens the disk - dominated galaxies rather than increasing their @xmath2s .",
    "the strange behaviour seen in the rps models at @xmath14 results from the small number of galaxies at the radius because of the spherical high - resolution region .",
    "the minor bursts increases the intermediate fraction without changing the bulge - dominated fraction because it affects only galaxies with small @xmath2s . as a result",
    ", the minor burst model reproduces the observed fractions quite well despite the fact that it does not influence other properties of galaxies . thanks to minor bursts ,",
    "now the disk - dominated galaxies tend to be non - pure disk galaxies .",
    "consequently , the rps can change their @xmath2 by the fading of their disks . in the minor burst + rps model",
    ", we can see the increasing intermediate fraction toward the centre .",
    "we have investigated the effects of major mergers , strangulation , rps of cold disk gas , and minor mergers on the evolution of bright cluster galaxies .",
    "we have used a combination of the cosmological @xmath1-body simulations and the sa galaxy formation model .",
    "this method enables us to study above environmental effects in a fully cosmological context .",
    "we have determined the model parameters of the reference model to reproduce galaxy properties at @xmath15 .      1 .   the process that terminates sf in early - type galaxies ( @xmath16 ) in all environments is starburst trigger by a major merger .",
    "if we adopt appropriate sf time - scale , so as to reproduce the observed cold gas mass fraction in the field , the dominant process that determines colours of galaxies in the cluster core is the strangulation .",
    "3 .   since the strangulation sufficiently suppresses sf in cluster cores , the effect of the rps is hardly observed .",
    "4 .   minor burst does not affect galaxy properties except for morphology .",
    "5 .   without minor bursts",
    "the fraction of intermediate @xmath2 galaxies in clusters becomes too small .",
    "the model with the minor burst can reproduce the observed morphology - radius relations .",
    "we conclude that the minor burst is essential process to form intermediate @xmath2 galaxies .",
    "the rps hardly increases intermediate population in the cluster without minor bursts .",
    "when the minor burst is taken into account , the rps increases the intermediate galaxy fraction in the cluster cores .",
