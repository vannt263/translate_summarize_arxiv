    "with the discovery of the scalar higgs boson , @xmath6 , the particle spectrum of the standard model ( sm ) is now complete .",
    "but there are numerous theoretical motivations to expect that the sm electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism is not the complete story , and the scalar spectrum responsible for it may be richer than one possessing only one neutral scalar - the higgs boson . from this expectation ,",
    "searches for new scalars , neutral or charged , are continuously being carried out both by the atlas and cms collaborations in various channels . no confirmed hints along these directions",
    "has been found so far in any of these searches .",
    "the nature of these additional particles in different theories are based on its charge , spin , mass and interactions with the sm particles .",
    "any beyond the sm ( bsm ) scenario can be seen in various observables associated with the decay modes of these new particles .",
    "for example , any enhancement in the fiducial cross sections for the relevant processes could cause excesses in transverse momentum , @xmath17 , spectrum in the intermediate regions of the decayed particles , in ( pseudo)rapidity distributions or in some angular observables .",
    "signatures of a massive object with an appropriate choice of its decay width can also be observed as an excesses in the invariant mass distribution around the mass of that object .",
    "these excesses can be understood with the help of appropriate theoretical models .",
    "it is also noted that , if any new physics is present , one would expect that it will possibly pop - up , not only in one set of data , but in different ( theoretically ) correlated searches or channels with different significances .",
    "therefore , while interpreting the excesses or anomalies , it is important to scrutinise different data sets simultaneously , which we think might be correlated in terms of simple model assumptions .    in these proceedings",
    ", we shall discuss a formalism to address some of these subjects by extending the sm with another higgs - doublet in the theory and with an additional scalar or fermions to make the modelling appropriate and obtain the correct kinematics .",
    "section  [ theory ] will briefly deal with the theoretical model by extending the sm with one higgs - doublet .",
    "the phenomenological aspects , with proposed formalism , are discussed in section  [ pheno ] , and summary follows in section  [ conc ] .",
    "we start by quoting one of the classic texts in higgs - boson physics  @xcite -    _  in this book we will repeatedly emphasise that many people who have studied higgs physics do not expect a single , neutral boson of some definite mass to occur as the only direct manifestation of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . \" _    as we all know",
    "the `` minimal higgs '' in the @xmath18 electroweak theory higgs sector is comprised of only one complex higgs doublet , and we have only one physical neutral higgs scalar present in the sm spectrum , where its mass is a free parameter , not fixed by theory . in the current scenario , where this higgs boson is almost confirmed to be @xmath19 125 gev , it is prudent to explore the implications of more complicated higgs models in the context of extended theories . in any such theories",
    "there are basically two major constraints which need to be satisfied :    * first constraint comes from the experimental fact that @xmath20 should be very close to 1 .",
    "the general formula is @xmath21 \\left| v_{t , y }   \\right|^2 c_{t , y}}{\\sum_{t , y } 2\\,y^2 \\left| v_{t , y }   \\right|^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 defines the vacuum expectation values of each neutral higgs field @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 specifying the total @xmath26 isospin and hypercharge of the higgs representation to which it belongs . here",
    "the notation , @xmath27 is for complex representation of ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 should be for real representation of ( @xmath30 ) . *",
    "second major theoretical constraint on the higgs sector comes from severe limits on the existence of flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc s ) , which is absent in the minimal higgs model at tree level and which must also be true in any extended models .    keeping these issues in mind , let s extend by one more higgs doublet and call it a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) . to date there are many versions or types of 2hdms  @xcite and the key features can be summarised as follows :    * as an extension of the sm , this model adds new phenomena ( e.g. the physical charged higgs bosons ) . *",
    "since it is a minimal extension , it adds only a few new arbitrary parameters . *",
    "it satisfies theoretical constraints of @xmath31 and the absence of potentially dangerous tree - level fcnc , by imposing some particular symmetries .    considering two complex @xmath26 doublet scalar fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the most general remormalizable scalar potential may be written as : @xmath34 \\notag \\\\   & + \\left [ \\left [ \\lambda_6 \\left(\\phi_1^\\dag \\phi_1\\right ) + \\lambda_7 \\left(\\phi_2^\\dag \\phi_2\\right)\\right ]   \\phi_1^\\dag \\phi_2 + \\text{h.c.}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{pot2hdm }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry , five physical higgs particles are left in the spectrum , one charged higgs pair , @xmath14 , one cp - odd scalar , @xmath13 , and two cp - even states , @xmath0 ( heaviest ) and @xmath6 ( lightest ) given as : @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the @xmath38 and @xmath39 components of the @xmath40 doublet for @xmath41 .",
    "the angle @xmath42 diagonalises the cp - even higgs squared - mass matrix and @xmath43 diagonalises both the cp - odd and charged higgs sectors with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 for @xmath41 and @xmath46 .",
    "this is a brief summary of how 2hdms are constructed and further based on different choices of symmetries , couplings to quarks and leptons etc .",
    "different models can be built .",
    "models which lead to natural flavour conservation can be named as type - i , type - ii , lepton - specific or flipped 2hdms , as detailed in ref.@xcite . in our studies",
    "we used a type - ii 2hdm for reference .",
    "in the previous section we discussed an extension of the higgs boson sector , where apart from the sm higgs boson we have extra particle spectrum of phenomenological interest . here we describe an effective lagrangian formalism and then follow a discussion on a specific scenario of a 2hdm , with prospects to correlate these studies for phenomenological purposes .    in all numerical analyses",
    "the codes are written in ` mathematica ` , ` c^{++ } ` , ` python ` , models are generated with ` feynrules ` which are further used for simulation through ` madgraph5 ` .",
    "events are then showered and hadronized using ` pythia 8.2 ` , plotting and analyses followed through ` rivet ` and ` root ` package .",
    "dark matter related constraints calculated using ` microomegas ` .      here",
    "we consider an effective lagrangian approach with the introduction of two hypothetical real scalars @xmath0 and @xmath1 beyond sm particle spectrum , to study phenomenology associated with higgs boson physics .",
    "the formalism considered heavy scalar boson which decays into the sm higgs and @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is considered as a dark matter ( dm ) candidate - a source of missing energy ( met ) .",
    "the required vertices for the studies are : @xmath47,\\\\   \\mathcal{v}_{\\text{t } } & = -\\frac{1}{2}~v\\big[\\lambda_{_{hhh}}hhh + \\lambda_{_{h\\chi\\chi}}h\\chi\\chi + \\lambda_{_{h\\chi\\chi}}h\\chi\\chi\\big ] , \\\\",

    "major constraints on the parameters of the vertices come from the relic density of dm and the dm - nuclei inelastic scattering cross sections , which left a narrow choice of mass of the dm candidate @xmath53 with @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the masses of these scalars considered to be @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath5 is the top quark mass . in this study",
    "if we consider a process @xmath55 , a distortion could be predicted in the intermediate higgs @xmath17 spectrum due to decay of heavy @xmath0 and a recoil affect against a pair of invisible particles , @xmath1 . in order to chose appropriate values of associated couplings one must consider the constraints from all potential sources and different processes .",
    "it is to be noted , while considering various processes where the effective @xmath56 coupling plays a vital role one may assume this coupling to be large or small in respect of branching ratios for @xmath57 .    however in this effective field theory approach , we are not sure about the origin of the @xmath56 coupling . and in case if it is large , we can assume that this term can be generated due to the participation of a real scalar particle , @xmath8 , in the intermediate state through an effective @xmath58 coupling followed by the decay of @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of @xmath8 can open up various new possibilities .",
    "in addition to the above studies , if we look over the double higgs production modes in different decay channels like @xmath60 or @xmath61 with jets etc . , the vertices defined above ( [ vh])-([vq ] ) will be modified appropriately with @xmath8 as an intermediate scalar and not a dm candidate , is a scalar particle with various decay modes and having all possible branchings to other particles , since this is no more longer stable like a dm candidate . as a result ,",

    "this invokes other possibilities for the mass spectrum of @xmath8 .",
    "the processes in such studies include @xmath64 and in particular @xmath65 with respect to @xmath66 , considering the available spectrum of @xmath67 and the associated coupling parameters .",
    "there is a possibility to introduce a @xmath68 vertex in the study , which participates further in a @xmath69 decay channel , as @xmath70 modes , with the participation of this vertex in other possible processes too .",
    "furthermore , all other possible decay modes of @xmath8 , with @xmath8 into jets are possible .      considering these analyses",
    ", now we can think of @xmath0 as a heavy scalar through the effective lagrangian , the scalar @xmath0 is not necessarily assumed to be a 2hdm heavy scalar .",
    "] of the 2hdm , and furthermore , our motive should then be to fit all the parameters like @xmath71 , @xmath42 and the masses of @xmath13 and @xmath14 in this specific model .",
    "but it is also a question as to whether we think of a generalised version of a 2hdm or any particular type of this model , as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we also need to consider experimental data on searches which will directly or in - directly affect the processes taken into consideration in this model and the signatures could be :    * the resonance searches gives an excess around a particular narrow mass range ( with appropriate decay width approximation ) in the invariant mass spectrum in di - jets or di - boson , @xmath72 , ( where @xmath73 ) final states , and that provides a hint for a beyond sm particle .",
    "the masses for these resonances , @xmath74 , ( where @xmath75 in 2hdms ) might be of the order of @xmath76 ( which we considered in our previous studies for @xmath77 ) or beyond this order like @xmath78 @xmath79(1 tev ) or even @xmath80(1 tev ) . * in the 2hdm spectrum , we also have the possibility of charged higgs ( @xmath14 ) that can be produced at the lhc and these searches follows considering production cross sections and branching ratios in different decay channels . the prominent modes of decay of @xmath81 are @xmath82 when @xmath83 .",
    "since , we consider @xmath84 , the decay mode of @xmath85 could be a prominent channel too in case of @xmath86 .    in purview of phenomenological aspects for a cp - odd scalar , @xmath13 , in 2hdms , following salient features",
    "could be observed :    * in 2hdms masses of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are correlated .",
    "so if we wish to have a 2hdm with a particular mass @xmath87 , comparably @xmath88 should also be considered . and",
    "with a known value of @xmath89 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath90 gev one should tune the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 accordingly . * in case of a production mode of @xmath13 , through the @xmath91 vertex , there will be a need to have a scale factor @xmath92 as taken in the case of @xmath0 production , @xmath93 , and considering the decay modes @xmath94 in particular needs another scale factor @xmath95 . in this respect , for consistency",
    ", one needs to control the @xmath96 decay rates via another parameter @xmath97 , since the form factors appearing in the calculation of @xmath98 and @xmath99 have a different structure and also are dependent on the masses of particles under consideration @xcite .",
    "one should also study other possible decay modes @xmath13 in @xmath100 or @xmath16 which is available only at loop level in 2hdms , since @xmath101 and @xmath102 couplings are absent due to cp conservation issues .",
    "* this model can predict anomalously large @xmath16+jets+met events , we need to think of the contribution of the decay mode of @xmath103 , where the process should be @xmath104 ( @xmath1 should be considered as missing energy , similar to what we considered before in @xmath105 ) . to be noted , here we need @xmath106 . * in respect of point ( 3 ) mentioned above , we also consider different processes with final states with multi - lepton , tri - lepton and di - lepton channels by same - sign and opposite - sign leptons selection with jets in our phenomenological interests due to the charged higgs , @xmath14 , in 2hdms . * since yukawa couplings for top - quarks , @xmath49 ,",
    "are well known , one should adjust the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 in such a way so that @xmath107 and @xmath108 must follow appropriate branchings into @xmath109 and @xmath110 . here",
    "we should also notice that , since @xmath49 is close to unity due to large top - quark mass , it also adds an insight for the scale of any new physics .",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath14 itself is a subject of great detail , since one should consider either @xmath111 or @xmath83 . and due to this fact the decay modes for the studies are dependent on @xmath88 following the appropriate mixing parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 in 2hdms .",
    "we consider the case in which @xmath83 .",
    "the production of @xmath14 at the lhc would follow two mechanisms which have sizeable production cross sections ( 1 ) @xmath112 , @xmath113 and ( 2 ) @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "also @xmath14 production at hadron colliders can be studied through drell - yan processes for pair production , @xmath116 , the associated production with @xmath117 bosons , @xmath118 , and pair production through the gluon - gluon fusion @xmath119 .",
    "the prominent decay modes for @xmath14 are @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 . here , with the allowed vertices in the 2hdm , one could think of channels where @xmath14 couples with @xmath0 and further @xmath57 gives opportunities to study this mode in terms of @xmath1 or missing energy aspects . the decay mode @xmath85 as discussed before can be included in the studies as a prominent channel .",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath14 also depends on whether ( i ) @xmath123 or ( ii ) @xmath124 , since @xmath125 could be consider as heavy as @xmath87 .",
    "as noticed , in all our studies we are considering an extra scalar @xmath1 as a dark matter candidate - as a signature of missing energy .",
    "but while considering various other excesses in data it may not be suitable to consider @xmath1 as a scalar .",
    "so we need to characterise @xmath1 in other possible theories which could give appropriate reasons to consider the scale factors @xmath126 s introduced in the previous discussion , since the production ( decay ) modes for @xmath127 are through @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) loops and there @xmath1 may be introduced in loops .",
    "suppose the events with @xmath129 excess scenarios , one may introduce an extra particle in the studies , with possible ranges of @xmath87 , and then @xmath13 could be produced or decay via loops of massive coloured fermions .",
    "these extra particles could not be a fourth generation of the sm particles .",
    "simple possibilities for these extra fermions maybe : ( i ) a single vector - like charges 2/3 quark .",
    "( ii ) an isospin doublet of vector - like charge 2/3 and -1/3 quarks , ( iii ) an isodoublet and two singlet charge 2/3 and -1/3 quarks , and ( iv ) a complete vector - like generation including leptons as well as quarks . in this respect",
    "we should consider all four characteristics of @xmath1 , as vector - like fermions ( vlf ) .",
    "similar studies can follow for @xmath100 and @xmath16 decay modes of @xmath13 .      now by knowing the requirements discussed above , we need to investigate a particular scenario of a 2hdm to accommodate and constrain the parameter space of this model .",
    "to start with the production mechanism of the scalars @xmath6 , @xmath0 and a pseudo scalar @xmath13 , we should notice the fact that at the lhc the dominant mode of production is through @xmath128-fusion",
    ". however , @xmath130 , ( @xmath131 ) tree level couplings are not available in 2hdms was the case for the sm higgs also , and is only possible through various quark - loop contributions .",
    "the generalised functional form is given as ( see , e.g. ref .",

    "so effectively depending on a choice of @xmath137 limits , @xmath140 is correspondingly chosen and therefore we can incorporate those factors in a coupling parameter , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
