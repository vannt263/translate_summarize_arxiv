    "@xcite , it has been recognized that hadronic tau decays provide an excellent experimental setting for extracting precise values of standard model parameters such as the strong coupling constant @xmath0 @xcite , the strange quark mass @xmath4 @xcite , and the ckm matrix element @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the importance of a precise determination of qcd parameters can hardly be overemphasized , both in order to test the validity of the standard model as well as to constrain physics beyond the standard model . in particular",
    ", @xmath0 has a special status as the coupling constant of qcd .",
    "the current world average value as given by ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath6 methods to determine @xmath0 include , among others , deep inelastic scattering , the @xmath7 cross section , the @xmath8 width , and the lattice .",
    "what is special about the determination from tau decays is that it extracts @xmath0 at a remarkably low energy scale ( @xmath9 gev ) , but still high enough for perturbation theory to be applicable and non - perturbative effects to be small .",
    "because of asymptotic freedom , the relative error on @xmath0 gets reduced by roughly a factor of three after evolving it from the tau mass to the @xmath8 mass .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite performed an analysis based on the aleph data collected at lep , quoting as the final value @xmath10 which , extrapolated to the @xmath8 mass , gives @xmath11 a somewhat more conservative estimate was given in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath12 these results are compatible with the opal value of @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the results in ( [ alphaz ] ) , together with the lattice result  @xcite @xmath14 are the most precise determinations of the strong coupling constant to date . remarkably , they differ from each other by 2.7 standard deviations .",
    "in fact , as emphasized by bethke @xcite , these two values extracted from tau decay and the lattice differ from the world average computed with all the other measurements by @xmath15 and @xmath16 standard deviations , respectively . given the relevance of these measurements , we think it is timely to assess the validity of the theoretical assumptions that go into the estimates of systematic errors in both cases .",
    "our aim in this paper is to do this for the result extracted from tau data .",
    "we may subdivide the systematic uncertainties in the tau determination of the strong coupling according to three ( not mutually independent ) categories :    * the truncation of the perturbation theory series in @xmath0 .",
    "this is sometimes considered to be the largest uncertainty , and it is usually estimated by applying different resummation techniques , such as fixed - order perturbation theory ( fopt ) , contour - improved fixed - order perturbation theory ( cipt ) or renormalon chain resummation ( rcpt ) . this has been studied , _",
    "e.g. _ , in refs .",
    "@xcite . * the truncation of the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "the ope is an expansion in inverse powers of the momentum , each multiplied by a vacuum condensate of increasingly higher dimension , which in any practical application has to be truncated at a certain order  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the divergence of the perturbative series in @xmath0 may be linked to the ope through renormalons  @xcite .",
    "this suggests a strong correlation between perturbation theory and the ope .",
    "in particular , the gluon condensate depends on the renormalization scheme and may also depend on the order at which the series in @xmath0 is truncated  @xcite .",
    "however , if the same prescription for the perturbative expansion is used in both vector and axial - vector channels , the gluon condensate should also be the same in these two channels .",
    "the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite currently finds two different values for the gluon condensate from the vector and the axial - vector channels , given , _",
    "e.g. _   in cipt , by @xmath17 which are incompatible within about 3 standard deviations .",
    "this suggests that the systematic errors may not be fully understood .",
    "the situation concerning condensates of higher order is also unclear .",
    "see for example the recent analyses in refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein . *",
    "the ope is valid in the euclidean region , where there are no physical states .",
    "in contrast , on the minkowski axis the expansion is not guaranteed to work .",
    "this lack of convergence of the ope on the minkwoski axis is usually referred to as due to `` duality violations '' ( dvs ) . to our knowledge , the best way to understand the problem is at @xmath18 , where the spectrum becomes an infinite set of poles . even in this limit",
    "the ope has a cut due to the logarithms from the anomalous dimensions that survive in the large-@xmath19 limit , and does not reproduce the set of infinite poles .",
    "nevertheless , the standard analysis of tau decays involves an integration over a circle in the complex momentum plane which includes the minkowski axis as well ( see eq .  ( [ cauchyope ] ) below ) .",
    "of course , it is not known how much things might improve in the real - world case , in which @xmath20 , relative to the limit @xmath21 , because at @xmath20 the infinite set of poles becomes a cut .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the ope will reproduce this cut systematically .",
    "of course , this problem has been widely recognized , and strategies have been introduced to ameliorate the problem .",
    "one of those strategies employed in both the aleph and opal analyses is the use of so - called ",
    "pinched weights , \" in which zeroes in the weight function suppress the region near the minkowski axis  @xcite ( see below ) . while this is expected to help , it is unknown to what degree , because there is no systematic theory of dvs @xcite .",
    "this makes it very difficult to estimate the associated systematic error .    in the method of analysis that has become standard for tau decays dvs",
    "are set to zero by fiat  @xcite .",
    "we consider this situation to be unsatisfactory ; if eventually dvs are to be dismissed , it should be as a result of a data - driven analysis rather than as a result of not knowing how to take them into account . our aim , then , is to get a better understanding of the errors associated with dvs , as well as their interplay with the use of the ope . lacking a theory of dvs that one could use to perform a systematic study in tau decays , the best one can do is to resort to a model , and that is what we will do in this paper .",
    "the advantage of a model is that one has full analytical control .",
    "therefore , it can be used to test the degree of accuracy obtained with the standard method of analysis for tau decays .",
    "the disadvantage is , of course , that the model may not represent the situation in qcd .",
    "although the usefulness of a model is thus limited , we believe that a physically well motivated model can still give a fair idea of what to expect in the real world .",
    "compared to the standard analysis , in which dvs are not taken into account at all , our model is in fact rather conservative , with dvs which are exponentially suppressed at higher energies .",

    "however , the optimal number of terms in the ope may depend on the case at hand , and does not have to be the same in the case of qcd .",
    "the present analysis of data for hadronic tau decays is based on the use of finite - energy sum rules , in order to deal with the non - perturbative effects that can not be neglected at a scale as low as the tau mass .",
    "this involves an extrapolation of the ope for the hadronic spectral functions over a full circle around the origin in the complex momentum plane , including a region near the minkowski axis where the physical spectrum is located and the ope is not expected to work . although the contribution from this region is minimized by including in the integrand convenient weight functions which vanish where the circle intersects the minkowski axis , contributions from duality violations do not exactly vanish , and it is reasonable to expect that they have a residual effect .",
    "this effect , if sizeable , contaminates the determination of @xmath0 and the ope condensates from hadronic tau decays .",
    "in fact , there already seems to be some ( perhaps circumstantial ) evidence that there is something beyond the ope lurking in the tau data .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction , the value of @xmath0 extracted from tau decay is barely consistent with the other most precise determination , which is claimed by the lattice .",
    "moreover , the gluon condensate , which is the leading non - perturbative effect in the ope , comes out clearly different depending on whether the vector or the axial - vector channels are used in the analysis .    in spite of this , to the best of our knowledge , no analysis of duality violations has been done on the tau data , and this gap has been the main motivation for the present work . with the help of a physically motivated model ,",
    "we have studied a method for extracting both the coefficient of the parton model logarithm ( from which @xmath0 is extracted in the real case as a radiative correction ) , as well as the ope condensates . for simplicity , we have taken the vector channel as the case study , but the axial - vector channel can in principle be treated similarly .",
    "the obvious advantage of having a well - defined model is that the exact answer is known .",
    "nevertheless , we have tried to simulate a semi - realistic situation by imagining fitting a general parametrization of duality violations to the model , as if it provided the real `` data . ''",
    "this allowed us to first test the standard method that has been used to date for analyzing tau decay data .",
    "we have found that , taken at face value , this method does a fair job , in spite of the presence of duality violations .",
    "the associated systematic error , however , would be too large to be acceptable in the case of the real world , if the results obtained with our model are any indication .",
    "needless to say , we do not yet know if that is the case .    it is interesting to note that our model provides a possible explanation for the fact that even if duality violations are exponentially suppressed , they might still be numerically important at energy scales of order a few gev . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dual ] , the scale for this exponential decay involves a factor @xmath19 , and may thus differ substantially from the typical hadronic scale of 1  gev .    in order to improve on the systematic error ,",
    "we have proposed a new method of analysis based on an iterative fit , described in sec .",
    "[ sec : iif ] .",
    "our results show that a substantial improvement may be possible if one is willing to do some modeling of the duality violations in the form of eq .",
    "( [ sinexp ] ) . at the same time , our results indicate that also enough terms of the ope should be taken into account . in the model",
    ", we needed to include condensates up to and including dimension ten . in the real world",
    ", this number of course could be different .",
    "since there exists at present no systematic theory of duality violations , we had to resort to a model and one might thus dismiss the results on the basis that they are model dependent .",
    "however , we think that it is very important to realize that , by the same argument , all the analyses of tau data performed so far have also been done with a model , namely one in which duality violations are dismissed by fiat , and not by a fit to the data . in terms of our _ ansatz",
    "_ , eq .  ( [ sinexp ] ) , current analyses are equivalent to setting the value of @xmath161 equal to zero .",
    "of course , it may turn out to be difficult to apply our new iterative fitting procedure to real - world data , because these are afflicted with sizable and correlated errors which we completely ignored in the present paper .",
    "in addition , in a fit over an interval such as proposed in sec .  [ sec : iif ] applied to real data , the running of @xmath0 would have to be taken into account .",
    "however , again , that does not justify ignoring duality violations altogether .",
    "it would be interesting to see how our method fares in the case of real data , even if it can only be used to establish bounds on the parameters @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "while this work was being finalized , two new determinations of @xmath0 at the tau mass appeared @xcite , which , after running to the @xmath163 scale , translate into @xmath164 respectively .",
    "these results differ from the lattice result ( _ cf . _   eq .  ( [ latticealpha ] ) ) by 1.5 and 2.6 standard deviations , respectively .",
