    "optimal control tackles the question of bringing a dynamical system from one state to another with minimum expenditure of time and resources  @xcite .",
    "when applied to quantum systems , control is facilitated by matter wave interference , thus often termed coherent control  @xcite .",
    "the target state is reached by constructive interference while destructive interference suppresses undesired outcomes .",
    "optimal control has been applied to quantum systems first in the context of physical chemistry to steer chemical reactions  @xcite , followed by control of spin dynamics for applications in nmr  @xcite .",
    "recently , optimal control is attracting much attention in the context of quantum information processing , for example as a tool to determine the minimum duration of high - fidelity quantum gates  @xcite , and for quantum simulation  @xcite .    for quantum systems with complex dynamics and optimization targets that are difficult to reach , it is impedient to utilize optimal control algorithms that converge fast and monotonically .",
    "the core of an optimization algorithm is made up of the control equations which govern the system dynamics and update of the control field .",
    "these equations are derived by variation of the target and additional cost functionals .",
    "monotonicity can either be ensured by a smart discretization of the coupled control equations  @xcite or built in using krotov s method  @xcite .",
    "the latter approach comes with the advantage of independence from the specific form of the optimization functional and matter - field interaction  @xcite .",
    "a non - linear matter - field interaction is encountered in multi - photon couplings which are important for example in the control of alignment and orientation  @xcite .",
    "additional constraints in the optimization functional can be employed to keep the system dynamics within a certain subspace  @xcite or to restrict the bandwidth of the optimized field  @xcite .",
    "the control time  @xcite is also a crucial parameter and its optimization can help to avoid , for example , parasitic phenomena with a longer time scale .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to test the efficiency of two recent optimization procedures , namely state - dependent constraints and time - optimization , when applied to the orientation dynamics of a linear molecule driven by an electromagnetic field .",
    "the control of molecular alignment and orientation is by now a well - recognized topic in quantum control with different applications extending from the control of chemical reactions to nanoscale design and quantum computing , see refs .",

    "it is this option that will be investigated here .",
    "the efficiency of the orientation is one important aspect in view of applications .",
    "another fundamental feature , which has received less attention so far , is the time during which the molecular orientation is above a given threshold under field - free conditions .",
    "a standard way to maximize this duration is to restrict the dynamics to a given subspace spanned by the lowest rotational states  @xcite . here",
    "we study the joint optimization of orientation and its duration , employing the state - dependent constraint algorithm of ref .",
    "most of the theoretical and experimental studies have so far been performed in the limit of an isolated molecule where intermolecular collisions are neglected  @xcite .",
    "dissipative effects such as those due to collisions can be avoided if the optimization time is sufficiently small .",
    "we investigate the question of optimization time using the time - optimization algorithm  @xcite , which allows to find the best compromise between the field fluence and the control duration .",
