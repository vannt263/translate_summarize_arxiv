    "facilities and infrastructures such as hospitals , schools , internet routers , origin from the development of human social civilization and in turn shape our modern daily life .",
    "this complex evolution process raises an interesting question that how these facilities are distributed and how they correlate with the whole social economic system .",
    "a better understanding on this issue could help to provide better public service and to save social opportunity cost .",
    "it is believed that population density and economic ingredient are crucial on deciding the locations of these facilities @xcite .",
    "but unevenly distributed population and economic level make the question very complicated . although studies ranging from business economics , system engineering , computer science , geography to even biology have addressed on the issue , both theoretical basis and empirical demonstration are inadequate @xcite .",
    "this causes the arbitrary assumption of uniformly distributed nodes in many spatial network models even though it is far from the reality @xcite .    intuitively , the number of facilities in an area increases with the corresponding population .",
    "the related studies can be traced back to a so - called _ p - median _ problem which aims to find the precise locations of facilities so that the mean distance that one reaches his nearest facility is minimized @xcite .",
    "numerical and analytic treatments have been used to suggest a relation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the facility density , @xmath2 is the population density and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this result accounts for the internet router distribution and the territorial division but does not consist with other empirical studies where although a universal scaling @xmath4 is evidenced , the value of @xmath5 , depending on types of facility , ranges from @xmath6 to @xmath7 rather than just fixed @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , commercial facility and public one has @xmath8 and @xmath3 , respectively , while for facility with both attributes , the exponent lies intermediate .",
    "these findings stimulated a recent study in which a general model based on the tradeoff between the profit ( commercial concern ) and the social opportunity cost ( public service ) was proposed @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath5 in that model represents the type of facility , which is described by the relative weight of commercial and public attributes .",
    "in other words it assumes a universal scaling exponent for a specific type of facility .",
    "( actually all the previous studies tacitly approve this assumption . )",
    "thus if we choose a part of these facilities according to some other properties , the scaling exponent is expected to be unchanged in this sample .    as we will show in this paper ,",
    "this is not always true . at least in chinese cases , samples from a specific type of facility according to per capital gdp yield an increasing scaling exponent .",
    "therefore the macroscopic power law relation between facility and population density is actually a mixture of different scaling functions .",
    "this multi - scaling property indicates a different picture that the attribute of a facility changes with the outside environment and consequently affects its real distribution . in the next section",
    "we will provide empirical evidences for the above arguments . and in section iii",
    ", we will try to offer an explanation and present a modified model to reproduce the multi - scaling property .",
    "we have gathered @xmath9-year empirical data ( @xmath10 ) including the positions of @xmath11 typical types of facility ( hospital , post office , school and theater ) , the population , gdp and the area of every county . despite of the temporal fluctuations ,",
    "there are totally more than @xmath12 counties and about @xmath13 hospitals , @xmath14 post offices , @xmath15 schools and @xmath16 theaters .",
    "all these data come from the china city statistical yearbook whose electronic versions can be found and downloaded at http://ishare.iask.sina.com.cn .",
    "these data allow us to calculate the population density , facility density , per capital gdp and their correlation at county level .",
    "such coarse - grained treatment was also applied in the previous study due to the resolution limitation of the facility positions @xcite .",
    "our first observation consists with the previous studies .",
    "indeed a scaling relation between population and facility density emerges in all the four types of facility ( fig .",
    "[ emone](a ) ) .",
    "a detailed analysis on their scaling exponents indicates that despite of the yearly fluctuations , the exponents stay around their own averages which are measured as @xmath17 for post office , theater , school , hospital respectively . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , post office and theater whose scaling exponents are close to @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be viewed as the representative of public and commercial facility .",
    "this is consistent with our experience that post office disregarding profit is necessary everywhere while theater behaves oppositely .    to examine the universality assumption of scaling exponent",
    ", we classify the counties into four different classes .",
    "specifically , we calculate the per capital gdp for each county and divide their logarithmic values into four equal intervals . those counties",
    "whose per capital gdp lie in a common interval belong to the same class .",
    "consequently counties in class @xmath7 have the lowest per capital gdp while those in class @xmath11 have the highest one .",
    "this classification distributes about @xmath18 counties in class @xmath7 and over @xmath19 ones in each of the other three .",
    "although the number of counties in class @xmath7 is almost half less , the number of the corresponding facilities is still larger enough to apply statistical analysis .",
    "another problem is whether the per capital gdp correlates obviously with the population density so that our method might cause serious statistical bias .",
    "this possibility is basically ruled out as the correlation turns out to be very weak ( correlation coefficient @xmath20 ) .    for each type of facility",
    ", we study their scaling relation in different classes . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ emtwo ] , in each class the relation between population and facility density is still a power law .",
    "but their scaling exponents are not equal but increase clearly with the per capital gdp level ( class number ) .",
    "this result contrasts with the universality assumption of the scaling exponent in ref .",
    "instead it indicates that the observed scaling relation @xmath21 is actually composed of some multi - scaling behaviors .",
    "if we accept the physical meaning of @xmath5 interpreted in ref.@xcite , the multi - scaling phenomenon reveals an interesting fact that facilities can change their attributes according to the outside economic environment .",
    "particularly , they tend to be commercial in high per capital gdp level area but still provide necessary public services in poor developed places .",
    "further detailed analysis suggests that this multi - scaling property as well as the positive correlation between the multi - scaling exponents and per capital gdp level occurs every year in all the types of facility regardless of their temporal fluctuations ( fig .",
    "[ emthree ] ) . for school and hospital ( fig .",
    "[ emthree](a ) and fig .",
    "[ emthree](b ) ) , the exponents vary from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , which almost covers the whole possible range . in contrast , the exponents of post office are much more stable . as shown in fig .",
    "[ emthree](c ) they stay near @xmath22 and rise up to no more than @xmath23 . similarly in fig .",
    "[ emthree](d ) , the range of the exponents of theater narrows around @xmath24 .",
    "it seems that purely commercial or public facilities are not likely to behave diverse attributes , which is somewhat consistent with our intuition .",
    "all these findings are not captured by the previous models and thus require a more complete theory .",
    "as will be presented later , a small modification by introducing the consuming capacity can reproduce most of these properties . before that , we will first review the model of ref .",
    "@xcite and clarify some useful concepts .",
    "suppose we are given the total population @xmath25 and the total number of facilities @xmath26 on a plane . and suppose people always visit their nearest facility , by which we can define the voronoi cell @xmath27 , whose area is @xmath28 , as the set of points closer to the @xmath29-th facility than to any others@xcite .",
    "this means that the number of visitors to the @xmath29-th facility is the number of people living in @xmath27 , which is denoted as @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the population density in @xmath27 is calculated as @xmath31 while the corresponding facility density @xmath32 is @xmath33 .    for commercial facility , ref .",
    "@xcite assumes that the profit of the @xmath29-th facility is proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , a facility having lower @xmath30 is better off moved to other location with higher population for higher profit .",
    "this strategy is applied by all the facility during the relocating process .",
    "finally the system will must reach an equilibrium so that every facility has almost the same profit , i.e. @xmath34 . then by using the expression @xmath35 and @xmath32 calculated above , we arrive at @xmath36 . on the other hand , public facility concerns prior the social opportunity cost caused by the distance between visitors and facilities , which is described by @xmath37 with @xmath38 representing the average distance to the @xmath29-th facility . to provide better public service , facilities at lower - cost places",
    "should be relocated to those with higher @xmath37 . then in steady state",
    ", @xmath39 becomes the same for all the facilities .",
    "again by using the expression @xmath35 and @xmath32 , we have @xmath40 . for facilities with both attributes , ref .",
    "@xcite defines a general quantity @xmath41 where @xmath42 is tunable within the range @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "analogous to the above analysis , one can derive the final scaling relation @xmath44 , which gives @xmath45 .",
    "however in this nicely compact model , the assumption that profit equals to population is too simple .",
    "after all , the profit is yet closely related to the commodity prices and people s consuming capacity .",
    "facilities providing luxury commodity are not opened at poor places even though they are densely populated because no one there can bear such high level consumption . on the other hand , facilities in the regions with lower population but higher consuming capacity",
    "can still benefit from high prices .",
    "therefore facilities with both attributes , due to their ingredient of commercial part , take chance to locate and gain at developed area even though the service there provided by their public ingredient is adequate enough .",
    "this causes the number of facility in a well developed area is larger than those in poor places even if they are equally populated , which indicates a more rapid increase of facility in high economic - level places .",
    "if we assume the consuming capacity has a positive correlation with per capital gdp , which seems plausible , the above explanation for multi - scaling does make sense .    to make the explanation more convincing , it is useful to introduce an alternative expression of eq.(1 ) to characterize the transition from public to commercial facility , expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 $ ] is a tunable parameter controlling the relative weight of commercial or public attribute and consequently determining the final exponent @xmath5 , just as the role of @xmath42 in eq.(1 ) .",
    "eq.(2 ) has the same physical meaning and similar effect to eq.(1 ) but turns out to be more difficult to apply analytical treatment .",
    "however , one can still prove its scaling property by the method used in ref.@xcite . to introduce the consuming capacity to the model ,",
    "we denote @xmath48 as the average expense consumed by every person living in voronoi cell @xmath27 so that the profit equals to @xmath49 .",
    "then eq.(2 ) is rewritten as @xmath50 the only modification compared to eq.(2 ) lies in the first term of the righthand of eq.(3 ) , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "this modification does not affect the macroscopic scaling law between @xmath1 and @xmath2 qualitatively , but changes the relative weight of commercial attributes on microscopic level . particularly , for large @xmath48 the first term @xmath52 is enhanced by the effective weight @xmath53 , which causes the system to concern more about profit .",
    "this leads the facility to be more commercial and the scaling exponent to be close to @xmath7 . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath48 is small , the second term @xmath54 takes over , then the system concerns more about social opportunity cost just like public facility and the exponent becomes close to @xmath6 .",
    "therefore even for the same @xmath55 ( i.e. the same type of facility ) , different @xmath48 leads to different system behavior .",
    "this is the reason why multi - scaling emerges and why their exponents increase with the economic level .",
    "moreover , if @xmath56 ( purely public facility ) , eq.(3 ) becomes @xmath48 independent .",
    "so the system degenerates to the classical model in ref.@xcite and thus displays only a single scaling relation with the exponent @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath57 ( purely commercial facility ) , eq.(3 ) depends totally on the first term .",
    "but @xmath48 in this case has no effect on the exponent but only changes the coefficient of the scaling relation , leaving the only exponent @xmath8 which is also independent of @xmath48@xcite .",
    "therefore multi - scaling property can be less pronounced in a very commercial or public facility , which explains the narrow range of the multi - scaling exponents observed in post office and theater .",
    "if we still adopt the idea in ref.@xcite and follow the expression of eq.(1 ) , the above explanation indicates that the exponent @xmath42 in eq.(1 ) should be modified to be a function of parameter @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath58 .",
    "then the multi - scaling exponent can be calculated as @xmath59 and the macroscopic exponent @xmath5 can be given by taking an average over all possible @xmath48 . to reproduce the multi - scaling property by simulation , we apply the following simple formula of @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents the possible maximum of @xmath63 and @xmath64 is a parameter controlling the sensitivity of @xmath42 with @xmath63 . if @xmath65 , the facility becomes purely commercial while if @xmath66 , it becomes purely public .",
    "so @xmath64 also controls the exponent @xmath5 .",
    "the real - world @xmath60 can be quite different ( probably related to the type of facility ) .",
    "finding its precise expression could be a complicated task and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the aim of our simulation is only to reproduce the multi - scaling phenomenon qualitatively .",
    "our simulation follows the similar process to that of ref.@xcite except for the above - proposed modification . specifically , we first distribute the population density @xmath2 and the economic level @xmath63 randomly on a plane .",
    "and then we further put some facilities of a certain type . at each time step , every facility calculates its benefit according to @xmath67 .",
    "facility with the lowest @xmath68 then moves to the region with the highest benefit .",
    "this process repeats until the system is steady . at steady state",
    ", we measure various quantities and their relations just as done for empirical data .",
    "note that the classification here is carried out according to the value of @xmath63 .",
    "other details of the simulation such as parameter setting are described in appendix a. in fig .",
    "[ modelone ] , we plot the simulated relation between population and facility density for different classes ( i.e. different level of @xmath63 or say different interval of @xmath63 ) .",
    "clearly it displays multi - scaling property with the exponents increasing with class number .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ modelone ] presents the results of the simulated multi - scaling exponents . for purely commercial ( @xmath65 ) or purely public ( @xmath66 ) facility ,",
    "the exponents become stable at @xmath7 or @xmath6 . but",
    "for intermediate @xmath69 , the exponents increase . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ modeltwo ] we demonstrate that the whole scaling relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 maintains in our modified model . and the scaling exponent @xmath5 in the simulation decreases with the parameter @xmath64 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ modeltwo ] .",
    "note that all these results can be calculated analytically .",
    "we present an analytical solution of @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ modeltwo ] , which is in good agreement with the simulation .",
    "more details about the analytical calculations are reported in appendix b.",
    "we have analyzed the scaling relation between population and chinese facility density at different per capital gdp levels .",
    "our study does not see the universality of the scaling exponent but instead suggests a multi - scaling picture .",
    "more interestingly , such multi - scaling exponents increase with the per capital gdp regardless of the type of facility .",
    "these results indicate that facilities can change their commercial or public attributes according to the outside environment , i.e. they take chance to gain more profit in developed area but still fulfil their public - service responsibility in poor region . we have also provided possible explanation and",
    "suggest a modification by considering consuming capacity .",
    "the modified model can reproduce most of our observed properties .",
    "our study stresses on existence rather than universality .",
    "indeed the multi - scaling property is observed every year for all the four types of facility .",
    "therefore their occurrence is certain rather than coincidental . on the other hand",
    "it is also appealing to explore whether this phenomenon occurs in other more developed country where the economic system is more balanced and stable . due to the limitation of data ,",
    "the present study can not cover this area .",
    "if this point is evidenced , it indicates the multi - scaling could be a common property .",
    "otherwise it either requires explanations from sociocultural , economic , politics , etc or leads us to a long - time dynamic evolution picture of facility allocation , both of which are significant on understanding our social economic system or even providing guidelines to urban development .",
    "this work was partially supported by the national nature science foundation of china under grant nos .",
    "11075057 , 11035009 and 10979074 .",
    "we use a coarse - grained simulation for our modified model .",
    "we first divide a plane into many unit squares whose area all equal to @xmath7 and assume that all the situations in one unit square are approximately identical .",
    "then we distribute for each unit square @xmath71 the population @xmath72 and the consuming capacity @xmath73 according to the corresponding distribution @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "and we further distribute randomly the initial number of facility @xmath76 .",
    "we use denotation @xmath77 to emphasize that the facility number changes with time during the simulation while @xmath72 and @xmath73 are always fixed as soon as they are distributed . since the area of all @xmath71 is @xmath7 , @xmath72 and @xmath78",
    "is exactly the population density and facility density respectively .",
    "the number of people visiting facility @xmath29 in place @xmath71 , denoted as @xmath79 , is calculated as @xmath80 while the average distance for these people to travel to facility @xmath29 , denoted as @xmath81 , is calculated as @xmath82@xcite .",
    "then we can determine the benefit @xmath83 for every facility @xmath29 in the unit square @xmath71 .",
    "note that this quantity only depends on place @xmath71 and is equal for any @xmath29 within this unit square , so we can replace @xmath84 by the denotation @xmath85 . at each time step of our simulation",
    ", we calculate the @xmath85 for each places according to the current @xmath77 .",
    "then we eliminate a facility in the place with the lowest @xmath85 and create one in the unit square with the highest @xmath85 .",
    "this procedure repeats until the system reaches its steady state , at which the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well as the exponents is stable .",
    "we test this coarse - grained method by repeating the simulation in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. setting @xmath86 as eq.(1 ) .",
    "we find the method behaves the same as the simulation in ref.@xcite and reproduces all their results . in our own simulation",
    ", we have @xmath87 different unit squares . and we set @xmath88 with @xmath89 $ ] and @xmath90 with @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "the initial distribution of facility is also uniform with @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "we choose power - law distribution of @xmath2 because i ) .",
    "it coincides with the real population distribution which is observed to be heavy - tailed ; ii ) .",
    "the power - law formula leads to a uniformly distributed data points on log - log plot , which gives a better visualization .",
    "note that other distributions do not change the simulation results qualitatively . by these parameters ,",
    "we obtain @xmath93 .",
    "when the simulation reaches its steady state , we measure various quantities and their relations just as done for empirical data .",
    "note that the classification here is carried out according to the value of @xmath63 .",
    "specifically , we divide the value of @xmath63 ( not the logarithmic value of @xmath63 ) into four equal intervals .",
    "those unit square @xmath71 whose @xmath73 lies in a common interval belongs to the same class .",
    "although there is a bit difference from what we have done for empirical data , it does not change our conclusion at all .",
    "since @xmath94 , the macroscopic exponent is exactly an average of @xmath95 over all possible @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath96 , where @xmath97 . substituting the corresponding parameters and equation , we have @xmath98 this function gives a good agreement with the simulation , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ modeltwo ] .",
    "particularly , for @xmath99 , eq.(b1 ) gives @xmath100 , which is consistent with the simulation data @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ modeltwo ] .",
    "we can also calculate the multi - scaling exponent for each class .",
    "the calculation is given by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the conditional probability density under class @xmath104 and equals to @xmath105 in our simulation .",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath62 here is related to the specific class @xmath104 .",
    "we calculate the multi - scaling exponents for @xmath69 and have the theoretical result @xmath107 for class @xmath108 , which is also consistent with the simulation data @xmath109 in the inset of fig .",
