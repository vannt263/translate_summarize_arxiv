    "phenomenological models of qcd are suitable for the study of hadrons and their interactions at energies of a few gev , where perturbative methods are not applicable , see e.g. @xcite .    in this work we use an effective chiral model of qcd ,",

    "the interaction with the ( axial-)vector states is obtained via the term @xmath21 : @xmath22with : @xmath23and @xmath24    the values of the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are fixed using the following physical quantities : the masses of the nucleon and nucleonic resonance , the decay width @xmath30 , the axial coupling constant of the nucleon and the axial coupling constant of the nucleonic resonance .",
