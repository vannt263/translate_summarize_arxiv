    "the study of a pseudo riemannian manifold @xmath2 via its isometry group @xmath3 is a central problem in pseudo riemannian geometry .",
    "the larger @xmath3 is , the simpler @xmath2 is .",
    "many manifolds have isometry group large enough so that lie theory can be applied . in mathematics and physics , @xmath4-dimensional anti de sitter space is a maximally symmetric lorentzian manifold with constant negative scalar curvature . in nontransitive cases",
    ", @xmath3 is a geometric invariant of @xmath2 ranking in importance with its curvature and geodesics .",
    "this is one of the reasons that nontransitive actions are of so much interest to mathematicians .",
    "a pseudo riemannian manifold @xmath2 is an @xmath2 such that a closed lie subgroup @xmath5 of @xmath3 acts on @xmath2 with a codimension one orbit .",
    "cohomogeneity one riemannian manifolds have been studied by many mathematicians ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the problem is still an active one .",
    "when the metric is indefinite , there are not so much papers in the literature ( see for example ) .",
    "in fact there are substantial differences between these two cases .",
    "a main difference is that in the riemannian case , where @xmath5 is closed in @xmath3 , the action is proper , ( see @xcite ) , which is vital in the study of the subject , while in the indefinite case , this assumption in general does not imply that the action is proper , so the study becomes much more difficult .",
    "also , some of the results and techniques of the definite metric fails for the indefinite metric .    in this paper , which is a continuation of we study three dimensional anti de sitter space @xmath1 . in ,",
    "we have studied proper actions on @xmath1 and we got some results about the acting group , the orbit space and the causal character of the orbits . here , the main key of the study is classifying , up to conjugacy , the closed and connected lie subgroups of @xmath0 which act effectively , isometrically and by on @xmath1 , in both proper and nonproper cases .",
    "when this is done , identifying causal characters of the orbits and the orbit space is an immediate consequence .",
    "when the action is proper , all the principal orbits have the same causal character , the same type and there is at most one compact singular orbit ( see theorem [ proper ] ) , but in the nonproper case there may be principal orbits of different causal characters , different types and there may be uncountably many singular orbits ( see theorems [ 3.4.1 ] , [ 3.4.2 ] and [ 3.4.3 ] ) .",
    "these are major differences between these two cases .",
    "let @xmath5 be a lie group which acts on a connected smooth manifold @xmath2 .",
    "the lie algebra of @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath6 . for each point @xmath7 in @xmath2",
    ", @xmath8 denotes the orbit of @xmath7 , and @xmath9 is the stabilizer in @xmath5 of @xmath7 . in this paper , if @xmath10 , then @xmath11 , so @xmath12 does not denote the lie algebra of the stabilizer in @xmath5 of @xmath7 , nor does @xmath13 denote the stabilizer in @xmath5 of @xmath7 . in fact , in this paper the notation @xmath13 will not be used .",
    "a smooth manifold @xmath2 is called of _ _ under an action of a lie group @xmath5 if an orbit has codimension one .",

    "the orbit space @xmath21 of a proper action of @xmath5 on @xmath2 is hausdorff , the orbits are closed submanifolds , and the stabilizers are compact ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the orbits @xmath8 and @xmath22 have the _ same orbit type _ if @xmath13 and @xmath23 are conjugate in @xmath5 .",
    "this defines an equivalence relation among the orbits of @xmath5 on @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 $ ] the corresponding equivalence class , which is called the _ orbit type _ of @xmath8 .",
    "a submanifold @xmath25 of @xmath2 is called a slice at @xmath7 if there is a @xmath5-invariant open neighborhood @xmath26 of @xmath8 and a smooth equivariant retraction @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 .",
    "a fundamental feature of proper actions is the existence of slice ( see @xcite ) , which enables one to define a partial ordering on the set of orbit types .",
    "the partial ordering on the set of orbit types is defined by , @xmath29 \\leq [ g(x)]$ ] if and only if @xmath13 is conjugate in @xmath5 to some subgroup of @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath25 is a slice at @xmath30 , it implies that @xmath29 \\leq [ g(x)]$ ] for all @xmath31 . since @xmath21 is connected , there is a largest orbit type in the space of orbit types .",
    "each representative of this largest orbit type is called a principal orbit .",
    "in other words , an orbit @xmath8 is principal if and only if for each point @xmath32 the stabilizer @xmath9 is conjugate to some subgroup of @xmath33 in @xmath5 .",
    "other orbits are called singular .",
    "we say that @xmath10 is a principal point if @xmath8 is a principal orbit .",
    "but for the nonproper action there is not slice in general , so we can not use the same definitions required the existence of slices as before , hence we use the definition 2.8.1 of @xcite for determining the principal , singular or exceptional orbits .",
    "according to it for the action of a lie group @xmath5 on the smooth manifold @xmath2 , the points @xmath34 , are said to be of the same type , with notation @xmath35 , if there is a @xmath5-equivariant diffeomorphism @xmath36 from an open @xmath5-invariant neighborhood @xmath26 of @xmath7 onto an open @xmath5-invariant neighborhood @xmath37 of @xmath30 .",

    "the equivalence classes will be called _ orbit types _ in @xmath2 , and are denoted by @xmath39 . if each stabilizer has only finitely many components , then @xmath35 if and only if @xmath9 is conjugate to @xmath33 within @xmath5 and the actions of @xmath9 , and @xmath33 , on @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively , are equivalent via a linear intertwining isomorphism ( see chapter 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the orbit @xmath8 of @xmath10 is _ principal _ if its type @xmath39 is open in @xmath2 .",
