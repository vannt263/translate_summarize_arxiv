    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) lies at the heart of modern quantum theory .",
    "qed is a well established and experimentally confirmed theory @xcite but even fifty years after its foundation many features of the atom  field interaction remain extremely intriguing . in particular , the character of the atom ",
    "field interaction can be substantially modified in _ confined spaces _",
    "( e.g. the high-@xmath0 cavity of a micromaser ) due to the fact that local properties of the electromagnetic ( em ) field depend on space boundaries .",
    "the radiative properties of atoms and the em field in confined spaces have been investigated for various cavity qed systems @xcite .",
    "quantum electrodynamics is a local theory , which means that the dynamics of atoms and electrons depend on local properties of the electromagnetic field with which they interact .",
    "but local properties of the electromagnetic field depend also on conditions imposed by the boundaries of the space region in which the field is confined @xcite .",
    "these conditions are reflected in the quantization of the field .",
    "we can either quantize the electromagnetic field in free space or in a `` quantization box '' of linear dimension @xmath1 .",
    "quantum electrodynamics in a box describes effects associated with processes inside high - quality ( perfect ) cavities . in addition , quantization in a box can be considered as an approximation to free - space quantization and the two theories must give the same results in the limit @xmath2 .    in the first quantum - mechanical description of spontaneous decay of a two - level atom in free space ,",
    "weisskopf and wigner @xcite started their calculations with the cavity modes quantized in a box , and then at a certain stage of the calculation , a limit to a continuum of modes was taken .",
    "this approach gives in first approximation correct results ( exponential decay of the excited level of the atom ) .",
    "the interaction of a two level atom with discrete ( cavity ) modes has been described systematically by hamilton @xcite who solved the emission and scattering problems exactly for a cubic box by diagonalization of the total atom - field hamiltonian .",
    "later this approach was utilized by other researchers for a detailed investigation of spontaneous emission of two - level atoms ( see for instance papers by davidson and kozak @xcite and swain @xcite ) . essentially , in all these papers on the spontaneous decay of a two - level atom in a cavity ( box ) , the coupling constant between the atom and the cavity modes has been taken to be position independent .",
    "this argument is perfectly justifiable in free space , when translational invariance is valid .",
    "on the other hand , when the atom interacts with discrete cavity modes in a confined space the position dependence of the coupling can play a significant rle .",
    "the investigation of this problem is not only of theoretical interest .",
    "recent advances in experimental techniques have allowed one to study fundamental processes in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity - qed ) @xcite and to verify various effects of the atom - field interaction in confined spaces as predicted by schelkunoff @xcite , purcell @xcite , barton @xcite and others .",
    "one of the fundamental processes of cavity qed represents the spontaneous decay of a two  level atom .",
    "it is well known that spontaneous emission from an atom positioned very close to the cavity mirror can be significantly suppressed .",
    "this effect is called the inhibition of spontaneous emission @xcite . the deviation from the exponential weisskopf  wigner decay of the atom in free space",
    "@xcite has been demonstrated in a number of experiments @xcite .",
    "many other interesting questions arise for these qed systems .",
    "for example , one could ask about the influence of cavity mirrors on the dynamics of the atom and the rle of the position of the atom on the appearance of poincar recurrences ( i.e. , re - excitations of the atom by radiation reflected by the cavity mirrors ) @xcite . while the exponential character of the decay is not affected by variations of the position of the atom around the center of the cavity ( providing",
    "the cavity is large enough ) , the poincar recurrences depend very sensitively on the position of the atom inside the cavity .",
    "namely , variation of the position of the atom within a wavelength of the resonant atomic frequency can result in an almost complete suppression of the first poincar recurrence of the excited level of the atom @xcite .",
    "this means that the atom effectively does not `` feel '' wave packets reflected from cavity mirrors for times much longer than the time necessary for emitted light to `` travel '' to the mirrors and back to the atom .",
    "another example concerns the atom which is positioned close to one of the mirrors . in general",
    "one may expect to see inhibition of the radiation .",
    "nevertheless , taking into account the position dependence of the field ",
    "atom interaction it turns out that for some specific distances from the mirror ( e.g. one quarter of the resonant wavelength of the radiation field ) , the atom decays even faster than in free space @xcite .",
    "a valuable first insight into modification of the spontaneous emission of the atom into vacuum field is offered by the fermi golden rule @xcite _ a = 2 |v_fi|^2 ( _ a ) [ golden ] .the spontaneous emission rate @xmath3 is directly proportional to the density of field modes @xmath4 in frequency domain at the atomic transition frequency @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the matrix element of the corresponding transition .",
    "the presence of boundaries ( e.g. , in the case when the atom is inserted into a high-@xmath0 microwave cavity ) changes the local density of field modes and thereby the spontaneous emission can be suppressed or enhanced .",
    "however , it is by no means necessary to change the boundary conditions of the em field in order to modify the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "this goal can be achieved easily by the presence of other atoms which can take part in absorption and re - emission of the radiation field .",
    "one important example is that of an atom embedded in a dielectric host .",
    "the main task of our investigation here concerns atom - field interactions in confined geometries . starting from `` first principles '' we simulate the dynamics of a system of atoms in a cavity .",
    "in particular , we consider a cavity filled with a `` crystal '' composed of two  level atoms .",
    "we investigate the modification of the spontaneous emission and the propagation ( scattering ) of photon wave packets within this `` crystal '' .",
    "we explore the influence of the position dependence of the atom  field coupling on the dynamics of the system . in this way",
    "also the emission and absorption in photonic band gap structures ( pbs ) @xcite with few atoms can be analyzed .",
    "our microscopic model based on `` first principles '' provides us with a deeper understanding of the atom  field interaction and offers a framework to study systematically the transition from microscopic to macroscopic ( phenomenological ) descriptions of the systems under consideration .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the modifications of spontaneous emission .",
    "we describe the model in section  [ sec2 ] . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we study position dependence of the decay of a single two - level atom and in section  [ sec4 ] we discuss the effect of inhibition of spontaneous emission .",
    "we also analyze how the dynamics of an initially excited atom is modified in the presence of other initially deexcited atoms in the cavity which play the rle of a dielectric ( see section  [ sec5 ] ) and we study in detail the time evolution of atomic populations and quantum - statistical properties of the multimode cavity field .",
    "in particular , in section  [ sec6 ] we focus our attention on the spectrum of the field .",
    "in addition we will also discuss specific technical questions such as the rle of the frequency cut - off employed here .",
    "in section  [ sec7 ] we present the convolutionless master equation describing the dynamics of the initially excited atom in dielectrics interacting with multimode cavity field .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec8 ] .",
    "we consider a simple one - dimensional model of a cavity in which two - level atoms interact with the cavity modes in the dipole and the rotating - wave approximations . to simplify the model ,",
    "we neglect all mechanical effects of the cavity field on the atom ( i.e. , the mass of the atom is assumed to be infinite ) .",
    "here we note that this 1-d model not only reflects the main features of atom  field interaction but also can be mapped onto an isotropic 3-d model .    under the assumption of perfectly reflecting mirrors ,",
    "the operator of the electric field inside the cavity in the coulomb gauge can be expressed as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the two orthogonal polarization vectors @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) lie in the plane perpendicular to the cavity axis ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are annihilation and creation operators of the @xmath14-th mode",
    ".    the hamiltonian describing the free cavity field can be expressed as @xmath15 where we have omitted the zero - point contribution @xmath16 .",
    "summation over discrete modes in eq.([hf ] ) is performed only up to @xmath17 , which means that in our model we assume a cutoff for the cavity modes .",
    "the hamiltonian describing a set of @xmath18 non - interacting ( `` free '' ) two - level atoms with transition frequencies @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the upper and lower atomic states , respectively .    when the radius of the atom is much smaller than the wavelength of the resonant electromagnetic radiation then the atom - field interaction can be described within the electric - dipole approximation , i.e. , @xmath24 . neglecting for simplicity all polarization effects ,",
    "the resulting interaction hamiltonian in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) reads @xmath25 , \\label{hint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the pauli spin - flip operators are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the position dependent coupling constants @xmath28 are given by the expression g_n^(j ) = ( ) ^1/2 d_eg^(j ) ( k_n r_j ) [ lambda ] where @xmath29 denotes the dipole matrix elements of the atoms .",
    "the position dependence of the atom - field coupling constant ( [ lambda ] ) given by space ",
    "mode functions @xmath30 may significantly affect the atomic dynamics .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the form _",
    "tot=_f+_a+ _ int [ htot ] describes the system of @xmath18 two - level atoms interacting with @xmath31 discrete field modes in 1-d cavity .",
    "this model can be solved exactly because the total number of excitations @xmath32 is an integral of motion , i.e. @xmath33=0 $ ] .    however , it is impossible in general to find a closed analytical solution for the system under consideration .",
    "just a few particular cases can be solved analytically , and among these is the well known jaynes - cummings model @xcite which describes the dynamics of a two - level atom interacting with a _ single",
    "_ mode cavity field .",
    "therefore from the very beginning our treatment will be based on a numerical simulation of the cavity qed system .",
    "our numerical treatment allows us to calculate properties of individual atoms and modes of the em field , i.e. , it retains a complete microscopic picture of the problem . the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian ( [ htot ] )",
    "can be transformed into a set of coupled linear differential equations for the amplitudes of component states ( e.g. , basis of eigenstates of bare systems ) in a finite  dimensional subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "numerical solutions can be found using standard methods , e.g. by runge  kutta methods .",
    "alternatively one can apply the direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) . numerical solution allows us to investigate processes with low initial excitation numbers ( e.g. initially just one or two atoms are excited ) .",
    "the number of cavity modes can in this case be thousands and the total number of atoms can be up to hundreds .    using numerical methods , we can analyze the time evolution of the mean values of the following observables : the occupation of the upper level of the @xmath34-th atom _ e^(j)==|e_je| .",

    "the number of excitations of the @xmath35-th mode ( k)= ^_k_k , [ spec1 ] which is used to study the spectrum of the radiation . to analyze the space - time propagation of radiation wave packets we evaluate mean values of the normally - ordered operator for the energy density @xmath36 here normal ordering ( the colons above ) is adopted to eliminate the vacuum - state contribution to the energy density of the emitted radiation .    in what follows",
    "we demonstrate the main features of the atom - field interaction in confined geometries and describe these effects : modification of spontaneous emission of the atom in the cavity due to the position dependence of the atom - field interaction .",

    "within the weisskopf  wigner theory @xcite in free space , an initially excited atom which is coupled to a continuum of _ vacuum _ field modes decays exponentially to its ground state . representing the usual 1d continuum with the discrete model ( [ hint ] ) for a large cavity ( @xmath37 )",
    ", the population of the excited atomic level @xmath38 decays exponentially with the rate @xmath3 given by the fermi golden rule ( [ golden ] ) , i.e. , p_e(t)=(-_a t ) , _",
    "a= [ decay1 ] .in 1d `` free '' space ( @xmath37 ) the decay process is accompanied by the emission of two wave packets ( representing the one - photon state ) propagating to the left and to the right from the atom . in the case of the `` left - right '' symmetry of atomic - wave functions in 1-d ( this corresponds to spherical symmetry in 3-d )",
    "each of the two wave packets carries half of the initial excitation .",
    "this process is irreversible as the energy can not be reabsorbed by the atom . in confined geometries",
    "the situation differs .",
    "first , the density of _ discrete _ modes is changed due to the boundary conditions . the translational symmetry is lost and the coupling is position - dependent . in particular ,",
    "when the atom is positioned at the center of the cavity it is coupled only to odd modes of the field ( for even modes the coupling constant ( [ lambda ] ) is equal to zero ; for more details see below ) .",
    "second , the two wave packets are reflected back by the cavity mirrors and can be ( partially ) reabsorbed by the atom .",
    "this partial restoration of the initial state of the atom , the so called poincar recurrence , can be viewed as a consequence of constructive quantum interference ( see below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] presents the time evolution of the probability of the atomic excitation for four different values of the position of the atom around the center of the cavity , namely @xmath39 . to the case when the initially excited atom is positioned in the cavity center ( dotted line )",
    "we will further refer as the `` free - space '' decay .",
    "the central atom interacts only with the odd modes and thus the density of ( interacting ) modes equals to @xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding `` free - space '' decay rate @xmath3 is given by eq.([decay1 ] ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we see that the first `` exponential '' stage of the decay is ( almost ) position independent . providing",
    "the atom is `` far '' from the mirrors , i.e. , @xmath41 , the reflected wave packets do not influence the exponential decay .",
    "more precisely , the density of modes is doubled when the atom is shifted from the cavity center .",
    "owing to the position dependence of the atom - field coupling ( [ lambda ] ) the even modes start to interact with the atom and the interaction with the odd modes decreases .",
    "considering the effective squared interaction constant as the average for two neighboring ( odd and even ) cavity modes it decreases to the half value of the squared coupling constant of the interacting modes for the atom in the cavity center .",
    "it means that even though the atom is shifted from the cavity center the fermi golden rule ( [ golden ] ) with the effective squared interaction constant and doubled density of modes leads to the same decay rate ( [ decay1 ] ) .    for large enough times",
    ", the total excitation energy of the atom is transferred to the field , which in turn is effectively in a one photon ( one excitation ) state represented by two em wave packets propagating towards the mirrors . for finite cavities at time approximately @xmath42 the wave packets are reflected by the mirrors and at @xmath43 they approach the atom , which starts to reabsorb the energy from the field .",
    "we observe the re - excitation of the atom ( i.e. the poincar recurrence can be observed ) .",
    "in contrast to the `` exponential '' stage of the atomic decay , poincar recurrences are very sensitive to small position shifts of the atom within a wavelength of the resonant atomic transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we clearly see that if the atom is positioned at the cavity center ( @xmath44 ) then at time @xmath45 a very well pronounced poincar recurrence of the atomic inversion is seen .",
    "one can say that at the moment when the poincar recurrence appears the atom `` sees '' the cavity mirrors @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , with a small shift of the atom from the cavity center to @xmath46 the first atomic recurrence is almost completely suppressed . for simplicity",
    "we consider the two emitted wave packets ( one to the left and one to the right ) as monochromatic plane waves ( at the atomic transition frequency and with the group velocity @xmath47 ) .",
    "the difference of their geometrical paths is equal to @xmath48 .",
    "this path difference results in destructive interference due to the accumulated phase difference of @xmath49 . in other words ,",
    "the atom does not `` see '' the wave packets reflected from the cavity mirrors .",
    "obviously , when the two wave packets propagate further , then after the second reflection they accumulate a phase difference of @xmath50 so the corresponding poincar recurrence can then be seen ( i.e. in this case the atom needs an elapsed time which is twice as long compared with the situation when @xmath51 to `` see '' the cavity mirrors ) .    for the case of an atom positioned at @xmath52",
    "the evolution of the atomic inversion is almost indistinguishable from the case where @xmath53 . at the time of appearance of the first poincar recurrence",
    "there is a constructive interference of the wave packets .",
    "the trivial phase shift @xmath50 results from the difference of the geometrical paths which is then equal to @xmath54 .    in the case of an atom positioned at",
    "@xmath55 the path difference is equal to @xmath56 and the first poincar recurrence is intermediate between the extreme cases ( @xmath57 ) considered above .",
    "dephasing of the wave packets by @xmath58 results in a partially reduced reabsorption .",
    "more rigorous analysis should take into account the multimode structure of the wave packets as an additional source of dephasing due to the different ( rabi ) frequencies of the modes .",
    "we next note that the second poincar recurrence associated with the second reflection from the boundaries starts simultaneously in all cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . at the time",
    "@xmath59 the wave packets are merging in - phase , i.e. their geometrical paths are equal , which results in a partial reexcitation of the atom .    summarizing this part of the description of the dynamics of the atom",
    ", we can say that while the `` exponential '' character of the decay of an excited atom inside a large cavity is not influenced by small shifts of the atomic position , the first poincar recurrence is a position - dependent interference effect .",
    "the basic features can be explained using a simple _ classical _ point of view based on two interfering monochromatic waves .",
    "this fact may be thought of as rather surprising , as mathematically the poincar recurrences can be related to the discrete nature of the cavity modes ( with equal frequency spacing ) . to be more precise , the phase - matching conditions necessary for the appearance of poincar recurrences in the atom - field system can be associated with the evolving phase factors @xmath60 of contributing eigenstates @xmath61 of the total hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) : a poincar recurrence , i.e. , a partial restoration of the initial state , can appear at time @xmath62 such that the relation @xmath63 is valid for many values of @xmath35 ( for more details see @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] we present a stroboscopic set of plots describing the space - time propagation of the energy density of the cavity field for the same physical situation ( initial state ) as considered in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] when the atom is in the center of the cavity .",
    "we see two distinct wave packets propagating to the right and to the left .",
    "reflection of the wave packets from the cavity mirrors ( at time @xmath64 ) is nicely demonstrated and the subsequent re - excitation of the atom is synchronized with the interference of the wave packets in the center of the cavity ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in the previous section we have considered situations when the atom is `` far '' from the cavity mirrors [ i.e. @xmath41 ] and the wave packets reflected by the mirrors do not directly affect the initial spontaneous decay of the atom . on the other hand , for distances between the atom and one of the cavity mirrors smaller than @xmath66 (",
    "here @xmath67 is the spontaneous decay time in a free space ) deviations from exponential decay should be expected @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the decay of a two - level atom which is positioned very close to the cavity mirror can be significantly suppressed .",
    "this effect is called the inhibition of spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "the inhibition of spontaneous emission is a position - dependent effect which is related to the position dependence of the atom - field coupling constant ( [ lambda ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present numerical simulations for the time evolution of the population of the upper level of the atom described by the model interaction hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) .",
    "the atom is assumed to be initially in its excited state and the field in the vacuum .",
    "we consider several typical physical configurations .",
    "firstly , for reference , we plot the atomic decay of the atom positioned at @xmath68 ( solid line ) which is indistinguishable from the exponential decay of the atom at the cavity center ( i.e. , @xmath69 for @xmath70 ) . for other atomic positions @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( here @xmath73 ) we clearly see that the closer the atom is to the mirror the slower the spontaneous decay is , that is the inhibition of spontaneous radiation is transparent for the considered positions of the atom . on the other hand for very specific atomic positions close to the mirror the opposite effect - the _ enhancement _ of spontaneous emission - takes place .",
    "namely , for the atomic distance @xmath74 the atom decays as @xmath75 , i.e. , it radiates twice as fast compared with the free - space case [ see the reference case @xmath68 ] .",
    "the origin of inhibition or enhancement of spontaneous emission in the context of the model used in this paper relies on the position dependence of the atom - field coupling ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath74 the spatial  mode function @xmath77 for all the modes close to the resonant frequency @xmath78 irrespective of whether @xmath14 is even or odd .",
    "this means that the density of modes is increased by a factor of two compared with the case of the atom at the cavity center @xmath44 when the modes with even @xmath14 are decoupled from the atom [ @xmath79 for even @xmath14 and @xmath80 for odd @xmath14 ] .",
    "the increased density of modes implies an enhancement of the spontaneous emission . in a similar way , when @xmath68 the spatial ",
    "mode function @xmath82 for all @xmath14 around the atomic transition frequency .",
    "however , the decrease of the squared interaction constants is compensated for by an increase in the density of interacting modes ( compared with the atom at the cavity center ) and thus the spontaneous emission rate retains the value @xmath3 . for the other extreme case @xmath83 all modes around @xmath78 are significantly decoupled from the atom [ now @xmath84 which results in the dramatic inhibition of the spontaneous emission as seen in fig .  [ fig2 ] . for other positions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( @xmath85 ) the slowing of the spontaneous emission rate is given by the factor @xmath86 .",
    "we note that in the case @xmath71 the atom decays completely while for @xmath87 the exponential decay law is interrupted by the poincar recurrence at @xmath88 .    for distances of the atom from the mirror larger than the wavelength of the resonant transition @xmath54 the interference with the reflected wave packet can either stimulate or suppress the emission of the atom .",
    "to be specific we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the time evolution of the population of the upper level of the atom which is positioned at three distances @xmath89 ( dashed line ) ; @xmath90 ( dotted line ) ; and @xmath91 ( dashed - dotted line ) which are compared with the exponential decay of the atom in the cavity center ( solid line ) .",
    "the phase accumulated by the wave packet during the round trip from the atom to the neighboring mirror and back is in the case @xmath89 equal approximately to @xmath92 ( here the additional contribution of @xmath49 is due to the reflection from the mirror ) , i.e. there is a destructive interference between the wave packet and the atom which results in the suppression of the radiation . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath90 the accumulated phase is approximately @xmath93 , which leads to constructive interference .",
    "it means that the reflected wave packet , when it arrives at the position of the atom , starts to stimulate the atomic emission . in the units used in this simulation ,",
    "the arrival time of the reflected wave packet is at approximately @xmath94 which coincides with the change of the initial exponential decay of the atom . when the atom is at the position @xmath91 , the accumulated phase of the reflected wave packet is @xmath95 which gives rise to a partial suppression of radiation .",
    "atomic radiation can be crucially modified by the presence of other atoms in the cavity .",
    "obviously , if the distance between the atoms is large enough then the exponential decay of the originally excited atom is not affected significantly . on the other hand",
    "when the atoms are placed close together the situation is different ( one of the consequences is a collective behavior of the atoms which might result in superradiance , see for instance @xcite ) .    in this section we consider a specific initial condition when the initially excited atom is surrounded by a collection of two - level atoms in the ground state .",
    "these additional atoms can be considered as a linear `` crystal '' . by changing the density of the atoms we can model systems such as atomic structures embedded in optical lattices ( for interatomic distances comparable with the wavelength of the atomic transition ) or dielectrics ( for much smaller interatomic distances ) .",
    "the cavity qed system with trapped atoms @xcite represents a quite new experimental system .",
    "the transfer of excitations between particular atoms which are captured in an optical potential is mediated by the cavity field @xcite .",
    "the modification of the spontaneous emission of the atom embedded in a linear `` crystal '' of two  level atoms is shown in fig .",
    "the regular crystal built of @xmath96 atoms fills the central part of the cavity .",
    "initially the only excited atom is located at the cavity center and decays in the vacuum field .",
    "the modification of the spontaneous emission depends dramatically on the interatomic distance @xmath97 . in the case of the `` lattice '' constant being @xmath98 ( long dashed line ) we can observe strong suppression of the spontaneous emission while for @xmath99 ( short dashed line ) an enhancement of radiation compared with the single atom system ( dotted line ) takes place .",
    "the origin of this behavior is related to either destructive or constructive interference effects , respectively . from other examples , for @xmath100 ( solid line ) and @xmath101 ( dot  dashed line )",
    "it is seen that by increasing the density of the linear `` crystal '' the atom radiates more slowly .",
    "moreover , the de - excitation is incomplete , as an increasing part of the excitation is captured by the initial state .",
    "this subradiant behavior has been already analyzed for the extreme case when all the atoms are located at the same position ( e.g. , the cavity center ) @xcite .",
    "the initial excitation is captured in the asymmetric atomic state and only a small part @xmath102 is radiated in the cavity field .",
    "the regular `` crystal '' represents a rather specific and idealized case .",
    "positions of atoms can fluctuate due to various reasons ( for example in the case of optical lattices with shallow wells formed from optical potentials ) .",
    "to simulate the situation when the atoms are not regularly distributed in the cavity we next consider random configurations of the atoms .",
    "specifically , the atoms are placed randomly such that within each lattice constant there is just one atom .",
    "depending on the particular positions of the atoms , the dynamics of the originally excited atom can change dramatically .",
    "the atomic radiation can be either enhanced or suppressed . to obtain some effective `` macroscopic '' picture from our simulations ,",
    "we have averaged over many random configurations .",
    "we present the results in fig .",
    "the dashed ( dotted ) line in this figure shows the time evolution of the atomic population of the initially excited atom when the atoms are regularly positioned with the lattice constant @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , representing enhancement ( suppression ) of radiation with respect to the `` free - space '' decay ( solid line ) .",
    "the results of numerical simulations corresponding to averaging over many ( 100 ) random configurations of atoms are presented for the average distance between atoms @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) . in both cases the radiation of the atom",
    "is suppressed compared with the `` free - space '' decay .",
    "another common feature of the dynamics in this case is that in both cases the atom does not radiate away completely the initial excitation energy .",
    "both effects ( suppression of radiation and `` excitation trapping '' ) are caused by the collective influence of the crystal atoms .",
    "an increase of the density of the linear `` crystal '' ( e.g. for @xmath101 ) rapidly diminishes differences between the regular crystal and the corresponding `` random '' crystal with one atom randomly positioned within the lattice constant . for completeness",
    "we included in fig.[fig5 ] also the case of the regular `` crystal '' with @xmath98 ( ) and the average over random configurations with @xmath107 . here",
    "the destructive interference effect which leads to the strong inhibition of the radiation for the regular crystal is deteriorated for random atomic configurations shown in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "we note that the modification of the spontaneous emission is a local effect , i.e. , the atomic decay is influenced only by neighboring atoms . to check this we have performed simulations with only 10 neighboring atoms ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we have found that the `` exponential '' stage of the spontaneous emission is unchanged comparing with the case @xmath96 , and differences occur only on a much longer time scale .",
    "it is instructive to note that part of the initial excitation energy is captured in the atomic system .",
    "in particular , the sum of atomic excitations @xmath109 depends mainly on the number of atoms @xmath18 .",
    "this tendency is confirmed in fig .",

    "nevertheless one can trace a very general tendency in the picture - the `` crystal '' atoms which surround the initially excited atom play the rle of semi - transparent mirrors placed very close to the atom .",
    "therefore the results partially resemble the case of the single atom in the vicinity of a mirror ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "within the framework of cavity qed when the field interacting with the atoms is confined within ideal mirrors , there is nothing like a stationary regime which is necessary for the derivation of a time - independent spectrum of the field .",
    "the spectrum is intrinsically time dependent . in this case",
    "an operational definition of time - dependent spectrum can be given by excitation probabilities of the cavity modes [ see eq.([spec1 ] ) ] .",
    "the spectrum of the cavity field is affected by the position of the atom .",
    "in particular , if the atom is located in the cavity center even modes are completely decoupled from the atom and only odd modes can become excited [ see eq.([lambda ] ) ] establishing in this way oscillations in the spectrum of modes .",
    "however , at the point when the total excitation energy of the atom is transferred to the field , the _ envelope _ of the spectrum is `` lorentzian '' irrespective of the position of the atom ( providing that the decay is exponential ) .    on the other hand",
    ", it should be stressed that the spectrum of the interacting modes is highly transient even during the exponential decay period .",
    "it undergoes a gradual narrowing from a broad flat spectrum ( initially all modes are in the vacuum state with the same probability ) towards a lorentzian - like line of width @xmath3 .",
    "the narrowing is accompanied by transient oscillations of the spectral envelope .",
    "this transient behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] which shows the spectral envelopes at different time moments during the exponential decay of the atomic excitation . at the time @xmath111 the envelope of the cavity - field spectrum reaches its quasi - stationary shape , being very close to the corresponding ( lorentzian ) emission spectrum usually associated with the free - space emission @xcite .    2    it is worth noticing that there is a close relation between the emission spectrum and the `` spectrum '' of squared scalar products ( overlaps ) between eigenvectors @xmath112 of the total hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) and the given initial state @xmath113 , i.e. , s_e(k)=|(t_0 ) | _ k |^2 .",
    "from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] it is evident that the `` spectrum '' of overlaps ( shown as @xmath114 ) resembles the emission spectrum of the completely deexcited atom . in other words ,",
    "the `` spectrum '' of overlaps offers an important time - independent characteristization of the system under consideration .",
    "if there exists a quasi - stationary spectrum of the cavity modes , it should mimic the `` spectrum '' of overlaps .",
    "in addition , a shift of the atomic transition frequency in the spectrum of eigenvalues can be associated with the energy shift . in our calculations",
    "we use a broadband approximation , in which the frequency dependence of the atom - field coupling can be neglected .",
    "thus for the symmetrical upper frequency cutoff @xmath115 the energy shift equals zero .",
    "we next turn our attention to the fact that an additional system of two  level atoms with different transition frequencies @xmath19 inside the cavity can serve as a device to measure the spectrum of the cavity modes . within this model of measurement",
    "the initially deexcited ( analyzer ) atoms are placed far enough from the decaying atom .",
    "the coupling of the analyzer atoms to the cavity modes is so weak that the dynamics of the cavity field is essentially unaffected on the relevant time scale .",
    "it means that the linewidths of the analyzer atoms are much smaller than the linewidth @xmath3 of the decaying atom .",
    "the analyzer atoms with different transition frequencies @xmath19 thus function as narrow frequency filters interacting effectively only with the cavity modes on exact resonance with particular @xmath19 .",
    "the upper level excitation probabilities of the analyzer atoms are proportional to the intensity of the cavity field at the position of the analyzer atoms @xcite . in order to map the excitations of analyzer atoms to the spectrum of the cavity",
    "modes it is necessary to demand that the coupling constants ( linewidths ) of the analyzer atoms are equal . in general ,",
    "the analyzer atoms give the local and time dependent frequency spectrum which is not necessarily the same as excitations of cavity modes ( [ spec1 ] ) which give the `` instantaneous '' spectrum in the whole cavity . in the case of the atomic decay",
    "the two spectra agree if the times they are read out from the analyzer atoms and the modes are chosen appropriately .",
    "the normalized absorption spectrum read out from the analyzer atoms is show in fig .",
    "[ fig7b ] .",
    "here we have considered that the decay rates ( i.e. linewidths ) @xmath116 of the analyzer atoms are mutually equal and @xmath117 .",
    "a bunch of one hundred of analyzer atoms is positioned @xmath118 apart of the decaying atom in the cavity center .",
    "the atomic frequencies @xmath19 are equally spaced around the transition frequency @xmath78 of the central atom .",
    "we see very good agreement with the _ envelope _ of the spectrum of the cavity modes .",
    "more precisely , in fig .",
    "[ fig7b ] we compare the spectrum of the cavity modes at times @xmath119 and @xmath120 with the absorption spectrum of the analyzer atoms at delayed times @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the time of flight of the light from the decaying ( central ) atom to the analyzer atoms .",
    "our numerical calculations have been performed in the broadband approximation for the interaction constants given by eq.([lambda ] ) , i.e. , we have neglected the frequency dependence of the coupling constants replacing @xmath123 by @xmath78 .",
    "this approximation is valid only for large enough cavities with @xmath124 and `` weak '' interaction regimes with @xmath125 .",
    "a rather subtle point is the choice of the frequency cutoff . strictly speaking",
    ", the model interaction hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) with the interaction constants ( [ lambda ] ) within the broadband approximation leads in second - order perturbation theory to _ logarithmically _ divergent energy shifts for @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "( note that in our numerical calculations we have eliminated the shift of the excited atomic level by choosing a symmetrical frequency cutoff @xmath115 . ) without the broadband approximation , when the frequency dependence of the interaction constants ( [ lambda ] ) is taken into account , the energy shifts diverge _ linearly_. it is well known @xcite that if instead of the dipole approximation @xmath24 we start with @xmath127 then after the rwa is applied one obtains the interaction hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) but with a different frequency dependence of the interaction constant , i.e. g_n^(j ) = ( ) ^1/2 d_eg^(j)(k_n r_j ) .[lambda2 ] in the broadband approximation the interaction constants given by eq.([lambda ] ) and eq.([lambda2 ] ) are identical and the results do not depend on the choice of the interaction hamiltonian .",
