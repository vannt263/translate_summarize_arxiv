    "<S> we study the lhc search constraints on models that extend the standard model ( sm ) with an inert , complex scalar electroweak multiplet , @xmath0 , with isospin @xmath1 ( sextet ) or @xmath2 ( octet ) and identical hypercharge to the sm higgs doublet . imposing a global @xmath3 symmetry under which @xmath4 , the lightest member of @xmath0 is stable and we require that it be neutral ( @xmath5 ) to avoid cosmological constraints from charged relics . </S>",
    "<S> pair production of scalars by electroweak interactions followed by cascade decays to @xmath5 through @xmath6 and @xmath7 emission produces signatures similar to those of supersymmetric electroweak gauginos , and we constrain the models by recasting a collection of such searches made with data from the 8  tev run of the lhc . we find that there is no sensitivity from these searches to the compressed spectrum regime , in which the mass splittings between the lightest and heaviest states in @xmath0 are less than about 20  gev . in the remaining parameter space , we find significant exclusions for @xmath8  gev in the sextet model , and @xmath9  gev in the octet model . </S>"
