    "in the hierarchical model of structure formation , gravitational collapse and the accelerating cosmic expansion are two competing effects which determine the rate at which structures , such as galaxies and clusters , grow in the universe .",
    "in addition to the hubble flow , galaxies possess peculiar velocities , arising from inhomogeneities in the local density field , which can be used to probe the growth rate of structure @xcite .",
    "these peculiar velocities distort the clustering signal along the line of sight giving rise to redshift space distortions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been shown that a key ingredient to improve models of the power spectrum in redshift space is the inclusion of the nonlinear velocity divergence power spectrum @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present an improvement to the model for both the auto and cross velocity divergence power spectrum presented in @xcite .",
    "the refinement of the model is driven by using a volume weighted delaunay tesselation method to measure the nonlinear velocity fields to greater accuracy and to smaller scales then presented in @xcite .",
    "measurements of the growth rate of structure can be used to determine if the accelerating expansion is the result of a dark energy component which behaves as a repulsive form of gravity or if einstein s theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". independent measurements of the growth rate can be obtained by measuring the clustering of galaxies in redshift space and recently there has been renewed interest in improving the models for the clustering signal in redshift space @xcite .",
    "also recently it has been pointed out that the velocity divergence power spectrum is a more sensitive probe of modified gravity than the nonlinear matter power spectrum @xcite but models for the 2d redshift space power spectrum are currently not accurate enough to allow this quantity to be extracted to a high precision .",
    "however , given an accurate model for the velocity divergence power spectrum in a @xmath11cdm cosmology , this can be used to construct predictions for the moments of the power spectrum in redshift space which can be directly compared with data and has been shown to be accurate in detecting deviations from general relativity using simulations @xcite .    the linear continuity equation , @xmath13 , gives a one to one correspondence between the velocity and density fields where the linear growth rate @xmath14 is a cosmology dependent factor , @xmath15 is the matter overdensity , @xmath16 is the peculiar velocity and @xmath17 is the hubble parameter .",
    "once overdensities become nonlinear , this relationship no longer holds .",
    "@xcite derived the nonlinear relation between @xmath15 and @xmath18 in the case of an initially gaussian field .",
    "many authors since then have extended this relation using e.g. higher order pertubation theory or the spherical collapse model ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite were the first to apply numerical simulations to model the nonlinear velocity and density spectra , instead of using perturbation theory . using a grid - based pressureless hydrodynamic code their simulations",
    "had limited resolution but were able to fit the ratios up to @xmath19mpc@xmath2 and show that perturbative predictions fail at @xmath20mpc@xmath2 .    the density velocity relation considered in this paper",
    "was first presented in @xcite , where the parameters were obtained by fitting to a mass weighted measurement of the velocity divergence field . in this paper",
    "we present updated parameters obtained by fitting to the volume weighted velocity divergence power spectra which have been measured accurately on smaller scales than was possible with the mass weighted method @xcite .",
    "we also show that the model proposed by @xcite for the redshift dependence of the density velocity relation recovers the velocity power spectra at @xmath7 with greater precision using the new parameters .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sims ] we describe the @xmath12-body simulations used in this paper . in section  [ measuring_v ]",
    "we discuss two methods for measuring the velocity divergence power spectrum . in section [ results ]",
    "we present the main results of this paper including the updated parameters for the nonlinear velocity divergence power spectra .",
    "in section [ sims ] we present the details of the n - body simulations carried out and discuss several methods which can be used to measure the velocity divergence power spectrum in section [ measuring_v ] .",
    "we focus on a delaunay tesselation approach and show the accuracy which with this method can recover @xmath3 and @xmath21 .",
    "= 13.5truecm    [ sims ]    we use the n - body simulations carried out by @xcite .",
    "these simulations were performed at the institute of computational cosmology using a modified version of the mesh - based @xmath12-body code ramses @xcite . assuming a @xmath11cdm cosmology , the following cosmological parameters were used in the simulations : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and a spectral tilt of @xmath25 ( in agreement with e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the linear theory rms fluctuation in spheres of radius 8 @xmath26 mpc is set to be @xmath27 .",
    "the simulations use @xmath28 dark matter particles to represent the matter distribution in a computational box of comoving length @xmath29mpc .",
    "the initial conditions were generated at @xmath30 using the @xcite code .",
    "note the nonlinear matter power spectrum is measured from the simulations by assigning the particles to a mesh using the cloud in cell ( cic ) assignment scheme and performing a fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the density field . to compensate for the mass assignment scheme we perform an approximate de - convolution following @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    "the velocity divergence is normalized to @xmath31 , where @xmath16 is the peculiar velocity , @xmath32 is the linear growth rate , @xmath17 is the hubble parameter and @xmath33 is the scale factor .",
    "using this normalization @xmath34 is dimensionless and the linear continuity equation is given by @xmath35 .",

    "some volume weighted measures of the velocity field have also been developed ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) including the delaunay tessellation field estimator ( dtfe ) method @xcite .",
    "= 13.5truecm    in the mass weighted approach , simply interpolating the velocities to a grid , as suggested by @xcite , gives the momentum field which is then fourier transformed and divided by the fourier transform of the density field , which results in a mass weighted velocity field on the grid .",
    "one of the main problems with this approach is that the velocity field is artifically set to zero in regions where there are no particles , as the density is zero in these empty cells .",
    "@xcite also found that this method does not accurately recover the input velocity divergence power spectrum on scales @xmath36mpc@xmath2 interpolating the velocities of 640@xmath37 particles to a @xmath38 grid .",
    "using simulations of 1024@xmath37 particles in a 1.5@xmath26gpc box , @xcite found that the maximum grid size that could be used was 350@xmath37 without reaching the limit of empty cells .",
    "the limit on the maximum grid size which can be used in a mass weighted estimate of @xmath34 means that the velocity divergence @xmath8 presented in @xcite is only accurate on large scales @xmath10mpc@xmath2 .",
    "also , it is not clear on what scales the discrepancy between the actual and measured velocity divergence power spectrum , which was found by @xcite on scales @xmath39mpc@xmath2 ( see figure @xmath40 in that paper ) , is present in the velocity @xmath8 measured by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite find that the measured @xmath3 and @xmath21 agree with the linear continuity equation on large scales within the errors from eight simulations ( see figure @xmath41 in that work ) .",
    "the limitations of using the mass weighted method to measure @xmath3 implies that the fitting formula presented in @xcite is only valid over a limited range of scales .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to present an improved version of the formula for @xmath3 and @xmath21 given by @xcite by fitting to power spectra which have been measured using the dtfe method this code constructs the delaunay tessellation from a discrete set of points and interpolates the field values onto a user defined grid . for the @xmath42 mpc simulation",
    "we generate the velocity auto , @xmath3 , and cross power spectrum , @xmath43 , on a @xmath44 grid .",
    "the velocity divergence field is interpolated onto the grid by randomly sampling the field values at a given number of sample points within the delaunay cells and than taking the average of those values .",
    "the resolution of the mesh used in this study means that mass assignment effects are negligible on the scales of interest here .    in fig .",

    "plotting the ratio in this way removes the sampling variance @xcite and shows the agreement of the measured velocity and matter @xmath8 with the predictions of the linear continuity equation on large scales , @xmath50mpc@xmath2 for @xmath46 and @xmath51mpc@xmath2 for @xmath45 .",
