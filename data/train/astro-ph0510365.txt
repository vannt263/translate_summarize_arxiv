    "subdwarfs are galactic fossils that provide answers to questions concerning the age of the milky way , its early composition , the rate of star formation at early epochs , and the galaxy s overall construction by the cannibalism of nearby small galaxies .",
    "subdwarfs of k and m types are presumably the most numerous stellar components of the early galaxy , yet they are the types least studied because of their low luminosities .",
    "subdwarfs are notoriously far more rare than disk stars , and therefore harder to identify and study . for example , of the 243 stellar systems now known within 10 pc of the sun , only two are confirmed subdwarf systems ( with accurate parallax and spectra ) : @xmath1 cas ab ( gj 53 ab , [ fe / h]@xmath20.71 , @xcite ) and cf uma ( gj 451 , [ m / h]@xmath21.44 , @xcite )    although they are difficult to find , a widely applied strategy used to identify subdwarfs , selecting stars with high proper motions , can yield a rich sample of subdwarf candidates that can be targeted for more detailed observations .",
    "selection by proper motion is highly successful because old stars tend to have large heliocentric velocities after billions of years of `` heating '' from many passages through the galactic disk .",
    "for example , schmidt ( 1975 ) , gizis and reid ( 1999 ) , and digby ( 2003 ) have used high proper motion criteria to select potential subdwarfs and to determine the subdwarf luminosity function .",
    "however , we have found that only 19 ( 33% ) of schmidt s 57 subdwarf candidates are , in fact , spectroscopically confirmed subdwarfs @xcite , illustrating the significant contamination of proper motion samples by disk stars .",
    "two observations are required to scrub samples of potential low mass subdwarfs of interlopers : ( 1 ) trigonometric parallax observations to confirm that candidates lie 1 - 3 magnitudes below the main sequence , and ( 2 ) spectroscopic observations to confirm that candidates have low metallicity ( strength of the cah and tio bands in particular for the cool subdwarfs ) .",
    "some subdwarf candidates have been identified by one of these observations , but within 60 pc there are currently only 58 k and m type subdwarfs confirmed by both types of observations ( jao 2004 ) .",
    "white dwarfs ( wds ) are the end products of the evolution of stars with masses of 1 @xmath3 to 8 @xmath3 . if we consider any typical initial stellar mass function , it is instantly clear that this makes wds the most common end state of stellar evolution . because of their large numbers , ability to be modeled effectively , and age dispersion spanning our galaxy s entire history , wds provide important , interpretable clues about galactic timescales .",
    "this potential was recognized many years ago by @xcite in a study of star formation rates .",
    "many developments have occurred since then in both observational and theoretical studies of wds .",
    "observationally , with modern telescopes we have been able to detect fainter objects , giving us more detailed information on the cool , old wds ( @xcite ) , including those in globular clusters that are used to determine cluster ages @xcite .",
    "recent observations also suggest that an ancient wd population could exist in the galactic halo that may constitute an important part of the baryonic dark matter @xcite , although this is still rigorously debated ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , models ( @xcite , @xcite ) continue to improve our understanding of wds , in particular for the cool wds that are members of the galactic thick disk or halo .    during our southern parallax program ctiopi ( cerro tololo inter - american observatory parallax investigation ) ,",
    "we have stumbled upon two unusual wds in systems with red subdwarfs , lhs 193ab and lhs 300ab10 and l395@xmath413 identifiers , respectively , in the new luyten two - tenth ( nltt ) catalogue . however , in order to keep consistent with the ids we used in @xcite , the lhs ids will be used throughout this manuscript . ] ( jao et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these two systems contain the first wds ever found to have confirmed subdwarf companions , based on accurate parallax and spectroscopy , thereby giving us powerful insight into the nature of old wds in low metallicity systems .",
    "two other systems like these have been mentioned in the literature , gj 781ab @xcite and lhs 2139/2140 @xcite , but both are speculative , being based on broad spectral features plus mass functions in unresolved binaries and noisy spectra of one component , respectively . a third system , reported in @xcite , has been spectroscopically confirmed but no parallax is available .",
    "table 1 lists all of these systems as well as new candidate systems discussed in section 5 . in this work we present a detailed analysis of the only two such resolved systems with parallaxes , including photometric and spectroscopic observations and estimates of the wds physical parameters . using models from the literature",
    ", we then use the physical parameters of the wds to estimate their ages , and thereby provide a link between these old objects and their low metallicity red subdwarf counterparts .",
    "finally , we discuss the results in the context of galactic stellar populations .",
    "initial @xmath5 ( hereafter , subscripts not shown ) photometry observations for lhs 193ab and lhs 300ab were reported in @xcite .",
    "data were taken at the ctio 0.9 m telescope , using a 1024@xmath61024 tek ccd with image scale 0@xmath7401 pixel@xmath8 during ctiopi .",
    "an additional @xmath9 observation set was recently acquired for lhs 300ab , and improved deconvolution techniques allow us to improve the photometry values for components in both systems .",
    "the aperture sizes applied to lhs 193b ( aperture 4 , separation 126 ) and lhs 300b ( aperture 2 , separation 43 ) in @xcite were large enough to include contaminating flux from the primary stars wings .",
    "a 1  aperture size is now used for the wd components in both systems , and the results are given table 2 .",
    "these improved results indicate that the two white dwarfs are not quite as red as reported in @xcite , although they are still among the reddest wds known , as can be seen in figure 1 . in order to test the reliability of the small aperture photometry",
    ", we compared the results with those obtained by performing psf fitting and removal of the bright primary component of each system and then recalculating the photometry .",
    "results from both methods were entirely consistent within the observational errors .",
    "the final signal - to - noise errors in @xmath9 for the red dwarf components are 0.001 mag , whereas for the wds the errors are 0.04 mag and the total errors are ( including signal to noise , systematics and night - to - night variabily ) 0.03 for the sds and 0.05 for the wds .",
    "infrared photometry of the lhs 193 and lhs 300 systems in the @xmath10 bands ( standard cit / ctio filters ) have been obtained using the andicam detector at the ctio 1.3 m telescope via smarts time .",
    "the ir array for andicam is a rockwell 1024@xmath61024 hgcdte hawaii array with 18-micron pixels , providing an image scale of 0@xmath7137 pixel@xmath8 and a field of view of 2@xmath114@xmath62@xmath114 .",
    "observations made before february 2005 have a missing quadrant in the upper right corner due to a chip malfunction that has since been fixed .    the observations were carried out with the intent of doing differential photometry using reference stars with well determined 2mass magnitudes . to optimize image quality we used a dithering pattern with offsets of 15 .",
    "because of the limited field of view , there were only 1 and 3 suitable reference stars for lhs 193b and lhs 300b , respectively , but all four reference stars have 2mass @xmath12 magnitude errors of less than 0.04 .",
    "these reference stars were also checked for photometric stability by using already existing frames from the long term ctiopi parallax project ",
    "they showed no signs of variability larger than 0.02 mag in the optical ( and presumably even less in the infrared ) .",
    "the 2mass photometry has been converted to the cit system by using the second generation relations from @xcite .",
    "the images were corrected for bias and flat - fielded using standard iraf procedures .",
    "the reduced science frames were used to obtain aperture photometry in interactive data language ( idl ) .",
    "the reason for adopting idl in this step was the necessity to remove precisely the contribution of the primary components in the lhs 193 and lhs 300 systems by fitting the non - uniform background and subtracting it .",
    "even in the case lhs 193 , where the separation is 12@xmath76 , the contribution of the primary component s wings is substantial at the location of the secondary , especially given the great magnitude difference of these two components ( @xmath137 magnitudes at @xmath14 ) .",
    "after subtraction , the aperture photometry of the faint secondary components and reference stars was completed using a series of apertures with radii of 3 to 9 pixels in steps of 0.5 pixels .",
    "the final adopted magnitude was the average of all these values with the uncertainty given by the standard deviation of the mean ( 0.08 mag for @xmath14 and 0.1 mag for @xmath15 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of lhs 193ab and lhs 300ab were made with the 1.5-m and 4-m telescopes at ctio , respectively .",
    "for the observations on the 1.5-m , the r - c spectrograph with a loral 1200@xmath6800 ccd camera was used with the # 32 grating ( in first order ) at tilt 15.1@xmath16 .",
    "the order - blocking filter og570 was used , resulting in spectra covering 6000  to 9500  with a resolution of 8.6 . at the 4.0-m ,",
    "the r - c spectrograph with a loral 3k@xmath61k ccd was used with the # 181 grating ( in first order ) at tilt 58.8@xmath16 .",
    "the order - blocking filter og515 was used , resulting in spectra covering 5500  to 10000  with a resolution of 6 . the fringing effect on the 4-m spectra at wavelengths",
    "longer than @xmath137000  has been removed by customized idl routines .",
    "reductions were carried out in the standard way using iraf reduction packages .",
    "wavelength and flux calibrations were done using _ twodspec.apextract _ within iraf .",
    "results are shown in figure [ spec_comp ] .",
    "because of the wide separation of the lhs 193ab system , the spectra were observed separately for each component .",
    "however , the spectrum labelled lhs 300a in figure [ spec_comp ] is actually a combined spectrum .",
    "the contamination is negligible given the large magnitude difference between the two components ( @xmath17 4.6 , @xmath18 4.9 , @xmath19 5.0 ) .",
    "a spectrum of lhs 300b only was obtained by carefully aligning the slit , although some contamination from the primary is still present .",
    "a sample of cool subdwarfs was previously studied by @xcite , who showed that the subdwarf absorption bands of cahn ( n@xmath201 - 3 ) and tio are the best features to separate subdwarfs from main sequence stars between 6000  and 9000  ( our spectral coverage ) . here",
    "we apply the same spectroscopic index method for both primary stars , lhs 193a and lhs 300a .",
    "results are presented in figure  [ fig : cah.tio ] .",
    "the spectroscopic indices show that both stars fall in the early m type subdwarf region . when combined with the hr diagram results shown in figure  [ hrdiag ] , the two pieces of evidence confirm , unequivocally , that lhs 193a and lhs 300a are subdwarfs .",
    "spectra for each of the white dwarf secondaries are presented in figure 2 .",
    "both spectra are noisy because these objects are faint , but lhs 193b shows no apparent features except for the telluric lines seen in all the spectra in figure 2 .",
    "lhs 300b does show some continuum structure , especially in the red region of the spectrum due to contamination from the bright primary .",
    "one prominent feature seen close to @xmath21 does not have the same width as the corresponding one in the primary component and no trace of the other two lines of the caii triplet , to which it should belong , are present , indicating that it is probably due to residual cosmic rays .",
    "these objects would be traditionally classified as featureless dc white dwarfs .",
    "ideally , higher s / n spectra are desirable to deconvolve any trace hydrogen absorption from the noise should it exist ( h@xmath22 is within this spectral coverage at 6563 a ) .",
    "we tentatively conclude that neither wd spectrum has hydrogen absorption features , which justifies the use of helium - rich models to characterize these objects , as discussed in the next section .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of wds in general is that they provide us with a means of determining the age of the system to which they belong .",
    "this is possible because the physics of wd cooling is relatively well - understood and unhindred by assumptions about nuclear reaction rates , among others , allowing for reliable models to be constructed .",
    "many models have been published in the literature for the cooling of wds over the past several years ( see for example @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and @xcite among others ) .",
    "our goal in this section is to estimate the _ total _ ages of the lhs 193 and lhs 300 systems by summing each wd s cooling age and its main sequence lifetime .",
    "the set of models described in @xcite is used here to determine the cooling ages , as well as other stellar parameters .",
    "the choice of this model in particular is due to the fact that the author provides complete grids for various photometric filters and physical quantities of the wds , making it possible to use interpolation procedures to get physical parameters from observed photometrical values . with these results ,",
    "we utilize the initial to final mass relations of @xcite and @xcite to estimate the progenitor masses and consequent main sequence lifetimes .",
    "a modern revision of such relations is presented by @xcite where they suggest a new form for this function . however , this revised relation is not significantly different from the one of @xcite , which we adopt here for consistency with the discussion of @xcite .",
    "the models of @xcite provide us with bolometric corrections and color indices on various photometric systems calculated for an extensive grid of hydrogen- ( da)and helium - rich ( non - da ) white dwarf model atmospheres .",
    "absolute visual magnitudes , masses , and ages are obtained for each model from detailed evolutionary cooling sequences . for each set of filters ,",
    "grids are calculated for da and non - da atmosphere models .",
    "the da model grid covers a range from @xmath23 to @xmath24 and from @xmath25 = 7.0 to 9.0 , while the non - da model grid covers a range from @xmath26 to @xmath27 and from @xmath25 = 7.0 to 9.0 .",
    "the grids are available for public use at : _",
    "http://www.astro.umontreal.ca/~bergeron / coolingmodels/_.    one important step in this procedure is to decide which set of models to use for the interpolation required to match observed parameters for each wd .",
    "photometry alone is not enough to decide between da or non - da model atmospheres and spectroscopy should always be available to pinpoint the type of wd being studied .",
    "this is very important , especially for age determinations , because cooling times are strongly dependent on the type of model considered , i.e.  non - da models give different cooling ages for a given position in the ( @xmath28)@xmath6@xmath29 plane than the da models . in the case of lhs 193b and lhs 300b ,",
    "both spectra show no evidence of hydrogen lines ( as discussed in section 3 ) , indicating very low abundance of the element in the atmosphere .",
    "thus , they were both studied with he model atmospheres .",
    "we estimate the physical characteristics and ages of the wd components using the @xmath30 photometry for lhs 193b and lhs 300b . to map the wds into the model grids , we interpolated values in the ( @xmath31 , @xmath29 ) , ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , ( @xmath32 , @xmath29 ) , ( @xmath33 , @xmath29 ) planes for each object to find their surface gravities , effective temperatures , masses , and cooling ages .",
    "the independent determinations from these color combinations are then averaged to obtain a final value for each parameter .",
    "the routines take the regularly - gridded set of models and use a smooth quintic surface for the interpolation .",
    "the result is s a two - dimensional floating - point array containing the interpolated surface , sampled at the grid points .",
    "the color amd absolute magnitude combinations discussed above are then interpolated on this surface using cubic convolution interpolation . for more detail on the interpolation routines",
    "see idl manual and documentation .",
    "results are given in table 3 .",
    "the reason for utilizing the values for ( @xmath31 ) , ( @xmath28 ) , ( @xmath32 ) , ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath29 is simply due to the nature of the model grids available and their properties .",
    "other relations can be constructed but are of limited use because of overlapping curves for different surface gravity values , thereby introducing degeneracies . as an example",
    ", one could use the ( @xmath28 , @xmath34 ) relation if these photometric values are available .",
    "however , if we plot the model grid for these parameters , we see that the curves for different surface gravity values overlap for some sections of the diagram ( as shown in figure  [ mod_degen ] ) .",
    "consequently , this particular color - color diagram is degenerate and would not provide meaningful results .    to determine the reliability of our method we compared our results with those of a `` control '' wd , gj 283a with type dq , which is the primary star of a binary system with an m6.0v main sequence red dwarf companion .",
    "this provides two opportunities for comparison  the wd has also been evaluated by @xcite so we can check the consistency of results , and the main sequence red dwarf is likely much younger than the red subdwarfs , lhs 193a and lhs 300a , so we should determine a younger cooling age for gj 283a . using our method and the observed values from @xcite for gj 283a , we find differences of 1% in surface gravity , 4% in temperature , 14% in mass and 10% in cooling age .",
    "these differences are likely due to the nature of the interpolation process and on model grid resolution ; we conclude that our procedure is sound .",
    "derived cooling ages and other physical parameters for all three white dwarfs are listed in table 3 .",
    "we confirm that the gj 283 system is significantly younger than the lhs 193 and lhs 300 systems .",
    "using relations presented in @xcite , we can estimate the progenitor masses of the wds and their main sequence lifetimes via the following equations :    @xmath35    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the mass of the white dwarf , a and b are constants ( see description below ) , @xmath38 is the mass of the progenitor ( both masses in solar units ) , and @xmath39 is the main sequence lifetime in @xmath40 .",
    "the constants in equation 1 need to be defined so that a value of @xmath38 can be determined . in this work we adopted three different prescriptions for these constants ,",
    "two from @xcite and one is from @xcite .",
    "the two prescriptions from @xcite are the ones referred to in that work as model d ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) and model e ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "model d in particular is what the author defines as the `` best guess model '' .",
    "the third prescription uses the initial  final mass relation defined by @xcite . in this work",
    "we refer to these different prescriptions as wood d , wood e and iben 89 , respectively .",
    "the choice of these particular models is based on the theoretical mass functions obtained from them . as mentioned in @xcite , the best fit to the observed mass function",
    "is achieved using wood d. wood e and iben 89 are included as independent checks on the progenitor masses and main sequence lifetimes .",
    "results for all three methods are given in table 3 .",
    "the total ages of lhs 193b and lhs 300b are simply the sums of their main sequence lifetimes and their cooling ages , i.e.  @xmath45 and @xmath39 given in table 3 . given the various uncertainties in the methods used to determine both portions of the wds @xmath46 ages , we conclude that both systems have ages of 6 - 9 gyr . by proxy , we conclude that the low metallicity subdwarf components have the same ages as their wd partners , thereby providing a link between wd ages and red dwarf metalicities .",
    "given the utility of these wd - subdwarf pairs in investigating the link between age and metallicity , we have carried out searches for these systems in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the lpine shara proper motion ( lspm , see @xcite for details ) northern hemisphere catalog and the wide commom proper motion pairs reported by @xcite . in the sdss data , @xcite have detected 60 subdwarfs from the analysis of nearly 8000 late type dwarfs .",
    "we compare the positions of these spectroscopically confirmed subdwarfs with the sdss wd catalog of @xcite to reveal wd - subdwarf pairs .",
    "the wd catalog has coordinates ( equinox 2000.0 , epoch approximately 2000.0 ) and many proper motions for the objects , but the subdwarf catalog only has coordinates ( equinox 2000.0 ) . in order to find potential close binaries in the two catalogs ,",
    "a coordinate comparison was carried out using a generous 5  search radius around each entry of the wd catalog .",
    "no subdwarfs were found in @xcite that were within 5  of any sdss wd catalog entries .",
    "@xcite have released the most comprehensive catalog of high proper motion stars in the northern sky , which contains nearly 62,000 stars with proper motions greater than 015 yr@xmath8 .",
    "populations of main sequence stars , subdwarfs , and white dwarfs found in the catalog can be separated effectively ( although not perfectly ) using proper motions and magnitudes to calculate each object s reduced proper motion , h , as introduced by @xcite and defined as follows ,    @xmath47    where @xmath1 is the proper motion in seconds of arc per year and @xmath48 is the apparent magnitude , @xmath49 .",
    "the simple assumption is that proper motion is correlated with parallax , so that samples without parallax measurements can be investigated .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have previously used this technique to separate subdwarfs from main sequence stars .",
    "our search of the lspm catalog utilizes the reduced proper motion diagram in figure  [ lspm.rpm ] , which plots @xmath50 vs.  @xmath32 color .",
    "because many faint objects in the lspm catalog lack @xmath49 band photometry , @xcite estimated the optical @xmath49 band magnitudes from photographic plate @xmath51 and @xmath52 magnitudes .",
    "the vast majority of lspm have reliable near infrared photometry from 2mass .",
    "for those that do not , @xcite estimate @xmath14 from plate @xmath53 magnitudes .",
    "we have defined rough boundaries , plotted in figure  [ lspm.rpm ] , to indicate the wd region .",
    "all possible wd candidates within this region are compared with all other stars in the lspm catalog to reveal companions , with the particular goal of finding subdwarf companions .",
    "the lspm catalog has a coordinate accuracy of about @xmath1390 mas and proper motion accuracy of @xmath1310 mas yr@xmath8 .",
    "two common proper motion binary searches were done , using the following criteria :    1 .",
    "separation of wd and candidate companion less than 1 , proper motion difference less than 01 yr@xmath8 , and position angle of the proper motion difference less than 5 degrees ; 2 .   separation of wd and candidate companion between 1  and 5 , proper motion difference less than 001 yr@xmath8 , and position angle of the proper motion difference less than 1 degree .",
    "the results from the first search method are plotted in figure  [ lspm.rpm ] .",
    "companions of the wd candidates are shown as filled circles .",
    "there are 171 total binary system candidates , 8 of which are not shown on this figure because they lack @xmath32 colors .",
    "of the 163 systems with colors , 108 companions are in the main sequence region , 48 companions are in the wd region ( probable double degenerate binaries ) , and only seven stars are in the subdwarf region .",
    "these seven systems are the wd - subdwarf systems of interest here , and are listed in table 1 .",
    "of these seven , four have estimated @xmath49 and/or @xmath14 magnitudes and are on the edges of the subdwarf region , whereas three have good photometry from 2mass .",
    "we will carry out spectroscopic follow up observations to determine their luminosity classes .",
    "the second search revealed 24 candidate common proper motion binaries .",
    "twenty of the companions are in the main sequence region , four are in the wd region , and none are in the subdwarf region .    the third database from @xcite table 1 has been searched for the sdm - wd binaries .",
    "although there are 1147 pairs of wide commom proper motion binaries , only 58 systems been classified as `` at least one component is a white dwarf '' by them based on the reduced proper motion diagram .",
    "one system 880 - 460/880 - 461 ( nltt catalogue identifiers ) is shown to be sdm - wd binary on the reduced proper motion diagram . however , after carefully checking the photographic plates having about 14 years time span , both stars do not appear to move at 0@xmath725 yr@xmath8 and both `` components '' do not have common proper motions as reported in the nltt catalogue .",
    "therefore , this system is not convincing and no sdm - wd has been found from table 1 in @xcite .",
    "we conclude that wd - subdwarf pairs are quite rare .",
    "the three searches revealed only seven candidate systems , and only three of those have reliable photometry .",
    "accurate @xmath49 and @xmath14 photometry for more of the stars in lspm might reveal additional candidate systems .",
    "the rarity of subdwarfs in the solar neighborhood increases our difficulty in understanding their physical parameters , including their sizes , masses , and even ages .",
    "the discovery of the two rare wd - subdwarf systems reported here provides a crucial step towards a better understanding of the star formation history of our galaxy because these systems allow us to link the ages of the wds to the metallicities of the subdwarfs .",
    "figure 3 indicates that the metallicities of both lhs 193a and lhs 300a are [ m / h ] @xmath13 @xmath40.5 ( details of the methodology are the subject of a future paper ) .",
    "unfortunately , these systems are rare , so it will take considerable effort to build up a statistical database .",
    "nevertheless , a careful reconnaissance may reveal enough systems to produce a map of age vs. metallicity that will provide valuable insight into the galaxy s past .",
    "the hr diagram and spectroscopic analysis both indicate that the red components in the wd - subdwarf systems are true subdwarfs . from our astrometry results of the subdwarf components ( @xcite )",
    ", we also know that the tangential velocities are indicative of an old population  147 km / sec for lhs 193a and 183 km / sec for lhs 300ab .",
    "comparison of our results to the kinematic study of low mass stars of @xcite ( shown in the inset of figure  [ hrdiag ] ) , both primaries appear to have halo - like kinematics .",
    "the wd _ total _ ages of 6 - 9 gyr derived here indicate that the systems are not members of the young disk or extremely old halo , but they are probably members of the old disk ( or young halo ) population .    to estimate the @xmath46 ages discussed above we calculated values of progenitor mass and main sequence lifetimes for two prescriptions of @xcite as well as the relation proposed by @xcite .",
    "when comparing the progenitor masses determined for each star we see that there is a considerable difference when adopting one or another prescription for the initial to final mass relation .",
    "however , the final ages obtained are within the approximate error of 1 gyr suggested by @xcite .",
    "this is a clear indication that although these prescriptions should be used with caution , reliable total age estimates are possible because the cooling time is the dominant factor .",
    "figure 6 shows the three systems studied here in the @xmath54 diagram , with a background of cooling curve isochrones ( solid lines ) and corresponding @xmath46 age curves ( dotted lines ) for the `` best guess model '' of @xcite . notice that lhs 300b is located at the convergence region of the @xmath46 age curves and therefore it could be even older than the 6 - 9 gyr estimate , given the uncertainty in its mass .",
    "uncertainties in wd cooling times and temperatures may cause the ages reported here to be in error .",
    "@xcite discuss in detail many current issues in wd cooling time calculations . of particular interest to our work is the variation of cooling curves due to different adopted abundances for wd cores .",
    "the authors point out that discrepancies as large as 3.6 gyr can occur for a given luminosity of @xmath55 by adopting either a pure o core or a pure c core .",
    "however , the cooling ages determined in this work are in the range of 17 gyr , where this discrepancy should still be within our method uncertainty of  1 gyr ( see figure 7 in @xcite ) . as an example of the kind of changes that may occur in wd models , dufour et al ( 2005 ) showed that the temperatures of dq wds may be significantly lower than previous values , when model atmospheres including metals and molecules are considered .",
    "this in turn has a direct implication on the masses determined for these objects .",
    "they find that the mean masses of the dq wds are reduced from 0.72 to 0.61 @xmath56 , in better agreement with the non - da wd mean mass .",
    "this effect may also be important for non - da wd stars in general , as in our case , indicating that the ages estimated here should be taken as an upper limit .",
    "the only other wd - subdwarf system with an estimated _ total _ age for the wd is lp164@xmath451/52 , for which @xcite identify the system as a halo candidate with an age estimate of 9.6 gyr ( silvestri , private communication ) .",
    "this age is based on an assumed wd mass of 0.61 @xmath3 , and an interpolation of the same model grids used here , although for the ( @xmath28 vs age ) and/or ( @xmath34 vs age ) diagrams .",
    "however , this procedure could lead to erroneous age estimates if the mass value is incorrect by even 0.1 @xmath3 , as can be seen , for example , in our figure 6 for a given temperature .",
    "ideally , a trigonometric parallax will be determined for lp164@xmath451/52 and the characterization of the system can be completed .",
    "in this work we present accurate @xmath30 and spectroscopy from 6000  to 9000  for two new wd - subdwarf systems , lhs 193ab and lhs 300ab .",
    "astrometry and photometry clearly identify each system to be comprised of a wd and a red subdwarf .",
    "the featureless spectra indicate that both wds are type dc . in combination with our astrometry , photometry , and spectroscopy",
    ", we use literature model grids for helium - rich atmospheres to determine the surface gravities , temperatures , masses , and cooling ages of the wds .    with the cooling ages and masses of the wds , we estimate progenitor masses and main sequence lifetimes for the objects , and add the cooling ages to derive @xmath46 ages of 6 - 9 gyr for both systems . to determine the progenitor masses , we use three different prescriptions to avoid biases toward any particular model , and confirm the approximate @xmath131 gyr uncertainty in the ages suggested by @xcite . although some work has been done on the subject of mapping the connection from progenitor mass to remnant mass @xcite there is still not a reasonable final solution to this question and the values presented here may change with different models .",
    "we do not consider this to be a significant problem because the cooling age comprises most of the @xmath46 age .",
    "these are the first two wd - subdwarf system for which precise photometry , spectroscopy , and most importantly , parallaxes , are available .",
    "this unique combination allows us to link the ages of the wds to the low metallicities of specific red subdwarfs for the first time .",
    "we find that these two systems are likely members of the thick disk population of the galaxy , which is supported by the systems large tangential velocities .",
    "even when errors are considered , the systems are not likely to be members of the halo because the @xmath46 ages are below the canonical age of 12 to 14 gyr usually adopted for halo type objects ( see @xcite and references therein for details ) .",
    "accurate radial velocity measurements , when combined with the accurate astrometry reported here , would also provide useful insights into the kinematic population of the two systems . nonetheless , we find the compelling result that there exist ancient stars in the solar neighborhood of low metallicity that are fossils of the early star formation epochs of our galaxy .",
