    "the roots of @xmath2 lie on the curve @xmath3 if @xmath7 and @xmath4 if @xmath8 .",
    "let s quickly review some definitions and properties of the bernoulli numbers and their polynomials .",
    "the bernoulli numbers are defined by a generating function : @xmath9 there is no simple way to generate the bernoulli numbers , they are defined as the coefficients of the taylor expansion of the function above .",
    "the bernoulli numbers are also coefficients of the bernoulli polynomials which are also defined by a generating function in two variables : @xmath10 one use of the bernoulli polynomials is to express sums of similar powers : @xmath11 in fact ocneanu s original question as posed in class was to consider the left side of ( 1 ) , consider it as a polynomial in a complex variable and plot its roots .",
    "this his question was about the sums of like power and not necessarily bernoulli polynomials .",
    "however , we simplify the problem silghly by not subtracting off terms .",
    "given a sequence of polynomials , how do we know the roots accumulate on any curve ?",
    "futhermore , how do we compute this curve ? in the october 2005 edition the american mathemaitcal monthly i saw this plot :    the paper , @xcite , was by stephen zemyan of pennsylvania state university , mont alto .",
    "he wrote on the roots of the truncated exponential series . if you cut the taylor series of @xmath12 after @xmath13 terms you get a polynomial @xmath14 as @xmath15 the roots go to @xmath16 since @xmath12 has no complex roots , but if you rescale by a factor of @xmath13 , the roots of @xmath17 approach the curve @xmath18 .",
    "this was proven by gabor szeg in 1928 appearing in his famous problem book @xcite and in a seperate paper @xcite .",
    "basically szeg s result has to do with the gamma function that @xmath19 however , this work seemed to come out of nowhere and i went in search of more systemattic approach to this problem .    around 1935 ,",
    "jean dieudonn proved the same result about the rescaled roots of the truncated exponential series .",
    "he shows that : @xmath20}{z^n } = \\frac{1}{1-z } \\left [ 1 + \\lambda_n(z)\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath21 uniformly on the @xmath22 .",
    "bounding away from @xmath23 is essential because of the pole in the asymptotics . in his paper dieudonn",
    "says that his solution is a technique which works for general classes of functions .",
    "having read dieudonn s proof , the author will try this technique on the bernoulli polynomials .    unlike the exponential problem proved by szeg and dieudonne ,",
    "the bernoulli polynomials are not the truncations of any particular infinite series .",
    "the coeffients seem to  jump \" around and diverge .",
    "there was no obvious way to get around this problem in 1987 , karl dilcher showed the following formulas using properties of the riemann zeta funtion :    as in @xcite , let @xmath24 be the truncated sine and cosine series , for @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26    on compact subsets of @xmath1 we get uniform convergence : @xmath27    this showed the bernoulli polynomials were intimately related to the basic trigonometric functions and gave a quantative error between the limits of the respective truncations .",
    "however , if we substitute @xmath28 as an argument instead of @xmath29 , we get uniform convergence on a small disc where @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "this means we can not show these functions are unformly close on the full disc @xmath32 on which the roots lie .",
    "however , we do get a compelling picture",
    "now we will show the real roots of @xmath2 are uniformly spaced on an interval @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "since karl dilcher related bernoulli polynomials to trigonometric series and exponential functions , fourier series may be the appropriate tool .",
    "let s recall a result of hurwitz :    the fourier series of the bernoulli polynomials are given by : @xmath34 notice this fourier series has period 1 so we use the fractional part sign @xmath35 .",
    "the coefficients can be found all at once using the generating function : @xmath36 for each individual @xmath37 we get a fourier series like the one above .    what are the asymptotics of this periodized version of the bernoulli polynomials ?",
    "the bernoulli polynomials @xmath38 converge uniformly to @xmath39 in the unit disc @xmath40 .",
    "consider the fourier series from the previous lemma : @xmath34 every term except @xmath41 goes to zero as @xmath42 goes to infinity .",
    "this gives us pointwise convergence .",
    "is this convergence uniform for @xmath43 ?",
    "yes @xmath44    now we have estimated the periodized version of the bernoulli polynomials @xmath45 but how do we estimate @xmath46 ?    as @xmath42 approaches infinity @xmath46 approaches @xmath47 this convergence is uniform in the unit interval @xmath48 $ ] for any @xmath49 .",
    "let s do one at a time : @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath51 for @xmath52 $ ] , does the riemann sum above convergence uniformly in @xmath40 to the following integral ?",
    "@xmath53 since @xmath54 is monotone in @xmath55 on @xmath56 $ ] , the difference between the upper and lower riemann sums is just the difference between the first term of the upper sum and the last term of the lower sum .",
    "the riemann sum above is the lower sum .",
    "the upper sum is defined between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "their difference is just @xmath59^{n-1 } < x^{n-1}$ ] .",
    "this means convergence will be uniform for @xmath60 $ ] for @xmath49 .",
    "how let s take another look at ( 3 ) : @xmath61 we need an estimate of stirling s formula with errors . by considering the integral @xmath62 it is possible using laplace s method to get stirling s esimate : @xmath63\\ ] ] thus @xmath64}{(2\\pi i ) ^n}\\sum_{k = -\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{e^{2\\pi",

    "this is basically the stategy we will use in passing to the complex roots .",
    "the previous section s result can be found in @xcite from 1999 . in this section , while the proof is new , the result was anticipated by karl dilcher .",
    "let s start writing the simple generating function relation @xmath67 and rewriting it in terms of bernoulli polynomials : @xmath68 let s define a functional : @xmath69 this functional is linear in generating functions @xmath70 or equivalently , sequences @xmath71 . in particular , we evaluate this functional for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "as @xmath42 approaches infinity , @xmath74 approaches @xmath75",
    "@xmath76    this cooresponds to a riemann integral : @xmath77 and since this function is monotone in @xmath55 we get the same error bound as before : @xmath78 as long as @xmath79 we get uniform convergence for @xmath49 .",
    "now let s give our final major estimates of the paper :    as @xmath42 approaches infinity @xmath80 approaches @xmath81^n}{(2\\pi i e)^n } \\left [ p_n(2 \\pi ny ) + p_n(-2\\pi n y )   \\right]\\ ] ]    now we transform @xmath82 .",
    "we already know its fourier series expansion for real arguments .",
    "let s use the convolution formula above to get add an imaginary value @xmath83 : @xmath84 therefore we get the following estimate for @xmath85 .",
    "we pull out the @xmath86 terms in the fourier series , which do not decay with @xmath87 . in the third line",
