    "almost 40 years ago , it was suggested that the centres of galaxies host supermassive black holes and , further , that accretion onto those black holes powers active galactic nuclei ( agn ; salpeter 1964 ; zeldovich 1964 ; lynden - bell 1969 ) .",
    "nowadays , the observational evidence in support of this picture is substantial .",
    "proper motion studies of the stars in the centralmost regions of the milky way provide compelling evidence for the presence of a supermassive black hole with a mass of about @xmath1 ( eckart & genzel 1997 ; ghez et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 , 2003 ; eckart et al . 2002 ; schdel et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the kinematics of rotating central gas disks in several nearby low - luminosity agn has also provided some of the most convincing evidence for supermassive black holes ( for example , m87 : ford et al .",
    "1994 , harms et al .",
    "1994 ; ngc  4258 : miyoshi et al . 1995 ; greenhill et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "finally , spectroscopic studies of stellar kinematics reveal that almost all galaxies studied to date do indeed possess a central supermassive black hole . the very strong correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion of a galaxy s bulge and the mass of the black hole it hosts ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) argues for an intimate link between supermassive black hole and galaxy formation , a result of fundamental importance .    with the existence of supermassive black holes established",
    ", it is clearly of interest to study them in detail . while of crucial importance for establishing the presence of supermassive black holes , all of the kinematic studies mentioned above probe conditions and physics at large distances from the black hole , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and where @xmath4 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "however , the energetically dominant region of an agn accretion flow is very close to the central black hole , @xmath5 , where general relativistic effects become strong .",
    "this is the region we must consider if we are to truly understand these systems . luckily , nature has provided us with an extremely useful probe of this region .",
    "x - ray irradiation of relatively cold material in the vicinity of the black hole can imprint characteristic features into the x - ray spectra of black hole systems , most notably the k@xmath6 fluorescent line of iron .",
    "detailed x - ray spectroscopy of these features can be used to study doppler and gravitational redshifts , thereby providing key information on the location and kinematics of the cold material .",
    "this is a powerful tool that allows us to probe within a few gravitational radii , or less , of the event horizon .",

    "it was the first object for which observations by the _",
    "advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) _ clearly revealed an iron emission line with a profile sculpted by strong relativistic effects ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; fabian et al .",
    "1995 ) . since then",
    ", studies of the iron line in this object have given us a window into some of the most exotic black hole physics observed to date . by identifying and then examining the so - called `` deep minimum '' state of this object , iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) used the iron line profile as measured by _",
    "asca _ to demonstrate the need for iron fluorescence from within @xmath8 , the radius of marginal stability around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this suggested that the central black hole was rapidly rotating ( in order that the radius of marginal stability lie at @xmath9 ; iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 , dabrowski et al .",
    "1997 ) , although the possibility of fluorescence from within @xmath10 prevented these arguments from being made rigorous ( reynolds & begelman 1997 ) .",
    "more recently , _",
    "xmm - newton _ observations have provided strong support for the hypothesis of a rapidly rotating black hole .",
    "the first _ xmm - newton _ observation of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 caught the object in a prolonged deep minimum state , allowing a high signal - to - noise spectrum to be obtained .",
    "the iron line was found to be extremely broadened and redshifted ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ; hereafter paper i ) , in agreement with the previous results of iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . using the scenario of reynolds & begelman ( 1997 )",
    ", even these new data could be ( formally ) described with emission around a non - rotating black hole .",
    "however , one would need essentially _ all _ of the emission to originate inside of @xmath11 , i.e. half of the radius of marginal stability .",
    "this is an unreasonable emission pattern in any current accretion model .",
    "thus , while uncertainties within the radius of marginal stability still hamper attempts to make these arguments absolutely rigorous , the data presented in paper i make a compelling case that the supermassive black hole in mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 is rapidly rotating .",
    "the principal result of paper i was the extreme central concentration of the iron line emission required to describe the observed breadth and redshift of the line profile . even within the context of a rapidly - rotating kerr black hole ( with dimensionless spin parameter @xmath12 ) , a phenomenological model in which the line emissivity varied as a power - law in radius ( @xmath13 ) required an inner emitting radius of @xmath14 and an emissivity index of @xmath15 .",
    "assuming that the iron line emissivity tracks ( even approximately ) the underlying dissipation in the disk , this is in serious conflict with standard radiatively - efficient accretion disk models .",
    "in paper i , we suggested that the central disk is being torqued by magnetic interaction with either the plunging region ( gammie 1999 ; krolik 1999 ; agol & krolik 2000 ) or the rotating event horizon ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; li 2002 ) . in both cases",
    ", the magnetic torque does work on the central accretion disk thereby producing a very centrally concentrated energy source .    in this paper",
    ", we further explore the _ xmm - newton_/epic data set first presented in paper i. after describing our updated data reduction and calibration in section  2 , we present two distinct but related investigations .",
    "firstly , in section  3 , we re - analyze the time - averaged x - ray reflection features investigated in paper i. we show that the principal conclusions of paper i , especially the need for a very high emissivity index , are robust to the application of a self - consistent ionized reflection model as well as the continuum curvature introduced by the inclusion of a physical thermal comptonisation model or a complex absorber . by explicitly fitting the torqued disk model of agol & krolik ( 2000 ) ,",
    "we strengthen the hypothesis that this accretion disk is extracting the black hole s spin energy . in section  4",
    ", we proceed to examine variability of the iron line features .",
    "our results for the deep minimum state are put into a wider context , and implications for models of this source are discussed , in section  5 .    throughout this paper",
    ", we shall assume a hubble constant of @xmath16 ( from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ; spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the corresponding distance to mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 is @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ; reynolds et al .",
    "1997 ) , assuming negligible motion of this galaxy relative to the hubble flow .",
    "all uncertainties are quoted at the 90% level for one significant parameter ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "our observation covered most of _ xmm - newton _ s orbit 108 , on 2000 june 11/12 , and was quasi - simultaneous with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) . here",
    ", we mainly report on data from the european photon imaging pn - camera onboard _ xmm - newton _",
    "( epic , strder et al . , 2001 ,",
    "turner et al . , 2001 ) , which was operated in its small window mode and the medium thick filter . the epic mos-1 and mos-2 cameras were operated in the timing mode and the full - frame mode , respectively . due to remaining calibration uncertainties of these cameras ,",
    "we concentrate on the results from the epic - pn in this paper , and use the mos-2 data only to check the instrument independency of our results . the data analysis was performed with version 5.3 of the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas ) and with version 11.2.0 of xspec ( arnaud , 1996 ) .    the source spectra and lightcurves were obtained from a circle with @xmath20 radius centered on the source .",
    "we extracted spectra from single and double events separately , i.e. , from events where all electrons produced by an x - ray photon are detected in a single epic - pn pixel or in two adjacent epic - pn pixels , respectively .",
    "as the energy - dependent distribution differs for single and for double events , modeling the data from both types of events separately allows us to check for the possible presence of pile - up in our data .",
    "background data were extracted from a circle of the same area as the source data , but on a different position of the epic - pn to avoid the possible contamination of the background spectrum by out of time events , i.e. , by photons registered during the read - out cycle of the epic pn . since the background increases during the final part of the observation as _ xmm - newton _ approaches the earth s radiation belts , the last 20ksec of our observation are unusable .",
    "furthermore , the telemetry gap due to the incomplete ground station coverage of _ xmm - newton _ s orbit during the early phase of the mission is still present in our data ( this situation has changed since then ) .",
    "the total epic - pn exposure time after the background screening is 112ksec ( with a `` live - time '' of 65ksec ) .",
    "the blue line in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the 210kev epic - pn lightcurve of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 for our observation .",
    "since the source is strongly variable , in this paper we analyze data from both the overall observation , and from 10ksec long data segments .",
    "as we mentioned above , observations with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) were performed quasi - simultaneously with _",
    "xmm - newton_. starting before _",
    "xmm - newton _ , the rxte observations cover most of the _ xmm - newton _ observation , albeit with a much worse sampling due to the low earth orbit of the satellite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] , red line ) .",
    "we extracted the rxte data following standard procedures ( employing lheasoft 5.2 ) , using the newest instrument calibrations .",
    "to avoid times of high background count rates , only data taken more than 10minutes after passages through the south atlantic anomaly were considered , with the additional constraint that the `` electron ratio '' , a measure for the particle background in the pca , was less than 0.1 . as mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15",
    "is a rather faint source for the nonimaging instruments on rxte , we concentrate on the data from rxte s low energy instrument , the proportional counter array ( pca ) , only . due to calibration uncertainties , only pca data in the energy range from 3kev to 15kev were used .",
    "in this section , we present a detailed re - analysis of the time - averaged epic - pn spectrum first presented in paper i. the purpose of this re - analysis is two - fold .",
    "firstly , we wish to test the robustness of the results from paper i to the application of more realistic models .",
    "we will demonstrate that one still requires extreme broadening / redshifting of the x - ray reflection features , even when one uses self - consistent ionized reflection models ( that include compton broadening of the iron line ) , complex absorption , and a curved continuum derived from thermal comptonisation .",
    "with that fact established , the second purpose of this section is to apply physically motivated relativistic smearing laws to these data , allowing us to test directly particular accretion disk models .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the above discussion , we have examined these data with a variety of spectral models .",
    "we have found that the need for extreme relativistic effects is robust to different treatments of the soft x - ray complexity , complex absorption , and the use of a comptonisation model instead of a simple power - law to describe the primary x - ray continuum .    until now",
    ", we have employed a phenomenological model for the radial dependence of the disk emissivity , assuming that it can be described by a power - law form @xmath13 truncated by inner and outer radii @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "while this is an extremely useful parameterization , it does not correspond to any particular physical disk model .",
    "given the quality of these data , we can go beyond these simple power - law emissivity profiles and attempt to constrain physical relativistic smearing models .",
    "firstly , we shall review some of the pertinent theory related to the geometrically - thin accretion disks of the type thought to be operating in seyfert nuclei such as mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "the standard thin disk model of black hole accretion was developed in a newtonian setting by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , and extended into a fully relativistic theory by novikov & thorne ( 1974 ) and page & thorne ( 1974 ; hereafter pt ) . in this model , the accretion disk",
    "is assumed to be geometrically - thin , radiatively - efficient , and in a steady - state .",
    "furthermore , it is postulated that the disk experiences zero torque at the radius of marginal stability . with these assumptions",
    ", one can compute the dissipation rate , and hence total radiative flux as a function of radius and black hole spin : @xmath23 where we have defined the function @xmath24 @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with , @xmath26 this dissipation profile is zero at @xmath10 due to the zero - torque assumption , increases to a broad peak at @xmath27 , and then declines as @xmath28 at large radii ( thick line in fig .  [ fig : disk_models ] ) .",
    "it has been realized in recent years that the assumption of zero - torque at the radius of marginal stability may be invalidated by magnetic connections between the keplerian portion of the accretion disk and either the plunging region ( i.e. , the region @xmath29 ) or the rotating event horizon itself ( krolik 1999 ; gammie 1999 ; li 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "the formal generalization of the pt disk models including a ( arbitrary ) torque at @xmath10 is given by agol & krolik ( 2000 ) , who parameterized the extra torque via the corresponding enhancement in the radiative efficiency of the disk , @xmath30 . the work done by the torque on the disk produces a new component to the disk dissipation that is very centrally concentrated , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath30 is the additional disk efficiency induced by the torque ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : disk_models ] ) .",
    "when this component is substantial , the overall dissipation profile is so concentrated that one can no longer ignore ( even at a crude level ) the effects of returning radiation ( cunningham 1975 ) . in the limiting case of an infinite - efficiency disk ( i.e. , a disk that derives its whole luminosity from work done by the central torque ) around a near - extremal kerr black hole , as much as half of the radiation emitted from the disk can return to the disk via the action of strong light bending .",
    "agol & krolik ( 2000 ) showed that the effect of returning radiation is to produce an extra source of disk illumination described by the expression , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is well described by the fitting formula given by agol & krolik ( 2000 ) .",
    "thus , in this `` generalized standard model '' of thin - disk accretion onto black holes , the energy that is dissipated per unit proper time and per unit proper surface area is @xmath35 suppose that a fraction @xmath36 of this energy is transported into a disk corona and hence radiated in the hard x - ray continuum ( rather than as soft thermal emission from the optically - thick part of the accretion disk ) . if the corona is geometrically - thin then , with the exception of returning radiation , we need not consider light bending effects when deducing the x - ray flux that irradiates the optically - thick accretion disk ( and hence gives rise to the observed reflection spectrum ) . assuming that the corona is geometrically - thin and emits isotropically , the optically - thick disk will be irradiated by x - rays with an intensity , @xmath37+\\bar{f}d_{\\rm ret}(r;a),\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is an appropriate averaging of @xmath36 over the inner radii of the disk that contributes to the returning radiation . given a functional form for @xmath36",
    ", this irradiation profile can be used to construct the appropriately weighted relativistic smearing kernel that can then be convolved with the rest - frame reflection spectrum , thereby producing a full spectral model of smeared reflection from the disk .",
    "we now compare the epic pn data for mcg6 - 30 - 15 with spectral models constructed from this generalized standard model of thin - disk accretion .",
    "however , we must first choose a functional form for @xmath36 , the fraction of the dissipated energy released in the irradiating x - ray continuum . here",
    ", we choose the function form : @xmath39 where @xmath22 can be considered as a `` coronal truncation radius '' .",
    "we also examine the situation in which @xmath36 is a powerlaw in radius ( see below ) .    using this form for @xmath36 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : dissipation_law ] , we construct new relativistic smearing functions and hence a spectral model that can be compared with the data .",
    "this model ( and indeed all models presented in the rest of this paper ) assume a near - extremal kerr black hole ( with spin @xmath12 ) and employ the laor ( 1991 ) relativistic transfer function .",
    "we shall refer to the most general form of our model , where @xmath30 and @xmath22 are free parameters , as ttorqued ( shorthand for truncated - torqued disk ) .",
    "the results of fitting model ttorqued to the epic pn data are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : phys_fits]a , fig .",
    "[ fig : rout_deta_cont ] and table  [ tab : fits3 ] .",
    "examination of the confidence contours in the @xmath40-plane shows that , within the context of this model , the data require the disk to be both torqued ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) and possess a finite coronal truncation radius at better than the 95% confidence level for two interesting parameters .",
    "in fact , the data require a very strongly torqued disk , with @xmath42 ( i.e. , 2200% ) at the 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter . in the language of agol & krolik ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the data argue for an `` infinite - efficiency disk '' , in which the dominant energy source is the black hole spin as opposed to gravitational potential energy of the accretion flow .",
    "we explore the constraints imposed by these data further by restricting parameters of the ttorqued model and examining the effect on the goodness - of - fit .",
    "firstly , we consider the case in which the disk is subject to a torque at @xmath10 but the corona is not truncated ( i.e. , @xmath43 ; we refer to this as the torqued model ) . from table  [",
    "tab : fits3 ] , it can be seen that the goodness - of - fit parameter increases slightly ( @xmath44 for one less degree of freedom in both the 210kev and 0.510kev fits ) .",
    "an application of the f - test suggests that this is a significantly worse description of these data at the 99.2% level",
    ". however , protassov et al . (",
    "2002 ) have pointed out that it is formally incorrect to use the f - test in this case ; the torqued model lies on one boundary of the parameter space describing ttorqued ( the @xmath45 boundary ) , and this fact can skew the probability distribution of the goodness of fit parameter . due to this caveat ,",
    "we consider that the evidence for coronal truncation is marginal .",
    "secondly , we assess the evidence for the presence of the inner torque at @xmath10 .",
    "if we impose the restriction that @xmath46 , we have an irradiation profile that follows a pt dissipation profile , albeit with an outer truncation radius .",
    "we refer to this model as tptdisk .",
    "as reported in table  [ tab : fits3 ] ( also see fig .  [",
    "fig : phys_fits]b ) , the goodness - of - fit parameter increases by @xmath47 upon the removal of this one degree of freedom from the models .",
    "the f - test implies that this is a significantly worse description of the data at the 99.97% level . note that we do _ not _ impose the restriction that @xmath41 in our ttorqued fits and , hence , the restricted model tptdisk does _ not _ lie on the boundary of the parameter space describing ttorqued .",
    "thus , the restriction on the application of the f - test raised by protassov et al . ( 2002 ) does not apply here and we have no reason to distrust the f - test results .",
    "hence , these data provide strong evidence for the presence of an inner disk torque .",
    "we note that the best - fitting parameters of tptdisk also might be inconsistent with the overall spectral energy distribution of mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "the coronal truncation radius in these fits is constrained to be @xmath48 , the same as the half - light radius of the accretion disk ( @xmath49 ; agol & krolik 2000 ) . since 3050% of the total radiative luminosity of this agn is observed to emerge in the x - ray band ( reynolds et al .",
    "1997 ) , this result would imply an extremely high value of @xmath36 ( i.e. , almost unity ) in the inner disk .",
    "we can also use this chain of reasoning to eliminate more extreme forms for the coronal dissipation fraction @xmath36 . in detail , we refit the tptdisk model allowing @xmath36 to have a power - law form , @xmath50 . the goodness of fit is close to that for the best - fit ttorqued model .",
    "however , these fits require @xmath51 at the 90% confidence level . noting the trivial fact that @xmath36 can not exceed unity , integration of the coronal dissipation across the disk implies that at most 3% of the dissipated energy can be released in the x - ray corona . again",
    ", this violates the constraints on the total energetics of this source by a factor of 5 , even once we include the fact that the instantaneous x - ray flux drops by a factor of 2 when the source enters the deep minimum state .    finally , we examine the doubly restricted model ptdisk in which @xmath46 and @xmath43 . from table  [",
    "tab : fits3 ] it can be seen that this is a much worse fit to the data , with @xmath52 ( upon the restriction of two model parameters ) compared with the most general ttorqued model .",
    "indeed , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phys_fits]c that the line profile visibly misses the data in the sense that it is insufficiently redshifted .",
    "furthermore , the ptdisk model constrains the inclination to be less than @xmath53 ( @xmath54 if only the 210kev data are considered ) .",
    "if we force the inclination to be @xmath55 ( the value deduced from the long asca observation of the `` normal '' state of this object by tanaka et al . [ 1995 ] ) , the goodness of fit is _ further _ decreased by @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the 210kev and 0.510kev fits , respectively . in this case , the systematic residuals in the fit are further exaggerated ( fig .  [",
    "fig : phys_fits]d ) .    in summary , we construct relativistic smearing functions weighted by physically - motivated irradiation profiles whose parameters include the extra radiative efficiency @xmath30 due to the torque that is applied to the @xmath10 ( via mhd processes within the plunging region ) and a coronal truncation radius @xmath22 .",
    "we have found strong evidence that the disk is strongly torqued and , at this instant in time , may well be radiating primarily via the work done by this torque ( a so - called infinite - efficiency disk ) .",
    "there is weaker evidence for a radial dependence of @xmath36 which we model as a truncation of the corona at @xmath58 .",
    "with data of this quality , it is obviously interesting to search for spectral variability on the shortest timescales possible .",
    "experimentation shows that an adequate spectrum requires an exposure of 10ksec of data . in this section",
    ", we analyze spectral variability across eleven uniformly spaced 10ksec segments of our observation .",
    "the median `` live = time '' for each of these segments is about 7ksec .    of particular interest , of course , is any variability of the iron line profile .",
    "we begin our investigation of iron line variability by examining `` difference spectra '' , following the work of fabian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) . in detail , we isolate and examine the variable part of the x - ray spectrum by subtracting the lowest flux spectrum from the other spectra .",
    "since we are primarily interested in iron line variability , we restrict our attention to the 210kev region of the epic - pn spectrum . figure  [ fig : diff_spec ] shows two representative difference spectra ( for the 8090ksec and 100110ksec segments ) , using the 1020ksec segment of data as our representative lowest - state spectrum ; the broad spectral feature that we interpret as reflection from a relativistic disk can be seen in both of these difference spectra .",
    "in fact , 8 of the 10 difference spectra show evidence for the very broad disk feature , with the remaining two spectra being too noisy to draw any conclusions .",
    "furthermore , the narrow iron line does not appear in the difference spectra .",
    "in other words , the narrow iron line has a constant absolute flux , as expected if it originates from distant material .",
    "although they are rather noisy , the difference spectra suggest that ( apart from the narrow iron line ) the 210kev epic - pn spectrum maintains the same overall shape during large changes in source flux once small variations in the underlying power - law index have been taken into account .",
    "in other words , the difference spectra imply that the broadened reflection features maintain a constant equivalent width relative to the underlying continuum , as opposed to a constant absolute intensity .",
    "to investigate this further , we fit each spectrum with a power - law modified by galactic absorption plus a simple broad iron line described by the laor model in xspec .",
    "these fits are much simpler than those discussed in section  [ sec : time_ave ] since we do not include the reflected x - ray continuum .",
    "we fix all parameters of the laor component apart from its intensity at the values derived by fitting this model to the time - averaged spectrum ; @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "of course , the spectral feature of interest is a combination of both a broad iron line and the rather complex ionized reflection continuum  however , the simple broad line model allows us to measure a robust intensity for this feature as a whole . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : laor_flux ] , there is indeed a correlation between the 210kev continuum flux and the intensity of the broad disk feature such as to keep an approximately constant equivalent width .",
    "both the difference spectra and the direct spectral fitting shows that the equivalent width , not the absolute intensity , of the broad disk feature remains approximately constant throughout this observation .",
    "this is the behaviour expected within the disk reflection paradigm , but is at odds with the findings of previous investigations .",
    "we discuss this discrepancy and its possible resolution in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "it is also interesting to search for stochastic changes in the iron line profiles that are uncorrelated with the overall source flux . in fig .",
    "[ fig : line_ratios ] we show both the instantaneous 210kev spectrum and the time - averaged 210kev spectrum , ratioed against a simple power - law modified by galactic absorption . while there are hints of numerous features popping in and out of the line profile ( especially at @xmath63 ) , they are not statistically significant at the 90 per cent level and hence will not be discussed further .",
    "in fact , we find no gross changes in the velocity profile of the x - ray reflection features .",
    "the study described in sections  3 and 4 represents the most detailed study of the deep minimum state of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 to date .",
    "we have come to two important conclusions",
    "we have demonstrated the robustness of the extremely broadened disk reflection features reported in paper i. we employ the generalized thin disk model of agol & krolik ( 2000 ) , which includes a torque applied at the radius of marginal stability @xmath10 , and find that this inner torque is dominating the energetics of the system . in other words , the deep minimum disk is shining via the extraction of spin - energy from the central black hole and not through accretion .",
    "2 .   examination of both the difference spectra and direct spectral fits to the 10ksec segments of data shows that the intensity of the broad disk feature is consistent with being proportional to the 210kev flux . in other words ,",
    "the equivalent width of the disk feature is roughly constant as the source undergoes its large amplitude variability .",
    "this is expected from the simplest x - ray reflection model .",
    "it is important to compare and contrast these results with studies of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 in its normal state . in their paper",
    "that originally identified the deep minimum state , iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) used _ asca _ to show that the iron line profile was substantially broader in the deep minimum than at other times . more recently , fabian et al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter f02 ) examined an independent and long ( 350ksec ) _ xmm - newton _ observation of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 which mostly caught it in its normal flux state . in agreement with the expectation from iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , f02 found the iron line profile to be generally narrower than in the deep minimum state of paper i , although they clearly noted an extreme red - tail extending down to @xmath64kev . fitting",
    "the iron line with a near - extreme kerr black hole model ( @xmath12 ) using a broken - powerlaw emissivity profile indicated a rather flat emissivity profile ( @xmath65 ) for @xmath66 , breaking to a steep profile ( @xmath67 ) within this radius .",
    "thus , the principal difference in the shape of the emissivity profile between the deep minimum and normal states of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 appears to lie beyond some radius @xmath68 .",
    "while it is beyond the scope of this paper to fit our physical accretion disk models to the long _ xmm - newton _ data set , it is clear that a torque - dominated disk around a rapidly spinning black hole can not reproduce the normal state emissivity profile .",
    "there are also interesting differences in the spectral variability properties of the two states .",
    "careful analysis of the _",
    "rxte_-pca data for mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 during the normal state clearly showed that the iron line flux underwent significant variations but was not correlated with the continuum flux ( lee et al .",
    "2000 ; reynolds 2000 ; vaughan & edelson 2001 ) .",
    "this was confirmed in a rather direct manner by shih , iwasawa & fabian ( 2002 ) who used the 910ksec asca observation of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 to show that neither the intensity nor profile of the iron line were functions of the continuum flux",
    ". finally , fabian et al . ( 2002 ) and fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) examined the long ( 350ksec ) _ xmm - newton_/epic data of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 in its normal state and found that the hard - band difference spectra were all well described by power - law forms . using this fact , these authors decompose the epic - pn spectrum into an almost constant reflection dominated component and variable power - law component .",
    "this is clearly different to the behaviour that we find during the deep minimum state .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of these results for theoretical models of the central engine . in this discussion",
    ", we shall assume that the hard - band x - ray spectral features arise from x - ray illumination of a flat accretion disk orbiting a rapidly - rotating black hole in the prograde sense in the @xmath69 plane .",
    "we shall also assume that the steep emissivity profile of the inner disk is due to a violation of the standard zero - torque boundary condition at @xmath10 .",
    "we must note that the physics of the inner disk boundary is still very uncertain and the subject of current work and debate .",
    "the motivation behind the torqued model of section  [ sec : physical_disk_models ] was the presence of a magnetic connection between the inner disk and either the plunging region ( agol & krolik 2000 ) or the rotating ( stretched ) event horizon itself ( li 2002 ) .",
    "however , all aspects of this scenario have been challenged and debated .",
    "li ( 2003 ) analyzed the structure of the magnetic field within the plunging region and argued that the magnetic connection is too weak for the plunging region to influence the rest of the disk .",
    "however , these arguments are tempered by the fact that it seems to be rather easy to torque the disk with the plunging regions in simulated accretion disks ( e.g. , hawley & krolik 2001 ; reynolds & armitage 2002 ) . on a different note ,",
    "merloni & fabian ( 2003 ) have used the merloni ( 2003 ) model for the energization of the disk corona to argue that the inner corona is strongly suppressed by disk torquing . in other words , while the dissipation profile in a torqued disk can be very centrally concentrated , it might be hard to translate this into a centrally concentrated x - ray emission pattern . instead , they suggest that magnetic connections with the plunging region or rotating black hole energize the corona directly . a possible problem with this scenario is the requirement that the corona can transport the angular momentum released by the plunging region or black hole . finally ,",
    "williams ( 2003 ) has challenged the notion that magnetic fields are relevant for energizing the innermost disk .",
    "she shows that penrose scattering processes ( penrose 1969 ; williams 1995 ) can lead to a non - magnetic spin energy extraction mechanism .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this ( observational ) paper to address these physical processes in any detail . for",
    "now , we loosely refer to all of the above models and variants as `` torqued disk models '' , and assume that some form of interaction with the plunging region or ergosphere of the black hole is energizing the inner disk / corona and producing the steep emissivity profile seen in the observations .",
    "we can organize possible scenarios for deep minimum state transitions by considering the three components of the x - ray continuum that might be relevant to inner disk x - ray reflection ; ( 1 ) the normal accretion - powered x - ray emission from the corona of the accretion disk , ( 2 ) the torque - powered x - ray emission from the corona of the inner accretion disk , and ( 3 ) x - ray emission from a high latitude source ( maybe the base of a blandford - znajek powered jet ) near the black hole spin - axis ( we shall refer to this as the jet - component , although this emitting material may not necessarily be moving rapidly ) .",
    "we can then elucidate three scenarios for normal / deep - minimum state changes in mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 by considering the dominance of these three x - ray continuum components .    1 .",
    "_ constant - torque , variable - accretion case : _ suppose that the inner disk torque is long - lived and changes in inner disk accretion rate drive the observed changes . in particular , the deep minimum state would correspond to a temporary but dramatic decline in the accretion rate through the inner disk .",
    "this naturally explains the drop in continuum flux during deep minima as well as the broadening of the disk reflection features . on the other hand , this scenario does not straightforwardly explain why the strength of the x - ray reflection features appears to saturate in the normal state ( i.e.  maintain a constant flux rather than equivalent width ) . as discussed by reynolds ( 2000 ) and lee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , flux - correlated ionization changes in the disk surface might be responsible for this effect .",
    "a potentially more problematic issue for this scenario is the rate at which mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 can transit into a deep minimum state .",
    "one naively expects the accretion rate to change on the viscous timescale @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the radius of the disk , @xmath72 is its thickness , @xmath73 is the dynamical timescale and @xmath74 ( with @xmath75 ) is the usual dimensionless angular momentum transport parameter of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 )",
    ". if the mass of the black hole is @xmath76 ( with @xmath7710 ; reynolds 2000 ) we can deduce @xmath78 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath79ksec . although the actual time required to transit to the deep minimum state is poorly characterized , the _ asca _ study of iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggest that it is rather more rapid ( @xmath80ksec ) .",
    "thus , this model has may have problems reproducing the rapid transition .",
    "more detailed modelling , which is beyond the scope of this paper , is required to assess whether changes in accretion rate can really occur on such rapid timescales .",
    "sporadic - torque , constant - accretion case : _ motivated by the timescales noted above , we consider a model in which the accretion rate in the inner disk is constant , but the torque exerted on the inner boundary by the plunging region or the spinning black hole is sporadic on a short timescale . in this case , the deep minimum state corresponds to rather rare intervals ( duty cycle of @xmath81 ) in which the torque is `` engaged '' and strongly energizing the inner disk ( the fact that f02 also observe a steep emissivity profile in the very innermost disk suggests that the torque is engaged , albeit more weakly , even in the normal state ) .",
    "this model successfully explains the changes in the line profile and ( by construction through the assumed time - dependence of the torque ) the rapid transition timescale .",
    "as before , flux - correlated ionization changes would have to be invoked to explain the saturation of the reflection features seen in the normal state .",
    "however , all other things being equal , the torqued disk would be expected to be more luminous than the untorqued disk due to the work done by the torque .",
    "this is in contrast with the observed continuum drop when the source enters the deep minimum state .",
    "however , more theoretical work on the physics of sporadically - torqued accretion disks is required to assess the true time - dependence of the luminosity .",
    "_ time variable height of a jet x - ray source : _ as discussed by fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) , an interesting possibility is that a classical accretion powered disk corona is ( even if it exists ) unimportant for producing the x - ray reflection features .",
    "following the work of martocchia & matt ( 1996 ) and martocchia , matt & karas ( 2002 ) , fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) suggest that the x - ray source is located close to the spin - axis of the black hole and at some height from the accretion disk . if one further supposes that the long term ( @xmath82hz ) variability of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 is driven by changes in the height and not intrinsic luminosity of this source , general relativistic effects ( predominantly gravitational lightbending ) can reproduce the observed relation of continuum and x - ray reflection intensities .",
    "we can extend the fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) scenario into the deep minimum state in two ways .",
    "firstly , there might be a separate x - ray component due to the inner disk torque ( which would be emitted in a disk corona ) that is responsible for the extreme red wing seen at all times in this source .",
    "the deep minimum state then corresponds to times when the jet source fades to low levels .",
    "secondly , it is possible that there is only one x - ray emitting component . in the normal state",
    ", this is the jet component as discussed by martocchia & matt ( 1996 ) and fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) .",
    "the deep minimum state could correspond to times when the height of the jet component goes to zero in a continuous manner , i.e. , the jet component touches - down on the disk and transits over to become a viscously mediated torque - component .",
    "this latter event might accompany a change in the structure of the black hole magnetosphere .",
    "the key to distinguishing between these models is application of physical disk models similar to those described in this paper to all available high - quality data of mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 and similar sources . this will allow us to determine observationally whether the torqued component varies dramatically when the source enters into a deep minimum state .",
    "we also need more realistic spectral models so that the physics of the accretion disk can be probed with confidence .",
    "obvious improvements are to develop models in which the black hole spin is a free parameter of the fit ( since we have no right to believe that all real black holes have dimensionless spin parameters of @xmath12 ) which also take into account that the inner edge of the fluorescing part of an accretion disk is not sharp ( krolik & hawley 2002 ) .",
    "mhd simulations will be invaluable for guiding development of such models",
    ".    it might be difficult to disentangle the possible role of an on - axis jet using current data alone .",
    "observationally decomposing the x - ray continuum into its coronal and jet components may have to await the next generation of large - area observatories ( principally constellation - x and xeus ) which will allow one to assess the time delay between rapid x - ray variability and responses in the x - ray reflection spectrum .",
    "a measurement of this reverberation timescale would place strong constraints on the location of the x - ray source .",
    "we note that an x - ray source close to the spin axis of the black hole is the most favourable geometry for probing very strong relativistic effects ( including a robust measure of the black hole s spin parameter ) through x - ray iron line reverberation ( stella 1990 ; matt & perola 1992 ; campana & stellar 1993 , 1995 ; reynolds et al . 1999 ; young & reynolds 2000 ) .",
    "we thank andy fabian , david garofalo , julian krolik , cole miller , and andy young for insightful and stimulating discussions throughout the course of this work .",
    "we also thanks the anonymous referee for their thoughtful comments which lead to a dramatic improvement in the presentation of section  3.4 .",
