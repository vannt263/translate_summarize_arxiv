    "<S> capillary interactions can be used to direct assembly of particles adsorbed at fluid - fluid interfaces . precisely controlling the magnitude and direction of capillary interactions to assemble particles into favoured structures for materials science purposes is desirable but challenging . in this paper , we investigate capillary interactions between magnetic janus particles adsorbed at fluid - fluid interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a pair - interaction model that predicts that these particles should arrange into a side  side configuration , and carry out simulations that confirm the predictions of our model . finally , we investigate the monolayer structures that form when many magnetic janus particles adsorb at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the particles arrange into long , straight chains exhibiting little curvature , in contrast with capillary interactions between ellipsoidal particles . </S>",
