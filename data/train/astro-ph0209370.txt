    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are valuable tools for understanding the composition of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , recent star formation , and supernovae ( sne ) themselves .",
    "the structure of snrs and their interactions with the surrounding medium give us insight into their origin and effects on their environment .",
    "the second brightest x - ray snr in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , n63a , provides us with an excellent laboratory for studying such structures and interactions .",
    "this remnant is embedded in a larger h ii region , n63 , and appears to be located within the ob association ngc 2030 @xcite .",
    "n63a is believed to be the product of the explosion of a massive star in a dense and complex environment @xcite and is the first confirmed snr in an h ii region @xcite .",
    "the x - ray size of the snr ( @xmath4 or 8.2 pc radius for an lmc distance of 50 kpc ) is about three times the size of the optical remnant , which appears as a three - lobed structure @xcite .",
    "two lobes are shock - heated , while the third ( southwestern ) is a photoionized h ii region @xcite .",
    "the shock - heating is a result of interactions with the ism , rather than with sn ejecta , based on the derived abundances @xcite .",
    "similarly , the x - ray emission from n63a is also consistent with swept - up ism ( hughes et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the radio",
    ", the remnant appears as a thick shell , with the brightest emission corresponding to the two shock - heated eastern lobes of optical emission @xcite .",
    "n63a was shown by @xcite to be a significant iras source , with @xmath5 . however , the columbia co survey of the lmc revealed no significant molecular gas associated with the snr @xcite and no co emission was detected in a higher angular resolution pointed observation by sest @xcite .",
    "hughes et al .  ( 1998 ) estimate the age of n63a to be in the range 2000 - 5000 yr .",
    "we targeted n63a with  to study the interaction of the snr with the ism , to find evidence for sn ejecta , and to search for a compact remnant and its associated pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) . here",
    "we report on the most prominent new features of the remnant derived from the  imaging and spectral data .",
    "n63a was observed for 45.7 ks on 2000 october 16 on the back - side  illuminated chip ( s3 ) of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) ( obs i d 777 ) .",
    "the remnant was offset slightly from the aimpoint to ensure that it fell entirely on one node of the chip . in order to reduce as much of the pixel - to - pixel variation in the data as possible , we employed the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) corrector code @xcite to correct for spatial gain variations .",
    "we used standard software tools to filter for grade ( retaining grades 02346 only ) , bad pixels , and times of high or flaring background .",
    "there were count rate flares up to 26 s@xmath3 summed over the entire s3 chip ( excluding the source ) , compared to a rate of 24 s@xmath3 for n63a .",
    "nevertheless the source extent is small enough that even a moderate background count rate restriction ( @xmath614 s@xmath3 ) was found to be acceptable for our studies .",
    "after all filtering , the net exposure time was 41.4 ks .",
    "all spectral analyses utilized the pi column of the final _ chandra _ events file .    in figure",
    "1a we present a three - color  x - ray image of n63a .",
    "this reverse - color image clearly shows the complex x - ray spatial and spectral structure of this remnant .",
    "cyan ( blue color ) represents the 0.160.75 kev energy band ; magenta ( pink color ) represents the 0.750.96 kev band , and yellow represents the 0.966.64 kev band .",
    "these energy bands were chosen to obtain roughly equal numbers of counts in the integrated  spectrum of n63a .",
    "regions with equal emission in each band should appear black in figure 1a . in the southwestern and northern portions of the",
    "x - ray remnant crescent - shaped features protrude far beyond the edge of the main shell and appear bluish in color , indicating a relative enhancement in soft emission . a faint triangular region ( henceforth , `` hole '' ) , just west of center , is characterized by higher energy emission .",
    "the rest of the interior of the remnant shows similar levels of emission in all energy bands , although there is a broad greenish - yellow stripe that runs diagonally from the northeast to the southwest .",
    "sharp linear filaments extend across large portions of the remnant .",
    "relatively bright knots and clumps of emission can be seen northwest of center and in the east .",
    "images made in narrow x - ray energy bands reveal subtle but significant variations .",
    "the relative faintness of the triangular region is most prominent in the lowest energy band but becomes progressively less apparent toward higher energy . at the highest energies the remnant s emission fades slowly into the background .",
    "there is no hard unresolved x - ray source observed in n63a .",
    "the morphology of n63a varies strongly across the wavebands . in figure",
    "1b we present a color composite of the following : the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) 8638 mhz image @xcite in red , the _",
    "hubble _ space telescope wfpc2 h@xmath7 image @xcite in green , and the _ chandra _ 0.47 kev broadband image in blue .",
    "the brightest x - ray emission is toward the east where there is little to no radio emission .",
    "several compact optical knots evident in the image do not correlate well with similar - sized structures in either the x - ray or radio bands , although two appear near the brightest x - ray emission .",
    "the optical and brightest radio emission is broadly associated with the triangular hole in the x - ray emission .",
    "this is discussed more in section 4 .",
    "our preliminary studies of the  data suggested the presence of significant column density variations with position in n63a .",
    "we developed a simple technique to characterize the statistical significance of these variations and to obtain numerical estimates of the amount of absorption .",
    "initially we divided the entire remnant into regions containing at least 1000 counts , using an adaptive mesh , that resulted in 570 independent regions . for each region",
    "a spectrum was extracted over the 0.44.0 kev band and rebinned to a minimum of 25 events per channel .",
    "this was compared to the total observed spectrum of the remnant , which was rebinned in the same way .",
    "two simple models were used for this comparison : one assumed that each region s spectrum was simply a scaled - down version of the integrated spectrum ; the other allowed for both a scaling factor and an additional x - ray absorption factor ( hereafter @xmath8 ) .",
    "the latter used abundances reduced to 0.3 times solar , as appropriate to the lmc , to calculate @xmath8 .",
    "best - fit parameters in each case were determined by minimizing @xmath9 .",
    "we then compared these two values with the @xmath10-test to determine the significance of the fitted additional column density for each region .",
    "we did not put any _ a priori _ limits on @xmath8 .",
    "the most statistically significant @xmath10-values ( @xmath11 ) correspond to either highly negative or positive @xmath8 values .",
    "a negative @xmath8 naively suggests a region with lower than average absorbing line - of - sight column density , while a positive @xmath8 suggests a higher value .",
    "we plot these regions in figures 2b and 2c as soft and hard , respectively , where the grayscale encodes the value of @xmath8 .",
    "superposed on these images is a slightly smoothed version of the broadband image , which is shown ( unsmoothed ) in figure 2a .",
    "the regions of apparently negative @xmath12 are on the outer rim of the remnant , indicating spectral softening at the shell .",
    "we plot an example spectrum of such a region in figure 3b ( lower spectrum ) overlaid with the best - fit scale ( solid curve ) and absorption ( dotted curve ) models .",
    "this example illustrates how a negative @xmath8 enhances the lower energy portion of the spectrum .",
    "however , neither model provides a good fit because oxygen emission , i.e. , the lines at 0.53 and 0.65 kev , appears relatively enhanced in this particular spectrum .",
    "large positive column densities are found in interior regions of the remnant , especially in the vicinity of the triangular hole mentioned previously .",
    "we plot an example spectrum in figure 3c ( lower spectrum ) where the absorption model clearly provides a better fit than the scale model .",
    "much of the rest of the remnant shows @xmath10-values with low significance ( @xmath13 ) that correspond to @xmath8 near zero .",
    "these represent regions of mean spectra , as illustrated in figure 3a ( lower spectrum ) .      to confirm that the image analysis produced valid and numerically accurate results , we carried out spectral fits of nonequilibrium ionization ( nei ) thermal plasma models , using the planar shock model described in @xcite .",
    "we summed together a number of individual regions from the image analysis to obtain three well - sampled spectra , each containing at least 50,000 counts , corresponding to the soft , hard , and mean spectral regions identified above .",
    "the extraction region for the soft spectrum came from along the southeastern limb of the remnant , approximately centered at @xmath14 .",
    "the hard spectrum came from a region centered on @xmath15 and encompassing the darkest portions of the grayscale image of figure 2c .",
    "the mean spectrum was extracted from pixels , distributed throughout the interior of the snr , that had low significant ( @xmath16 ) @xmath10-values .",
    "these spectra are also plotted in figure 3 along with their best fit nei models ( upper spectra ) .",
    "we allowed the temperature , terminal value of the ionization timescale , column density , and the elemental abundances for each spectrum to be free parameters .",
    "again , the column density was determined using lmc abundances .",
    "the best - fitted parameter values are quoted in table 1 .",
    "abundances are lower than solar and generally consistent with the gas phase lmc values @xcite .",
    "the abundances are slightly elevated near the absorbed region , which can be seen in the form of somewhat stronger ne and mg line intensities ( compared to the mean spectrum ) in figure 3c .",
    "this result is less secure than the formal statistical errors would indicate , due to uncertainties in modelling the fe l - shell emission , and therefore we do not discuss this result further . also , there is a slight excess over the thermal model fits in the mean and especially hard spectra .",
    "although the statistics are low , the 3.37.0 kev band image , where this excess appears , generally resembles the rest of the x - ray remnant ; there is no particular enhancement at the site of the brightest radio or optical emission .",
    "the spectral fits for the integrated soft rim spectrum yield a lower column density and higher @xmath17 than the mean .",
    "we discuss these fits in more detail below .",
    "to compare the spectral - fit and image - analysis results , we had to average the values of @xmath8 from the image analysis over the larger regions used for the spectral study .",
    "this was done by taking an average , weighted by the number of counts , of the individual @xmath8 derived from each separate adaptive mesh pixel .",
    "these average values of @xmath8 ( see table 2 ) agree fairly well with the @xmath8 calculated from the difference between the soft or hard spectral fit @xmath18 and the value from the mean spectrum .",
    "this test validates the image analysis results and gives us confidence that the hard and soft regions identified in figure 2 do indeed differ significantly from the mean .",
    "@xcite estimated the interstellar reddening toward n63a to be @xmath19 = 0.25 , using the balmer decrement .",
    "from established correlations between @xmath18 and optical extinction @xcite and assuming @xmath20 @xcite , we obtain @xmath18 = ( 1.31.7 ) @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "this agrees nicely with our value for the mean @xmath23 @xmath22 and provides further confirmation of our spectral fits .",
    "as mentioned previously , we find no evidence from broadband images for a hard unresolved x - ray source in n63a .",
    "our image analysis technique , however , allows us to search the entire remnant for a region ( or regions ) that are dominated by any specific spectral form . to simulate the x - ray emission from a young pwn we used a power - law spectral model with photon index @xmath24 and again allowed the additional hydrogen column density to be free .",
    "none of the 570 regions provided an acceptable fit ( the minimum reduced-@xmath9 was 6.67 ) , indicating that nowhere within n63a is the emission dominated by a hard power - law spectrum .",
    "we determined a numerical upper limit to the flux of a hard source using an image from the 3.256.40 kev band , which is free of strong emission lines in the integrated spectrum .",
    "the 3@xmath25 count rate upper limit for an unresolved source anywhere in the interior of n63a is @xmath6 @xmath26 s@xmath3 or an unabsorbed 28 kev flux of @xmath27 ergs @xmath22 s@xmath3 .",
    "the limit for a source with a diameter of 2 pc , roughly the size of a young pwn , is @xmath6 @xmath28 s@xmath3 , implying an unabsorbed 28 kev flux of @xmath29 ergs @xmath22 s@xmath3 or luminosity of @xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "this limit allows us to rule out the presence of a bright pwn powered by a young , energetic pulsar like the crab , or the two already known in the lmc ( n157b and 0540@xmath3069 ) .",
    "however we can not exclude an older pwn , like the one in vela ( @xmath011,000 yr old ) , or one powered by an intrinsically weaker pulsar , such as the recently discovered pwn in the much younger ( @xmath01600 yr ) snr g292.0 + 1.8 @xcite .",
    "the crescent - shaped plumes in n63a resemble features seen in the _ rosat _ image of the vela supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "these are the only snrs where such features have been detected .",
    "the plumes in n63a extend from the main shock boundary , distorting the otherwise very symmetrical shape of the remnant .",
    "the largest one in the southwest reaches approximately 4.2 pc ( in projection ) beyond the main shock wave , the one just north of this protrudes about 3.5 pc , and the smaller northern region about 1.6 pc .",
    "the lateral size of the largest crescent feature is about 6 pc measured halfway out from the shell .",
    "these sizes should be compared to the 8.2 pc radius of the nearly circular main blast wave of n63a .",
    "three other crescent features appear closer in projection to the main shell in the northeast , east , and south .",
    "@xcite use two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to model the formation of such structures .",
    "they find that dense , high velocity clumps of ejecta may protrude beyond the forward shock as the remnant interacts with the surrounding medium .",
    "shocks moving through the clump at first crush it and then cause it to expand laterally , eventually taking on the shape of a crescent , such as is seen in n63a .    the origin of crescent - shaped features as ejecta is supported by @xcite , who found an overabundance of si in their study of vela shrapnel a. _ asca _ and  observations of vela bullet d show strong o , ne , and mg emission @xcite , suggesting an origin as a dense knot of supernova ejecta . however , @xcite argue that a nearly - solar abundance plasma far from ionization equilibrium is a more likely explanation for their observations .",
    "n63a is about 200 times more distant than vela , limiting our ability to do a similar detailed spectral study .",
    "we find that none of the crescent regions in n63a shows strongly enhanced abundances , although there is weak evidence for enhanced ne , mg , and si line emission at the apex of the northern crescent ( compared to the sides ) .",
    "we can confidently conclude that the plumes are not _ dominated _ by ejecta .",
    "thus , for the high - speed ejecta clump scenario to be correct , the clumps in n63a must be significantly mixed with ambient material , perhaps signalling the onset of their fragmentation and destruction .",
    "on the other hand , our image analysis has revealed that both the crescent - shaped regions and the entire rim of the snr show considerably softer spectra than average for n63a .",
    "this argues for a common origin in terms of shocked ism .",
    "however , confirmation of this hypothesis will require more careful study of spatially resolved x - ray spectra from these regions .",
    "based on models of snr evolution as well as other  observations ( e.g. rakowski et al .",
    "2002 ) , we expect the most rapid changes in the thermodynamic state of the post - shock gas to occur immediately behind the blast wave , and it is at the projected rim where these variations can be most cleanly resolved .",
    "it is somewhat puzzling , therefore , that our initial fits for the integrated soft rim spectrum appear to support a relatively lower column density , which , if taken literally , would imply a screen of absorbing matter covering most of the snr that falls off near the projected rim .",
    "we find this to be a rather contrived geometry and believe the low fitted value of @xmath18 , as well as the higher fitted value of @xmath17 , to be spurious and a result of our oversimplified spectral modelling , i.e. , the use of a single component nei planar shock model for a region with spatially varying spectral characteristics .",
    "in fact when the rim region is examined in finer detail , it is apparent that there is spectral evolution of the ionization state with position behind the shock front on scales of an arcsec or so , qualitatively showing the advance of post - shock ionization state .",
    "further work is in progress to study this effect and use it to quantify the dynamical state of the remnant .",
    "we interpret the hard region to be absorption by an intervening cloud in the lmc with a mass of @xmath0450 @xmath1 , determined by integrating the @xmath18 map over the extraction region for the spectrum in figure 3c .",
    "if we assume that the cloud s depth along the line - of - sight is roughly half of its length ( 3.8 pc ) , which is reasonable given our discussion below , then the mean density of the cloud is on the order of 250 @xmath31 .",
    "this value is consistent with estimates of @xmath050300 @xmath31 ( see shull 1983 and references cited therein ) for the preshock density of the optical remnant .",
    "two other smaller absorbing clouds , north and northeast of center , are roughly 20 - 30 @xmath1 in size .",
    "the large region of excess absorption is situated in nearly the same area as the bright radio and optical emission from n63a ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "to explain the x - ray absorption , the cloud must be on the near side of n63a with little to no residual x - ray emission coming from in front of it .",
    "the radio and optical emission signal the presence of slow shocks ( several 100 km s@xmath3 or less ) driven into the dense gas of the cloud .",
    "however , the modest extinction to the optical knots ( consistent with the mean @xmath18 to n63a rather than the higher value associated with the cloud ) means that we are predominantly seeing the shocks being driven into the _ near _ side of the cloud .",
    "this is further supported by the observation of only blue - shifted emission from the shock - heated optical lobes @xcite .",
    "in essence , then , we are viewing the dense cloud as it is being engulfed by the remnant s blast wave .",
    "the clumpy , knot - like features apparent in the absorption map and _ hst _ image suggest that the dense cloud s interaction with the blast wave is causing it to break - up and fragment . indeed the highest measured radial velocities in the optical band ( up to 250 km s@xmath3 )",
    "appear mainly around the edges of the lobes @xcite , while the interior portions appear to be moving toward us at less than half this speed .",
    "numerical simulations of an ism cloud overrun by a sn blast - wave ( e.g. , klein , mckee , & colella 1994 ) show , rather generically , that the edges of the cloud are accelerated more rapidly ( hence attaining higher speeds ) than the cloud core .",
    "when viewed perpendicular to the direction of motion of the blast wave , this results in a characteristic shape for the shocked cloud : the edges are swept forward along with the blast wave , while the core trails behind .",
    "an example of this type of interaction can be seen in an isolated cloud on the eastern limb of the cygnus loop @xcite . if the shocked cloud is viewed _ along _ the direction of the blast wave s motion , then the edges of the cloud should show higher radial velocities than the core .",
    "this situation appears , at least qualitatively , to describe the optical characteristics of n63a .",
    "further studies of this remnant across the wavebands should help to confirm this scenario and provide deeper insights into the interaction of snrs with their environments .",
    "we would like to thank cara rakowski for help on numerous issues as well as for allowing us to use her mesh program .",
    "we also thank john dickel for sharing his 6-cm radio image with us , parviz ghavamian for helpful discussions and comments on the text , and john nousek and dave burrows for assistance with the original proposal .",
