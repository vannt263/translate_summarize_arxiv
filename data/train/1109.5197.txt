    "mathematical models can be used as a framework to identify the key parts of a biological system , to perform _ in silico _ experiments and to understand the dynamical behaviour .",
    "there are mainly two mathematical frameworks used in modeling biological systems . the continuous framework , usually constructed by coupling differential equations , @xcite ; and the discrete framework , usually constructed by coupling multistate functions ( e.g. boolean functions ) , @xcite .    for many biological systems that have been modeled using both frameworks",
    ", it has been shown that both models have similar dynamical properties , @xcite ; this raises the question of when and why this happens .",
    "furthermore , it has been hypothesized that the dynamics of biochemical networks are constrained by the topological structure of the wiring diagram , @xcite . this in turn suggests that mathematical models describing the same biochemical phenomena should have similar behaviour , even if they come from different frameworks . by providing answers to these questions",
    "we can gain substantial biological insight and understand how biology works at the system level .",
    "this problem has been studied by several authors , @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the idea is that if a continuous model is `` sigmoidal enough '' and has the same qualitative features of a discrete model , then both models should have similar dynamics . in this paper",
    "we provide simple proofs about the relationship between steady states of continuous and discrete models satisfying these properties .",
    "our results generalize previous results in @xcite . furthermore",
    ", our proofs also show why the relationship between continuous and discrete models is likely to occur even when continuous models are not very sigmoidal .",
    "for a biochemical network with @xmath0 species , a mathematical model is typically of the form @xmath1 ; where @xmath2 denotes the concentration of species @xmath3 at time @xmath4 . given an initial condition @xmath5 , it is of interest to study the behaviour of @xmath6 as @xmath4 increases .",
    "there is usually no closed form of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath4 ( and @xmath7 ) , but rather equations that describe how @xmath8 s depend on each other .",
    "a system of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) that models a biochemical network is typically of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the elimination rate constant , corresponding to natural decay , and @xmath11 is a function that determines how the rate of change of @xmath8 at time @xmath4 depends on the value of the other species .",
    "we can represent this ode model as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a diagonal matrix .",
    "a multistate network or multivalued network ( mn ) that models a biochemical network is typically of the form @xmath15 ( notice that time is discrete ) ; where @xmath8 can take values in the finite set @xmath16 and @xmath17 determines how the future value of species @xmath3 depends on the current value of the others .",
    "we can represent this mn model as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "a multistate network is also called a finite dynamical system .",
    "examples of multistate networks include boolean networks , logical models and polynomial dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "for any modeling framework , the wiring diagram or dependency graph is defined as the graph with @xmath0 vertices , @xmath20 , and an edge from @xmath21 to @xmath3 if @xmath11 depends on @xmath22 .",
    "the edge is assigned a positive ( negative ) sign if @xmath11 is increasing ( decreasing ) with respect to @xmath22 .",

    "our goal is to relate the steady states of an ode and a mn ; that is , fixed points of @xmath31 and @xmath26 .",
    "we assume ( rescaling if necessary ) that the ode has the form @xmath32 where @xmath14 is a positive diagonal matrix and @xmath33^n\\rightarrow [ 0,1]^n$ ] .",
    "a mn is of the form @xmath34 .",
    "[ eg : toy ] our toy example consists of a 2-dimensional ode , @xmath35 , and a 2-dimensional mn , @xmath18 ; where @xmath36 ^ 2\\rightarrow [ 0,1]^2 $ ] and @xmath37 are given by :    @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a parameter .",
    "also , @xmath26 is given as a truth table :    @xmath41    notice that for our toy example @xmath14 is the identity matrix .",

    "notice that the jacobian matrix of @xmath76 is @xmath77 .",
    "suppose @xmath78 is an eigenvalue of @xmath77 .",
