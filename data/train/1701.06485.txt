    "* reciprocal space comparison with cuprates *        the sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 exhibits a very similar in - plane structure compared to superconducting cuprates . in cuprates , corner - shared cuo@xmath20 octahedra or cuo@xmath100 pyramids make a ( nearly ) square lattice of cuo@xmath1 plaquettes on the basal @xmath10-plane . on the other hand in iridates ,",
    "the iro@xmath20 octahedra are also corner - shared but rotated by @xmath101 in the basal plane . due to this in - plane rotation , the unit cell for iridates is doubled and rotated by 45@xmath102 as shown in fig .",

    "the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) structure is also almost the same in both systems , so the magnetic bragg conditions are also similar .",

    "[ figs2 ] , we compare a few interesting bragg @xmath48-positions in the planar reciprocal @xmath51-plane for iridates ( black ) and cuprates ( blue ) . for instance , the @xmath105 for the afm order in cuprates is transformed to @xmath49 or @xmath106 for iridates , and the @xmath49 in cuprates , where the loop - current ( lc ) order has been reported  @xcite , corresponds to @xmath50 for iridates .",
    "* coaligned single crystals and magnetization measurements *    we have investigated the pure and 7% rh - doped single crystals grown by flux method at laboratoire de physique des solides ( orsay ) .",
    "owing to a rectangular cuboid shape of the crystals , several tiny crystals could be coaligned in order to increase the total mass , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs1]a . to address the conventional antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order , the magnetization was measured under a magnetic field @xmath107  t using magnetic property measurement system ( mpms ) .",
    "the pure system originally exhibits an afm order , but it can easily show ferromagnetism , by applying a small external magnetic field @xmath108  t ( @xmath1092000  oe )  @xcite . for instance , the reported magnetic moment deduced from magnetization measurements shown in fig .",
    "[ figs1]b corresponds to a net ferromagnetic moment under 1  t. this ferromagnetism originates from a canting of the afm structure .",
    "the transition temperature is taken at the maximum slope in @xmath110 curve , i.e. , the minimum of the 1st derivative of magnetization , @xmath111 shown in fig .",
    "[ figs1]b .",
    "the pure system shows a sharp transition at @xmath112  k and the saturated ferromagnetic moment per ir ion is @xmath113 at 1 t . on the other hand",
    ", the doped one shows a broad transition near @xmath78  k and the moment is also reduced to @xmath114 . to map out the phase diagram ( fig.1a in the main text )",
    ", the transition temperatures for different doping levels were determined from the previous literatures  @xcite , following the same procedure .",
    "* experimental neutron scattering setup *    polarized neutron diffraction experiments were performed on the triple - axis spectrometer 4f1 located at the orphe reactor in saclay ( france ) .",
    "the polarized neutron setup was similar to the one used previously for studying cuprates  @xcite .",
    "a polarized incident neutron beam with @xmath115  mev ( @xmath116  @xmath96 ) is obtained by a polarizing supermirror ( bender ) and scattered neutrons are measured with a heusler analyzer which determines as well the final neutron polarization .",
    "a pyrolytic graphite filter is put before the bender to remove high harmonics . a small magnetic field of typically 10  g is applied using a helmholtz - like coil .",
    "it is used to change adiabatically the direction of the neutron polarization at the sample position .",
    "a mezei flipper is located before the sample position to flip the neutron spin . for each bragg position",
    ", the scattered neutron intensity is measured in both spin - flip ( sf ) and non - spin - flip ( nsf ) channels , that corresponds to two different states of the mezei flipper , flipper - off and flipper - on , respectively .",
    "one defines the flipping ratio @xmath117 of the bragg peaks intensities in both nsf and sf channels .",
    "it determines the polarization efficiency of the apparatus .",
    "due to unavoidable neutron polarization leakage from the nsf to the sf channel ( imperfect polarization ) , a value for fr was obtained between 3050 for the pure sample and 5065 for the doped sample . in order to measure a small magnetic signal on top of the large nuclear peak ,",
    "it is essential to keep very stable and homogeneous neutron polarization through the whole measurement . thus all the data have been measured at a fixed configuration of the spectrometer while changing the temperature .",
    "* analysis for the flipping ratio *    according to the ( co - planar ) loop current ( lc ) model , the magnetic scattering intensity should be observed at bragg reflections @xmath43 , on top of the nuclear scattering .",
    "as the lc phase respects the translation symmetry of the lattice , it corresponds to an intra - unit - cell magnetic order .",
    "thus , the detection of such a magnetic order critically depends on the ability to disentangle nuclear and magnetic scatterings .",
    "this difficulty can be overcomed by using polarized neutron scattering technique  @xcite . once the neutron spin polarization @xmath59 is set parallel to the transferred momentum , @xmath62 , the magnetic scattering purely appears in spin flip ( sf ) channel and the nuclear one in the non - spin - flip ( nsf ) channel . in principle , probing separately the sf and nsf scattering channels allows one to determine the magnetic and nuclear scatterings .",
    "however , polarized neutron experiments are always limited by the quality of the neutron spin polarization , which is given by @xmath118 , that should go to infinity for a perfectly polarized neutron beam . in practice ,",
    "@xmath118 is finite and a fraction @xmath119 of the nuclear ( _ i.e. _ nsf ) scattering goes into the sf channel : it is referred to as the polarization leakage that determines a corresponding bare flipping ratio @xmath120 .",
    "another important point is to determine possible temperature dependence of the bare flipping ratio @xmath121 . indeed , when changing the temperature , very tiny changes of the experimental set - up may occur@xcite , producing a continuous drift of @xmath121 that needs to be calibrated .",
    "in order to reveal a small magnetic signal on top of the nuclear polarization leakage in the sf channel , one has to pick up the weakest nuclear bragg peaks ( with the appropriate symmetry for the lc phase ) to get the better signal - to - background ratio .",
    "in addition , the magnetic form factor is generally suppressed at a high momentum transfer .",
    "considering these constraints , the @xmath122 reflection has been studied , which has the lowest @xmath123 of the allowed nuclear bragg peaks @xmath43 for the lc phase .",
    "further , in order to determine the temperature dependence of the bare flipping ratio , @xmath121 , a non - magnetic reference bragg peak is measured where the magnetic scattering is zero or small enough and where the spectrometer geometry is kept similar . here , we chose the @xmath124 bragg peak ( see fig .",
    "[ figs3]a ) as the reference because a magnetic signal is expected to be considerably reduced by the magnetic form factor and the spectrometer geometry is not changed much with respect to @xmath90 .",
    "using @xmath121 , obtained from the non - magnetic reference , one can then determine the intrinsic polarization leakage @xmath125 and next extract from the sf intensity @xmath60 the true magnetic one at @xmath90 , @xmath126 .",
    "for the pure sample , the @xmath127 at the @xmath124 is @xmath12839 at 300  k and it increases up to @xmath12845 at 100  k , meaning that @xmath129 ( reported in fig .",
    "[ figs3]b ) decreases upon cooling . that smooth decrease indicates no magnetic signal because one should observe a sudden increase of 1/fr in case of a magnetic order .",
    "the @xmath127 for the doped sample is higher ( @xmath12850 ) ( 1/fr @xmath130 reported in fig .",
    "[ figs3]b ) and much stable in temperature .",
    "that proves as well no magnetic signal at the @xmath124 peak in the doped sample .",
    "the observed temperature - dependent @xmath131 can therefore be taken as the bare @xmath129 for the polarization calibration .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath132 at the @xmath122 shows a clear change of slope around 200250  k as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs3]c , d .",
    "the @xmath132 is @xmath1283338 and @xmath1285063 for the pure and doped sample , respectively .",
    "this main difference of the magnitude of fr originates from different experimental conditions such as sample mosaicity , the number of blades on the analyzer and optimization of the guide field . in order to estimate the bare @xmath133 for the @xmath122 , the @xmath127",
    "is scaled by a factor that gives the same value with the @xmath132 at high temperature above 250  k. then , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs3]c - d , we clearly observe a departure of @xmath132 from @xmath133 at low temperature .",
    "using this @xmath134 , the bare polarization leakage , @xmath135 in the sf channel can be determined at @xmath90 . by subtracting it from the measured @xmath136 , the magnetic intensity",
    "can then be reported as , @xmath137 .",
    "we applied this method in the data analysis presented in fig .",
    "3 of the main manuscript .",
    "note that , for a quantitative comparison of the magnetic intensities of both samples , all raw intensities have been background - subtracted , normalized to the same monitor counts and weighted by an estimated sample weight .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ figs4 ] depicts scans of the nuclear bragg peak intensity at @xmath90 along @xmath138 in both samples . due to a broader mosaicity of coaligned crystals ,",
    "the peak width is broader in the doped sample . from fig .",
    "[ figs4 ] , one deduces the integrated intensity of the bragg peak , which is in the doped sample @xmath1281.6 times smaller than in the pure sample . taking that into account , one could compare the magnetic intensity of the observed hidden order around 240  k for both the pure and doped samples .",
    "we found a similar amount of the magnetic intensity in both samples as shown in fig .",
    "3b - c of the manuscript .",
    "* can an antiferromagnetic structure explain the hidden magnetic order at @xmath90 ?",
    "*    the fact that we have ascribed the magnetic intensity at @xmath90 to a hidden magnetic order deserves additional comments .",
    "briefly , the hidden order at @xmath90 can not be described by any stacking of the planar pseudo - spin , @xmath139 , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) pattern .",
    "below , we discuss different afm models considered in the literature :    first , in the afm @xmath26 model ( af - i ) , the magnetic intensity is expected at some @xmath140 .",
    "however , it should be zero for @xmath73=2 because it does not preserve the body - centered symmetry of the unit cell , so @xmath141 should be odd or @xmath142 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "a tiny magnetic intensity ( about a hundred times weaker than at @xmath55 ) has been reported at @xmath143 in pure @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "that contribution is much weaker than at @xmath58 because the magnetic intensity at @xmath140 is proportional to the non - collinear pattern of the ir moment .",
    "it is typically proportional to the square of the planar tilt angle of the iro@xmath20 octahedra , @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "second , in the afm @xmath27 model ( af - ii ) , a magnetic intensity at @xmath90 could exist in principle due to the ferromagnetic component .",
    "however , this interpretation can be excluded in both samples we have studied .",
    "first , in the pure sample , the ferromagnetic order is absent ( see fig.1 of the manuscript )  @xcite and can be only induced by an applied magnetic field of about 2000  oe  @xcite .",
    "second , under rh substitution , such a ferromagnetic order indeed develops but only below @xmath35  @xcite as it results from the canting of the afm order , clearly lower than @xmath79 .",
    "we therefore rule out the weak ferromagnetism derived from the canted afm order as a candidate to account for the observed magnetic scattering at @xmath90 .",
    "third , in the hypothethic @xmath147 model considered by di matteo and norman  @xcite , a magnetic intensity will be also present at some @xmath50 positions .",
    "the structure factor for the @xmath147 stacking is not zero only for even @xmath73 as it keeps the body - centered symmetry of the unit - cell .",
    "further , due to the glide plane , the structure factor is proportional to @xmath148 .",
    "actually , it gives zero intensity at @xmath122 and then is not consistent with our finding .",
    "further , such an afm phase , @xmath147 , would also lead to magnetic contributions at @xmath49 for odd @xmath73 , which are not observed in any neutron diffraction reports  @xcite in pure @xmath144 as well as shown in the fig .",
    "2d of the manuscript .",
    "finally , one should stress that magnetic contribution from any of these afm phases at @xmath50 would be negligible as it is systematially proportional to @xmath149 with @xmath146 .",
    "then , any effect around that @xmath98-position would be quantitatively too weak to be measured in our experiment . in absence of a planar tilt",
    ", it would even be strictly zero , although the signal for the lc phase will be still not zero ."

    "<S> the origin of that scattering is non - magnetic , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]c , d . for the bragg peak at @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> no signal is sizeable in the sf channel and only a nsf signal is observed above the background . </S>",
    "<S> these results exclude the possibility of an afm arrangement of @xmath39 type , where the magnetic signal should be only at odd @xmath73-value . </S>",
    "<S> it casts serious doubts that such an afm stacking can explain the origin of the shg signal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same conclusion holds for the @xmath27 arrangement , not observed in pure sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 , in full agreement with the literature  @xcite . to account for the occurrence of an odd - parity hidden order in shg measurements in pure sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> we are left with two scenarii . either </S>",
    "<S> , the missing afm orders are light - induced metastable states during the shg measurements , as suggested in ref .  , or another kind of magnetic order exists . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider now this second scenario .        </S>",
    "<S> the overall experimental procedure to extract the magnetic signal associated with the lc order is detailed in the supplementary note 4 and it follows methods established in previous works on superconducting cuprates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measured spin - flip intensity , @xmath60 , is reported as a function of temperature in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a for the pure sample . </S>",
    "<S> it is compared with the background baseline @xmath74 determined from the measured nsf intensity ( see the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a caption and supplementary note 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath74 decreases monotonically as temperature decreases , the sf intensity instead departs from @xmath74 below @xmath75  k. the difference , @xmath76 , evidences a spontaneous magnetic order whose magnetic intensity , @xmath77 , is reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b . </S>",
    "<S> it has a different symmetry compared to the conventional afm phases discussed above and the position corresponds to where magnetic intensity is expected for the lc phase . </S>",
    "<S> for the 7% rh - substituted sample , the same analysis is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c and d. while the afm transition is suppressed down to @xmath78  k , the novel magnetic order is observed at much higher temperature @xmath75  k. within error bars , the transition temperature , @xmath79 and its normalized magnetic intensity do not show a significant difference between the pure system and 7% rh - substitution . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the estimate of onset of the hidden order , @xmath80 , from shg ( orange squares in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a )  @xcite , which does not change appreciably with rh substitution . using the calibration of nuclear bragg peaks intensities </S>",
    "<S> , one can deduce the magnetic cross section of the hidden magnetic order as @xmath81  mbarns / f.u . </S>",
    "<S> , which is less than @xmath82 of the strongest nuclear bragg peak . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized magnitude of @xmath77 for the hidden magnetic order is similar in both samples and is @xmath83 times smaller than the one for the afm order , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] .    * discussion *    to understand the spontaneous magnetic order at @xmath79 , a model is needed to explain the broken symmetries of the hidden order . </S>",
    "<S> concomitant with the shg data , time - reversal , parity inversion and 4-fold rotational symmetries are broken . </S>",
    "<S> it preserves the translational symmetry of the underlying lattice , as the magnetic scattering appears on top of the nuclear bragg peak . </S>",
    "<S> the loop - current model  @xcite is a good candidate , since it can explain all these broken symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , more detailed and quantitative study is required to establish the exact order parameter in the hidden ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> the weak magnetic cross section shows how difficult it is to detect and why it was not reported with typical unpolarized neutron diffraction . due to the experimental limitations , </S>",
    "<S> a precise determination of the direction of induced magnetic moments and magnetic structure requires further works .    </S>",
    "<S> actually , other magnetic orders , which could potentially account for the shg data , are not consistent with our finding as they would give rise to distinct scattering patterns . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the proposed structure with @xmath38 point group  @xcite yields a different relation @xmath84 , as the configuration is opposite when one considers the @xmath85 translation . </S>",
    "<S> this breaks the original body - centered nuclear structure @xcite , and would give rise to magnetic superstructure peaks at @xmath86 and no magnetic intensity at any @xmath50 position . </S>",
    "<S> with rh doping , one also does not observe magnetic superstructures at @xmath49 with even @xmath73  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both points dismiss the proposal of the @xmath38 point group  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the shg measurements have been re - interpreted considering conventional afm orders  @xcite with a different stacking along the @xmath11-axis . </S>",
    "<S> we detail in the supplementary note 5 why the different afm structures discussed in the literature can not actually explain our observation . </S>",
    "<S> first , since the hidden order occurs at different @xmath48 positions compared to the afm order , it is clearly distinct with the af - i order . </S>",
    "<S> second , the afm state of @xmath37 symmetry with a @xmath39 stacking along the @xmath11-axis of afm planes is argued to explain shg data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phase will give rise to magnetic contributions at positions such as @xmath87 and nothing at @xmath50 , where we observe the hidden magnetic intensity . </S>",
    "<S> further , the non - magnetoelectric @xmath27 phase ( af - ii ) ( described above ) could also account for the shg data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this af - ii phase is reported in the rh - doped system  @xcite but is absent in the pure system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would also exhibit the largest magnetic contribution at @xmath87 as well as tiny magnetic contributions at bragg peaks , such as @xmath88 , due to its weak ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation can be excluded in both samples we have studied . </S>",
    "<S> first , in the pure sample , the ferromagnetic order is absent ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] )  @xcite and can be only induced by an applied magnetic field of about 0.2 t ( 2000  oe )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , under rh substitution , such a ferromagnetic order indeed develops , but only below @xmath35  @xcite , as it results from the canting of the afm order , clearly lower than @xmath79 . moreover , the neutron intensity due to ferromagnetism would be @xmath89 smaller than the afm one , i.e at least one order of magnitude smaller than the observed magnetic scattering we report here . </S>",
    "<S> all these arguments allow us to rule out the weak ferromagnetism derived from the canted afm order as a candidate to account for the observed magnetic scattering at @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our observation of a magnetic signal at @xmath90 is not consistent with any kind of stackings along the @xmath11-axis of the pseudo - spin afm orders considered to explain the shg signal in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    using polarized neutron diffraction , </S>",
    "<S> we have experimentally addressed all these alternative phases and found out evidence for a hidden magnetic order in sr@xmath1ir@xmath31rh@xmath32o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a translation - invariant but time - reversal symmetry broken phase that is consistent with the lc order of @xmath37 point group symmetry , concomitantly compatible with the shg signal . in that model , all iro@xmath20 octahedra , which are the building blocks of the material , are identically decorated by the same set of staggered magnetic moments , whose magnetism cancels out on each octahedron ( as depicted in fig .  [ fig1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this magnetic order is then clearly distinct from the afm one , where each octahedron has a single pseudo - spin on the ir site and where the nearest octahedra have staggered moments .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we report the first evidence of an unconventional magnetic order in sr@xmath1(ir , rh)o@xmath2 , which breaks time - reversal symmetry but preserves translational symmetry of the underlying lattice . by analogy with superconducting cuprates , where a similar kind of order is observed </S>",
    "<S> , one can refer to it as an intra - unit - cell order . </S>",
    "<S> the new magnetic phase overlaps with parity inversion and rotational symmetry broken phase recently reported using shg  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both observations can be described by the loop - current order  @xcite proposed for the pseudogap state in cuprates , where it is well supported by polarized neutron measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , the neutron observation in cuprates is confirmed as well by recent shg measurements that show a global broken inversion symmetry in yba@xmath1cu@xmath91o@xmath92  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may provide more analogy between the iridates and the high-@xmath93 cuprates , in spite of a different nature of @xmath4 and @xmath6 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> a noticeable difference is here that the loop order occurs in the insulating compounds at half - filling , whereas in cuprates it is observed in the doped metallic ( superconducting ) state . </S>",
    "<S> our report generalizes the existence of loop - current electronic states in oxides .    * </S>",
    "<S> methods : polarized neutron diffraction *    the polarized neutron experiments were performed on the triple axis spectrometer 4f1 ( orphe , saclay , france ) ( see supplementary note 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> all measurements were done in two different scattering planes , either @xmath52-@xmath53 or @xmath54-@xmath53 , where the scattering wave - vector is quoted as @xmath94 with @xmath95@xmath96 and @xmath97  @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> as emphasized in supplementary note 1 , in sr@xmath1(ir , rh)o@xmath2 , the conventional afm order is expected in the @xmath52-@xmath53 plane and the lc phase in the @xmath54-@xmath53 plane . for each wave - vector @xmath98 , </S>",
    "<S> the scattered intensity is measured in both spin - flip ( sf ) and non - spin - flip ( nsf ) channels . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron measurements have been performed with a neutron polarization @xmath62 where the magnetic signal appears entirely in the sf channel  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the af - i order was further studied with a polarization @xmath66 ( but still within the @xmath52-@xmath53 plane ) as well as with a polarization @xmath67 which is perpendicular to the scattering plane ( along @xmath99 in the given case ) . </S>",
