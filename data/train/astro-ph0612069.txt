    "there is a critical black hole mass above which @xmath5 is smaller than the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath6 ) , and the star is swallowed whole without disruption @xcite . for a solar - type star , @xmath7 .",
    "the luminosity and decay of a tidal disruption flare is dependent on the mass and spin of the central black hole , and can be used to directly probe dormant black holes in galaxies for which the sphere of influence of the black hole ( @xmath8 ) is unresolved , and a dynamical measurement of the black hole mass is not possible .",
    "the start of the flare , @xmath9 , occurs when the most tightly bound debris first returns to pericenter ( @xmath10 ) after the star is disrupted at time t@xmath11 , where    ( @xmath12 yr    ( li et al .  2002 ) , and @xmath13 for a star with no spin , and @xmath14 for a star that is spun up by tidal interactions to near break - up on disruption . after @xmath9 , the return rate of the bound debris to pericenter declines as function of time as @xmath15^{-5/3}$ ] @xcite , which determines the characteristic power - law decay of the luminosity of the flare over the following months and years . when the mass accretion rate is super - eddington ,    @xmath16 ,    where @xmath17 is the efficiency of converting mass into radiation , the debris is accreted in a thick disk that radiates close to the eddington luminosity @xcite , @xmath18 ergs s@xmath19 .",
    "the spectrum of a tidal disruption event can thus be characterized by the blackbody temperature of a thick disk radiating at @xmath20 at radii ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath10 , @xmath21 , which for a solar - type star is @xmath22 k , and peaks in the extreme - uv @xcite .    the most unambiguous cases for a stellar disruption occur from host galaxies with no evidence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) for which an upward fluctuation in the accretion rate could also explain a luminous uv / x - ray flare .",
    "a uv flare from the nucleus of the elliptical galaxy ngc 4552 was proposed to be the result of the tidal stripping of a stellar atmosphere @xcite ; however the possible presence of a persistent , low - luminosity agn detected in hard x - rays ( xu et al .",
    "2005 ) makes this interpretation uncertain .",
    "the _ rosat _ all - sky survey conducted in 19901991 sampled hundreds of thousands of galaxies in the soft x - ray band , and detected luminous ( @xmath23 ergs s@xmath19 ) , soft [ @xmath24 k ] x - ray flares from several galaxies with no previous evidence for agn activity , and with a flare rate of @xmath25 yr@xmath19 per galaxy @xcite , that is consistent with the theoretical stellar disruption rate .",
    "a decade later , follow - up _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of three of the galaxies demonstrated that they had faded by factors of @xmath26 , consistent with the ( @xmath27 decay of a tidal disruption flare ( komossa et al .  2004 ; halpern et al .",

    "we initiated a program to take advantage of the uv sensitivity , large volume , and temporal sampling of the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) deep imaging survey ( dis ) to search for stellar disruptions in the nuclei of galaxies over a large range of redshifts .",
    "the dis covers 80 deg@xmath28 of sky in the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ; @xmath29 ) and near - ultraviolet ( nuv ; @xmath30 ) with a total exposure time of 30150 ks , that is accumulated in @xmath31 ks eclipses ( when the satellite s 98.6 minute orbit is in the shadow of the earth ) .",

    "we marginally detect faint narrow [ o  iii ] @xmath445007 line emission with @xmath45([o  iii ] ) = @xmath46 ergs s@xmath19 .",

    "the correlation between @xmath45([o  iii ] ) and @xmath47(320 kev ) observed for local agns @xcite predicts @xmath45([o  iii ] ) @xmath50 ergs s@xmath19 , which suggests that the possible [ o  iii ] line emission has too high an @xmath45([o  iii])/l@xmath51 ratio to be associated with agn activity , and may be from low levels of star formation .",
    "we obtained a follow - up spectrum after the flare discovery on 2006 june 1 with the double spectrograph on the palomar 200 inch telescope , and again detected no strong emission lines .",
    "cfhtls variability monitoring data from 2005 january to june show no detection of a variable optical source in the galaxy , with up to 5 observations per month with a sensitivity of @xmath52 .",
    "the lack of variable optical emission during the uv flare puts an important constraint on its nature .",
    "supernovae ( sne ) have light curves that extend over months , similar to the flare observed here , but their emission peaks at optical wavelengths , and is intrinsically faint shortward of @xmath38 3000   @xcite . gamma ray bursts ( grbs )",
    "have power - law decays , but again , their emission is brighter at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the characteristic power - law continuum of agn emission extends from optical to extreme - uv as @xmath53 , where 0.43 @xmath54 2 @xcite .",
    "if the uv flare were an upward fluctuation of agn continuum emission , a power - law spectrum with @xmath55 would produce an optical source with @xmath56 23 mag during the cfhtls observations and power a broad h@xmath57 line with a luminosity of  -.5ex  1 @xmath58 ergs s@xmath19 @xcite at the time of the keck spectrum , both of which are definitively ruled out by the observations . in summary , the flare is most probably not due to agn activity because it displays ( 1 ) no optical variability , ( 2 ) no broad emission lines , ( 3 ) a soft x - ray spectrum with no hard x - ray component , and ( 4 ) an early - type galaxy spectrum with possible narrow [ o  iii ] emission with a high [ o  iii]/l@xmath51 ratio characteristic of star formation .",
    "in addition , a sn or grb origin is unlikely because of the high uv / optical ratio .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the flare from optical to x - rays on 2005 april 7 is shown in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "a blackbody fit to the sed is strongly constrained by the soft x - ray flux density , which is best fit for a rest - frame @xmath59 k , shown with a solid line in figure [ fig : sed ] , which for @xmath60 , corresponds to @xmath61 cm and @xmath62 ergs s@xmath19 .",
    "the steep wein s tail of the blackbody curve is consistent with the extremely soft spectral slope of the x - ray source .",
    "however , since the x - ray flux varies on a short timescale , and only appears above the detection threshold for part of the observations , we consider this fit an upper limit to @xmath63 for the duration of the flare .",
    "the lowest @xmath63 that is consistent with the uv flux densities and the optical upper limits is @xmath38 1 @xmath64 k , shown with a dashed line in figure [ fig : sed ] , which corresponds to @xmath65 cm and @xmath66 ergs s@xmath19 .",
    "this range of temperatures and luminosities is in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions for a tidal disruption flare .",
    "the characteristic tidal disruption ( @xmath67)@xmath68 power - law decay fit to the uv light curve yields a best - fit time of disruption of @xmath69=2003.3 @xmath70 0.2 .",
    "if we allow the power - law index of the decay , ( @xmath67)@xmath71 , to vary as well as @xmath69 , we get a comparable fit , but with much less constrained values for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the _ galex _ observations do not cover the rise of the uv flux to its peak value , however we can constrain the time of the peak ( t@xmath74 ) to be between the time of the _ galex _ detection beginning on 2004 march 25 and the latest date of the non - detection on 2003 june 29 , ( @xmath75 yr .",
    "we estimate the total energy released during the flare by integrating the best - fit ( @xmath67)@xmath68 light curve from the time of the peak of the flare to infinity , @xmath76 .",
    "if on 2005 april 67 , @xmath77 ergs s@xmath78 ergs s@xmath19 , and ( @xmath79 ) @xmath80 @xmath81 yr , this yields a minimum total energy released of @xmath82 ergs @xmath83 ergs , and a minimum mass accreted , @xmath84 , of @xmath85 , assuming @xmath86 k during the flare .    for a solar - type star , the limits on ( @xmath79 ) imply @xmath87 , where @xmath88 depends on the spin - up of the star , with a hard upper limit on the black hole mass of @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , in order to satisfy the condition that @xmath92 , and a stellar disruption can occur .",
    "the radius of the flare emission also places constraints on @xmath93 .",
    "the debris disk should form within the tidal disruption radius of the central black hole .",
    "the blackbody fits to the flare sed have @xmath94 cm which , if @xmath95 , places a lower limit on the black hole mass of @xmath96 .",
    "the radius of the emission should also be greater than the minimum stable particle orbit for the black hole ( @xmath97 ) , which ranges from @xmath98 for a black hole with no spin , down to @xmath97 = @xmath99 for a maximally spinning black hole , where r@xmath100 . for @xmath101 ,",
    "this requires that @xmath102 , and is consistent with @xmath103 for a solar - type star . we can also use the strong correlation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion established for local galaxies @xcite ,",
    "log(@xmath104 km s@xmath19 ) , to estimate @xmath93 .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion within the half - light radius ( @xmath105 ) of the bulge of the galaxy , @xmath106 km s@xmath19 , yields a mass of @xmath107 , where the 1@xmath108 error includes the intrisic scatter of the correlation of @xmath38 0.3 dex .    to summarize , the black hole mass estimated from the @xmath109 relation ( @xmath110 ) is consistent with the constraints on the black hole mass from the blackbody spectrum such that @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , with the limits derived from the time delay between the time of the disruption and the peak of the flare ( @xmath87 ) , and with the condition that @xmath113 for a solar - type star to be disrupted .",
    "it is encouraging that these various _ independent _ black hole mass estimates are in agreement with each other as long as @xmath114 , and the star was not spun - up to near break - up on disruption .",
    "the _ galex _",
    "dis has proven to be a promising survey for detecting stellar disruption events so far . with a larger sample of tidal disruption flares",
    ", we can begin to measure the distribution of masses and spins of black holes in the nuclei of normal galaxies as a function of redshift , unbiased by the minority of galaxies that are agns .",
