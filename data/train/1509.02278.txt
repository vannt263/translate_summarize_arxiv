    "<S> we analyze high multiplicity proton - proton ( @xmath0 ) collision data in the framework of the string percolation model ( spm ) that has been successful in describing several phenomena of multiparticle production , including the signatures of recent discovery of strongly interacting partonic matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> our study in terms of the ratio of shear viscosity and entropy density ( @xmath1 ) and the ( lqcd ) predicted signature of qcd change of phase , in terms of effective number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath2 ) , reiterates the possibility of strongly interacting collective medium in these events .    </S>",
    "<S> the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , an exotic state of matter of partonic degrees of freedom , is predicted @xcite by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) the theory of strong interaction . </S>",
    "<S> experiments with relativistically colliding heavy nuclei at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory revealed features @xcite , expected from qgp - like dense partonic medium . </S>",
    "<S> relativistic hydrodynamics helped in identifying the collective nature of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> unpredictably , however , the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density ( @xmath3 ) , the measure of fluidity , at the rhic heavy - ion collisions reached a value @xcite close to that for a perfect fluid , indicating formation of a strongly interacting medium , termed as sqgp . </S>",
    "<S> recent heavy - ion data from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern with heavier nuclei and at higher energy corroborates @xcite most of the rhic findings . in this scenario of the qgp study , an unexpected feature , namely the `` ridge '' in the long range near side angular correlation , in distinct class of `` high multiplicity '' events of proton - proton collisions @xcite at @xmath4 7 tev at lhc </S>",
    "<S> has triggered revival of an old school of thought @xcite of the possibility of formation of a collective medium in @xmath0 collisions also . </S>",
    "<S> several of subsequent theoretical and phenomenological studies @xcite , in different approaches , endorse the possibility , indicating the need for further investigations in understanding the high - multiplicity @xmath0 events vis - a - vis the qgp .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we address the issue of collectivity in high multiplicity @xmath0 events in the framework of the string percolation model , that has successfully explained the collectivity and the change of phase in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also spm describes the centre - of - mass energy dependence of mid - rapidity multiplicity @xcite and the pseudorapidity distributions @xcite of produced charged particles in @xmath0 collisions , for the entire range of energy , available so far . in the spm , </S>",
    "<S> the sources of multiparticle productions are the color strings between the colliding partons . </S>",
    "<S> the stretched strings between the partons decay into new pairs of partons and so new strings are formed . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , particles are produced from interaction of partons by the schwinger mechanism . with the increasing energy of collision and / or the size of the colliding system , the density of the string increases and they start to overlap forming clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the overlapped strings start interacting . at a certain critical density , </S>",
    "<S> the strings start percolating through one another , forming a macroscopic cluster of strings - a geometrical phase transition takes place . the cluster of percolated color strings is considered to be equivalent to the de - confined partonic state of matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there has been considerable progress in the spm in establishing connection @xcite between the percolation phase transition of color strings and the qcd phase transition in heavy - ion collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the cardinal parameters in spm is the transverse impact parameter density of strings , @xmath5 . for @xmath0 collisions , @xcite </S>",
    "<S> one can write @xmath6 where @xmath7 is @xmath8 fm the single string transverse size , @xmath9 fm is the proton transverse size and @xmath10 is the average number of single strings . for values of @xmath5 above the critical value for the 2-dimensional percolation , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , depending on the profile function homogeneous or wood saxon type ) , @xmath13 , one observes the formation of long strings due to fusion and stretching between the colliding nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> other important quantity in spm is the color suppression factor , f(@xmath5 ) , which is related to the particle density @xmath14 and the number ( @xmath15 ) of strings as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a normalization factor @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath19 slows down the rate of increase in particle density with energy and with the number of strings .    for @xmath0 collisions one can approximately write @xmath20 with @xmath21 the mass of the proton and @xmath22 a constant parameter @xmath23 @xcite .    by measuring @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath24 - dependent identified particle spectra from @xmath0 collisions at @xmath25 = 0.9 , 2.76 and 7 tev , the cms experiment at the lhc provides the unique opportunity for somewhat `` centrality '' dependent study in @xmath0 collisions . to determine the corresponding value of the string density , we use the invariant transverse momentum spectra given by a power law : @xmath26^{\\alpha}}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are energy dependent parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the total multiplicity is obtained by the mean over all the clusters configurations @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total number of clusters in a event and @xmath31 the number of strings that form the @xmath32 cluster . </S>",
    "<S> considering only the clusters which contributes to the central region the general formula : @xmath33 with @xmath34 and similarly @xmath35 by using equation ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) and ( 3 ) we can describe the general equation that relates the high multiplicity ( with string density @xmath36 ) and min bias distributions as :    @xmath37    with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , by applying the thermodynamic limit with a vectorial color sum @xmath40 . </S>",

    "<S> the fit is restricted to @xmath46 gev / c to avoid the effect of resonance decays . for @xmath47 , </S>",
    "<S> we have taken into account the kinematics cuts , by scaling the measured @xmath48 with the corresponding factor of ( @xmath49 ) corresponding to the @xmath50 range and the factor ( @xmath51 ) as in @xcite corresponding to the @xmath52 cut range .     7 tev in @xmath53 collisions for different multiplicity classes from @xmath54 grey line to @xmath55 orange line . </S>",
    "<S> data taken from reference @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 show the dependence of the obtained color reduction factor @xmath56 with the corresponding @xmath57 respectively at different energies , it indicates that at the same multiplicity class the string density decreases for higher energies .        </S>",
    "<S> the schwinger mechanism @xcite for massless particles is given by the expression @xmath58 which can be related to the average value of the string tension @xmath59 @xcite , this value fluctuates around its mean value because the chromoelectric field is not constant , the fluctuations of the chromo electric field strength lead to a gaussian distribution of the string tension that transform it into a thermal distribution , where the temperature is given by the relation @xcite @xmath60    . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we consider that the experimentally determined chemical freeze out temperature is a good measure of the phase transition temperature @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the effective temperature , @xmath62 , from the equation ( 10 ) , for each multiplicity class for a critical density @xmath63 and at the critical temperature @xmath64 mev , as obtained by the latest lqcd results from the hotlqcd collaboration @xcite , with the corresponding @xmath65 mev / c consistent with the measured of direct photon enhanced measured @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows the increase of calculated @xmath62 with the increase of the multiplicity @xmath66 .     to @xmath54 , with the @xmath67 mev . ]    in terms of the effective temperature one can study some useful quantities as the ratio of the shear viscosity over entropy density , mean transverse momentum and the ratio of energy density over @xmath68 as it shown in the following lines :    in the relativistic kinetic theory as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mean free path @xmath71 , n is the density of the effective number of sources per unit volume and @xmath72 is the transport cross section , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> it is considered that @xmath74 considering @xmath75 the longitudinal extension of the source one can give the relation @xmath1 in terms of @xmath5 @xcite , as : @xmath76    the @xmath1 as a function of @xmath77 as obtained from the spm formalism for the @xmath0 data @xcite is shown in figure 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the plot shows similar features as has been exhibited by the heavy - ion data @xcite @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the mean transverse momentum can also described from ( 6 ) as an inverse function of the color reduction factor @xmath78 the figure 5 clearly shows that the spm model describes the measured @xcite @xmath79 -dependence of @xmath80 .    in spm </S>",
    "<S> the energy density can be determined by a temperature at string level , by using the energy density from bjorken @xmath81 , with the nuclear overlap area @xmath82 , and taking the production time for a boson gluon ( @xmath83 ) @xcite as the propagation time of the parton given in fermi ( @xmath84 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figure 6 .        </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath79-dependence @xmath85 of the @xmath0 data at the lhc energies is well described by the string percolation model . </S>",
    "<S> besides , in terms of the ratio of shear viscosity and entropy density ( @xmath1 ) and the ( lqcd ) predicted signature of qcd change of phase , in terms of effective number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath2 ) , the model gives a clear indication of the phase transition for the measured high multiplicity @xmath0 events . </S>",
    "<S> of course , there have been several other models to describe the unexpected behavior of high multiplicity @xmath0 events . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , till one can analyze expected high statistics of high multiplicity @xmath0 events at @xmath86 = 13 tev , in the run-2 of lhc , the spm provides one of the possible explanations for the observed unexpected features of the @xmath0 data at lhc energies . </S>"
