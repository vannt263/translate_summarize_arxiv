    "thus , while these quantities are generally related , systems with low or intermediate pah equivalent widths appear to have a range of compactness ( as diagnosed by [ c  ii]/l@xmath16 ) and so the pah eqw and [ c  ii]deficit appear to be semi - independent . that the hcn  ( 10)/hco@xmath2  ( 10 ) ratio does not correlate well with either , suggests the origin of hcn enhancement can not be easily assigned solely to agn or to the presence of a compact starburst .      the strong mid - infrared continuum present in many ( u)lirgs may also influence these line ratios",
    ". the hcn molecule has degenerate bending modes in the infrared and can absorb mid - infrared photons ( @xmath96 ) to its first vibrational state .",
    "the transitions have high level energies ( @xmath97 k ) and mid - ir emission with a brightness temperature of at least 100 k is necessary to excite them @xcite . a sign that infrared pumping of hcn is taking place",
    "is the presence of line emission from rotational transitions within the vibrational band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it may be possible for hcn to be infrared pumped without detectable emission from these rotational - vibrational lines . when the brightness temperature is close to the lower limit for pumping , the excitation of the rotational - vibrational line is so low that it takes a very large column density to result in a large enough optical depth for this rotational - vibrational line to be detected .    several sources in our sample",
    "do show evidence for infrared absorption at @xmath96 which could be associated with pumping of hcn @xcite , but none of the starburst systems with enhanced hcn emission show @xmath96 absorption in the spitzer / irs observations from @xcite .",
    "hco@xmath2 is similarly susceptible to infrared pumping , via a @xmath98 line ; using the irs high - resolution spectroscopy from @xcite we searched for a @xmath98 absorption feature in those systems with high ratios , where we postulated mid - infrared pumping could be important .",
    "we did not find any evidence for hco@xmath2 absorption .",
    "however , it is not clear that existing mid - infrared observations are sensitive enough to establish firm upper limits on the importance of infrared pumping .",
    "existing spectroscopy may not have the sensitivity to identify absorption which is sufficient to affect level populations .",
    "an obvious question is whether or not the pah eqw is a robust measure of agn strength in ( u)lirgs .",
    "@xcite present interferometric observations of several objects , including the composite source cgcg 049 - 057 , one of our sources with enhanced hcn emission .",
    "the hcn  ( 32 ) @xmath99 and hco@xmath2  ( 32 ) lines show evidence for significant self absorption and the hcn  ( 32 ) @xmath100 ro - vibrational line is detected ( consistent with mid - infrared pumping ) .",
    "@xcite interpret this as evidence for a very compact ( tens of pc ) warm ( @xmath101 k ) region surrounded by a large envelope of cooler , more diffuse gas .",
    "the total column density through these systems is likely quite high ( @xmath102 @xmath103 ) .",
    "if the column densities are sufficiently high to support mid - infrared pumping , the optical depths in the infrared may be high enough that the mid - infrared continuum level does not trace the intrinsic energy source  thus the pah eqw diagnostic may miss highly embedded agn .    in section",
    "[ sec : aperture ] we note that the pah eqw is an upper limit to the agn s influence on large scales , but this measurement could also be considered as a lower limit to the agn s influence on smaller scales .",
    "thus , consistent with results of @xcite for cgcg 047 - 059 , it is possible that these starburst or composite sources with high hcn  ( 10)/hco@xmath2  ( 10 ) ratios host embedded agn , and substantial mid - infrared optical depths result in an under - estimate of the agn s influence when using the pah eqw .      though we have shown in this study that some starburst - dominated systems have global l@xmath4/l@xmath5 ratios in excess of unity , the starburst - dominated systems outnumber agn - dominated systems in the present sample",
    "more iram 30 m single - dish observations of agn - dominated ( u)lirgs would be useful to study the dense - gas tracers in that population , particularly to see if the absence of agn - dominated sources with low l@xmath4/l@xmath5 ratios is truly representative or merely reflects small number statistics .",
    "spatially resolved comparisons of the hcn emission with co or hco@xmath2 have been undertaken for systems known to host an agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it would be instructive to perform the same exercise on starburst dominated systems .",
    "the atacama large millimeter / sub - millimeter array is the natural instrument for this , and such a study could investigate the spatial variation in the l@xmath4/l@xmath5 ratio for starbursts . if the ratio peaks on the nucleus but is low elsewhere ( as in systems with agn ) , does that correspond to a compact mid - infrared emitting region ?",
    "spatially resolving this ratio in starburst systems with both high and low ratios may enable a separation of the relative importance of source compactness and/or mid - infrared pumping , in setting the ratio .",
    "@xcite studied the emission of multiple hcn and hco@xmath2 transitions for twelve systems , finding evidence for systematic differences in the hcn  ( 10)/hco@xmath2  ( 10 ) and hcn  ( 32)/hco@xmath2  ( 32 ) ratios between agn and starbursts , with agn having values @xmath104 for both ratios .",
    "they also found evidence that the ( 32)/(10 ) ratio for both hcn and hco@xmath2 varies between agn and starbursts .",
    "the number of goals objects with ( 32 ) measurements of hcn and hco@xmath2 is currently too small to draw conclusions regarding the ( 32)/(10 ) ratios as a function of agn strength , but it would be possibly illuminating to compare the higher j@xmath105 transitions with the agn diagnostic used here .",
    "the discovery of mid - infrared pumping and associated high - column densities in enhanced hcn sources suggests that even mid - infrared diagnostics such as the pah eqw may miss highly embedded agn .",
    "if this is the case , hard x - ray observations may provide the only conclusive evidence for agn in sources with heavily obscured nuclei .",
    "however , the weakness of the @xmath106 kev x - rays in ulirg agn ( e.g. , mrk 231 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may make these observations difficult with existing facilities .    finally , the influence of infrared pumping is still uncertain .",
    "future mid - infrared observations of these sources with the james webb space telescope would provide tighter constraints on the importance and ubiquity of mid - infrared pumping , for both hcn and hco@xmath2 . see also @xcite for a discussion on using resolved observations to distinguish mid - infrared pumping and xdr scenarios .",
    "we now turn to the relationship between the hcn  ( 10 ) emission and the star formation rates in ( u)lirgs . while hcn  ( 10 ) is generally taken to trace the mass of dense molecular gas , m@xmath107 , previous studies have found conflicting results for the relationship between l@xmath9and l@xmath4 . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfrelation ]  ( left ) we plot the standard relation between l@xmath4 and l@xmath9including additional measurements from ( * ? ? ? * with values corrected to our assumed cosmology and for the 3-attractor model of @xcite ) .",
    "we fit the relationship using a maximum likelihood technique , considering the errors in both l@xmath9and l@xmath4 ( e.g. , sec 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "when uncertainties for mm - line fluxes were not quoted in the literature , we assume 20% .",
    "uncertainties on the fit parameters were determined using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampling and quoted fit parameter uncertainties are for the 99% confidence interval .    to this point , we have not considered systematic uncertainties in our new observations , as the simultaneous measurement of hcn and hco@xmath2 should result in significantly reduced systematic uncertainties in the hcn / hco@xmath2 ratio , in the hcn / hco@xmath2 ratio , compared to non - simultaneous measurements . however , for the present comparison of l@xmath9with these lines , the absolute flux of these lines may be subject to systematic uncertainties .",
    "we tested two approaches for dealing with systematic uncertainties : 1 ) assigning additional systematic uncertainties ( equal in magnitude to the statistical uncertainties ) to each datapoint and fitting the relationship , or 2 ) including only statistical uncertainties and allowing for additional uncertainties in the fitting process .",
    "in addition to fitting for the slope and intercept , we included an additional `` nuisance '' parameter , @xmath108 , in the likelihood function to fit for the fractional amount by which the uncertainties are underestimated ( e.g. , due to not explicitly including systematic uncertainties ) .",
    "after the mcmc sampling , we marginalized over @xmath108 when determining the final uncertainties for the slope and intercept .",
    "both approaches yielded the same results for the best - fit relations , so we conclude that our fitting process appropriately accounts for non - statistical uncertainties and present the numerical results from the latter approach . for consistency , we show only the statistical uncertainties for values plotted in figures  [ fig : sfrelation ] and [ fig : sftracer ] .    our best fit relation to our new data combined with the literature data ( omitting both agn - dominated systems , in which l@xmath9may not solely trace star formation , and hcn  ( 10 ) upper limits ) between l@xmath9and l@xmath4 is :    @xmath109    this fit is shown in figure  [ fig : sfrelation ]  ( left ) as the solid line .",
    "we also fit l@xmath4l@xmath9 , fixing the slope to be linear , which we show in figure  [ fig : sfrelation ]  ( left ) as a dashed line .",
    "the slope of the l@xmath4l@xmath9relation is consistent with being linear at the @xmath110 level .",
    "we note that @xcite found the l@xmath4l@xmath111$]relation to be steeper than linear , with a slope of @xmath112 ( 68 % confidence interval ) .         in figure",
    "[ fig : sfrelation ]  ( right ) we perform the same comparison , but utilizing l@xmath5 instead of l@xmath4 . as hco@xmath2  ( 10 ) has a higher critical density than co  ( 10 ) , but lower than hcn  ( 10 ) , it is useful to test if it is also linearly tracked by the sfr .",
    "the l@xmath5l@xmath9relation is also consistent with linear :    @xmath113    thus , our results are consistent with scenarios in which the hcn and hco@xmath2 emission both trace the dense gas associated with ongoing star formation , albeit with scatter , likely the result of one or more of the excitation mechanisms discussed in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the inclusion of the @xcite hcn observations adds in a substantial number of galaxies with l@xmath9@xmath114 l@xmath18 , but corresponding hco@xmath2  ( 10 ) observations are not available . in order to assess the degree to which these lower - luminosity systems influence our fitting results",
