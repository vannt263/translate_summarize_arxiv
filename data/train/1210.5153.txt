    "one important aspect of the study of dynamical systems is the study of noise on the underlying deterministic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "although one might expect the deterministic dynamics would be only slightly perturbed in the presence of small noise , there are now many examples where noise causes a dramatic measurable change in behavior , such as noise induced switching between attractors in continuous systems @xcite , and noise induced extinction in finite size systems @xcite .    in systems transitioning between coexisting stable states ,",
    "much research has been done primarily because switching can be now investigated for a large variety of well - controlled micro- and mesoscopic systems , such as trapped electrons and atoms , josephson junctions , and nano- and micro - mechanical oscillators @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "observed fluctuations are usually due to thermal or externally applied noise . however , as systems become smaller , an increasingly important role may be played also by non - gaussian noise .",
    "it may come , for example , from one or a few two - state fluctuators hopping at random between the states , in which case the noise may be often described as a telegraph noise .",
    "it may also be induced by poisson noise @xcite .    in finite size populations or systems",
    ", extinction occurs in discrete , finite populations undergoing stochastic effects due to random transitions or perturbations .",
    "the origins of stochasticity may be internal to the system or may arise from the external environment  @xcite , and in most cases is non - gaussian  @xcite .",
    "extinction depends on the nature and strength of the noise  @xcite , outbreak amplitude  @xcite and seasonal phase occurrence  @xcite . for large populations ,",
    "the intensity of internal population noise is generally small .",
    "however , a rare , large fluctuation can occur with non - zero probability and the system may be able to reach the extinct state .",
    "since the extinct state is absorbing due to effective stochastic forces , eventual extinction is guaranteed when there is no source of reintroduction  @xcite .",
    "models of finite populations , which include extinction processes , are effectively described using the master equation formalism , and predict probabilities of rare events  @xcite . for many problems involving extinction in large populations ,",
    "if the probability distribution of the population is quasi - stationary , the probability of extinction is a function that decreases exponentially with increasing population size .",
    "the exponent in this function scales as a deterministic quantity called the action  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that a trajectory that brings the system to extinction is very likely to lie along a most probable path , called the optimal path .",
    "it is a major property that a deterministic quantity such as the action can predict the probability of extinction , which is inherently a stochastic process , and is also formulated in continuous systems driven by noise  @xcite .",
    "locating the optimal path is important since the quantity of interest , whether it is the switching or extinction rate , depends on the probability to traverse this path .",
    "therefore , a stochastic control strategy based on the switching or extinction rates can be determined by its effect on the optimal path  @xcite .",
    "the optimal path formalism converts the entire stochastic problem to a mechanistic dynamical systems problem with definitive properties .",
    "first , the optimal path is a solution to a hamiltonian dynamical system . in the case of continuous stochastic models ,",
    "the dimension of the system is twice that of the original stochastic problem .",
    "the other dimensions are conjugate momenta , and typically represent the physical force of the noise which induces escape from a basin of attraction to either switch or go extinct .",
    "finally , due to the symplectic structure of the resulting hamiltonian system , it can be shown that both attractors and saddles of the original system become saddles of the hamiltonian system .",
    "one of the main obstacles to finding the optimal path is that it is an inherently unstable object .",
    "that is , if one one starts near the path described by the hamiltonian system , then after a short time , the dynamics leaves the neighborhood of the path .",
    "in addition , although the path may be hyperbolic near the saddle points , it may not be hyperbolic along the rest of the path .",
    "solving such problems using shooting methods for simple epidemic models  @xcite , or mixed shooting using forward and backward iteration  @xcite will in general be inadequate to handle even the simplest unstable paths in higher dimensions .",
    "therefore , it is the goal of this paper to exemplify a robust numerical method to solve for the optimal path using a general accurate discrete formulation applied to the hamiltonian two point boundary value problem .",
    "the method we employ here to compute the optimal paths is similar to the generalized minimum action method ( gmam ) , @xcite which is a blend of the string method @xcite and minimum action method @xcite",
    ". both are iterative methods which globally minimize the action along the path .",
    "these other techniques differ from ours primarily in that our formulation of the problem allows a direct , fully explicit iterative scheme , while the gmam , in particular , employs a semi - implicit scheme .",
    "the numerical scheme presented here should provide an easy to employ alternative to the methods discussed above for stochastic optimization problems which are formulated as hamiltonian two - point boundary value problems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first briefly present the general sde problem , and the formulation of the corresponding deterministic hamiltonian system by treating the switching as a rare event .",
    "we then present the details of the numerical approximation technique we will use to find the path which maximize the probability of switching . using this technique , we then demonstrate finding the optimal path from a stable focus to the unstable saddle for the unforced duffing equation , then compute optimal extinction pathways for a simple epidemic model , and finally adapt our method to find optimal transition paths in stochastic delay differential systems .",
    "consider a general stochastic differential equation of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the physical quantity in state space and and the matrix @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 , where the @xmath4 s are general nonlinear functions .",
    "we suppose the noise @xmath5 is a vector having a gaussian distribution with intensity @xmath6 , and independent components .",

    "the above equations can be shown to satisfy the motion of a hamiltonian system with hamiltonian @xmath23 that is , the dynamics of a given path satisfy @xmath24 and @xmath25    in addition to solving the hamiltonian system of dynamics , the full problem specification of an optimal path requires boundary conditions for both state @xmath26 and momenta @xmath27 .",
    "the boundary conditions of the optimal path consist of two steady states , @xmath28 and @xmath29 at equilibrium .",

    "notice , in the case where the hamiltonian is time invariant , and given that the action is minimized along the optimal path , the hamilton - jacobi equations require a zero - energy constraint , i.e. @xmath30 .",

    "we have considered the problem of finding the trajectory in stochastic dynamical systems that optimizes the probability of switching between two states , or causes one or more components to go extinct . in computing such a trajectory , called the optimal path",
    ", we needed to consider a numerical technique which could solve a hamiltonian system with asymptotic boundary conditions in time .",
    "we have developed a numerical method , which we call the iterative action minimizing method ( iamm ) , for finding the optimal path of transition between two steady states in stochastic dynamical systems .",
    "this method is ideal for systems which can be written as two - point boundary value problems governed by hamiltonian systems .",
    "we have validated the iamm by presenting a variety of problems of interest , and have compared the numerical results with either analytic results or monte - carlo simulations of full stochastic systems .    as demonstrated here ,",
    "the iamm method is robust enough to be applicable to a variety of different types of problems , including continuous sde systems , such as the duffing equation , discrete epidemic models of finite population size , such as the sis model , and stochastic delay differential equations , in which the deterministic problem is infinite dimensional .",
    "the methodology is straightforward enough to generalize to higher dimensions , in contrast to other commonly used methods , such as the shooting method , which is a major advantage of the iamm",
    ".    the primary limitations of this method are scaling issues in very high state space dimensions , and the finesse required in picking an initial guess that guarantees convergence , both of which are typical of iterative methods of quasi - newton type . in the limit of small noise or large system size , however , due to the robustness and ease of generalization to complex and high dimensional dynamical systems , the method offers a considerable advantage over simulating large systems , or systems which require many monte carlo runs to generate statistics of the transitions paths . as a result , we expect this method will be useful in efficiently solving a large variety of optimal transition problems in the field of stochastic dynamical systems .",
