    "<S> each electron in the crystal picks up only one of those minima . </S>",

    "<S> reduces the average potential energy , since now the electron never leaves its classical equilibrium location in this direction . </S>",
    "<S> the vibrations along the direction perpendicular to the ring of minima have the same effective mass as in the absence of the spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
