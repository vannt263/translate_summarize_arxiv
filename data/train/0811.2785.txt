    "chaos has two distinctive phenotypes : sensitive dependence on initial data , and recurrence .",
    "sensitive dependence on initial data means that no matter how small the initial condition changes , after sufficiently long time , the change will reach order one .",
    "this phenotype can also be observed in non - chaotic systems , for example , in an explosive system .",
    "together with the second phenotype , it can often identify chaos .",
    "recurrence means that the orbit repeatedly re - visits the neighborhood of its initial point .",
    "sensitive dependence on initial data can often be proved in a neighborhood of a homoclinic orbit or a heteroclinic cycle . the best technique for accomplishing",
    "this is the so - called shadowing lemma @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", recurrence can often be established from general measure - theoretic arguments .",
    "there are several good prototypes for understanding chaos in fluids : 2d navier - stokes equations under periodic boundary conditions and periodic forcing in both space and time , the couette flow , the poiseuille flow , and the plane poiseuille flow , to name a few .",
    "when the so - called reynolds number is large enough , all these flows develop chaos .",
    "when the reynolds number just crosses its threshold , the chaos is often transient ( that is , it has a finite life time ) . with the increase of the reynolds number ,",
    "the life time of chaos increases too .",
    "transient chaos is very poorly understood even for ordinary differential equations .",
    "the rigorously proved chaos is always eternal .",
    "sometimes , one can observe intermittent chaos in fluids , that is , the chaos state and the regular state repeatedly exchange in time to eternity .    in order to identify the chaos phenotypes in fluids",
    ", one can try to prove a recurrence theorem for euler equations @xcite @xcite , and establish the existence of a heteroclinic cycle @xcite . as a chaos phenotype ,",
    "the recurrence theorem proved in @xcite is quite satisfactory , while the heteroclinic cycle search in @xcite is still at a conjecture stage .",
    "another relevant topic to the dynamical system study of fluids is invariant manifold .",
    "it turns out that an unstable manifold can be proved for 2d navier - stokes equations , while invariant manifolds for euler equations are a tough open problem @xcite .",
    "all these studies were conducted on the simplest prototype  2d navier - stokes equations under periodic boundary conditions . for other prototypes mentioned above , very little is understood about chaos .",
    "their analytical studies were often focused upon linear instability .",
    "there is a famous sommerfeld paradox saying that couette flow is linearly stable for all reynolds numbers as first calculated by sommerfeld @xcite , but experiments show that couette flow is unstable when the reynolds number is large enough .",
    "this paradox lies at the heart of understanding turbulence inside the infinite dimensional phase space .",
    "an analytical study on the paradox is conducted in @xcite .",
    "another study was given in @xcite .",
    "a complete resolution of the paradox will require a complete understanding of the dynamics at least in a certain region of the infinite dimensional phase space .",
    "on the other hand , investigating the paradox may lead the way and have significant impact in the studies of fluid dynamics in phase spaces .",
    "recently , there has been a renaissance in numerical dynamical system studies on the paradox @xcite",

    "new non - wandering solutions ( fixed points , periodic orbits , and relative periodic orbits ) are discovered .",
    "better estimates on the critical reynolds number and perturbation threshold are obtained .",
    "it seems that pipe poiseuille flow , plane couette flow , and plane poiseuille flow share some universal coherent structure of `` streak , roll , and critical layer '' .",
    "the coherent structure seems quite robust in the sense that they survive for increasing reynolds number .",
    "there seems to be also good agreement with experiments @xcite . in the infinite reynolds number limit",
    ", the `` streak '' part of the fixed points tends to a limit shear ( one of the infinitely many shear fixed points of 3d euler equations ) ; and the `` roll '' and `` critical layer '' disappear @xcite @xcite .",
    "the limit shear is characterized by a condition @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we shall focus on recurrence . in sections 3 - 7",
    ", we shall discuss the issues related to sensitive dependence on initial data , especially the heteroclinics conjecture , linear spectra and their zero - viscosity limits , and the melnikov integral . in section 8",
    ", we shall briefly discuss the sommerfeld paradox .",
    "section 9 is a discussion on future directions and open problems .",
    "the classical poincar recurrence theorem can be stated as follows :    let ( @xmath0 ) be a finite measure space and @xmath1 be a measure - preserving transformation . for any @xmath2 ( @xmath3-algebra of subsets of @xmath4 ) , the measure @xmath5 that is , almost every point returns infinitely often .",
    "the geometric intuition of the poincar recurrence theorem is that in a finite measure space ( or invariant subset ) , the images of a positive measure set under a measure - preserving map will have no room left but intersect the original set repeatedly .",
    "the measure of the space @xmath4 being finite is crucial .",
    "for example , consider the two - dimensional hamiltonian system of the pendulum @xmath6 its phase plane diagram is shown in figure [ ppd ] .",
    "if the invariant region includes orbits outside the cat s eyes , then the measure of the region will not be finite , and the poincar recurrence theorem will not hold .",
    "one can see clearly that the orbits outside the cat s eyes will drift to infinity .",
    "the investigation of recurrence of fluid dynamics in an infinite dimensional phase space encounters a serious problem that natural finite dimensional measures ( e.g. gibbs measure ) do not have good counterparts in infinite dimensions .",
    "it is well - known that the kinetic energy and enstrophy are invariant under the 2d euler flow .",
    "but it is difficult to use them to define finite measures in infinite dimensions .",
    "it seems possible to study the poincar recurrence problem directly from banach norms rather than measures . along this direction ,",
    "the concept of measure - preserving transformation , which is so critical in finite dimensions , is not necessary anymore .",
    "consider the 2d euler equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the velocity of the fluid , and @xmath9 is the pressure .",
    "the boundary conditions are crucial in determining the structure of the dynamics in the phase space .",
    "the simplest boundary condition is the periodic boundary condition , that is , topologically the fluid motion is confined on the 2-torus @xmath10 .",
    "under such a boundary condition , certain recurrence can be established as discussed below @xcite .",
    "the 2d euler equation is globally well - posed in @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we also require that @xmath13 the theorem stated below says that any @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) solution to the 2d euler equation returns repeatedly to an arbitrarily small @xmath14 neighborhood .",
    "@xcite for any @xmath15 ( @xmath12 ) , any @xmath16 , and any @xmath17 ; there is a @xmath18 such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an infinite sequence of positive integers , and @xmath21 is the evolution operator of the 2d euler equation . [ tr ]    periodic boundary condition makes fluid dynamics a more natural dynamical system .",
    "the hope is that certain conclusions derived from the periodic boundary condition may be universal among all boundary conditions , or at least in the region away from boundaries .",
    "of course , there are always special properties that are unique to the specific boundary conditions , for example , the example in @xcite @xcite of non - return near initial point is mainly due to the special slip boundary conditions on the boundaries of an annulus .",
    "2d euler equation is an infinite dimensional hamiltonian system @xcite . under periodic boundary condition",
    ", its hamiltonian structure can be written in terms of fourier series @xcite . in a hamiltonian system , heteroclinics often comes from the so - called separatrix .",
    "such a separatrix represents the instability in the hamiltonian system .",
    "the general scenario of chaos generation is that when the hamiltonian system is under proper perturbations , chaos is created near the separatrix .",
    "proper perturbations often represent a good balance between energy dissipation and energy input . for instances , going from 2d euler equation to 2d navier - stokes equation",
    ", proper perturbations can be obtained by proper external forcings , e.g. spatially and temporally periodic forcing @xcite .    for the heteroclinics search ,",
    "it is more convenient to write the 2d euler equation in the vorticity form , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vorticity which is a real scalar - valued function of three variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the bracket @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the stream function given by , @xmath29 the relation between vorticity @xmath23 and stream function @xmath28 is , @xmath30 we pose the periodic boundary condition @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a positive constant , i.e. the 2d euler equation is defined on the 2-torus @xmath10 .",
    "we propose the following conjecture @xcite .    * the heteroclinics conjecture : in the sobolev space @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , for any fixed point @xmath23 of the 2d euler flow having an unstable eigenvalue , there is a pair of heteroclinic cycles asymptotic to the two fixed points @xmath23 and @xmath35 .",
    "the nature of `` a pair of heteroclinic cycles '' is motivated from the following symmetries :    1 .",

    "the first symmetry allows us to work in an invariant subspace in which all the @xmath42 s are real - valued .",
    "this corresponds to the cosine transform in ( [ fs ] ) .",
    "take @xmath43 as an example , the second symmetry maps the unstable manifold ( assuming its existence ) of the fixed point @xmath44 into the stable manifold ( assuming its existence ) of @xmath45 .",
    "the third symmetry maps the unstable manifold of @xmath44 into the unstable manifold of @xmath45 . by choosing @xmath46 , the fourth symmetry maps the unstable manifold of @xmath44 into the unstable manifold of @xmath45 . to maintain the cosine transform ,",

    "in fact , both may lie on certain sphere in the phase space due to the constraint by the invariants .",

    "together they form a pair of heteroclinic cycles .",

    "this leads to the existence of an unstable eigenvalue of the corresponding viscous orr - sommerfeld operator , when the reynolds number @xmath185 is sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "notice that these oscillatory shears are not fixed points anymore under the navier - stokes dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , they only drift very slowly .",
    "the important fact is that here the unstable eigenvalue of the orr - sommerfeld operator is order @xmath193 with respect to @xmath79 as @xmath111 .",
    "intuitively , this fact should lead to relatively long finite time nonlinear growth near the oscillatory shears ( and the couette shear ) .",
    "such a growth will manifest itself in experiments as transient turbulence . here",
    "the amplitude of the perturbation from the couette shear will be measured by the deviation of the oscillatory shears from the couette shear and the perturbation on top of the oscillatory shears .",
    "in terms of analytical studies on chaos in fluids , the promising future direction will be the periodic boundary condition model where analysis can benefit from fourier analysis .",
    "the heteroclinics conjecture is a challenging open problem on top of the open problem on the existence of invariant manifolds for 2d euler equation . on the other hand , galerkin truncations and numerical simulations all",
    "indicate that such a heteroclinics should exist .",
    "the current numerical capability is still limited in dealing such simulations .",
    "of course , future improvement of numerical capability is always a hope .",
    "the question of how useful melnikov integrals can be for predicting chaos in fluids , is still unclear . once again , the first obstacle is the open problem on the existence of invariant manifolds for 2d euler equation .",
    "2d euler equation may not have any invariant manifold at all . in principle ,",
    "melnikov integrals serve as good predicting tools for chaos only when the phase space structures are very special in the sense that the melnikov prediction on the intersection of certain center - unstable and center - stable manifolds leads to the existence of certain homoclinics or heteroclinics . here for the 2d navier - stokes equation , the phase space structures are not clear at all , for example , what are the fixed points or limit cycles ?",
    "how close they are from the simple fixed point we are studying ?    the phase space structures of couette flow , poiseuille flow , and plane poiseuille flow etc",
    ". also drew a lot of attentions recently .",
    "most of the works are numerical .",
    "due to the limitation of the numerical capability , analytical results are very precious .",
    "analytically , the norms of the phase space play a fundamental role which is often missing from numerical simulations",
    ". it may be possible to have a better picture of a small region in the phase space by feedback studies between analysis and numerics .",
    "it may also be possible to prove the existence of certain nontrivial fixed points or limit cycles .",
    "in finite dimensional dissipative systems , chaos is often associated with certain homoclinics or heteroclinics .",
    "it is not clear whether or not this is still true for fluid flows with boundary layers .",
