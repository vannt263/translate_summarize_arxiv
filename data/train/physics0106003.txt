    "the evolution of charged particle beams in accelerators and storage rings can often be described by the vlasov - maxwell equations . at high energies",
    "the discrete - particle collision term @xcite comprises a small correction to the dynamics and can be neglected .",
    "radiation effects at sufficiently high energies for leptons can be a significant feature of the dynamics , and should be included in the model under consideration .",
    "the vlasov - maxwell equations constitute a considerable simplification in the description of charged particle beam propagation .",
    "nonetheless there are only a few cases that are tractable analytically .",
    "therefore , it is of utmost the importance to develop a systematic perturbation approach , able to provide satisfactory results in a wide variety of cases of physical interest .",
    "particle beams are subject to external forces that are often rapidly oscillating , such as quadrupolar focusing forces , rf fields , etc .",
    "in addition , the collective self - field excitations can be rapidly oscillating as well .",
    "a typical example is a colliding - beam storage ring device , where the evolution of each beam is strongly affected by the electromagnetic force produced by the counter - propagating beam .",
    "the beam - beam kick each beam experiences is localized only in a small region around the interaction point , and is periodic with a period of one turn .    in this and other important cases",
    "one is primarily interested in the long - time behavior of the beam , thus discarding the fast processes on time scales of order the period of the rapid oscillations . to extract the relevant information , an efficient method of averaging is developed in the next section . unlike the standard canonical perturbation technique @xcite , the approach used here is carried out in a `` mixed '' phase space ( old coordinates and new canonical momenta ) , which is simpler and more efficient in a computational sense .",
    "the canonical perturbation method devel-    oped here is further applied to the coherent beam - beam interaction , and a coupled set of nonlinear integral equations for the equilibrium beam densities has been derived .",
