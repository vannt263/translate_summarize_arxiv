    "consider an arbitrary ( possibly highly inhomogeneous ) material that is known to be in static stress equilibrium . for present purposes , the material is taken to be two - dimensional and the following lattice representation of the stress field is defined .",

    "the couple is necessary to represent the torque that can be applied to a cell even in the absence of tangential forces , due to the manner in which the normal force is distributed along the edge .",
    "the couple is here defined so that it does _ not _ include the contribution of the tangential force to the torque .",

    "we will drop the superscript whenever this leads to no ambiguity .",
    "both @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to the amplitude of the net compressive force between the cells sharing an edge  negative values would indicate a net tensile force between them .",
    "the sign convention for tangential forces is chosen such that positive @xmath24 or @xmath25 always indicates a positive downward component of the force exerted _ by _ the cell with a higher center _ on _ the lower one .",
    "the sign convention for the couples is that the directions indicated in figure  [ fig : amodel]b correspond to positive values of each of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 s .",
    "this choice allows the right - left symmetry of the model to be immediately evident in the equations below .",

    "these forces and couples can be written as integrals over their respective edges .",

    "the lattice and variables just described , together with the fundamental physical force and torque balance constraints , constitute the @xmath1-lattice .",
    "a `` configuration '' of the lattice denotes a set of values of @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for all @xmath4 that satisfies eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vforcebalance ] ) , ( [ eq : hforcebalance ] ) , and ( [ eq : torquebalance ] ) for every @xmath4 .",
    "each configuration is a discrete representation of a possible stress field , and any possible stress field induces a configuration .",
    "thus the @xmath1-lattice  structure may be a useful tool for investigating stresses in a wide range of inhomogeneous materials .",
    "we now turn to the modeling of non - cohesive granular materials on the @xmath1-lattice . in the spirit of the @xmath0-model",
    "it is assumed that a typical stress distribution can be obtained by propagating the forces from top to bottom on the lattice .",
    "this assumption is made for the sole purpose of allowing the rapid construction of plausible force configurations . in the @xmath2-model ,",
    "configurations are generated by descending through the lattice , solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vforcebalancea])-([eq : torquebalancea2 ] ) for each cell .",
    "the process begins by specifying values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 for each cell and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for the cells in the top layer .",
    "given the values of the uppercase variables at a particular cell , the six lowercase variables must be determined . since these variables are constrained by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vforcebalance ] ) ,  ( [ eq : hforcebalance ] ) , and  ( [ eq : torquebalance ] ) , the space of possible solutions is then three dimensional and can be parameterized by three real numbers @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the manner in which these three numbers are determined at each cell must reflect the physics of the material being modeled .",
    "it is convenient to make the definitions @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "the force and torque balance equations for a single cell can then be written as @xmath70 where the torque equation has been split into two so that it may be expressed in a symmetric form .",
    "if @xmath56 and @xmath57 are given for every cell , then the microscopic true stress field induces a unique configuration of triples @xmath71 on the lattice .    in a non - cohesive granular material consisting of convex grains ,",
    "the grains can `` push '' on each other , but never `` pull '' ; i.e. , there can be no tensile forces in the material on scales larger than the grain size .",
    "this feature is incorporated into the @xmath2-model  by imposing two restrictions :    1 .",
    "all normal force amplitudes @xmath72 and",
    "@xmath73 must be positive ; 2 .",
    "all @xmath65 s and @xmath66 s must lie in the interval @xmath74 .",
    "both restrictions are consequences of the assumption that there are no tensile forces anywhere along the cell edge .",
    "the maximal couple that can be produced by a given normal force amplitude corresponds to the case in which the entire normal force is applied at one corner of the cell , in which case @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) is @xmath75 .",
    "the assumption is not rigorously valid since there can be tensile forces in the interior of a grain that is cut by the edge of a cell .",
    "the central hypothesis of the @xmath2-model , however , is that the geometric randomness in the grain positions can be replaced by the randomness in the choice of the solution for each cell . in this context ,",
    "restrictions 1 and 2 are valid as long as the cell size is larger than or equal to the grain size .",
    "it is duly noted that the method of propagating forces down from the top of the system does not faithfully represent the physics in the following sense .",
    "the equations of stress equilibrium are elliptic equations whose solutions depend on the boundary conditions on all of the system s boundaries . for the propagation method employed in the @xmath2-model ,",
    "the only cells that can be affected by a change in the distribution of forces on a given cell are the ones that lie in a downward opening cone with @xmath76 edges , and in this respect the model is more appropriate to a hyperbolic system .",
    "the goal here , however , is to construct the simplest model consistent with the relevant stress balance constraints and capable of displaying nontrivial fluctuations .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the classical approach to the computation of stresses via mohr - coulomb constitutive relations also transforms the problem into a hyperbolic one , and the computational method of propagating stresses downward from the top is routinely exploited in this context as well .",
    "@xcite the development of rigorous elliptic methods for generating consistent configurations is an interesting and potentially important problem as well , but is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the adoption of a hyperbolic method necessarily leads to a third restriction on the force amplitudes :    all tangential force amplitudes must be positive .    in the absence of this restriction",
    "it is impossible to ensure that restriction 1 above can be met for every cell .",
    "that is , if negative tangential amplitudes are permitted to occur , then it can happen that for some cell deeper in the system all solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vforcebalance ] ) ,  ( [ eq : hforcebalance ] ) , and  ( [ eq : torquebalance ] ) have a negative value of either @xmath72 or @xmath73 . on the other hand , it can be shown , using the method described in the following subsection ,",
    "that restriction 3 guarantees a consistent solution for every cell .",
    "the final assumption defining the @xmath2-model  is that geometric randomness in the structure of a granular material can be effectively modeled by assigning equal probability to all possible solutions to the force and torque balance equations at each cell .",
    "this requires defining a particular measure on the space of solutions . in the absence of any good reason to choose otherwise",
    ", it will be assumed that all values of the triple @xmath71 that are consistent with restrictions 1 - 3 above are equally probable .",
    "_ throughout the rest of this paper it will also be assumed , for simplicity , that all cells have the same @xmath56 and that @xmath77 for every cell .",
    "_    this concludes the definition of the 2d @xmath2-model  for non - cohesive granular materials consisting of convex grains .",
    "the next subsection presents a geometric picture of the solution space of the force and torque balance equations for a single cell .",
    "the picture provides useful insight into the need for restriction 3 and also reveals that the cell size in the model must be interpreted as the grain size .",
    "the @xmath0-model  may be thought of as a rather drastic simplification of the @xmath2-model  in which eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hforcebalance ] ) and  ( [ eq : torquebalance ] ) are ignored .",
    "the horizontal components of the forces can then be neglected and it becomes more convenient to work with variable @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "( [ eq : hforcebalance ] ) can then be written as @xmath80 in the @xmath0-model , @xmath0 at each site is an independent random number chosen from some distribution with support only on the interval @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "the lack of correlation between @xmath0 s at different sites is an important feature in the asymptotic analysis of coppersmith et al.@xcite note that the @xmath2-model  differs from the @xmath0-model  in that the random variables at each cell can not be chosen in advance , but only after the forces have been propagated down to the cell . if all of the @xmath82 are fixed in advance , negative tangential and normal forces are quickly generated and the amplitudes diverge rapidly with increasing depth .",
    "thus the `` maximally random '' @xmath2-model  does contain correlations that are direct consequences of the additional force and torque balance constraints . in this sense",
    "it is related to attempts to derive force distributions by maximizing a statistical entropy associated with the possible ways of constructing microscopic configurations consistent with an imposed average stress field @xcite , but differs in that the average stress field in the @xmath2-model  is not given in advance .      for the purposes of this subsection we will take @xmath83 .",
    "the effects of gravity can be included in a straightforward manner once the graphical method is understood .",
    "all of the information contained in the values of @xmath22 , @xmath84 , and @xmath24 on one edge can be encoded in a single vector placed at some position along the edge .",
    "the vector itself represents the sum of the normal and tangential forces and the position is chosen such that the torque that would be produced about the center of the cell by the normal component of the force is equal to @xmath84 .",
    "thus the net effect of any configuration of stresses in the cell can be expressed graphically by drawing the four vectors , one on each edge .",
    "now given the vectors on the upper edges of a cell we would like to determine all the possible ways of assigning vectors to the lower edges .",
    "one solution is immediately obvious and will be called the `` direct solution '' .",
    "simply construct rays originating from the vectors on each edge , then take the lower vectors to be equal and opposite to the upper vectors and positioned where their respective rays intersect a lower edge .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : directsolution ] . )",
    "each ray will be called a `` ray of force '' , though it is understood that the stresses represented are not really concentrated on the ray .",
    "the only complication that can arise is that both rays of force intersect the same lower edge . in this case ,",
    "the vector assigned to this edge is the sum of the two , positioned such that the couple associated with it is the sum of the couples associated with the two .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : directsolution ] . )",
    "note that the direct solution is guaranteed to exist if and only if each ray of force is guaranteed to intersect a lower edge , rather than exiting the cell through the other upper edge .",
    "this will be true whenever the normal and tangential amplitudes on the upper edge are both positive and is directly related to restriction 3 above .    to construct solutions different from the direct solution , note that force and torque balance can be preserved by having a ray of force split into two rays at some arbitrary point in the cell , as shown in figure  [ fig : forcerays]a .",
    "the force associated with each ray is directed along the ray and the force amplitudes are then fixed by requiring that the three forces sum to zero .",
    "torque balance is guaranteed because none of the three forces generates any torque about the splitting point .",
    "similarly , two rays of force that intersect can be merged into a single ray of force emanating from the point of intersection .",
    "whenever all three rays of force intersecting at a single point lie in the same half - plane , the force amplitude associated with one of them must be negative .",
    "this situation is depicted in figure  [ fig : forcerays]b .",
    "the thin line in the figure indicates a negative amplitude .",
    "any solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vforcebalance])-([eq : torquebalance ] ) can be depicted as a network of force rays within the cell .",
    "an example involving a negative amplitude is shown in figure  [ fig : forcerays]c .",
    "it is possible for negative amplitudes to be an artifact of the summing of two forces that occur at different positions on the same edge , as would arise for the configuration shown in figure  [ fig : directsolution]c .",
    "there exist configurations , however , for which the negative amplitude can only be interpreted as corresponding to a real tensile force .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : forcerays]c .",
    "the forces applied to the upper edges of the cell result in _ no _ force being transmitted across edge @xmath85 .",
    "the force transmitted across edge @xmath86 balances both the forces and net torque produces by the forces above .",
    "there is no way to produce the configuration shown in a material that does not support tensile forces . to see this ,",
    "consider the description of the configuration using cells of smaller scale ( the dashed cells in figure  [ fig : forcerays]c .",
    "it can be shown that it is impossible to construct a network of force rays on the smaller cells that would be represented by the network shown on the large cell , without having tensile segments that cross the boundaries of some of the small cells .",
    "( the situation corresponds to that of a horizontal beam clamped at one end and supporting a load on the other , in which case the top portion of the beam is under tension . )",
    "thus if all possible solutions of the force and torque balance equations occur with equal probability , the material within a cell must be assumed to support tensile forces and hence must be on the order of or smaller than the grain size .",
    "together with the reasoning leading to restriction 1 , this leads to the conclusion that _ the cell size in the @xmath2-model  must be the grain size . _    in practice , the region in @xmath2-space which yields solutions that satisfy restrictions 1 - 3 is not easily identified .",
    "restriction 2 immediately implies that @xmath65 and @xmath66 must lie in the range @xmath74 . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vforcebalancea])-([eq : torquebalancea2 ] ) and the restrictions 1 - 3 , it can also be shown that @xmath64 must lie in the range @xmath87 thus the entire region of consistent solutions must be contained within a rectangular region in @xmath2-space . to give equal weight to every solution consistent with the restrictions , a point is selected at",
    "random according to a uniform probability density throughout the rectangular box .",
    "the values of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 are then computed from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vforcebalancea])-([eq : torquebalancea2 ] ) . if any of these quantities is negative , the solution is discarded and the process is repeated until a consistent solution is found . since every point within the rectangular box has an equal probability of being chosen on every attempt , it follows that every point that corresponds to a consistent solution has an equal probability of being selected .    in some cases",
    ", it may turn out that the set of consistent solutions occupies a very small region of the rectangular box so that the probability of finding a solution by random guessing is prohibitively small .",
    "the results described in this paper were obtained by imposing a cutoff @xmath90 on the number of unsuccessful guesses . if the cutoff was reached for a particular cell , the direct solution for that cell was used .",
    "a final issue that must be addressed is how the gravitational force is to be distributed in the direct solution .",
    "some care must be taken here to avoid generating more and more cells for which the direct solution must be used .",
    "the choice made for the simulations described in this paper is that the contributions due to the weight of the cell are @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are each random numbers between 0.1 and 0.5 , and @xmath94 . with this choice",
    ", the portion of the weight transmitted to the right ( or left ) increases when the cell is being pushed to the right ( or left ) from above .",
    "this is meant only to be plausible .",
    "it enters the computation of the stresses only when the direct solution is used , which can be made as infrequent as desired by raising the value of the cutoff @xmath90 .",
    "the two sections below discuss the configurations generated under different sets of boundary conditions . in section",
    "[ sec : silo ] , the focus is on the average stresses in a deep , narrow silo geometry , where walls can ( and do ) support stresses .",
    "the model then assumes the geometry shown in figure  [ fig : amodel]a with the shaded cells assumed to absorb all forces applied from above .",
    "the force and couple amplitudes on the dashed edges are taken to vanish identically . while there is no attempt to model the elasticity of the walls in a realistic way , significant differences between the @xmath2-model  and the @xmath0-model  will arise , leading to some useful insights .    in section  [ sec : deepbox ] , the goal is to explore the asymptotic behavior of the stresses in an infinitely wide and deep system .",
    "for this purpose periodic boundary conditions are employed in the horizontal direction .",
    "the two shaded cells in a layer in figure  [ fig : amodel]a are identified and all cells are treated equivalently . the width of the system is always taken large enough so that the maximal force observed on any cell is small compared to the total force on its layer .",
    "one classical approach to the computation of stresses in a granular material to assume that the material satisfies the mohr - coulomb criterion everywhere in space . denoting",
    "the principal stresses as @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the mohr - coulomb criterion in 2d reads @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the internal friction angle characteristic of the material .",
    "a typical assumption for the boundary condition at the walls is @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a parameter characterizing the friction between the material and the wall .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the stress equilibrium equations can be solved numerically .",
    "@xcite the centerline stress @xmath101 at depth @xmath47 is well fit by the solution of janssen ( which relies on additional simplifying assumptions ) @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "the janssen solution assumes that @xmath101 is independent of horizontal position , which does not turn out to be true in the full solution .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the deviations , which are of the order of 15% from wall to centerline , do not alter the fundamental result that @xmath104 is a function of @xmath105 only .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath0-model  in this geometry is quite different .",
    "an ensemble average of configurations generated by the @xmath0-model   yields a parabolic profile for the vertical forces supported . at large depths a steady state is attained in which the vertical stress near the wall must be proportional to the radius @xmath106 of the silo , since the vertical force transmitted to the walls at each layer must equal the weight of the layer on average .",
    "the stress at the centerline , on the other hand , is proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "this behavior is accurately reproduced by an analytic calculation of the distribution of forces in the @xmath0-model  when all @xmath0 s are assigned their mean value of @xmath108 .",
    "the analytic solution also indicates that the approach to the asymptotic profile occurs more slowly , with a decay constant of the order of @xmath109 rather than @xmath110 .",
    "@xcite    experimental results appear to confirm the scaling expectations of the classical analysis .",
    "the recent experiments of clment et al .",
    ", for example , show a linear scaling with system width in both the asymptotic average vertical stress and the characteristic depth of the approach to the asymptotic value .",

    "( see text for specification of parameters . )",
    "the thick dashed line is a fit to the janssen solution , with one free parameter chosen to match the asymptotic value of the force at large depths .",
    "the thin line shows the behavior of the @xmath0-model  with a uniform distribution of @xmath0s.,width=288 ]    figure  [ fig : silo ] shows data for three different silo widths , plotted in terms of the scaled variables suggested by the classical analysis .",

    "each data point in figure  [ fig : silo ] was obtained by averaging @xmath111 over 1000 configurations . in all cases ,",
    "the cutoff @xmath90 was taken to be 1000 , resulting in the direct solution being used for approximately 3% of the cells .",

    "the same value of @xmath120 was used for all data sets and the @xmath112 was taken to be the average number of cells in two successive layers , not including the wall cells .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that data from an experiment by clment et al .",
    "show the same tendency to lie above the janssen curve at small depths .",
    "@xcite the solid line in figure  [ fig : silo ] is the prediction from the simplest version of the @xmath0-model , in which the distribution of @xmath0 s is taken to be uniform over the unit interval , shown here for @xmath121 .",

    "it is clear that the inclusion of the proper force and torque balance constraints brings the @xmath2-model  into much closer agreement with conventional expectations than the @xmath0-model .",
    "the reason for this appears to be that in the @xmath2-model  strong stresses tend to propagate to the left or right with increasing depth , whereas in the @xmath0-model  the vertical force simply diffuses .",

    "it is also worth noting that the @xmath2-model  exhibits well - formed arches on the `` microscopic '' level , an effect which will be illustrated more clearly below .",
    "in addition , the filamentary stress chains observed in the @xmath2-modelare roughly reminiscent of experimental images produced under a variety of conditions ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and also with numerical solutions of stresses in random disk packings @xcite .",
    "though quantitative comparison with these experiments and models is beyond the scope of this work , it does appear that the model is capable of displaying plausible behavior both at the microscopic and macroscopic levels .",
    "finally , it is instructive to consider the @xmath2-model  in the absence of any randomness . if @xmath92 and @xmath93 are set to 0.5 and the direct solution is employed for every cell , the model generates a smooth stress field in which the walls support almost no weight and the vertical force grows linearly with depth .",
    "this may be thought of as the correct result for a homogeneous solid with a vanishing poisson ratio .",
    "the vertical stress generates no horizontal force on the walls , which therefore can not bear any weight . allowing @xmath92 and @xmath93 to vary between 0.1 and 0.5 but still employing",
    "the direct solution for every cell causes the walls to bear only a small fraction of the weight of each layer .",
    "this shows that the behavior illustrated in figure  [ fig : silo ] results directly from the randomness in the choice of solutions , not from the structure of the @xmath1-lattice  and the `` hyperbolic '' method alone .",
    "no constitutive relation similar or even analogous to the mohr - coulomb condition of incipient yield has been put into the model , which makes the fact that the results agree reasonably well with the classical theory quite intriguing .",
    "one of the primary motivations for developing the @xmath2-model  is to see whether the predictions of the @xmath0-model  survive the inclusion of physically realistic force and torque balance constraints .",
    "three questions are of particular importance :    1 .",
    "does the probability distribution for stresses in an infinitely wide system approach a stationary limit at large depths ? 2 .",
    "if so , does the limiting probability distribution have the same form as that of the @xmath0-model ? 3 .",
    "do the constraints induce any long range spatial correlations in the stresses ?    as a first step in answering these questions , distributions of the vertical forces were computed for a system of width 500 at depths up to 450 .",
