    "among the many discoveries made by the _ kepler _ mission @xcite is the ubiquitous nature of exoplanets with masses and radii in between those of the earth and neptune . despite their absence from the solar system , planets smaller than neptune , but larger than the solar system s terrestrial planets , are surprisingly common in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "several subdivisions of this regime have been created ( e.g. , super - earths , mini - neptunes ) , but there may exist a continuum of planets in this portion of parameter space , blurring the line that previously separated rocky terrestrial and gaseous giant planets .",
    "an interesting member of this class of exoplanets is _ kepler_-445c .",
    "_ kepler_-445c was first identified as a planet candidate by @xcite and was later confirmed and characterized by @xcite . it was reported to be a 2.5@xmath2 planet orbiting a cool , metal - rich m4 dwarf star @xmath3 pc away with an orbital period of 4.87 days @xcite .",
    "the properties of _ kepler_-445c and its host star are similar to the gj 1214 system , which is one of the most extensively studied exoplanet systems to date .",
    "_ kepler_-445 has a _ kepler _ magnitude of 17.475 , making it a relatively faint exoplanet host .",
    "this magnitude is slightly above the completeness limit of the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and results in relatively low - precision light curves compared to the majority of _ kepler _ targets .",
    "detailed atmospheric investigations have occurred for a handful of exoplanets intermediate in size between the earth and neptune ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the vast majority , including _",
    "kepler_-445c , have been classified by their planetary radii inferred from _ kepler _ transit observations .",
    "the light curves returned by _ kepler _ comprise an invaluable contribution to our understanding of planetary systems , but their analysis is complex and requires a careful assessment of many potential sources of error .",
    "the _ kepler _ science operations center ( soc ) pipeline that converts the raw pixel - level data to the simple aperture photometry ( sap ) light curves or pre - search data conditioning ( pdcsap ) light curves has been thoroughly documented @xcite .",
    "the pdcsap light curves undergo extensive artifact mitigation and are well suited for the characterization of transiting exoplanets .    because each pixel on the _ kepler _ detectors covers a 4@xmath4x4@xmath4 patch of sky and the target apertures typically consist of several pixels , a critical step in the pre - search data conditioning is the correction for crowding , or flux contamination , from sources other than the target star .",
    "indeed , adaptive optics imaging of 3313 _ kepler _ planet candidate hosts suggests that 14.5@xmath50.8% have a nearby star within 015 to 40 @xcite .",
    "the susceptibility of the _ kepler _ data to this source of contamination is well known , and several recent studies have discussed transit dilution by unresolved companion stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    correcting for crowding requires accurate positions and magnitudes of all the sources in _",
    "kepler s _ field - of - view . in most versions of the soc pipeline ,",
    "this information comes from the kic .",
    "the crowding correction also requires the expected pixel response functions ( prfs ) of the detectors over which the fluxes of the stars will be spread @xcite . as all of this",
    "information from various modules of the pipeline is combined , the chance of an error entering and propagating through the process increases .",
    "for this reason , many efforts have to been made to remove spurious detections in the _ kepler _ light curves : @xcite introduced the blender technique to search for blended foreground or background eclipsing binaries diluted by the target , @xcite developed an automated transit candidate validation procedure by calculating false positive probabilities , and @xcite created a method of identifying false transit signals that were misclassified as small long - period planet candidates .    here",
    "we investigate how a suspicious source in the kic caused an erroneous crowding correction in the pdcsap light curves of _ kepler_-445 . as a result ,",
    "the transit depths and planetary radii inferred from the _ kepler _ data for the exoplanets in this system were overestimated .",
    "this investigation was motivated by ground - based observations of several transits of _ kepler_-445c that were obtained with the discovery channel telescope ( dct ) , which are described in section [ sec : obs ] . in section [ sec : analysis ] , we describe the analysis of the dct observations that produced high - precision transit light curves with scatter of 0.17% ( 0.0018 mags ) in the best case .",
    "the repeatable high - precision , time - series photometry from the dct makes it a valuable tool to be used by the exoplanet community . in section [ sec : analysis ] , we also outline the bayesian parameter estimation technique that yielded transit parameters which were in contention with the previous _ kepler _ results . in section [ sec : results ] , we postulate that an improbable series of events tracing back to the usno - b1 stellar catalog led to the original mischaracterization of _ kepler_-445c",
    ". finally , in section [ sec : discussion ] , we consider the physical radii of all three planets in the _ kepler_-445 system and the potential for additional phantom stars to affect other _ kepler _ targets .",
    "this work offers a cautionary tale for the analysis of data from future exoplanet transit surveys including the transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( tess , * ? ? ?",
    "we observed three transits of _ kepler_-445c with the large monolithic imager ( lmi ; * ? ? ? * ) on the 4.3-meter discovery channel telescope ( dct ) located at lowell observatory in happy jack , arizona .",

    "the readout time for the entire chip with 1x1 binning on a single amplifier is @xmath073 seconds .",
    "since our exposure times were always less than or equal to 30 seconds , we chose to increase efficiency by reading the chip with all four amplifiers and 2x2 binning .",
    "this decreased the overhead time in between exposures to @xmath08.5 seconds .",
    "the effective pixel scale was 024 pixel@xmath7 with 2x2 binning .",
    "we employed a custom data reduction and analysis pipeline that has previously been applied to high - precision , time - series photometry from the dct - lmi @xcite .",
    "the calibration consisted of a bias and over scan subtraction and a flat - field correction .",
    "the minimal dark current present in the observations ( estimated to be 0.07 electrons pixel@xmath7 hour@xmath7 ) was removed through the background subtraction described below .    in some cases , we applied an additional correction for fringing . although the lmi s deep depletion ccd suppressed fringing at long wavelengths , the sloan z-band images still displayed low - level fringe patterns with typical variability of less than 1% .",
    "the patterns were large and were difficult to detect in small portions of the full image ( fig .",

    "we removed the fringing using a fringe frame constructed previously under a separate dct program ( p.i .",

    "each image was dithered by at least 15@xmath4 to assure that sources fell on different pixels and would not appear in the final fringe frame .",

    "the scaled fringe frame was then subtracted from the science frame to remove the fringing .",
    "we conducted differential aperture photometry on _ kepler_-445 using background stars in the 12@xmath83x12@xmath83 field - of - view of the dct - lmi .",
    "the field was crowded , so we selected calibration stars based on the following criteria .",
    "first , the outer edge of sky annulus of the star could not be within 100 pixels of the edge of the frame .",
    "second , the star s sky annulus could not overlap the photometric aperture of any other source in the image .",

    "lastly , the star s photometric aperture could not contain a cosmetic defect ( e.g. , dead pixels ) .",
    "these criteria yielded hundreds of potential calibration stars .",

    "we summed the flux from _ kepler_-445 and the calibration stars in the photometric apertures and used the sky annuli to account for any residual local background signal , including any dark current . in the sky",
    "annuli , bad pixels , hot pixels , cosmic ray strikes , and any other spurious signals at a level of 5@xmath1 above or below the median count value were masked .",

    "regardless of the origin of the inconsistency , the transit depths estimated from the three dct - lmi observations described here were likely not precise enough to distinguish between various atmospheric compositions for _ kepler_-445c .",
    "continuing under the assumption that the variation in transit depths between filters was not astrophysical in nature , we calculated a combined value of transit depth by taking the mean of the two values listed above : 0.582@xmath50.026% .",

    "the discrepancy between the transit depths of _",
    "kepler_-445c is a result of the crowding metric applied by the pre - search data conditioning ( pdc ) module of the _ kepler _ pipeline @xcite .",
    "this metric , defined as `` crowdsap '' in the header of the _ kepler _ light curve files , is the ratio of the target flux to the total flux in the photometric aperture .",
    "it is a quarterly - averaged , scalar value between zero and unity . only the pdcsap version of the flux reported by _",

    "together , the usno - b phantom star inherited by the kic , the original method used to construct the stellar scene of _ kepler_-445 , and the timing of the initial characterization of _ kepler_-445c formed an improbable series of events that led to the overestimation of the transit depth of _ kepler_-445c .",
    "the original radius of _ kepler_-445c , 2.51@xmath50.36@xmath2 @xcite , placed it in the interesting regime of exoplanets with sizes between the earth and neptune that are highly amenable to atmospheric characterization ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . with ground - based observations of additional transits of this exoplanet",

    ", we scale their _ kepler _ transit depths using the ratio of crowdsap values before and after the soc pipeline update (  [ sec : crowd ] ) and briefly discuss the potential nature of these small exoplanets .",
    "the previously measured transit depths of _ kepler_-445b and _ kepler_-445d are 0.46@xmath50.36% and 0.28@xmath50.58% , respectively . multiplying these depths by a factor of 0.52 to correct for the phantom star aperture contamination yields depths of @xmath00.24% and @xmath00.15% .",
    "estimating the transit depth as @xmath97 and applying the _",
    "kepler_-445 stellar radius from @xcite yields planetary radii of @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",

    "it is interesting that the revised radii of all three planets are at or below the threshold of 1.6@xmath2 from @xcite , suggesting that all three have primarily rocky compositions .",

    "these updates corrected the transit depth of _ kepler_-445c and greatly reduced the probability of errors in the kic contaminating other _ kepler _ pdcsap light curves .",

    "the authors contributed a discussion on this topic to the 2016 august 8 version of the _ kepler _ data release notes 25 on mast .",
    "conducting a direct search for phantom stars is a challenging task given the number of sources comprising the kic .",
    "indirect searches ( e.g. , by flux or transit depth changes between different pipeline versions ) are also complicated since large crowdsap variations can correctly accompany changes in the optimal photometric apertures .",
    "furthermore , different versions of the pipeline typically operate with different amounts of data .",
    "the sensitivity added by additional transits must also be considered when searching for phantom stars indirectly .",
    "phantom stars are likely a rare occurrence . however",

    "this has the potential to affect investigations that make use of the pdcsap transit depths for a large number of exoplanets , where individual follow - up observation of each is not possible ( e.g. , studies of planet occurrence rates , planet populations , or transit signal recovery efficiencies ) .",
    "the sizes of exoplanets in the perplexing earth - to - neptune regime only span a few earth radii .",
    "a factor of two correction to the transit depth , corresponding to a @xmath100 change in planetary radius , can therefore crucially alter the interpretation of a planet s interior and atmosphere . in this way , assessing the crowding in the scene of an exoplanet host  which is a necessary step in the data conditioning process  has the potential to obscure the understanding of these exoplanets further .",
    "although the case of _ kepler_-445c was highly improbable , it emphasizes the level of caution that must be exercised when analyzing and interpreting data from exoplanet transit surveys .      in the near future , the transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( tess ) is expected to launch and begin surveying the entire sky for nearby exoplanets @xcite . whereas the pixels on the _ kepler _ detectors have a plate scale of @xmath101 pixel@xmath7 , tess pixels will cover even more sky , with @xmath102 pixel@xmath7 .",
    "tess will therefore be even more susceptible to crowding and stellar catalog errors than _ kepler_. the analysis of tess observations will of course be informed by the many lessons learned from the _ kepler _ data set , and a careful treatment of the crowding metric should be no exception .",
