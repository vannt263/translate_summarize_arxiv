    "due to elastic disorder in the n conductor or its restricted geometry , a large number of consecutive phase - preserving andreev reflections can occur at the ns interface making it effectively transparent to pair current .",
    "this gives rise to a veriety of phase - coherent phenomena such as , e.g. the zero - bias enhancement of the electron conductance  @xcite above the value predicted by the theory of a single - event scattering at an ns boundary  @xcite , the finite bias and magnetic field anomalies of the phase - coherent conductance  @xcite , the formation of a superconducting minigap in the quasiparticle density of states in normal systems  @xcite , andreev edge states  @xcite and billiards  @xcite .",
    "while phase - coherent charge transport has been receiving considerable attention , heat conduction properties of mesoscopic proximity structures have been explored to a much lesser extent .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to report a theoretical study of anomalous magnetic field behaviour of heat transport in low - dimensional proximity structures .",
    "the choice of low - dimensional systems is motivated by a progress in fabrication of superconducting contacts to high - mobility semiconductor quantum wells ( see e.g. refs .",
    "a number of experimental observations have suggested that due to the proximity effect such systems acquire properties of `` clean '' superconductors where the electron mean free path @xmath1 is large compared to the induced superconducting coherence length @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in planar semiconductor - superconductor junctions the proximity effect can be described in terms of andreev bound states formed between the ns boundary and the back wall of the quantum well  @xcite .",
    "each andreev state is a mixed particle - hole excitation whose spectrum , according to the theory of ref .",

    "since @xmath9 , the energy shift leads to the gapless excitation spectrum and ultimately to the metallic behaviour of the thermal conductance .",

    "can be as large as 10 - 13  @xcite , and therefore the magnetic spin splitting may play an important role . at first glance , the combined influence of the screening supercurrent and the spin splitting on the superconducting proximity should anyway be a destructive one because both of them break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "however , as shown below the interplay between the zeeman energy @xmath10 and the galilean shift @xmath6 , which are both linear in @xmath14 , can lead to the existence of andreev states with the minigap independent of the magnetic field .",
    "unlike the case of spinless electrons  @xcite , the thermal conductance remains anomalously small compared to that of a normal state even at relatively strong fields , up to the critical fields of the superconductor .",
    "the predicted behaviour of the thermal magnetotransport is also rather different from the observed in diffusive superconductors  @xcite where the constructive interplay of the supercurrent and zeeman effects is obstructed by strong momentum scattering due to which the linear galilean term averages out  @xcite . instead",
