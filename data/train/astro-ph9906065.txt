    "the star lhs  3250 ( lp70 - 238 ; wd1653 + 630 ) is a faint star discovered by luyten ( 1970 ; 1976 ) to have a proper motion of 0.512 arcsec yr@xmath4 in a position angle of 275.2@xmath5 and a color - class `` f '' .",
    "these properties indicate that it is likely to be a white dwarf , and it was observed spectroscopically by hintzen ( 1986 ) who verified it as being a white dwarf with a classification of dc9 .",
    "usno parallax observations began in 1992 , and they have now confirmed that the star has the very low luminosity of a cool white dwarf ( discussed in section 2 ) .",
    "however , in the process of measuring its colors accurately , we have found it to have a unique spectral energy distribution .",
    "optical spectra and polarization data have been obtained , and lead us to conclude that most likely it has an extremely low temperature .",
    "this conclusion is of particular interest because low - temperature , low - luminosity white dwarfs in the galactic disk can constrain the early star - formation history of the disk , and because such stars in the galactic halo potentially can contribute significant mass to the halo . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the unusual properties of this star , and attempt to arrive at a plausible description of its nature .",
    "lhs  3250 was observed with the 1.5  m strand telescope and a tektronix 2048x2048 ccd camera as part of the usno parallax program during 19921998 .",
    "this configuration gives typical errors of @xmath60.5 mas in the relative parallax with 50 observations or more .",
    "lhs  3250 was observed with 84 images taken on 81 nights .",
    "the general observing and reduction procedures for the tek2048 astrometry are described by monet et al .",
    "the astrometric results are shown in table 1 .",
    "future observers should note that the coordinates given in the lhs catalogue are incorrect by 1.6 arcmin ",
    "the lhs atlas has the correct star marked , and the correct coordinates are given in table 1 .",
    "also , the proper motion given in the lhs catalogue differs from that given in table 1 by much more than is normally found for lhs stars .",
    "we know of no reason for this discrepancy unless the star was near the faint limit on one of luyten s plates .",
    "visual @xmath7 photometry of lhs  3250 was obtained with the usno 1  m telescope using a tektronix 1024x1024 ccd on four nights ( two in 1995 and two in 1998 ) .",
    "infrared @xmath8 photometry was obtained with the kpno 4  m telescope using the onis infrared imager with an aladdin insb detector on three nights in 1998 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 and one night for @xmath11 .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 .",
    "the @xmath12 data are on the cousins system , and the @xmath8 data are on the cit system .",
    "comparison of the data from different nights shows no evidence for variability larger than about 2% .",
    "some of the observed color combinations are displayed in figure 1 , where the colors of lhs  3250 are compared to the sample of cool white dwarfs published by bergeron et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and leggett et al .",
    "the @xmath13 colors for this sample of stars were taken from mccook & sion ( 1998 ) .",
    "the colors of lhs  3250 contrast strongly with other white dwarfs , providing the first evidence for the unusual properties of this star .",
    "( lhs  1126 is also marked in the figure because it may be a similar type of star , as we discuss in section 3 . ) the @xmath13 and @xmath14 colors are both consistent with a cool white dwarf with @xmath15  k , while the @xmath16 and @xmath17 colors would normally indicate a much hotter temperature .",
    "the flux distribution in table 2 is strongly peaked near 6000   . to the eye",
    ", this star would appear distinctly orange .",
    "the colors shown in figure 1 can not arise from a composite spectrum , as could be produced by a physical binary system or a chance alignment with a field star .",
    "therefore , this region of the color - color plots in figure 1 is usually empty .",
    "in fact , no other objects are known to fall near lhs  3250 in figure 1b other than qsos with redshift near 3.5 - 4.0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , stars like lhs  3250 should be identified easily in a broadband survey using @xmath2 filters or the sloan @xmath18 filters .",
    "low - resolution spectra have been obtained with the steward observatory 2.3  m bok telescope , the palomar 5  m telescope , and the keck ii 10  m telescope .",
    "all data show a continuous spectrum with no detectable features , confirming the dc classification made by hintzen ( 1986 ) .",
    "the spectrum with the highest signal / noise is that from the keck telescope , a 15-minute exposure taken with the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( @xcite ) , with a resolution of 9   .",
    "it is displayed in figure 2 .",
    "( this spectrum was converted from counts to a flux scale using the other three flux - calibrated spectra and the broad - band photometry .",
    "finally , 3-pixel smoothing was applied . ) beside the wavelength coverage shown in this spectrum , the spectrum from the steward 2.3  m telescope with 60 min integration includes 3600 - 4000     ( albeit with lower signal / noise ) .",
    "it is included in figure 2 , and shows no detectable calcium features .",
    "we also note that hintzen s spectra covered only the blue spectral region ( 3600 - 5400   ) and that he mentioned no calcium features .",
    "the spectral energy distribution shown in figure 2 is unlike any other known white dwarf . a comparison with other spectra of dc and other cool white dwarfs ( e.g. , wesemael et al . 1993 , figure 15 ; bergeron et al .",
    "1997 , figure 18 ) shows that the sudden decline in flux redward of 6000    is contrary to the normal behavior of cool white dwarfs , where @xmath19 reaches a maximum redward of @xmath20 .",
    "white dwarfs with unusual colors are often found to have both distorted spectra and significant circular polarization due to photospheric emission in a strong magnetic field ( @xmath21 g ) . to investigate this possibility",
    ", data were also obtained with the ccd spectropolarimeter ( @xcite ) on the steward observatory 2.3  m bok telescope on two occasions in 1998 . in figure 3",
    "are displayed polarization spectra as @xmath22 resulting from sequences totaling 40 min and 53 min on 1 apr . and 23 sep .",
    ", respectively .",
    "both occasions show a distinct lack of significant circular polarization on either side of the 6000  spectral break , and the 3@xmath23 upper limit for the spectrum - added polarization is @xmath24 in each dataset .",
    "we conclude that magnetism is a very unlikely explanation for the peculiar energy distribution of lhs 3250 .      with",
    "the absolute magnitude ( table 1 ) and observed colors ( table 2 ) , we can construct color - magnitude diagrams that are usually indicative of the approximate temperature and mass of white dwarfs .",
    "figure 4 shows the @xmath25 vs. @xmath14 diagram in panel ( a ) and @xmath25 vs. @xmath16 in panel ( b ) . in this figure ,",
    "lhs  3250 is compared with other white dwarfs with accurate parallaxes obtained with ccds at usno , plus the unusual low - luminosity star eso439 - 26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the points include all white dwarfs from monet et al .",
    "( 1992 ) plus other white dwarfs with parallaxes determined since 1992 but not yet published ; all points are shown with their formal one - sigma error bars .",
    "the curves show the model - atmosphere colors of white dwarfs with pure hydrogen and pure helium atmospheres ( @xcite ) .",
    "the four white dwarfs known to have high surface gravity and high mass from spectrophotometric studies are labelled ; they stand out from other stars in both panels . from this figure",
    ", one would derive for lhs  3250 a somewhat high mass ( near 0.8 @xmath26 ) and a cool temperature from the @xmath14 color , but an extraordinarily - high mass ( near 1.4 @xmath26 ) and high temperature from the @xmath16 color .",
    "this discrepancy is another symptom of the peculiar colors of lhs  3250 shown in figure 1 . in the following discussion ,",
    "we conclude that probably neither diagram gives a correct understanding of the star because its colors are far from being indicative of its temperature or gravity .      in order to establish the luminosity of lhs  3250 , the bolometric correction ( bc )",
    "is needed .",
    "using @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the transmission function of the @xmath29 filter , we derive bc  @xmath30 .",
    "the uncertainty is due to the coarse sampling of the spectrum shown in figure 5 .",
    "this value is quite different from that for normal cool white dwarfs which have bc  @xmath31 at @xmath32  k to bc  @xmath33 at @xmath34  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , positive values of bc are reproduced in the models of very cool white dwarfs with strong collision - induced absorbtion ( cia ; see section 3.2 ) owing to their large infrared flux deficiency .",
    "we then derive @xmath35 and log(@xmath36 . with the exception of the high - mass star eso439 - 26 ,",
    "this is the lowest luminosity known for any white dwarf .",
    "the low luminosity of lhs  3250 raises the question of its membership in the galactic disk or halo .",
    "can we otherwise determine its origin , and perhaps thereby place some constraints on its age ?",
    "its tangential velocity ( table 1 ) is typical of a white dwarf in the old disk .",
    "however , its galactic coordinates ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) mean that its proper motion reflects primarily its @xmath39 and @xmath40 space velocities , while its @xmath29 velocity is mostly projected into the unknown radial velocity .",
    "one could hypothesize a radial velocity in the range 170 to 220  km  s@xmath4 which would result in @xmath29 velocity components in the range 180 to 220  km  s@xmath4 , respectively , and @xmath40 velocity components in the range 50 to 80  km  s@xmath4 , respectively , values typical of stars in the galactic halo .",
    "however , the dc nature of the spectrum offers no possiblity for testing this hypothesis .",
    "therefore , its kinematics do not identify its population of origin .",
    "despite the fact that the luminosity of lhs  3250 is well determined , its effective temperature must be defined more accurately before we can proceed further .",
    "everything else about the star ( the mass , the radius , the cooling age , and the evolutionary state ) depends on determining @xmath41 accurately . in this section , we attempt to constrain the temperature from the observed spectral energy distribution .",
    "then in the following section ( section 4 ) , we discuss further constraints imposed from the accurate luminosity and other considerations .    the unique spectral energy distribution is given in table 2 and shown in figure 5 .",
    "a comparison with white dwarf model colors ( @xcite ) shows that a model star with @xmath15  k matches the @xmath42 data for lhs  3250 quite well , while a model star with @xmath43  k and a helium - dominated atmosphere matches the @xmath44 data . apparently strong absorption is occuring in the atmosphere of lhs  3250 , either at blue wavelengths if the star is hot , or at red / near - infrared wavelengths if it has a cool temperature .",
    "first we consider the possibility that it is hot .",
    "hot white dwarfs normally have hydrogen or helium lines visible : da stars with hydrogen atmospheres have h@xmath45 present with an equivalent width of @xmath461    when the temperature is @xmath47  k ( @xcite ) , while db stars with helium atmospheres have hei lines present at @xmath484471 , 5876 , and 6678 when the temperature is @xmath49  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , dc stars are known with classifications as hot as class dc5 , with @xmath14 colors @xmath500.00 , indicating temperatures @xmath51  k for helium - dominated atmospheres ; at hotter temperatures helium lines become visible . because lhs  3250 shows neither hydrogen nor helium lines , its temperature must be @xmath52  k , but this temperature is not hot enough to match the @xmath44 data .",
    "the hot - star alternative also requires some _ continuous _ absorption at blue wavelengths to explain the energy distribution in figure 5 .",
    "however , possible sources of continuous absorption ( molecules , for example ) , will not be present in a high - temperature atmosphere .",
    "the dz ( metallic - lined ) and dx ( peculiar ) white dwarfs sometimes have broad absorption features [ e.g. , g99 - 44 , lp701 - 29 , and g240 - 72 ( @xcite ) ] , but only when they are cool ; hot white dwarfs never show such broad absorption so as to be classified dc .",
    "most of the stars with broad ( often unidentified ) features also have identified metallic features , primarily ca lines , which are not seen in lhs  3250 ( section 2 )",
    ".    a further consequence of a high temperature for lhs  3250 would be that it would have a high mass , probably near the chandrasekhar limit , as shown in figure 4(b ) .",
    "this would be required by its faint absolute magnitude , which places it 2 - 3 mag fainter than any white dwarfs of similarly high temperature .",
    "eso439 - 26 , for example ( see figure 4 ) , has a temperature near 4500  k and a mass @xmath53 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a high mass ( and resulting high gravity ) is possible , but it probably would not help explain the peculiar colors , as gravity has virtually no effect on the colors of hot , helium - dominated atmospheres ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we believe that a high temperature for lhs  3250 is unlikely .",
    "can the unusual energy distribution be explained with a cool temperature ?",
    "molecular opacities are potentially important in the high gravity of a cool white dwarf atmosphere and might supply the continuous opacity apparently needed to understand lhs  3250 .",
    "a possible explanation is that collision - induced absorption ( cia ) by molecular hydrogen molecules with other h and he atoms and molecules become important in a high - density atmosphere .",
    "these collisions induce a temporary dipole moment in the h@xmath54 molecule that creates permitted dipole transitions and a greatly increased opacity at red and near - infrared wavelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the effect is greatest in a helium - dominated atmosphere that is otherwise very transparent . ]",
    "is dominating the opacity for wavelengths @xmath466000   .",
    "the effects of cia on the colors of cool white dwarfs with various hydrogen / helium compositions have been described by bergeron et al .",
    "( 1995a ) and hansen ( 1999 ) .",
    "various models for white dwarfs with extremely low temperatures and pure hydrogen atmospheres ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) agree in predicting strong flux - deficiencies for @xmath55 , a peak in the flux distribution near @xmath56   , and blue @xmath16 and @xmath17 colors .",
    "however , high - density helium atmospheres are difficult to model , and no models of mixed - composition atmospheres are presently available for temperatures below 4000  k. the models that are available predict stronger infrared absorption , and a bluer wavelength at which the flux reaches a maximum , for lower temperatures and for he / h ratios of roughly 10 to 100 .",
    "the blue @xmath17 color of lhs  1126 ( a star noted in figure 1c ) was explained by this mechanism ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "here , we see that lhs  3250 has much more extreme colors than lhs  1126 , so the effect of cia must be much stronger if it is the explanation for the colors of lhs  3250 .",
    "a start at fitting the spectral energy distribution of lhs  3250 has been made by bergeron ( 1999 ) , and the result kindly made available to us . the composition was assumed to be pure hydrogen .",
    "a grid of model atmospheres extending from 4000k to 1500k was calculated at intervals of 250k for log  @xmath57  7.0 , 7.5 , 8.0 , 8.5 , 9.0 .",
    "the models were calculated as described in bergeron et  al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "the equation of state was modified to include molecular h@xmath54 , h@xmath58 h@xmath59 as in saumon et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) , utilizing the opacity calculations of lenzuini et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) with the cia coefficients for h@xmath54 , h and he species from borosow et  al .",
    "similar models were used previously for detailed analyses of cool white dwarfs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . due to the lack of evolutionary models ( such as the c / o core grid of wood used in earlier papers ) , zero temperature results for helium cores were adopted ( @xcite ) , and should provide an adequate mass - radius relation at these low temperatures .    an approximate fit to the @xmath60 flux distribution , using a pure hydrogen atmosphere , is shown in figure 5 ( middle panel ) .",
    "the result is an extremely low temperature",
    "( @xmath61  k ) , where the fit has been done assuming a plausible value of log  @xmath62 .",
    "the model is qualitatively close to the data , and shows that strong cia in a hydrogen atmosphere with very low temperature is possible .",
    "a similar temperature near 2100  k would be derived from the models with pure hydrogen by saumon & jacobson ( 1999 ) , and presumably with those by chabrier ( 1999 ) , but temperatures are not included for the latter models .",
    "however , we discuss below some difficulties that arise with a temperature this low and a pure hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "instead , helium - dominated atmosphere models ( @xcite ) may be more realistic . in these models , cia is strong at temperatures as high as 4000  k , and becomes strongest ( at a given temperature ) for he / h compositions of 10 - 100 .",
    "one such model is also shown in figure 5 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "it _ does not _ reproduce the flux distribution of lhs  3250 in detail , but it does reproduce the strong infrared flux deficiency seen . apparently a temperature lower than 4000  k is required to give increased cia opacity to match the data .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the temperature is in the range @xmath63  k , and the he / h ratio is near zero if the temperature is at the low end of the range , and is large ( perhaps 10 - 100 ) if the temperature is at the high end of the range .",
    "in this section , we explore the physical parameters of lhs  3250 ( the radius , mass , and cooling age ) and its evolutionary state . these quantities are directly related to its well - determined luminosity and its approximately - known temperature .",
    "a detailed analysis will require mixed - composition model atmospheres at cooler temperatures than are available now , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our present goal is to constrain the physical parameters ( if possible ) by considering a range of possible temperatures ( @xmath63  k , as determined above ) , and exploring the consequences of each temperature .",
    "table 3 gives a summary of these results .",
    "here , the second column lists the radius derived for each possible temperature , using the measured luminosity above .",
    "this is followed by the mass , as derived from mass - radius relations for white dwarfs with different core and atmospheric compositions . for this purpose",
    ", we give the mass for each value of the radius found using different models listed in the footnotes to table 3 .",
    "finally , the table gives the ( very approximate ) cooling time to reach @xmath64 , taken from the same models .",
    "table 3 shows that ( 1 ) the mass depends strongly on the adopted temperature , ( 2 ) the exact mass depends on the presence and thickness of a hydrogen atmosphere , and ( 3 ) a helium core and a mass lower than normal for a white dwarf are very possible , but a normal mass and a carbon / oxygen core are also possible .    because a helium core and a reduced mass must be a result of mass transfer in a binary system , and because such mass transfer often leaves a double white dwarf system with the two stars having nearly equal masses , we have added a second set of values to table 3 for the case of a composite of two equal - luminosity white dwarfs .",
    "for such a composite system , the luminosity of each star at a given possible temperature is less than for the single - star case by a factor of 2 , the radius is less by a factor of @xmath65 , the mass is greater by a factor of @xmath501.5 - 2.5 , and the cooling age to reach @xmath66 is generally much greater",
    ".    table 3 indicates that lhs  3250 could have a wide variety of states .",
    "first , if lhs  3250 has a c / o core , it could be a single star with a mass near 0.50 - 0.55  @xmath26 , a temperature near 3800  k , and a cooling time of about 9  gyr .",
    "a helium - dominated atmosphere would be required to reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution at this relatively high temperature ( section 3 ) .",
    "second , if lhs  3250 has a helium core with a helium - dominated atmosphere , table 3 shows that it could have a wide range of temperatures ( @xmath67  k ) and masses ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "it could be a single visible star or a composite double white dwarf with somewhat lower temperatures and masses .",
    "finally , if lhs  3250 has a helium core and a hydrogen atmosphere , then the spectral energy distribution requires a temperature near 2000  k. then table 3 shows that a very low mass , @xmath69 , is required to give the large radius demanded by such a low temperature .",
    "evolutionary models for he - core stars by driebe et al .",
    "( 1999 ) may further limit the states that are possible for lhs  3250 .",
    "these models are intended to include a realistic thickness of hydrogen envelope on low - mass stars based on when and how fast mass is lost during evolution on the red giant branch .",
    "these authors argue that a thick hydrogen envelope will inevitably survive on he - core stars with @xmath70 , and that the structure of the stars will give prolonged h - burning , resulting in the cooling times being extended significantly .",
    "if these evolutionary models are correct , then a mass @xmath71 would result in a cooling time greater than the age of the universe to reach the low luminosity of lhs  3250 , and must be ruled out .",
    "this conclusion eliminates all states with very low - mass , including all states with a hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "only two remaining states are allowed : a single he - core white dwarf with a temperature in the range @xmath72  k , a mass 0.3 - 0.45  @xmath26 , and a cooling time of roughly 12  gyr ; or a composite of two he - core white dwarfs with a temperature close to 2700  k , a mass @xmath73 , and a cooling time @xmath74  gyr .",
    "only if somehow the predicted thick h envelope has been lost ( or perhaps some h has been accreted since the white dwarf formed with a helium atmosphere ) , then perhaps a thin h atmosphere , with the very low temperature and low mass , is still possible .",
    "both `` thin atmosphere '' models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) predict that convection will mix helium up into the atmosphere , diluting the hydrogen as a low - mass star cools .",
    "however , below roughly 4000  k , a radiative zone develops ( @xcite ) and diffusion should remove the helium , again leaving a pure - h atmosphere .",
    "this scenario appears to be the only possibility that lhs  3250 has a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere .    applying these constraints",
    ", we can place lhs  3250 in the h - r diagram .",
    "figure 6 shows lhs  3250 , again compared with the same sample of cool white dwarfs shown in figure 1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "lhs  3250 has a lower luminosity than any star except the massive white dwarf eso439 - 26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "lhs  3250 is plotted with the possible temperatures derived above .",
    "a he - core white dwarf must have lost mass during its giant - branch evolution through mass transfer in a close binary system . also , the composite double white dwarf states discussed above might have the two stars comprising a close binary system , and possibly having exchanged mass .",
    "therefore , lhs  3250 may be ( or may once have been ) a binary .",
    "the companion could be a neutron star , and thus not detectable unless it was also a pulsar ; then lhs  3250 would be like an older version of the low - mass white dwarfs found to be the visible companions of some millisecond pulsars .",
    "alternatively , we may be seeing a composite of two white dwarfs , both with similar low temperatures .",
    "close binaries which undergo common - envelope evolution are believed to be the likely progenitors of double - degenerate stars with a he - core component ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these progenitors can , and apparently often do , produce a pair of nearly identical stars .",
    "examples are the pair of c / o white dwarfs l870 - 2 ( @xcite ) , and the pairs of he - core white dwarfs l101 - 26 ( @xcite ) and ton1323 ( @xcite ) . of the other",
    "known close double - degenerate stars , most have a he - core primary star ( @xcite ) , with a secondary star of unknown type .",
    "therefore , arriving at a close binary system with both components being such very cool ( and very old ) he - core stars is plausible .",
    "stars related to lhs  3250 have recently been found in the globular cluster ngc  6397 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "three `` non - flickering '' stars appear to be he - core white dwarfs with masses @xmath75 , and the one with an observed spectrum has a hydrogen atmosphere with @xmath76  k and a mass @xmath77 .",
    "all three stars are much hotter and more luminous than lhs  3250 , and are much younger ( more recently formed ) white dwarfs . thus the three may eventually evolve to be similar to lhs  3250 .    in conclusion ,",
    "we find lhs  3250 to have a temperature sufficiently low that its colors are strongly affected by some continuous absorption , probably cia from molecular hydrogen . as such",
    ", it provides the first example of a very cool white dwarf with blue @xmath44 colors , and it supports models of white dwarfs with h or h / he atmospheres ( @xcite ; ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that show their @xmath44 colors becoming bluer with decreasing temperature and luminosity .",
    "finding other white dwarfs with low ( and lower ) luminosities and temperatures is currently of interest for determining the density and luminosity function of old disk and halo white dwarfs .",
    "the population ( disk or halo ) to which lhs  3250 belongs is not known .",
    "it may be a product of mass transfer in a close binary system , not a result of single - star evolution .",
    "nevertheless , its noteworthy colors at this very low temperature support the conjecture that many low - luminosity white dwarfs in the halo will have blue colors .",
    "stars like lhs  3250 will be easy to identify in photometric surveys , so we should soon measure how frequently they occur .",
    "we thank p. bergeron for calculating low - temperature models of pure hydrogen white dwarfs and making available his fit to our data .",

    "<S> the star lhs  3250 is found to be a white dwarf at a distance of 30  pc . </S>",
    "<S> its absolute magnitudes ( @xmath0 ; @xmath1 ) put it among the least - luminous white dwarfs known . </S>",
    "<S> its optical spectrum shows no features , indicating it has a dc classification , and it shows no detectable polarization , indicating it does not have a very strong magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> . however , its broadband colors show it to have a unique spectral energy distribution , and it stands out from all other stars in @xmath2 and other broadband photometric surveys .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these properties , and conclude that lhs  3250 must be an extremely cool white dwarf with strong collision - induced absorption at red - infrared wavelengths from molecular hydrogen , in accord with models for very cool white dwarf atmospheres . if so , it is the first such star known , and the first star to provide observational evidence supporting these models . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests that other very cool white dwarfs , both halo white dwarfs and the oldest disk white dwarfs , also may have colors affected by similar absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the atmospheric composition of lhs  3250 is not known , and therefore its temperature is poorly determined . </S>",
    "<S> it may be a helium - core star with a mass @xmath3 and a product of mass - transfer in a close binary system . </S>",
    "<S> however , until its temperature is better known , its mass and age remain uncertain . </S>"
