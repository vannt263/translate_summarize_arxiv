    "some of the experimental discoveries at rhic , notably the unexpectedly large medium effects known as elliptic flow and jet quenching , led to the suggestion that the deconfined qcd matter produced in the intermediate stages of a heavy ion collision is strongly interacting .",
    "the phenomenon of jet quenching is particularly intriguing in that sense , as this probes the hadronic matter on a relatively hard scale ( a few gev ) , where qcd is _ a priori _ expected to be weakly coupled , by asymptotic freedom .",
    "one manifestation of this phenomenon is the ` away jet suppression ' in au+au collisions : unlike in p+p or d+au collisions , where the hard particles typically emerge from the collision region as pairs of back  to  back jets , in the au+au collisions one sees ` mono  jet ' events in which the second jet is missing ( at rhic , ` jet ' means leading particle ) .",
    "this has the following natural interpretation : the hard scattering producing the jets has occurred near the edge of the interaction region , so that one of the jets has escaped and triggered a detector , while the other one has been deflected , slowed down , or even absorbed , via interactions in the surrounding medium .",
    "if this medium is composed of weakly interacting quasiparticles ( quarks and gluons ) , then the deflection of the hard jet is due to its successive scattering off these quasiparticles , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : quench ] left .",
    "this leads to the following estimate for the rate of transverse momentum broadening @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the gluon distribution in the medium on the resolution scale @xmath2 of the hard jet , as produced via quantum evolution from the medium intrinsic scale up to @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , if the medium is a finite  temperature plasma with temperature @xmath4 , then @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are the quark and gluon densities in thermal equilibrium and @xmath7 are the gluon distributions produced by a single quark , respectively gluon , on the scale @xmath8 .",
    "some typical values at rhic are @xmath9  gev and @xmath10  gev . at the lhc ,",
    "they become @xmath11  gev and @xmath12 gev ( for actual jets ) . assuming weak coupling",
    ", one can compute eq .   in perturbation theory .",
    "but by doing that , one finds an estimate @xmath13 which is considerably smaller ( by almost one order of magnitude ) then the value extracted from the rhic data !",
    "this puzzle is comforted by the first data for pb+pb collisions at lhc , which confirm the strong jet quenching observed at rhic and suggest that the medium effects can remain important even for jets as hard as @xmath14  gev .",
    "a possible solution to this puzzle is that the deconfined qcd matter is ( relatively ) strongly coupled .",
    "this would enhance the quantum evolution from @xmath4 to @xmath3 and also the interactions between the hard probe and the medium .",
    "note that there is not necessarily a conflict with asymptotic freedom : to get an enhanced gluon distribution on the hard scale @xmath3 , it is enough to have a stronger coupling at the lower end of the evolution , that is , at the softer scale @xmath4 .",
    "we have indeed @xmath15 for the temperatures",
    "@xmath4 of interest at rhic and lhc .",
    "actually , it should be possible to study some aspects of this evolution in lattice qcd at finite@xmath4 and thus verify the hypothesis of strong coupling @xcite .",
    "the previous discussion invites us to a better understanding of the properties of the quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) at relatively strong coupling , that is , for @xmath16 .",
    "however , even without the complications of confinement , the qcd calculations at strong coupling remain notoriously difficult .",
    "( in particular , lattice qcd can not be used for real  time processes like transport phenomena and scattering . )",
    "so it has become common practice to look to the @xmath17 supersymmetric yang",
    " mills ( sym ) theory , whose strong coupling regime can be addressed within the ads / cft correspondence , for guidance as to general properties of strongly coupled plasmas .",
    "@xmath18 sym has the ` color ' gauge symmetry su@xmath19 , so like qcd , but differs from the latter in some other aspects : it has ( maximal ) supersymmetry and hence conformal symmetry ( the coupling @xmath20 is fixed ) and all the fields in its lagrangian ( gluons , scalars , and fermions ) transform in the adjoint representation of su@xmath19 . but",
    "these differences are believed not to be essential for a study of the qgp phase of qcd in the temperature range of interest for heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc , that is , @xmath21 with @xmath22  mev the critical temperature for deconfinement .",
    "indeed , lattice studies indicate that the qgp itself is nearly conformal in this window .    the ads / cft correspondence is the statement that the gauge theory @xmath18 sym is ` dual ' ( _ i.e. _ , equivalent ) to a special type of string theory living in the @xmath23 space  time with ads@xmath24 geometry",
    "this duality is particularly useful in that it relates the strong ",
    "t hooft coupling limit @xmath25 ( with fixed @xmath26 ) of the gauge theory to the weak  coupling limit of the string theory , in which the latter reduces to classical gravity ( ` supergravity ' or sugra ) . the anti - de - sitter space ",
    "time ads@xmath27 can be viewed as the product between the physical space ",
    "time with @xmath28 ( the minkowski boundary of ads@xmath27 ) and a fifth ( or ` radial ' ) dimension @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "adding temperature on the gauge theory side corresponds to embedding a black hole ( bh ) in ads@xmath27 , with the bh horizon located at a distance @xmath31 away from the minkowski boundary at @xmath32 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wave ] for some illustrations . )         within this context , the gauge interactions between a hard probe and the strongly coupled plasma are described as the gravitational interactions between the dual bulk object ( a string or a field ) representing the hard probe and the bh .",
    "this amounts to solving the classical equation of motion for the propagation of the dual object in the ads@xmath27 bh space  time .",
    "for instance , one can unveil the parton structure of the plasma by studying ` deep inelastic scattering ' ( dis ) , that is , the propagation of a virtual photon with space ",
    "like 4momentum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wave].a ) .",
    "the dual object in the bulk is a vector field field @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 or @xmath29 ) which obeys the maxwell equations in curved space  time : @xmath35 the gravitational interactions are encoded in the 5d metric tensor @xmath36 , which involves the horizon of the bh .    similarly , in order to study the phenomenon of",
    "` jet quenching ' for a heavy quark , one needs the corresponding ` dual ' object in the bulk .",
    "this is a string hanging down in ads@xmath27 with one endpoint attached to the heavy quark on the boundary ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wave].b ) .",
    "the average string profile can be obtained by solving the corresponding equation of motion ( the nambu ",
    "goto equation ) in the background of the bh .",
    "then the rate @xmath37 for energy loss is computed as the flux of energy down the string .",
    "also , the momentum broadening follows by studying the ( small ) fluctuations of the string along this average profile .",
    "these fluctuations reflect stochastic phenomena in the physical problem , whose precise nature will be discussed later on .",
    "this string problem is mathematically involved in the general case , but it has been fully carried out in one special situation , known as the ` trailing string ' @xcite : this is the steady situation where the quark ( and hence the string as a whole ) moves at constant velocity under the action of an external force , which supplies the energy that is continuously lost towards the plasma / bh .",
    "it turns out that the two problems alluded to above  dis off the plasma and the quenching of a heavy quark  are connected at a deeper physical level : the partonic picture of the strongly  coupled plasma , as emerging from dis @xcite , enables us to propose a physical interpretation for the ads / cft results for the trailing string , and also a rapid derivation of these results to parametric accuracy @xcite .",
    "the key observation is that both phenomena are controlled by the same fundamental scale : a ( space  like ) virtuality scale that we shall refer to as the ` saturation momentum ' @xmath38 .",
    "this scale is an intrinsic property of the medium ( more precisely , of its parton distribution ) , although it also depends upon the energy of the ` projectile ' ( the hard probe )  the latter only fixes the energy resolution at which one probes the partonic distribution in the ` target ' ( the plasma ) .",
    "specifically , consider a space  like photon with 4momentum @xmath39 and virtuality @xmath40 which propagates through the plasma . by solving the ads equation ,",
    "one finds two physical regimes : ` ( i ) ` a _ low energy _",
    "regime at @xmath41 , where there is essentially no interaction between the bulk field @xmath33 and the bh ( physically , this means that the plasma looks transparent to the virtual photon ) , and ` ( ii ) ` a _ high energy _",
    "regime at @xmath42 , where the field feels the attraction of the bh and eventually falls into it ( _ i.e. _ , the photon is completely absorbed by the plasma ) .",
    "this strong energy dependence of the results is natural in the context of gravity , since gravitational interactions are proportional to the energy .",
    "the physical interpretation of these results back in the original gauge theory is more subtle and relies on the ` uv / ir correspondence ' .",
    "this correspondence states that the radial penetration @xmath29 of the bulk field in @xmath43 is proportional to the transverse size @xmath44 of the partonic fluctuation of the virtual photon on the boundary ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wave].a ) .",
    "consider e.g. a space  like photon in the vacuum : energy  momentum conservation implies that this photon can not decay into on  shell quanta , but only fluctuate into a virtual partonic fluctuation with lifetime @xmath45 and transverse size @xmath46 , as determined by the uncertainty principle . and",
    "indeed , in the low energy regime above mentioned , the solution @xmath33 to eq .",
    "is found to penetrate in ads@xmath27 ( via diffusion : @xmath47 ) up to a maximal distance @xmath48 , which is reached after a time @xmath49 .    to similarly understand the high energy regime and the critical value @xmath50 separating between the two regimes",
    ", one needs an additional piece of information : when viewing the equation of motion for the bulk field @xmath33 through the prism of the uv / ir correspondence , one concludes that the strongly  coupled plasma acts on partonic fluctuations with a _ tidal force _",
    "@xmath51 which pulls the partons apart .",
    "the partons become nearly on  shell when the mechanical work @xmath52 provided by this force during the lifetime @xmath45 of the fluctuation is large enough to compensate the energy deficit @xmath53 of the space  like system .",
    "this condition requires @xmath54 or @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the plasma _",
    "saturation momentum_.    to summarize , a virtual photon with relatively high energy , or low virtuality @xmath55 , disappears into the plasma because this photon can branch into partons under the action of the plasma force . then the daughter partons can branch again and again , until the virtuality of the descendents along this partonic cascade is reduced to a small value of order @xmath4 .",
    "when this happens , the fluctuation has _",
    "thermalized _ : the partons become a part of the thermal bath .",
    "a similar branching picture holds for the quanta emitted by a heavy quark which propagates with constant ( average ) velocity @xmath57 through the plasma @xcite .",
    "the virtual quanta with very high virtuality @xmath58 do not interact with the plasma and thus are reabsorbed by the quark : they are a part of its wavefunction .",
    "the low virtuality quanta with @xmath59 can decay under the action of the plasma force and thus initiate partonic cascades which eventually thermalize ( cf . fig .  [",
    "fig : quench ] right ) . as before",
    ", @xmath60 depends upon the energy @xmath61 of the emitted quanta , which in turn is constrained by @xmath62 , with @xmath63 ( since the quanta can not propagate faster than the heavy quark ) .",
    "the dissipation is controlled by the most energetic among the emitted quanta . by the previous arguments , these are the quanta with virtuality @xmath64 and with energy @xmath65 . the last condition together with @xmath66",
    "imply @xmath67 . by also recalling that it takes a time @xmath68 to emit a quanta with energy @xmath61 and virtuality @xmath3",
    ", we conclude that the rate for energy loss can be estimated as follows : @xmath69 the factor @xmath70 expresses the fact that , at strong coupling , the heavy quark radiates a large number of quanta , @xmath71 , in the time interval @xmath72 .    note",
    "that this mechanism for energy loss is different from the dominant respective mechanism as weak coupling . in both cases we can speak of medium  induced radiation .",
    "but the dynamics allowing for this radiation is different at weak coupling , where it involves medium rescattering ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : quench ] left ) , and respectively strong coupling , where it proceeds via medium  induced parton branching ( cf .",
    "[ fig : quench ] right ) . in both cases",
    ", this mechanism also provides a transverse momentum broadening . at weak coupling ,",
    "this has been estimated in eq .  .",
    "at strong coupling , this is generated by the random recoils associated with successive emissions , which are independent from each other .",
    "each such an emission gives a maximal recoil @xmath73 and their effects add in quadrature .",
    "this yields @xmath74 eqs .   and are consistent with the respective ads / cft results , as obtained from the trailing string @xcite . in these calculations",
    ", the saturation momentum @xmath75 appears as an induced horizon on the string world ",
    "sheet , at @xmath76 . in that context , the string fluctuations are generated as ` thermal noise ' at this induced horizon , with effective temperature @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the unruh effect in general relativity .",
    "so far , we have assumed the medium to be ` infinite ' ( meaning much larger than the formation time @xmath68 of a virtual quanta ) , but this is generally not the case in realistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "there a ` hard probe ' like the heavy quark is produced as a _",
    "parton via a hard scattering inside the medium .",
    "the time it takes that bare parton to dress itself with virtual quanta is generally larger ( at least for the softer quanta ) than the size @xmath44 of the medium .",
    "hence these quanta feel the effect of the plasma force @xmath51 over a time interval of order @xmath44 , and not @xmath78 .",
    "accordingly , the ` saturation ' condition ( mechanical work @xmath79 ) becomes @xmath80 . with this new expression for @xmath38 , the previous estimates for the rate for energy loss and momentum",
    "broadening become @xcite @xmath81 these equations imply @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which show an enhanced medium dependence ( by a factor @xmath84 ) as compared to the corresponding estimates at weak coupling @xcite ."
