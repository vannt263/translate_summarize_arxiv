    "<S> the inclusion of running coupling effects in the bk - jimwlk evolution equations considerably reduces the energy dependence of the saturation scale with respect to previous estimates based on fits to hera data . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how such slowdown affects the expectations for particle multiplicities in pb - pb collisions at lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> our prediction is based on the use of @xmath0-factorization and on the use of unintegrated gluon distributions taken from the numerical solutions of the bk equation with running coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a central value @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results from rhic @xcite strongly suggest that heavy ion collisions at high energies probe qcd in the non - linear regime characterized by strong coherent fields and gluon saturation , the color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , many bulk features of multiparticle production in rhic collisions , such as the energy , rapidity and centrality dependence of multiparticle production , are succesfully described by models based in cgc physics @xcite . with collision energies of up to @xmath2 tev , </S>",
    "<S> the upcoming program in lead - lead collisions at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is expected to provide confirmation for the tentative conclusions reached at rhic and to discriminate between the different physical mechanisms proposed to explain particle production in high energy nuclear reactions ( a review of predictions for heavy ion collisions at the lhc based on alternative approaches can be found in @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological models in @xcite rely on the assumption that the saturation scale @xmath3 that governs the onset of non - linear effects in the wave function of the colliding nuclei is perturbatively large @xmath4 gev at the highest rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> next , gluon production is calculated via the convolution of the nuclear unintegrated gluon distributions ( ugd s ) according to @xmath0-factorization @xcite . under the additional assumption of local parton - hadron duality </S>",
    "<S> , the pseudorapidity density of charged particles produced in a nucleus - nucleus collisions can be written as follows @xmath5 where @xmath6 denote the ugd s of projectile and target respectively , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the transverse momentum and rapidity of the produced particle , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 the impact parameter of the collision . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of impact parameter integration in this calculation and the gluon to charged hadron ratio are accounted for by the constant @xmath12 , which sets the normalization .    </S>",
    "<S> the second basic ingredient of cgc models is the one of saturation of the nuclear udg s entering using a relatively simple ansatz for the nuclear ugd s , and for symmetric collisions , the midrapidity multiplicity rises proportional to the nuclear saturation scale , which is assumed to grow as a power of the collision energy , @xmath13 : @xmath14 so far , the energy dependence of the saturation scale has been adjusted to the empirical value extracted from fits to dis hera data of saturation - based models@xcite , which yields @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this has been largely motivated by the inability of the leading - log bk - jimwlk evolution equations to reproduce experimental data . here </S>",
    "<S> discuss how the recent advances in the calculation of running coupling corrections to the bk - jimwlk evolution equations @xcite allow to compute the energy evolution of the ugd s from first principles , getting a good agreement with experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by solving the non - linear small-@xmath16 evolution equation for the dipole - nucleus scattering matrix , @xmath17 , including running coupling corrections @xcite : @xmath18-\\mathcal{s}\\left[s\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the dipole size and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expressions for the kernel terms in as well as a detailed explanation of the numerical method used to solve are given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the initial conditions for the evolution are taken from the mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we classify them according to their initial value of the saturation scale , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the saturation scale extracted from solutions of grows with energy significantly more slowly than the value extracted from empirical parametrizations of dis data , as shown in . on the other hand , the evolution speed @xmath22 turns out to be a function of @xmath23 , rather than a constant .     </S>",
    "<S> ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> right : evolution speed , @xmath24 , corresponding to the plot in the left . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the initial saturation scale is @xmath25 gev . </S>",
    "<S> , height=264 ]    we now use the exact solutions of to calculate particle multiplicities according to . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the nuclear udg s are now given in terms of the dipole scattering matrix evolved according to : @xmath26 the relation between the evolution variable in and feynman-@xmath16 of the produced particle is taken to be @xmath27 . since the relevant values of bjorken-@xmath16 probed at mid - rapidities and @xmath28 gev at rhic are estimated to be @xmath29 , the free parameter @xmath30 controls the extent of evolution undergone by the nuclear gluon densities resulting of prior to comparison with rhic data . </S>",
    "<S> similar to @xcite , large-@xmath16 effects have been modelled by replacing @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the running of the strong coupling in , evaluated according to the one loop qcd expression , is regularized in the infrared by freezing it to a constant value @xmath32 at small momenta . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in order to compare with experimental data it is necessary to correct the difference between rapidity , @xmath8 , and the experimentally measured pseudo - rapidity , @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by introducing an average hadron mass , @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the optimal value found in comparison with data , @xmath35 gev is in good quantitative agreement with the hadrochemical composition of particle production at rhic .    with this set up we find a remarkably good agreement with the pseudo - rapidity densities of charged particles measured in @xmath36 central au+au collisions at collision energies @xmath28 and 200 gev , as shown in . the comparison with data @xcite constrains the free parameters of the calculation to the ranges : @xmath37 gev , @xmath38 gev and @xmath39 . finally , the normalization constant is @xmath40 in all cases . </S>",
    "<S> the smallness of @xmath30 indicates that the nuclear udg s probed at rhic are in the _ pre - asymptotic _ </S>",
    "<S> regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> with all the free parameters now constrained by comparison to rhic data , the extrapolation to central pb - pb collisions at lhc energies , @xmath41 tev per nucleon , is straightforward and completely driven by the non - linear small - x dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath42 with a central value corresponding to the best fits to rhic data @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> these values are significantly smaller than those of other saturation based calculations @xcite , @xmath44 , and compatible with the ones based on studies of the fragmentation region @xcite , which yield @xmath45 .     and 200 gev and for pb - pb central collisions at @xmath46 tev . </S>",
