    "we report on collisionless ion temperature gradient ( itg ) instabilities with @xmath14 and adiabatic electrons .",
    "it will be shown that these instabilities can exist for relevant tokamak parameters .",
    "the physical mechanism of these instabilities will be shown to be related to the reduction of the effective drift frequency through the shift of the mode away from the low field side position .",
    "this mechanism is different from previously reported @xcite instabilities with @xmath0 , which are unstable only in a slab or for weak toroidicity .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section ii introduces the high @xmath6 itg through numerical simulation based on the gyro - kinetic model , section iii discusses the physics of the instability through the use of a simple fluid model .",
    "section iv discusses the relation with previously published work and , finally section v gives the conclusions .",
    "an example of a calculation using the ballooning transform @xcite ( the use of this transform is referred to below as the spectral case ) , obtained with the gyrokinetic code gkw @xcite , is given in fig .  1 by the dash - dotted curve that has a single maximum",
    ". the parameters of this , and all other simulations in this paper , are those of the waltz standard case @xcite : ion temperature gradient lengths @xmath15 density gradient length @xmath16 , electron and ion temperature @xmath17 , safety factor @xmath18 , magnetic shear @xmath19 , and inverse aspect ratio @xmath20 .",
    "the simulations use circular geometry retaining finite @xmath21 effects , and the flux tube approximation is always applied .",
    "however , gkw simulations with the radial direction described using finite differences ( simulations that use finite difference in the radial direction are referred to below as the non - spectral case ) show a surprisingly different behaviour for @xmath22 , displaying a spectrum with two maxima and having unstable modes with @xmath5 well above one , as is shown by the full line of fig .  1 .     in units @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the major radius of the magnetic axis ) as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "the dash - dotted ( blue ) line is the spectral case with @xmath26 , the full ( black ) line is the non - spectral case , and the dashed ( red ) line is the maximum growth rated obtained when varying @xmath27 in the spectral case.,width=340 ]    the essential difference between these two simulations is the number of radial modes that are kept in each of them .",

    "this suggests that the unstable modes for @xmath0 have a finite radial wave vector at the low field side position .",
    "it is well known , that a finite radial wave vector can be introduced in the ballooning transform through the introduction of the angle @xmath27 such that @xmath30 the growth rate as a function of @xmath27 for various values of @xmath5 is shown in fig .

    "it can be seen that for @xmath34 the low field side position is the position for which the maximum is reached , while it is shifted away from the low field side for @xmath0 .",
    "the physical reason for a maximum in @xmath52 can be understood as follows .",
    "the itg generates ion temperature perturbations due to the perturbed exb velocity in the background gradients ( the term proportional to @xmath40 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ deltat ] ) ) .",
    "since the drift ( @xmath46 ) is a function of the particle energy , the temperature perturbations generate density perturbations through the convection ( the term @xmath97 on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ deltan ] ) .",
    "these ion density perturbations then lead to the generation of the electric field ( eq .  ( [ poisson ] ) which is responsible for the perturbed exb velocity . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the convection due to the drift is zero and the mode is stable .",
    "one might therefore expect that a higher @xmath52 leads to a more unstable mode , and to some extent this is indeed the case , as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ growthrate ] ) which predicts @xmath99 .",
    "however , the eqs .",
    "( [ deltan],[deltat ] ) also contain terms that have a stabilising effect : the change in kinetic energy of the ions due to the drift motion in the perturbed potential ( the term @xmath100 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ deltat ] ) , the temperature perturbations that are generated by the perturbed density perturbations ( the term @xmath101 on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ deltat ] ) ) , and the fact that density and temperature perturbations have a tendency to propagate with different phase velocities .",
    "these stabilising terms are responsible for the threshold of the mode , and are all proportional to @xmath52 .",

    "the values of @xmath5 as well as the curve labels are the same as that of the fluid model in the left panel .",
    "[ kdep],width=340 ]    the fluid model is , of course , a strong simplification compared with the full gyro - kinetic model .",
    "the fluid model not only suggests that all instabilities close to the threshold would have their maximum growth rate away from the low field side , it also finds no threshold for the itg , since for any finite @xmath40 , @xmath52 can be chosen small enough that an instability arises .",
    "in particular the parallel dynamics ( landau damping ) contained in the gyro - kinetic model must be considered .",
    "this stabilising mechanism is independent of @xmath52 and can be expected to stabilise any instability for which @xmath52 is too small .",
    "nevertheless , if the explanation based on the fluid model is correct , its predictions should be qualitatively reproducible by the gyro - kinetic simulations .",
    "we discuss two tests below .",
    "first , we can artificially multiply the drift velocity with a factor @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , in spectral simulations with @xmath80 .",
    "this reduces the drift frequency and is as if we introduce the factor @xmath52 of the fluid model into the gyro - kinetic simulations ( with @xmath107 ) .",
    "for those modes that have a maximum growth rate when the mode is shifted away from the low field side , one expects the maximum growth rate for @xmath80 to be obtained for @xmath108 , if the physics mechanism discussed above is correct .",

    "[ kdep ] shows the growth rates of the gyro - kinetic simulations as a function of @xmath105 for the same values of @xmath5 as the fluid model ( shown in the left panel ) .",
    "indeed , the gyro - kinetic simulations at high @xmath5 are stable for @xmath109 and have a maximum in the growth rate for @xmath108 , qualitatively reproducing the fluid model .    second , as discussed above , the mechanism is not limited to @xmath0 .",
    "close to the threshold , the most unstable mode can be expected to be shifted away from the low field side ( provided the landau damping is small enough ) .",
