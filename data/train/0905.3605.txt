    "_ @xcite .    in an earlier paper @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the path of neutrino is important for the study of edr near a massive object .",
    "we have done a complete gr calculation of the neutrino path for the most general metric describing a rotating star , and obtained its geodesic equation along the equatorial and polar plane .",
    "the minimum photosphere radius ( mpr ) was calculated for various stars along these two planes .",
    "this is the starting point of our present calculation .",
    "the mpr serves as the lower limit from which we begin our calculation of the energy deposition rate ( edr ) during the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation to electron - positron pairs .",
    "our aim in this work is to study , semianalyticaly , the relativistic effect on the edr above the equatorial plane for a star rotating along the polar axis .",
    "we calculate the edr along the rotation axis for the neutrinos coming from the equatorial plane of the star .    the relativistic effect consists of three factors : the gravitational redshift , the bending of the neutrino trajectories and the redshift due to rotation .",
    "the edr is enhanced by the effect of neutrino bending ; however , the redshift due to disc rotation and gravitation reduces the edr .",
    "thus these effects further complicate the estimation of edr . in this work we primarily focus on the effect of gr and rotation on the edr .",
    "the neutrinos released during phase transition will have very high energy and will interact with the propagating medium . but",
    "first , let us calculate the edr only due to the thermal neutrinos , which have low energies and therefore high mean free path .",
    "this edr calculation will give us an estimate of the edr , and we will see how it compares with the energy liberated during gamma ray bursts ( grb ) . in order to discuss quantitatively the central engine of grbs , we need a comprehensive study of the formation , evolution , temperature dependence , geometry of the star , the mechanism of energy deposition etc . , most of which are affected by the rotational and gr effect .    our paper is arranged as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss our equations of state ( eos ) and describe the geometry of the star . in section iii",
    "we formulate the algorithm of the edr calculation above the equatorial plane along the rotation axis .",
    "next we present our results and finally we discuss the results and summarize our work .",
    "the structure of the star is described by the cst metric given by @xcite @xmath5 the four gravitational potentials , namely @xmath6 and @xmath7 are functions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 only .",
    "all the potentials have been solved for both static as well as rotating stars using the * rns * code @xcite . for a rotating star ,",
    "all the potentials become functions of both @xmath9 and @xmath8 .    tabulated equations of state ( eos ) are needed to run the code . in this paper",
    "we have used hadronic eos evaluated using the nonlinear walecka model @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian in the model includes nucleons ( neutrons and protons ) , electrons , isoscalar scalar , isoscalar vector and isovector vector mesons denoted by @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the lagrangian also includes cubic and quartic self interaction terms of the @xmath12 field .",
    "the parameters of the nonlinear walecka model are meson - baryon coupling constants , meson masses and the coefficient of the cubic and quartic self interaction of the @xmath12 mesons .",
    "the meson fields interact with the baryons through linear coupling .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath15 meson masses have been chosen to be their physical masses .",
    "the rest of the parameters , namely , nucleon - meson coupling constants and the coefficients of cubic and quartic terms of the @xmath12 meson self interaction are determined by fitting the nuclear matter saturation properties , namely , the binding energy / nucleon ( -16 mev ) , baryon density ( @xmath16=0.17 @xmath17 ) , symmetry energy coefficient ( 32.5 mev ) , landau mass ( 0.83 @xmath18 ) and nuclear matter incompressibility ( 300 mev ) .    using this tabulated eos and a fixed central density , we run the * rns * code to obtain all the gravitational potentials as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath8 , which thereby define the shape , mass , rotational velocity and other parameters of the star .",
    "the shape of a fast rotating neutron star becomes oblate spheroid @xcite .",
    "the star gets compressed along the z - axis , on the other hand along x and y - axes it bulges by equal amounts , thereby making the polar radius smaller than equatorial radius .",
    "in this section we study the gr effect on the neutrino pair annihilation rate .",
    "the coordinate system is oriented such that the equatorial plane lies along @xmath19 and the polar plane along @xmath20 .",
    "we treat the equatorial plane as a disk from which the neutrinos are coming out and depositing their energy along different radial points on the rotation axis . here",
    "we are interested in the edr via neutrino pair annihilation near the rotation axis , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown earlier @xcite that in the absence of gravitation the @xmath8 dependence of the edr is weak for small values of @xmath8 . although the @xmath8 dependence of the gravitational effect may not necessarily be small , here we calculate the edr at @xmath22 and assume it to be approximately the same for small values of @xmath8 .",
    "the energy deposited per unit volume per unit time is given as @xcite    @xmath23    where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the number density of neutrino ( antineutrino ) , @xmath26 is the neutrino velocity , and @xmath12 is the rest frame cross section for the process @xmath27 .",
    "the lorentz invariant term is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 sign is for electron neutrino - antineutrino pair and @xmath32 sign for other pairs .",
    "as the geometry of the equatorial plane is circular , we can decouple the energy and angular dependence .",
    "thus the rate of energy deposition is @xmath33    where , @xmath34 , the angular integral , is given by @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are explained later .",
    "we calculate the energy integral numerically , integrating it from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "both the angular and energy integrals have temperature dependence which is affected by the gr and rotational effects .",
    "@xmath40 is the effective temperature of the disc that is observed in the comoving frame .",
    "the value of @xmath41 is the temperature of the disc that is observed at infinity . in the locally nonrotating frame",
    "a neutrino moves normally to the direction of the disk motion . in that case",
    ", the temperature suffers redshift both due to disk rotation and gravitation .",
    "therefore the two temperature @xmath41 and @xmath40 are related @xcite , as @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 are calculated from the metric .",
    "@xmath45 is the lorentz factor defined as @xmath46 with @xmath47 being @xmath48 , @xmath49 the rotational velocity of the star .    in an earlier paper @xcite a detailed gr calculation of the neutrino path",
    "has been done . for the present coordinate system ,",
    "the 4- momentum @xcite is given by the equation , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the rest mass of the particle and @xmath52 , @xmath53 being the affine parameter .",
    "after a bit of algebra the final geodesic equation can be written as , @xmath54 ^ 2 \\frac{e^{(\\gamma - \\rho ) } r^2sin^2 \\theta}{e^{2\\alpha } } tan^2 \\theta_r [ \\omega ( 1-\\omega b)+\\frac{e^{2\\rho}b } { r^2sin^2\\theta}]^2 \\nonumber \\\\ - e^{(\\gamma + \\rho)}(1-\\omega b)^2 + \\frac{b^2}{r^2sin^2\\theta } e^{(\\gamma + 3\\rho ) } = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath55 is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the total energy and total angular momentum of the neutrino measured from infinity .",
    "this equation can be solved using the potentials obtained from * rns * code to obtain a minimum radius @xmath59 , the minimum photosphere radius , below which a massless particle ( neutrino ) emitted tangentially to the stellar surface ( @xmath60 ) would be gravitationally bound .",
    "this is also the minimum radius from which the neutrinos can come out from the disk .    from an angle @xmath61 at a point @xmath62 ( refer fig .",
    "1 ) , we can trace back a trajectory of the neutrino to its emission point on the disc .",
    "thus the temperature @xmath41 depends on @xmath61 , and therefore @xmath40 appears in the integration of @xmath61 in the angular integral .",
    "the neutrinos are coming out of the disk and depositing their energy along the rotation ( symmetry ) axis of the disk . the minimum radius from which the neutrinos can come out",
    "is given by mpr .",
    "the outermost point from which the neutrinos come out is the surface of the disc ( _ i .",
    "e. _ the surface of the star along the equatorial plane ) .",
    "figure 1 . shows the layout of our problem , where neutrinos coming out from the disk are depositing their energy along the rotation axis .",
    "neutrinos emitted from the disk at @xmath63 , arrive at point @xmath62 at the rotation axis .",
    "a neutrino coming from the mpr ( @xmath64 ) subtend angle @xmath65 with the rotation axis , the minimum value of @xmath61 and that coming from the outer surface of the disk ( @xmath66 ) subtends angle @xmath37 , the maximum value of @xmath61 .",
    "the angle @xmath61 is defined as the angle between position vector @xmath9 and @xmath67 .",
    "the minimum and the maximum angles are given by @xmath68 and @xmath69    the edr is now calculated by integrating @xmath70 over the proper volume .",
    "we calculate the amount of energy deposited along the rotation axis within an angular opening of about ten degrees @xcite .",
    "the point on the rotation axis from where we start our calculation is @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the edr is given by @xmath72 the integration is done over radial bin of @xmath73 , * i.e. * @xmath74 , and an angular width of ten degree , * i.e. * @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the observed luminosity at infinity @xmath77 of the neutrino pairs annihilation is given by @xmath78l(r)\\ ] ] [ lumin_surface ] the neutrino luminosity at the mpr is @xmath79 [ lumin_mpr ] where @xmath80 is the radiation constant .    in general the total neutrino luminosity",
    "will depend on the neutrino emissivity and can be evaluated with the volume integral of angle averaged neutrino emissivity @xcite . since some of the neutrinos will be depositing their energy in @xmath3 pairs , the total emissivity and hence neutrino luminosity will decrease accordingly .",
    "one should also consider the actual number of neutrinos trapped , the number of which will depend on the neutrino energy , matter density and temperature . in eqn.[14 ] we have considered only the total luminosity as observed due to the red - shift in temperature .",
    "moreover , eqn . [ 15 ] is valid for the case where neutrino chemical potential inside mpr is small enough compared to the temperature .",
    "hence , the above values of luminosity , given by eqns .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 15 ) will provide with a lower limit .",
    "we consider a ns which is of the order of a minute old .",
    "the average neutrino energy is of the order of few @xmath81 , and the neutrino mean free path is of the order of the radius of the star @xcite .",
    "we start our calculation with three different central temperature , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we consider the neutrinos comes out from the disk beyond the mpr ( which is @xmath85 ) . at this distance",
    "the star is much less dense than the central part , actually if the central density is @xmath86 times the nuclear saturation density , the density at mpr is less than @xmath87 times nuclear matter saturation density . in our problem",
    "we are considering only the thermal neutrinos . following the prescription given in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mean free path of the neutrinos with such energy and the given density is of the order of kilometers .",
    "other calculations @xcite do not alter the result much and the mean free path of the neutrinos for density and temperature of the star considered in the present study remains of the order of kilometers .",
    "therefore the neutrinos can travel quite a distance within the star and deposit their energy along the rotation axis .",
    "we choose the central density of the star to be @xmath88 , for which the keplerian velocity is @xmath89 . for comparison",
    "we have also done the calculation for a slow star ( @xmath90 ) . for the keplerian star the equatorial radius is @xmath91 , which serves as the outermost point of the disk . the innermost point from which the neutrinos can contribute in the edr",
    "is the mpr , which is @xmath92 from the center .",
    "the same two points for the slowly rotating star are @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively @xcite .    before discussing our results",
    ", we would like to mention that our present approach is a simplification of the actual scenario and the effect of neutrino inside ns may be more complicated .",
    "the trapping of neutrino inside the mpr may result in a change in the temperature profile as well as structure of the ns .",
    "for example , during the neutrino cooling period , the external layer near the mpr , where the neutrino trapping reaches highest efficiency , temperature may become higher than the temperature in the inner layers .",
    "this effect will then lead to an inflow of heat to the interior through some processes @xcite .",
    "this could then influence the internal structure of the ns .",
    "it has also been found @xcite that the presence of neutrino changes the composition of matter significantly with respect to the neutrino free case ; matter becomes more proton reach and hyperons appear at higher densities .",
    "since the presence of hyperons softnes the eos , in presence of neutrino trapping eos will become stiffer .",
    "in general the neutrino mean free path decreases with temperature ( at fixed density ) and density ( for fixed temperature)@xcite .",
    "so the high neutrino trapping and hence the increase in the temperature near the mpr will result in the decrease in the mean free path thereby changing the temperature profile of the star @xcite .",
    "the emissivity ( energy emitted per unit volume per unit time)may be taken to be proportional to @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xcite , @xmath97 being the baryon density .",
    "this is the amount of energy ( per unit volume per unit time ) deposited in the matter , if all the neutrinos are trapped . for a nonrotating spherical ns , made up of nucleons",
    "only , the density @xmath97 may be taken to be proportional to @xmath98 , @xmath9 being the radius of the star .",
    "hence the emissivity varies as @xmath99 .",
    "if we assume all the energy deposited goes into thermal energy , then temperature due to this deposition will also vary as @xmath99 .",
    "so there will be a temperature gradient ( tg ) of @xmath99 along the disk in the persent problem .",
    "since a rotating star changes its shape and becomes an oblate spheroid , the density and hence the temperature variation may change accordingly .    here",
    "we first assume an isothermal disk , _",
    "i.e. _ there is no tg along the disk .",
    "figure 2 shows the variation of the edr along the rotation axis of the star for three different temperatures ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath84 ) .",
    "the neutrino mean energy is in the range between @xmath102 .",
    "initially the edr increases with distance and it reaches a maximum value at a distance of @xmath91 and after that it falls off gradually .",
    "the edr is maximum for central temperature @xmath103 and minimum for @xmath104 , which shows that the edr increases with increase in temperature of the disk . for @xmath103",
    "the maximum edr is at a point about @xmath91 and the value of edr is @xmath105 , and the total energy deposited per second in the vicinity of the star ( calculated by integrating edr ) is of the order of @xmath106 .",
    "if we further increase the temperature to @xmath107 the total energy deposited per second near the star is of the order of @xmath108 , close to that of the energy liberated during grbs . at this temperature",
    "the observed luminosity @xmath77 is of the order of the edr .",
    "this implies that the neutrino becomes optically thick for the pairs annihilation . for @xmath109",
    "the edr is @xmath110 percent of the neutrino luminosity ( @xmath77 is @xmath111 ) .",
    "let us try to understand the peculiar nature of initial increase in edr with distance . from figure 3 , for the isothermal disk the temperature @xmath41 , seen by an observer at infinity , increases as the distance from the star increases",
    ". in this case @xmath41 becomes hotter with distance and therefore it approaches @xmath40 ( equal to @xmath112 for isothermal disk ) at large distance . as the disk is isothermal everywhere along the disk",
    "its temperature is constant . at close distance from the center of the disk along the rotation axis",
    "the contribution from the the inner part of the disk is greater and at larger distance the contribution is mostly from the outer part of the disk .",
    "this does not make any difference for the isothermal disk as all along the disk the temperature is constant .",
    "as we go to a larger distance the gr effect reduces and @xmath41 approaches @xmath40 .",
    "but for the disk with tg , @xmath41 will decrease with distance , unlike the above isothermal case .",
    "this is because as we go to a larger distance along the rotation axis the contribution from the outer part of the disk will dominate .",
    "for the disk with tg as we move outward along the disk its temperature decreases rapidly and is much smaller than the central temperature .",
    "although at a large distance gr effect will become less , @xmath41 will still decrease as here the temperature contribution comes mainly from the outer surface of the disk which is at a much lower temperature .",
    "looking at figure 4 , for the isothermal disk , we see that @xmath113 ( eqn . [ fr ] ) decreases with distance and falls to zero after @xmath114 . for the disk with temperature gradient",
    "we see that @xmath113 initially increases and after about @xmath115 it starts to fall , unlike the isothermal case where it decreases throughout .    for an isothermal disk ,",
    "initially the temperature dominates and edr increases but after some distance ( where @xmath113 decreases but temperature increases ) @xmath113 becomes the dominating factor and the edr decreases .",
    "the disk temperature observed at infinity is higher at outer region and the edr increases with temperature . on the other hand",
    "the doppler effect due to disk rotation reduces the edr .",
    "the edr calculated non relativistically at the mpr is half that of the relativistic case @xcite .",
    "the edr via neutrino pair annihilation is strongly dependent on disk temperature .",
    "therefore let us calculate the pair annihilation of neutrinos emitted from the disk with tg .",
    "as discussed previously one of the other extreme case will be the disk with @xmath116 ( @xmath117 is the radial distance along the disk ) .",
    "for comparison we also plot curves with @xmath118 . due to variation of disk temperature , the temperature at the mpr",
    "( initial temperature from which our calculation starts ) is much less than that of the central temperature . for @xmath109 and @xmath116",
    "the @xmath41 at mpr is less than @xmath119 and the temperature falls very rapidly and reaches negligible values beyond @xmath120 .",
    "the case of @xmath121 the situation is not so pessimistic .",
    "for the hotter star ( @xmath122 ) , @xmath41 at the mpr is above @xmath123 and does not fall to zero at large distances .",
    "figure 5 shows the variation of edr , for disk with tg , along the rotation axis of the star for two different central temperatures @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for @xmath109 with @xmath124 ( surface temperature is @xmath125 )",
    ", the initial value of edr is @xmath126 and it falls very sharply to zero at a distance of @xmath120 .",
    "the total edr is near to @xmath127 .",
    "the disadvantage of the tg disk is that the edr is @xmath0 percent of the neutrino luminosity ( @xmath128 ) , thereby again imposing the problem of neutrino opacity and also the baryon contamination problem @xcite .",
    "for @xmath129 the fall is even sharper .",
    "for @xmath121 the fall in edr is much slower and near the mpr the edr , for central temperature @xmath109 ( surface temperature is @xmath119 ) , is of the order of @xmath130 .",
    "for the colder disk the initial edr is much smaller .",
    "these curves show that the edr is very sensitive to temperature as well as to tg . at smaller @xmath9 , temperature is the governing factor in determining the nature of edr , therefore edr decreases .",
    "as @xmath9 increases , @xmath113 , which strongly decreases with @xmath9 , becomes the dominant factor and edr decreases further .",
    "hence , here the edr falls off much faster than the isothermal case .    the value of edr increases if we go inwards from the mpr .",
    "if we go close towards the center , the edr increases due to the increase in temperature of the disk . near the center",
    "the value of edr for non relativistic calculation and that with gr effect along with tg becomes the same .",
    "but as we go outwards the value of the edr for the gr calculation becomes less than the non - relativistic case .",
    "this is because , for gr calculation , the disk temperature falls as we go outwards along the disk .",
    "the slowly rotating star has a much smaller disk ( smaller equatorial plane ) and its mpr is @xmath94 , larger than the keplerian star .",
    "figure 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 depicts the various aspects of edr for a slowly rotating star .",
    "the gross nature of the edr is more or less same , but the value of maximum edr is slightly larger .",
    "the temperature plot is about the same , but the nature of @xmath113 is slightly different , the maximum value of @xmath113 being slightly larger . due to this reason the edr for the slow star is greater ( twice ) than that for the keplerian star .",
    "the rotational velocity seems to have some negative effect on the edr and as the rotational velocity increases the edr decreases .",
    "the other important conclusion from the above discussion is that the isothermal disk is more advantageous while considering the opacity and baryon contamination problem ( as for isothermal disk the ratio of edr on @xmath77 is minimum ) .",
    "in this article we have investigated the gr effect on the edr of @xmath27 reaction in a rotating neutron star described by cst metric .",
    "here we have calculated the edr for the neutrinos coming out of the equatorial disk and depositing energy along the rotation axis of the star , above the equatorial plane .",
    "the bending of the neutrino trajectories , and the redshift due to disk rotation along with gravitation has been taken into consideration .",
    "we find that for an isothermal disk , initially the edr increases with distance and reaches a maximum value and then decreases with distance .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is a competition between the temperature and the doppler effect due to disk rotation ( characterized by @xmath113 ) .",
    "the temperature observed by the observer at infinity ( @xmath41 ) increases and at large distance becomes same as that of the effective temperature ( @xmath40 ) whereas @xmath113 decreases with increase in distance from the disk . in the case of disk with tg",
    ", the edr falls off very quickly with distance . for @xmath116",
    "the slope with which edr falls is much greater than that for @xmath121 .",
    "the @xmath113 increases initially but it also decreases after some distance and falls very near to zero at about @xmath120 .",
    "both the isothermal and tg picture shows that the edr is a very sensitive function of temperature , and as temperature decreases the edr also decreases .",
    "we also conclude that the isothermal disk is more advantageous in avoiding opacity and baryon contamination problem .",
    "the slow star shows more or less the same nature except for the fact that edr for the slow star is about twice that for the keplerian star .",
    "the rotational effect reduces the edr .",
    "the method in which the angular integral is calculated is somewhat similar to that mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper , the authors had calculated the energy deposition due to neutrino - antineutrino annihilation above a black hole .",
    "the kerr metric describes the black hole , which is flat disk , and the neutrinos emitted from the disk contribute to the deposited energy .",
    "the calculation of the energy integral is different in our case and the star is at much lower temperature . in our discussion",
    "the neutrino are emitted from the equatorial plane of the star , which is a circular disk , and deposit their energy along the rotation axis of the star ( described in fig .",
    "1 ) . the innermost point from which the neutrino contribute is the mpr and the outermost point is the star surface .",
    "we have calculated the edr for the neutrinos coming out from the equatorial plane .",
    "if we consider the star to be spherical , the total edr for the entire star can be obtained multiplying the edr calculated for the equatorial plane by @xmath131 , for which the edr comes out to be of the order of @xmath132 . if we consider long duration grb this edr is quite close to that of the energy liberated during the grb ( @xmath133 ) .    to summarize",
    ", we find that the edr is very sensitive both to the temperature and tg of the disk . the deposition energy is contributed mainly by the neutrinos arriving from the central region where the temperature is higher .",
    "the maximum energy is deposited near the surface .",
    "as we move outwards the deposition energy reduces and is smaller than that of the non relativistic calculation .",
    "the maximum amount of energy deposited for an isothermal disk is few times @xmath134 , within a small angle .",
    "the isothermal disk is the most advantageous while avoiding opacity and baryon contamination problem . taking the disk to be isothermal",
    "a rough estimate of a spherical star provides edr quite close to that of the energy liberated during a long duration grb . the total energy deposition from a rotating neutron star",
    "would also depend on the off - axis contributions , but expected that most of the contribution will be along the rotation axis ( if it coincides with the magnetic poles ) , as the particles comes out of the star along the magnetic poles .",
    "the high energy neutrinos created during phase transition may further change the edr . to get an estimate of the total energy deposition",
    ", one needs to do a detailed numerical simulation taking into account all possible contributions .",
    "such a calculation is in progress and we hope to report it in the near future .",
