    "the presented nanoelectromechanical system is depicted in fig.[fig : setup ] and consists of a doubly clamped silicon nitride nanomechanical string resonator coupled to a @xmath63 microwave cavity via two adjacent gold electrodes@xcite .",
    "the 55 m long , 270 nm wide and 100 nm thick mechanical resonator of rectangular cross section exhibits two fundamental flexural modes with orthogonal polarizations either in - plane ( in ) or out - of - plane ( out ) with respect to the sample plane .",
    "the fabrication induced tensile pre - stress of 1.46gpa translates to a high unloaded quality factor of @xmath64 at a resonance frequency of @xmath4mhz for the fundamental out - of - plane flexural mode .",
    "the flexural in - plane mode exhibits an approximately 150khz higher fundamental resonance due to the rectangular cross section of the string resonator .",
    "a microwave bypass@xcite allows for the application of rf voltages and enables at the same time control of the inhomogeneous electrical field between the gold electrodes and hence the field gradient by a dc voltage .",
    "the applied dc voltage induces electric dipoles in the dielectric silicon nitride string resonator which couple in turn to the electric field gradient , hence resulting in a quadratic tuning of the mechanical frequencies with dc voltage@xcite .",
    "due to careful engineering of the vertical off - set between the electrodes and the mechanical resonator , we find the in - plane polarized oscillation to decrease quadratically in resonance frequency with the applied dc voltage whereas the out - of - plane polarized mode increases quadratically in frequency . at a dc voltage of approximately @xmath65v the inherent frequency off - set between the two modes is compensated and we resolve a clear avoided level crossing between the two frequency branches . the strong coupling between the two fundamental flexural modes is mediated by the inhomogeneous electric field in terms of non - vanishing cross derivatives of the electric field energy@xcite as detailed in section[sec : coupling ] .",
    "in order to drive the mechanical oscillation , a rf drive tone is added to the dc voltage using a bias tee .",
    "the oscillation of the nanomechanical resonator is detected in a microwave cavity assisted heterodyne in - phase quadrature mixing technique@xcite .",
    "hereby , the oscillation of the dielectric silicon nitride string resonator periodically modulates the capacitance of the gold electrodes , generating sidebands in the microwave cavity signal .",

    "a microwave bypass enables applying a dc tuning voltage and a drive tone combined at a bias tee . the sinusoidal drive tone for the parametric drive at @xmath8",
    "is provided by an arbitrary function generator . ]",
    "the strong coupling of the two nanomechanical flexural modes is provided by the inhomogeneous electric field in between the two gold electrodes .",
    "the coupling strength is equivalent to the frequency splitting of the two normal modes at the avoided crossing and can be expressed as@xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the spring constant of the normal modes and @xmath71 is an asymmetric coupling spring .",
    "the coupling spring constant is determined by the cross derivatives of the electric energy @xmath72 with respect to the out - of - plane ( z - direction ) and the in - plane ( y - direction ) oscillation of the nanomechanical string@xcite @xmath73 here , @xmath74 is the polarizability of the silicon nitride string as determined from the electric force acting on it in dipole approximation @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the electric dipole moment . +",
    "as stated in the main text , the coupling strength of the two modes decreases with increasing drive power of the strong parametric drive .",
    "in fig.[coupling ] we display the coupling strength extracted from the avoided crossings of the two modes prior to each measurement at different drive powers @xmath77 .",
    "note that we started the measurements at a parametric drive power of @xmath6dbm and systematically increased the drive power up to @xmath7dbm in steps of @xmath78dbm .",
    "coupling strength as extracted from the avoided crossing frequency splitting for each particular drive power @xmath77 ( blue dots ) .",
    "the red triangle corresponds to the coupling strength in the measurement of fig.1 of the main text at a drive power @xmath14dbm .",
    "the open circles indicate the datasets displayed in fig.2 and fig.3 of the main text , respectively . ]",
    "we observe a non - reversible , monotonous decrease of the coupling strength as a function of the parametric drive power .",
    "however , the coupling does not decrease in a clear functional way .",
    "up to a drive power of @xmath79dbm , one may qualitatively extract a linear relation between coupling strength decrease and the logarithmically increasing drive power . for larger drive powers , the decrease does not qualitatively follow a simple function . + in addition , the coupling strength also decreases if the strongly parametrically driven measurement is repeated at a specific drive power . as can be seen from fig.[coupling ] , the red triangle , which corresponds to @xmath14dbm , depicts a smaller coupling than the blue dot at @xmath80dbm since this data point was taken after multiple measurements in the region of @xmath81dbm@xmath82@xmath83dbm .",
    "obviously , strong parametric driving of the two coupled modes results in a non - reversible decrease of the electrically mediated coupling .",
    "surprisingly , the effect can be completely repealed by the exposition of the sample to air .",
    "after venting the vacuum chamber and subsequent evacuation of the chamber back to the operation pressure , we reversibly recover the initial electrically mediated coupling strength of the two nanomechanical modes .",
    "+ one possible explanation of this effect may be the implantation of static dipoles in the silicon nitride string due to the high electric fields the dielectric material is exposed to under the strong parametric drive .",
    "static dipoles in the material would decrease the polarizability of the silicon nitride string and hence reduce the electric coupling spring according to eq .. when exposed to air , the material would recover from the static dipoles due to charge exchange with the surrounding air molecules .",
    "however , the proposed mechanism does apparently not apply straightforwardly to the decrease of the coupling for repeated measurements at a fixed parametric drive power . in a lumped model",
    ", one could argue that large oscillation amplitudes of the dielectric string in combination with the high electric fields result in a big electric field gradient , which , in turn , favors the implantation of static dipoles in the material . in the case of the injection",
    "locked state , we expect mechanical amplitudes of tens of nanometers from the signal heights in the frequency spectra compared to the signal heights of the resonantly driven modes in the linear regime ( typical amplitudes of few hundred picometers ) . the exact origin of the decreasing mode coupling is currently under investigation and remains subject of future research .",
    "the adler equation@xcite describes the temporal evolution of the frequency and the phase of an oscillator which is impressed with an external signal of similar fundamental frequency .",
    "the solutions to this differential equation are periodic waves with a frequency off - set from the injected signal by@xcite @xmath84 as defined in the main text , @xmath57 and @xmath52 are the frequencies of the free - running oscillator and the injected signal , @xmath85 is the mechanical quality factor and @xmath56 and @xmath55 denote the amplitude of the oscillator and the injected signal , respectively .",
    "note that eq",
    ".   considers only a single mode subject to the parametric drive .",
    "since the signal and idler resonances are in the present experiment symmetrically off - set from the injected signal , it is well justified to consider one of the two resonances exemplarily .",
    "+ if the argument of the square root in eq",
    ".   becomes negative , i.e. , @xmath86 the free - running oscillator locks to the external signal .",
    "hence , the real part of eq .   becomes zero , which is the frequency off - set from the injected frequency .",
    "frequency off - set @xmath87 extracted from fig.3(b ) of the main text as a function of dc voltage ( blue dots ) .",
    "the red line is the fit of the real part of eq .   using one open parameter . ]    in fig.[adler ] , we plot the frequency difference of the parametric oscillation resonance @xmath17 from half of the drive frequency @xmath88 extracted from fig.3(b ) .",
    "note that the missing data points correspond to the regions where the system behaves chaotically . in order to fit eq .   to the experimental data with a single fit parameter",
    ", we apply several assumptions and simplifications .",
    "first , we linearize the frequency tuning of the fundamental free - running oscillation supposing @xmath89 in the vicinity of the avoided crossing and extract a linear tuning coefficient @xmath90khz / v .",
    "second , the mechanical quality factor is fixed at a value of @xmath91 which is a reasonable value for the employed dc voltage range@xcite .",

    "the fit of eq .   is displayed as red line in fig.[adler ] from which we obtain @xmath93 , where the provided error corresponds to the confidence interval of the fit .",
    "as expected , the quantitative agreement of the experimental data and the fit is rather poor due to the drastic approximations and the missing data points in the chaotic regions .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamics of the system qualitatively follow the theoretically predicted locking phenomena .",

    "<S> a comparison of the data provided in fig.[fig3 ] to the model of adler@xcite is carried out in the supplemental material@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion , we investigated the dynamics of two strongly coupled , high quality factor nanomechanical resonator modes in the region of their avoided crossing subject to a common parametric drive . depending on the driving strength and the frequency spacing of the two modes , we observed signal - idler generation via parametric oscillation in combination with satellite resonances at their beat - note frequency , partial injection locking and two - mode injection pulling , as well as complete injection locking of the two coupled modes to the common drive frequency . by tuning the resonance frequency separation of the two - mode parametric oscillation </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrated control of the nanomechanical signal - idler pair in all examined parametric driving regimes which opens up the path towards parametric control in multimode - nanoelectromechanics . </S>",
    "<S> for strong parametric driving , we have been able to completely injection lock the two - mode system to the external parametric pump , a state of extremely narrow mechanical linewidth and high amplitude which is highly stable against perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> + in future experiments , the presented scheme will be extended in order to study the implications of synchronization of the two strongly coupled modes . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting prospect of the presented scheme is the study of mechanical entanglement@xcite by the parametric degenerate drive . </S>",
    "<S> however , this would imply an increase in the mode frequencies to reduce the phonon occupation down to a quantum state as well as drastic improvements of the detection principle towards a quantum back - action - evading measurement@xcite .    financial support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft via the collaborative research center sfb 767 is gratefully acknowledged . </S>",
