    "the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite has become a well - established and valuable method to investigate the physics of strongly correlated electrons on a lattice .",
    "similar as the weiss mean - field theory for classical models of localized spins , the dmft is exact in the non - trivial limit of infinite spatial dimensions . @xcite for finite dimensions it provides a thermodynamically consistent and non - perturbative mean - field approach in which the spatial correlations are neglected but the temporal degrees of freedom are treated correctly .",
    "the application of the dmft to the single - band hubbard model @xcite has uncovered a complex phenomenology which may be characterized by strongly renormalized fermi - liquid behavior competing with the mott insulating state and with different kinds of spontaneous order such as collective magnetism .",
    "@xcite    the dmft actually consists in a prescription that maps the original lattice model onto an effective impurity model which describes a single correlated impurity orbital embedded in an uncorrelated bath of conduction - band states .",
    "this mapping is a self - consistent one , namely the bath parameters depend on the on - site lattice green function .",
    "the impurity model is the crucial point in the dmft since it poses a highly non - trivial many - body problem that must be solved repeatedly .",
    "the different methods employed for an essentially exact solution of the impurity model , the quantum monte - carlo , @xcite the exact diagonalization @xcite and the numerical renormalization - group method , @xcite work well for the single - band hubbard model but are computationally expensive . in practice",
    "this severely limits the applicability of the dmft , particularly when one is concerned with multi - band models .",
    "more complex lattice models including two , three or more degenerate or non - degenerate @xmath0-like bands possibly hybridized with uncorrelated @xmath1-@xmath2-like bands are interesting for obvious reasons .",
    "for example , multi - band models are required for a minimum theory of the physics of strongly correlated electrons in the transition - metal oxides . because of the large parameter space and the complexity of the effective impurity problem , a detailed and systematic calculation of the phase diagrams of multi - band models covering the entire parameter space is far beyond the ability of present implementations of the dmft .",
    "if one is interested in a comprehensive mean - field description of complex lattice models but wishes to keep the essence of the dmft , some compromise is inevitable . in principle , there are only two possibilities conceivable : first , one may refrain from a numerically exact solution of the impurity problem and employ approximate treatments instead .",
    "these may be based on different limits where a small parameter is available .",
    "this idea has been pursued with weak- and strong - coupling perturbational approaches such as the iterative perturbation theory @xcite or the non - crossing approximation .",
    "@xcite in fact , multi - band hubbard - type models can be treated in this way with an acceptable computing time ( see refs .  , for examples ) .",
    "this route , however , shall not be followed up here .",
    "the present paper takes into consideration the only alternative left , namely to solve the impurity model exactly but to reduce the number of bath degrees of freedom to keep the calculations manageable .",
    "there are no problems to treat e.  g.  the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) with a small number of sites @xmath3 numerically exact . on the other hand , for any finite @xmath4 the self - consistent mapping of the hubbard model onto the siam is approximate .",
    "the exact solution of the effective impurity model is thus achieved at the expense of an approximate self - consistency .    as a function of @xmath3",
    "the hilbert - space dimension @xmath5 of the impurity model increases exponentially .",
    "it is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of ( two - fold spin - degenerate ) one - particle orbitals .",
    "the self - consistent mapping within the dmft at least requires @xmath8 orbitals for the case of one impurity site , @xmath9 bath sites , and @xmath10 correlated bands ( see appendix ) .",
    "consider , for example , the @xmath0-band of a @xmath11 transition metal with a two - fold degenerate @xmath12-derived band and a three - fold degenerate @xmath13-derived band . in this case",
    "@xmath14 orbitals have to be considered . accepting @xmath15 as a typical value for the maximum number of orbitals that can be taken into account for a repeated solution of the impurity model within a reasonable computing time , limits @xmath3 to the smallest number that is reasonable : @xmath16 , i.  e.  an impurity model with one impurity site and one bath site .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to test whether or not a two - site dmft could be a meaningful approach and to show up its strengths and limitations .",
    "there are mainly two tasks to be performed : first , it is necessary to specify the approximate self - consistent mapping .",
    "this means to find a sensible prescription how to fix the bath parameters of the impurity model  guided by the original self - consistency condition of the dmft .",
    "second , the resulting two - site dmft has to be tested against the full dmft .",
    "this can be done best for the single - band hubbard model ( in infinite dimensions ) where numerous essentially exact results are available .",
    "thus , except for a short discussion of the extension of the theory to multi - band systems , the present paper is exclusively concerned with the single - band model .",
    "since one can not expect a strongly simplified two - site approach to reproduce the known results quantitatively exact , the present study attaches importance to main trends , qualitative correctness and internal consistency . recall that even the full dmft can not be expected to give more than a qualitative ( mean - field ) description of the physics of transition - metal oxides .",
    "the two - site siam has been considered within the context of the dmft beforehand .",
    "lange @xcite discussed the two - site siam at half - filling to investigate renormalized versus unrenormalized perturbational approaches to the dmft of the mott transition .",
    "however , a self - consistent mapping of the hubbard model onto the two - site siam was not considered .",
    "bulla and potthoff @xcite developed a linearized dmft of the mott transition .",
    "the hubbard model at half - filling and at the critical interaction strength @xmath17 was self - consistently mapped onto the two - site siam resulting in a linear algebraic mean - field equation .",
    "the solution of the two - site siam is exact , the mapping is approximate .",
    "it was found that , compared with the full dmft , the linearized dmft gives fairly good analytical estimates for @xmath18 on different lattices .",
    "the theory , however , is restricted to the critical point .",
