    "in the last years great attention was devoted to the investigation of dense quark ( or baryonic ) matter .",
    "the interest is motivated by possible existence of quark matter inside compact stars or its creation at heavy ion collisions . in nature as well as in heavy ion collision experiments ,",
    "the quark matter densities are not high enough , so consideration of its properties is not possible in the framework of perturbation approximation of weak coupling qcd . usually , various effective theories such as nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , @xmath8-model etc .",
    "are more adequate for studying the qcd and quark matter phase diagram in this case . as a result , a variety of spatially non - uniform ( inhomogeneous ) quark matter phases related to chiral symmetry breaking , color superconductivity , and charged pion condensation phenomenon etc .",
    "were predicted ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) at rather low values of temperature and baryon density .",
    "the phenomenon of spatially non - uniform quark pairing was also intensively investigated within different ( 1 + 1)-dimensional toy models which can mimic qualitatively the qcd phase diagram . in this connection , it is necessary to mention the gross - neveu ( gn ) type models that are symmetrical with respect to the discrete and continuous chiral transformations and extended by inclusion of baryon and isospin chemical potentials . in the framework of these models both the inhomogeneous chiral @xcite and charged pion condensation phenomena",
    "were considered @xcite .",
    "( in order to overcome the no - go theorem for spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions , consideration there was performed in the large-@xmath9 approximation , where @xmath9 is the number of quark multiplets . )",
    "moreover , it is necessary to note that in some quasi - one - dimensional condensed matter systems , such as imbalanced fermi gases @xcite , etc . , there might exist different inhomogeneous phases .    among a variety of gn - type models",
    ", there is one which describes competition between quark - antiquark and diquark pairing @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the consideration is performed in the supposition that chiral and superconducting condensates are spatially homogeneous . in this case",
    "it was shown that if @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the coupling constants in the chiral and superconducting channels , respectively , then at rather high quark number chemical potential the superconducting phase is realized in the system .",
    "however , the condensates in the genuine ground state of the model may be inhomogeneous , and hence , the aim of our paper is to investigate such a possibility .",
    "namely , we study the phase structure of the extended model @xcite ( which is symmetric with respect to continuous chiral transformations ) , assuming that both quark - antiquark and diquark condensates might have a spatial inhomogeneity in the form of the fulde ",
    "ferrel single plane wave ansatz @xcite , for simplicity .",
    "as a result , we have shown that , in contrast to a homogeneous ansatz for condensates , at @xmath2 superconductivity is absent and only inhomogeneous chiral spiral ( or chiral density wave ) phase occurs at arbitrary @xmath10 ( for rather low temperature ) .",
    "our investigation is based on a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional njl@xmath11type model with massless fermions , or quarks , belonging to a fundamental multiplet of the @xmath12 flavor group .",

    "physically more interesting is that the model ( 1 ) is invariant under transformations from the @xmath22 quark number group : @xmath23 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "in addition , the lagrangian is invariant under the continuous group @xmath24 of chiral transformations : @xmath25 ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "thus , using the same rather tedious technique as in @xcite , it is possible to show that at arbitrary fixed @xmath188 the absolute minimum of the function ( [ 25 ] ) vs @xmath67 always occurs at @xmath70 .",
    "this means that in the framework of the ansatz ( [ 8 ] ) , the diquark condensate is always spatially homogeneous within the model ( 1 ) .",
    "now , taking into account this result , we suppose that @xmath70 in what follows .. ] as a consequence , in this case the unrenormalized tdp ( [ 11 ] ) looks like the expressions ( [ 12])-([14 ] ) in which @xmath1 should be replaced by @xmath189 , i.e. @xmath190 where @xmath191 in contrast to the tdp ( [ 14 ] ) of the previous section , the tdp ( [ 27 ] ) is a function of three variables , @xmath124 , @xmath53 and @xmath66 .",
    "since , in this case @xmath66 simply shifts effectively the chemical potential @xmath1 , one can consider the tdp ( [ 27 ] ) as a function of @xmath124 , @xmath53 and @xmath63 .",
    "clearly , without loss of generality one can study the expression ( [ 27 ] ) in the region @xmath192 , @xmath78 and @xmath193 .    to find a finite renormalized expression for the tdp ( [ 27 ] )",
    ", we should first regularize it and then perform a renormalization procedure in order to remove at @xmath85 the uv divergences by demanding an appropriate behavior of the bare coupling constants @xmath103 vs the cutoff parameter @xmath84 . in the case of spatially",
    "homogeneous condensates all regularization schemes are usually equivalent . however , in the case of spatially inhomogeneous condensates the translational invariance over one or several spatial coordinates is lost .",
    "so , the corresponding ( spatial ) momenta are not conserved .",
    "then , if one uses the momentum - cutoff regularization technique , as in the previous section , nonphysical ( spurious ) @xmath66-dependent terms appear , and the tdp acquires some non - physical properties such as unboundedness from below with respect to @xmath66 , etc . in order to obtain a physically reliable tdp ( or effective potential ) , in this case an additional substraction procedure",
    "is usually applied ( for details see in @xcite ) . on the other hand , if one uses more adequate regularization schemes such as schwinger proper - time @xcite or energy - cutoff regularizations @xcite , etc .",
    ", such spurious terms do not appear .",
    "should be used in a regularized thermodynamic potential . ]    in the present paper the slightly modified energy cutoff regularization scheme of @xcite is adopted .",
    "( see also @xcite , where a similar regularization was used in searching for both chiral density waves and inhomogeneous diquark condensate in some njl@xmath11 models . )",
    "namely , we require that only energies with momenta @xmath92 , constrained by the relations @xmath194 , contribute to the regularized thermodynamic potential .",
    "this means that the term with energy @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) in ( [ 27 ] ) should be integrated in the regularized expression for tdp over the interval @xmath197 ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "consequently , instead of ( [ 27 ] ) we have the following regularized tdp : @xmath199 the expression ( [ 34 ] ) can be presented in the following form : @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the tdp ( [ 15 ] ) with simple replacement @xmath202 . replacing in this formula @xmath103 by @xmath203 from (",
    "[ 18 ] ) and adding an unessential constant @xmath94 , we obtain in the limit @xmath98 the renormalized expression @xmath204 where @xmath205 and @xmath121 is given in ( [ 22 ] ) .",
    "note that the tdp ( [ 29 ] ) is formally equal to the renormalized tdp ( [ 24 ] ) of the homogeneous condensates case , in which one should simply perform the replacement @xmath202 . to obtain the last terms in ( [ 36 ] )",
    ", one should take into account that at @xmath85 the @xmath92-values in both integrals in ( [ 35 ] ) are much greater than @xmath206 . in this case",
    ", it is possible to expand the quantities @xmath207 into power series of @xmath92 and then to integrate each term .",
    "we add in the expression ( [ 36 ] ) an unessential @xmath66-independent term , -@xmath208 , in order to reproduce at @xmath69 the tdp ( [ 24 ] ) , corresponding to a spatially homogeneous chiral condensate .",
    "* phase structure at @xmath105 . * it is clear that to find the phase portrait of the model at @xmath105 , one should investigate the global minimum point ( gmp ) of the tdp @xmath209 ( [ 36 ] ) vs the dynamical variables @xmath188 .",
    "since in our case the variable @xmath66 is absorbed by the chemical potential , the tdp ( [ 36 ] ) is indeed a function of three variables @xmath210 .",
    "thus , searching for the gmp of this function consists effectively of two stages .",
    "first , one can find the extremum of this function over @xmath124 and @xmath53 ( taking into account the results of section [ mu ] ) , in the inhomogeneous case we did not find local minima of the tdp ( [ 36 ] ) in which both @xmath154 and @xmath211 . ] and then one minimizes the obtained expression over the variable @xmath212 . following this strategy , let us introduce the quantity @xmath213 now suppose that @xmath112 .",
    "taking into account the results of the investigation of the gmp of the tdp ( [ 24 ] ) ( see subsection [ mu ] ) , it is easy to see that at @xmath214 with @xmath129 given in ( [ 39 ] ) , the function @xmath209 is minimized at @xmath126 , @xmath153 ( recall , @xmath212 is fixed ) . in this case @xmath215 . however , at @xmath216 the minimum of @xmath209 is reached at @xmath217 .",
    "hence , in this case @xmath218 . therefore , the function ( [ 40 ] ) takes the form @xmath219 since for arbitrary fixed @xmath10 the minimum of the function ( [ 41 ] ) over the variable @xmath193 occurs at @xmath220 , i.e. at @xmath221 , we conclude that for arbitrary values of @xmath112 and @xmath10 the spatially inhomogeneous phase in the form of chiral spirals ( chiral density waves ) is more preferable than either of the two homogeneous phases , homogeneous chiral symmetry breaking phase or homogeneous phase with nonzero diquark condensate .    in the case of @xmath114",
    "the gmp of the tdp @xmath209 over two variables , @xmath124 and @xmath53 , lies at the point @xmath128 ( see subsection [ mu ] ) .",
    "hence , in this case @xmath218 , i.e. it does not depend on @xmath212 . as a result",
    ", we could take @xmath69 which corresponds to the homogeneous diquark condensation phase at arbitrary @xmath114 and @xmath10 values , i.e. the ( homogeneous ) superconductivity phenomenon can appear in the model only at @xmath222 . in the case",
    "@xmath223 , it is suppressed by inhomogeneous chiral density wave phase . in contrast , if the homogeneous ansatz for condensates is used ( see @xcite , as well as the previous section ) , then cooper pairing appears in the model at arbitrary @xmath223 starting from @xmath133 ( [ 39 ] ) .    * phase structure at @xmath68 . * in order to include the temperature into consideration , let us start from the unrenormalized expression ( [ 11 ] ) for the tdp .",
    "then at @xmath70 we have @xmath224 .",
    "\\label{42}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( obviously , the tdp ( [ 42 ] ) is equal to the expression ( [ 27 ] ) . ) to get the corresponding unrenormalized thermodynamic potential @xmath225 in the case of nonzero temperature , one again performs the standard replacements ( [ 430 ] ) in ( [ 42 ] ) .",
    "summing over matsubara frequencies in the obtained expression , one finds @xmath226[1+e^{-\\beta",
    "\\tilde e_-}]\\big\\}\\nonumber\\\\&=&\\omega^{un}(m , b,\\delta)-t\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{dp_1}{\\pi}\\ln\\big\\ { [ 1+e^{-\\beta \\tilde e_+}][1+e^{-\\beta \\tilde e_-}]\\big\\ } , \\label{1202}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 , @xmath207 are given in ( [ 28 ] ) , and @xmath227 is the unrenormalized tdp ( [ 27 ] ) at @xmath105 . since the last integral in ( [ 1202 ] ) is convergent , we should again renormalize the term @xmath227 using the same regularization scheme as above in this section ( see expression ( [ 34 ] ) for the corresponding regularized tdp ) , in order to obtain a finite renormalized tdp @xmath228 at nonzero temperature . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath229[1+e^{-\\beta \\tilde e_-}]\\big\\ } , \\label{43}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath209 is given in ( [ 36 ] ) .",
    "after numerical investigations of this tdp we obtain , e.g. , at @xmath151 the @xmath5-phase portrait in fig .",
    "it is clear from this figure that at rather low temperatures @xmath230 and arbitrary values of chemical potential , the chiral symmetry breaking phase with inhomogeneous condensate in the form of chiral spiral is arranged ( in fig .",
    "5 it is denoted as inhomogeneous chiral density wave ( icdw ) phase ) . in this phase @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and wave vector @xmath66 does not depend on @xmath0 and equals @xmath1 ( at each fixed value of @xmath1 the gap @xmath124 decreases in this phase continuously from @xmath96 to zero , when temperature varies from zero to @xmath231 ) .    if @xmath114 , then in the framework of the ansatz ( [ 8 ] ) we have not found any phase with nonzero values of @xmath66 and/or @xmath67 , so in this case the @xmath5-phase portrait of the model is the same as in fig .",
    "2 .    finally ,",
    "a few words about the particle density behavior as well as the density - temperature phase portrait of the model , when spatial inhomogeneity of condensates in the form of the ansatz ( [ 8 ] ) is allowed . in this case",
    "we denote the particle density of the model by @xmath232 , @xmath233 where the tdp @xmath228 is given in ( [ 43 ] ) and @xmath234 are the coordinates of its global minimum point .",
    "it is evident that in the symmetrical phase of the model , where @xmath235 , the particle density ( [ 01203 ] ) is equal to expression ( [ 1204 ] ) , i.e. @xmath236 .    in contrast , in the icdw phase ( see fig .",
    "5 ) we have @xmath237 , and @xmath160 ( the last quantity is a @xmath0-dependent one ) .",
    "so at @xmath221 the integral term of the expression ( [ 43 ] ) does not depend on @xmath1 and , hence , does not contribute to the particle density ( [ 01203 ] ) in the icdw phase .",
    "moreover , as it follows from the expressions ( [ 36 ] ) and ( [ 29 ] ) , in this case , i.e. at @xmath221 , the tdp @xmath209 in ( [ 43 ] ) can be presented in the form : @xmath238 , where we have omitted all the @xmath1-independent terms . as a result , it is easy to see from ( [ 01203 ] ) that inside of the icdw phase the particle density ( @xmath239 @xmath240 ) does not depend on @xmath0 and , furthermore , @xmath241 .",
    "it clear from this discussion that the particle density  temperature phase diagram of the model has a rather trivial form , when the inhomogeneity ansatz ( [ 8 ] ) for condensates is applied .",
    "indeed , one should take the @xmath5-phase portrait ( it is fig . 5 at @xmath112 or fig . 2 at @xmath114 ) and",
    "then simply rename the horizontal @xmath1-axis in favor of @xmath232-axis .",
    "it is clear from the above consideration that in the case of inhomogeneous condensates the critical temperature , at which there occurs a symmetry restoring phase transition , does not depend on @xmath1 and/or @xmath232 .",
    "however , it is a model dependent effect .",
    "indeed , in this paper we deal with the model ( 1 ) which is invariant with respect to @xmath24-chiral symmetry .",
    "in contrast , in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional model with @xmath242-chiral symmetry @xcite the temperature of a transition between chiral density wave- and symmetrical phases is a @xmath1-dependent quantity .",
    "moreover , in the last model the phase diagram has a more complicated form ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we have investigated the phase structure of the njl@xmath11-type model ( 1 ) in the framework of the fulde ",
    "ferrel single plane wave spatially non - uniform ansatz ( [ 8 ] ) both for chiral and superconducting condensates .",
    "the following results are obtained :      \\2 ) it is clear from fig .",
    "5 that in the case @xmath2 the inhomogeneous chiral condensate in the form of the so - called chiral density wave suppresses the appearance of the superconductivity at arbitrary values of @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , if chiral- and cooper condensates are assumed to be spatially uniform , then at sufficiently high @xmath1 the superconducting phase is allowed to exist in this case ( see fig . 1 and @xcite ) .",
    "\\3 ) if spatially inhomogeneous ansatz ( [ 8 ] ) for condensates is taken into account in the model ( 1 ) , then cooper pairing ( which is spatially homogeneous ) is possible only at sufficiently strong interaction in the quark - quark channel , i.e. at @xmath222 ( see fig .",
