    "a _ generalized baumslag  solitar group _ ( or gbs group ) is a group that acts on a tree with infinite cyclic edge and vertex stabilizers .",
    "the tree ( together with the group action ) is called a _",
    "gbs tree_. a gbs tree can be described by a _ labeled graph _ , which is a connected graph whose oriented edges are each labeled by a non - zero integer .",
    "this information is enough to specify a graph of groups encoding the gbs tree .",
    "a gbs group @xmath0 may have many labeled graph descriptions .",
    "even if one restricts to _ reduced _ labeled graphs , which are in some sense the simplest ones , there may be infinitely many distinct such graphs defining @xmath0 .",
    "it can also happen that there is only one reduced graph , or finitely many . in these latter cases , useful information about @xmath1",
    "can be obtained , as in gilbert ",
    "raptis @xcite , pettet @xcite , and levitt @xcite . other aspects of gbs groups have been studied by kropholler , whyte , levitt , and others .",
    "see kropholler @xcite , whyte @xcite , clay @xcite , and forester @xcite for details on various algebraic and geometric properties of gbs groups .",
    "the variety of labeled graph descriptions of gbs groups is partly what makes them interesting .",
    "for instance , they demonstrate the extent to which jsj decompositions of groups can fail to be unique . on the other hand",
    ", this variety can also be a source of difficulty , such as when studying automorphisms . a given labeled graph need not be invariant , for instance .",
    "even the basic problem of recognizing a given gbs group from one of its labeled graphs is not at all clear .",
    "the _ isomorphism problem _ for gbs groups is the problem of determining algorithmically whether two given labeled graphs define isomorphic gbs groups .",
    "this problem has only been shown to be solvable in limited special cases .",
    "it is trivially solvable for the _ rigid _ gbs groups , which are those having a unique reduced labeled graph .",
    "these groups were characterized by levitt @xcite ( see also gilbert et al .",
    "@xcite , pettet @xcite , and forester @xcite ) .",
    "levitt showed that the isomorphism problem is solvable in the case of gbs groups @xmath0 such that @xmath1 does not contain a non - abelian free group @xcite .",
    "he also solved the isomorphism problem for @xmath2generator gbs groups @xcite .",
    "both of these results rely on having an explicit characterization of the class of groups being considered .    in @xcite",
    "the isomorphism problem was solved for gbs groups whose modular groups contain no integers other than @xmath3 .",
    "equivalently ( see levitt @xcite ) these are the gbs groups not containing any solvable baumslag ",
    "solitar group @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "it is worth recalling the main steps of the proof .",
    "first it was shown that any two such graphs are related by slide moves , without leaving the set of reduced graphs .",
    "then it was shown that such a group is represented by only finitely many reduced labeled graphs .",
    "thus , this set can be searched and enumerated effectively , and membership is decidable .    for the general isomorphism problem , it is useful to understand the space of reduced labeled graphs related to a given one by sequences of slide moves .",
    "we want to know whether this space is infinite , and whether it includes all reduced labeled graphs for the given group .",
    "to this end , there is a property of edges that plays a key role : edges can be _ mobile _ or _ non - mobile _ ( see ) .",
    "one of our main technical results is , which shows that in any sequence of slide moves , the non - mobile edges may be slid first and one at a time . from this",
    "we deduce information on the slide space of a labeled graph , including our first main result :    [ th : finite ] let @xmath0 be a gbs group other than @xmath4 , represented by a reduced labeled graph @xmath6",
    ". then @xmath0 has finite reduced labeled graph space if and only if @xmath6 has no mobile edges .",
    "we also show that mobility of edges can be tested algorithmically ( ) , so the property of the theorem is decidable .",
    "( the case of @xmath4 is clear as well : the reduced labeled graph is unique if @xmath7 , and @xmath8 has two reduced labeled graphs . )",
    "one consequence of is , which solves the isomorphism problem in the case where one labeled graph has no mobile edges .",
    "next we consider the case of gbs groups whose labeled graphs have first betti number one . ( the betti number zero case is covered by forester @xcite . )",
    "the primary goal of the rest of the paper is the following theorem :    [ th : iso ] there is an algorithm which , given two labeled graphs , one of which has first betti number at most one , determines whether the two gbs groups are isomorphic .",
    "these are two cases , which behave rather differently : the ascending case and the non - ascending case . in the ascending case",
    ", there is a structure theorem ( ) which says that the group is uniquely determined by certain invariants , which can be computed by putting the labeled graph into a normal form .",
    "these invariants are defined and proved invariant with the aid of theorem 1.1 of clay ",
    "forester @xcite , which shows that any two reduced labeled graphs are related by slide , induction , and @xmath9moves between reduced labeled graphs ( see for the definitions of these moves ) .",
    "the non - ascending case is somewhat simpler , since any two reduced labeled graphs representing the same group are related by slide moves .",
    "( in particular , one may keep track of individual edges . ) however , even though we can define normal forms , they are much less rigid than in the ascending case . for instance , there is no canonical edge with which to compare other edges , unlike ascending normal forms .",
    "we show that given @xmath0 , there are only finitely many reduced labeled graphs in normal form , and these can be enumerated effectively .",
    "the solution to the isomorphism problem is then similar to the case proved in @xcite .",

    "a graph @xmath6 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the vertices , @xmath12 are the oriented edges , @xmath13 are the originating and terminal vertex maps and @xmath14 is a fixed point free involution , which reverses the orientations of edges . an _ edge path _",

    "there are two moves one can perform on a @xmath0tree without changing the elliptic subgroups , called _ collapse and expansion moves _ ; they correspond to the natural isomorphism @xmath26 .",

    "a group @xmath0 that acts on a tree with infinite cyclic stabilizers is called a _ generalized baumslag  solitar group _ ( or _ gbs group _ ) . in this paper , for simplicity , we also require @xmath0 to be finitely generated ( this convention is not followed in @xcite ) . the tree is called a _ gbs tree_. in the quotient graph of groups , every vertex and edge group is isomorphic to @xmath30 , and each inclusion map @xmath31 is given by multiplication by a non - zero integer .",

    "these operations are called _ admissible sign changes_. this is the only ambiguity in the labels of a labeled graph .",
    "we will sometimes refer to @xmath41 simply as @xmath6 .",
    "a @xmath0tree is _ elementary _ if there is a @xmath0invariant point or line , and is _ non - elementary _ otherwise . by forester (",
