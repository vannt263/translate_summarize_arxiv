    "in the present article the results of microscopic calculations for the high spin properties of the superdeformed ( sd ) rotational bands in the nucleus @xmath0 tb are presented .",
    "this nucleus is a direct neighbor of the `` doubly magic '' superdeformed nucleus @xmath2dy which is characterized by particularly large gaps in the neutron and proton deformed single - particle spectra .",
    "we investigate the rotational bands together with their microscopic structure in terms of the single - particle orbitals .",
    "the theoretical description of such properties , most often applied in the literature , is based on the average field approximation ( see ref.@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "most of the present knowledge about the nucleonic structure underlying the properties of the sd rotational bands comes from analyzing the single - particle routhians generated by making use of the rotating nilsson or deformed woods - saxon ( ws ) hamiltonians .",
    "the total nuclear energy as a function of spin is then obtained by using the strutinsky total energy expression ( see for example ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "similar analyses based on the hartree - fock ( hf)@xcite , or relativistic mean field ( rmf)@xcite approximations are more difficult and have not been , up to now , applied for global calculations , with the notable exception of ref.@xcite . however , they have an advantage of directly providing the total energy as a function of spin which can be compared with the experimental data . in the present work we apply and compare the ws and hf cranking approximations",
    ".    uncertainties in predictions coming from various models lead to ambiguities in the interpretation of the experimental results .",
    "the problem of a ( non-)uniqueness in the interpretation of the microscopic structure of sd bands is strongly aggravated by the fact that the spins of nearly all measured bands in question are not known .",
    "moreover , the nuclear interactions responsible for the single - particle level ordering in the strongly deformed nuclei are obtained mainly by extrapolating the properties of the interactions known from spherical and moderately deformed nuclei .",
    "direct tests of the structure of wave functions of the single - nucleonic orbitals ( via e.g.  magnetic moments ) are considered extremely difficult from the experimental point of view due to the very short life - times of the sd high - spin states .",
    "in such a situation we are confronted not only with the problem of a microscopic interpretation of the quickly growing body of the experimental information  but also with the problem of a cross - check analysis of theoretical predictions coming from distinct nuclear interactions used .",
    "it will be one of our objectives to provide such a test by comparing the microscopic properties calculated within the strutinsky and hf methods .    for a realization of our objective , the experimental knowledge of eight bands in one single sd nucleus , @xmath0 tb ,",
    "is extremely useful . at present",
    "there are only very few nuclei in which the number of known sd bands is comparable to that in @xmath0 tb .",
    "moreover , the transition energies of those bands behave regularly as functions of the angular momentum @xmath3 .",
    "such a regularity provides the optimal conditions for theoretical verifications of single - nucleonic configurations via the dynamical moments defined by @xmath4 this is so , because the abrupt band crossings ( relatively abundant in other nuclei ) may otherwise cause strong variations of @xmath1-moments as a function of @xmath5 , thus rendering the comparisons of the typical behavior ( and values ) of the @xmath1-moments with experiment less direct . in some cases",
    "the band crossings may play an important role in helping to identify some orbitals via the characteristic crossing frequencies .",
    "however , we found it preferable to first discuss the structural elements , such as the global behavior of the @xmath1-moments and their values , in relation with some characteristic nucleonic configurations .",
    "another group of problems related to the band crossings , crossing frequency systematics and alignments is left for future investigations .",
    "an advantage of basing the verification of the theoretical results with experiment on the @xmath1-moments is that this quantity does not depend on the exit spin ( the spin corresponding to the lowest observed transition in an sd band ) while many other quantities do .",
    "for this reason we intend to focus on the rotational frequency rather than spin as an independent variable in function of which several microscopically calculated quantities will be displayed .",
    "however , the question of the relative spins in the multi - band problem , or equivalently , of the relations between the exit spins in the bands observed , is one of the most urgent at present . for this reason",
    "a special section will be devoted to discussing the total energy vs. spin dependence , @xmath6 .",
    "let us mention here that , similarly to numerous other studies devoted to the interpretation of the intrinsic configurations of the sd bands , our work will not be able to give definite answers in several points .",
    "we feel , nevertheless , that our method allows to pin down relatively reliably at least the possible alternative interpretations of the bands in question .    while the lack of knowledge of the exit spins remains one of the most serious experimental problem ,",
    "many analyses of the sd nuclei have benefited from the strong similarities between various bands in various sd nuclei ( the `` identical band '' correlations , cf .",
    "ref.@xcite for a recent review ) . by comparing the theoretically predicted structures of the bands related by the `` identicality '' ( or `` sameness '' ) relations",
    ", it was possible to confirm or eliminate certain hypotheses related to the underlying single - nucleonic structure .",
    "this type of correlations are abundant in the @xmath0 tb nucleus and will be used to further test the microscopic results and predictions .",
    "it is expected that some amount of pairing correlations remains in the sd bands up to the highest spins measured and that the pairing correlations decrease with increasing angular momentum .",
    "although , as we will demonstrate it , in the @xmath0 tb nucleus the most important properties of the sd bands such as , e.g. , the behavior of the dynamical moments in function of the rotational frequency can be described reasonably well without taking into account the pairing , the systematic small discrepancies which exist , are increasing when the pairing correlations are taken into account .",
    "moreover , the arguments will be given demonstrating that at least in the case of some parametrizations of the nuclear interactions another source of small systematic deviations between theory and experiment may be attributed to slightly exaggerated nuclear volumes as calculated within the mean field approaches ( cf .",
    "sec.[sec5 ] for details ) .",
    "a number of structural features related to the high - spin behavior of the sd nuclei in the a@xmath7150 region have been discussed in the literature .",
    "early studies were based on the nilsson or ws cranking approaches , and performed without pairing@xcite or with the dynamic pairing correlation@xcite taken into account by using either the random phase approximation ( rpa ) or the particle number projection ( pnp ) together with the monopole pairing interaction . in most of those early studies the experimental information has been strongly limited , as compared to the amount of data available today . in more recent studies , the ws@xcite or the hartree - fock - bogolyubov (",
    "hfb)@xcite methods have been applied to a few low - lying bands in a number of selected a@xmath7150 nuclei with pairing correlations treated in terms of the lipkin - nogami method .",
    "the present study differs from the previously published ones in the following : ( i ) due to a rich experimental information available now , we can concentrate on systematic discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental data , ( ii ) we discuss the analogies and differences between the self - consistent ( hf ) and the non - self - consistent ( ws ) cranking approaches within the same analysis ( applied simultaneously on a common set of experimental data ) , ( iii ) we analyze simultaneously all available data in the nucleus in question , ( iv ) by applying the particle - number - projected pairing approach we are able to show that the systematic discrepancies can not be attributed to the pairing correlations , and consequently ( v ) we arrive at a suggestion that a modification of the underlying interactions will be needed in order to improve the agreement with data .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in the @xmath0 tb nucleus eight sd bands have been observed .",
    "in addition to the two sd bands discovered relatively early@xcite , six new sd bands have been found and assigned to this nucleus recently@xcite using the eurogam spectrometer .",
    "those recent data were obtained from experiments at the nuclear structure facility , daresbury laboratory , using the @xmath8te(@xmath9al,6n)@xmath0 tb reaction at a bombarding energy of 154mev .",
    "the details of the experimental procedure can be found in@xcite ; here we only recall that the @xmath10-rays were detected by the eurogam spectrometer@xcite which consisted , for this experiment , of 42 operational ge detectors .",
    "the data rates in the individual ge detectors were 7 - 9 khz .",
    "the trigger condition used to select unsuppressed events was that at least 7 ge detectors were involved in a coincidence . after the suppression requirement was included",
    ", the average number of coincident detectors dropped to @xmath73.9 .",
    "a total data set of 5.5@xmath11 suppressed events with ge fold @xmath12 3 was recorded and after unpacking the high - fold - multiplicity events led to 3.1 @xmath13 @xmath14 coincidences .",
    "the final spectra were obtained by summing combinations of 3-dimensional gates set on the sd transitions in a 4-dimensional analysis@xcite .",
    "the assignment of the new 6 excited sd bands to @xmath0 tb was based on an unambiguous evidence of known @xmath10-ray transitions of the normal deformed nucleus following the de - excitation from the sd band members .",
    "the sd bands have been labeled 1,2,3,@xmath15,8 .",
    "the previously reported sd bands have been labeled 1 ( called the yrast band , although its position in energy with respect to other bands is not experimentally established ) and 2 ( the band which shows a remarkable similarity in terms of the @xmath16-ray energies with the sd band 1 of @xmath2dy ) .",
    "the other excited sd bands have been arbitrarily attributed labels ranging from 3 to 8 .    employing the same reaction",
    ", the @xmath0 tb nucleus has been recently reinvestigated using the eurogam ii array installed at the vivitron accelerator of the _ centre de recherches nuclaires _ in strasbourg .",
    "this array consisted of 54 high - efficiency ge detectors ( 30 tapered coaxial detectors and 24 clover detectors ) providing a photopeak efficiency of 7.4% at 1.33mev . with the large statistics and high peak - to - background ratio , it has been possible to obtain a higher precision of the sd @xmath10-ray transition energies which in the present study are used to extract accurate values of the corresponding dynamic moments .",
    "the experimental results for bands 1 and 2 are presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the intensities ( with uncertainties ) of the different bands relative to the yrast band are : 50(5)% ( band 2 ) , 35(5)% ( band 3 ) , 6(2)% ( band 4 ) , 10(2)% ( band 5 ) , 9(2)% ( band 6 ) , 11(2)% ( band 7 ) , 7(3)% ( band 8) .",
    "let us also mention that in the determination of the experimental frequencies and dynamic moments we use the expressions    [ eq300]@xmath17    where @xmath18=@xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 .",
    "in this section we summarize the main points of the calculations based on the average nuclear field with the deformed ws potential . the following three subsections",
    "present : ( i ) the structure of the hamiltonian used , sec.[sec3a ] , ( ii ) some remarks related to the self - consistency in the case of _ a priori _ non - self - consistent formalism with the ws potential , sec.[sec3b ] , and ( iii ) a short description of the actual variant of the strutinsky method applied , sec.[sec3c ] .",
    "the details can be found in the literature cited below and will not be repeated here . even though most of the mathematical expressions are available in the literature",
    ", there exist differences in notation between various authors , and we found important to recall the definitions of some basic quantities .",
    "the single - nucleonic energies and wave functions for nucleons moving in the deformed potential of the ws type , @xmath22 }           { \\{1+\\exp [ \\mbox{dist}_{\\sigma_{0 } } ( \\bbox{r};r_{0 } ) /a]\\ } } , \\ ] ] are found by solving the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "the spin - orbit term is included in the usual deformation - dependent form : @xmath23 }   { \\{1+\\exp [ \\mbox{dist}_{\\sigma_{\\text{so } } } ( \\bbox{r};r_{\\text{so } } ) /a_{\\text{so}}]\\ } }   \\right]\\times{\\bbox{p}}\\right\\}\\cdot{\\bbox{s } } ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the coulomb potential is added for protons . in the above relations the `` + '' sign applies for protons and the `` @xmath20 '' sign for neutrons , while @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the linear momentum and the spin operators , respectively . for reasons of compatibility with previous studies",
    ", we keep the factor @xmath26}^{2}$ ] in the definition of the spin - orbit potential ( @xmath27 is the nucleonic mass ) .",
    "then the spin - orbit strength parameter , @xmath28 , is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "we use @xmath29 for neutrons and @xmath30 for protons .",
    "the nuclear surfaces @xmath31 and @xmath32 , defining the central and spin - orbit fields , respectively , are expressed in terms of the spherical harmonics as @xmath33.\\ ] ] in the above relation , @xmath34 is a function of all the deformation parameters that guarantees the constant volume for any deformation , and with the central - potential radius parameter @xmath35fm for neutrons and @xmath36fm for protons ; similarly @xmath37fm for neutrons and @xmath38fm for protons .",
    "the central - potential depth - parameters are : @xmath39mev and @xmath40 while the diffuseness parameters are @xmath41fm for the central part and @xmath42fm for the spin - obit part of the potential , independently of the isospin ( for details see refs.@xcite and@xcite ) .",
    "finally , the geometrical distance of a point @xmath43 from the auxiliary surfaces @xmath44 defined above is denoted by @xmath45 ; the latter quantity is negative for @xmath43 in the nuclear interior and positive otherwise .    in our calculations",
    "we allow for the total routhian ( for definition of the routhians see the following sections ) minimization with the deformation - mesh defined by @xmath46 and @xmath47 with @xmath48 corresponding to 5 `` planes '' for fixed @xmath10 deformations [ @xmath49 = @xmath50@xmath51(@xmath10 ) and @xmath48 = @xmath52 @xmath50 @xmath53(@xmath10 ) ] as follows @xmath54 we solve the cranking equations of the standard form @xmath55 for @xmath56 with @xmath57 where the ws potential @xmath58 and the related spin - orbit term @xmath59 are defined in eqs.([eq31 ] ) and ( [ eq32 ] ) while the coulomb potential @xmath60 is that of the classical uniform sharp - edge charge distribution corresponding to the actual nuclear shape .    as always in numerical calculations of the matrix elements used for constructing the hamiltonian matrix , both the number of basis states and the number of points in the gauss - hermite integration formulae",
    "have been selected in such a way that the final results do not depend in any significant way of that choice ( for more details see ref.@xcite ) . in our case",
    "the number of the deformed harmonic - oscillator states used in each of the two parities was about 300 .      in the following ,",
    "the results of the cranking calculations performed within the hf approach will be compared with those obtained for the deformed ws potential .",
    "although it is not possible to formulate the self - consistency concept in the two approaches in the same way , and the ws calculations are _ a priori _ considered non - self - consistent , it will be of some importance to recall that our way of defining the deformed ws potential imposes a correlation between the equipotential surfaces @xmath61 and the surfaces of the constant density defined by @xmath62 as discussed in detail in@xcite .",
    "the second - order thomas - fermi expression@xcite for the density functional reads @xmath63}^{3/2 }                                  \\\\ & \\times &     \\left\\{1-\\frac{1}{8}\\frac{{\\hbar}^{2}}{2 m }         \\left[\\frac{\\bbox{\\nabla } v(\\bbox{r } ) \\cdot         \\bbox{\\nabla } v(\\bbox{r } ) }         { 4{[\\lambda - v(\\bbox{r})]}^{3}}\\right ]         + \\frac{\\delta v(\\bbox{r } ) }         { { [ \\lambda - v(\\bbox{r})]}^{2 } } \\right\\ } , \\nonumber     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the terms of the order @xmath64 have been neglected . requiring that the potential is equal to a constant , cf .",
    "eq.([eq39 ] ) , implies by virtue of eq.([eq31 ] ) that @xmath65 using the fact that @xmath66 and that @xmath67 for @xmath43 belonging to the equipotential surface , one obtains after elementary transformations , cf .",
    "ref.@xcite , that also @xmath68 as a result , at least within the accuracy of @xmath64 in the thomas - fermi approximation , condition ( [ eq39 ] ) implies condition ( [ eq39a ] ) . such a correlation between the geometry of the potential and that of the density is not valid generally",
    "neither the nilsson model nor a deformed ws potential with another type of argument in the exponent of eq.([eq31 ] ) , as used sometimes by other authors , gives such a correlation .",
    "obviously , the spin - orbit term may modify the above result ( cf .",
    "e.g.  ref.@xcite ) , but since this term has , on the average , matrix elements which are nearly an order of magnitude weaker as compared to those of the central part , its effect in the discussed context is also expected to be relatively weak .    anticipating some of our results presented below , and in particular surprising similarities between the high - spin behavior properties obtained by using the self - consistent hf method and a non - self - consistent approach with the deformed ws hamiltonian , one should bear in mind the particular property of definition ( [ eq31 ] ) used in this study .",
    "there are numerous presentations of the strutinsky method , as given for example in the original articles@xcite , and then applied to finite potentials ( as e.g.  in ref.@xcite ) . here",
    "we closely follow the presentation given in ref.@xcite , and we only briefly discuss the total - routhian - surface calculations , for which several authors use prescriptions slightly differing in details .",
    "our calculations of the total nuclear routhians are based on the expression @xmath69 where the summation extends over all the occupied nucleonic states ( i.e. , in particular takes into account the particle - hole excitations with respect to the reference configuration introduced in sec.[sec5 ] ) .",
    "the microscopic ( or shell ) energy is defined as usual by @xmath70 where the summation over @xmath71 extends now over all the single - nucleonic states of the reference configuration .",
    "the last term denotes the results of the strutinsky averaging procedure .",
    "this averaging depends on two standard parameters : the smoothing - polynomial order @xmath72 and the averaging width @xmath73 . in our applications we have @xmath74 and @xmath75 with @xmath76mev .",
    "arguments related to the stability of the final result with respect to ( small ) uncertainties in these parameters can be found in several publications , see e.g.  ref.@xcite and references therein .",
    "in the following sections , some details of a particular realization of the hf approach in our study will be described ; most of the formal development can be found in the literature and are also summarized in ref.@xcite .",
    "section [ sec4a ] presents some technical aspects related to the harmonic oscillator basis employed , the numerical calculations of the @xmath1-moments are discussed in sec.[sec4b ] , and the use of the quadrupole constraint to stabilize the iteration process is briefly commented in sec.[sec4c ] .      in the present study we have performed the hf calculations of sd rotational bands using the skyrme effective interaction . for this purpose",
    "a new numerical code hfodd has been constructed@xcite which uses the three - dimensional cartesian deformed harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis .",
    "the ho basis has up to now been used in solving the hf equations with the gogny interaction@xcite . on the other hand , for the skyrme interaction",
    "this method has been used at early stages of investigations@xcite and then abandoned in favor of the calculations in spatial coordinates@xcite .",
    "the main advantage of using the spatial coordinates consists in the fact that one may use the same spatial grid of points to treat nuclei of different deformations , while in the former method the basis parameters may need to be adjusted with varying deformation .",
    "( the sensitivity of the results with respect to this kind of a dependence decreases with an increasing harmonic - oscillator basis cut - off ; in principle the problem disappears in the limit of an infinite basis ) .",
    "however , the sd states have very similar deformations in many neighboring nuclei , and in such a case this particular deficiency disappears .",
    "we may then profit from the fact that the calculations which use the ho basis are in general much more stable , have better convergence properties , and hence require less computational effort .",
    "the details concerning the hfodd code will be presented elsewhere@xcite ; here we only give a few of its basic characteristics pertaining to the present application .",
    "the calculations have been performed using a fixed basis given by the ho frequencies @xmath77=11.200mev and @xmath78=6.246mev in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the harmonic - oscillator symmetry - axis , respectively .",
    "these values have been obtained by standard prescriptions developed for diagonalizing the deformed ws hamiltonian@xcite in the ho basis , and correspond to the ws potential with the deformations @xmath79=0.61 and @xmath80=0.10 .",
    "the basis has been restricted to the fixed number @xmath81 of ho states , i.e. , keeping the lowest @xmath81 single - particle energies @xmath82=@xmath83+@xmath84+@xmath85+@xmath86)@xmath78 .",
    "the actual calculations have been performed with @xmath81=306 .",
    "this corresponds to the maximal numbers of oscillator quanta equal to 8 and 15 in the perpendicular and parallel directions , respectively .",
    "the stability of results with respect to increasing the size of the ho basis is the main concern in all analyses using this technique , and have been studied in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact it is well known that the total energies are very slowly convergent as functions of the basis size .",
    "indeed , in the present calculations a similar effect is seen when we increase the basis from @xmath81=306 to @xmath81=604 , which corresponds to reaching the maximal numbers of 11 and 20 ho quanta in the two main directions .",
    "then the total energy of the yrast configuration of @xmath0 tb at the rotational frequency of @xmath87=0.6mev decreases from @xmath201199.322 to @xmath201201.889mev . a similar mechanism is well known also from other type of studies , with the schrdinger equation diagonalized in a given basis ( as for instance with the ws or the folded yukawa - type potentials ) .",
    "fortunately the relative ( excitation ) energies become stable for smaller bases than the absolute values@xcite .",
    "none of the interesting rotational properties depends in a significant way on an increase of the basis from @xmath81=306 to @xmath81=604 .",
    "for example , we obtain the changes of the average angular momentum from 59.95 to 59.99@xmath88 , of the mass quadrupole moment from 39.82 to 39.90b , and of the mass hexadecapole moment@xcite from 4.21 to 4.24b@xmath89 .",
    "the relative changes as function of @xmath87 are even smaller .",
    "most interestingly , the @xmath1-moment changes at the same time only from 84.71 to 84.84@xmath90mev@xmath91 . in view of the fact that the calculations for @xmath81=604 are a factor of five slower than those for @xmath81=306 , we consider it reasonable to keep the latter size of the basis in all calculations presented .",
    "an important advantage of using the ho basis consists in the fact that a rather small number of iterations is sufficient to obtain a high level of convergence .",
    "for example , in the case of the yrast configuration in @xmath0 tb at @xmath87=0.6mev , starting from the rotating ws state and performing 50 iterations is enough to obtain the total energy accurate up to 0.5kev .",
    "for all values of rotational frequency and with the same number of iterations performed , the relative precision remains comparable to the one cited above .",
    "this is very important for the calculation of the second moment of inertia @xmath1 .",
    "this quantity has to be calculated by a numerical differentiation , either of the average angular momentum @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath92 with respect to the rotational frequency @xmath5 , eq.([eq11 ] ) , or of the total energy @xmath93 , @xmath94 with respect to @xmath5 : @xmath95 where the cranking wave functions @xmath96 are obtained from the hf variational equation @xmath97 in order to obtain accurate values for @xmath1 , the relative errors of @xmath3 and @xmath93 as functions of @xmath5 should be kept as small as possible .",
    "the difference of values of @xmath1 calculated from eqs.([eq11 ] ) and ( [ req12 ] ) is a measure of self - consistency of solutions . in our example",
    ", the previously quoted value of @xmath98=84.71@xmath90mev@xmath91 has been obtained from eq.([eq11 ] ) , while at the same time eq.([req12 ] ) gives @xmath1=84.66@xmath90mev@xmath91 .",
    "these results have been obtained from the first - order finite - difference approximation of derivatives between @xmath87=0.60 and 0.61mev .",
    "together with the discussed uncertainties related to the restricted size of the basis , these values indicate that our calculated dynamical moments are accurate to about 0.1@xmath90mev@xmath91 , which is generally a higher precision than that presently available for the experimental values of @xmath1 .",
    "the sd states are localized in the pocket of the potential energy surface which is several mev above the main minimum .",
    "when the hf equations are solved by the standard iteration procedure@xcite , which we also use in our calculations , the wave functions may become gradually polluted by components of the solutions residing principally in the main well , and this may slow - down or even preclude any convergence to the secondary minimum . in order to prevent this kind of effects we have included in the minimized functional a quadratic constraint on the quadrupole moment@xcite , i.e. , we minimize @xmath99 with a small stiffness parameter @xmath100=0.01mev / b@xmath89 and the constraint value of @xmath101=42b .",
    "this is a very weak constraint which has no visible effect on the self - consistent values of the quadrupole moment .",
    "it shifts , however , the normal - deformed - minimum energy sufficiently high , so that it does not present any undesired competition with the sd one .",
    "the quadrupole constraint is at the origin of the second term in eq.([req12 ] ) , which compensates for the fact that the quadratic constraint adds to the functional a term which depends on the rotational frequency .",
    "the magnitude of this second term depends on the variations of the average quadrupole moment @xmath102 along the rotational band ( see sec.[sec5 ] ) and on the difference between @xmath103 and the target value @xmath101 . in the present calculations this term can be for some bands as large as 0.5@xmath90mev@xmath91 , and , therefore ,",
    "can not be neglected when comparing the values of @xmath1 calculated from eqs.([eq11 ] ) and ( [ req12 ] ) .",
    "in this section we present the results of the hf calculations of the multi - band excitation structure of the @xmath0 tb nucleus .",
    "in several cases the cross - check results based on the deformed potential of the ws form will also be presented .",
    "we divide this discussion into several steps : secs.[sec5a ] and [ sec5c ] are devoted to the analysis of the rotational bands in terms of the single - particle routhians , total energies , and dynamical moments @xmath1 , while the next ones present problems related to exit spins , shape changes along the rotational bands , and pairing .      most probably , only the lowest energy sd bands are populated in the present - day experiments on the sd nuclei .",
    "more precisely , the bands lying not too high in the energy scale , at spins between , roughly , 60@xmath88 and 80@xmath88 , can actually be detected .",
    "unfortunately not much more can be said about the population selectivity and no rules for , for instance , the population probability as a function of the actual configuration have been established . under these circumstances",
    "the only way of performing a systematic theoretical analysis consists in calculating numerous bands in excess of the number of those actually measured and in proceeding with a more detailed and critical selection analysis next .      as the first step the single - particle spectra of the deformed ws cranking hamiltonian , cf .",
    "sec.[sec3 ] , have been calculated as functions of the cranking frequency for @xmath87 ranging from 0 to 1mev for a few points corresponding to the typical quadrupole @xmath49 @xmath70.58 and the hexadecapole @xmath105 @xmath70.10 deformations known to represent well , on the average , the sd nuclei in the @xmath106@xmath7150 mass range .",
    "knowing those levels , we define the reference configuration that corresponds to the lowest - level occupation scheme for possibly largest @xmath87 range .",
    "the symbols of the particle - hole configurations used below refer to such a specific reference configuration as the underlying structure .",
    "it is worth mentioning that often more than one configuration could quite well serve as the reference and that the actual choice of such a configuration is a matter of commodity .",
    "in fact , an inconvenient choice of the reference would merely result in a more complicated labeling of the excited bands : a 1-particle 1-hole excitation with respect to a given reference configuration may become 2-particles 2-holes , 3-particles 3-holes etc .",
    "excitation with respect to the inconveniently chosen reference .    in the present analysis",

    "the reference of our choice is defined in terms of four types of the occupation numbers : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 referring to positive - parity and signature @xmath111=@xmath112 , positive - parity and signature @xmath111=@xmath113 , etc .",

    "are presented in fig.[fig5.3 ] .",
    "let us observe by comparing figs.[fig5.1 ] , [ fig5.2 ] , and [ fig5.3 ] , that the global features of the single - nucleon spectra obtained by making use of the deformed average field model with the ws hamiltonian and those of the hf with the skm * and siii interactions are quite similar .",
    "what is perhaps most striking is the fact that the ws hamiltonian and the hf method with the siii parametrization give very similar single - nucleonic levels indeed .",
    "the similarities are particularly well visible in the neutron spectra in figs.[fig5.1 ] and [ fig5.3 ] , and only to a slightly lesser extent in the proton spectra displayed in the figures .",
    "this observation can be interpreted in favor of both techniques that employ the two different average fields thus increasing our confidence in the implied results of the microscopic calculations .",
    "since the exit spins of most sd bands are not known , at present the only possible way of testing the calculated @xmath93 versus @xmath3 relation by experiment consists in comparing the resulting @xmath1-moments . before proceeding systematically with such comparisons",
    "some additional comments will be useful .",
    "we begin by discussing the ws calculations which have been performed here using the so - called `` universal '' parameters .",
    "the corresponding parameter set has been introduced in ref.@xcite , and later tested in many detailed calculations of the high - spin properties in nuclei .",
    "the corresponding parametrization of the central part of the ws potential employs the radius - parameter values of @xmath129(@xmath71 ) = @xmath130fm and @xmath129(@xmath119 ) = @xmath131fm for the neutrons and protons , respectively .",
    "historically , these parameter values have been fitted to improve the quality of the single - particle level spectra rather than to reproduce well the geometrical properties of nuclei , and it happens that they exceed considerably the more commonly accepted `` geometrical '' value of @xmath129@xmath132@xmath133fm .",
    "one of the direct implications of the above difference is that the kinematical moments of inertia @xmath134 , @xmath135 calculated from , e.g. , the fermi - gas model with the geometry defined by using the above radius - parameter values systematically exceed the rigid - body moments of inertia calculated from the classical formula with the standard nuclear matter density . within a classical but also within a semiclassical model , the moments of inertia simply scale with the square of the radius parameter , @xmath136 . as a result one should expect that the moments of inertia in various bands , calculated by using the `` universal '' parametrization of the ws hamiltonian will be , on the average , too large .",
    "we can see that such an expectation , valid for the kinematical moments will apply directly to the dynamical moments ( [ eq11 ] ) , @xmath137 and a scaling of the @xmath134-moments implies a similar scaling of the @xmath1 ones .    by scaling the calculated @xmath134 and @xmath98-moments we should , as a consequence , also scale the related physical quantities : rotational frequency , energies and routhians .",
    "one can see this after noticing that the scaling of the @xmath134 moment with a factor @xmath138 , that satisfies relation ( [ eq42 ] ) , for the quantized angular momenta @xmath139 ( which remain independent of any scaling ) , implies the necessity of scaling the rotational ( cranking ) frequency by a factor of @xmath140 .",
    "it then follows that the energies and routhians also scale as @xmath140 , so as to consistently satisfy the canonical relation @xmath141 .",
    "the results of the calculations of the @xmath1 moment for the reference ( in this case coinciding with the yrast ) configuration of @xmath0 tb are given in fig.[fig5.4 ] , where the ws and hf curves are compared with experimental data .",
    "top part of the figure gives results with no scaling applied .",
    "one can see , that the calculated values systematically exceed the experimental ones .",
    "in the ws case we know that , as mentioned above , the numerical values of the radius - parameters are too large and we can clearly consider at least a part of the discrepancy as related to `` too large a volume of the nucleus '' .",
    "therefore , in the bottom part of fig.[fig5.4 ] we show the same @xmath1-moments scaled by the factor @xmath138=0.9 .    in the hf case",
    "there is no obvious discrepancy between the calculated and experimental nuclear radii .",
    "nevertheless , the calculated @xmath1-moments as well as quadrupole moments are systematically slightly too large ( see refs.@xcite for recent measurements of the quadrupole moments and ref.@xcite for the results of systematic hf calculations of the quadrupole moments and comparison with experiment ) .",
    "such an overestimation is consistently obtained for many different skyrme force parameters@xcite . at present",
    ", no explanation of this systematic effect can be found . for the sake of the presentation we have therefore decided to use the same phenomenological scaling factor @xmath138=0.9 to present the results of hf calculations .",
    "this scaling procedure , as we have checked by an explicit comparison with the experimental results , works well for all the bands in the @xmath0 tb nucleus simultaneously .",
    "moreover , we have checked that by using the same scaling factor @xmath138=0.9 for many bands and for several nuclei simultaneously one reproduces well the experimental @xmath1 moments which otherwise remain too large .",
    "this conclusion is based on comparisons for the yrast bands in @xmath0dy , @xmath2dy , @xmath142dy , @xmath143 tb , and @xmath120 tb , and also for a few dozens of excited sd bands in the mass @xmath106@xmath7150 region .",
    "light gadolinum nuclei ( @xmath144gd and @xmath145gd ) have strong alignment effects in their yrast sd bands and are not well suited for the tests discussed here .",
    "slopes of the @xmath1 moments in @xmath146gd , @xmath143gd , and @xmath120gd are overestimated in the calculations ; for the discussion of the latter nucleus see sec[sec5b ] .",
    "conversely , not introducing the aforementioned scaling we find the calculated values systematically too high , by 8 to 10% .",
    "after applying the scaling procedure according to the discussion above , ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig5.4 ] for illustration ) , the @xmath98-moments are multiplied by the factor of @xmath138 and the angular frequencies by a factor of @xmath147 . then , a very good correspondence with the @xmath5 dependence of the experimental data is worth noticing .",
    "below we present all results scaled according to the prescription and parameters defined above .",
    "let us mention that no physical conclusion of this paper depends on using or not using the scaling procedure described above ; the scaling can be viewed as merely a `` graphical '' trick to facilitate a comparison with the experimental data .",
    "moreover , we have not attempted any detailed fit of the scaling factor @xmath138=0.9 which can still be varied within about @xmath148 without any obvious general deterioration of the agreement with data .",
    "the problem of the definition of the yrast configuration discussed in sec.[sec5a1 ] did not pose any serious difficulty .",
    "firstly , in nuclei with the nucleon numbers in the vicinity of large sd gaps ( as e.g.  @xmath149=@xmath150 and @xmath151=@xmath152 ) the yrast configurations corresponding to the occupation of the lowest - lying levels are relatively easily and unambiguously determined over a relatively long @xmath5-range since no , or very few level crossings occur at the fermi level ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig5.1 ] ) .",
    "secondly , the experimentally dominating sd band ( i.e. , the one with the highest population intensity ) is also easily distinguished . in the case of the other sd bands neither of the observations applies . in experiment",
    "several bands are populated with comparable ( usually weak ) intensities and their relative excitation energies are totally unknown . in theory ,",
    "numerous close lying bands remain _ a priori _ the candidates for a much smaller number of the experimental bands to be associated with .",
    "moreover , the uncertainties in the relative positions of the theoretically calculated levels which sometimes influence the level ordering may reach 500kev or more .",
    "this estimate corresponds to a typical discrepancy between the results obtained within commonly used average field models ( like ws potential or skyrme interaction parametrizations , skm * and siii as discussed above and illustrated in figs.[fig5.1 ] , [ fig5.2 ] and [ fig5.3 ] ) and may , occasionally , become markedly larger . consequently , in analyzing the structure of the nucleus in question we have applied the following approach :    \\(i ) our primary goal in this section is to recognize within the applied formalism the most probable single - nucleonic ( particle - hole ) structure that underlies the behavior of the experimentally found bands .",
    "\\(ii ) we are using , for the sake of _ qualitative _ argumentation , the calculated ordering of various sd bands : the lower the band energy at the _ high - spin limit _ , the higher the chance to find such a band among those populated in experiment .",
    "\\(iii ) we use the experimental @xmath1-moments and verify the possible single - nucleonic configurations by directly comparing @xmath1(@xmath5 ) with experiment .    another important piece of information suitable for identifying single - particle configurations is the sameness of bands in different nuclei , i.e. , the equality of the corresponding dynamical moments and specific relations which occur for the relative alignments , see the review in ref.@xcite . in the present work we mainly use and analyze the properties of the dynamical moments , because those of the relative alignments are very sensitive to the details of the effective interactions@xcite . a readjustment of the interaction parameters , especially those related to time - odd components of the mean field , seems to be necessary for a precise theoretical determination of the relative alignments .    in order to apply the guidelines ( ii ) and ( iii ) above",
    ", we first present the results for the lowest - lying one - particle one - hole excited bands . in figs.[fig5.5 ] and",
    "[ fig5.6 ] we show the total energies for the proton and neutron excitations , respectively . here and in the following we label the configurations by the corresponding nilsson labels of hole and particle states , as well as by the total parity and signature quantum numbers supplemented by ( arbitrary ) consecutive number attached to each configuration .",
    "since in @xmath0 tb the size of the proton shell gap is smaller than that for the neutrons , there are more low - lying proton than neutron excited bands .",
    "since we know that there exist uncertainties in the single - particle level positions that may influence the relative positions of some bands in a non - negligible manner , the results in figs.[fig5.5 ] and [ fig5.6 ] should be treated as a semi - quantitative guide .",
    "the figures show 10 proton particle - hole and 12 neutron particle - hole excited bands , respectively , that appear to be the lowest at @xmath153 , i.e. , in the spin range where the superdeformed bands are populated . we have placed some of the curves in the upper parts , and some others in the lower parts of the figures trying to illustrate an existence of `` families '' of bands , each family characterized by some specific features like slopes or band crossings . in the case of neutrons ,",
    "the separation into two families is particularly well visible .",
    "the differences in this case ( cf .  also figs .",
    "[ fig5.7 ] and [ fig5.8 ] ) correspond to the structure differences in the two characteristic hole - orbitals ( @xmath1543/2(r$]=@xmath155 or @xmath1543/2(r$]=@xmath156 , top parts , and @xmath1573/2(r$]=@xmath156 bottom parts ) .",
    "figures [ fig5.7 ] and [ fig5.8 ] present the theoretical predictions for the dynamical moments corresponding to the bands shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5.5 ] and [ fig5.6 ] , respectively .",
    "one can see that the theoretically calculated moments form `` families '' characterized by a similar behavior also in the proton case .",
    "in particular the bands built on the configurations of the type @xmath158(r$]=@xmath159 @xmath160 @xmath161(r$]=@xmath155 and @xmath1623/2(r$]=@xmath156 @xmath160 @xmath161(r$]=@xmath155 are characterized by similar slopes , in terms of the @xmath1 moments ; these slopes are different from that of the reference band . on the neutron side ,",
    "the similarities between the bands related to exciting the @xmath1573/2(r$]=@xmath156 orbital into the orbitals @xmath1639/2(r$]=@xmath159 , @xmath1643/2(r$]=@xmath159 , and @xmath1655/2(r$]=@xmath159 deserve noticing . distinguishing among these properties will be particularly useful when attributing the configurations to the experimental bands since , as mentioned before , several theoretical configurations provide similar @xmath1 moment dependence on the rotational frequency , while their energies are also quite close .",
    "we proceed with the interpretation of the experimental results for bands 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "although the most likely structures of these bands have already been discussed before in the literature@xcite , we found it instructive to illustrate the procedure of attributing the theoretical bands to the experimental ones , the procedure which will be of more importance for other bands for which an adequate interpretation remains less easy .    by eliminating the bands",
    "whose @xmath1-moments differ relatively strongly with respect to the experimental result for bands 2 - 4 , we arrive at a comparison presented in fig.[fig5.9 ] . here and in the following we denote the hf states by their dominant nilsson labels at _ high frequencies _ ,",
    "fig.[fig5.1 ] .",
    "for example , the above mentioned @xmath1611/2(r$]=@xmath155 routhian originates at low frequencies from the @xmath1623/2(r$]=@xmath155 state .",
    "experimental results for bands 2 and 4 agree rather well with calculations for configurations based on exciting either of the signature partners of the @xmath1581/2(r$]=@xmath159 orbitals into the @xmath1611/2(r$]=@xmath155 state . as seen in fig.[fig5.5 ]",
    ", the configuration based on the @xmath1581/2(r$]=@xmath112 ) routhian has the energy lower by about 1mev than that based on the corresponding signature partner , and therefore the former should be retained as the most likely interpretation of band 2 .",
    "similarly , the dynamical moment of the @xmath1623/2(r$]=@xmath156 @xmath160 @xmath1611/2(r$]=@xmath155 configuration , fig.[fig5.9 ] , middle part , reproduces very well the data for band 3 , and this supports the corresponding interpretation ( proposed also in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the suggestion of this configuration is based simultaneously on the fact that it corresponds to a low - energy excitation , as it is seen from fig.[fig5.5 ] , and that it provides a good agreement of the @xmath1 versus @xmath5 dependence with the experimental one .    on the other hand , as seen in figs.[fig5.1 ] , [ fig5.2 ] , and [ fig5.3 ] , all calculations give at high frequencies the low - lying routhian @xmath1691/2(r$]=@xmath155 that might produce configurations which are lower in energy , cf .",

    "the experimental results for bands @xmath0tb(5 ) and @xmath0tb(6 ) indicate a correlation with the yrast sequence of the isotope @xmath120tb@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the neutron routhian @xmath71[7,7,0]1/2(@xmath111=@xmath113 ) , cf .",

    "[ due to the level interactions at large @xmath5-values the label of this level changes into @xmath71[7,6,1]3/2(@xmath111=@xmath113 ) ] .",
    "indeed , calculations indicate that several neutron particle - hole excitations give the required dependence of @xmath1 versus @xmath5 , as seen in fig.[fig5.8 ] .",
    "these are excitations from the @xmath71[7,6,1]3/2(@xmath111=@xmath113 ) orbital to either of the @xmath71[4,0,2]5/2(@xmath111=@xmath172 ) , @xmath71[5,2,1]3/2(@xmath111=@xmath172 ) , or @xmath71[5,1,4]9/2(@xmath111=@xmath172 ) orbitals .",

    "one can see that the energies of the latter configurations are @xmath7(600 to 800 ) kev higher than those of the former ones , thus favoring the involvement of the neutron @xmath71[4,0,2]5/2 and @xmath71[5,2,1]3/2 orbitals as a more likely explanation .",
    "the experimental results for bands @xmath0tb(7 ) and @xmath0tb(8 ) indicate a correlation with the yrast band in the @xmath143gd nucleus@xcite .",
    "such a correlation suggests that the last proton intruder level , @xmath119[6,4,2]5/2(@xmath111=@xmath113 ) , remains unoccupied with the corresponding proton on a low lying orbital with a small @xmath1-contribution .",
    "in fact , the low - lying @xmath119[5,3,0]1/2(@xmath111=@xmath112 ) orbital visible , e.g. , in fig.[fig5.1 ] provides an excellent result , cf .",
    "fig.[fig5.11 ] .",
    "however , since a pair of degenerate bands is seen in the experiment , one should also consider some other possibilities .",
    "in fact , several neutron configurations mentioned in the preceding section remain equally good candidates , and in fig.[fig5.11 ] we also present a comparison with the experiment of the results obtained for the @xmath71[7,6,1]3/2(@xmath111=@xmath113 ) @xmath160 @xmath71[4,0,2]5/2(@xmath111=@xmath172 ) excitations .",
    "it is important to observe that the similarity between the @xmath98-moments in @xmath143gd(1 ) , and those in the @xmath0tb(7,8 ) bands is accompanied by noticeable differences in both the @xmath176 and @xmath177 moments calculated for the bands with the configurations mentioned .",
    "for instance the proton excited configuration carries about 0.5b more than the neutron one : @xmath178 $ ] @xmath179 @xmath180 $ ] , as it is seen in fig.[fig5.11 ] .    for the bands @xmath0tb(7 ) and @xmath0tb(8 ) we thus have three possible configurations which give almost indistinguishable dynamical moments .",
    "the importance of the above example lies in the fact that the configurations for rather different quadrupole moments and/or deformations may still lead to very similar dynamical moments .",
    "therefore , a direct association of `` identical '' quadrupole moments and `` identical '' dynamical moments is not supported by microscopic calculations . the bands having identical dynamical moments",
    "may still carry quite different deformations and/or quadrupole moments .",
    "the problem of the exit spins in sd bands is one of the most actual in the present - day studies of the nuclear superdeformation .",
    "many questions remain half - answered since the connections between the sd bands and the rest of the nuclear decay schemes are not known in the @xmath106@xmath7150 nuclei from the experimental point of view .",
    "this makes it impossible to measure , e.g. , the absolute alignments or @xmath134-moments , and to estimate the degree to which the rapid nuclear collective rotation resembles that of a rigid body .",
    "such questions are being posed also in relation to the pairing behavior at high spins and in many other contexts .",
    "our calculations allow , in principle , to predict the absolute ( and thus also the relative ) exit spins of the sd bands studied . in practice , however , there are some deficiencies of ( all ) the methods used which impose limitations on the predictive power related to these particular results of calculations .    first of all , in our hf calculations the pairing correlations have been neglected and the obtained results concerning the alignment effect may introduce at least small uncertainties . although it is often believed that the spins calculated at a given cranking frequency @xmath5 must be lower",
    "when the pairing correlations are included , the actual tendency will depend on the position of the fermi level relative to the occupation of the large-@xmath181 shells : the down - sloping ( beginning of the shell ) and the up - sloping ( upper part of the shell ) orbitals contribute to the total alignment in opposite ways .",
    "several aspects related to pairing will be presented in sec.[sec5b ] .",
    "we have analyzed the calculated spin versus frequency plots for all the bands studied in this article .",
    "the experimental spins of the last levels seen experimentally are not known .",
    "therefore , we can only compare the theoretical and experimental _ differences _ of spin along the calculated and observed bands .",
    "to this end , we define the theoretical difference of spin as @xmath182 where @xmath183 is calculated from the two lowest experimental transitions according to the standard expression ( [ eq300a ] ) .",
    "this theoretical difference can be compared to the experimental difference of spin @xmath184 ( as a function of @xmath5 ) relative to the ( unknown ) spin @xmath185 of the state fed by the lowest transition seen in experiment .",
    "this experimental difference of spin simply equals twice the number @xmath186 of the gamma transition counted from the bottom of the band .",
    "a shift of 2@xmath88 is added to both definitions ( [ eq402a ] ) and ( [ eq402b ] ) to account for the fact that the lowest experimental value of the frequency ( [ eq300a ] ) ( @xmath183 ) is known at @xmath185 + 2@xmath88 .",
    "for all the sd bands in @xmath0 tb , calculated within the hf method using the skm * force and with the scaling factor @xmath138=0.9 discussed in sec.[sec5a2 ] , the differences between @xmath187 and @xmath188 do not exceed @xmath189 , for all the frequencies studied , i.e. , from 0.3 to 0.9mev/@xmath88 .",
    "the same is also true ( up to 0.5@xmath88 ) for the yrast band in @xmath2dy . on the other hand ,",

    "the results for the @xmath190-values have been given in the table as differences with respect to the @xmath193=69/2@xmath88 value obtained for band 1 which is used as the reference .",
    "the representation in terms of differences is used to stress that the absolute value of @xmath193 may be considered less certain ( given the uncertainties of the scaling procedure , neglect of pairing , etc . ) as compared to relative alignments between different bands , which are expected to be much less model dependent .",
    "for example , the exit spin obtained in @xmath2dy(1 ) from the hf calculations without pairing is @xmath190=26@xmath88 ( for the state fed by the 602.4kev transition ) .",
    "this is fully compatible with the exit spin of 57/2@xmath88 obtained in band @xmath0tb(2 ) ( for the next transition of 646.5kev ) and giving the relative alignment of + 1/2@xmath88 , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effects of dynamical correlations caused by pairing on the alignment mechanism in sd bands of the neighboring nucleus @xmath2dy have been studied , e.g. , in ref.@xcite .",
    "these effects are expected to be small , of the order of a few @xmath88 at the most , and to be rather regular functions of the frequency .",
    "the corresponding alignment corrections were calculated to be negative for several bands in the @xmath106@xmath7150 nuclei .",
    "we have repeated the analysis of these correlations for the even - even neighbors of @xmath0 tb , i.e. , for @xmath2dy and @xmath120gd , for which the pairing effects are not influenced by the blocking mechanism , and are easier to extract in a relatively pure form ( cf .",

    "the shape evolution for various configurations studied in this article has been determined by calculating the expectation values of the quadrupole moments , @xmath176 and @xmath194 , and the hexadecapole moments @xmath177 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196@xcite . the calculated axial quadrupole and hexadecapole moments , @xmath176 and @xmath177 , decrease with increasing rotational frequency for all the bands studied . the corresponding results for the most important proton moments , i.e. , @xmath176 and @xmath177 are presented in fig.[fig5.12 ] . in fig.[fig5.13 ] we show for each band the proton quadrupole moments in function of the dynamical moments",
    ". one can see that these relations are nearly linear , which indicates that the changes in @xmath1 are correlated with changes of @xmath176 .",
    "one can interpret this characteristic result as a dynamical - moment evolution accompanying the nuclear - shape polarization due to the rotation .",
    "it is also worth observing that the proton excited configurations have noticeably higher quadrupole moments and that their slopes are slightly higher than those of the neutron excited bands .",
    "slight but systematic deviations from the axiality are predicted with increasing rotational frequency .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the deviations from axiality for the signature - partner configurations , @xmath119[3,0,1]1/2(@xmath111=@xmath112 ) @xmath160 @xmath119[6,6,0]1/2(@xmath111=@xmath112 ) and @xmath119[3,0,1]1/2(@xmath111=@xmath113 ) @xmath160 @xmath119[6,6,0]1/2(@xmath111=@xmath112 ) , attributed to bands 2 and 4 , respectively , have opposite signs , although they both remain small .",
    "the axial hexadecapole moments @xmath177 are relatively diversified in that their variations in function of the configuration and rotational frequency may reach as much as 25% .",
    "the more exotic hexadecapole moments with the non - zero @xmath197-components , i.e. , @xmath195 and @xmath196 , have also been calculated .",
    "the interest in those moments has grown recently in relation with the so - called @xmath198=2 staggering observed in transition energies of some rare - earth sd nuclei .",
    "the staggering could manifest a presence of those exotic multipoles in the nuclear shapes and in particular , the non - zero @xmath196-moments could manifest the nuclear @xmath199-symmetry , as suggested in ref.@xcite and discussed in@xcite . the effect in question may be very small , as shown by microscopic calculations@xcite . experimentally , the staggering phenomenon has not been reported to exist in @xmath0 tb nucleus .",
    "nevertheless , we found it of interest to estimate the order of magnitude of the relevant hexadecapole moments .",
    "the calculations indicate that the @xmath195-moments , although typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath177-moments , remain non - zero , while the @xmath196-moments are still at least by a factor of a few smaller .",
    "the main purpose of the scaling procedure introduced in sec.[sec5a2 ] was , on the one hand , to quantify the systematic deviations from the experiment of the obtained results for the @xmath1-moments .",
    "on the other hand this procedure proves indeed that the obtained discrepancies are systematic since the same scaling factor has been successfully used in various nuclei ( and for all the bands known in each of them ) .",
    "the comparisons were made for several dozens of bands ; presentation of these results was limited so far in this paper to 8 bands in @xmath0 tb only .",
    "discrepancies of similar order of magnitude were also present in calculations of other authors , but were not discussed in any major detail . only as a result of an extended comparison with the experimental data we were lead to a suggestion that the discrepancies are systematic and",
    "thus that the underlying theories ( or parametrizations of the forces ) might be , and most likely should be improved .",
    "as it is well known , the pairing correlations influence the moments of inertia in a rather characteristic manner .",
    "typically ( although not generally ) , the stronger the pairing correlations , the smaller the kinematical moments @xmath134 . the purpose of the present section is to estimate the effect of pairing on the discussed moments , thus putting more restriction on the uncertainties produced by the applied nuclear effective forces .",
    "a technique used here differs from those of refs.@xcite and@xcite in that we perform the particle number projection ( pnp ) of the rotating bcs type wave functions _ before _ variation ( in the former publication the rpa technique within the nilsson model has been used while in the latter , an approximate projection in terms of the lipkin - nogami method together with the hfb approximation ) . here",
    "we apply the pairing - self - consistent bogolyubov method and the pnp before variation , using the standard monopole pairing hamiltonian with the constant average matrix elements , different for the protons and the neutrons ( see below ) , and the ws cranking approach .",
    "calculations@xcite of the sd bands in @xmath106@xmath7150 nuclei have shown that the inclusion of pairing through the density - dependent zero - range interactions improves the agreement with data in @xmath120gd , but at the same time the agreement in @xmath2dy is destroyed .",
    "it seems therefore , that at present one needs some more effort , also in the case of the hf approach , to clarify the problem of the effective interactions used , and although here we will not be able to carry through such a complex project , we would nevertheless like to quantify the difficulty and prepare the starting point for a more advanced discussion .",
    "below we are going to concentrate on the two neighbor - isotones of the @xmath0tb@xmath200 nucleus , i.e. , @xmath120gd@xmath200 and @xmath2dy@xmath200 .",
    "we believe that studying the two even - even nuclei has , in the present context , some important advantages . as our calculations , as well as those of other authors indicate , in the isotones in question the main pairing contributions come from the @xmath151=86 neutron system .",
    "since the relative proton / neutron pairing strengths are uncertain , in studying the weak pairing limit , the two even - even nuclei mentioned offer less uncertainties as compared to odd-@xmath106 ones in which the blocking in the case of the odd proton may cause an additional difficulty . in other words : it is not known at present whether at the weak pairing limit that we are confronted with at high spins the usual blocking procedure is a sufficient an approximation .    in order to estimate the influence of the pairing on the alignment process",
    ", we have calculated the kinematical and dynamical moments in function of rotational frequency at fixed deformations representing the average equilibrium - deformation values for the two nuclei in question ( for details see captions to figs.[fig5.14 ] and [ fig5.15 ] ) .",
    "we have taken @xmath151 and @xmath149 single - particle states into account when constructing the bogolyubov transformation for neutrons and protons , respectively . when parametrizing the pairing constants ( average matrix elements ) we took as a starting point the pairing force strength parameters from ref.@xcite    @xmath201 , \\\\",
    "\\label{eq45 }     { g}_{p}&=&\\frac{1}{a}\\left[17.90 + 0.176(n - z)\\right ] ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where they have been adjusted to experimental data on normal nuclei by applying the pairing - self - consistent bogolyubov formalism without the pnp .",
    "when used within the particle projection formalism , these values have to be decreased , by about 15% ( several aspects related to the pnp technique can be found in ref.@xcite ( solvable model ) and , e.g. , in refs.@xcite ( cranking with the ws hamiltonian ) ) . in the present application we use the reduction factors of @xmath202 for both the neutrons and the protons , i.e. , we apply @xmath203 and @xmath204 in the monopole pairing hamiltonian . in this respect",
    "we in fact apply the parametrization studied earlier in the normal nuclei thus not introducing new parameters for those nuclei studied in this paper .",
    "the results corresponding to our pnp calculations are presented in figs.[fig5.14 ] and [ fig5.15 ] for the @xmath2dy and @xmath120gd nuclei , respectively .",
    "let us observe that the high spin results for the dynamical moments in @xmath120gd agree very well with experiment .",
    "note that the scaling factor used here , @xmath138=0.9 , is the same as that applied in the calculations without pairing presented previously . in other words , in this nucleus the calculations without pairing would not agree with the data .    altogether , similarly as in ref.@xcite the results with pairing correspond to an increase in @xmath1 moments as compared to those without pairing . at lower spins the crossing observed in the data through the rise in the @xmath1 moments appears at a similar frequency also in the calculations , although the theoretical crossing frequency is slightly too large . in any case",
    "such a crossing is to a far an extent a matter of individual level positions rather than the collective pairing phase , and as such is of less importance for the discussion in this section .    the results for the dynamical moments in @xmath2dy present similar defect at small frequency limit where the calculation provide a crossing - like structure at frequencies which are slightly too high .",
    "again , for most of the spin values , the dynamical moments obtained with pairing are larger than those without pairing .",
    "consequently , the pairing can not be a remedy for the too high moments as calculated ( without scaling ) both within the ws and hf methods .    concerning the high spin behavior of the dynamical moments ( slightly different slopes in theory as compared to the data )",
    ": we have checked that a shape evolution ( ignored in the calculations presented in figs.[fig5.14 ] and [ fig5.15 ] ) brings in the effects of broad proton crossings whose onsets are already visible in the routhians from fig.[fig5.3 ] .",
    "these effects are present in a form of a slight modification of the @xmath1 vs. @xmath5 dependence in the experimental frequency range at highest spins only when the proton pairing is taken into account .",
    "the aforementioned modification is sufficient to provide the correct asymptotic of the @xmath98 at high spins in @xmath2dy .",
    "having obtained an overall agreement with the data on the dynamical moments we have also compared the @xmath205-moments as well .",
    "the agreement of the kinematical moments can be considered very good for both nuclei when the experimental exit - spin values ( so far not measured ) are assumed to be equal to those calculated according to the method described in sec[sec5d ] , i.e. , @xmath190=24 and 32@xmath88 for @xmath2dy and @xmath120gd , respectively . incidentally , without pairing , the same method gives the value of @xmath190=38@xmath88 in @xmath120gd , and an incorrect behavior for the spin difference @xmath187 .",
    "let us note that by taking into account the pairing correlations a good description of the kinematical moments at the high - spin limit is obtained for the same values of the scaling factor and pairing constants common for both nuclei , although the effects of pairing , especially in the neutrons , are calculated to be markedly different in the two isotones discussed .",
    "in all compared situations a scaling factor was necessary in order to bring the too high no - pairing results on the @xmath134 and @xmath1-moments towards the experimental data simultaneously for both nuclei studied .",
    "for all the three nuclei , i.e. , @xmath120gd@xmath200 , @xmath0tb@xmath200 , and in @xmath2dy@xmath200 , the inertia contribution coming from the neutrons is expected to dominate that of the protons by about a factor of two ; also the pairing effects are calculated to have about a factor of two more effect in the neutron case .",
    "comparison of the results in the top and the bottom parts of figs.[fig5.13 ] and [ fig5.14 ] indicates that at the highest frequency range the differences between the proton contributions for the case with pairing as compared to the no - pairing case amount to not more than about 1@xmath90mev@xmath91 ( about 1% ) in @xmath2dy nucleus and about 0.5@xmath90mev@xmath91 ( about 0.5% ) in the @xmath120gd nucleus . in the case of the neutrons the corresponding differences are slightly larger but also very small and thus the pairing is calculated to influence the kinematical moments at the highest frequency limit by about @xmath206 .    at the low frequency range",
    "the pairing correlations are expected to be systematically more important .",
    "the effect of pairing at @xmath207 on the moment of inertia is about @xmath208 in @xmath2dy and about @xmath209 in @xmath120gd .",
    "the main difference between the calculations for @xmath2dy and @xmath120gd is the smaller deformation in the case of @xmath120gd ; the deformations for most of the bands in the @xmath0 tb nucleus are in between those for the discussed even - even isotones .",
    "consequently we should expect that at the low frequency range in the @xmath0 tb nucleus , the pairing correlations should still amount to @xmath210 on the average , those of the protons being negligible for two reasons : firstly they are very small in the two neighboring even - even nuclei and , secondly , the @xmath211 odd proton in the @xmath0 tb is expected to diminish the proton pairing effect even more due to the blocking arguments .",
    "this is also why the results for the terbium nucleus are expected to lie in between those for the neighboring even - even nuclei studied here .",
    "the detailed analysis of this nucleus calls first , however , for a microscopic justification of the scaling factor introduced in the present study , and for an improved treatment of pairing in an odd nucleus .    there exists of course an uncertainty margin in the above estimates .",
    "the dynamical moments are sensitive to the detailed variation of the single - nucleonic routhians with the rotational frequency and a slow alignment of one single orbital may modify the @xmath1 moment considerably thus increasing the risk of estimating the collective pairing effect from the influence of one level . secondly , it is impossible to experimentally separate the proton and neutron contributions and thus in the calculations one may obtain in principle similar results by increasing , e.g. , the proton pairing strength while decreasing that of the neutrons . fortunately ,",
    "in the two nuclei discussed the protons contribute significantly less to the total inertia as compared to the neutrons and , in addition , the neutron pairing effects at @xmath212 in the dy and gd isotones differ considerably .",
    "consequently the second uncertainty mentioned has a rather small influence on the final result .",
    "in this article the two most efficient microscopic approaches in the high - spin nuclear structure calculations , i.e. , those based on the average nuclear field parametrization in terms of the deformed ws potential and the self - consistent hf approach together with the cranking method have been applied .",
    "the results of the calculations employing these two different methods and also the results of the calculations with two different parametrizations of the skyrme interactions have been compared .    despite of the fact that the formalisms used differ strongly , the efforts put earlier ( by other authors ) in optimizing the parametrizations of the interactions seem to converge : the single - nucleon spectra generated by the hf and the ws hamiltonians are very similar .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that at least for the nucleus studied the self - consistent hf solutions and the ws - strutinsky energy minimized results lead to similar super - deformed shell closures . in protons",
    "there is a series of shell gaps corresponding to @xmath149=62 , 64 and 66 with a characteristic high level - density areas closing those gaps from below and from above .",
    "the @xmath119[3,0,1]1/2 orbital separates the former two gaps and the @xmath119[6,5,1]3/2 orbital the latter two gaps in both skm * and siii parametrizations of the skyrme interaction and in the ws case .",
    "of course in the high - level density areas the relative positions of the single - particle states differ slightly but practically all the same nilsson orbitals are represented there . in the neutron",
    "spectra the @xmath151=86 sd gap is cut into two ( @xmath151=86 and @xmath151=85 gaps ) by one of the signature partners of the @xmath71[7,7,0]1/2 orbital .",
    "the neutron spectra manifest two systematic differences ( when comparing hf and ws ) : ( i ) the signature splitting of the @xmath71[7,7,0]1/2 orbital is much stronger in the hf approach independently of the force , and ( ii ) below the big gaps we find , in the decreasing order , the @xmath71[6,4,2]5/2 , @xmath71[6,5,1]1/2 , and @xmath71[4,1,1]1/2 orbitals ; in the ws case these n=6 orbitals are inverted .",
    "the inversion , however , did not cause any significant problem in interpretations of the spectra in the @xmath0 tb nucleus .",
    "theoretical calculations of the dynamical moments indicate a fair or good agreement for eight bands known experimentally in @xmath0 tb .",
    "this is possible , however , only after a phenomenological scaling factor , common for all bands , is introduced .",
    "generally , for higher - lying sd bands a unique interpretation of the single - nucleonic structure in terms of the nilsson labels does not seem possible ( at least at present ) for several reasons .",
    "firstly , the single - nucleonic routhian spectra contain levels of different intrinsic characteristics which remain nearly degenerate over the long ranges of rotational frequency .",
    "they lead to numerous configurations with very similar alignment and dynamical - moment properties and of very close total energies .",
    "secondly , the band degeneracy ( twinned band effect ) does not provide major help in such cases since several among excited bands may produce nearly identical band spectra .",
    "the deformation changes in function of the band - configurations and rotational frequency are very characteristic : in all bands discussed not only the quadrupole ( @xmath176 ) and the hexadecapole ( @xmath177 ) moments decrease with increasing frequency , as observed also by other authors , but also their variation seems clearly correlated with that of the dynamical and kinematical moments . with progressing alignment small triaxialities ( equivalent to the @xmath10-deformations of the order of a few degrees ) develop as well .    the possibility of the existence of some special symmetries ( like , e.g. , an occurrence of the shapes with the @xmath199-symmetry ) has been studied .",
    "no indication for the @xmath196-moments has been found ( an upper limit is predicted at the level of at most 10@xmath213@xmath214@xmath177 ) .",
    "the calculations allow to predict the values of the exit spins , i.e. , the spins of the lowest observed sd transitions .",
    "these predictions are given by the values of spin calculated at the rotation frequency corresponding to the lowest observed transition , and rounded to the nearest half - integer value compatible with the total signature .",
    "the differences between the exit - spin values in different bands are expected to be more reliable than the corresponding absolute values .",
    "we found that the systematic discrepancies between the experimental and calculated results exist in both ws and hf approaches , even if the pairing correlations are taken into account .",
    "this suggests a need for more effort in determining the optimal parametrizations of the effective interactions used for a description of the high - spin properties of the strongly - deformed nuclei .",
