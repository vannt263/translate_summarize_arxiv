    "called dark energy , accounts for seventy percent of today s mass  energy budget and is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate .    despite of its major importance in explaining the astrophysical data , the nature of dark energy is one of the greatest mysteries of modern cosmology .",
    "the simplest candidates for this unknown entity include the cosmological constant ( see e.g. @xcite ) and a scalar field , commonly designated quintessence , which varies across space and changes with time ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "though the nature of dark energy is unknown , one can still try to infer its properties from its effects on cosmic structure formation .",
    "in fact , the behaviour of linear perturbations in a scalar field and its effect on large structure formation has been investigated by a number of authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the behaviour of quintessence during the non  linear gravitational collapse is not well understood and is currently under investigation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "usually , it is assumed that the quintessence field does not exhibit density fluctuations on cluster scales and below .",
    "the reason for this assumption is that , according to linear perturbation theory , the mass of the field is very small ( the associated wavelength of the particle is of the order of the hubble radius ) and , hence , it does not feel matter overdensities of the size of tenth of a mpc or smaller @xcite .",
    "the assumption of neglecting the effects of matter perturbations on the evolution of dark energy at small scales is indeed a good approximation when perturbations in the metric are very small .",
    "however , care must be taken when extrapolating the small  scale linear ",
    "regime results to the highly non  linear regime .",
    "then , locally the flat frw metric is no longer a good approximation to describe the geometry of overdense regions .",
    "highly non  linear matter perturbations could , in principle , modify the evolution of perturbations in dark energy considerably , and these could , in turn , back - react and affect the evolution of matter overdensities .",
    "moreover , it is natural to think that once a dark matter overdensity decouples from the background expansion and collapses , the field inside the cluster feels the gravitational potential inside the overdensity and its evolution will be different from the background evolution .",
    "this is indeed a general feature of not only cosmological scalar fields whose properties depend on the local density of the region they `` live in '' @xcite , but also of massless particles , such as , photons ( example of astrophysical effects are : lensing , riess - schiama effect , sachs - wolfe effect ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the quintessence field could have an important impact in the highly non  linear regime .",
    "@xcite noted that the quintessence field could indeed be important on galactic scales .",
    "it was put forward by @xcite that it could in fact be responsible for the observed flat rotation curves in galaxies .",
    "other authors @xcite discussed more exotic models , based on tachyon fields , and argued that the equation of state is scale  dependent .    if it turns out that the effects of dark matter density perturbations and metric influence perturbations of quintessence on small scales , this could significantly change our understanding of structure formation on galactic and cluster scales .",
    "@xcite have shown that properties of halos , such as the density contrast and the virial radius , depend critically on the form of the potential , the initial conditions of the field , the time evolution of its equation of state and on the behaviour of quintessence in highly non  linear regions . in reality , the dependence on the inhomogeneity of dark energy is only important for some dark energy candidates",
    ". if the dark energy equation of state @xmath0 is constant , the differences between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases are small , as long as the equation of state does not differ largely from @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "if dark energy is indeed a non - negligible component inside matter overdensities , then the dynamics of structure formation may be strongly dependent on the nature of dark energy .",
    "different dark energy models will contribute in very particular ways to the gravitational potential of the overdensity via the poisson equation .",
    "this may result in specific signatures in the formation of large scale structures .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate how inhomogeneous quintessence models may have a specific signature even in the linear regime of large scale structure formation .",
    "in particular , we investigate how the time of collapse is affected by the inhomogeneity of dark energy and how this is reflected on the linearly extrapolated density threshold above which structures will end up collapsing , i.e. @xmath2 .",

    "the article is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we investigate minimally coupled dark energy models and describe briefly the spherical collapse model and its dependence on the homogeneity nature of dark energy . in section 3 we generalise our analysis to the case of coupled quintessence models .",
    "a summary of our principal results is given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "firstly , the system takes a finite amount of time before reaching the attractor solution .",
    "secondly , the equation of state evolves inside the collapsing region from @xmath90 at high redshifts to @xmath91 at the time of collapse ( see fig .",

    "indeed , after the turn around @xmath42 becomes negative switching the frictional into an anti - frictional term in the equation of motion of the scalar field . as the scalar potential becomes less and less important the kinetic energy of the field approaches the asymptotic evolution @xmath94 ( therefore an effective @xmath95 ) which would in principle overtake the energy density of pressureless matter as @xmath96 . in reality",
    ", this will never happen , since the singularity in the collapse will not be reached .",
    "the dark matter halo will virialise much before and a dynamical equilibrium will be reached , where the halo has a constant radius ( the virial radius ) .    it is important to notice that though the equation of state for dark energy inside the overdensity can become positive , it is still negative in the cosmological background ( see figure [ wphi ] ) .",
    "hence , the universe s background expansion will not be affected by the local behaviour of the dark energy inside clusters .",
    "the usual late time accelerated expansion still occurs as normally measured by snia .",
    "the only effects due to the positivity of the dark energy equation of state occur only inside the overdensities @xcite . moreover , within the models investigated , the dark energy contribution inside the cluster is always subdominant when compared to the one of dark matter and it only becomes dominant very near the collapse .",
    "we should not expect , therefore , any unusual effects on the virialisation process resulting from the positivity of the equation of state inside the cluster , at least for those models with negligible background dark energy contribution at high redshifts .",

    "note that for the cases of inhomogeneous scalar field dark energy , the value of @xmath28 at high redshifts is considerably lower than for @xmath100 cases .",
    "it is worth noting that for an inhomogeneous dark energy , the evolution of @xmath28 with redshift is significantly altered for the phantom energy , with @xmath28 decreasing from 1.753 to 1.686 for increasing redshift .",
    "these variations of the density threshold will obviously modify the predicted numbers of collapsed objects .",
    "the reason why one finds a difference in @xmath28 when comparing homogeneous and inhomogeneous dark energy models , becomes clear when one analyses the poisson equation for the gravitational potential , @xmath101 , inside the overdensity , @xmath102 in the case of homogeneous models @xmath103 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\kappa^2}{2 } \\left[(1+\\delta)\\rho_{{\\rm m } } +    ( 1 + 3w_{\\phi})\\rho_{\\phi } \\right ] \\ , , \\label{poisson1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath104 .",

    "since @xmath106 is generally negative , the source term in equation ( [ poisson ] ) is smaller than in the homogeneous case .",
    "conversely , if @xmath106 is more negative than @xmath107 the contribution of the scalar field is less and less important and the source term is larger than in the homogeneous case . in conclusion , inhomogeneous dark energy models will contribute to the gravitational potential inside the overdensities in a different way to homogeneous ones .",
    "these will clearly affect the whole dynamics of the formation of structures .",
    "in particular the late stages of the non - linear collapse of overdensities , such as the time of collapse , virial radius and matter density contrast @xcite . in the case of dark energy candidates with a dynamical equation of state , such as scalar fields , the effects will be even more interesting . in these cases the source term in equation ( [ poisson ] ) will vary in time since @xmath99 will change during the formation of the collapsing overdensity , resulting in a more complex evolution for the gravitational potential .",
    "recall that @xmath99 may even become positive and approach @xmath95 during the late phase of collapse .",
    "hence the dark energy pressure in equation ( [ poisson ] ) will source the gravitational potential positively , in opposition to the usual homogeneous models where @xmath106 is always negative .",
    "the effects will be stronger at low redshifts when dark energy dominates the universe density in the background universe .",
    "for a constant equation of state @xmath0 the following expressions provide an accurate fit to the evolution of the density contrast as shown in fig .",

    "let us now look at the case when the scalar field has a coupling with all or part of the dark matter ( see for e.g. @xcite ) . in these models , inhomogeneities in the quintessence field may appear due to two main reasons : the first , which is the same as in minimally coupled models , is the change of the local geometry of the region where the overdensity `` lives in '' , which is just the general relativistic effect of the spacetime deformation .",
    "the second is the dragging of the scalar field by the dark matter particles caused by the coupling between them .",
    "this second effect is similar to the one which occurs in scalar - tensor theories and leads to inhomogeneities in the scalar field @xcite . due to these causes , it is then natural to expect stronger inhomogeneity effects in this kind of models than in the minimally coupled one",

    "these investigations are imperative for cosmological studies that rely on these ingredients to measure dark energy . examples of these studies , for the case of homogeneous dark energy models , include semi - analytical studies of strong lensing statistics @xcite and weak lensing number counts @xcite . and for inhomogeneous models",

    "many other astrophysical phenomena may reflect the inhomogeneities in dark energy fluid during the non - linear regime .",
    "for instance , the merger of dark matter halos depend on the gravitational potential between them",
    ". effects on the evolution and magnitude of the gravitational potential , may also affect peculiar velocities of galaxies inside clusters .",
    "one should also point out here , that in low - density regions of the universe , such as voids , inhomogeneous dark energy models , may play an important role as well . in those regions the local spacetime geometry may be different from the usual friedman - robertson - walker metric one usually assumes for the background universe .",
    "it is natural to think that dark energy inside voids may behave differently from its background behaviour .",
    "this may again affect the dynamics of formation of voids in the universe .",
    "all these effects could in principle be detected using galaxy redshift surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
