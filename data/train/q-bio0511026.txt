    "the use of space by animals is the result of a combination of internal factors , such as the physiology and morphology of the animal , and external factors such as the environment .",
    "it is well known that mammals , in order to conduct their daily activity , occupy only part of their available environment : the so - called home range  @xcite .",
    "a recent study on the scaling of home range size as function of animal body mass or metabolic rate  @xcite shows that the home range dimensions are a compromise between two ingredients : the necessity for harvesting resources and the detection and response to intrusion . on one hand",
    ", the home range has to be large enough to meet energy requirements ; on the other , it has to be small enough for the resident to be protected from intrusions of same - species foraging neighbours  @xcite .",
    "the importance of learning about home ranges stems not only from the intellectual need to understand animal movement  @xcite , but also from the practical value in the determination of the size of the home range : it is intimately related to a variety of ecological phenomena ranging from social organization to mating behavior and disease transmission  @xcite .",
    "there is already a body of biological literature on home ranges and related animal movements  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to build upon that literature to provide a comprehensive mathematical description of the dynamics of ecological systems .",
    "given the spatial probability distribution for an individual , the home range size has been typically defined as the contour that contains a fixed percentage ( usually 95% ) of the total volume under the distribution  @xcite .",
    "home range size can be estimated from data of recorded locations over a sufficiently large period of time .",
    "these data can be obtained through a variety of methods including radio tracking and live trapping .",
    "different techniques have been proposed for estimating home range size from location data of _ single _ animals ( see e.g. the review by  @xcite ) .",
    "the various approaches can be divided into three categories . in the first",
    ", estimates are made using the peripheral points of the location data . in the second",
    ", the data are fitted to a pre - assumed probability distribution . in the third ,",
    "the probability distribution is determined only from the statistical properties of the data ( such as the one proposed by  @xcite ) .",
    "the first method gives the maximum extent of the animal s range while the other two methods give a profile of the probability distribution inside the home range .    in order to obtain reasonable accuracy ,",
    "all three procedures have the requirement that the number of locations recorded for each animal be large  @xcite . unless unusual efforts are made during the field sampling , the number of locations for each individual is typically not very large ( e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of individuals is typically quite large .",
    "home range estimation from location data of _ many _ individuals , therefore , avoids such problems  @xcite : the positions are averaged over all the animals recorded .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop a theoretical model which gives a simple prescription for the extraction of home range parameters from location data of animal population inside a limited region of space .",
    "such a limited window of observation represents , for example , the size of the trapping array in a mark - recapture experiment , in which an animal is captured , tagged and then recorded every time it is recaptured  @xcite .    in the model",
    "we suggest , the motion of each animal is represented by diffusion in a confining potential , the latter representing the attraction of the animal to the home - place , the burrow .",
    "the potential has a characteristic width associated with the size of the home range , which we call @xmath0 .",
    "the underlying equation in our approach is the fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution for each individual  @xcite .",
    "the stationary solution of this fokker - planck equation is used to calculate the infinite - time limit of the mean square displacement saturation value of all the individuals as function of @xmath0 .",
    "comparison with the measured mean square displacement allows then the determination of the home range size , expressed here in units of length .",
    "the home range size has been typically denoted in the literature in term of an area .",
    "the relation to our description is simply that that area is given by the product of @xmath0 for the two directions .",
    "application of our procedure to rodent measurements in panama and in new mexico may be found in  @xcite where our model in its simplest form has been successfully used to extract not only home range sizes but also diffusion constants from mark - recaptures of rodent populations .",
    "the practical output of our present theoretical procedure is a saturation curve for the observed mean square displacement as a function of @xmath1 , the ratio of the home range to @xmath2 , a length that is characteristic of the size of the observation window .",
    "we predict a sigmoid shape for the saturation curve .",
    "an immediate consequence is that , for the greatest accuracy in the measurement of the home range , the observation window should be of the order of the home range . for certain potentials it is possible to write down simple analytical expressions for the saturation curve . for others",
    "the curve is obtained through numerical computation .",
    "our theory also addresses the distribution of home ranges according to habitat , equivalently home range overlap , a quantity independently accessible through allometric scaling arguments  @xcite .",

    "the exclusivity of space use has recently been found to obey an allometric scaling relation with the animal mass by  @xcite .",
    "the present theory provides a method to determine both the home range size and the home range overlap , and thus to verify the scaling of these and related magnitudes  @xcite .",
    "home range sizes have been often deduced from the measurement of the so - called minimum convex polygon of an animal position .",
    "although this procedure suffers from a number of drawbacks @xcite , it is used rather widely . among its drawbacks",
    "it is easy to recognize at least a logical and a methodological one .",
    "the surveyed perimeter provides no information about the use of space inside it , effectively encompassing areas that may be inaccessible to the animal , or potentially huge areas of very low frequency of utilization .",
    "the methodological one is the fact that the measured area converges very slowly to the actual home range , and as such the observation of a few tens of positions provides a very bad estimation .",
    "both kinds of flaws have been recognized in the literature before ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and suggestions have been made to compensate for them .",
    "these proposals , such as discarding some fraction of the extreme positions from a set of observations to compensate for the first , or to join the perimetral points in a fashion different from the minimum convex polygon , are surely arbitrary . furthermore , methodologically , they are obviously subject to uncontrollable errors .    in the following",
    "we illustrate how the calculation of the mean square displacement we have given in the present paper provides a rapidly converging measurement of the home range size .",
    "this is an additional advantage when displacements of animals belonging to a population are more readily accessible than repeated measurements of the position of individual animals . for the sake of the illustration",
    ", we will consider that the probability of space use of an animal is a bivariate gaussian distribution of variance @xmath82 : @xmath108 we consider this symmetric distribution for simplicity , but the discussion applies equally to a distribution with anisotropic @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , the conclusions are equivalent for more general distributions , including those with a finite cut - off .",
    "if we define the home range of the animal whose space use distribution is described by ( [ gaussian2d ] ) as the area @xmath101 that contains the 95% of @xmath109  @xcite , a simple integration gives @xmath110 this the quantity that we intend to measure by both methods . in fig .",
    "[ polygon ] we show the area of the minimum convex polygon defined by a set of @xmath111 points drawn at random with a bivariate gaussian distribution of @xmath112 .",
    "observe , firstly , that the area grows unboundedly as the number of observations grows , since @xmath109 is unbounded .",
    "more relevant from the practical point of view is the fact that the growth is very slowly , and that the area @xmath101 ( obtained with 95% rule and marked in fig .",
    "[ polygon ] with an arrow ) is achieved after the observation contains , on average , 135 points ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ polygon ] ) .    now consider that one wants to determine @xmath101 by measuring _",
    "displacements _ , instead of positions .",
    "the relevant quantity to be estimated is the variance @xmath82 , immediately derived from the home range size @xmath0 , accessible through our present theory explained in sec .",
    "[ sec - msd ] . expression ( [ hrsize ] ) gives then the home range area .",
    "figure [ sigma ] shows that the measurement of the variance , @xmath113 , for a finite set of @xmath111 observations , converges very rapidly to the actual value ( which is 1 in this case ) , when the number of observations is increased .",
    "indeed , with just 10 observations of the displacement the variance can be estimated with an accuracy greater than 95% .",
    "ten displacements correspond to just 11 positions of a single animal , if taken at intervals long enough that they are uncorrelated , or 10 displacements of different animals for which an average distribution would be found .    in summary ,",
    "the mean square displacement provides a faster convergence to the area of the home range than the construction of the convex polygon . in addition",
    ", the estimation of the distribution @xmath109 ( unimodal in this case , but easily generalizable ) by that method provides information about the use of the home range , which is inaccessible to the convex polygon procedure .",
    "the determination of home range dimensions and spatial overlap of two neighbouring home ranges from field observation is a subject of great interest for the understanding of animal motion .",
    "we have provided here a general theory to extract such demographic parameters on the basis of the measurement of displacements of individual animals in a population .    the most common techniques for gathering information of home range size employ trapping of animal and radiotelemetry observations .",
    "our theory in the present paper has been constructed with the specific goal of interpreting data obtained from the former type of observation , i.e. , mark - recapture experiments , in which the sampling area is finite .",
    "the motion of an animal inside its own home range has been modeled by a fokker - planck equation ( [ fpeq ] ) , i.e. by diffusion in a confining potential @xmath6 .",
    "while the equations considered are , for simplicity , 1-dimensional , extension to higher dimensions is straightforward and unnecessary for practical purposes .",
    "even though the precise determination of the home range size @xmath0 depends on the choice of the potential @xmath6 , the general sigmoid shape of the saturation curve in our theory indicates that the difference in the results is not substantial if the window size is chosen such that @xmath114 .",
    "eventually , the choice of the right potential is to be determined for each given case , on the basis of biological information of the animal population under study .",
    "we have shown that , for those situations in which the second moment of the distribution @xmath115 is not finite , the saturation curve for large @xmath2 grows linearly with @xmath0 rather than quadratically as in more conventional potentials ( box or harmonic ) .",
    "such cases may arise when the animal motion is not simple but involve a more complicated random walk such as a levi walk or flight .",
    "this means that our theory of mark - recapture observation may be used , in principle , to determine whether the animal population is performing a gaussian random walk or a more complicated walk . by measuring the mean square displacement at saturation with different values of the probe length @xmath2 ( sufficiently lager than @xmath0 ) it might be possible to determine if the saturation curve grows quadratically or linearly .    the obtained parameters that characterize the average use of space , when obtained via mark - recapture observations and their interpretation with our present theory , converge rapidly to the expected values .",
    "we have shown in sec .",
    "[ sec - poly ] that this is not the case in the application of the traditional minimum convex polygon method .",
    "we thus suggest that displacement measurements of an animal population should be considered as the most appropriate way for determining home range dimensions if radiotelemetry methods are not available .",
    "the other important demographic parameter that can be extracted from mark - recapture measurements is the inter - home characteristic distance of the animals , called @xmath85 in the present paper .",
    "such a length is simply related to the mean overlap ( or the mean exclusivity of space usage ) .",
    "we have outlined a procedure to extract this parameter quantitatively from mark - recapture observations and provided a general way to verify directly from mark - recapture experiments the scaling of home range overlap as function of body mass .",
