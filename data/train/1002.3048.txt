    "the expansion of the pqcd into the domain of the small @xmath8 processes requires accounting for the large double logarithmic terms @xmath9 .",
    "this can be done within the double logarithmic approximation ( dla ) which follows from the dglap evolution dynamics .",
    "single logarithmic terms @xmath10 arising from gluon radiation in multi regge kinematics are accounted for in the competing perturbative pomeron approximation .",
    "the latter approximation includes the lo double logarithmic terms also @xcite but neglects the running of the coupling constant .",
    "the interrelation between these approximations has been understood recently and led to the resummation models @xcite . in the resummation models",
    "the onset of the perturbative pomeron occurs at extremely large energies .",
    "the dglap evolution equation gives a good description of the hera data on the structure function @xmath11 @xcite and the cross sections of hard exclusive processes observed at hera @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the hard inelastic diffractive ( hid ) processes with large momentum transfer @xmath7 and large rapidity gap , like @xmath12 ( fig.1 ) , that were studied at hera recently @xcite .",
    "we show that the specific model independent properties of the dglap approximation which are absent in the pqcd calculations of pomeron at large @xmath7 ( cf",
    "@xcite ) allow to describe the hera data .    in the dglap approximation the amplitudes are rapidly increasing with energy since the @xmath13 terms that define the energy dependence of the amplitudes ,",
    "are multiplied by large logarithms that arise from the integration over parton transverse momenta .",
    "consider now the diffraction processes with large momentum transfer defined above .",
    "it was understood recently @xcite that cross section for diffractive vector meson photoproduction from a parton does not increase with energy for @xmath14 in striking contrast with rapid increase of this cross section at @xmath15 since logs arising from the integration over parton transverse momenta are @xmath16 , and thus disappear at @xmath17 .",
    "the quantitative theory of such phenomena was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also brief discussion below .",
    "this result is valid in all orders of dglap approximation and thus the cross section of diffractive charmonium production off a parton is energy independent at large @xmath7 .",
    "the cross section of the hid processes depends on energy at large @xmath7 , since the kinematic range of the allowed invariant masses @xmath18 is increasing with energy i.e. due to the fragmentation of the knocked out parton .",
    "parton fragmentation is described by the parton distribution function in a proton , see fig .",
    "the dependence of this increase rate on @xmath7 is due to the strong dependence of the rate of increase of the gluon structure function @xmath19 on @xmath20 .",
    "the increase of this rate with @xmath20 has been predicted within the dglap approximation , and observed at hera .",
    "indeed , if we parametrize @xmath21 , the exponent @xmath22 is increasing with virtuality @xmath23 for @xmath24 , and even more rapidly for larger @xmath8 @xcite . this property is absent within the concept of the pomeron exchange .",
    "we find that it is this property that explains the recent hera data on large@xmath7 diffraction -see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the dominance of double logarithmic terms in a wide kinematic region in the double scale processes , shows that the multiregge dynamics could be revealed in the very special one scale processes where the @xmath20 evolution is suppressed .",
    "the large @xmath7 ultraperipheral processes at lhc represent an example of such phenomena .",
    "we explain that in the kinematical range @xmath25 the double logarithmic ( dl ) terms are absent .",
    "so the hid phenomena represent a golden plated process for uncovering the onset of the pqcd pomeron .",
    "switching from hera to ultraperipheral processes at lhc significantly increases the kinematical window allowed for the multiregge kinematics . in this case",
    "it is possible to select kinematics where a dipole scatters of partons with rather large @xmath8 , with up to 9 @xmath2610 units in rapidity available for the gluons within the multiregge kinematics .",
    "an unambiguous signature of these gluons will be a rapid increase of the diffractive cross section with energy in the region where dglap predicts the energy independent cross section .",
    "the amplitude for the exclusive process : @xmath27 at nonzero @xmath5 was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite long ago .",
    "recent derivation of amplitudes of hard diffractive processes within dglap approximation in @xcite led to the significantly different dependence of these amplitudes on @xmath28 and on the collision energy , cf .",
    "the discussion in the end of the paper .",
    "the formulae for the cross sections of diffractive photoproduction of @xmath29 off proton target have been suggested also in ref .",
    "@xcite within the dipole model generalized to include screening corrections and the processes of proton dissociation .",
    "these formulae differ from the ones which follow from the qcd factorization theorem and dglap approximation @xcite .",
    "they do not include photon scattering off a parton and its further fragmentation , and do not correspond to the triple `` pomeron '' limit . as a result ,",
    "the obtained dependence on the collision energy and on the hadron mass produced in the proton fragmentation significantly differs from the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "the dependence of qcd evolution on @xmath5 is in variance with the dependence of amplitudes on the running coupling constant within the dglap approximation derived in ref .",
    "the dependence of cross sections on the incident energy suggested in the model of @xcite contradicts to experimental data , cf .",

    "the letter is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we compare the predictions of the dglap approximation for hid processes with the experimental data at hera and show that predicted within dglap approximation increase with @xmath7 of the dependence of the cross section on energy is in a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "note , that the indications of the slowing down of the energy dependence of the cross section of hid off gluon were first found in the analysis of experimental data in ref .",
    "@xcite where dependence on energy of elastic amplitude for the photo(electro ) production processes off gluon was considered as a fitting parameter . in section iii we present illustrative estimate of the possible effects of multiregge dynamics in the ultraperipheral processes at lhc in the regime @xmath30 . in section",
    "iv we discuss the implications of our results for the study of the generalized parton distribution functions ( gpdf ) .",
    "the pqcd description of hid processes was recently developed in ref .",
    "the differential cross section in the kinematic range @xmath31 was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and is given by the following formula : .",
    "= ( t , q^2,m^2_v)^2g(x_j , t ) .",
    "[ fe ] here @xmath32 x_j&=&-t/(m^2_x - m^2_p - t),x\\sim 3(q^2+m^2_v)/(2s ) , \\ , b=11 - 2/3n_f , n_c=3 , s = w^2_{\\gamma p}\\nonumber\\\\[10pt ] \\label{fe1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factor @xmath33 in eq .",
    "[ fe ] is the energy independent function , which depends on the details of the wave functions of the produced quarkonium and a photon .",
    "the second factor corresponds to the distribution of gluons in a parton , calculated in the dl approximation , the last factor in eq .",
    "[ fe ] is the gluon structure function of the nucleon that can be calculated using e.g. cteq6 data ( we neglect small contribution of the quark sea ) .",
    "the function @xmath34 is the modified bessel function . in this equation @xmath18",
    "is the invariant mass of the hadronic system produced due to the diffractive dissociation of a proton ( see fig .  1 ) , @xmath35 mev , and @xmath7 is the transverse momentum transfer . for the photoproduction processes we are going to discuss in this letter",
    "the external photon is real : @xmath36 and @xmath37 to ensure presence of hard scale already for small @xmath5 and to avoid the end point contribution which are present for the light vector meson production .",
    "this energy dependence is the same for photoproduction of longitudinally and transversely polarized onium states .",
    "let us stress two characteristic features of eq .",
    "one is that at small @xmath7 close to zero the rate of the increase of the cross section with energy is @xmath38 double of the rate of the increase of the gluon density .",
    "second is the absence of the energy dependence at @xmath39 and approximately the same as for the exclusive @xmath29 production .",
    "indeed , for @xmath15 we obtain @xmath40 , i.e. the energy dependence is proportional to @xmath41 , instead @xmath42 for the case of the total cross section , with the same @xmath43 . on the other hand for @xmath30 and",
    "fixed @xmath44 cross section is independent on energy in arbitrary order of dglap approximation : = const .",
    "[ pe ]    let us compare now the theoretical prediction with the recent experimental data .",
    "this comparison , as it was first noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , is not straightforward , since the hera experiments , see e.g. @xcite , report the integral over invariant masses : @xmath45 a(s)&= & 0.05s - t , b(s ) = 1~ \\rm{gev}^2,\\nonumber\\\\[10pt ]   \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we changed the integration variable from @xmath44 to @xmath18 .",
    "the characteristic feature of eq . [ 1 ] is that the dependence on energy of the cross section comes from two sources .",
    "one is the differential cross section for photon scattering off gluon eq .",
    "[ fe ] , but also from the dependence on @xmath6 of the integration limits over @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath47 and the energy dependence of the cross section of photo ( electro)production of vector meson from gluon target is absent , the dependence on energy of the experimentally measured quantity is given by = u(t)^a(s)_b(s)g((-t/(m^2_x - t),t)dm^2_x.[12 ] here @xmath48 is an energy independent function that can be expressed through the function @xmath49 in eq .",
    "thus the kinematic restrictions depend on the collision energy leading to the energy dependent cross section . as we already mentioned in the introduction , both the hera data and dglap results for the gluon structure function show , that it increases with the increase of the gluon virtuality @xmath20 starting already from @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "this property of the structure functions immediately translates into a steeper energy dependence of @xmath51 given by eq .",
    "[ 12 ] with the increase of @xmath7 . in order to compare the theoretical prediction with the experimental data we calculated the integral [ 1 ] numerically for all @xmath7 .",
    "we use the gluon structure function given by cteq6l and cteq6 m , leading to only small differences .",
    "we present the main results of our calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in order to compare with the experimental data we calculate the logarithmic derivative i(s , t)=d(d / dt)/d log(s)[21 ] for @xmath52 gev@xmath53 ( we denote this quantity as @xmath54 , and compare it with the data for @xmath55 presented in fig .  9 in ref .",
    "it is referred to in ref . @xcite as the `` pomeron '' trajectory @xmath56 .",
    "we present our results calculated using eqs .",
    "[ fe],[12 ] at fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and compared them with the experimental data as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the calculation",
    "we use cteq6 m and cteq6l gluon structure function @xmath57 , and neglect small contribution of the quark sea .",
    "we depict the curves for small @xmath7 ( @xmath58 gev@xmath53 ) for such `` effective pomeron '' by the dashed lines , since for these @xmath7 the integration region includes the range of @xmath59 , where nondiagonal ( gpd ) effects may be important .",
    "in addition , the gluon distribution function is subject to significant uncertainties .",
    "the results are clearly within the experimental errors . for comparison",
    "we also depict in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the logarithmic derivative of the double differential cross section [ fe ] at this energy , that corresponds to the `` true '' pomeron in the triple pomeron limit which enters in eq .",
    "[ fe ] .",
    "existing calculations of cross sections of large @xmath5 diffractive processes within perturbative pomeron hypothesis , cf @xcite predict qualitatively different interplay of @xmath5 and @xmath60 dependence .",
    "in particular , in difference from the dglap approximation they predicted that dependence on energy of gluon structure function of proton should be independent on @xmath20 . secondly perturbative pomeron `` trajectory ''",
    "weakly depends on @xmath5 as @xmath61 , cf . @xcite . as a result perturbative pomeron calculations predict the decrease with @xmath7 of the energy dependence of the cross section of @xmath62 .",
    "this prediction is in variance with the hera data @xcite .",
    "observation that the pqcd pomeron regime does not set in for the hera kinematics can be understood as the consequence of the constraints due to the energy - momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the concept of the pqcd pomeron is based on the assumption of the dominance of the gluon radiation in the multiregge kinematics at high energies",
    ". however there must be at least 2@xmath632.5 units in rapidity for each gluon radiation .",
    "this means that for the radiation of even one gluon in the multiregge kinematics a rapidity window of at least 4@xmath635 units in rapidity is required .",
    "one should add to this interval the interval in rapidity characteristic for the fragmentation regions .",
    "at least 2@xmath632.5 units due to photon fragmentation plus region in rapidity occupied by dl terms and larger than 2@xmath632.5 units interval for the proton fragmentation ( proton fragmentation into small masses is suppressed by the power of @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus it seems that there is no room in the hera kinematics for the gluon radiation in the multiregge kinematics . on the contrary dglap approximation",
    "conserves longitudinal momentum , and double logarithmic approximation is a good approximation to dglap formulae at small @xmath8 .",
    "the analysis carried in ref .",
    "@xcite within the resummation models has found also that the kernel ( the amplitude for scattering of the gluon off a parton ) is well described within the dglap approximation for reasonable values of @xmath64 gev@xmath53 , up to @xmath65 .",
    "in fact such a good agreement between theory and experiment can be considered as an experimental verification of the energy - momentum constraints on the gluon radiation within the multiregge kinematics .",
    "consider now the ultraperipheral processes at the lhc ( for a review see @xcite ) . in this case",
    "one may have up to @xmath66 units in rapidity , i.e. up to 9 units in rapidity may be available for a ladder describing gluon - parton scattering . as we have discussed above , for moderate @xmath7 a significant part of this kinematic window",
    "will be filled by gluon radiation leading to the double logarithms .",
    "different steps of the diffractive process occupy different regions of rapidity : first interval is fragmentation of virtual photon or heavy quarkonium which is dominated by gluon radiation within double logarithmic kinematics .",
    "this range corresponds to the effective change of transverse momenta from @xmath67 in the impact factor to @xmath68 .",
    "the rest of the evolution with energy will be determined by the radiation of gluons within the multi regge kinematics , corresponding to a single - scale process , whose amplitude does not contain double logarithms.a simple estimate suggests that for small @xmath7 most of the kinematic range ( even at the lhc ) will be dominated by double logarithmes . for larger @xmath7",
    "the precise kinematic range dominated by double logarithms would be smaller and can be estimated .",
    "however , we shall not need it , if we are interested in model independent signature of gluons radiated in the multi regge kinematics . indeed , as it is clear from the previous subsection for @xmath30 the double logarithmic terms are absent , and the entire increase of the double differential cross section @xmath69 will be due to multi regge gluons . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we showed ( for illustrative purposes only , using currently popular pqcd pomeron models with intercept @xmath70 , and proportional to @xmath71 , the behavior of the @xmath69 as a function of energy .",
    "we shall see a rapid increase of cross section starting from @xmath72 .",
    "the absence of such a rise will be a sign that multi regge dynamics does not appear up to an onset of a black limit , when the pqcd is not applicable any more .",
    "note , that comparing a rate of a rise of cross section in the ultraperipheral processes on nucleon and nucleus , it is possible to find the onset of the black disk regime @xcite .",
    "the necessity to account for the dl terms in the qcd evolution at small x has important implications for the interpretation of the energy dependence of the @xmath7 slope for exclusive vector meson production , dvcs studied at hera .",
    "indeed the factorization theorem @xcite which allows to express the amplitude through the convolution of the photon and the vector meson wave functions and the generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) was proven in the limit @xmath73 . in the limit when @xmath7 is compared to @xmath74 it requires modifications because of disappearance of the difference in the scales .    for @xmath75 close to zero the dglap evolution of @xmath76 which is present at the boundary condition leads to a rather slow variation of @xmath76 with @xmath20 @xcite .    to be able to compare with experimental data for @xmath77 we approximate the amplitude as @xmath78 and estimate : @xmath79 note that the analysis of the @xmath80 exclusive photoproduction suggests the effective scale of the order @xmath81 leading to @xmath82    the estimate of eq.[est ] should be compared to the experimental numbers measured at hera by zeus@xcite and h1@xcite collaborations which agree well with each other .",
    "for example , in case of photoproduction zeus reported @xmath83 with @xmath84 for the last two points at @xmath85 consistent with one .",
    "it is of interest also that the zeus and h1 experimental data do not contradict a a smaller value of @xmath86 for electroproduction of @xmath29 . in particular zeus reports for @xmath87 - @xmath88 which is consistent with the pattern expected for the discussed effect .",
    "the studies of 3d image of the nucleon at small x require in the exclusive @xmath29 production require reaching @xmath89 in order to probe the gluon density at small impact parameters .",
    "it follows from our discussion that reaching the range of applicability of the factorization theorem @xcite will require @xmath20 of the order of 10 gev@xmath53 .",
    "we have shown that dglap predictions are in a good agreement with the behavior of hid processes observed at hera .",
    "we found that the ultraperipheral collisions at lhc are a unique place where the onset of gluon radiation in the multiregge kinematics may be observed in the near future .",
