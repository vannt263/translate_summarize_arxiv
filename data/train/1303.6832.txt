    "in this two - part work we are interested in the way a solid immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid ( in dimension 2 or 3 ) can deform itself and then interact with the environing fluid in order to stabilize exponentially to zero the velocity of the fluid and also its own velocities . the domain occupied by the solid at time @xmath0",

    "the angular velocity is a vector field whereas it is only a scalar function in dimension 2 .",
    "however , @xmath11 can be immersed in @xmath12 and this scalar function can be read on the third component of a 3d - vector . more generally in this work , since all the calculations made in dimension 3 make sense in dimension 2 , we will consider only vector fields of @xmath12 and matrix fields of @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are related to each other through the following cauchy problem @xmath16 will represent the identity matrix of @xmath13.]where in dimension 2 we have @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "this latter represents the deformation of the solid in its own frame of reference and is considered as the control function on which we can act physically .",
    "when this lagrangian mapping @xmath20 is invertible , we can link to it an eulerian velocity @xmath21 through the following cauchy problem @xmath22 without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath23 , for a sake of simplicity . if @xmath24 denotes the inverse of @xmath20 , we have @xmath25 the fluid flow is described by its velocity @xmath26 and its pressure @xmath27 which are assumed to satisfy the incompressible navier - stokes equations . for @xmath28 satisfying a set of hypotheses given further , the system which governs the dynamics between the fluid and the solid is the following @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and where the velocity @xmath34 is defined by the following change of frame @xmath35 the symbol @xmath36 denotes the cross product in @xmath12 .",

    "the inertia moment is a scalar function which can be read on the inertia matrix given by @xmath40 in dimension 3 it is a tensor written as @xmath41 the quantity @xmath42 denotes the density of the solid , and obeys the principle of mass conservation @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the jacobian matrix of the mapping @xmath5 . for a sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that the solid is homogeneous at time @xmath45 : @xmath46 in system  , @xmath47 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and the normalized vector @xmath48 is the normal at @xmath49 exterior to @xmath50 .",
    "it is a coupled system between the incompressible navier - stokes equations and the differential equations - given by the newton s laws .",
    "the coupling is in particular made in the fluid - structure interface , through the equality of velocities and through the cauchy stress tensor given by @xmath51 indeed , the dirichlet condition partially imposed by the deformation of the solid ( through the velocity @xmath34 ) influences the behavior of the fluid whose the response is the quantity @xmath52 in the fluid - solid interface . it represents the force that the fluid applies on the solid , and then it determines the global dynamics of the solid ( through equations et ) and thus its position .",
    "+ the problem is the following : what is the deformation @xmath28 of the solid we have to impose in order to stabilize the environing fluid and thus induce a behavior of the fluid which stabilizes the velocities of the solid ?",
    "we shall assume a set of hypotheses on the control function @xmath28 , that we state as follows :    h1 : :    for all @xmath53 , @xmath20 is a    @xmath54-diffeomorphism from @xmath55    onto @xmath56 .",

    "the existence of global - in - time strong solutions for system  has been studied in @xcite in dimension 2 and more recently in @xcite in dimension 3 . in particular , this existence in dimension 3 is conditioned by the smallness of the data , namely the initial condition @xmath61 and the displacement of the solid @xmath62 will represent the identity mapping of @xmath63 . ] ( in some sobolev spaces ) .      for the full nonlinear system  , the equations are written in the eulerian configuration , and thus we are lead to think that the eulerian velocity @xmath21 is the more suitable quantity to be chosen as a control function ( instead of @xmath28 ) .",
    "but such a mapping is defined on the domain @xmath64 , which is itself defined by @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , the study of such a nonlinear system is based on the preliminary study of the corresponding linearized system which is @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 and where the more suitable control to be chosen is the function @xmath69 , related to the lagrangian velocity @xmath70 by @xmath71 notice that the constraints and are nonlinear with respect to the mapping @xmath28 .",
    "we linearize them when we consider the linear system . for this linear system , the constraint induced by hypothesis * h1 * can be relaxed , since we only consider mappings @xmath72 continuous in time and such that @xmath73 .",
    "thus the notion of _ admissible control _ for this linearized problem is made precise in definition [ deflincontrol ] .",
    "the main result of this first part is theorem [ thstablinx ] , which is equivalent to the following one :    assume that @xmath74 . for all @xmath61 satisfying @xmath75 and the following compatibility conditions @xmath76 system  is stabilizable with an arbitrary exponential decay rate @xmath77 , that is to say that for all @xmath78 there exists a boundary control @xmath79 and a positive constant c , @xmath80 or @xmath81 will denote some generic positive constants which do not depend on time or on the unknowns .",
    "] depending only on @xmath61 such that for all @xmath82 the solution @xmath83 of system  satisfies @xmath84    for proving this theorem we study the system that has to satisfy the functions @xmath85 and the goal is then to prove that there exists a control @xmath69 such that this system admits a solution @xmath86 bounded in some infinite time horizon space .",
    "the strategy we follow is globally the same as the one used in @xcite , at least for the linearized problem .",
    "it first consists in rewriting the full nonlinear system in space domains which do not depend on time anymore , by using a change of variables and a change of unknowns",
    ". then we can make appear all the nonlinearities ( specially those which are due to the variations of the geometry through the time ) and we can set properly the linearized system .",
    "the second step of the proof consists in formulating the linearized system in terms of operators where the pressure is actually eliminated and encodes a _ mass - added effect_. this writing enables us to define an analytic semigroup of contraction generated by an operator which presents interesting spectral properties : indeed the unstable modes that we have to stabilize are actually countable and in finite number . besides , we prove by a unique continuation argument the approximate controllability of this linearized system .",
    "thus , in order to define the boundary control that stabilizes the full linearized system , it is sufficient to consider a finite - dimension linear system for which the approximate controllability is equivalent to the feedback stabilizability .",
    "the aforementioned control can be defined on a finite - dimension space in a feedback operator form , what will be useful for proving the stabilization of the full nonlinear system . + with regards to the methods , a novelty is the means provided in a last section which enables us to define from a boundary control an internal deformation satisfying the linearized constraints .",
    "this result too will be useful for the definition of a deformation of the solid - which has to satisfy the nonlinear constraints - that stabilizes the nonlinear system : considering a deformation which satisfies in a first time the linearized constraints is not necessarily from a mathematical point of view , but the method with which we obtain it will be important for defining a deformation satisfying the nonlinear constraints ( see section 5 of part ii ) ; besides , from a physical point of view , considering for the linearized system a deformation which satisfies the linear constraints is relevant since it ensures the conservation of the momenta for the whole fluid - solid linear system .",
    "+ the idea of considering first the linearized problem relies on the fact that for small perturbations ( that is to say for small initial conditions @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) the behavior of the nonlinear system is close to the one of the linearized system .",
    "+   + thus the same statement will be proven in the second part of this work for the unknowns of the full nonlinear system . the result is nonintuitive : it says somewhat that all the fluid in which the solid swims can be stabilized just by the help of this swimmer , at an intermediate reynolds number .",
    "this kind of problem has been investigated in @xcite for instance , where it is considered other types of fluid - swimmer systems .",
    "the same kind of purpose has been also investigated at a low reynolds number in @xcite and more recently in @xcite , for the stokes system , and in @xcite in the case of a perfect fluid .",
    "the control of the motion of a boat at a high reynolds number has been recently studied in @xcite . besides",
    ", the same kind of techniques that we use in this work have been used for other coupled systems involving the incompressible navier - stokes equations ; let us cite @xcite and @xcite for instance , where the stabilization of other fluid - structure problems is proven .",
    "definitions and notation are given in section [ secdef ] .",
    "the linearized system is studied in section [ linearsec ] where it is rewritten through an operator formulation for which we prove useful properties .",
    "the approximate controllability of this linearized system is proven in section [ secapproxcont ] .",
    "it leads to the main result of this paper , namely the feedback stabilization of the linearized system in section [ secfeedback ] .",
    "finally in section [ secahah ] we provide a means to recover an internal deformation of the solid from a feedback boundary control which lives only in the fluid - solid interface .",
    "this final section is the transition to the second part of this work where the considered control is an internal deformation of the solid .",
    "we denote by @xmath90 the domain occupied by the fluid at time @xmath45 , and by @xmath91 the domain occupied by the solid at @xmath45 .",

    "<S> this paper is the first part of a work which consists in proving the stabilization to zero of a fluid - solid system , in dimension 2 and 3 . the considered system couples a deformable solid and a viscous incompressible fluid which satisfies the incompressible navier - stokes equations . by deforming itself </S>",
    "<S> , the solid can interact with the environing fluid and then move itself . </S>",
    "<S> the control function represents nothing else than the deformation of the solid in its own frame of reference . </S>",
    "<S> we there prove that the velocities of the linearized system are stabilizable to zero with an arbitrary exponential decay rate , by a boundary deformation velocity which can be chosen in the form of a feedback operator . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that this boundary feedback operator can be obtained from an internal deformation of the solid which satisfies the linearized physical constraints that a _ self - propelled _ solid has to satisfy .    sbastien court    ( communicated by the associate editor name ) </S>"
