    "the study of galactic evolution is a key area of observational cosmology since it is central to understanding the nature of galaxies and to probing the cosmological geometry . with observational data now revealing normal galaxies at redshifts as high as @xmath12 , we should be close to being able to locate or rule out the existence of a substantial high redshift field elliptical galaxy population .",
    "these old systems would have formed at the earliest times , and hence their existence would place very stringent constraints on galaxy and structure formation .    how elliptical galaxies form remains a topic of debate .",
    "the standard view ( e.g.  eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ; tinsley & gunn 1976 ) has been that elliptical galaxies formed the bulk of their stars in a single burst of star formation at high redshift , after which their stellar populations evolved passively .",
    "this monolithic collapse model for elliptical formation is in marked contrast with the hierarchical merging scenario for galaxy formation and evolution in which massive galaxies form at all redshifts from the gradual merging of smaller galaxies ( e.g.   white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; baugh et al .",
    "the monolithic collapse model appears to be supported by extensive studies of elliptical galaxies in rich cluster environments to @xmath10 .",
    "observational studies of the color evolution in cluster early - type galaxies have demonstrated that the changes with redshift are consistent with a model in which stellar populations formed at high redshift , @xmath13 , and subsequently evolved passively ( e.g.  aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "a similar @xmath13 constraint is obtained from the observed small scatter in the color - magnitude relations in distant clusters ( e.g.  ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1995 , 1998 ) , and from the evolution of the mgb versus @xmath14 relation ( e.g.  ziegler & bender 1997 ) and the fundamental plane relation ( e.g.  van dokkum & franx 1996 ; kelson et al .",
    "however , kauffmann & charlot ( 1998 ) have argued that in the rich cluster environment hierarchical elliptical galaxy evolution may appear indistinguishable from that predicted by the passive evolution scenario . in their model , rich clusters at high redshift correspond to regions where the very earliest star formation occurred , and hence the star formation and merging histories of galaxies in these clusters have progressed much further than have those of field galaxies .",
    "thus , in observing apparently similar clusters of galaxies , observers may be selecting only the oldest galaxies at any particular redshift .",
    "because the passive evolution scenario for elliptical galaxies predicts a population of @xmath10 galaxies with ultrared optical - near - ir colors , this scenario can be sensitively tested in the field environment with very deep optical and near - infrared imaging surveys .",
    "low - redshift galaxies with significant star formation can mimic the very red colors of an evolved elliptical if they are greatly reddened by dust , but the number of ultrared objects observed gives an _ upper _ limit on the comoving number density of passively evolving elliptical galaxies , provided that there does not exist a population of completely dust - obscured high redshift objects .",
    "imaging surveys have only recently become deep enough in both the optical and the near - ir bands to test for the presence of ultrared galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "cowie et al .  (",

    "arcmin@xmath2 which they later followed up spectroscopically ( songaila et al .",
    "1994 ) . from their data they found that the space density of extremely red objects having @xmath17 , the expected color for old stellar populations at @xmath10 , implied that at most ten per cent of the total local galaxy population could have formed in early single - starburst events .",
    "a comparison of their @xmath18 sample with a wider , brighter sample having @xmath19 also showed a scarcity of very red objects which could lie at redshifts @xmath10 .",
    "thus , cowie et al .  suggested that either galaxies are less luminous at these higher redshifts or the mix of galaxy types is much bluer than expected .",

    "most of their sources had colors consistent with either old stellar populations observed at @xmath22 or younger populations observed over a wide range of redshifts .",

    "arcmin@xmath2 . they found a small population of galaxies in their sample whose infrared bright ( @xmath17 ) but relatively blue optical ( @xmath26 ) colors could not be reproduced with any of their standard models .",
    "moustakas et al.suggested three possible scenarios to explain these ` red outliers ' , namely ( i)a universal event of secondary bursts in @xmath27 passively evolving elliptical galaxies , ( ii)a combination of very low metallicity and substantial reddening in @xmath28 galaxies , or ( iii)the existence of dusty , old populations within the galactic nuclei of normal galaxies . in their preliminary follow - up analysis , moustakas et al .",
    "( 1998 ) presented _ hst _ wfpc2 and nicmos morphologies for some of their red outliers .",
    "these images showed the objects to be compact and asymmetric and hence unlikely to be relaxed systems .",
    "thus , these authors now prefer the explanation that the red outlier population consists of very dusty @xmath29 systems containing bright nuclei powered by either agns or starbursts . in the present paper",
    "we find that such objects are much rarer than was measured by moustakas et al .",
    "the results of the above three surveys , as well as those from recent @xmath15-band hdf imaging by dickinson et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , were subsequently analyzed by zepf ( 1997 ) in an effort to determine the dominant formation mechanism for elliptical galaxies .",
    "zepf compared the observed surface densities of the ultrared galaxies to a given magnitude limit with their expected surface densities , assuming a passive formation model in which all early - type galaxies form in short bursts at high redshift .",
    "he concluded that there is a strong deficit of galaxies with extremely red colors in the observed fields ( therefore ruling out models where typical ellipticals are fully assembled and have formed all of their stars by @xmath30 ) , and thus that most ellipticals must have formed at @xmath31 through merging and associated starbursts .    using the hdf dataset of dickinson et al .",

    "( 1998 ) analyzed the spectral energy distributions of morphological ellipticals in the hdf to date the dominant stellar populations .",
    "they found that the majority of the bright early - types were at @xmath32 and had colors which indicated ages of typically @xmath33  gyr .",
    "the sudden disappearance of objects at @xmath34 , when the objects should have been visible in a luminous star - formation phase , is explained by franceschini et al .   as being due to the fact that during the first few gyrs of the galaxy s lifetime the objects are undergoing dust - enshrouded merger - driven starbursts .",
    "provided that high redshift ellipticals are not completely obscured by dust , deep infrared surveys can detect their presence and place constraints on their surface density .",
    "existing deep @xmath15-band surveys have concentrated on small areas due to the small format of the ir arrays . however , with the development of large - format ir arrays such as the hawaii ( @xmath35 ) hgcdte devices , it is now feasible to conduct deep near - infrared surveys over wider fields . in this paper",
    "we present a wide - field @xmath0 survey of the hdf and its flanking fields ( ffs ) with corresponding @xmath7 and @xmath8 colors .",

    "an alternative approach is to place an upper limit on the number density of high - redshift evolved elliptical galaxies using very deep imaging at optical and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the present very large area survey allows us to place limits on the population of @xmath10 galaxies having ultrared optical - near - ir colors . in order to compare our results with previous @xmath15-band surveys ,",

    "we have surveyed ( @xmath133 ) , we detect only 16 galaxies with galaxy colors @xmath17 . in the 7.8  arcmin@xmath2 area of our deep hdf survey ( @xmath134 ) , we detect 4 galaxies with colors @xmath17 ; there are , however , an additional 5 galaxies with only @xmath135 limits on their @xmath8 magnitudes which could move into the ultrared region . in table  [ tabfraction ] we compare the fraction of objects ( 12/290 ) with @xmath17 in the inclusive magnitude range @xmath136 in our wide - field sample and the fraction of objects ( 4 - 9/81 ) with @xmath17 in the inclusive magnitude range @xmath137 in our deep sample with the results of cowie et al .",
    "due to improved photometric errors and our much larger area coverage , our wide - field determination of the fraction of ultrared galaxies in the range @xmath136 is expected to be more reliable than that obtained from smaller fields by cowie et al .",
    "our improved @xmath8-band data may also be responsible for the fact that we find a smaller fraction of ultrareds in our small field @xmath137 sample than cowie et al .",

    "we need to calculate the space density of ultrared galaxies in our wide - field sample and compare it with the space density of local ellipticals to the same magnitude limit .",
    "we assume the ultrared galaxies in our wide - field survey are distributed within the redshift range @xmath138 , corresponding to a late formation @xmath105 ( fig .",

    "these results indicate that the space density of the ultrared population is @xmath76 per cent of the space density of the local field elliptical population with @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to be aware of possible sources of systematic errors in this calculation .",
    "first , the comoving volume needed for the ultrared number density calculation depends on the model estimates of the redshift range over which @xmath17 ; the volume would be larger and @xmath159 correspondingly smaller for @xmath160 .",
    "second , the normalization of the density of the present - day luminosity function is not fully settled , with other surveys giving values that differ from the one we have used by @xmath161 per cent ( see , e.g. , the discussion in huang et al .",
    "third , a comparison with a local @xmath15-band pure - elliptical luminosity function would be preferable to the above conversion of a @xmath36-band pure - elliptical luminosity function ; such a luminosity function should soon be available ( j .- s .",
    "huang , private communication ) .",
    "fourth , the fraction of ultrareds is mildly dependent on cosmology ; the above calculation , when repeated for a @xmath106 cosmology with @xmath107 km s@xmath39 mpc@xmath39 , gives about a 10  per cent lower ratio of @xmath162 , so our @xmath84 calculation is conservative in this regard .",
    "fifth , the possibility of reddening in the high redshift sample should also be considered .",
    "if we assume that the possible reddening discussed in  [ ultrared ] applies to the entire ultrared population but not to the local population , then we find that the ratio increases by about 15  per cent . finally , although our results are from a large area survey , they are still based on a single field .",
    "this introduces a statistical uncertainty associated with field - to - field variations , particularly in a population as small as the ultrared population .",
    "results of other upcoming deep @xmath15-band surveys ( e.g.  papers in preparation by mccracken et al . , eisenhardt et al . , and barger et al .",
    ") will be useful in examining this issue .",
    "we have presented wide - field @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath0 images of the hubble deep field and flanking fields , as well as a deeper @xmath0 image of the hubble deep field .",
    "most of the objects in our sample fall within the expected regions of the @xmath77 versus @xmath78 color - color plane for blue galaxies at a range of redshifts or red elliptical galaxies at @xmath87 .",
    "significantly , no galaxies are found to follow the track of a pure k - correction elliptical at @xmath10 in either of our two samples .",
    "the track of a passive evolution model with a redshift of formation @xmath105 roughly describes the envelope of the galaxy population in the @xmath77 versus @xmath78 plane , except for a very small population of red outliers that could be dusty ellipticals in the process of formation . to an equivalent @xmath3 limit over a large 61.8  arcmin@xmath2 area",
    ", we find a surface density for @xmath17 objects of @xmath100  deg@xmath98 , which indicates that this type of object is even more rare than previous small area surveys have suggested .",
    "since an @xmath17 color could be mimicked by a highly - reddened low - redshift galaxy , this is effectively an upper limit on the population of @xmath10 ultrared galaxies , provided that there is not a population of completely dust - obscured high redshift galaxies .",
    "we find that the space density of the ultrared galaxies is only a fraction of the estimated space density of present - day field ellipticals with @xmath11 , and hence we infer that not all local field ellipticals could have formed in single bursts at high redshift .",
