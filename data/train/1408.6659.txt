    "<S> we propose a scheme to realize scalable quantum computation in a planar ion crystal confined by a paul trap . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the inevitable in - plane micromotion affects the gate design via three separate effects : renormalization of the equilibrium positions , coupling to the transverse motional modes , and amplitude modulation in the addressing beam . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that all of these effects can be taken into account and high - fidelity gates are possible in the presence of micromotion . </S>",
    "<S> this proposal opens the prospect to realize large - scale fault - tolerant quantum computation within a single paul trap .    </S>",
    "<S> scalable quantum computation constitutes one of the ultimate goals in modern physics @xcite . towards that goal , </S>",
    "<S> trapped atomic ions are hailed as one of the most promising platforms for the eventual realization @xcite . the linear paul trap with an one - dimensional ( 1d ) ion crystal was among the first to perform quantum logic gates @xcite and to generate entangled states @xcite , but in terms of scalability , the 1d geometry limits the number of ions that can be successfully trapped @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another shortcoming of the 1d architecture is that the error threshold for fault - tolerant quantum computation with short - range gates is exceptionally low and very hard to be met experimentally @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> generic ion traps , on the other hand , could confine up to millions of ions with a 2d or 3d structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more crucially , large scale fault - tolerant quantum computation can be performed with a high error threshold , in the order of a percent level , with just nearest neighbor ( nn ) quantum gates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this makes 2d or 3d ion crystals especially desirable for scalable quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> various 2d architectures have been proposed , including microtrap arrays @xcite , penning traps porras2006quantum , zou2010implementation , itano1998bragg , mitchell1998direct , and multizone trap arrays kielpinski2002architecture , monroe2013scaling . however , the ion separation distance in microtraps and penning traps is typically too large for fast quantum gates since the effective ion - qubit interaction scales down rapidly with the distance . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , fast rotation of the ion crystal in the penning trap makes the individual addressing of qubits very demanding . </S>",
    "<S> distinct from these challenges , paul traps provide strong confinement ; however , they are hampered by the micromotion problem : fast micromotion caused by the driving radio - frequency ( rf ) field can not be laser cooled . </S>",
    "<S> it may thus create motion of large amplitudes well beyond the lamb - dicke regime @xcite , which becomes a serious impediment to high - fidelity quantum gates .    in this paper , we propose a scheme for scalable quantum computation with a 2d ion crystal in a quadrupole paul trap . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown recently that micromotion may not be an obstacle for design of high - fidelity gates for the two - ion case @xcite . here , we extend this idea and show that micromotion can be explicitly taken into account in the design of quantum gates in a large ion crystal . this hence clears the critical hurdle and put paul traps as a viable architecture to realize scalable quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> in such a trap , dc and ac electrode voltages can be adjusted so that a planar ion crystal is formed with a strong trapping potential in the axial direction . in - plane </S>",
    "<S> micromotion is significant , but essentially no transverse micromotion is excited due to negligible displacement from the axial plane . </S>",
    "<S> we perform gates mediated by transverse motional modes and show that the in - plane micromotion influences the gate design through three separate ways : ( 1 ) it renormalizes the average positions of each ion compared to the static pseudopotential equilibrium positions . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) it couples to and modifies the transverse motional modes . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) it causes amplitude modulation in the addressing beam . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to thermal motion , the fluctuation induced by micromotion is coherent and can be taken into account explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> several other works also studied the effect of micromotion on equilibrium ion positions and motional modes @xcite , or used transverse modes in an oblate paul trap to minimize the micromotion effect @xcite . here , by using multiple - segment laser pulses </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we demonstrate that high - fidelity quantum gates can be achieved even in the presence of significant micromotion and even when many motional modes are excited . </S>",
    "<S> our work therefore shows the feasibility of quadrupole paul traps in performing large scale quantum computation , which may drive substantial experimental progress .    </S>",

    "<S> there is a mean phonon number @xmath110 in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane . </S>",
    "<S> it gives rise to thermal motion with average fluctuation in positions , @xmath111 m , which can be estimated as in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant gate infidelity is @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we estimate the infidelity caused by higher - order expansion in the lamb - dicke parameter . the infidelity is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the mean phonon number in the transverse direction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other than the effects considered above , micromotion may also lead to rf heating when it is coupled to thermal motion . </S>",
    "<S> however , simulation has shown that at low temperature @xmath115mk and small @xmath116 parameters , rf heating is negligible zhang2007molecular , ryjkov2005simulations . </S>",
    "<S> heating effect due to rf phase shift and voltage fluctuation should also be negligible when they are well - controlled @xcite . + * discussion * + it is worthwhile to point out that although we have demonstrated the feasibility of our gate design via a single case with @xmath21 ions , the proposed scheme scales for larger crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the intuition is that through optimization of the segmented pulses , all phonon modes are nearly disentangled from the quantum qubits at the end of the gate . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the number of ions further increases , one would presumably need more and more precise control for all the experimental parameters ( @xmath117 fluctuation in voltage for example ) . </S>",
    "<S> rf heating may also destabilize a much larger crystal @xcite , and more careful studies are necessary for larger crystals .    </S>",
    "<S> one may also notice that in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , we considered gates mediated by the longitudinal phonon modes , so the effect of micromotion is a phase modulation . here , we utilize transverse modes so the amplitude of the laser beam is modulated . </S>",
    "<S> there are a few advantages in using the transverse modes : first , it is experimentally easier to access the transverse phonon modes in a planar ion crystal ; second , in a planar crystal , the transverse direction is tightly trapped , so micromotion along that direction can be neglected ; third , the transverse phonon modes do not couple to the in - plane modes and the in - plane micromotion affects the transverse modes via the time - dependence of the equilibrium positions , the effect of which is again suppressed due to tight trapping in the transverse direction .    in summary , we have demonstrated that a planar ion crystal in a quadrupole paul trap is a promising platform to realize scalable quantum computation when micromotion is taken into account explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the in - plane micromotion comes into play through three separate effects , and each of them can be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> this paves a new pathway for large - scale trapped - ion quantum computation .    </S>",
