    "von neumann s expansion problem was initially formulated to describe growth in production economies as an autocatalytic process and has played a key role in the development of the theory of economic growth @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "it concerns the calculation of the maximum growth rate achievable by an autocatalytic system of @xmath5 reactants ( labeled by greek indices like @xmath6 ) interconnected by @xmath7 chemical reactions ( labeled by roman indices like @xmath8 ) specified by a given stoichiometric matrix .",
    "the basic ingredients are however sufficiently simple to be applicable in different contexts ranging from economics to systems biology .    in order to state the optimization problem in mathematical terms ( see however @xcite for a more detailed description ) , it is convenient to separate the matrix of input stoichiometric coefficients @xmath9 ( input matrix for brevity ) from that of outputs @xmath10 .",
    "the relevant microscopic variables are the reaction fluxes , denoted by @xmath11 , which are assumed to be non - negative .",
    "the problem amounts to finding a vector @xmath12 of positive fluxes and a number @xmath13 such that @xmath14 is maximum subject to @xmath15 where the inequality is to be understood component - wise _ i.e. _ valid for each reactant @xmath16",
    ". the trivial null solution @xmath17 , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath18 , is not accepted : at least one component of @xmath19 must be strictly positive .    condition ( [ conda ] ) requires that the total output of every reactant is at least @xmath14 times the total input .",
    "so the maximum feasible @xmath14 , @xmath0 , measures the largest uniform growth rate achievable by the given set of reactions . if @xmath2 , the optimal state of the system is a contracting one .",
    "otherwise for @xmath3 it is expanding .",
    "the case @xmath20 describes instead a system in which at optimality reaction fluxes are arranged so as to guarantee mass balance .",
    "von neumann s problem has been studied recently in a statistical mechanics perspective under the assumptions that @xmath5 scales linearly with @xmath7 ( with @xmath21 ) and that the stoichiometric matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 have quenched random independent and identically distributed elements @xcite . with a fully connected network of reactions ( that is , one in which every reaction uses each reactant both as an input and as an output ) , one finds a transition from a contracting to an expanding regime when the parameter @xmath24 exceeds the critical value @xmath25 .    in this work",
    "we extend the analysis of @xcite to the finitely connected case where reactions use a finite number of inputs to produce a finite number of outputs . by analogy with integer programming problems ( see e.g. @xcite ) , we represent our autocatalytic network as a bipartite ( factor ) graph ( see fig .",
    "[ figuno ] ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    we denote reagents as squares and reactions as circles .",
    "each circle has a number of incoming ( resp .",
    "outgoing ) connections to squares , representing the inputs ( resp .",
    "outputs ) of the reaction , and each of these links carries the input ( resp .",
    "output ) stoichiometric coefficient .",
    "similarly , each square has a number of incoming ( resp .",
    "outgoing ) connections to circles , denoting the reactions where that reagent enters as an output ( resp .",
    "the notation @xmath26 identifies a reaction @xmath27 in which a reactant @xmath16 is involved either as an input or as an output ( and vice - versa for @xmath28 ) . to each reaction",
    "node a variable @xmath29 is attached , representing the flux of reaction @xmath27 .",
    "each reactant node @xmath16 carries instead a function @xmath30 given by @xmath31    we are interested in finding non - null flux configurations satisfying ( [ conda ] ) , that is such that @xmath32 for each @xmath16 and specifically in finding the largest value of @xmath14 for which a configuration of this type exists .",
    "our approach is developed along two main lines .",
    "on the one hand ( section 2 ) , we employ a suitably modified minover algorithm to compute optimal growth rates numerically on any graph .",
    "results thus derived will be theoretically validated in section 3 , where we use the cavity method to describe solutions analytically for locally tree - like instances .",
    "this approximation turns out to be in good qualitative agreement with numerical data .",
    "the connection of the latter approach with the fully connected theory developed in @xcite is presented in two detailed appendices .",
    "formula ( [ conda ] ) is reminiscent of pattern storage conditions in the perceptron , a formal neural network model @xcite .",
    "this analogy allowed us to devise an exact algorithm to solve von neumann s problem on any graph in a time growing only polynomially with the number @xmath7 of nodes .",
    "the algorithm is an extension of the so - called minover algorithm @xcite enforcing the constraint of positivity for the fluxes , and hereafter referred to as minover@xmath33 .",
    "the core part of the algorithm is a subroutine , minover@xmath34 , we now describe .",
    "we assume that the matrices @xmath35 are given , and @xmath14 denotes a real , non - negative number .    1 .",
    "step @xmath36 : all fluxes are null , @xmath37 .",
    "step @xmath38 : calculate the @xmath5 functions @xmath39 defined in ( [ func ] ) from the values @xmath40 of the fluxes at step @xmath41 , and look for the reactant with least value , @xmath42 if @xmath43 then output @xmath44 and halt ( the null solution is not accepted ) ; otherwise , if @xmath45 , update the fluxes according to the rule @xmath46 increase @xmath41 by one , and go to ( ii ) .",
    "in case of ties , one may select @xmath47 at random uniformly among those with the same ( and lowest ) values of @xmath30 .",
    "we claim that , if @xmath48 , the largest growth rate associated to matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 , minover@xmath49 will halt after a finite number of steps , and output a set of non - negative fluxes guaranteeing a growth rate larger than @xmath14 .",
    "the proof is simple and goes as follows .",
    "assume @xmath48 .",
    "then there exists a strictly positive number @xmath50 , hereafter called stability , and a vector @xmath51 of fluxes such that of fluxes fulfilling constraints ( [ conda ] ) is , by definition of @xmath52 , non empty .",
    "any vector @xmath53 in the interior of @xmath54 satisfies ( [ stab ] ) for some positive @xmath50 .",
    "a natural choice is the optimal vector of fluxes , _",

    "@xmath56 let @xmath57 and consider the functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we have , from ( [ update ] ) , @xmath60 from the non - negativity of @xmath61 and ( [ stab ] ) . we thus obtain @xmath62 for any step @xmath41 .",
    "turning to function @xmath63 we get @xmath64 from definition ( [ defaa ] ) and the assumption that the algorithm has not halted at step @xmath41 _ i.e. _ @xmath65 .",
    "hence @xmath66 .",
    "now let @xmath67 .",
    "but according to the above calculations @xmath68 therefore the algorithm halts after @xmath69 steps at most .",
    "now call @xmath70 the step at which the algorithm stops .",
    "the halting condition ensures that @xmath71 , _",
    "i.e. _ condition ( [ conda ] ) is satisfied , with a non - null vector of fluxes ( by construction the fluxes are non - negative at any step ) .",
    "hence @xmath72 is a solution to von neumann s problem with growth rate @xmath14 .",
    "our complete algorithm , minover@xmath33 , is an iteration of minover@xmath49 for increasing values of @xmath14 . starting from @xmath73 , a small positive value",
    "for which ( [ conda ] ) surely admits a solution , .",
    "] one can measure the convergence time ( number of steps prior to halting ) @xmath74 for increasing values of @xmath14 .",
    "the convergence time increases too .",
    "now we expect @xmath75 to vanish as @xmath76 when @xmath14 gets closer and closer to its optimal value , thus @xmath77 from ( [ lzero ] ) ( see fig . [ tempo ] ) .     for a _ single _ network with @xmath78 reagents and @xmath79 .",
    "the number of reagents per reaction is fixed at @xmath80 , the number of reactions per reagent is a poisson random variable with mean @xmath81 .",
    "the dashed line represents the best fit with @xmath82 . for this network , @xmath83.[tempo],width=302 ]",
    "one may then estimate the maximal growth rate by extrapolating from the log - log plot of the convergence time versus @xmath14 .      in what follows",
    "we restrict ourselves to purely autocatalytic systems , that is we assume that every reagent is produced and consumed by at least one reaction .",
    "indeed a reagent that only serves as input gives rise to a constraint of the form @xmath84 which is satisfied by taking @xmath85 .",
    "such a situation would immediately force the result @xmath86 , where @xmath5 is the number of reactants .",
    "this implies that such nodes are always present in the thermodynamic limit . in this work",
    "we discard them completely .",
    "however in practical applications ( e.g. metabolic networks",
    "@xcite ) it is important to take these nodes into account as prescribed `` sources '' ( uptakes ) . ] . on the other hand , `` sink '' reagents ( namely those that are not inputs of any reaction ) provide constraints that are @xmath14-independent and trivially satisfied .",
    "furthermore , for the sake of simplicity , we fix the number @xmath5 of reagents and assume that the quenched random stoichiometric matrix has gaussian elements with mean @xmath87 and variance @xmath88 .    for a start , we consider von neumann s problem on factor graphs in which every reaction has @xmath1 inputs and @xmath1 outputs , while for reagents we assume that the in(out)-degree distribution is poissonian , @xmath89 with mean degree @xmath90 . for short , we write regular@xmath91/poisson@xmath92 to denote this type of situation .",

    "the framework of von neumann s problem , including its global optimization aspect , is sufficiently simple to ensure that the methods developed in this work can be applied in several different contexts , particularly in economics and biology .",
