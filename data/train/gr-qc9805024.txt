    "this condition is obeyed by all known forms of classical matter , but is violated in quantum field theory  @xcite in which the renormalised energy density may become arbitrarily negative at points of spacetime . if extended regions of large negative energy density occur in nature , a variety of exotic phenomena might be possible , ranging from violations of the second law of thermodynamics and cosmic censorship to the creation of time machines and ` warp drive ' . accordingly",
    ", it is important to understand the extent to which the weak energy condition may be violated . in a series of papers  @xcite , ford ,",
    "roman and pfenning have studied quantum field theory in various flat and curved spacetimes and established lower bounds ( known as _ quantum inequalities _ ) on the time averaged energy densities measured by observers .",
    "the results have been employed to argue against the possibility of traversable wormholes  @xcite , warp drive  @xcite and also to discuss the rle of negative energy densities in the process of black hole evaporation  @xcite .    to be specific , consider a free real scalar field of mass @xmath9 in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski space , and let @xmath10 denote the renormalised stress - energy tensor .",
    "quantum inequalities provide lower bounds on the averaged expected energy density @xmath11 measured by a stationary observer at the spatial origin @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a non - negative sampling function and the angle brackets denote the expectation value in the quantum state @xmath14 .",

    "have shown  @xcite that in four dimensional minkowski space the averaged energy density @xmath18 obeys the bound @xmath19 for all ( sufficiently well - behaved ) states @xmath14 and any @xmath20 , where the real - valued function @xmath21 is independent of @xmath14 and is positive and strictly decreasing on @xmath22 with @xmath23 . in two dimensions",

    "however , our argument has the virtue of generalising directly to both massive field theory in two dimensions and to massive and massless field theory in four dimensional minkowski space .",

    "as we will see , this bound provides the key to our derivation of the quantum inequality  ( [ eq : qi ] ) .",
    "we conclude this section with two remarks .",
    "firstly , we have argued rather formally and have interchanged orders of integration at will .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that if @xmath13 has rapid decay at infinity ( e.g. , if @xmath13 is a schwartz test function ) our result can be established rigorously for a dense set of states in the folium of the usual minkowski vacuum , and conceivably for all hadamard states on the usual field algebra .",
    "secondly , we do not claim that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bd ] ) is the sharpest bound that can be placed on the expectation value of @xmath85 , and in fact do not expect that the bound is actually attained by any reasonable state @xmath14 , as @xmath14 would necessarily belong to the kernel of all @xmath86 s ( except , perhaps , for a set of measure zero ) .",
    "the result derived above allows a simple proof of the energy inequalities . with @xmath13 as in section  [",
    "sect : pos ] , define @xmath87 so that @xmath88 . by eq .",
    "( [ eq : t00 ] ) and the fact that @xmath60 is even , we have @xmath89 with @xmath78 and @xmath21 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fkk ] ) and  ( [ eq : gkk ] ) . clearly , @xmath90 is a finite sum of operators of the form @xmath85 .",
    "we therefore apply the bound  ( [ eq : bd ] ) for the various cases @xmath91 and add the results , obtaining @xmath92 for all ( sufficiently well - behaved ) states @xmath14 .",
    "here , @xmath33 is equal to the area of the unit @xmath34-sphere divided by @xmath35 [ with the convention that @xmath93 , that is , @xmath94",
    "if we now make the change of variables @xmath95 we find @xmath96 where the functions @xmath97 are defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : qn ] ) , thus completing the derivation of our general quantum inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) .",
    "we note that each @xmath97 is a positive function with @xmath40 and @xmath41 as @xmath42 . for @xmath98",
    ", @xmath97 is strictly increasing on @xmath22 , while @xmath99 exhibits a maximum near @xmath100 and decreases thereafter ",
    "see figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .    to conclude this section",
    ", we consider the scaling behaviour of  ( [ eq : qi ] ) .",
    "let @xmath101 be the scaled function @xmath102 this function has the same integral over @xmath61 as @xmath13 but with @xmath103 times the characteristic width .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath104 from which it follows that the bound for sampling function @xmath105 at mass @xmath9 is equal to @xmath106 times the bound for sampling function @xmath13 at mass @xmath107 .",
    "this is the expected scaling behaviour and is also exhibited by the quantum inequalities  ( [ eq : qifr4 ] ) and  ( [ eq : qifr2 ] ) of ford and roman .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that the value of the bound  ( [ eq : qi ] ) tends to zero for each fixed @xmath13 as @xmath108 .",
    "thus we have @xmath109 and we recover the averaged weak energy condition in the limit ( cf .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the most interesting cases of the general quantum inequality derived above , and compare our results with those of flanagan  @xcite and ford and roman  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , flanagan has derived an apparently optimal quantum inequality for massless 2-dimensional field theory  @xcite . substituting @xmath110 and @xmath111 into our bound eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) and using the fact that @xmath112 as @xmath42 , we find @xmath113 the integrand is an even function in @xmath114 , so we may extend the range of integration to the whole of @xmath61 and then employ parseval s theorem to yield a @xmath115-space version of the quantum inequality @xmath116 which should be compared with flanagan s bound  ( [ eq : qiflan ] ) .",
    "our bound is seen to be weaker by a factor of @xmath5 ; there is no contradiction because we do not expect our bound to be optimal .",
    "since flanagan s bound is six times stronger than that of ford and roman when applied to the lorentzian sampling function , our bound is accordingly four times stronger in this case .    in the 2-dimensional massive case , the quantum inequality  ( [ eq : qi ] ) becomes @xmath117 with @xmath43 given by @xmath118 figure  [ fig1 ] shows that @xmath99 exhibits a maximum value of approximately @xmath119 near @xmath100 .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that massive fields in @xmath3-dimensions can exhibit slightly stronger negative energy densities than massless fields can ( by a factor of at most @xmath119 ) .",
    "interestingly , a similar phenomenon occurs in ford and roman s treatment  @xcite so it would be worthwhile to determine whether this is indeed so , or whether the peak is an artifact of the argument ( as ford and roman suggest ) .      just as in the 2-dimensional case discussed above , the 4-dimensional quantum inequality takes a particularly simple form for massless fields : @xmath120 in particular , for the lorentzian function we have @xmath121 which is @xmath122 of ford and roman s result  ( [ eq : qifr4 ] ) in this case [ recall that @xmath23 ] .",
    "this entails a slight tightening of the constraints on traversable wormholes  @xcite .    finally , we state the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) in the 4-dimensional massive case . in terms of the fourier transform of @xmath13",
    ", we have @xmath124 where @xmath125 as figure  [ fig2 ] makes clear , the function @xmath44 is bounded between zero and unity .",
    "accordingly the bound  ( [ eq : qi4massless ] ) is also a lower bound for massive fields : in 4 dimensions [ indeed , in any spacetime dimension greater than or equal to three ] the effect of introducing a mass can not decrease the averaged energy density below the massless bound .",
    "we have given a simple derivation of a quantum inequality for the free real scalar field in minkowski space of any dimension , which allows more general sampling functions than previously possible .",
    "in particular , our derivation allows for compactly supported sampling functions and therefore removes any remaining doubt that the quantum inequalities of ford and roman might rely on subtle large scale effects to cancel local negative energy densities . in conclusion , we make various remarks .    first",
    ", the derivation given here has been somewhat formal and lacking in mathematical rigour . however , we hope that our argument is simple enough that a rigorous formulation might be established without too much difficulty , and intend to return to this issue elsewhere .",
    "two elements of our discussion need to be more precisely specified : namely the class of sampling functions and the class of quantum states for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) is valid .",
    "we have required that the sampling function @xmath13 be even primarily for convenience , and expect that this condition may be removed .",
    "in addition , we may speculate as to whether it is necessary that @xmath13 be smooth . of course , a necessary condition on @xmath13 is is that the integral on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) should converge ; this amounts to a smoothness condition on @xmath13 which becomes more stringent as the spacetime dimension increases ( and which is always satisfied if @xmath13 is actually smooth ) .",
    "thus , it may be that the smoothness of @xmath13 could be relaxed to @xmath126 where @xmath127 depends on @xmath128 .",
    "however , it is clearly important that @xmath13 has some degree of continuity . as an example , suppose @xmath13 is the characteristic function for the interval @xmath129\\subset{{\\bbb r}}$ ] .",
    "we have @xmath130 from which it follows that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) diverges for any @xmath37 .",
    "thus the quantum inequality provides no information in this case , which is consistent with results of garfinkle ( quoted by yurtsever in  @xcite  see particularly footnote  [ 1 ] therein ) that the integral of @xmath131 over sharply defined boxes in spacetime can be unboundedly negative . as mentioned above , the class of quantum states for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : qi ] ) holds must also be clarified .",
    "it is likely that quantum inequalities will hold for a dense class of states in the fock space built on the minkowski vacuum ; more generally , we hope that such inequalities might be established for the class of ( globally ) hadamard states  @xcite .",
    "second , we have seen that our bound is weaker by a factor of @xmath5 than the optimal bound proposed by flanagan  @xcite , which was derived using special features of 2-dimensional massless field theory .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether our argument could be improved to replicate flanagan s result and perhaps to obtain optimal bounds for the massive case and also higher dimensional spacetimes ."
