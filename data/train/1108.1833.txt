    "diffusive acceleration by supernova shock waves can accelerate particles to very high energies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gamma - ray observations are a useful probe of these mechanisms complementary to other wavebands .",
    "so far , observations by the large area telescope  ( lat ) on board the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ have demonstrated that bright gamma - ray sources coincident with middle - aged supernova remnants  ( snrs ) interacting with dense molecular clouds  @xcite exhibit steep gamma - ray spectra above a few gev .",
    "a possible conventional explanation for these spectral properties is that the energy distribution of cosmic rays ( cr ) is greatly influenced by their diffusive transport  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , these features can also be explained by reacceleration of pre - existing cosmic rays at a cloud shock and subsequent adiabatic compression where strong ion - neutral collisions accompanying alf@xmath7en wave evanescence lead to a steepening of the spectrum of accelerated particles  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , using three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations , @xcite show that the interaction between a supernova blast wave and inhomogeneous interstellar clouds formed by thermal instability generates multiple reflected shocks , which can further energize cosmic - ray particles originally accelerated at the blast - wave shock and produce the spectral break . since the gamma - ray bright regions are expected to be different in the aforementioned models , studying snrs with large apparent sizes can help to disentangle the origin of the spectral features .",
    "the cygnus loop  ( g74.0@xmath08.5 ) is one of the most famous and well - studied middle - aged snrs .",
    "the size  ( @xmath1  3@xmath4 ) makes it an ideal candidate for detailed morphological studies in high - energy gamma rays since it is larger than the lat angular resolution above a few hundred mev .",
    "the large angular offset from the galactic plane  ( @xmath8 ) reduces the problems of background contamination and permits a detailed study of the environment around the shock region by means of infrared / optical / uv observations .",
    "the shell - like x - ray emission from thermal plasma is prominent in the northern region of the remnant , with a blowout in the southern rim  @xcite .",
    "the radio spectrum from the limb - brightened shells is non - thermal  @xcite .",

    "four lat sources positionally associated with the cygnus loop snr are listed in the 1fgl catalog  @xcite . in this paper , we report a detailed analysis of _ fermi _ lat observations in the cygnus loop region .",
    "first , we briefly describe the observations and data selection in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the analysis procedure and the results are presented in section  [ sec : ana ] , with the study of the morphology and spectrum of emission associated with the cygnus loop .",

    "details about the lat instrument and pre - launch expectations for the performance can be found in @xcite . compared to earlier high - energy gamma - ray telescopes ,",
    "the lat has a larger field of view  ( @xmath1  2.4  sr ) , a larger effective area  ( @xmath1  8000  @xmath13 for @xmath121  gev on - axis ) and improved point - spread function  ( psf ; the 68% containment angle @xmath14  gev is smaller than 1@xmath4 ) .",
    "routine science operations with the lat began on august 4 , 2008 .",
    "we have analyzed events in the region of the cygnus loop collected from august 4 , 2008 , to august 1 , 2010 , with a total exposure of @xmath1  6  @xmath15  10@xmath16  @xmath13  s  ( at 1  gev ) .",
    "the lat was operated in sky - survey mode for almost the entire period . in this observing mode",
    "the lat scans the whole sky , obtaining complete sky coverage every 2 orbits  ( @xmath1  3  hr ) and approximately uniform exposure .",
    "we used the standard lat analysis software , the _ sciencetools _ version v9r16 , publicly available from the _ fermi _ science support center ( fssc ) , and applied the following event selection criteria : 1 ) events have the highest probability of being gamma rays , i.e. , they are classified in the so - called pass 6 _ diffuse _ class @xcite , 2 ) events have a reconstructed zenith angle less than 105@xmath4 , to minimize the contamination from earth - limb gamma - ray emission , and 3 ) only time intervals when the center of the lat field of view is within 52@xmath4 of the local zenith are accepted to further reduce the contamination by earth s atmospheric emission .",
    "we also eliminated two short periods of time during which the lat detected the bright gev - emitting grb  081024b  @xcite and grb  100116a  @xcite within 15@xmath4 of the cygnus loop .",
    "we restricted the analysis to the energy range @xmath17  mev to avoid possible large systematics due to the rapidly varying effective area and much broader psf at lower energies .",
    "in order to study the morphology of gamma - ray emission associated with the cygnus loop we performed a binned likelihood analysis based on poisson statistics(see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we used only events above 0.5  gev  ( compared to the 0.2  gev used in the spectral analysis ) for the morphological study to take advantage of the narrower psf at higher energies . for this work we used the instrument response functions  ( irfs ) ` p6_v3 ` , which were developed following the launch to address gamma - ray detection inefficiencies that are correlated with background rates  @xcite .",
    "the analysis was performed over a square region of 12@xmath1812@xmath4 width with a pixel size of 0.@xmath41 .",

    "figure  [ fig : raw_cmap ]  ( a ) shows a count map in the 0.510  gev energy band in the region used for the analysis , as well as the position of the cygnus loop from radio measurements and point sources in the 1fgl catalog .",
    "the four lat sources , 1fgl  j2046.4@xmath263041 , 1fgl  j2049.1@xmath263142 , 1fgl  j2055.2@xmath263144 and 1fgl  j2057.4@xmath263057 , are associated with the cygnus loop .",
    "note that no gamma - ray pulsation was found for any of these lat sources .",
    "although the cygnus loop is at intermediate galactic latitude , the contribution of the galactic interstellar emission in the gamma - ray band is still important ; it must be carefully modeled to perform morphological studies .",
    "some of the interstellar gas tracers in the standard diffuse model provided by the lat collaboration are not fully adequate for the cygnus region , notably the e(b - v ) map  @xcite because of infrared source contamination and temperature correction problems in such a massive - star forming region .",
    "we therefore constructed a dedicated diffuse emission model .",
    "the model is analogous to the standard lat diffuse model and it includes : a )  an isotropic background , taking into account the isotropic diffuse gamma - ray emission as well as residual misclassified cr interactions in the lat ; b )  large - scale galactic inverse compton emission produced by cr electrons and positrons upscattering low - energy photons , modeled using the galprop code ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; c ) emission from interstellar gas arising from nucleon - nucleon interactions and electron bremsstrahlung , which is modeled through spatial templates accounting for atomic gas and co - bright molecular gas , partitioned along the line of sight to separate the cygnus complex from the segments of the spiral arms in the outer galaxy seen in this direction , as well as dark gas traced by visual extinction . with respect to the standard diffuse model ,",
    "this one includes higher - resolution h@xmath27  data @xcite , visual extinction as a dark - gas tracer @xcite and it is specifically tuned to reproduce lat data in the cygnus region , including the region of the cygnus loop .",
    "all these components , along with individual sources , were jointly fitted to the lat data in 10 energy bands over the range 0.1100 gev with a free normalization in each energy bin ( except for the inverse compton model that was kept fixed ) . for further details",
    "we refer the reader to the dedicated paper @xcite , where the model is also discussed in detail in terms of cr and interstellar medium properties .",
    "we note that the presence of the cygnus loop was taken into account in this study .",
    "several models were considered for the loop , a combination of point sources and geometric templates such as a disk and a ring , as in the analysis performed in this paper . in this way we verified that the impact of the emission from the cygnus loop on the parameters of the global model of the region is small @xcite .",
    "the results of this analysis were used to construct two model cubes , as a function of direction and energy , separately accounting for the isotropic and smooth large - scale galactic inverse - compton emission ( a and  b ) and the structured emission from the gas ( c ) .",
    "such model cubes are part of the background model used to study the cygnus loop in this paper . for each of them we included a free normalization in order to further allow the model to adapt in the different cases we investigated along the paper .",
    "in addition to interstellar emission , the background model to study the cygnus loop includes individual point - like sources in the 1fgl catalog within 15@xmath4 of the cygnus loop except for the sources associated with the cygnus loop itself in the catalog ; their positions were kept fixed at those given in the catalog and the spectra of the two gamma - ray pulsars in the region used for the analysis were modeled as power laws with exponential cutoffs leaving all spectral parameters free , while the spectra of the other sources were modeled as power laws leaving the integral fluxes as free parameters and assuming the spectral indices reported in the catalog .",
    "note that , due to the psf , which is poor compared to other wavelengths and strongly energy dependent , and the presence of a bright and structured background given by the interstellar emission , it is difficult to mask the background sources , and they are instead modeled along with the cygnus loop . the resulting model of background emission  ( i.e. not including emission associated with the cygnus loop ) is shown in figure  [ fig : raw_cmap ]  ( b ) .",
    "the pulsars j2043@xmath262740 and j2055@xmath2625 are the most important point sources in the vicinity , but the amount of events from those sources that fall within the cygnus loop  ( due to the broad low - energy psf ) is only 0.4  % and 0.2  % of the estimated emission from the loop , respectively .",

    "the correlation between gamma rays , x - rays and h@xmath6  emission is evident .",
    "there is correlation among gamma rays and radio continuum emission in the northern part of the cygnus loop . on the other hand ,",
    "the southern rim is brighter in radio continuum emission than in gamma rays , a phenomenon that perhaps might be explained by the existence of another snr overlapping with the southern part of the cygnus loop  @xcite .",
    "the co line intensities were integrated for velocities with respect to the local standard of rest @xmath30  km  s@xmath3  @xmath31 km  s@xmath3  0  km  s@xmath3 . ] .",
    "no obvious association with co emission is found ; some molecular material is apparently located on the western side of the cygnus loop , but the relationship is not clear .",
    "on the other hand , some correlation with thermal emission from dust at 100  @xmath29 m , which can be considered as a proxy of total interstellar matter densities , is possible .    to quantitatively evaluate the correlation with emission at other wavebands , we fitted the lat counts with the different models for the cygnus loop on top of the background model described above .",
    "first the cygnus loop was modeled with the four 1fgl sources , and then using the images at other wavelengths as spatial templates assuming a simple power - law spectrum .",
    "note that we did not use the co and infrared images as spatial templates due to clear differences between them and the gamma - ray image as shown in figure  [ fig : subtract_cmap ] .",
    "the resulting maximum likelihood values with respect to the maximum likelihood for the null hypothesis ( no emission associated with the cygnus loop ) are summarized in table  [ tab : likeratio ] .",
    "the test statistic  ( ts ) values , i.e. @xmath32  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for the x - ray and h@xmath6  images are significantly larger than for the four 1fgl sources .",
    "on the other hand , the ts for the radio image increases moderately in spite of the association in the northern rim , confirming that radio continuum structures in the southern rim do not well correlate with gamma - ray emission .",
    "we further characterized the morphology of gamma - ray emission associated with the loop by using simple parametrized geometrical models .",
    "we started with a uniform disk / ring assuming a simple power - law spectrum .",
    "we varied the radius and location of the disk and evaluated the maximum likelihood values . in the case of the ring , we varied inner and outer radii as well .",
    "the resulting ts values are reported in table  [ tab : likeratio ] .",
    "the ts value for the ring with respect to the disk shape is @xmath33  12 .",
    "assuming that , in the null hypothesis , the ts value is distributed as a @xmath34 with @xmath35 degrees of freedom , where @xmath35 is the difference in degrees of freedom between the two nested models compared ( @xmath36 in the present case ) , it would be equivalent to an improvement at @xmath37 confidence level .",
    "let us note , however , that the conversion of ts values into confidence level  ( or , equivalently , false positive rate ) is subject to numerous caveats , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we will thus take into account the source morphology uncertainties in the spectral analysis , below . in order to further illustrate the morphology of the gamma - ray emission , in figure  [ fig : radialprofile ] we show its radial profile compared with the best - fit disk / ring models .",
    "finally , we want to verify if there are any spectral variations in the gamma - ray emission associated with the cygnus loop we are modeling as a whole .",
    "we thus divided the best - fit ring into four regions as shown in figure  [ fig : rim_definition ] and allowed an independent normalization and spectral index for the four portions of the ring .",
    "there was no significant improvement of the likelihood for such a non - uniform ring .",
    "the ts value and power - law spectral index for each of the four regions of the remnant are reported for reference in table  [ tab : spatial_difference ] .",
    "no significant differences are found between the four spectral indexes .",
    "therefore we adopted the uniform ring template with maximum likelihood parameters for the whole snr in the following spectral analysis .      to measure the spectrum we made maximum likelihood fits in 8 logarithmically - spaced energy bands from 0.2  gev to 100  gev , using the ring template as the model for the spatial distribution of the cygnus loop .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows the resulting spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "upper limits at the 90  % confidence level are calculated assuming a photon index of 2 if the detection is not significant in an energy bin , i.e. , the ts value with respect to the null hypothesis is less than 10  ( corresponding to 3.2  @xmath38 for one additional degree of freedom ) .",
    "note that the value of the spectral index has a negligible effect on the upper limits .",
    "we identify at least three different sources of systematic uncertainties affecting the estimate of the fluxes : uncertainties in the lat event selection efficiency , the morphological template and the diffuse model adopted for analysis .",
    "uncertainties in the lat effective area are estimated to be 10  % at 100  mev , decreasing to 5  % at 500  mev , and increasing to 20  % at 10  gev and above  @xcite . evaluating the systematic uncertainties due to",
    "the modeling of interstellar emission is a challenging task , because interstellar emission is highly structured and methods used at other wavelengths , like comparisons with neighboring regions , are not fully adequate in the gev band .",
    "we therefore roughly gauged the related uncertainties by comparing the results with those obtained by adopting instead the standard lat diffuse background models .",
    "we similarly gauged the uncertainties due to the morphological template by comparing the results with those obtained by using the best - fit disk template instead of the ring .",
    "the total systematic errors are set by adding the above uncertainties in quadrature .",
    "systematic uncertainties are driven by the imperfect knowledge of the background emission and , especially below a few hundred mev , of the lat response . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec ] we show the uncertainties obtained following these prescriptions .",
    "we probed for a spectral break in the lat energy band by comparing the likelihood values of a spectral fit over the whole energy range considered based on a simple power law and other spectral functions .",
    "note that no systematic uncertainties are accounted for in the likelihood fitting process .",
    "the ts values and best - fit parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : spectral_shape ] .",
    "the fit with a log - parabola function yields a ts value of @xmath39 compared to a simple power - law model , which corresponds to an improvement at the @xmath40  @xmath38 confidence level . in spite of the uncertainties discussed above in the estimate of the confidence level , the large ts value is indicative of a significant improvement in the fit .",
    "a smoothly broken power law provides a very slight increase in the likelihood with respect to the log - parabola function , while a power law with exponential cutoff gives a worse fit . in conclusion ,",
    "a simple power law as spectral model can be significantly rejected and from all the different models with cutoffs we get evidence for a steepening of the spectrum above 23  gev .",
    "we detect gamma - ray emission with a formal significance of 23  @xmath38 for the above curved spectral shapes .",
    "the observed photon flux and energy flux in the 0.2100  gev range are @xmath41  @xmath42  s@xmath3 and @xmath43  erg  @xmath42  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosity inferred from our analysis is @xmath1  @xmath44erg  s@xmath3 between 1100  gev , lower by one order of magnitude than observed for other gev - emitting snrs  ( typically @xmath45  erg  s@xmath3 , * ? ? ?",

    "this makes the cygnus loop the largest gamma - ray emitting snr observed so far , allowing us to perform a detailed morphological comparison with emission at other wavelengths .",
    "there is a correspondence among gamma - ray emission , x - ray rims and h@xmath6  filaments , indicating that the high - energy particles responsible for gamma - ray emission are in the vicinity of the shock regions .",
    "the balmer - dominated filaments define the current location of the blast wave and mark the presence of neutral material",
    ". detailed studies of the particular locations at the northeast have used these nonradiative shocks as density probes  @xcite and derived post - shock densities of @xmath1  5  @xmath46 where gamma - ray emission is expected to be bright due to the compressed material and high density of accelerated particles .",
    "the radio continuum emission , originated by high - energy electrons via synchrotron radiation , is well correlated with gamma - ray emission in the northern region of the remnant but not in the southern one the presence of a second snr was suggested by @xcite .",
    "the two snrs would be at about the same distance based on the rotation measure analysis of the radio data  @xcite .",
    "the lack of correlation between gamma rays and radio continuum emission in the southern region plausibly implies that the second snr is not producing significant gamma - ray emission at our current sensitivity .",
    "there might be some correlation between total matter densities as traced by infrared thermal emission from dust and gamma - ray emission , whereas co emission does not obviously overlap with the cygnus loop . from these considerations , we argue that the bulk of gamma - ray emission comes from interactions of high - energy particles accelerated at the shocks of the cygnus loop with interstellar matter or fields in the regions just adjacent to the shocks with a gas density of @xmath1  5  cm  @xmath47 .    to model the broadband emission from the entire snr we adopt the simplest possible assumption that gamma rays are emitted by a population of accelerated protons and electrons distributed in the same region and characterized by constant matter density and magnetic field strength .",
    "we assume the injected electrons to have the same momentum distribution as protons .",
    "this assumption requires a break in the momentum spectrum because the spectral index in the radio domain , corresponding to lower particle momenta , is much harder than for gamma rays , which correspond to higher particle momenta .",
    "therefore , we use the following functional form to model the momentum distribution of injected particles : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the break momentum , @xmath50 is the spectral index below the break and @xmath51 above the break .",
    "note that here we consider minimum momenta of 100  mev  @xmath52 since the details of the proton / electron injection process are poorly known .",
    "electrons suffer energy losses due to ionization , coulomb scattering , bremsstrahlung , synchrotron emission and inverse compton  ( ic ) scattering .",
    "we calculated the evolution of the electron momenta spectrum by the following equation : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the momentum loss rate , and @xmath55 is the particle injection rate .",
    "we assume @xmath55 to be constant , i.e. , that the shock produces a constant number of particles until the snr enters the radiative phase , at which time the source turns off .",
    "this prescription approximates the weakening of the shock and the reduction in the particle acceleration efficiency , which would be properly treated by using a time - dependent shock compression ratio  @xcite . to derive the remnant emission spectrum we calculated @xmath56 numerically , where @xmath57 is the snr age of @xmath10  yr .",
    "note that we neglected the momentum losses for protons since the timescale of neutral pion production is @xmath1  10@xmath58  yr where @xmath59 is the gas density averaged over the entire snr shell and is much longer than the snr age . also we do not consider the gamma - ray emission by secondary positrons and electrons from charged pion decay , because the emission from secondaries is generally unimportant relative to that from primary electrons unless the gas density is as high as that in dense molecular clouds and the snr evolution reaches the later stages , or the injected electron - to - proton ratio is much lower than locally observed .",

    "since their spectra are very complex , they are approximated by two infrared and two optical blackbody components .",

    "increasing the intensity of the interstellar radiation field would loosen the constraint on the gas density .",
    "however , a radiation field about 50 times more intense is required to satisfy the above assumption on the gas density .    to summarize , it is most natural to assume that gamma - ray emission from the cygnus loop is dominated by decay of @xmath60 produced in nucleon - nucleon interactions of hadronic cosmic rays with interstellar matter .",
    "it should be emphasized that our observations of the cygnus loop combined with the radio data constrain the proton momentum break to be in the range , 110  gev  @xmath52 , despite the lack of association with dense molecular clouds unlike the other middle - aged snrs detected with the lat .",
    "thus in this case cosmic rays responsible for gamma - ray emission are localized near their acceleration sites without significant diffusion taking place . the correspondence observed between gamma rays and h@xmath6  emission",
    "may be accounted for in the `` crushed cloud '' scenario by @xcite , although the expected filaments can not be resolved by current gamma - ray telescopes .",

    "however , the scenario of acceleration by reflected shocks might be operative , on consideration of x - ray and optical observations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "0 since the cygnus loop is not distant from the earth , a characteristic feature in the spectrum of the electrons in 12  tev might be detected in the vicinity of the earth  @xcite . from lat measurements of gamma rays we derived a total energy for in - situ electrons of @xmath1  4.9  @xmath15  10@xmath72  erg in the @xmath60-decay model .",
