    "in the past few years , the role of spatial discreteness in lattice systems described by differential - difference equations has been increasingly recognized @xcite . in these settings ,",
    "the spatial variables are discrete , while the evolution variable is continuum .",
    "relevant applications are continuously arising in rather diverse physical contexts such as the spatial dynamics of optical beams in coupled waveguide arrays in nonlinear optics @xcite , the temporal evolution of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices in soft - condensed matter physics @xcite , the dna double strand in biophysics @xcite , and so on .    in the examples that stem from physical applications ,",
    "the form of the discrete model is dictated by the underlying physics , and typically that form is the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xcite .",
    "however , there are also exceptions to this rule , where the nature of the nonlinearity @xcite or of the dispersion @xcite or both @xcite imposes variations of this ubiquitous model .",
    "another motivation to study such modified dnls models is a more mathematical one , namely the aim of identifying models with good mathematical properties ( e.g. exact solutions , additional symmetries or , possibly , complete integrability ) .",
    "such a program was initiated by the derivation of an integrable analog of the dnls equation , namely the so - called ablowitz - ladik model @xcite .",
    "this was later used for computational studies of the nls equation @xcite , as well as implemented as a good starting point for developing perturbation theoretic approaches to the dnls limit , in order to examine the existence and stability of its solutions @xcite .",
    "we should note here that a similar , mathematically - minded program of discretizations has been evolving for klein - gordon ( kg ) type lattices .",
    "for instance , integrable discretizations of equations such as the sine - gordon model have been obtained @xcite ; there have also been attempts to systematically discretize preserving symmetries of the underlying continuum model , such as , especially , a discrete analog of translational invariance .",
    "it has often been noted that `` standard '' ( e.g. centered - difference schemes for laplacian type operators ) discretizations strongly violate translational invariance , leading stable and unstable steady states ( typically centered on - site and inter - site between two lattice nodes ) .",
    "this not only imposes undesirable mathematical properties @xcite , but also modifies the underlying phenomenology in comparison to the continuum model @xcite .",
    "in that view , discretizations that preserve an effective translational invariance by allowing the center of a stationary state to be a free parameter ( rather than to be fixed on- or half - way between two lattice sites ) have been sought . in this way",
    ", such discretizations also avoid `` energy barriers '' ( so called peierls - nabarro barriers ) between on - site and inter - site states .",
    "such discrete models have been constructed in the kg case , based on a discretization of the energy , using the bogomolnyi approach @xcite , as well as a discretization of the equation of motion ensuring the persistence of a discrete momentum conservation law @xcite .",
    "these classes of models were subsequently tested for the potential bearing of travelling wave solutions , using the technology based on the calculation of the stokes constant @xcite ; this led to the conjecture that such models may possess isolated , exact , travelling lattice solutions .",
    "it is , finally , worthwhile to note that while motivated by their mathematical properties , such models may also bear physical relevance as is indicated e.g. in the very recent preprint of @xcite for the sine - gordon case .",
    "while this technology has been well developed for the single ( i.e. , scalar ) field case of kg lattices , such considerations do not seem to have been applied to nls type lattices , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the present manuscript aims to partially fill this gap , by presenting a systematic methodology for deriving discretizations of polynomial nonlinearity partial differential equations ( pdes ) of the nls type .",
    "the main novel feature of these discrete models is that , contrary to what is the case for the standard dnls equation , they preserve a discrete analog of the momentum conservation law .",
    "in fact , we show that in the cubic case , they are natural homotopic generalizations of the integrable nls discretization of @xcite .    our presentation will be structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the general setup of the continuum and discrete models of the present work . in section iii , we illustrate the auxiliary problem that aids us to construct the desired discretizations in section iv . in section",
    "v , we study some of the conservation laws of the obtained models , while in section vi , we discuss their solitonic properties .",
    "finally , in section vii , we briefly summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "we present our methodology for the generalized nls equation of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex function of two real variables ; @xmath2 is a real function of its argument and @xmath3 .",
    "we introduce the lattice @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the lattice spacing and @xmath6 we also introduce the following shorthand notations @xmath7 and will focus only on discretizations that involve such nearest neighbor sites",

    "such a selection will entail a mono - parametric freedom for the resulting algebraic problem leading to stationary state solutions .",
    "this will , in turn , be responsible for the effective translational invariance in what follows .",
    "firstly , we formulate an auxiliary problem . seeking stationary solutions of eq .",

    "we now try to connect the above presented construction to the relevant conservation laws of the resulting infinite - dimensional dynamical system .",
