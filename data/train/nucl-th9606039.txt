    "lattice calculations of the thermodynamical functions of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) indicate @xcite that , ( at zero net baryon density ) in the vicinity of a critical temperature @xmath4 mev , strongly interacting matter undergoes a rapid transition from a ( chirally broken , confined ) hadronic phase to a ( chirally symmetric , deconfined ) quark  gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the width of that transition region is presently only known to be in the range @xmath5 mev .",
    "therefore , one can not yet conclude whether the transition is a first order phase transition ( @xmath6 ) , or merely a rapid increase of the entropy density associated with the change from @xmath7 hadronic to @xmath8 quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the primary goals of relativistic heavy - ion physics is the creation and experimental observation of the predicted qgp phase of matter .",
    "many signatures have been proposed such as electromagnetic radiation of thermal dileptons and photons @xcite , @xmath9suppression @xcite , jet quenching @xcite , strangelet formation @xcite , or disordered chiral condensates ( dcc s ) @xcite .",
    "these signatures , however , do not depend directly on the actual form of the nuclear matter equation of state .",
    "thermal electromagnetic radiation is , for instance , generic to any hot system , independent from its degrees of freedom ( as long as they have electromagnetic charge ) .",
    "for example , it was shown @xcite that a hot hadron gas shines as brightly as a qgp . similarly , jet quenching and @xmath9suppression  suppression as a function of transverse energy in pb+pb  collisions at 158 agev @xcite . ]",
    "are generic consequences of final state interactions in any form of dense matter @xcite .",
    "finally , strangelet or dcc formation require very specific assumptions about the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study signals that are more directly related to the qcd equation of state .",
    "signals of this type emerge from the influence of the equation of state on the _ collective _ dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "such signals must be calculated within the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite , since that is the only dynamical model which provides a _ direct _ link between collective observables and the equation of state .",
    "of course , the use of such an approach requires a strong dynamical assumption , namely that the equilibration rates are much larger than typical gradients of thermodynamic quantities in the system .",
    "it now appears that radiative gluon energy loss in a qgp may be sufficiently large @xcite to support local equilibration on time scales less than 1 fm / c . in the following , we therefore neglect dissipative effects and assume the validity of ideal hydrodynamics to compute the collective evolution of the system .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the transition to the qgp softens the equation of state in the transition region , and thus reduces the tendency of matter to expand on account of its internal pressure .",
    "this , in turn , delays the expansion and considerably prolongs the lifetime of the system .",
    "in @xcite it was moreover shown that this effect leads to a reduction of the transverse directed flow in semi - peripheral collisions that can be readily tested experimentally at fixed target energies @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the flow structure for the one  dimensional expansion of a slab of matter ( `` landau expansion model '' @xcite ) was studied as a function of its initial energy density @xmath10 and of the width @xmath2 of the transition region in the equation of state . in particular ,",
    "it was shown how , in addition to the softening of the equation of state , for @xmath11 the type of the hydrodynamical expansion solution changes qualitatively from a simple rarefaction wave to a rarefaction discontinuity .",
    "such deflagration fronts @xcite have small velocities , @xmath12 , and thus the conversion of qgp matter into hadronic matter is considerably delayed .",
    "in @xcite we also showed that for larger transition widths ( @xmath13 ) the lifetime of matter with temperature around @xmath14 is considerably reduced but cooler regions with @xmath15 remain long - lived .    in the present work",
    "we extend the investigations of @xcite to more realistic , 3dimensional geometries .",
    "we consider systems with spherical symmetry ( `` fireball '' geometry ) , and with transverse cylindrical symmetry and boost - invariant initial conditions in longitudinal direction ( `` bjorken cylinder '' geometry @xcite ) .",
    "for these symmetric geometries it is possible to use a modified one  dimensional algorithm as e.g.   presented in @xcite .",
    "note that in contrast to the simple one  dimensional landau geometry , single inclusive particle spectra and also two  particle correlation functions can be calculated in a realistic way from the hydrodynamic solutions for the above geometries .    in this paper",
    "we show that the influence of the width @xmath2 of the transition on the dynamical evolution of the system in these 3dimensional geometries is very similar to that found in @xcite for purely one  dimensional expansion .",
    "in particular , the softening of the equation of state associated with a rapid cross - over region leads to a delay in the expansion and a prolonged lifetime of matter with temperature _ below _ @xmath14 .    to explore observable consequences of the prolonged lifetime of the system",
    ", we then calculate the inverse width of the two  particle correlation functions in side and out  direction , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we demonstrate that the initial energy density dependence of the system s lifetime is mapped closely by the excitation function of the ratio @xmath18 .",
    "the phase transition leads to a time - delayed expansion that is reflected in an enhancement of the above ratio relative to its value obtained in the ideal gas case without a transition .",
    "this signature of the qgp transition was first proposed by pratt @xcite who performed similar calculations for the fireball geometry and , independently , by bertsch et al .",
    "@xcite who employed a kinetic model for the hadronization in the bjorken cylinder geometry .",
    "these previous investigations assumed the existence of a sharp first order transition , @xmath6 .",
    "we show here that this signature is a generic feature of a rapid cross - over transition and holds for @xmath19 as well .",
    "the importance of the time delay as a signature of qgp formation is that it is among the few signatures that probe directly the equation of state of strongly interacting matter .",
    "it tests whether there exists a `` soft region '' in the equation of state of ultra - dense matter @xcite which is most naturally characterized @xcite by a reduction of the local velocity of sound @xmath20 as a function of the local energy density . as discussed in detail in the next section ,",
    "a very general feature of a transition ( that happens within a sufficiently narrow temperature interval @xmath2 ) is the existence of such a region . for matter passing through that region of energy densities during the expansion phase ,",
    "the flow will temporarily slow down or even possibly stall under suitable conditions .",
    "the main result of the present work is to identify initial conditions where the resulting stall is sufficiently long to be observable via pion interferometry @xcite . as we show , the maximum time delay may occur at ags as well as at rhic energies , depending on whether matter is initially stopped in a fireball or expands as in bjorken s longitudinally boost - invariant scenario .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the equation of state used in our investigations and explain our method to solve the hydrodynamical equations numerically for the above mentioned geometries . in section 3",
    "we compare the hydrodynamical expansion solutions for different initial energy densities , for different values of @xmath2 , and for different values of degrees of freedom in the qgp and hadronic phase .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the discussion of the lifetime of the system and how it can be measured via the widths of the side and out  correlation function .",
    "section 5 concludes with a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "two appendices contain the derivation of the formulae employed to calculate the two  particle correlation functions in the hydrodynamical framework .",
    "natural units @xmath21 are used throughout this paper .",
    "available lattice data for the entropy density in full qcd can be approximated by the simple parametrization @xcite @xmath22 ^ 3   \\left ( 1 + \\frac{d_q - d_h}{d_q+d_h } \\ ,   \\tanh \\left [ \\frac{t - t_c}{\\delta t } \\right ] \\right)~,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the entropy density at @xmath14 .",

    "this ratio determines the latent heat ( density ) @xmath30 .",

    "would then correspond to about @xmath39 mev @xmath36 in physical units . to cover the range of uncertainty in the qcd equation of state we consider @xmath40 and @xmath37 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 in our investigation of hydrodynamical expansion solutions .    in fig .  1 we show ( a ) the entropy density and ( b ) the energy density as functions of temperature , and ( c ) the pressure and ( d ) the velocity of sound squared @xmath43 as functions of energy density for @xmath6 , @xmath42 , and an ideal gas with @xmath7 degrees of freedom for @xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding plot for @xmath37 looks rather similar qualitatively and is not shown .",
    "quantitative differences are : ( i ) the phase boundaries are different , @xmath44 shifts from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , @xmath47 from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , and @xmath50 from @xmath51 to @xmath52 . also , as mentioned above , ( ii ) the latent heat @xmath53 is reduced .",

    "it is therefore the velocity of sound , fig .  1 ( d )",

    "it represents the capability to perform mechanical work ( which is proportional to pressure gradients @xmath57 ) for a given gradient in energy density @xmath58 . for @xmath29 , the velocity of sound vanishes in the mixed phase ,",
    "i.e. , mixed phase matter does not expand at all on its own account , even if there are strong gradients in the energy density .",
    "this has the consequence that it does not perform mechanical work and therefore cools less rapidly . for finite @xmath2 ,",
    "pressure gradients are finite , but still smaller than for an ideal gas equation of state , and therefore the system s tendency to expand is also reduced , cf .",

    "( due to the numerical dissipation adherent to any finite difference scheme that solves the hydrodynamical equations , the system cools slightly faster in the numerical calculation , cf .  figs .  7 ( b , f ) . )",
    "the effect of longitudinal cooling is reduced for larger values of @xmath131 , cf .",
    "( [ idgas ] ) .",
    "for instance , in the case @xmath139 the center still has @xmath146 when the transverse wave reaches it .",
    "the lifetimes for @xmath147 are therefore ( as expected ) a factor of 5 longer .    in fig .",
    "we show the situation for @xmath148 . as in the preceding case",
    ", it takes some time before the transverse expansion wave reaches the center .",
    "thus , the lifetimes of the highest temperatures in the system are solely determined by the longitudinal scaling solution presented above ( horizontal parts of the respective isotherms ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lifetimes for @xmath6 and this particular @xmath10 are not that exceedingly long as they were in the case of one  dimensional and spherical expansion .",
    "these long lifetimes were due to the slow velocity of the deflagration front .",
    "a deflagration solution , however , exists only for energy densities in the mixed phase , where matter is thermodynamically anomalous @xcite . here",
    ", the strong longitudinal motion cools the system quickly below the respective energy densities , such that the transverse expansion proceeds as a ( comparatively fast ) simple rarefaction wave instead of the deflagration .",
    "thus , the system cools even more quickly and the lifetimes are considerably reduced .",
    "this effect is , however , compensated when higher initial energy densities are considered . in fig .",
    "9 we show the solutions for @xmath149 .",
    "this case is close to the initial conditions expected from mini - jet production at rhic energies .",
    "now the initial energy density is sufficiently high that for @xmath6 the plasma enters the mixed phase at relatively late time ( @xmath150 fm for @xmath151 fm , see also fig .",
    "6 ( d ) ) .",
    "therefore , the time spent in the mixed phase is long enough in this case to allow a transverse deflagration front to form , cf .  figs .",
    "9 ( a , b ) . in comparison to the ideal gas case ( e , f ) , where no such solution exists , the expansion is therefore considerably prolonged .",
    "such a time delay is observed also for @xmath19 , figs .",
    "9 ( c , d ) , and is here due to the reduction of the velocity of sound in the transition region .",
    "we note that for @xmath139 , the initial energy density where one observes this effect is smaller , @xmath152 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath153 the initial time decreases with increasing initial energy density , enhancing the effect of longitudinal cooling , such that @xmath10 has to be very high ( @xmath154 ) for the onset of this effect .",
    "then , however , a steady increase of the initial energy density affects a steady decrease of @xmath131 such that one observes a prolongation of the lifetimes over a wider range of energy densities ( see also fig .  13 below ) . it",
    "is furthermore interesting to note that this phenomenon occurs at about the same initial energy densities ( in units of @xmath155 ) in the case @xmath37 ( cf .",
    "finally , for very high energy densities , one recovers the case of the violent explosion , and the lifetimes are again reduced .",
    "this happens at lower initial energy densities for the case @xmath156 , since the longitudinal motion is less effective in cooling the system .",
    "for @xmath153 we have not found a decrease in the lifetime up to the highest initial energy density studied by us , @xmath157 .",
    "the reason is , as mentioned above , that the increasingly more efficient cooling due to longitudinal motion compensates the increasing tendency of the system to explode transversally .",
    "in this section we first discuss the lifetimes of differently hot parts of the system ( defined as the intercept of a particular isotherm with the @xmath74axis ) as a function of the initial energy density . assuming that the system freezes out at these temperatures",
    ", we then show how the lifetimes can be inferred from two  particle correlation functions .      for convenience ,",
    "we first show in fig .",
    "10 the lifetimes as a function of @xmath10 for the one  dimensional ( landau ) expansion studied in @xcite . figs .  10 ( a ) and ( b ) are for the case @xmath89 , ( c ) and ( d ) are for @xmath90 . the thick lines in ( a",
    ", c ) show the lifetimes of matter with @xmath158 ( solid line ) , @xmath159 ( dotted ) , and @xmath160 ( dashed ) for @xmath6 , the corresponding lines in ( b , d ) are for finite @xmath19 . for comparison ,",
    "the thin lines are the corresponding lifetimes for the expansion of an ideal gas with @xmath7 degrees of freedom ( they are identical in ( a ) and ( b ) as well as in ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "one clearly observes the maximum in the lifetime of mixed phase matter ( @xmath160 ) at @xmath161 in figs .",
    "10 ( a , c ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this maximum vanishes for finite @xmath2 , figs .  10 ( b , d ) .",
    "moreover , such hot matter does not survive as long as in the ideal gas case .",
    "the lifetime of cooler matter with @xmath158 , however , stays longer than in the expansion of an ideal gas , independent of the value of @xmath2 .",
    "note the change in the scale of @xmath162 by a factor of 3 between ( a , b ) and ( c , d ) .",
    "this is due to the reduction of the latent heat for a smaller ratio @xmath28 , which in turn accelerates the expansion .",
    "11 shows the corresponding diagram for the spherical expansion .",
    "first of all , one notices that , at high @xmath10 , there is almost no difference between the lifetime of a system with a transition to the qgp and an ideal gas . inspecting fig .  5 , one observes , however , that the bulk of matter at finite @xmath69 does indeed live longer in the first case .",
    "thus , for the spherical expansion , our definition of ` lifetime ' should rather be replaced by an average over the particular isotherm .",
    "it is , however , not necessary to do so at this point , since the correlation functions considered subsequently will take this into account in a natural way .",
    "second , one observes that the lifetimes do not grow as strongly for high @xmath10 as in the one  dimensional expansion .",
    "this is due to the fact that the system disperses its initial internal energy much more efficiently into kinetic energy in three dimensions than it does in one dimension .",
    "this also leads to the reduction of the overall scale in the lifetimes as compared to fig .",
    "third , it is noticeable that the _ increase _ of the lifetime for @xmath6 at @xmath163 ( where the lifetime is maximum ) as compared to the ideal gas case is about a factor of 2 bigger than in the one  dimensional expansion .",
    "the prolongation of the lifetime is thus most pronounced in spherical geometry .",
    "unfortunately , the reduction of the lifetime in the case of a smooth transition is also rather strong , cf.figs .",
    "11 ( b , d ) .",
    "nevertheless , for freeze - out at @xmath158 the lifetime can still be longer by a factor of 2 in the case of a transition than in the expansion of an ideal gas .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the one  dimensional case , the spherical geometry leads to a ( broad ) maximum in the lifetime around @xmath44 .    in fig .",
    "12 we present the lifetimes for the expansion of a bjorken cylinder with initial time @xmath137 .",
    "one still observes the distinguished maximum in the lifetime associated with the transition to the qgp as seen in the preceding fig .",
    "11 . in this case , however , the overall scale is even smaller ( due to the fact that the system is from the very beginning quite effectively diluted by the longitudinal velocity field ) .    moreover , one observes a shift in the maximum of the lifetime .",
    "this was discussed in the preceding section and is due to the fact that the longitudinal motion compensates the tendency to explode transversally ( on account of a high initial energy density ) . for @xmath6",
    "the maximum is now around @xmath164 for _ both _ values of @xmath28 . for @xmath19 ,",
    "one still observes a maximum in the lifetimes , but as in fig .",
    "11 it is also broader and less pronounced .",
    "the corresponding plot for @xmath156 looks rather similar , and will therefore not be shown here .",
    "the position of the maximum is , however , shifted to smaller @xmath165 , for reasons discussed above .",
    "the situation for a dynamical @xmath153 is shown in fig .",
    "13 . as one expects from the above discussion",
    ", there is a steady increase of the lifetime up to the highest considered @xmath10 .      to calculate two  particle correlation functions we use the method developped by pratt @xcite",
    ", sinyukov @xcite and others , and applied to hydrodynamics by the marburg group @xcite .",
    "this method is essentially a straightforward generalization of the cooper ",
    "frye formula @xcite for single inclusive particle spectra to the case of correlation functions .    to calculate single inclusive particle spectra or two  particle correlation functions in the hydrodynamical framework",
    ", one assumes that a fluid element decouples from the fluid evolution ( `` freezes out '' ) as soon as the particle density drops below a certain critical value where the collision rate becomes too small to maintain ( local ) thermodynamical equilibrium . in our case ,",
    "the particle density depends on the temperature @xmath166 only .",
    "therefore , freeze - out happens across isotherms in the space  time diagram . to incorporate the freeze - out consistently into the solution of the hydrodynamical equations is a non - trivial problem .",
    "hydrodynamics is obviously not applicable to determine the motion of particles that are already frozen out .",
    "therefore , the hydrodynamical solution has to be restricted to a limited region of space  time .",
    "the main difficulty is that its boundary , i.e. , the freeze - out hypersurface , has to be determined _ dynamically _ , i.e. , simultaneously with the solution of the hydrodynamical equations .",
    "a possible treatment of this problem was recently proposed by bugaev @xcite , but has so far not been applied in practical calculations .",
    "commonly one circumvents this problem assuming the validity of the hydrodynamical description in the _ whole _ forward light cone , then solves the hydrodynamical equations , and determines the isotherms . finally , one employs the cooper ",
    "frye formula @xcite to calculate particle spectra along the isotherm corresponding to the particular freeze - out temperature ( for a detailed discussion of this approach see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the cooper  frye formalism holds rigorously only on space - like hypersurfaces . for time - like hypersurfaces it may yield negative numbers of particles emitted from the hypersurface ( corresponding to particles that do not freeze out but reenter the fluid ) . to cure this obviously unphysical result ,",
    "modifications have been proposed in @xcite .",

    "the fluid velocity varies , @xmath183 .    for symmetric systems ,",
    "the number of independent variables which @xmath184 depends on can be reduced .",
    "for the spherically symmetric fireball geometry , the orientation of the average momentum can be chosen arbitrarily , such that @xmath184 depends only on the modulus of @xmath185 .",
    "our choice of coordinate system will be such that @xmath186 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath187 can be decomposed into a so - called `` out '' component @xmath188 parallel to @xmath185 and a `` side '' component @xmath189 orthogonal to @xmath185 and @xmath190 .",
    "rotational symmetry around the direction of @xmath185 allows us to choose @xmath191 , such that the correlation function depends only on three independent variables , @xmath192 .",
    "for the bjorken cylinder geometry , we restrict our consideration to particles emitted at midrapidity , @xmath193",
    ". rotational symmetry around the @xmath77axis allows us to choose the average transverse momentum as @xmath194 , and consequently , @xmath195 , @xmath196 .",
    "again , @xmath197 is a function of three independent variables only . the explicit evaluation of ( [ c2 ] ) for the fireball and bjorken cylinder geometry is referred to appendices a and b , respectively .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the width of the correlation function in out ",
    "direction is inversely proportional to the duration of particle emission , i.e. , to the lifetime of the source .",
    "analogously , the inverse width of the correlation function in side ",
    "direction is a measure for the ( transverse ) size of the source . to be more precise , for fixed average ( transverse ) momentum @xmath198 we define side and out  correlation functions as @xmath199 and @xmath200 , respectively .",
    "we furthermore define a corresponding inverse width as @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is determined by @xmath203 , and analogously for @xmath17 .",
    "we emphasize that we do not attempt a standard gaussian fit of the two  particle correlation function , which would relate the inverse widths to the usual radii parameters .",
    "first of all , we will be interested only in the generic shape of the correlation functions which is satisfactorily characterized by their inverse widths @xmath204 .",
    "second , the functional form of the correlation functions is not a gaussian ( cf .  the explicit formulae in appendix a and b ) .",
    "the fit procedure would therefore only introduce unnecessary errors .",
    "third , the radii parameters as well as the inverse widths are only _ proportional _ to the actual ( average ) size and lifetime of the system .",
    "it is well known that hydrodynamical flow affects the radii parameters / widths , and , moreover , that this effect is sensitive to the choice of @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore tedious ( if not impossible ) to relate @xmath16 and @xmath17 to the real source size and lifetime .",
    "this holds for our model calculations as well as for the experiment .",
    "we can expect , however , that such effects are either irrelevant or largely cancel out if we consider the ratio @xmath205 . as can be inferred from the space ",
    "time diagrams in figs .",
    "35 and 79 , while the size of the system is approximately constant , it is the lifetime that varies appreciably , depending on whether the system undergoes a phase transition or not .",
    "thus , @xmath205 can be expected to be a good measure for the lifetime of the system . in the following ,",
    "we choose the particles to be pions with mass @xmath206 mev , and as average momentum @xmath207 mev . on one hand",
    ", this value is well within the typical experimental acceptance . on the other hand",
    ", it is large enough to exhibit effects of the prolonged lifetime in the case of a transition to the qgp @xcite . to fix the @xmath208scale in mev we take @xmath209 fm as a typical initial radius of the system .    in fig .",
    "14 we show as an example side and out  correlation functions corresponding to the hydrodynamical evolution of fig .  4 .",
    "in light of the uncertainties in the actual freeze - out temperature , we calculate the correlation functions along isotherms for @xmath210 , as well as @xmath211 .",
    "first of all , one immediately recognizes that in all cases the widths of the correlation functions correspond closely to the space ",
    "time structure of the corresponding isotherms .",
    "for instance , the exceedingly long lifetime of the system in fig .  4 ( b )",
    "is reflected in the comparatively small width of the out ",
    "correlation function fig .  14 ( b ) .",
    "on the other hand , the transverse size is about the same in all cases , cf .",
    "figs .  4 ( b , d , f ) , which reflects in nearly identical side  correlation functions in figs .  14 ( a , c , e ) .",
    "furthermore , with the exception of the case @xmath19 , the correlation functions are almost completely insensitive to the freeze - out temperature chosen .",
    "this is intuitively clear since the corresponding space ",
    "time isotherms differ only marginally for @xmath6 and the ideal gas calculation , cf .",
    "figs .  4 ( b , f ) , while there are larger differences in fig .  4 ( d ) .",
    "note that the results shown in figs .",
    "14 ( a , b , e , f ) correspond nicely to those in fig .  4 of @xcite , in spite of the fact that the latter calculation employs inhomogeneous initial conditions , a different way to solve the hydrodynamical equations , and a different treatment of the freeze - out . in fig .",
    "15 we show the correlation functions corresponding to the hydrodynamical evolution of fig .  9 .",
    "again , they adequately characterize the space  time geometry of the source .",
    "16 shows the experimentally measurable ratio @xmath205 as a function of @xmath10 for the spherical fireball geometry . comparing the results with fig .  11",
    ", one observes that this ratio reflects closely the behaviour of the lifetime of the system , independent of details in the equation of state such as the width of the transition region @xmath2 or the latent heat of the transition ( which is proportional to @xmath28 ) . also , for the case of a first order transition , @xmath6 , figs .",
    "16 ( a , c ) , the enhancement in @xmath205 over the ideal gas case is a factor of 3 to 7 ( for @xmath212 to @xmath213 ) at @xmath214 . in the case of a smooth transition , @xmath19 , figs.16 ( b , d ) ,",
    "this is considerably reduced ( as expected from fig .",
    "11 ) , but if the system freezes out at temperatures @xmath215 , there is still a factor of 2 enhancement over the ideal gas case .    in figs .",
    "17 , 18 we present the corresponding results for the bjorken cylinder expansion with @xmath141 and @xmath216 , respectively . in all cases",
    "we find that the experimentally measurable ratio of correlation widths mirrors closely the dependence of the lifetime on initial conditions in figs .  12 , 13 . the most favourable case @xmath217 ( for a strong first order transition with a large latent heat , @xmath89 , cf .",
    "17 ( a ) ) , may be reached with initial conditions expected at rhic energies . at that point",
    "the enhancement of this ratio is about a factor of 2 above the ideal gas case and virtually independent of the freeze - out temperature . in the scenario with @xmath216 , fig .",
    "18 ( a ) , the enhancement is somewhat smaller and is shifted toward higher initial energy densities because the initial pure bjorken expansion phase starts earlier than in the fixed @xmath137 case . for a smooth transition with @xmath19 , the maximum ratio is reduced to 2.5 and varies less rapidly with @xmath10 , but is still about @xmath218 larger than for the ideal gas expansion . in this case , however , a significant time delay can only be observed if the freeze - out occurs relatively late with @xmath219 . as seen in figs .",
    "17 , 18 , for earlier freeze - out , smaller @xmath131 , or smaller @xmath28 the enhancement relative to the ideal gas case is significantly reduced and would be more difficult to observe .    at energy densities estimated to be reached in cern sps pb+pb  collisions ( @xmath220 in our units ) , we expect from our results that @xmath221 .",
    "however , present data from cern sps @xcite indicate that the ( fitted ) out  radii are rather similar to the side  radii .",
    "this does not contradict our results , because , as shown by schlei et al .",
    "@xcite in the framework of a hydrodynamical calculation similar to ours , correlation functions constructed from thermal pions only give @xmath222 ( cf .  especially @xcite ) , while the incorporation of long - lived _ resonance decays _ leads to a reduction of that ratio and good agreement with the measured radii .",
    "we note that kaon interferometry @xcite is preferable , though experimentally more difficult , because only distortions of the interference pattern due to shorter lived @xmath223 resonances have to be taken into account .",
    "in this paper we investigated the spherically symmetric expansion of a fireball as well as the cylindrically symmetric transverse expansion of a qgp with boost - invariant initial conditions along the beam axis .",
    "the expansion was treated in the framework of ideal relativistic hydrodynamics and extends our systematic study @xcite of collective flow patterns with realistic equations of state .",
    "the symmetries of the considered geometries allowed us to calculate the flow patterns using a simple modification of a well - tested one  dimensional algorithm .",
    "the emphasis of the present investigation was on how a rapid cross - over to the qgp in the equation of state influences the collective expansion dynamics .",
    "in particular , since present lattice data only constrain the width of the transition region to the qgp to be in the range @xmath224 , it is important to test how such uncertainties may influence dynamical observables .",
    "we also studied the effect of varying the ratio of degrees of freedom in the qgp and hadron phase ( i.e.  essentially the latent heat of the transition ) on the system dynamics .",
    "the results were compared to the expansion of an ultrarelativistic ideal gas ( without transition ) using fixed energy density initial conditions .",
    "we focussed on the lifetime of the system as a function of initial energy density as an important _ collective _ observable that can discriminate between different equations of state .",
    "as expected from previous one  dimensional studies in the framework of the landau expansion model @xcite , we found that the lifetime of a spherical fireball is much longer in the case of a first order phase transition , @xmath6 , as compared to the expansion of an ideal gas without transition .",
    "the prolongation of the lifetime in that case can be up to a factor of 4.5 to 9 ( for @xmath90 to @xmath213 , respectively ) , provided the initial energy density corresponds to that of mixed phase with a large fraction of qgp .",
    "this time delay effect was originally pointed out by pratt @xcite . in the case of a smooth transition , @xmath225 ,",
    "however , this time delay is drastically reduced . the lifetimes",
    "( of matter with @xmath158 ) nevertheless still remain on the order of a factor of 2 longer as compared to the ideal gas expansion .    for the bjorken cylinder expansion , it is also necessary to specify the initial ( proper ) time @xmath131 for the onset of hydrodynamic expansion . to explore uncertainties",
    "associated with this additional degree of freedom , we investigated the cases @xmath226 , and a dynamical @xmath227 varying with the initial temperature .",
    "the results were similar as for the spherical expansion , up to two important exceptions : ( a ) the maximum lifetimes emerged at higher initial energy densities ( the exact value of which depends on the choice of @xmath131 ) corresponding to qgp matter instead of mixed phase matter , and ( b ) the lifetimes were in general shorter .",
    "both effects are explained by the very efficient cooling due to the initial longitudinal velocity profile associated with the boost invariance of the problem .",
    "this effect causes an overall reduction of the lifetimes .",
    "moreover , in order for slow ( van hove @xcite ) deflagration fronts to dominate the cooling mechanism in transverse direction , one has to start at higher initial energy densities to compensate for the longitudinal cooling .",
    "otherwise , the longitudinal cooling reduces the energy densities too fast and the associated deflagration solution @xcite vanishes .",
    "further cooling is then achieved ( in the usual way ) through a ( fast ) simple wave .",
    "finally , we showed ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) that the prolongation of the lifetime can be observable via the ratio @xmath205 of inverse widths of two  particle correlation functions in out and side  direction .",
    "this ratio follows the behaviour of the lifetimes rather closely",
    ". the prolongation of the lifetime in the case of a transition to the qgp could therefore be in principle searched for using this observable .",
    "the enhancement of that ratio is , of course , strongest in the case that the transition is first order with a large latent heat .",
    "an interesting result is that , for the fireball geometry , the effect is maximum for energy densities achieved at the ags , while for the bjorken cylinder geometry , the maximum of @xmath205 occurs at energy densities presumably reached at the rhic collider .",
    "there are several effects which may reduce the strength of the time ",
    "delay signal observable via the @xmath205ratios that will require further investigation .",
    "first , for the fireball geometry it is important to extend our considerations to finite baryon number density . at finite chemical potential",
    "the width of the cross - over region may be significantly larger than at zero chemical potential .",
    "second , the decay of long - lived resonances can simulate time delay @xcite .",
    "interferometry with kaons instead of pions is therefore preferable @xcite .",
    "finally , while our investigations covered a wide range of uncertainties in the equation of state , our calculations have neglected effects of dissipation that tend in general to reduce the collective flow strengths predicted via ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "for instance , bulk viscosity appears in the hydrodynamical equations of motion in a similar way as the pressure , and could in principle counteract any reduction of the velocity of sound in the transition region .",
    "the main result of this paper is , nevertheless , that the generic time  delay signature of qgp formation is remarkable robust to present uncertainties in the qcd equation of state",
