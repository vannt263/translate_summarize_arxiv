    "one of the general predictions of structure formation within the prevailing cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm is that galaxy - scale dark matter haloes should be described by a triaxial density ellipsoid ( e.g. , jing & suto 2002 ; bailin & steinmetz 2005 ; allgood et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) . the characteristic axial ratios of these haloes are typically expected to be far from spherical ( see , e.g. , bullock et al . 2002 ; kuhlen et al .",
    "2007 ; and references therein ) with characteristic central minor / major axis ratios ( in the isovelocity contours ) @xmath7 and intermediate / major axis ratios @xmath8 ( hayashi et al .",
    "2007 ) . adopting the triaxiality parameter of franx et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , @xmath9 this corresponds to a typical value of @xmath10 . as discussed by hayashi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , there can be significant variation of the axis ratios with radius and between realizations of similar mass haloes : individual values for @xmath11 range from @xmath12 while @xmath13 can take values @xmath14 .",
    "despite the near - ubiquitous predictions of triaxiality from such simulations , there has hitherto been little observational evidence to confirm triaxiality in specific individual galaxies : while gravitational lensing ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",
    "2004 ; mandelbaum et al . 2006",
    "; evans et al . 2009 ) and x - ray observations ( e.g. , pointecouteau et al . 2005 ) have indicated that non - sphericity appears to be common in dark matter haloes , such studies are sensitive only to the integral of the density profile along the line of sight and do not provide fully 3-d information .",
    "the milky way galaxy provides perhaps the best laboratory for testing predictions of halo sphericity since the tidal stream remnants of dwarf satellites orbiting in the galactic halo can be traced in three dimensions and provide sensitive probes of the underlying mass distribution .",
    "the tidal tails emanating from the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ) have been used for such efforts since shortly after the discovery of the dwarf by ibata et al .",
    "early efforts to model the mw  sgr system ( e.g. , johnston et al . 1995 , 1999 ; velazquez & white 1995 ; edelsohn & elmegreen 1997 ; ibata et al . 1997 ; gmez - flechoso et al .",
    "1999 ; helmi & white 2001 ) generally concentrated on fitting the orbit of sgr within an adopted milky way potential .",
    "in more recent years however , compelling wide - field views of the extensive tidal streams associated with the dwarf have been provided by the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; belokorov et al .",
    "2006 ) , and permitted much more detailed exploration of the underlying shape of the galactic potential to be undertaken by helmi ( 2004 ) , martnez - delgado et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2007 ) , law , johnston , & majewski ( 2005 ; hereafter ljm05 ) , fellhauer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and cole et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . despite the prediction from cdm theory that the milky way should be best described by a triaxial galactic potential , the majority of models to date ( although cf .",
    "gnedin et al .",
    "2005 ) have adopted an axisymmetric framework in which flattening is introduced only into the galactic @xmath15 axis ( i.e. perpendicular to the galactic disk ) .",
    "while these recent simulations agree on many aspects of the sgr orbit , no one model has yet been capable of reproducing all of the observational data and these models reach different conclusions about the shape of the galactic halo depending on which observational data are weighted as primary constraints : some studies favor a mildly oblate halo ( e.g. , johnston et al . 2005 [ hereafter jlm05 ] ; martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2007 ) , some an approximately spherical halo ( e.g. , ibata et al . 2001 ; fellhauer et al . 2006 ) , and others a prolate halo ( e.g. , helmi 2004 ) .",
    "the crux of this `` halo conundrum '' ( highlighted by ljm05 , and also discussed by fellhauer et al .",
    "2006 , martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2007 , newberg et al .",
    "2007 , and yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) is that in an axisymmetric galactic potential it is not possible to simultaneously fit both the angular precession and distance / apparent radial velocity of stars in the leading sgr stream as it arcs through the north galactic cap towards the galactic anticenter . in order to match the angular coordinates of stars in the sgr leading arm jlm05 and fellhauer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) required mildly oblate or nearly spherical models ( with @xmath15-axis flattening @xmath16 in the contours of the gravitational potential ) for the galactic dark halo .",
    "such models cause the leading arm to reenter the galactic disk in the vicinity of the sun ( to within @xmath17 kpc ) , in contradiction with photometric distance estimates ( e.g. , newberg et al . 2007 ) from sdss .",
    "such a model also predicts a significant projection of the orbital velocities of leading tidal debris onto the observed line of sight , in contrast to spectroscopic radial velocity data ( presented by law et al .",
    "2004 , ljm05 , and more recently confirmed by yanny et al . 2009 ) . in order to reproduce the radial velocity and distance trends the halo must be prolate with @xmath18 ( as demonstrated by helmi et al .",
    "2004 and confirmed by ljm05 ) , but this in turn can not account for the observed precession experienced by the tidal debris .    in this letter we demonstrate that this `` halo conundrum '' is a consequence of the near - ubiquitous adoption of axisymmetric models for the galactic potential . by using fully triaxial models , similar to those predicted by standard cdm theory , it is possible to simultaneously satisfy all constraints imposed by the structure of sgr debris on the milky way s mass distribution .",
    "we adopt a basic formalism similar to that described by ljm05 ( and described in greater detail by law et al . , _ in prep . _ ) in which the milky way is described by a smooth fixed gravitational potential consisting of a miyamoto - nagai ( 1975 ) disk , hernquist spheroid , and a logarithmic halo . the respective contribution of these components to the gravitational potential",

    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 are given by @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 this form for the halo potential permits flattening to be introduced along the three axes @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where @xmath30 represents the flattening perpendicular to the galactic plane , while @xmath28 and @xmath29 are free to rotate in the galactic plane at an angle @xmath31 to a right - handed galactocentric @xmath32 coordinate system , @xmath28 is aligned with the galactic @xmath4 axis and eqn .",
    "[ haloeqn ] reduces to @xmath33^{2}+[y / q_2]^2+[z / q_z]^2+r_{\\rm halo}^{2})$ ] . ] . since it is only the _ ratios _ between these @xmath34 that have physical significance , we fix @xmath35 and explore the effects of varying @xmath28 and @xmath30 in the range @xmath36 , with @xmath37",
    ". we do not consider the range @xmath38 since our formulation of the galactic gravitational potential rapidly becomes unphysical for larger values .",
    "we note that this method introduces the flattening directly into the gravitational potential ( i.e. the isovelocity contours ) for ease of calculation and consistency with previous studies ( e.g. , ljm05 ) .",
    "we have also considered more physical models in which axial flattenings are introduced into the density profile of an nfw ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 ) halo model , and the resulting accelerations computed using the approximate form of the potential given by lee & suto ( 2003 ) .",
    "such models give slightly different orbital paths , but the qualitative results discussed below remain essentially unchanged .",
    "we assume that the sun is located 8.0 kpc from the galactic center and 28 kpc from the sgr core ( siegel et al .",
    "we fix various constants in equations [ diskeqn ] - [ haloeqn ] based on previous work by ljm05 , adopting @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 kpc , @xmath42 kpc , @xmath43 kpc , @xmath44 kpc .",
    "similarly , the position , radial velocity , and instantaneous orbital plane of the sgr dwarf are fixed as discussed in ljm05 ( see also law et al . , in prep ) .    for each combination of @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31",
    "tested we proceed as follows ; ( 1 ) we fixed @xmath45 in equation [ haloeqn ] so that the lsr has an orbital velocity @xmath46 km s@xmath47 .",
    "( 2 ) while the dynamics of the _ leading _ arm of sgr tidal debris are strongly dependent on the choice of galactic potential , the _ trailing _ arm experiences very little precession and its characteristic angular position ( majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) and radial velocities ( majewski et al .",
    "2004 ) can be well reproduced in any realistic model of the galactic potential given suitable choice of the speed @xmath48 of sgr perpendicular to the line of sight ( as demonstrated by ljm05 ) .",
    "we therefore adjusted @xmath48 until the best match to the trailing debris data was obtained .",
    "( 3 ) massless test - particles were integrated along the orbit , and the quality of fit @xmath49 to the observational data calculated .",
    "the accuracy of such test - particle orbits will necessarily be limited since actual tidal debris ( with a range of orbital energies and angular momenta ) from massive satellites will deviate slightly from these orbits ; leading / trailing arms will fall inside / outside the orbital path respectively ( see , e.g. , discussion by johnston et al .",
    "1995 , 1999 ; choi et al .",
    "2007 ; eyre & binney 2009 ) .",
    "however , previous work ( e.g. , ljm05 ) has demonstrated that for sgr the test - particle orbits provide a good indication of the general trend of tidal debris ( particularly for the observational constraints upon which we focus ) and suffice for the first - order estimate of the underlying gravitational potential presented here .",
    "we first illustrate the spirit of our results with the specific case of @xmath50 ( i.e. @xmath51 ) . in figure [ orbitcompare.fig ]",
    "we plot radial velocity ( with respect to the galactic standard of rest [ gsr ] ) and declination along the section of orbit leading the sgr dwarf for models in which the milky way is taken to have various values of @xmath52 and @xmath30 . while the trend of radial velocity is strongly affected by the choice of @xmath30 ( i.e. different colors in upper panels of fig .",
    "[ orbitcompare.fig ] ) , @xmath52 has a comparatively minor effect on the velocities ( difference between solid / dotted / dashed lines of a given color ) in the key range @xmath53 . in contrast , both @xmath52 and @xmath30 affect the precession of the leading arm as characterized by its declination @xmath54 for a given @xmath55 or @xmath56 coordinate . as shown in the lower panels of figure [ orbitcompare.fig ] , increasing @xmath30 shifts the arm to greater @xmath54 for fixed @xmath52 ( i.e. changing from black , to orange , to magenta curves for a given line type in fig .",
    "[ orbitcompare.fig ] ) , and increasing @xmath52 decreases @xmath54 for fixed @xmath30 ( i.e. changing from solid , to dotted , to dashed curves for a given line color in fig .",
    "[ orbitcompare.fig ] ) .",
    "these trends indicate that while both @xmath52 and @xmath30 govern the angular precession of the stream , it is primarily @xmath30 that affects the distance to the leading arm , altering the projection of the orbital velocity onto the line of sight .    in the special case of @xmath50 , @xmath30 and @xmath28",
    "are clearly separable parameters which may be constrained in turn .",
    "in general however , @xmath30 and @xmath28 are not separable and must be constrained in tandem so that the resulting tidal stream matches both the apparent radial velocity and the observed angular precession . in figure [ obsdata.fig ]",
    "we summarize the three most relevant observational constraints : trailing arm velocity data from majewski et al .",
    "( 2004 ; open circles ) , leading arm angular coordinates from belokurov et al .",
    "( 2006 ; open trianges ) , and leading arm radial velocities from law et al .",
    "( 2004 ; see also ljm05 and majewski et al .",
    "_ in prep .",
    "_ ; open boxes ) . while there is evidence for a `` bifurcation '' in the sgr leading stream ( belokurov et al",
    "2006 ) , we assume that the centroid of the stream is represented by the main , highest surface - brightness ` southern ' branch ( see discussion by yanny et al . 2009 ; law et al . in prep ) . as discussed in  [ model.sec ] , it is possible to fit the trailing arm velocity data in most reasonable models of the galactic potential with suitable choice of the velocity of sgr along its orbit , and all of our models are designed to do so .",
    "we define a @xmath57 statistic characterizing the quality of fit of the sgr orbit in our various models of the galactic halo to the angular coordinates and velocity data : @xmath58 - v_{\\rm obs , lead } [ i])^2}{\\sigma_{v}^2 } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we adopt an uncertainty @xmath62 km  s@xmath63for each radial velocity measurement ( this represents a combination of observational uncertainty and intrinsic stream width ; see discussion in majewski et al .",
    "2004 ) , and @xmath64 for each survey field location from belokurov et al .",
    "the radial velocity @xmath65 and angular location @xmath66 of the orbit at each longitudinal position ( @xmath67 $ ] or @xmath68 $ ] respectively ) is determined via linear interpolation of the orbital path .    in figure [ phifig.fig ]",
    "we show the values of @xmath49 resulting from various choices for @xmath31 , @xmath28 , and @xmath30 .",
    "values of @xmath69 ( i.e. @xmath28 nearly aligned with the galactic @xmath6 axis ) are strongly favored and are the only models in which values of @xmath70 can be obtained . given the limitations of the orbit - fitting method , it is not possible to conclusively discriminate between @xmath28@xmath30 pairs in the triaxial region of parameter space @xmath71 ( green / cyan / blue lines respectively in fig .",
    "[ phifig.fig ] ) and @xmath72 since deviations of the actual tidal debris from the orbital path of the bound satellite are expected to have an effect comparable in magnitude to the computed values of @xmath73 .",
    "more detailed fitting incorporating finer sampling scales in @xmath30 , @xmath28 , and @xmath31 in combination with comprehensive n - body models is beyond the scope of the present work and will be presented by law et al .",
    "( in prep ) ; at present we note simply that the absolute minimum ( @xmath74 ) occurs for @xmath50 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "the laplacian of this potential is everywhere positive , indicating that it corresponds to a physically realizable density distribution .",
    "in ljm05 we conducted an extensive parameter space search exploring the effects of varying the galactic disk / bulge mass , the dark halo scale length , sgr kinematics , the distance to the galactic center , the distance to sgr , and the total mass scale of the milky way .",
    "no variation of these parameters gave rise to a model in which it was possible to simultaneously reproduce all three observational constraints ( trailing velocities , leading precession , leading velocities ) on the sgr stream in an axisymmetric galactic halo . in figure [ obsdata.fig ]",
    "we overplot on the observational constraints the orbits in an axisymmetric halo that best fit individual constraints : the black curve is chosen to best - fit the angular precession of the leading arm ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) , while the green curve is chosen to best fit the radial velocity trend of the leading arm ( @xmath77 , @xmath75 ) .",
    "these models have quality - of - fit parameters @xmath79 respectively .",
    "in contrast , the red curve in figure [ obsdata.fig ] represents our best - fit orbit in a triaxial halo with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath50 : in this model the orbit of the sgr dwarf simultaneously reproduces both the observed run of angular precession and radial velocity for the leading arm .",
    "the corresponding ratios for the minor / major ( @xmath82 ) and intermediate / major ( @xmath83 ) axis ratios in this triaxial halo are broadly consistent with the typical values predicted by cosmological simulations ( e.g. , hayashi et al . 2007 ) , although the best - fit triaxiality parameter @xmath84 is somewhat lower than anticipated .",
    "while the fit may change somewhat with detailed n - body models , we can conclude not only that the galactic dark halo may be triaxial within the orbit of sgr ( @xmath85 kpc ) , but that the short / long axes of the halo may be aligned with the galactic @xmath86 axes respectively to within @xmath5 .",
    "if the axial flattenings are introduced into an nfw model of the dark matter density distribution , qualitatively similar results are obtained with @xmath87 . as expected ( e.g. , kuhlen et al .",
    "2007 ) the isovelocity contours are more spherical than the isodensity contours , but both indicate a similar preference for a triaxial system in which the major / minor axes are approximately aligned with the galactic @xmath6/@xmath4 axes respectively .",
    "this alignment is somewhat similar to that of the _ stellar _ halo described by newberg & yanny ( 2006 ) , who found a major axis similarly aligned with the galactic @xmath6 axis to within @xmath88 , albeit with a minor axis along @xmath15 rather than @xmath4 .",
    "there is no clear correlation however with the triaxiality of the galactic bulge : the long axis of the bar is currently though to lie within @xmath89 of the galactic @xmath4 axis ( e.g. , nakada et al .",
    "1991 ; morris & serabyn 1996 ; babusiaux & gilmore 2005 ) , close to the minor axis of the dark halo .    in closing , we note two complications of the above results . first , our analysis has assumed that the disk lies in one of the symmetry planes of the halo potential and that the axes themselves do not twist with radius .",
    "while such assumptions should be explored with future studies , we do not expect the broad results of our study to change  an orientation significantly out of a symmetry plane would result in warping of the disk , which would dampen the misalignment on timescales of a few disk orbits ( e.g. , dubinski & kuijken 1995 ; bailin et al . 2007 ;",
    "jeon et al .",
    "second , in the family of models presented here the galactic @xmath15 axis is the intermediate axis of the triaxial ellipsoid . in a global sense",
    "such models are somewhat unsatisfactory since orbits about this axis ( i.e. in the plane of the galactic disk ) are expected to be unstable ( e.g. , binney et al . 1981 ) . at present , however , such models are the only ones in which it is possible to simultaneously reproduce all of the observed characteristics of the sgr stream .",
