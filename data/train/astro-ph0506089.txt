    "psr b1706@xmath044 , discovered by @xcite is among the most interesting pulsars for study at high energies .",
    "it is one of a handful of pulsars detected by egret in gev @xmath1-rays .",
    "it is quite similar to the vela pulsar with a characteristic age @xmath2yr and a spindown luminosity of @xmath3 erg / s , but is @xmath4 more distant at @xmath5kpc .",
    "early _ chandra _ hrc / acis data provided a first detection of x - ray pulsations and showed a compact @xmath6 surrounding pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) @xcite .",
    "more recent _ xmm - newton _",
    "spectroscopy @xcite has provided improved measurements of the x - ray spectrum and pulsations .",
    "early claims that the pwn is detected in tev @xmath1-rays @xcite have not been supported by recent hess observations @xcite .",
    "psr b1706@xmath044 is superposed on a radio - bright spur of the supernova remnant g343.1@xmath02.3 , which has a similar , albeit unreliable , @xmath7 distance of @xmath8kpc @xcite .",
    "the pulsar dm gives a distance of @xmath9kpc in the @xcite model .",
    "@xcite have argued for an association . in particular",
    ", they found a faint southern extension of the snr , which would place the pulsar within the full snr boundary .",
    "they also noted an approximately n - s elongation of the x - ray pwn , pointing roughly back to the snr center and argued that this would represent a trailed nebula .",
    "the required velocity for travel from the approximate geometric center of the snr , about @xmath10 away , was @xmath11km / s where @xmath12 is the pulsar age in units of @xmath13yr .",
    "there are , however , some challenges to this snr association .",
    "@xcite in an hi absorption study of the pulsar found velocity components setting lower and upper bounds for the distance of @xmath14kpc and @xmath15kpc .",
    "however a prominent hi emission feature seen in the bright limb of g343.1@xmath02.3 at @xmath16km / s is not seen by koribalski et al . in the absorption spectrum of the pulsar , suggesting that it lies in front of the snr .",
    "also scintillation studies @xcite suggest a low transverse velocity for the pulsar , @xmath17km / s . this estimate has been supported by more recent scintillation measurements ( johnston , priv .",
    "thus the distances of the pulsar and snr are still fairly uncertain .",
    "we adopt here a generic distance of 3kpc in the discussion that follows , but carry through the scaling to show the distance dependence .",
    "@xcite re - examined the ao1 50ks hrc and @xmath18ks acis - s exposures , and found that the compact pwn could be well modeled as an equatorial torus + polar jets , rather similar to the structures seen around the young crab and vela pulsars .",
    "they found that the brightest arc of pwn emission lay _ behind _ the pulsar s inferred motion from the snr center , while a polar jet extended well in front of the pulsar position .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with a bow shock / trail interpretation . on the other hand ,",
    "the pwn symmetry axis did indeed point back to the snr center , suggesting that a more careful evaluation of the connection was in order .",
    "this is particularly interesting , since comparison of the pwn symmetry (= pulsar spin ) and proper motion axes can constrain the origin of pulsar birth kicks @xcite .",
    "we have obtained a deeper 100ks acis - i exposure of psr b1706@xmath044 and surroundings .",
    "the x - ray exposure coverage is compared to the overall geometry of g343.1@xmath02.3 in figure 1 .",
    "together with new atca radio continuum imaging we are able to study the rich structure in this pwn and further constrain its connections with the snr .",
    "psr b1706@xmath044 was observed with the _ chandra _ acis - i array ( 4 acis - i chips along with the s3 and s4 chips ) on february 1 - 2 , 2004 with standard imaging ( 3.2s te ) exposures .",
    "the ccd array was operated in ` very faint ' ( vf ) mode , allowing improved rejection of particle backgrounds .",
    "the total live - time was 98.8ks and no episodes of strong background flaring were observed .",
    "hence all data are included in our analysis .",
    "the pulsar was positioned near the standard aimpoint of the i3 chip and all observing conditions were normal .",
    "we have also compared our new exposure with the archival ( february 3 , 2001 ) 14.3ks acis - s3 exposure ( obsid 0757 ) . as usual the backside illuminated s3 chip suffered more from particle background and after cutting out periods of background flares , 11ks of clean exposure remained .",
    "all analysis was performed using ciao 3.2 and caldb 3.0.0 , including automatic correction for the acis qe degradation .",
    "these data were nearly free of pile - up ; the maximum pixel counts at the pulsar position indicate only @xmath19% pile - up while the best fit model for the point source has an expected pile up fraction of @xmath20% . for sources with low pile - up we can maximize the spatial resolution of the acis image by removing the standard pixel randomization and applying an algorithm correcting the position of split pixel events @xcite .",
    "this decreases the on - axis psf width in our data set by @xmath21% .",
    "these data are compared with radio observations of the pwn .",
    "data for the radio maps shown here were collected at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in narrabri ( latitude -30.3@xmath22 ) @xcite . for the 1.4ghz map in figures 1 and 2a , the data acquisition and analysis",
    "are described in @xcite . for the image contours in figure 3a ,",
    "the data first presented in @xcite were re - imaged including the 6 km baselines and uniform weighting to highlight the high resolution features .",
    "the restoring beam size is @xmath23 . to show the nebular structure ,",
    "an 11mjy point source psf has been subtracted at the position of the pulsar .",
    "two maxima appear flanking the pulsar position .",
    "these are unlikely to be artifacts due to pulsar variability , as diffractive scintillation for this pulsar is particularly weak @xcite .",
    "since the data were collected in five sessions , spread over more than a year , it is in principal possible for slow refractive scintillation to change the pulsar flux between epochs and distort its psf .",
    "however , each epoch used @xmath2412h of integration , so any residual epoch psf should be close to circularly symmetric , in contrast to the structure near the pulsar which is clearly bipolar . further observations , with pulsar binning , have been requested to confirm this result .    for the 4.8ghz map in figure 2b , observations were made at 4.8- and 8.6ghz with the array in the standard configurations 0.75a , 1.5a and 6a on 06 jan , 16 feb and 11 apr 2002 .",
    "the maximum and minimum baselines for the 4.8-ghz data were 1 and 100 k@xmath25 ( angular resolutions of @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) for a total of 26 hours observation .",
    "in all cases we observed the two frequencies with bandwidths of 128 mhz .",
    "we used the atnf correlator mode that divides each integration s data into separate phase bins spanning the pulsar period .",
    "this firstly allowed the strongly pulsed point source flux to be excluded from the image and secondly allowed us to self - calibrate using the relatively strong point source flux from the pulsar .",
    "after data editing and calibrating we inverted the image with a _ uv_-taper of @xmath28 and deconvolved it with the full polarization maximum entropy task pmosmem in miriad .",
    "the most important test of the snr association would , of course , be a direct astrometric proper motion . with a 1.4ghz flux of @xmath2411mjy ,",
    "psr b1706@xmath044 is relatively bright . as such it is suitable for phase referenced vlbi astrometry , if an in - beam reference could be found .",
    "unfortunately searches for phase references adequate for australian long baseline array ( lba ) and us vlba experiments have not detected comparison sources with compact fluxes greater than @xmath29mjy .",
    "attempts were made at external phase reference vlba astrometry .",
    "however at 1.4ghz , the nearest known reference source ( 2.5@xmath22 away ) was scatter broadened to @xmath30mas .",
    "with the strong ionosphere at such low elevation , the next nearest known source ( 10@xmath22 away ) is too distant for effective calibration .",
    "since the pulsar spectrum is steep , an attempt at vlba astrometry at 5ghz was also unsuccessful ; at this low elevation the system temperature was @xmath31 nominal and only six vlba antennae could be used , reducing the sensitivity to @xmath32 of nominal .",
    "so unfortunately we have only tied - array astrometry at present .",
    "even if the pulsar does travel from the geometric center of g343.1@xmath02.3 , the expected proper motion is only @xmath33mas / yr ; the existing time base of vla / atca imaging does not yet allow a serious constraint on this motion .",
    "we must conclude that a direct proper motion measurement awaits substantially increased ( ska or evla ) capabilities and a long - duration , large base - line experiment .      to show the diffuse emission surrounding psr b1706@xmath044 we plot ( fig .",

    "in particular @xcite have described a series of acis images of the vela nebula which show a torus - like structure , an inner jet and counter jet and a faint narrow outer jet system .",
    "this imaging sequence showed that the vela outer jet , which is patchy and strongly bent , varies dramatically on timescales of days to weeks .",

    "this implies that the rotation axis controls the pwn symmetry to large radii .",

    "[ pwnspec ]    note that there is significant softening of the extended emission as one progresses to larger scales and that the jet components appear to be the hardest of all .",
    "this is certainly consistent with the idea that the central pulsar supplies fresh energetic electrons and that synchrotron burn - off increasingly softens the spectrum as older populations are viewed in the outer pwn .",
    "again this trend is common in the well - measured young pwne .",
    "allowing the photon index to vary for the different nebula components , the best fit to a global absorption value for the extended emission gives us our fiducial @xmath52 .",
    "this is consistent with free - fit values for the point source , but given complexities of the composite thermal+power law model , we consider the nebular fit value more robust .",
    "note that with dm=75.7 @xmath53 , the @xmath54 for this sight - line is large , but not unprecedented for low @xmath55 pulsars .",
    "this is also consistent with the @xmath56 absorption measurements and a fiducial snr distance @xmath8kpc , given the appreciable uncertainties .",
    "a number of authors have discussed the evolution of a pwn within an expanding supernova remnant .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite describe the early evolution when the supernova ejecta are in free expansion .",
    "later , after the remnant interior is heated by the passage of the reverse shock , the pwn evolves within the sedov phase supernova remnant whose radius is @xmath57 for an explosion energy @xmath58 in a @xmath59 medium of density @xmath60 .",
    "psr b1706@xmath044 has a characteristic age @xmath61yr with @xmath62 , so g343.1@xmath02.3 should be safely in the sedov phase with an expected angular size @xmath63 for a supernova releasing energy @xmath64 in an external medium density @xmath65 , at a true age @xmath66y at a distance @xmath67kpc .",
    "the observed size then implies @xmath68 , requiring a fairly energetic explosion for @xmath69kpc . during the sedov phase the interior pressure is @xmath70 and is relatively constant away from the snr limb .",
    "the pulsar blows a wind bubble within this snr interior , whose radius is @xmath71 for a pwn bubble energy @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "although the accuracy of this dependence of pwn radius on pulsar injection energy has been questioned @xcite , we adopt it for the following estimates . with the observed ratio of radii , @xmath73",
    ", we obtain @xmath74 , i.e. this pwn has quite low internal energy .",
    "this is also reflected in the low radio and x - ray fluxes .",
    "together we use these estimates , the observed size of the snr , equation ( 1 ) and the measured @xmath75 and @xmath76y to write @xmath77 . now , if the pwn is adiabatic and we assume spindown with constant @xmath78 and braking index @xmath79 from an initial period @xmath80 , we find that the total energy in the plerion is @xmath81 { \\dot e } \\tau_c$ ] . then , setting @xmath82 and eliminating the true age @xmath83 using @xmath84 $ ] for magnetic dipole spindown , we obtain a constraint on the initial spin period @xmath85 ^ 3/(p_0/p)^2 = 0.68\\ , n_0 d_3 ^ 5 \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] which has a solution of @xmath86ms for d=3kpc , and @xmath87ms for d=2kpc .",
    "the corresponding true ages are 0.61@xmath88 ( @xmath89y ) and 0.38@xmath88 ( @xmath90y ) , respectively .",
    "these numerical values are for @xmath91 and the density dependence from equation ( 3 ) is quite weak .",
    "@xcite present a similar sum for @xmath80 , assuming a known @xmath58 ; the above formulation emphasizes the sensitivity to the poorly known @xmath92 .",
    "note that with the large implied initial period , the integrated pwn energy is quite comparable to the present spin energy , with @xmath93 at d=3kpc and @xmath94 at d=2kpc .",
    "so the spindown luminosity is roughly constant in the adiabatic phase and the pwn growth is closer to @xmath95 than to the @xmath96 law appropriate for impulsive energy injection @xcite .    inside this wind bubble , the sedov interior pressure confines the pwn , giving rise to a termination shock at @xmath97 which results in @xmath98 .",
    "if we apply the snr estimate for @xmath58 above , this becomes @xmath99 .",
    "then , using @xmath100 and applying the age estimate following equation ( 3 ) we get @xmath101 ( d=3kpc ) or @xmath102 ( d=2kpc ) .",
    "these estimates are reasonably consistent with the observed @xmath103 torus radius , especially since an equatorially concentrated flow should have a stand - off distance 1.5 - 2@xmath104 this spherical scale .",
    "the polar jets can have an initial shock at somewhat larger angle , with the resulting pitch angle scattering illuminating the jets somewhat further from the pulsar .",
    "of course , this bubble is offset from the center of g343.1@xmath02.3 at @xmath105 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this is inside the @xmath106 where @xcite note that the increasing density causes the pulsar to be supersonic , so a bow shock should not have yet formed .",
    "these authors however compute numerical models of a fast moving pulsar in a snr interior . as the pulsar moves",
    ", the pwn should become highly asymmetric with a ` relic pwn ' at the snr center and the pulsar placed near the leading edge of the pwn ; see @xcite figures 7 and 8 .",
    "we see no pwn structure near the geometric center of g343.1@xmath02.3 and , if the ` bubble nebula ' is identified with the shocked pulsar wind , the pulsar is certainly not offset from its center along the proper motion axis ( away from the snr center ) .",
    "so these models are an inadequate description of g343.1@xmath02.3 . from figure 2 ,",
    "the pulsar is well centered in the bubble nebula , with any offset from its center along the axis to the snr substantially less than @xmath107arcsec .",
    "thus @xmath108 and the pulsar can not have moved far from the explosion center .",
    "this is , of course , consistent with the scintillation results .",
    "we can reconcile the symmetric pwn with the offset snr shell if we assume that the pulsar progenitor exploded toward the edge of a quasi - spherical cavity .",
    "one scenario ( also posited by gvaramadze 2002 , bock & gvaramadze 2002 ) that can associate the low velocity pulsar with g343.1@xmath02.3 is to assume that the progenitor star had a stellar wind of mass loss rate @xmath109/yr and wind speed @xmath110cm / s over @xmath111y , typical of the @xmath112 stars that dominate the pulsar progenitors @xcite .",
    "this evacuates a stellar wind bubble of size @xmath113 during the main sequence lifetime , the star moving at @xmath114km / s travels @xmath115 and so it can easily traverse its wind bubble .",
    "thus , one can imagine an off - center supernova in a nearly symmetric stellar wind bubble of radius @xmath116 : the supernova blast wave expands to fill the bubble , passing to the sedov phase near its present radius .",
    "the supernova produces a neutron star with little or no kick , placing the pulsar near its present position .",
    "this has the added advantage of accommodating the rather large snr size with a more modest energy of a few@xmath117erg .",
    "the pwn energy and size estimates above would then be somewhat amended ; this would require a careful numerical simulation .",
    "for the reasons detailed in the introduction , it is not yet clear that psr b1706@xmath044 and g343.1@xmath02.3 are associated .",
    "so for completeness we can consider the case when the shocked pulsar wind blows an adiabatic bubble in a static , low @xmath118 external medium @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the pulsar was born ( sans snr ) or entered a confining region of the ism @xmath119y ago and that since then it has been spinning down at the present energy loss rate , we find that it will blow a bubble of angular size @xmath120 these estimates change somewhat for a pulsar born at @xmath121 ; since we are not making the association with the snr g343.1@xmath02.3 , we can make no estimate of the initial spin period . as first noted by @xcite , the @xmath122 wide radio spur across the face of g343.1@xmath02.3",
    "has the approximate scale of such a ` bubble nebula ' .",
    "if the pwn stays unmixed ( relativistic ) then the interior of the bubble will have a pressure @xmath123 . in turn , the torus termination shock in this medium is at @xmath124 if ( e.g. through rayleigh - taylor instabilities ) the pulsar wind is well mixed with the swept up gas , the adiabatic thermal pressure would be @xmath125 larger .",
    "interestingly , the angular scales for this scenario are also reasonably compatible with the observed torus and bubble nebula size .",
    "of course this scenario leaves open the question of the pulsar origin .",
    "again the pulsar would need to have a quite low velocity to produced the observed symmetry .    turning to the spectral results , we note that @xcite fit a correlation between spindown energy and the psr+pwn luminosity : @xmath126 .",
    "for the psr b1706@xmath044 parameters this predicts a flux @xmath127 .",
    "the observed 2 - 10kev flux is in fact @xmath128 , even including the outer ` bubble nebula ' ; without this component it is half as large .",
    "these correlations are not very accurate , but this does imply that the psr b1706@xmath044 pwn is substantially under - luminous for any distance less than 3kpc .",
    "@xcite has derived correlations between the pulsar spindown power and the pulsar / pwn spectral indices .",
    "his relation predicts @xmath129 ( substantially smaller than our power law index @xmath130 ) and @xmath131 ( not inconsistent with the values measured for the torus and equatorial pwn ) .",
    "as described in  2.4 , the spectrum softens appreciably from the central torus to the outer bubble nebula .",
    "this suggests increased aging of the synchrotron population .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show that the bulk of the radio emission lies in the ` bubble nebula ' region .",
    "so we can take the radio flux and spectral index from @xcite and compare with our nebula x - ray flux ( fig .",
    "4 ) . comparing the radio spectral index",
    "@xmath132 with the best fit x - ray index @xmath133 , shows a break quite close to the @xmath134 expected from synchrotron cooling .",
    "the extrapolated intersection of these power laws gives a break frequency of log[@xmath135=12.2^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ ] .",
    "for the fiducial pulsar age of @xmath136y , this corresponds to a nebula field of @xmath137 g .",
    "note that the magnetic pressure from this ( photon flux - weighted ) average field is @xmath138 , somewhat larger than the nebula pressure estimated from its radius .",
    "this may indicate field compression in the nebula limb .",
    "in general , if the mean nebula field is @xmath139 g for a nebula of angular radius @xmath140 , the total nebula field energy is @xmath141erg .",
    "this is comfortably less than the present spin energy @xmath142erg , so the nebula can be easily powered even if the pulsar was born close to its present spin period .",
    "we find that this cooling break field is substantially larger than the equipartition field of @xmath143 g inferred for the radio and x - ray emitting populations ( also the minimum equipartition nebula energy @xmath144erg is substantially smaller ) .",
    "the cooling break field can also be compared to that expected from simple radial evolution of the pulsar surface field : if this field @xmath145 g falls off as @xmath146 to the light cylinder , then as @xmath147 to the wind shock where it is compressed we get @xmath148 mg . if it continues to fall off as @xmath147 beyond this we get a field at the limb of the bubble nebula of @xmath149 g .",
    "so the best we can do is to infer a mean nebular field @xmath150 the equipartition value , with some generation of new field beyond the torus wind shock .",
    "the energetic requirements for this field , required to match the @xmath151 cooling break , are comfortably less than the energy available from psr b1706@xmath044 .",
    "these field estimates are consistent with the non - detection of tev ics flux from this source @xcite .",
    "the narrow outer jets also have a power - law spectrum and are almost certainly synchrotron - emitting . for a reasonable @xmath153 mg field ,",
    "the observed x - rays of @xmath154kev require substantial @xmath155 energies , with @xmath156 near the radiation - reaction limited primary lorentz factor inferred for many polar cap @xcite and outer magnetosphere @xcite pulsar models .",
    "since the jet is narrow , confinement of these pairs imposes a ( not very restrictive ) lower bound on the jet field @xmath157 where the maximum observed jet photon has @xmath158kev and the observed outer jet half - width is @xmath159arcsec .",
    "a more restrictive upper limit on the mean jet field comes from the observation that the jets do not soften noticeably before their end @xmath160arcsec from the pulsar .",
    "if we assume a jet bulk speed @xmath161c , then arguing that the flow time is shorter than the synchrotron cooling time gives us the limit @xmath162    when the observed jet spectrum has an energy index of @xmath163 , we infer a power - law spectrum of @xmath155 in the jet @xmath164 , with @xmath165 .",
    "we can then make an estimate of the minimum jet luminosity , i.e. at ` equipartition ' when @xmath166 .",
    "given the observed combined outer jet luminosity ( 0.5 - 8kev ) @xmath167 and emitting volume @xmath168 with the angles in arcsec , we can estimate the equipartition field for an isotropic plasma as @xmath169^{2/7 } \\eqno ( 9)\\ ] ] where the observed photon spectrum runs from @xmath170 to @xmath171 .",
    "for the observed flux this gives @xmath172^{-2/7}\\ , { \\rm g } , \\eqno ( 10)\\ ] ] where @xmath173 is a weak function of @xmath174 .",
    "the corresponding minimum energy flux for the outer jet is @xmath175 where the jet bulk velocity is @xmath161c .",
    "this is @xmath176 per jet and will , of course , be larger if the jet flow includes ions . interestingly ,",
    "if the pulsar couples roughly isotropically to the pwn , then the corresponding fraction of the outflow should subtend a half angle of @xmath177 .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the angle subtended by the inner jets , but @xmath42 larger than the @xmath178 width of the ends of the jet ",
    "there is substantial collimation of the jet energy flux .",
    "we have argued that a low psr velocity can explain the symmetry of the pwn .",
    "the central location of the pulsar and spherical post - shock flow may also allow the equatorial toroidal structure and polar jets to propagate undisturbed to large radii .",
    "we do , however , measure a small misalignment of the outer jets , corresponding to a deflection of @xmath179 for each .",
    "if we imagine a pressure acting along the jet s @xmath38 length , then the required perturbation is @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the jet s cross sectional area .",
    "this is only @xmath182 of the total pressure in the nebula",
    ". it could be due to ram pressure if the shocked nebular medium flows to the west at @xmath183km / s .",
    "our x - ray measurements have established the pwn symmetry axis , presumably reflecting the pulsar spin axis , to very high precision .",
    "unfortunately our original goal of relating this to the proper motion axis remains unfulfilled .",
    "it is true that the torus symmetry axis points roughly toward the center of g343.1@xmath02.3 , confirming the estimates from earlier _ chandra _ data .",
    "however , the pwn symmetry about the pulsar and the low scintillation velocity suggest a very low transverse speed @xmath184km / s , which would preclude a birth site as distant as the snr center .",
    "this low speed makes a direct proper motion challenging , but allows latitudinal asymmetries in the pwn flow to propagate undisturbed to fairly large radius , where they can be imaged with _",
    "thus , study of this pwn offers some good opportunities to probe outflow dynamics and jet collimation .",
    "study of this , and similar , pwne may prove useful electrodynamic analogs of the @xmath185 more powerful agn jets . a viable scenario for maintaining the g343.1@xmath02.3/psr b1706@xmath044 association posits a supernova event near the present pulsar site , with the remnant inflating a pre - existing off - center cavity .",
    "however , the residual ( small ) proper motion could then have any direction .",
    "in fact , the faint extension of the pwn ( bubble nebula ) to the west and the increased radio surface brightness to the east might suggest a rather slow pulsar motion at pa @xmath186",
    ". this would be nearly orthogonal to the torus symmetry axis . with the large @xmath80 estimated here , this",
    "could be construed as suggesting poor rotational averaging of a birth kick @xcite .",
    "so the pwn / snr geometry offers both aligned and orthogonal axes .",
    "only a sensitive astrometric campaign can detect or limit the pulsar motion and resolve this ambiguity .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa grants sao g04 - 5060x and nag5 - 13344 .",
