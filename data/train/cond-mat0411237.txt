    "over the years the non - linear , dynamical properties of squid rings ( i.e. thick superconducting rings containing either one or two josephson weak link devices ) have formed the basis of a range of technologically important devices  @xcite , most recently through the phenomenon of stochastic resonance  @xcite .",
    "apart from these applications , the study of the physics of the squid rings themselves  @xcite has added considerably to the general field of non - linear dynamics . as studied previously , these dynamical properties have been due to the quasi - classical behaviour of squid rings in the regime where quantum processes can be neglected",
    ". however , of late much interest has been shown in the use of squid rings as purely quantum devices in possible quantum technologies  @xcite .",
    "this interest has been encouraged by recent experimental work on superposition states in weak link circuits  @xcite and , in particular , on squid rings  @xcite .",
    "inevitably , at some stage , quantum circuits are required to interact with classical probe circuits if information about their quantum state / evolution is to be extracted .",
    "as we have shown , for the case of the squid ring this interaction leads to the growth of non - linear behaviour in the classical part of the system  @xcite .",
    "thus , from this perspective , non - linear dynamics always has a crucial role to play in the description , quantum or quasi - classical , of squid rings . in this paper",
    "we shall demonstrate that , even with the quite understandable attention being paid to squid rings at the quantum level , there is much still to be explored in the quasi - classical regime .",
    "this can add greatly to our knowledge of non - linear systems and could lead to novel and powerful applications .    in the description of squid rings  @xcite",
    "it is customary ( from this quasi - classical viewpoint ) to identify regimes of behaviour in terms of the parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the ring inductance , @xmath2 is the ( josephson ) critical current of the weak link in the ring and @xmath3 . in the presence of an external magnetic flux",
    "@xmath4 the response of a squid ring is to set up a screening supercurrent @xmath5 .",
    "the functional form of @xmath6 depends on the value of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , for @xmath8 , @xmath9 is always single valued in @xmath4 while for @xmath10 this current is multi - valued and hysteretic in @xmath4 . in this latter regime @xmath5",
    "can be viewed as a set of approximately diamagnetic branches with switching between adjacent branches ( in the absence of noise ) occurring when @xmath11 reaches @xmath12 .",
    "given this branch switching , hysteresis loops will be swept out , with concomitant dissipation , when @xmath9 exceeds @xmath12 . devices which utilize the properties of single weak link squid rings , such as magnetometers  @xcite , are usually operated at low @xmath13 values ( e.g.  2 to  5 ) . in operation as magnetometers single weak link squid rings are typically coupled inductively to a radio frequency ( rf @xmath14 20mhz ) , parallel lc , tank circuit which is excited using an rf current source .",
    "this arrangement is shown schematically in figure  1 .",
    "as is well known , the rf voltage developed across the tank circuit is a function of both the rf magnetic flux amplitude and the static magnetic flux @xmath15 applied to the ring .",
    "this static flux dependence is periodic in @xmath16 , hence the use of the squid ring - tank circuit system in magnetometry .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of a squid ring coupled to an external resonant circuit is governed , ultimately , by the form of its potential @xmath17 .",
    "quasi - classically  @xcite ( i.e. when the effective mass of the ring - the weak link capacitance @xmath18 - is large , typically @xmath19 to @xmath20f for 4 kelvin operation ) this potential has the form    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the total included flux in the ring . clearly , if @xmath23 changes slowly with time ( i.e. slowly compared with any ring time constants ) , the ring will always remain at , or very close to , the minimum in @xmath24 . in dealing with ring - resonator dynamics",
    "it has been customary to assume that this adiabatic constraint is satisfied , e.g. in the low @xmath25 rf squid magnetometer where the peak rf flux at the ring typically @xmath26 @xmath27 ( @xmath28 for a fraction @xmath29 of the tank circuit flux @xmath30 coupled to the ring ) .",
    "the current @xmath9 set up in response to this flux then couples back to the tank circuit , and so on .",
    "this back reaction , which reflects @xmath31 , affects the rf voltage @xmath32 of the tank circuit in a non - linear way . with @xmath33",
    "linearly amplitude modulated in time ( e.g. at @xmath14 100hz ) , the result is the rf squid magnetometer @xmath34 characteristics . following an initial linear riser in @xmath35 versus @xmath33 , these characteristics consist of a set of voltage plateaux ( steps ) spaced at regular intervals along @xmath33 , with period @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath16-periodic modulation of these step features by a static ( or quasi - static ) applied flux @xmath37 forms the basis of the rf squid magnetometer .",
    "in this paper we report on the experimental and theoretical investigation of single weak link squid rings in the so - termed very strongly hysteretic regime , a previously little explored part of the parameter space of squid behaviour . with the squid ring",
    "inductively coupled to a high quality factor @xmath38 radio frequency @xmath39 resonant circuit , we show that quite remarkable non - linear phenomena ( large amplitude relaxation oscillations ) can develop .",
    "we demonstrate that exactly these dynamics are solutions of the coupled non - linear equations of motion of the system .",
    "the quasi - classical description of the ring - tank circuit system is based on the resistively shunted junction plus capacitance ( rsj+c ) model of a weak link . here , the supercurrent channel through the link is in parallel with a normal current channel ( resistance @xmath40 ) and a capacitance @xmath41 . in the model",
    "the normal channel turns on when the link current @xmath42 . with representative values of @xmath41 from @xmath19 to @xmath43f ,",
    "generally accepted resistances @xmath40 are in the @xmath44 to @xmath45 range  @xcite . with this in mind , the coupled ring - tank circuit equations of motion are  @xcite    @xmath46    @xmath47    for tank circuit capacitance , inductance and parallel resonance resistance @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , coupling constant @xmath51 for mutual inductance @xmath52 , and josephson current @xmath53 .",
    "it is apparent in ( [ squidmot ] ) that there are several possible ring time constants @xmath54 .",
    "clearly , if the adiabatic constraint holds , and there are no time constant problems , the derivative terms in ( [ squidmot ] ) can be neglected and ( [ squidmot ] ) reduces to    @xmath55    in the past this , together with ( [ squidmot ] ) , has been the starting point of most dynamical descriptions of ring - tank circuit systems , at least for low @xmath25 squid rings .",
    "we note that in this linearized , small @xmath25 , description @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath25 ) can be found from the point of onset in @xmath33 of the periodic step features in @xmath32 versus @xmath33 ( the breakpoint ) beyond the initial linear riser  @xcite .    as we emphasized recently  @xcite , the adiabatic constraint breaks down when the ring is strongly hysteretic and underdamped  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , at 4 kelvin , transition widths for branch switchings in @xmath5 are typically @xmath56 . at 20mhz , and at the rf drive levels used experimentally for a @xmath57 ring ( @xmath58 ) , the available time to switch between branches @xmath59secs , comparable to the shortest ring time constant . in this range of @xmath60 novel multiple level structures",
    "develop in the experimental @xmath32 versus @xmath33 characteristics  @xcite .",
    "these structures ( plateaux of almost constant @xmath32 along @xmath33 ) are on a scale in @xmath33 large compared with standard rf squid magnetometer steps .",
    "however , these still maintain a form of @xmath16-periodicity in @xmath37 .",
    "we also demonstrated numerically that these multiple level structure characteristics formed a new and particular class of solutions of ( [ squidmot ] ) and ( [ tankmot ] ) .",
    "given the range of non - linear phenomena that have already been recognized in ring - tank circuit systems , it would be surprising if these multiple level structures constituted the only new class of solutions in the high @xmath25 regime . at",
    "even higher @xmath25 a second type of non - linear dynamics ( also a solution of [ squidmot ] and ( [ tankmot ] ) develops - relaxation oscillations in rf voltage against current - on scales very large @xmath61 compared with conventional squid magnetometer characteristics .      in our experiments we made use of zimmerman , 2-hole , niobium point contact squid rings  @xcite .",
    "the point contact weak links in these rings were adjusted , in situ , at liquid helium temperatures  @xcite , a technique which allows us to make weak links in a controlled way over a very wide range of @xmath25 values @xmath64 . in our experimental arrangement",
    "the tank circuit voltage @xmath32 ( figure  1 ) was first amplified by a liquid helium cooled gaasfet preamplifier ( gain @xmath65 20db , noise temperature @xmath66 10 kelvin ) .",
    "this signal was further boosted using a receiver of our own design and then diode detected .",
    "overall , the receiver system ( including the gaasfet preamplifier ) was designed to combine very low noise with very large dynamic range and slew rate , all three properties being required to observe the very strongly hysteretic behaviour reported here .    in figure",
    "2 we show a perfectly typical experimental diode detected @xmath32 versus @xmath33 squid magnetometer characteristic in this very strongly hysteretic regime .",
    "this was taken at 4.2 kelvin , in a bandwidth of @xmath67mhz , with @xmath68 , @xmath69 and a static bias flux @xmath70 , @xmath71 integer , supplied by a second coil coupled to the ring ( figure  1 ) . here ,",
    "adopting common practice , this characteristic was recorded at the @xmath72 bias frequency @xmath73 ( @xmath74mhz in this case ) equal to the resonant frequency of the ring - tank circuit system when @xmath75 . as is standard for these dynamical ( squid magnetometer ) characteristics ,",
    "the rf is amplitude modulated using a low frequency triangular ramp . in this example",
    "the ramp frequency is @xmath76hz . as can be seen , the characteristic consists of a first feature , a flat step , followed by two further step features in which it is apparent that @xmath32 oscillates very rapidly as @xmath33 increases . although not shown in figure  2 , these oscillatory step structures , periodic in @xmath33 , continued to repeat as @xmath33 was made larger .",
    "the rf voltage and current scales in figure  2 are made clear by the small , subsidiary characteristic in the same figure .",
    "this was taken at 4.2 kelvin , with @xmath77 , using the squid ring and tank circuit of the main characteristic but with the weak link in the ring adjusted to give a @xmath25 just greater than unity , i.e. the regular rf squid magnetometer regime .",
    "it is obvious that the scalings of the main characteristic are very large indeed compared to those for a standard squid magnetometer . in figure",
    "3 we show details of the second step structure of figure  2 along which the large scale oscillations first appear . here , we have expanded the first section of this step structure ( shown boxed in figure  3 ) . in the expanded picture",
    "it is apparent that @xmath32 is undergoing rapid oscillations as @xmath33 is increased .",
    "furthermore , the spacing in @xmath33 between adjacent oscillations decreases monotonically as @xmath33 is swept across the step ; this continues right across the step ( not shown in figure  3 ) .",
    "we note that the effect of a bias flux @xmath78 on these oscillatory step structures was minimal , only changing the amplitude of the oscillations very weakly , with a periodicity of @xmath16 .",
    "experimentally , a search of the first ( flat ) step in figure  1 did not reveal any voltage oscillations , only noise .",
    "again , the effect of @xmath37 was found to be negligible .",
    "the waveform of figure  3 reflects a limit cycle consisting of a very slow build up ( at least on the time scale of one rf oscillation @xmath79 ) followed by an extremely fast discharge with energy drawn from the tank circuit .",
    "this is the followed by the next slow build up with energy supplied from the rf current source over many rf periods , and so on.these are , of course , relaxation oscillations which can be found in many physical situations where non - linear dynamics is involved  @xcite . for the particular case of the driven squid ring - tank circuit system of figure  3 , the peak rf amplitude is increasing ( linearly ramped with time ) from left to right .",
    "since the energy is made up from the rf current drive , this means that the time interval between successive oscillations shortens as @xmath33 increases , as is apparent in figure  3 .    without the combination of very low noise receiver ( including a liquid helium cooled gaasfet preamplifier stage ) and very large dynamic range / slew rate capability ,",
    "the relaxation oscillations shown in figures  2 and  3 would not be observed .",
    "for example , reduced bandwidth or added noise , or a combination of both , can wash out these oscillations .",
    "what then remain are large ( compared with ordinary squid magnetometer characteristics - see insert figure  2 ) , roughly constant rf voltage , current steps .",
    "this is presumably why these dynamics have not been observed in the past .",
    "it is interesting to note that the relaxation oscillations observed by us in coupled squid ring - tank circuit systems in the very strongly hysteretic regime appear to have analogues in the phase slippage experiments which have been performed on superfluid helium systems  @xcite .",
    "it seems clear that , putting the fundamental description of superfluid and superconducting condensates aside , the phase / flux slippage in the two systems is analogous . at a phenomenological level",
    "this means that the equations of motion governing the dynamics of the two ring - resonator systems are also analogous . in the highly hysteretic regime for phase slippage in superfluid rings containing weak link orifices",
    "we would therefore expect to see ( giant ) relaxation oscillation phenomena and , perhaps , multilevel dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath62 versus @xmath63 characteristics of figures  1 and  2 can be modelled using ( [ squidmot ] ) and ( [ tankmot ] ) which can handle the problem of non - adiabaticity perfectly well  @xcite .",
    "however , since for typical squid ring parameters ( @xmath80f , @xmath81h , @xmath82 ) , the ring time constants will be 2 or more orders of magnitude shorter than the tank circuit time constant @xmath83 , great care must be taken to ensure that accurate solutions are found .",
    "to solve ( [ squidmot ] ) and ( [ tankmot ] ) we used fourth order runge - kutta with an adaptive step size algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we were also careful allow a sufficient number of steps per rf cycle to follow the changes in the squid ring accurately .",
    "for our comparison with experiment we set the rf drive frequency at the @xmath84 resonant frequency ( the pseudoresonant frequency  @xcite ) . at this",
    "bias flux the ring is at its most diamagnetic [ with a ring magnetic susceptibility @xmath85 and @xmath9 is almost linear in @xmath4 . from the data of figure  2 we can make an estimate of @xmath2 ( and hence @xmath60 ) from the start of the step features in the standard squid magnetometer compared with the ( first ) step feature in the large scale characteristics  @xcite",
    "this yields an @xmath2 for the large @xmath60 characteristic @xmath86a ( i.e. a @xmath25 value in the 70 to 80 range ) .",
    "we have shown  @xcite that knowing @xmath2 and the fermi velocity of the material of the squid ring ( here niobium ) we can estimate @xmath18 . for @xmath87a",
    "this gives @xmath88 few@xmath89f .",
    "in addition , from singly connected current - voltage characteristics for point contact weak links@xmath90 , a typical value for @xmath40 at this @xmath2 is @xmath91 .    in figure  4",
    "we show the results of solving ( [ squidmot ] ) and ( [ tankmot ] ) to simulate the behaviour of the ring - tank circuit system of figures  2 and  3 , including a 4 kelvin noise source  @xcite .",
    "given the very non - linear nature of this coupled system , and the number of parameters involved , an exact match between theory and experiment has proved difficult .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to reproduce the important features of the integer bias flux @xmath32 versus @xmath33 characteristic of figures  2 and  3 with @xmath92a and best fit values @xmath93f , @xmath94 and @xmath95mhz . the other circuit parameters are , as for figures  2 and  3 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath96h , while the effective triangular ramp frequency ( converted from an rf current ramp in @xmath97 ) is close to @xmath98hz .",
    "as can be seen , the computed solution contains both the first flat step and the relaxation oscillations on the second ( and subsequent ) step features of figure  2 .",
    "details of these ( computed ) oscillations are shown in the lower inset in figure  4 .",
    "also shown inset , over a small range of @xmath63 in the same figure , is a highly expanded section of the first flat step .",
    "this too displays ( weak ) voltage oscillations which appear to be either aperiodic or multiperiodic .",
    "these oscillations were not seen experimentally , presumably because of limited signal to noise .",
    "if @xmath33 is fixed in the regions corresponding to the insets in figure  4 - for the experimental data set of figure  2 , and time series data are collected , these weak oscillations can be seen reflected in the ( pseudo ) phase portrait , as shown in figure  5(a ) . here",
    ", the pseudo - phase portrait is defined as a plot of @xmath99 against the time shifted @xmath100 at all times @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is a suitable time delay @xmath103 . in the main part of figure  5(a ) we show the pseudo phase portrait , taken over a set of complete orbits , for the bias point in the upper inset . in the lower inset we display just one of these orbits .",
    "it is clear , for the first step , that this pseudo - phase portrait simply shows random fluctuations ( noise ) superimposed on a singly periodic orbit .",
    "this should be contrasted with the pseudo - phase portrait of figure  5(b ) for @xmath33 biased onto the middle of the relaxation oscillations in the second @xmath32 versus @xmath33 step feature [ shown in the upper inset of figure  5(b ) ] . here",
    ", we have again plotted a set of orbits , with a single orbit of this set shown in the lower inset . as is apparent both the set and the single orbit display the periodic behaviour associated with the relaxation oscillations on the step .",
    "what the theoretical computations of figure  4 , the experimental data of figures  2 and  3 , and the previously published multilevel structures  @xcite , demonstrate is that the form of the solutions to the coupled equations of motion ( [ squidmot ] ) and ( [ tankmot ] ) is critically dependent on parameter values .",
    "more specifically , it appears that in the very strongly hysteretic regime and above ( i.e. @xmath104 ) the underdamping in the ring - tank circuit system becomes sufficiently large to wash out multilevel structures completely , or almost completely .",
    "physically , these structures arise ( with stochastic jumping ) from the system moving around @xmath71 hysteresis loops in @xmath105 versus @xmath4 ( or @xmath9 versus @xmath106 ) in @xmath107 rf cycles , @xmath71 and @xmath107 integer  @xcite .",
    "when sufficiently underdamped we assume that the system simply jumps between much larger values of @xmath105 in @xmath108 versus @xmath23 , followed by long recovery period over many rf cycles , i.e. a relaxation oscillation process .",
    "the experimental data of figures  2 and  3 are typical of the @xmath32 versus @xmath33 characteristics found in the very strongly hysteretic , and underdamped , regime @xmath109 .",
    "these data can be modelled with considerable accuracy invoking the squid potential  ( [ squidpot ] ) and using the quasi - classical equations of motion  ( [ squidmot ] ) and ( [ tankmot ] ) , as can be seen from the computed @xmath32 versus @xmath33 characteristics of figure  4 .",
    "thus , from experiment and theory we find that there exists another class of solution , to the dynamics of the driven ring - tank circuit system in the very highly hysteretic regime , apart from multilevel structures  @xcite .",
    "since these ( latter ) structures clearly hold out the real possibility of quasi - classical multilevel logic and memory if these dynamics are well understood and can be controlled , there is every reason for opening up the phase space of behaviour . indeed , the potential for single flux quantum logic has already attracted a great deal of interest  @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable , therefore , that multilevel logic based on the manipulation of sets of discrete flux states of a squid ring in the strongly hysteretic regime will also generate interest . from the work reported here , it would appear that the change over between multilevel and relaxation solutions is quite subtle and sensitive to circuit parameters . from experiment and theory",
    "we find that relaxation oscillation characteristics , very similar to those reported here , carry on to very much higher @xmath13 values @xmath110 .",
    "this , of course , points to these being a rather general class of solutions to ( [ squidmot ] ) and ( [ tankmot ] ) .",
    "again , as with the earlier multilevel structures  @xcite , these solutions do not arise in the linearized description of the system .",
    "we note , again from experiment and computation , that the multi - level structures  @xcite found in the strongly hysteretic regime with @xmath111 gradually fade away as @xmath25 increases , to be replaced by the relaxation oscillation characteristics reported in this paper . in our opinion , even though other factors may be important in governing the already underdamped dynamics of this highly non - linear system , this points to the damping becoming weaker as @xmath25 grows .",
    "it also seems clear that a rich new field of non - linear dynamics exist which , as yet , has only been partially explored . from a historical perspective , it is also of interest that the original description of rf - biased squid magnetometers  @xcite was based on a relaxation oscillation model , albeit operating over very much shorter time intervals ( a few rf periods ) , and on the rf voltage and current scales of conventional squid magnetometers  @xcite .",
    "never the less , relaxation oscillations have not been seen in the dynamics of these standard magnetometers . to our best knowledge ,",
    "the relaxation oscillations reported in this paper are the first to have been observed in the dynamical ( @xmath32 versus @xmath33 ) characteristics of squid ring - resonator systems on any scale or frequency .",
    "we would to express our thanks to the engineering and physical sciences research council for its generous funding of this work ."
