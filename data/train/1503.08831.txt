    "* ) is dominated by the addition of recently - quenched star - forming galaxies , and at @xmath9 the massive galaxy population grows primarily by the assembly of existing quiescent galaxies . @xcite obtain qualitatively similar results for the most massive galaxies by tracing progenitors at fixed number density ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "based on comparison with the mock main - sequence sfhs , a @xmath67 gyr spread in formation times is required to explain both the relatively old ages found for quiescent galaxies already at @xmath68 as well as the ages measured at @xmath69 , but is nonetheless consistent with the small scatter observed locally among red - sequence galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : ms_evo ] we show the implied mass growth for these models as a function of star - formation timescale , in this case defined as the time galaxies spend on the main sequence starting from an initial mass of @xmath72 .    the chemical abundance patterns of local ellipticals suggest that they form on relatively short timescales , @xmath73  gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "on the other hand , the rapid evolution of ssfr @xmath74 at @xmath75 ( equation [ ssfr ] ) leads to a dramatic increase in the formation time of massive galaxies on the main sequence , so that by @xmath76 the typical timescale is a factor of @xmath112 longer than that inferred from the @xmath13-element abundances of local early - types .",
    "it is important to note that this comparison neglects the role of mergers : @xcite show that massive galaxies can accrete @xmath1150% of their final stellar mass from @xmath77 to 0 .",
