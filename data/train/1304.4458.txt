    "( [ power : jpsipi ] ) and ( [ power : hcpi ] ) , it can be concluded that the contributions of the coupled - channel effects would be significant here since the amplitudes scale as @xmath127 . and",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath128 is expected to be larger than that of @xmath129 , because the corresponding amplitudes scale as @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "however , the momentum @xmath126 in @xmath132 is larger than that in @xmath133 , which may compensate this discrepancy to some extent .",
    "since there are no experimental data for the hidden - charmonium decays of @xmath12 and @xmath21 , we can not determine the cutoff parameter @xmath8 for each channels .",
    "however , due the similarity to the hidden - bottom decays of @xmath41 , it is also possible to find an appropriate range of @xmath8 values for each decay channels that can account for the data via the intermediate charmed meson loops  @xcite . and",

    "the intermediate d - meson loop effects turn out to be more important in @xmath135 than in @xmath86 .",
    "this is understandable since the mass of @xmath72 is closer to the thresholds of @xmath111 or @xmath112 than @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "thus , it gives rise to important threshold effects in @xmath135 .",
    "one also notices that the @xmath8-dependence of the branching ratios for @xmath135 are less sensitive than that for @xmath136 .",
    "this indicates that the enhanced branching ratios are not from the off - shell part of the loop integrals and the enhanced ( but rather stable in terms of @xmath8 ) branching ratios for @xmath135 suggest that more stringent dynamic constraints are presumably needed to describe the near - threshold phenomena where the local quark - hadron duality has been apparently violated . what makes this process different from e.g. @xmath137 in ref .",
    "@xcite is that there is no cancelations between the charged and neutral meson loops . as a consequence , the subleading terms in refs .",
    "@xcite become actually leading contributions . in fig .",

    ", we can see that the intermediate meson loop contributions are more important in @xmath139 than that in @xmath138",
    ".    it would be interesting to further clarify the uncertainties arising from the introduction of form factors by studying the @xmath8 dependence of the ratios between different partial decay widths .",
    "for the decays of @xmath140 , we define the following ratios to the partial decay widths of @xmath141 : @xmath142 which are plotted in fig .  [ fig : ratio ] .",
    "the ratios are relatively insensitive to the cutoff parameter , which is because the involved loops are the same .",
    "since the first coupling vertices are the same for those decay channels when taking the ratio , also the mass of @xmath72 is closer to @xmath143 thresholds than @xmath71 , so the ratio only reflects the open threshold effects via the intermediate charmed meson loops .",
    "the future experimental measurements of @xmath144 and @xmath87 can help us investigate this issue deeply .    in order to understand this ,",
    "the following analysis is carried out .",
    "first , one notices that we have adopted the couplings for the @xmath73 and @xmath145 to @xmath146 or @xmath147 in the heavy quark approximation .",
    "since the physical masses for @xmath74 and @xmath75 are adopted in the loop integrals , the form factor will introduce unphysical pole contributions of which the interferences with the nearby physical poles would lead to model - dependent uncertainties . by assuming @xmath148 mev and @xmath149 mev , namely , by making the spin symmetry exactly",
    ", we calculate the branching ratios of @xmath109 and @xmath150 , @xmath87 and @xmath151 .",
    "we expect that the exact spin symmetry will significantly lower the branching ratios since there will be only one physical pole in the loop and the unphysical one can be easily isolated away from the physical one .",
    "this is a rather direct demonstration of the sensitivity of the meson loop behavior when close to open threshold and when the dispersive part becomes dominant .    as a cross - check",
    ", we also calculate the branching ratios of the decays in the framework of nreft and the relevant transition amplitudes are given in appendix  [ appendix - b ] .",
    "the numerical results in nreft are listed in table .",
    "[ tab : br ] , the uncertainties are due to the experimental measured uncertainties of the total widths of @xmath12 and @xmath21 . as shown in this table , the results calculated in nreft are in good agreement with the results in ela at the commonly accepted range except for the case of @xmath86 , which indicates the availability of our model to some extent and shows that the higher order effects are important in @xmath86 .",
    "in fact , following the nreft power counting for higher loops in ref .",
    "@xcite , one sees that this is exactly the channel where higher order loops can be important .",
    "however , since there are still several uncertainties coming from the undetermined coupling constants , and the cutoff energy dependence of the amplitude is not quite stable , the numerical results would be lacking in high accuracy .",
    "especially , since the kinematics and off - shell effects arising from the exchanged particles are different , the cutoff parameter can also be different in different decay channels .",

    "our results show that the meson loop contributions are much more important when the final state mass threshold are close to the intermediate meson thresholds .",
    "namely , the effects from the unphysical pole introduced by the form factors would interfere with the nearby physical poles from the internal propagators and lead to model - dependent uncertainties .",
