    "[ sec : intro ] if @xmath0 dehn surgery on a knot @xmath1 in @xmath2 yields the lens space @xmath3 , we call the pair @xmath4 a _ lens space surgery _ , and we also say that @xmath1 admits a lens space surgery , and that @xmath0 is the _ coefficient _ of the lens space surgery . the task of classifying lens space surgeries , especially knots that admit lens space surgeries has been a focal point in low - dimensional topology . in 1990 , berge @xcite pointed out a mechanism  of known lens space surgery , that is , _ doubly - primitive knots _ in the heegaard surface of genus @xmath5 .",
    "berge also gave a conjecturally complete list of such knots , described them by osborne ",
    "stevens s r - r diagrams  in @xcite , and classified such knots into three families , and into 12 types in detail :    1 .",
    "_ knots in a solid torus ( berge  gabai knots ) _ : typei , ii , ... and vi ( berge @xcite ) + dehn surgery along a knot in a solid torus whose resulting manifold is also a solid torus .",
    "typei consists of torus knots .",
    "typeii consists of @xmath5-cable of torus knots .",
    "knots in genus - one fiber surface _ : typevii and viii ( see baker @xcite and also @xcite ) 3 .   _ sporadic examples ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) _ : typeix , x , xi and xii , respectively .",
    "their surgery coefficients are also decided .",
    "they are called _ berge s lens space surgeries_. the numbering vii  xii ( after vi ) are used by baker in @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured by gordon @xcite that every knot of lens space surgery is a doubly - primitive knot .    in the present paper , we are concerned with the minor family ( 3 ) .",
    "it is known that typeix and typexii ( berge s ( a ) and ( d ) ) are related , and that typex and typexi ( berge s ( b ) and ( c ) ) are related . thus our targets are typeix and typex .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we let type@xmath6 denote either typeix or typex , i.e. , @xmath7 ix or x. knots in type @xmath8 are parametrized by an integer @xmath9 with @xmath10 ( @xcite ) , thus we call the knots @xmath11 for typeix , and @xmath12 for typex , respectively . for the precise construction of the knots @xmath13 , see section  [ sec : sporadic ] .",
    "next , we calculate and verify that the numbers of double points of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . by lemma  [ lem : divide](2 ) , they are equal to the genus of the presented knots @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath16 is @xmath18 by lemma  [ lem : pj ] , we have :                      it is easy to see that the framed sublink of thick seven components presents @xmath2 , by usual weighted tree diagram in the right half of figure  [ fig : baker ] .",
    "we call the sublink the non - trivial diagram of @xmath2 . in the resulting @xmath2 ,",
    "the thin component is the sporadic knot @xmath13 as a knot .",
    "[ case @xmath24 ]  first , we assume that @xmath24 until the final paragraph . to get a usual diagram of the knot @xmath13 , we have to chase the thin component ( with framing ) during the deformation from the non - trivial diagram to the empty diagram of @xmath2 .",
    "it is not easy but straight forward . in the middle of the process",
    ", we reach a diagram in figure  [ fig : fromt ] , where boxed @xmath30 in the diagram means a right handed full - twist .",
    "the thin component @xmath31 is a torus knot @xmath32 with framing @xmath33 , which is a coefficient of reducible dehn surgery .",
    "we name the four component link @xmath34 , where @xmath35 the @xmath36-framed unknotted component for @xmath37 .",
    "second , we decompose the full - twist at the boxed @xmath30 as two half - twists , denoted by @xmath39 in triangles , and deform the diagram by isotopy as in figure  [ fig : fromt2 ] . note that the half - twist in the right is of @xmath40 strings .",
    "we can see that @xmath41 is strongly invertible with respect to the horizontal axis , see lemma  [ lem : divide](5 ) .      as a quotient of the involution , ignoring the crossing data ( over or under )",
    ", we have a plane curve properly immersed in the half plane .",
    "the curve can be modified as in figure  [ fig : diveo ] .",
    "this is a divide presentation of @xmath41 .",
    "it can be checked by couture ",
    "perron s method in figure  [ fig : cp ] .",
    "this process is related to the original construction of divide knots : for a link of singularity of a complex plane curve , the divide is a real part of a `` good \" perturbation ( called real morsification ) of the equation of the singularity .    in the divide presentation of @xmath41 in figure  [",
    "fig : diveo ] , a line segment @xmath42 is placed slightly different whether @xmath9 is even or odd .",
    "we name the plane curve @xmath43 , where @xmath44 presents @xmath45 by lemma  [ lem : ghy ] , since @xmath44 is a generalized l - shaped curve of type @xmath46 $ ] and is isotopic to @xmath47 .",
    "the line segments @xmath48 presents @xmath49 , respectively , as a divide presentation .",
    "from now on , we go into the second half of the proof , and study the knots and links by divide presentation .",
    "we use @xmath53-moves on divides freely , see lemma  [ lem : divide](7 ) .",
    "we have two ( or three ) steps : ( i ) blow - down along @xmath42 ( take a full - twist along @xmath54 , ( ii ) ( only if @xmath9 is odd ) modify the curve by some @xmath53-moves , and ( iii ) deform the curve by couture moves .",
    "our goal is the divide @xmath14 with edges @xmath55 , where @xmath56 ( and @xmath57 ) is a small parallel push - off of the bottom edge @xmath58 ( the left edge @xmath59 ) of the region of @xmath14 into the interior .",
    "( step ( i ) )  we take a right handed full - twist of @xmath60 along the unknot @xmath54 .",
    "we name the resulting link @xmath61 this full - twist is done as a blow - down along the line @xmath42 , i.e. , by adding a square by lemma  [ lem : adds ] . in the case where @xmath9 is even , we slide @xmath42 and @xmath62 by @xmath53-moves as the first picture in figure  [ fig : divev ] and add a square .",
    "otherwise , we add a square along the bottom edge as in figure  [ fig : divod ] .",
    "( step ( ii ) )   if @xmath9 is odd , the curve has a terminal point at the right bottom corner .",
    "we move the terminal point ( and its segment ) up along the right edge , as the second deformation of in figure  [ fig : divod ] .",
    "we also slide the other added part at the bottom to the right by some @xmath53-moves .",
    "( step ( iii ) )   the resulting curve is near l - shaped , but the lines are not in the required position .",
    "here we use couture move , see the second halves of figure  [ fig : divev ] in the case @xmath9 is even , and figure  [ fig : divod ] in the case @xmath9 is odd . by some obvious @xmath53-moves , we have the required curve @xmath64 , which presents @xmath65 as a divide link .",
    "the sublink @xmath66 is a hopf link and the framings are @xmath67 @xmath68 for typeix , or @xmath69 for typex . by the construction of @xmath15 in definition  [ def : pxj ] , and by the correspondence between adding a square to a divide and a full - twist of the divide link in lemma  [ lem : adds ] , we have the required divide presentation of @xmath13 with @xmath24 .    [ case @xmath26 ]  finally , we study the case @xmath71 .",
    "the method is similar .",
    "we define an integer @xmath72 by @xmath73 for figures . starting with baker s description in figure  [ fig : baker ]",
    ", we have a link @xmath41 in figure  [ fig : fromtn ] .",
    "divide description of @xmath41 is in figure  [ fig : diveoneg ] , contrast to figure  [ fig : diveo ] . especially , the non - trivial component @xmath44 and @xmath75 ( ex . @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) are the same curves presenting @xmath78 but the other segment components are placed differently .      in figure  [ fig : divevneg ] and [ fig : divodneg ] , we show some deformations .",
    "figures  [ fig : fromtn ] , [ fig : diveoneg ] , [ fig : divevneg ] , [ fig : divodneg ] ( case @xmath81 ) are contrast to figures  [ fig : fromt ] , [ fig : diveo ] , [ fig : divev ] , [ fig : divod ] ( case @xmath24 ) , respectively .        * proof * ( of lemma  [ lem : pj ] ) .",
    "we study a sublink @xmath84 of @xmath41 in figure  [ fig : fromt ] ( or figure  [ fig : fromtn ] , respectively ) , presented by @xmath85 in @xmath86 in figure  [ fig : diveo ] ( or figure  [ fig : diveoneg ] ) as a divide link .",
    "the component @xmath31 is a torus knot @xmath32 ( or @xmath87 ) . by the diagrams of @xmath41 in figure  [ fig : diveo ] and figure  [ fig : diveoneg ]",
    ", we can see that @xmath88 is a torus knot @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 ) , presented by @xmath14 as a divide knot . the case @xmath26 is a little harder , see lemma  [ lem : tn2n-1 ] .",
    "we have the lemma .",
    "first , assume @xmath24 .",
    "the plane curve @xmath91 is obtained by adding a square twice from @xmath44 isotopic to @xmath47 : we add a square along @xmath42 to @xmath44 first ( then we have @xmath14 ) , and add another square along @xmath58 or @xmath56 second .",
    "we see the plane curve obtained by the first square addition ( blow - down ) in figure  [ fig : divev ] or figure  [ fig : divod ] . since the line @xmath56 can be moved to an edge of the l - shaped region by @xmath53-moves , we can add the second square .",
    "the curve becomes an l - shaped curve of type @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "by @xcite , it presents the required cable knot @xmath93 .      * acknowledgement . *",
