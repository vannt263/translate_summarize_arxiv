    "small angle ( neutron ) scattering from polymers in dilute solution is the method of choice to obtain a complete picture of the conformations of long flexible or semiflexible macromolecules , from the length scale of the monomeric units to the gyration radius of the chain molecules  @xcite .",
    "classical experiments have shown that the gyration radius @xmath12 of long flexible chains in dense melts ( and also in dilute solution under theta conditions ) scales with chain length n according to the classical random walk picture  @xcite , @xmath13 , while in dilute solution under good solvent conditions flexible polymers form swollen coils  @xcite , @xmath14 , with  @xcite @xmath15 ( in @xmath1 dimensions ) or @xmath16 .",
    "it was also shown that on intermediate length scales the dependence of the scattering intensity @xmath17 on wave number @xmath18 reflects the self - similar fractal structure of the polymer  @xcite , @xmath19 ( under good solvent conditions ) or @xmath20 ( theta conditions or melts , respectively ) .",
    "also the crossovers between these regimes when either the temperature distance from the theta point or the concentration of the solution are varied have been investigated  @xcite , and the length scales ruling these crossovers ( i.e. , diameter of `` thermal blobs '' or `` concentration blobs '' , respectively ) have been identified  @xcite .",
    "the behavior gets more complicated , however , when chain stiffness plays a prominent role : only when chain stiffness is essentially due to chain thickness , i.e. when the effective persistence length @xmath21 scales proportional to the local chain diameter @xmath22 the problem can still be reduced to a rescaled self - avoiding walk problem  @xcite . however , when @xmath23 , one finds ( in @xmath1 ) a double crossover , since then short chains behave like rigid rods ( i.e. , @xmath24 as long as @xmath25 ) , and then a crossover to gaussian random - walk like coils occurs , while for @xmath26 ( @xmath27 will be discussed below ) a second crossover to swollen coils @xmath28 starts .",
    "also this behavior has been established in beautiful classical experiments  @xcite , as well as in recent simulations  @xcite .",
    "the standard model for semiflexible worm - like chains , the kratky - porod model  @xcite , can only describe the first crossover ( from rods to gaussian coils ) but fails to account for the second crossover to swollen coils , due to its complete neglect of excluded volume effects .",
    "it turns out that this second crossover still is incompletely understood : while in the early experiments  @xcite it was suggested that this crossover occurs for @xmath29 with @xmath30 kuhn segments , independent of the persistence length , a flory - type argument  @xcite suggests that the crossover occurs for a polymer radius @xmath31 ( corresponding to @xmath32 , while the simulations rather find  @xcite @xmath33 .",
    "remember that a worm - like chain can be described as an equivalent freely jointed chain of @xmath34 kuhn segments of length @xmath35 each  @xcite . in view of an apparent conflict of the estimate  @xcite @xmath36 with the yamakawa - stockmayer - shimata theory  @xcite for worm - like chains",
    "the result @xmath36 was considered as a very fundamental problem  @xcite . however , tsuboi et al  @xcite confirmed this estimate for another stiff polymer and concluded that the result @xmath36 is compatible with the theory .",
    "we also note that in @xmath0 there occurs a single crossover from rods to self - avoiding walks , any regime of gaussian - like behavior is completely absent  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize however , that the results of  @xcite imply that a universal number @xmath37 ( independent of @xmath21 ) up to which the kratky - porod model holds in @xmath1 does not exist .",
    "it then is interesting to ask how chain stiffness shows up on intermediate length scales , that can be probed via the scattering function @xmath17 .",
    "if one disregards excluded volume  @xcite and bases the treatment on the kratky - porod model , one can show  @xcite that the rod - like behavior at large @xmath18 leads to a scattering law proportional to @xmath38 , i.e. ( in @xmath1 dimensions ) @xmath39 where we have assumed that the chain has a contour length @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the bond length while the persistence length  @xcite is @xmath42 .",
    "while for gaussian `` phantom chains '' ( i.e. , excluded volume interactions are completely neglected ) the structure factor @xmath17 is readily found  @xcite in terms of the debye function , and the only length that enters is the gyration radius @xmath43 , choosing a normalization where @xmath44 @xmath45/\\zeta^2 \\ , , \\ , \\zeta =   q^2 \\langle r_g^2\\rangle = q^2n\\ell_b^2/6 \\ , , \\ ] ] for semiflexible polymers the calculation of @xmath17 for chains with @xmath46 finite is a formidable problem  @xcite , even in the absence of excluded volume effects . however , including excluded volume effects in the description of scattering of semiflexible chains is even more an unsolved problem : existing phenomenological approaches require the adjustment of many empirical parameters  @xcite .",
    "it will be one of the tasks that will be addressed in the present paper , to investigate @xmath17 for semiflexible chains numerically in the presence of excluded volume interactions between the effective monomers , varying @xmath21 over a wide range .    in recent years also",
    "the behavior of macromolecules under the influence of stretching forces has found enormous interest ( e.g.  @xcite ) , in particular for the study of bio - macromolecules . experimentally this can be realized e.g. by pulling at one end of a chain ,",
    "that is anchored at a substrate with the other chain end , by the tip of an atomic force microscope  @xcite but it is also conceivable to stretch polymers by the forces occurring when a polymer solution is exposed to strong shear flow  @xcite or elongational flow  @xcite . of course , it is not obvious that it will be possible to carry out scattering experiments on such stretched chains and measure the structure factor ( which then is anisotropic and has two relevant parts @xmath47 , @xmath48 since the direction of the scattering vector @xmath49 relative to the stretch direction , either parallel , @xmath50 , or perpendicular , @xmath51 , matters ) . but nevertheless a theoretical investigation of @xmath52 is worthwhile , because it gives detailed insight into the local structure of stretched chains , including also chains under cylindrical confinement  @xcite and this may help to understand problems such as transport of semiflexible polymers through porous materials , or channels in nanofluidic devices  @xcite , etc .",
    "thus we shall also investigate the structure factor of stretched semiflexible chains , extending previous work on flexible chains  @xcite .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we give a summary of the theoretical background , and in sec .",
    "iii we define our model and briefly recall the simulation methodology . in sec .",
    "iv we present our results for the structure factor @xmath17 of semiflexible chains , for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensions , in the absence of stretching forces .",
    "v describes the modifications of the structure factor due to stretching , while sec .",
    "vi summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the calculation of the scattering function of random walk chains under constant pulling forces can be carried out analytically and is presented in an appendix .",
    "we consider here the scattering from a single polymer chain , assuming that the chain can be described by a sequence of @xmath53 ( effective ) monomers at positions @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath53 , so that we can define @xmath46 bond vectors @xmath56 . in the absence of stretching forces ,",
    "the structure factor @xmath57 does not depend on the direction of the scattering vector @xmath49 , and can be defined as    @xmath58 \\right \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{(n+1)^{2 } } \\left\\{\\left \\langle \\left [ \\sum \\limits _ { j=1 } ^{n+1 }   \\sin ( \\vec{q } \\cdot \\vec{r}_j ) \\right]^2 \\right \\rangle +   \\left \\langle \\left [ \\sum \\limits _ { j=1 } ^{n+1 }    \\cos ( \\vec{q } \\cdot \\vec{r}_j ) \\right]^2",
    "\\right \\rangle \\right \\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that we have chosen here a normalization for which @xmath59 . when a stretching force is applied to one chain end in the + x - direction ,",
    "the structure factor becomes anisotropic . in @xmath1 dimensions ,",
    "the conformations of chains still have axis - symmetric geometries , and we must distinguish between @xmath47 , where @xmath49 is oriented in the x - direction parallel to the force , and @xmath60 , where @xmath49 is oriented perpendicular to it .",
    "so we define @xmath61 to obtain    @xmath62 ^ 2 \\right \\rangle + \\left \\langle   \\left [ \\sum \\limits _ { j=1}^{n+1 }   \\cos ( q_{||}x_j ) \\right]^2 \\right \\rangle \\right\\}\\ , , \\ ] ]    @xmath63 ^ 2 \\right \\rangle + \\left \\langle   \\left[\\sum \\limits _ { j=1}^{n+1 } \\cos ( \\vec{q}_\\bot \\cdot \\vec{\\rho}_j)\\right]^2   \\right \\rangle \\right\\ } \\ , .\\ ] ]    note that in @xmath0 dimensions we have @xmath64 and then @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) needs to be replaced simply by @xmath66 , of course .",
    "we also stress that in this paper we are not at all concerned with effects due to the local structure of ( effective ) monomers , such as e.g. chemical side groups , etc . ; such effects show up at large @xmath18 when one considers the scattering from real chains  @xcite .",
    "we next define our notation for characteristic lengths of the chain . assuming a rigidly fixed bond length @xmath41 between neighboring monomers along the chain , the contour length @xmath67 is @xmath68 the mean square end - to - end distance ( in the absence of stretching forces ) simply is @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the j - th bond vector , and the mean square gyration radius is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the center of mass position of the polymer .    in the presence of stretching forces",
    ", the chain takes a mean extension @xmath9 and mean square extensions also become anisotropic , @xmath73 @xmath74 eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) refers to the three - dimensional case , for @xmath0 the second term in the right hand side needs to be omitted .",
    "a related anisotropy can then be stated for the gyration radius square as well , namely @xmath75 @xmath76 \\right\\rangle \\,,\\ ] ] for @xmath1 , again the term @xmath77 simply is omitted in the case @xmath0 .",
    "we also recall that the mean square gyration radii describe the scattering functions at small @xmath49 .",
    "so in the absence of stretching forces we have @xmath78 while if stretching forces are present , one finds instead @xmath79 @xmath80 in addition to the limit @xmath81 , also the limiting behavior of @xmath82 is trivially known : then all interference terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) average to zero , and only the terms @xmath83 contribute to the double sum . hence we obtain @xmath84 irrespective of the value of the persistence length @xmath21 , the value of an applied force @xmath85 , etc .    at this point",
    "we emphasize , however , that it is not possible to write down a general definition for the persistence length @xmath21 that would be both universally valid and practically useful  @xcite .",
    "the definition often found in textbooks  @xcite in terms of the asymptotic decay of the bond vector orientational function ( of a very long chain , @xmath86 @xmath87 makes sense only for gaussian phantom chains , and is not applicable to real polymers under any circumstances , since the asymptotic decay of @xmath88 with the `` chemical distance '' @xmath89 along the chain always is a power - law decay .",
    "in fact , for @xmath90 one has  @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 both in melts  @xcite and for chains in dilute solution under theta conditions  @xcite . for the case of good solvent conditions , which is the problem of interest for the present paper , one rather finds the scaling law  @xcite @xmath93 which yields @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively . in simple cases , such as the semiflexible extension of the self - avoiding walk model studied in  @xcite and",
    "further investigated in the present work , one can rather use an analog of eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) but for short chemical distances , @xmath96 eq .  ( [ eq20 ] )",
    "is useful for the simple model that will be studied in the present paper , namely the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) on square and simple cubic lattices with an energy penalty @xmath3 for `` bond bending '' ( i.e. , kinks of the saw by 90 degrees ) , which then serves as a convenient parameter to control the persistence length . since for @xmath97 the power law , eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) , already starts to set in even for small @xmath98 of order unity already , we use in practice an alternative definition , @xmath99 which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) , if eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) holds over a more extended range of @xmath98 .",
    "an alternative method considers the distribution function @xmath100 of @xmath101 successive bond vectors @xmath102 having the same orientation without any kink , which is found to behave as  @xcite @xmath103 , with @xmath104 , @xmath105 being constants .",
    "both @xmath106 and @xmath105 can be taken as alternative estimates of a persistence length , and for large @xmath105 these estimates agree with the result from eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) to within a relative accuracy of a few percent ( or better ) , both in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , eq .  ( [ eq21 ] ) is not straightforwardly applicable for chemically realistic models ( such as alkane chains when @xmath41 means a bond between two successive carbon atoms , but the all - trans state corresponds to a zig - zag configuration with a nonzero bond angle @xmath107 ) .",
    "it also is not useful for coarse - grained models of polymers with complex architecture , such as bottle - brush polymers  @xcite .",
    "thus we emphasize that for our model eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) is a practically useful definition , while for real polymers studied experimentally the estimation of @xmath21 is a delicate problem .",
    "the same caveat applies for the kuhn length @xmath108 , which is @xmath109 for worm - like chains , but the latter does not apply in solutions , as stated above . in dense melts , @xmath110 is supposed to hold , but due to local interactions with neighboring monomers in a dense environment it is not obvious that @xmath108 for a melt is a relevant parameter for a chain under good solvent conditions .",

    "can only be evaluated numerically  @xcite .",
    "however , a few qualitative statements can be made on the structure factor @xmath17 in the representation of a kratky plot , @xmath145 plotted vs.  @xmath146 . while eqs  ( [ eq27])-([eq29 ] ) imply a monotonous increase from the straight line @xmath147 towards the plateau value @xmath148 for simple rigid rods , for semiflexible polymers this kratky plot exhibits a maximum , since in the regime of interest we may crudely approximate @xmath17 by its leading terms @xmath149 @xmath150 i.e. from eqs .",
    "( [ eq35 ] ) , ( [ eq24 ] ) we immediately find , for @xmath118 , @xmath151 using the full debye function one finds a different prefactor , @xmath152 , but the general scaling behavior is the same as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq37 ] ) .",
    "thus , when @xmath67 is known ( as is the case in simulations ) for semiflexible gaussian chains estimation of the coordinates of the maximum in the kratky plot allows a straightforward estimation of the persistence length @xmath21 .",
