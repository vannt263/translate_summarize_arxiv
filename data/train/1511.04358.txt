    "one of the most studied phenomenon in low - energy nuclear physics , both experimentally and theoretically , is the way nucleonic matter organises itself to support a variety of shapes observed in finite nuclei .",
    "the occurrence of different shapes , shape coexistence , and shape transitions have their origin in the evolution of single - nucleon shell structure with nuclear deformation , angular momentum , temperature and number of valence nucleons .",
    "the manifestation of shells is a generic property of finite fermion systems and shell closures , in particular , are characteristic of the confining single - particle potential .",
    "when nucleons completely fill a major shell ( single or doubly closed - shell nuclei ) , the relatively large energy gap to the next shell stabilises a spherical shape , whereas long - range correlations between valence nucleons in open - shell nuclei drive the nucleus toward deformed ( quadrupole , octupole ) equilibrium shapes .",
    "coexistence of different shapes in a single nucleus , and shape ( phase ) transitions as a function of nucleon number , present universal phenomena that occur in light , medium - heavy , heavy and superheavy nuclei , and reflect the organisation of nucleons in finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "a unified description of shape evolution and shape coexistence over the entire chart of nuclides necessitates a universal theory framework that can be applied to different mass regions .",
    "nuclear energy density functionals ( edf ) provide an economic , global and accurate microscopic approach to nuclear structure that can be extended from relatively light systems to superheavy nuclei , and from the valley of @xmath3-stability to the particle drip - lines @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important for extrapolations to regions far from stability where not enough data are available to determine the parameters of a more local approach such as , for instance , the interacting shell model .",
    "the basic implementation of the edf framework is in terms of self - consistent mean - field ( scmf ) models , in which an edf is constructed as a functional of one - body nucleon density matrices that correspond to a single product state .",
    "nuclear scmf models effectively map the many - body problem onto a one - body problem , and the exact edf is approximated by simple functionals of powers and gradients of ground - state nucleon densities and currents . some of the advantages of the edf approach are apparent already at the scmf level : an intuitive interpretation of mean - field results in terms of intrinsic shapes and single - nucleon states , and the possibility to formulate structure models in the full model space of occupied states , with no distinction between core and valence nucleons .",
    "quantitative studies of low - energy structure phenomena related to shell evolution and coexistence usually start from a constrained hartree - fock plus bcs ( hfbcs ) , or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculation of the deformation energy surfaces with mass multipole moments as constrained quantities .",
    "when based on microscopic edfs or effective interactions , such calculations comprise many - body correlations related to the short - range repulsive inter - nucleon interaction and long - range correlations mediated by nuclear resonance modes .",
    "the result are static symmetry - breaking product many - body states .",
    "the basic idea of a deformation energy surface is that , even though the quantum many - body system is determined by a very large number of microscopic states , these can be organised in a collection of basins that are robust to small external perturbations @xcite .",
    "the basins can be structurally distinct and distant from each other , but they can occur at comparable energies .    the constrained scmf method , however , produces semi - classical deformation energy surfaces .",
    "the static nuclear mean - field is characterised by the breaking of symmetries of the underlying hamiltonian ",
    "translational , rotational , particle number and , therefore , includes important static correlations , e.g. deformations and pairing . to calculate excitation spectra and electromagnetic transition rates it is necessary to extend the scmf scheme to include collective correlations that arise from symmetry restoration and fluctuations around the mean - field minima .",
    "collective correlations are sensitive to shell effects , display pronounced variations with particle number and , therefore , can not be incorporated in a universal edf but rather require an explicit treatment @xcite .    on the second level of implementation of nuclear edfs that takes into account collective correlations through the restoration of broken symmetries and configuration mixing of symmetry - breaking product states ,",
    "the many - body energy takes the form of a functional of all transition density matrices that can be constructed from the chosen set of product states .",
    "this set is chosen to restore symmetries or / and to perform a mixing of configurations that correspond to specific collective modes using , for instance , the ( quasiparticle ) random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) or the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite .",
    "the latter includes correlations related to finite - size fluctuations in a collective degree of freedom and presents the most effective approach for configuration mixing calculations , with multipole moments used as coordinates that generate the intrinsic wave functions .",
    "many interesting phenomena related to shell evolution have been investigated over the last decade by employing gcm configuration mixing of angular - momentum and particle - number projected states based on energy density functionals or effective interactions , but the extension of this method to non - axial shapes and/or heavy nuclei still presents formidable conceptual and computational challenges @xcite . in an alternative approach to nuclear collective dynamics that restores rotational symmetry and allows for fluctuations around mean - field minima ,",
    "a collective hamiltonian can be formulated , with deformation - dependent parameters determined by self - consistent mean - field calculations @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the collective hamiltonian is governed by the vibrational inertial functions and the moments of inertia @xcite , and these functions are determined by the microscopic nuclear energy density functional and the effective interaction in the pairing channel .",
    "five - dimensional collective hamiltonian models for quadrupole vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom , with parameters determined by constrained triaxial scmf calculations based on the gogny effective interaction @xcite , the skyrme density functional @xcite , and relativistic density functionals @xcite , have been developed over the last decade and applied in a number of studies of structure phenomena related to shape coexistence and shape transitions .",
    "the present study is based on the framework of relativistic energy density functionals , extended to include the treatment of collective correlations using the collective hamiltonian model @xcite . to emphasise the universality of the edf approach ,",
    "all illustrative calculations performed in this study , from relatively light systems to very heavy nuclei , have been carried out using a single energy density functional  dd - pc1 @xcite .",
    "starting from microscopic nucleon self - energies in nuclear matter , and empirical global properties of the nuclear matter equation of state , the coupling parameters of dd - pc1 were fine - tuned to the experimental masses of a set of 64 deformed nuclei in the mass regions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the functional has been further tested in a number of mean - field and beyond - mean - field calculations in different mass regions . for the examples considered here , pairing correlations",
    "have been taken into account by employing an interaction that is separable in momentum space , and is completely determined by two parameters adjusted to reproduce the empirical bell - shaped pairing gap in symmetric nuclear matter @xcite . for the details of the particular implementation of the edf - based collective hamiltonian used in the present study , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "for a self - consistent description of collective excitation spectra and electromagnetic transition rates , the framework of ( relativistic ) energy density functionals has to be extended to take into account collective correlations in relation to restoration of broken symmetries and fluctuations in collective coordinates .",
    "both types of correlations can be included simultaneously by mixing symmetry - projected states corresponding to different values of chosen collective coordinates .",
    "the most effective approach for configuration mixing calculations is the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , with multipole moments used as coordinates that generate the intrinsic wave functions .",
    "the gcm is based on the assumption that , starting from a set of mean - field states @xmath6 that depend on a collective coordinate @xmath7 , one can build approximate eigenstates of the nuclear hamiltonian : @xmath8 here the basis states @xmath6 are slater determinants of single - nucleon states generated by constrained scmf calculations .",
    "several advanced implementations of the gcm have been developed recently , fully based on the microscopic edf framework .",
    "for the relativistic scmf approach , in particular , the most advanced model performs configuration mixing of angular - momentum and particle - number projected wave functions generated by constraints on quadrupole deformations @xcite @xmath9    where @xmath10 denotes different collective states for a given angular momentum @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denotes a set of intrinsic scmf states with deformation parameters @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the angular momentum projection operator , and the operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 project onto states with good neutron and proton number , respectively .",
    "this implementation is equivalent to a seven - dimensional gcm calculation , mixing all five degrees of freedom of the quadrupole operator and the gauge angles for protons and neutrons .",
    "the weight functions @xmath17 in the collective wave function are determined from the variational equation : @xmath18 that is , by requiring that the expectation value of the hamiltonian is stationary with respect to an arbitrary variation @xmath19 .",
    "this leads to the hill - wheeler - griffin ( hwg ) integral equation : @xmath20    f^{jk^\\prime}_\\alpha(q^\\prime)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the projected gcm kernel matrices of the hamiltonian and the norm , respectively @xcite .",
    "multidimensional gcm calculations involve a number of technical and computational issues @xcite , that have so far impeded systematic applications to medium - heavy and heavy nuclei .",
    "collective dynamics can also be described using an alternative method in which a collective hamiltonian is constructed , with deformation - dependent parameters determined from microscopic scmf calculations @xcite .",
    "the collective hamiltonian can be derived in the gaussian overlap approximation ( goa )  @xcite to the full multi - dimensional gcm . with the assumption that the gcm overlap kernels can be approximated by gaussian functions ,",
    "the local expansion of the kernels up to second order in the non - locality transforms the gcm hill - wheeler equation into a second - order differential equation - the schrdinger equation for the collective hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , in the case of quadrupole degrees of freedom : @xmath23 where the vibrational kinetic energy is parameterized by the the mass parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xmath27\\right .",

    "the self - consistent mean - field solution for the single - quasiparticle energies and wave functions for the entire energy surface , as functions of the quadrupole deformations @xmath3 and @xmath33 , provide the microscopic input for calculation of the mass parameters , moments of inertia and the collective potential .",
    "the hamiltonian describes quadrupole vibrations , rotations , and the coupling of these collective modes .",
    "the dynamics of the collective bohr hamiltonian is governed by the vibrational inertial functions and the moments of inertia @xcite . for these quantities either the gcm - goa or the adiabatic approximation to the time - dependent hfb ( atdhfb ) expressions ( thouless - valatin masses ) can be used .",
    "the thouless - valatin masses have the advantage that they also include the time - odd components of the mean - field potential and , in this sense , the full dynamics of a nuclear system . in the gcm approach",
    "these components can only be included if , in addition to the coordinates @xmath34 , the corresponding canonically conjugate momenta @xmath35",
    "are also taken into account . in many applications , including the collective hamiltonians considered in the present study , a further simplification is thus introduced in terms of cranking formulas , i.e. the perturbative limit for the thouless - valatin masses , and the corresponding expressions for zpe corrections @xcite . in the present implementation of the collective hamiltonian model the moments of inertia and mass parameters do not include the contributions of time - odd mean - fields ( the so called dynamical rearrangement contributions ) and , to a certain extent , this breaks the self - consistency of the approach @xcite .    the diagonalization of the collective hamiltonian gives the energy spectrum @xmath36 and the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath37 that are used to calculate various observables , for instance the e2 reduced transition probabilities .",
    "the shape of a nucleus can be characterized in a qualitative way by the expectation values of invariants @xmath38 , @xmath39 , as well as their combinations .",
    "nuclear excitations characterised by quadrupole and octupole vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom can be simultaneously described by considering quadrupole and octupole collective coordinates that specify the surface of a nucleus @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "in addition , when axial symmetry is imposed , the collective coordinates can be parameterized in terms of two deformation parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and three euler angles @xmath43 .",
    "after quantization the collective hamiltonian takes the form @xmath44 where the mass parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the moment of inertia @xmath48 , are functions of the quadrupole @xmath41 and octupole @xmath42 deformations .",
    "@xmath49 .",
    "just as in the case of the quadrupole five - dimensional collective hamiltonian , the moments of inertia are calculated from the inglis - belyaev formula : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angular momentum along the axis perpendicular to the symmetric axis , the summation runs over proton and neutron quasiparticle states @xmath52 , and @xmath53 represents the quasiparticle vacuum .",
    "the quasiparticle energies @xmath54 and wave functions are determined by scmf calculations of deformation energy surfaces with constraints on the quadrupole and octupole deformation parameters .",
    "the mass parameters associated with the collective coordinates @xmath55 and @xmath56 are calculated in the cranking approximation , as well as the vibrational and rotational zero - point energy corrections to the collective energy surface @xcite .",
    "nuclei with closed major proton and/or neutron shells are usually characterised by spherical equilibrium shapes",
    ". however , this is not necessarily the case for nuclei away from the @xmath3-stability line in which energy spacings between single - particle levels can undergo considerable changes with the number of neutrons and/or protons .",
    "this can result in reduced spherical shell gaps , modifications of shell structure , and in some cases spherical magic numbers may disappear . the reduction of a spherical shell closure is associated with the occurrence of deformed ground states and , in a number of cases , with the phenomenon of shape coexistence . because of the low density of single - particle states close to the fermi surface , in relatively light nuclei coexistence occurs only when proton and neutron density distributions favour different equilibrium deformations , e.g. prolate _ vs _ oblate shapes .",
    "here we consider the well known example of neutron - rich @xmath0 isotones , which exhibit rapid shape variations and shape coexistence .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : n28_pes ] we plot the self - consistent triaxial quadrupole deformation energy surfaces of @xmath0 isotones @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium shape of the doubly - magic nucleus @xmath58ca is , of course , spherical but the @xmath0 spherical shell is strongly reduced in the isotones with a smaller number of protons .",
    "this leads to rapid transitions between deformed equilibrium shapes and shape coexistence in @xmath59s .",
    "the energy surface of @xmath60ar is soft both in @xmath3 and @xmath33 directions , with a shallow extended minimum along the oblate axis .",

    "then , for the constant value @xmath94 , the path continues from @xmath90 to @xmath95 .",
