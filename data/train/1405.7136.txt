    "<S> the time lag between the publication of a nobel discovery and the conferment of the prize has been rapidly increasing for all disciplines , especially for physics . </S>",
    "<S> does this mean that fundamental science is running out of groundbreaking discoveries ?    </S>",
    "<S> the 2013 nobel prize in physics was awarded to higgs and englert for their prediction of the existence of the higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> though the higgs particle was experimentally discovered at cern in 2012 , the original theoretical works date back to the 1960s . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it took about half a century of intense work to confirm their prediction .    </S>",
    "<S> long time lags between discovery and recognition are not unusual . in fact </S>",
    "<S> , it has been significantly increasing over the years ( figure 1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.002 , 0.008@xmath00.002 and 0.008@xmath00.001 for physics , chemistry and physiology or medicine , respectively . ]    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath1 be the time between the discovery and the nobel award . </S>",
    "<S> we model the variation of @xmath1 with time @xmath2 by considering an exponential law : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the rate of increase in @xmath1 and @xmath5 is a proportionality constant . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows an increase in @xmath1 for all fields . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted values and indicated 95% confidence intervals are given by the exponential regression model . in order to validate our regression analysis </S>",
    "<S> we check the residuals , as measured by the difference between the observed and the predicted values . </S>",
    "<S> the linear regression model shows non - random patterns in the residual plots . </S>",
    "<S> a piece - wise linear regression shows that the slopes of the curves consistently increase with time for all the fields . </S>",
    "<S> we concluded that the observed increase is faster than linear . in order to fit the data using a model with minimum number of parameters , consistent with the above observation </S>",
    "<S> , we used the exponential regression model of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : nsinced_exp ] . indeed , the exponential fit turns out to be better than the linear one , although the conclusions are essentially the same in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of increase in @xmath1 is the highest for physics , followed by chemistry and by physiology or medicine . on the x - axis of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we report the year when the nobel prize was actually awarded . </S>",
    "<S> this means that future awards for already published discoveries will have no influence on the ones shown in our plots , they will contribute to the future evolution of the curves .    in order to corroborate our results about the growing time lag between discovery and prize we consider the frequency of awards within t years of discovery ( 20 years in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . using a logistic regression model we measure whether this probability is decreasing with time and how . </S>",
    "<S> simple logistic regression is analogous to linear regression , except that the dependent variable is nominal , not a measurement . in the present case </S>",
    "<S> it would be `` prize within 20 years of discovery '' or `` prize after 20 years of discovery '' . </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to see whether the probability of getting a particular value of the nominal variable ( binary response in our case ) is associated with the measurement variable ( time ) .        </S>",
    "<S> we estimate first - degree logistic polynomial regressions for all the fields and show the predicted values and 95% confidence intervals . </S>",
    "<S> the conditional probability of the discovery being awarded within @xmath6 years is given by @xmath7 } ,     \\label{eq : nsinced_logistic}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are estimated using the maximum likelihood method .        </S>",
    "<S> after 1985 , about 15% of physics , 18% of chemistry and 9% of physiology or medicine prizes are awarded within 10 years of their discovery . in contrast , before 1940 about 61% of physics , 48% of chemistry and 45% of physiology or medicine prizes are awarded within 10 years of the discovery . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , after 1985 about 60% of physics , 52% of chemistry and 49% of physiology or medicine prizes are awarded over 20 years of the discovery . in comparison , before 1940 only about 11% of physics , 15% of chemistry and 24% of physiology or medicine prizes were awarded over 20 years of the discovery . in all fields </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the prize being awarded over 20 years since discovery is increasing . the rate of increase in the frequency of getting the award 20 plus years since the discovery is fastest for physics and slowest for physiology or medicine .    as a result of the increasing time to recognize a nobel discovery , the age at which laureates receive the award is also increasing . </S>",
    "<S> this is also determined by the increasing age at which major discoveries are made  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider how the age at which scientists are awarded the nobel prize @xmath10 is changing with time . </S>",
    "<S> an exponential increase is represented by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the rate of increase of the age and @xmath13 is a proportionality constant .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows that @xmath10 is increasing for the three fields . </S>",
    "<S> we also used the regression model to project the age of the laureates at the time of the award until the end of the century . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted values and indicated 95% confidence intervals are given by the exponential regression model . </S>",
    "<S> the figure also shows the projected life expectancies ( of men and women combined together ) across the 21st century . </S>",
    "<S> here we used the data of the united states as a proxy of the life expectancy ( as us citizens have been awarded the majority of nobel prizes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the expectancy is based on wpp2012 estimates using the medium scenario and the 95% prediction interval is also shown  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found that by the end of this century for the fields of physics and chemistry , the nobel laureates age at discovery would become higher than the life expectancy .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if this trend is maintained , by the end of this century the average age of nobel prize awarding shall reach life expectancy , with easily conceivable consequences .    what is the reason of the increasing delay between discovery and recognition ? to make the discussion serious , one should first take into account the effects of the change of society on scientific research , which may affect nobel prize awarding . the increasing number of scientists , the increasing life expectancy , the changing research and career policies , the increasing training time etc . </S>",
    "<S> must all certainly play a role . </S>",
    "<S> yet , one can reasonably assume that these factors affect all disciplines to a comparable extent and can not explain the remaining differences , like the one which is observed between physics and medicine . under this assumption </S>",
    "<S> , our analysis suggests that frequency of groundbreaking discoveries in fundamental science is decreasing . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that fundamental science has undergone major changes over the past century , becoming a highly collaborative endeavour requiring a sustained effort by large teams over many years and yet , this might just be another facet of the problem , namely the increasing objective difficulty in achieving progress . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative interpretation of the difference between physics and medicine would be its converse : since no more than two discoveries can be awarded the nobel prize at the same time , it could be that the number of important discoveries is in fact increasing , and that , in order not to lose worthy winners , one is forced to dig deeper and deeper in the past . </S>",
    "<S> however , we think that this interpretation is disfavoured . </S>",
    "<S> first , it should be noted that , on the average , recognition takes a longer time , but it is also true that , even in modern times , there have been major discoveries that have been quickly recognized and awarded ( e.g. graphene ) . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , if the frequency of breakthroughs was stable or even increasing in time , the fluctuations with respect to the average `` importance '' of each awarded discovery would likewise increase in time . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one would expect a comparable or higher frequency of exceptional advances ( relativity - like hits ) , in recent times , which does not seem to have occurred . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is hard to imagine that such extra - important discoveries would be held in stand - by to recognize less important discoveries of the past . </S>"
