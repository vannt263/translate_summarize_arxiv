    "within the past months , @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 has been attributed as the source of several rotational lines observed in the horsehead nebula photon - dominated region ( pdr ) @xcite . in order for the observed spectral features to be linked to a single molecular carrier ,",
    "the molecule must be linear with a @xmath9 ground state and a lone ( @xmath3-type ) rotational constant close to 11.24 ghz .",
    "however , only standard quantum chemical computations of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 have given qualitative corroborating evidence for the rotational constants , and no quantitative , high - accuracy reference data , either from computation or laboratory experiment , exists for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding c@xmath1h radical has long been known to exist in the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite and was confirmed with concurrently generated laboratory reference data @xcite . although laboratory studies of known interstellar molecules in simulated interstellar environments have often produced what is believed to be c@xmath1h@xmath2 @xcite with theory providing further insights @xcite , neither high - accuracy rotational nor vibrational spectroscopic data has yet been generated for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "recently , we have employed state - of - the art @xmath10 @xmath11 quartic force fields ( qffs ) and perturbation theory at second order @xcite to compute rotational constants that are within 20 mhz or better of experiment @xcite for similar tetra - atomic systems .",
    "the use of qffs has also been applied to other molecules of interstellar relevance in order to compute accurately their spectroscopic constants in addition to their fundamental vibrational frequencies and even some overtones and combination bands @xcite . since high - accuracy reference data",
    "is currently not available for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 , the methods utilized previously are employed here in order to assist in confirmation for the detection of this cation in the horsehead nebula .",
    "additionally , we will also supply spectroscopic constants and vibrational frequencies for the deuterated form and for each of the three @xmath12c singly - substituted isotopologues .",
    "utilizing the molpro 2006.1 suite of quantum chemical programs @xcite , spin - restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) @xcite coupled cluster theory @xcite at the singles , doubles , and perturbative triples level [ ccsd(t ) ] @xcite is employed to compute the reference geometry .",
    "this initial geometry is based on a composite approach to give the most accurate bond lengths in this linear molecule .",
    "the ccsd(t ) bond lengths ( denoted as @xmath13 ) computed with the cc - pv5z basis set @xcite are corrected for effects from the smaller cc - pvqz basis set as well as core correlation and scalar relativistic effects @xcite through the following approach : @xmath14 the @xmath15 ccsd(t ) geometry optimization makes use of the standard cc - pvqz - dk basis set , which can account for relativistic effects , further augmented to include core correlating @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 functions from the standard cc - pcvqz basis set @xcite .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "[ bondlengths ] serves to isolate the scalar relativistic and core correlating effects so that they may then enhance the standard cc - pv5z bond lengths .    from this reference geometry , the quartic force field ( qff )",
    "is created from displacements of 0.005   and 0.005 radians @xcite , respectively for the three bond lengths and two doubly - degenerate linear bends , and contains 569 points . at each point",
    "ccsd(t)/cc - pvtz , cc - pvqz , and cc - pv5z energies are computed and extrapolated to the complete basis set ( cbs ) limit via a three - point formula @xcite . the cbs energy is then corrected for scalar relativity @xcite and core correlation effects from the martin - taylor basis set @xcite .",
    "this results in the cccr qff defined previously @xcite .",
    "the qff is then fit with a sum of residual squares of @xmath20 a.u.@xmath21 to a taylor series expansion .",
    "since the reference geometry is close to but not identical to the exact minimum , the qff is then transformed to the exact minimum leading to a potential of the form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are force constants and @xmath24 are the displacements . for further details on this procedure",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this high - symmetry @xmath25 system is most easily represented in the simple - internal coordinate system defined here ( with atom numbering from fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) as : @xmath26 these coordinate subscripts correspond to the force constants given in table [ fc ] .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28 quantities are necessary to define the linear bending angles ( @xmath29 ) and correspond to a direction perpendicular to the bending plane so that degenerate linear modes may be uniquely specified , since @xmath30 .",
    "second - order vibrational perturbation theory ( vpt2 ) @xcite via the spectro program @xcite produces the desired spectroscopic constants and vibrational frequencies . since the qff is computed within the born - oppenheimer approximation , only the spectro anharmonic analyses differ between the five total isotopologues .",
    "the @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 and isotopologue bond lengths , rotational constants , quartic and sextic centrifugal distortion constants , and center - of - mass dipole moments are given in table [ structharm ] for this @xmath31 cation .",
    "the fundamental vibrational frequencies are listed in table [ vptvci ] .",
    "exploratory ccsd(t)/cc - pvtz computations indicate that a @xmath32 state exists 40.3 kcal / mol ( 1.75 ev ) higher than the ground @xmath31 state , and the @xmath32 c@xmath1h@xmath2 @xmath33 is more than 350 mhz higher than the @xmath34 c@xmath1h@xmath2 @xmath33 .",
    "hence , effects from the @xmath32 state should not be important .",
    "the relevant @xmath31 c@xmath1h@xmath2 data are in fairly good agreement with the full - dimensional pes computed previously given the much lower level of theory used @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the scalar relativity correction is necessary since , for example , @xmath35 for standard @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 computed with only the cbs - energy - including qff is 11 209.78 mhz , while the cr qff ( which additionally includes the relativistic terms , see @xcite ) raises this value to 11 213.99 mhz . similarly but more importantly , core correlation is also necessary as the rotational constant for the ccc qff , which is the cbs plus core correlation qff , puts @xmath35 at 11 258.41 mhz .",
    "the total cccr qff @xmath35 , listed in table [ structharm ] , is thus 11 262.68 mhz .",
    "this value differs by 17.73 mhz from that ( 11 244.947 4 mhz ) obtained in the fitting by @xcite to assign the observed lines in the horsehead nebula to @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "this represents similar accuracy as that noted previously for the @xmath36- and @xmath37-hoco radicals @xcite , @xmath37-hoco@xmath2 @xcite , and @xmath37-hocs@xmath2 @xcite , as well as many other examples .    however , the correspondence between theory and experiment for the @xmath4-type constant is not as good .",
    "the cccr @xmath38 value is 4.248 khz while the @xmath4 value obtained by @xcite in their second - order fit is 7.652 khz and 7.766 khz for their third - order fit .",
    "this represents a difference of 3.404 khz or 44.5% between theory and experiment for the second - order fit @xmath4 and is larger still for the third - order fit . though this is a comparison of @xmath38 to @xmath39 , i.e. , vibrational averaging",
    "is not included in the theoretical value , the percentage change between the computed @xmath35 and @xmath33 values for this same molecule is only 0.77% .",
    "further , various qffs have been formulated to examine this system ( 33 in all ) ranging from those that are state - of - the art and have been proven to yield highly - accurate spectroscopic constants including @xmath4 , such as the given cccr qff , to those that use more modest levels of theory , such as ccsd(t)/cc - pvtz , and the range in @xmath38 values for these qffs is only 0.053 khz , which conclusively shows that the @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath38 value is converged to an extent that rules out a value near 7.6 - 7.8 khz .",
    "additionally , other linear systems have been studied using similar theoretical approaches .",
    "for instance , the percentage error between the computed @xmath38 ( 84.135 khz ) and the experimental @xmath4 [ 87.22 khz from @xcite ] is 3.5% for hcn computed with a ccsd(t)/ano1 qff @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4/@xmath38 error for cch@xmath40 is 2.1% as computed with a cccre qff ( with corrections for higher - order electron correlation effects :  e \" ) in the same second order perturbational approach utilized here , where @xmath38 is 94.3 khz @xcite , and the experimental @xmath4 is 96.97 khz @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the error for acetylene is only 2.27% between a @xmath38 of 47.673 khz @xcite and a @xmath4 of 48.780 khz @xcite .",
    "perhaps a more relevant example for the current case is given for c@xmath1n@xmath40 where @xmath39 has been experimentally determined to be 0.68 578 khz and a ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvqz qff yields a @xmath38 of 0.627 khz @xcite .",
    "the 8.57% error is still much less than the 44.5% discrepancy for c@xmath1h@xmath2 and is probably somewhat larger then the other examples because of using lower levels of theory to compute the qff , and because it is well known that small molecular anions are harder to describe accurately .",
    "hence , the known errors for these systems are an order of magnitude smaller than that which is present for @xmath38 and @xmath4 in @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 . as a result",
    ", we can not attribute the substantial disagreement between the computed @xmath38 for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 and the @xmath4 value obtained by @xcite merely to errors in the theoretical approach .",
    "thus , it is doubtful that the series of lines observed in the horsehead nebula actually correspond to @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "if the computed @xmath38 value closely represents the actual @xmath4 for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 and assuming the @xmath35 value reported by @xcite , the @xmath41 transition will differ from that reported by @xcite by 0.9 mhz .",
    "the @xmath42 transition will differ by 1.7 mhz , @xmath43 by about 3.0 mhz , and these differences will continue to increase up to 23.4 mhz as @xmath7 increases to the @xmath44 transition . for high - resolution",
    "rotational spectroscopy , these large discrepancies are well outside of the precision present in most spectrometers utilized in the laboratory and for observation of the ism , and well outside the errors expected from state - of - the art @xmath10 @xmath11 calculations .",
    "for example , @xcite computed the rotational transitions of hcnh@xmath2 with a six - dimensional pes from a ccsd(t)-f12a / cc - pcvtz - f12 qff for @xmath45 up to @xmath46 with errors ranging from 0.6 mhz to 4.84 mhz compared to experimental work @xcite .",
    "this comparison of theory and experiment again strongly supports our assertion that the assignment of the observations in the horsehead nebula pdr to @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 are incorrect .    similarly , the computed @xmath47 value for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 is 0.375 mhz , while the third - order fit @xmath5 obtained by @xcite is 0.56 hz or 560 mhz .",
    "this represents three orders of magnitude difference between the two values .",
    "there are not as many comparisons in the literature between theoretical @xmath47 values and experimental @xmath5 values , but for acetylene , @xmath47 has been computed to be 0.0380 hz @xcite , while @xmath5 has been experimentally determined to be 0.0480 hz @xcite , an error of 20.8% . even if the computed @xmath47 for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 is in error from the proper physical value by as much as 40% ,",
    "this is only a minute step towards the value necessary to fit the lines observed .",
    "admittedly , comparison of computed @xmath47 values to experimental @xmath5 constants has not been as common making the error range for the computed value less certain , but the substantially large difference between values here should be well - beyond the potential accuracy range for the computed @xmath47 .",
    "this difference in the @xmath5 constant casts further doubt on @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 as the carrier of the observed transitions in the horsehead nebula pdr .",
    "since the energy points necessary to define the qff are computed within the born - oppenheimer approximation , the same qff can also be used to produce vpt2 spectroscopic constants and vibrational frequencies for the isotopologues , as well .",
    "thus , the spectroscopic constants of c@xmath1d@xmath2 , @xmath12ccch@xmath2 , c@xmath12cch@xmath2 , and cc@xmath12ch@xmath2 are listed in table [ structharm ] , and the fundamental vibrational frequencies are given in table [ vptvci ] .",
    "these reference data should aid in the analysis of further laboratory studies of interstellar reactions that create @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "even though the cccr vpt2 computed @xmath35 rotational constant for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 differs by less than 20 mhz from that obtained by @xcite to assign lines in the horsehead nebula pdr to this cation , the more substantial differences between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 constants strongly questions the assignment of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 to the observed lines .",
    "these large discrepancies , especially for the @xmath4 constant , will alter the rotational spectrum of @xmath48 c@xmath1h@xmath2 by nearly 1 mhz for the lowest observed rotational transition , @xmath6 , and by more than 23 mhz for the highest , @xmath49 . hence , the astronomical lines observed can not be conclusively linked to this cation as the carrier .",
    "it is hoped that the reference data provided here should assist in laboratory studies that can conclusively determine the rotational spectrum of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "additionally , the data are extended to the deuterated and @xmath12c singly - substituted isotopologues as well .",
    "c@xmath1h@xmath2 has long been hypothesized to exist in the ism and is of significance in the carbon chemistry of space @xcite .",
    "there is little doubt that it should be present in ism , but the attribution of the observed lines by @xcite to @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 is questionable .",
