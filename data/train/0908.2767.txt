    "is generally quoted as the essential reason for discarding dft calculations for high - t@xmath1 copper oxides @xcite .",
    "dft is essentially exact , but the approximations to make it practical for use in real applications seem inappropriate for oxides .",
    "however , despite this problem there are several lda results that fit to the observed high - t@xmath1 properties , provided that doping and supercells are considered in order to account for imperfect lattice conditions such as stripes , phonons or spin waves @xcite . here",
    "is presented a short review of those dft results together with a discussion of the correlation problem and an attempt to include further corrections to lsda .",

    "the lmto calculations are slow for large supercells .",
    "the cells need to be large to cover the periodicity of realistic phonon and/or spin - waves , and so far it has been possible to extend the cells in one direction only , usually the cuo bond direction .",
    "in contrast , the nfe model is very simple and it can easily be extended to two dimensions ( 2d ) . the band dispersion for k - points @xmath19",
    "is now obtained from the eigenvalues of a 3x3 matrix @xcite .",

    "the potential modulations are parallel to the cuo bond directions along @xmath14 and @xmath21 , so the gaps appear on the @xmath22 and @xmath23 lines , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "however , almost no effect from @xmath13 appears on the band dispersion in the diagonal direction ( along @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , the fermi surface ( fs ) is not affected along the diagonal , but fluctuations , described through amplitude variations of @xmath13 for different positions and different time , will make the fs smeared in the two bond directions .",

    "by 1d ( 1-dimensional ) lmto we mean ab - initio lmto calculations for long ( and narrow ) supercells most often oriented along the cuo bond direction @xcite .",
    "these calculations are based on the local version of dft , the local ( spin ) density approximation , lda or lsda @xcite .",
    "cells with phonon distortions and/or spin waves within lengths of 4,8 and 12 lattice constants are typically considered in these calculations .",

    "hole doping , @xmath25 , in la@xmath26ba@xmath27cuo@xmath4 ( lbco ) is generally modeled by the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) where the nuclear and electronic la - charges ( 57.0 ) are reduced to ( 57-@xmath28 ) to account for a perfectly delocalized doping ( @xmath25 in holes per cu ) .",
    "but some calculations with real la / ba substitutions show that improved superconducting properties can be expected from periodic doping distributions @xcite . the maximal phonon distortion , @xmath29 , for different sites , @xmath30 , and afm magnetic moments on cu , @xmath31 , depend on temperature , @xmath32 , force constants and spin stiffness .",

    "the fs is well defined in the diagonal direction , while the fluctuations makes it diffuse in the @xmath38 and @xmath39-directions.,width=313,height=238 ]    a striking result of these calculations ( also made for hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ) is that a gap ( or a pseudogap ) will open up in the dos , very similar to what is found in the nfe models .",
    "the gap will appear near to @xmath40 for the undoped material if the wavelengths ( @xmath41 ) are long , while for short phonons or spin waves the gap moves to lower energy @xcite .",
    "in summary , @xmath42 , where @xmath41 is in units of @xmath7 and @xmath25 is the number of holes per cu .",
    "a second important result is that the spin waves will be stronger , and the pseudogaps will be deeper , if the waves coexist with phonon distortions of the correct wave length and phase @xcite .",
    "interactions between phonons and spin waves have also been suggested in order to explain neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "phonons like the `` half - breathing '' o - mode and modes with z - displacements of la and apical oxygens are most effective in this process of spc .",
    "this mechanism offers direct explanations of phonon softening , q - dependent spin excitations and various isotope effects @xcite .",
    "the rather few lmto results permit to establish only a few values of @xmath13 for different @xmath43,@xmath30 of the phonons and spin waves .",
    "a general trend of larger @xmath13 for long wave lengths seems clear , both for phonons and for spin waves . a procedure based on the partial character of the states above and below",
    "the gap in the nfe model confirms this trend for spin waves , and it permits to fill in some of the q - dependent points not calculated by lmto . in all",
    "this gives some confidence in the @xmath44-variations of @xmath13 .",
    "however , one can expect more vivid variations of the spin part near @xmath45 , because lda underestimates the transition towards afm .    when these @xmath13-values are fed into the 2d nfe model it gives an approximately linear variation of @xmath43 as function of @xmath25 , up to a saturation near @xmath46 for @xmath25 larger than @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "hence , the linear dependence for low @xmath25 is in qualitative agreement with the result from 1d - lmto , but the pace is different .",
    "this is probably because the gap opens @xmath48 along @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the 2d nfe model , which makes the progression of the gap a bit slower than in 1d .",
    "the saturation is because the @xmath13 s decrease for increasing @xmath43 and it becomes impossible to open a gap at the low energy where @xmath40 should be for large @xmath25 .",
    "however , if @xmath49 and @xmath50 are assumed to be different in the 2d nfe model it is possible to follow one gap towards lower energy . a second weaker gap moves to higher energy .",
    "the emerging picture from these band results is that moderately strong spin fluctuations , which exist for many combinations of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , will be enhanced through spc to some particular phonon distortions .",
    "the selection depends on the atomic character of the phonon mode as well as on doping and wave length ( i.e. on @xmath51 ) .",
    "the latter is because the pseudogap appears at @xmath40 so that a maximum amount of kinetic energy can be gained from the spc mode .",
    "this is for low t when the states below the gap is of one spin and well separated from the ( unoccupied ) state of the other spin above the gap .",
    "but for increasing t there will be mixed occupations of the states around @xmath40 through the fermi - dirac function ( and through thermal disorder ) , which will decrease the spin density . this will decrease the spin polarization of the potential , which in turn will decrease the spin density even more , and at some temperature t@xmath53 the support of the pseudo gap from the spin wave will collapse @xcite . the fact that @xmath13 is largest at low doping favors larger t@xmath53 when @xmath54 .",
    "a high dos at @xmath40 is important for a high superconducting @xmath0 , and therefore is the pseudogap in competition with superconductivity in under - doped cuprates @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that non - adiabatic electron - phonon coupling could be enhanced in the cuprates , because of the low fermi velocity in the z - direction @xcite .",
    "this velocity is comparable to the vibrational velocity and the electronic screening appeared to be insufficient .",
    "however , the screening can be made by other electrons moving within the planes .",
    "moreover , phonon frequencies calculated within lda without assumptions of incomplete screening , agree satisfactory with experimental frequencies @xcite .",
    "instead , excitations of virtual phonons coupled to spin waves can be important for the mechanism of superconductivity , but spc makes the separation between pure electron - phonon coupling , @xmath55 , and @xmath2 caused by spin fluctuations , @xmath56 , less clear .",
    "the important observation is that atomic phonon distortions will trigger enhancement of spin waves .",
    "if so , the possibility for larger @xmath55 is open , because instead for the common approach to ignore spin effects in electron - phonon coupling , there are larger matrix elements when the spin polarized part of the potential is involved .",
    "this is readily imagined for a system which is nonmagnetic when phonon distortions are absent , but magnetic when the distortions are present .",
    "an estimation of pure @xmath55 and the coupling parameter for spc , @xmath57 , in lbco has been presented earlier @xcite . with a total @xmath58 , and distortion amplitudes and potential shifts as in ref .",
    "@xcite this leads to @xmath59 of the order 0.36 and 0.6 for pure phonons and spc , respectively @xcite .",
    "these values appear sufficiently large for a large @xmath0 in simple bcs - type formulations , but the precise relation for @xmath0 depends also on other parameters @xcite .",
    ".[table1 ] total energy ( @xmath60 , mry per cu ) , matrix element for spin fluctuations ( @xmath61 in mry ) , @xmath56 and local stoner enhancement , @xmath62 , calculated for lattices of lbco with two phonon distortions and without distortions . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in preliminary calculations for undoped lbco we do a rescaling of the exchange due to kinetic energy and of correlation due to second gradients .",
    "the comparison is made with standard lsda for an afm unit cell where a staggered magnetic field is applied to the cu sites , and it is found that a field of @xmath63 8.8 @xmath64 is the limit for having a zero gap @xmath65 .",
    "the magnetic moment is then @xmath66 per cu .",
    "the amplitude of the required magnetic field to obtain a zero gap is reduced when the calculations include the correction factors , see table ii .",
    "the absolute values can depend on details of the band calculations @xcite , but the trend towards a stability of an afm state is clear .",
    "corrections of this type will be interesting for seeing enhanced spin fluctuations for long wave length spin waves in doped cuprates .",
    "further enhancements of @xmath56 can also be expected @xcite .",
    "potential corrections must ultimately be tested for other types of materials in order to verify that some properties will not deteriorate . here for the cuprates the corrections permit to proceed in the modeling of more properties from the band results .",
    "results of band calculations for supercells with frozen phonons and spin waves suggest that a fermi - liquid state can cause pseudo gaps and dynamic stripes .",
    "together with a nfe model it is possible to describe the doping dependence of many normal state properties of the cuprates .",
    "the coupling between phonon distortions and spin fluctuations seems to be crucial for the mechanism of superconductivity , so that the spin - polarized part of @xmath2 is most enhanced by simultaneous excitations of phonons and spin waves .",
    "two different mechanisms for superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations are possible .",
    "the largest coupling parameter is when a phonon is excited together with the spin fluctuation .",
    "lower couplings , @xmath56 at larger energies , are independent of the phonon excitation , but these spin fluctuations can nevertheless profit from possible phonon distortions of the lattice . still , absolute numbers are too small when using lda , as is also concluded from the absence of afm stability in lda calculations for undoped systems .",
    "however , it is argued that corrections due to higher order density gradients and kinetic energy are able to bring the band calculations closer to afm .",
    "this is shown in calculations for undoped lbco by yet very approximate corrections due to non locality and kinetic energy .",
    "refinements of such corrections will be of interest for application to supercells , including doping , phonon distortions and spin waves , since it can be expected that realistic @xmath59 will be obtained .",
