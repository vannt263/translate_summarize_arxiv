    "particle and heat transport in disordered spin chains is actively studied last years  @xcite since these models present apparently simple examples of interacting quantum systems with frozen disorder .",
    "one particular example of a such studies is presented by our recent work  @xcite where thermal conductivity of weakly disordered spin-@xmath0 anisotropic ( xxz ) chain was calculated at low temperatures @xmath6 and in the anisotropy range @xmath10 . in that study we employed jordan - wigner transformation to the fermionic chain problem and then used standard bozonization technique  @xcite which is limited to the luttinger liquid approximation with a linear spectrum ( lll ) .",
    "it was found in  @xcite that such an approximation is valid for sufficiently low temperatures if @xmath11 and frozen disorder is weak , @xmath12 ; on the other hand , lll approximation breaks down completely at larger values of @xmath13 .",
    "effects of nonlinear spectrum in 1d quantum liquids have been actively studied from different viewpoints , see recent review  @xcite and papers  @xcite .",
    "there are basically two possible approaches to the problem , using either fermionic or bosonic representation . in the fermionic representation , bare spectrum of quasiparticles",
    "is @xmath7 , with @xmath14 at small @xmath15 . for a vanishing or very weak interaction between fermions , one can easily construct bosonic correlation function as composite objects made out of pair of fermions",
    ". then spectral function @xmath16 corresponding to any bosonic operator can be obtained as a convolution of two fermionic spectral functions and thus will have a finite width @xmath17 . however",
    ", this approach becomes rather complicated if interaction between fermions is not weak . on the other hand ,",
    "strong fermion - fermion interaction can be conviniently described in the bosonic representation , but then nonlinearity of the original fermionic spectrum transforms into non - linear interaction between ll bosons .",
    "this interaction is cubic if @xmath18 ( which is a general case ) and quartic in the case of particle - hole symmetry when @xmath19 .",
    "the problem with treatment of such an interaction within ll theory is nontrivial since for 1-dimensional particles with linear spectrum all interactions between particles with the same sign of velocity are of resonant nature as absolute value of velocity is fixed and particles stay in contact for arbitrarily long time . as a result",
    ", straightforward second - order perturbation theory produces diverging result for the imaginary part of the self - energy at the `` light cone '' : @xmath20 .    in the present paper",
    "we develop diagrammatic approach to the calculation of @xmath21 for bosonic excitations with energy @xmath22 which is low in comparison with the temperature @xmath23 .",
    "we show that in the limit @xmath24 quasiparticle decay rate @xmath25 can be found self - consistently near the light - cone , leading to a finite ( although non - analytic ) result .",
    "we consider below two different situations : pure exchange spin chain hamiltonian symmetric w.r.t . to @xmath26 inversion , and",
    "spin chain in presence of uniform magnetic field @xmath27 along @xmath28 axis , with @xmath29 . in the latter case our result is very similar to the one obtained long ago by a.f.andreev  @xcite for fluctuational correction to viscosity in a 1-dimensional classical hydrodynamics and rederived in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any previous calculations , which accounts for spectrum nonlinearity , for the symmetric case @xmath30 .",
    "we emphasize that the decay rate of bosonic excitations @xmath31 calculated in this paper does not coinside with inelastic relaxation rate ; rather it provides the measure of coherence for the specific type of excitations we study .",
    "the meaning of @xmath31 is that it determines ( due to direct local relation between bosonic and spin variables ) the shape of the dynamic spin - spin correlation function @xmath8 at @xmath32 .    for the possibility to develop a self - consistent diagrammatic approach",
    ", the condition @xmath24 is crucial . in the opposite limit more involved calculations",

    "another piece of work we mention is related with a discussion of the presence of the drude weight in these spin chains  @xcite .",
    "this interesting issue is beyond the scope of our study since it is related to the decay rate of the uniform current @xmath34 , whereas we calculated @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we formulate our model in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , develop diagrammatic perturbation theory in sec.[sec : lowestorder ] and extend it to the self - consistent approach in sec.[sec : selfconsistent ] , where major results for the decay rates @xmath37 are obtained .",

    "we study spin-@xmath38 anisotropic xxz spin chain with external magnetic field applied along the @xmath28 direction , which is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath39 the sign of exchange constant in the @xmath40 plane can be changed utilizing the canonical transformation @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ; this allows us to fix the sign of coupling constant @xmath44 .",

    "alternatively , one can introduce densities of right- and left - moving fermions @xmath59 and @xmath60 , consisting of fourier harmonics of @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "for further calculations , it will be convenient to rescale them with @xmath64 factor , so that @xmath65",
    ". explicit expression for the densities is @xmath66 , with upper sign corresponding to the right - movers and lower sign corresponding to the left - movers . in terms of these fields ,",
    "the quadratic part of the hamiltonian density is written as follows : @xmath67    in addition to the quadratic part , there are also irrelevant in the rg sense terms in the hamiltonian , which keep information about the lattice nature of the original model @xcite .",
    "the two most important of those irrelevant operators are so - called `` umklapp term '' and the `` band curvature term '' .",
    "the `` umklapp term '' is written as follows : @xmath68 such term has scaling dimension @xmath69 and is irrelevant at @xmath70 , that is @xmath71 .",
    "the effect of such term at nonzero temperatures was studied in ref .",

    "thus at zero magnetic field we will restrict ourselves to the region @xmath78 and consider hamiltonian @xmath80 .",
    "magnetic field behaves as a chemical potential for the jw fermions .",
    "shifting it away from the half - filling point with particle - hole symmetry leads to the appearing of the quadratic terms in the quasiparticle dispersion @xmath18 , which in language of the bosonization corresponds to the cubic interaction terms .",
    "these terms naturally appear if one performs the phase shift @xmath81 , that discards the magnetic field term from the quadratic part of the hamiltonian and takes into the account the nonlinear terms ; they read as follows : @xmath82 with constants @xmath83 the effect of quadratic curvature on the transport properties was studied in refs . @xcite . at sufficiently small magnetic fields ,",
    "cubic terms are less important compared to the quartic terms ; below it will be shown that crossover to the regime where cubic terms dominate in the quasiparticle decay happens at @xmath84 .",
    "the total hamiltonian at nonzero magnetic fields is thus @xmath85 , while the latter term can be neglected when the magnetic field is large enough .",
    "below we will study only the effect of `` band curvature term '' on the decay of the quasiparticles , restricting ourselves to the region @xmath78 where it is definitely more important at low @xmath23 , compared to the `` umklapp term '' .",
