    "the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ) aims to compile a homogeneous catalogue of @xmath7 qsos using the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) 2-degree field facility ( 2df ) @xcite .",
    "this catalogue will constitute a factor of @xmath8 increase in numbers to a equivalent flux limit over previous data sets @xcite .",
    "the main science goal of the 2qz is to use qsos as a probe of large - scale structure in the universe over a range of scales from 1 to @xmath9 , out to @xmath10 .",
    "these measurements have the potential to help determine the fundamental cosmological parameters governing the universe .",
    "the 2qz will also significantly advance our understanding of the agn / qso phenomenon , by allowing us to carry out statistical studies of large numbers of qso spectra , and also discovering rare and extreme types of agn , for example broad - absorption - line qsos or post - starburst qsos @xcite . as well as qsos",
    ", there are a large number of other interesting sources being discovered including compact narrow - emission - line galaxies , white dwarfs and cataclysmic variables .    in this paper we will concentrate on the statistical measurements of qso clustering .",
    "the basic properties of the 2qz are outlined in section [ sec : survey ] .",
    "we then discuss various measurements of large - scale structure including the correlation function ( section [ sec : xir ] ) and redshift - space distortions ( section [ sec : zspace ] ) .",
    "the 2qz currently ( september 2001 ) contains 20573 qsos below a redshift of @xmath10 .",
    "observations will be completed in january 2002 , by which time close to 25000 qsos will have been observed .",
    "a large fraction of the data is already publicly available ; the 2qz `` 10k catalogue '' @xcite contains spectra of 11000 qsos , and almost 10000 other sources .",
    "the spectra and catalogue are available electronically at http://www.2dfquasar.org . the analysis below mostly concerns this 10k catalogue .",
    "qso candidates were selected as being point sources and bluer than the stellar locus , based on broad band @xmath11 magnitudes from automatic plate measuring ( apm ) facility measurements of uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) photographic plates .",
    "the magnitude limits are @xmath12 .",
    "the survey comprises 30 ukst fields , arranged in two @xmath13 declination strips centred in the south galactic cap ( sgc ) at @xmath14 and the north galactic cap ( ngc ) at @xmath15 with ra ranges @xmath16 to @xmath17 and @xmath18 to @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the completed survey will cover approximately 740 deg@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations have been carried out using the 2df instrument at the aat in conjunction with the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite , as the 2qz and 2dfgrs areas cover the same regions of sky .",
    "spectroscopic data are reduced using the 2df pipeline reduction system @xcite .",
    "the identification of qso spectra and redshift estimation was carried out using the autoz code written specifically for this project .",
    "this program compares template spectra of qsos , stars and galaxies to the observed spectra .",
    "identifications are then confirmed by eye for all spectra .",
    "the mean spectroscopic completeness for the sample is 89 per cent .    the spatial and redshift distribution of qsos is shown in fig [ fig : wedge ] .",
    "at redshifts @xmath21 the decline in qso numbers is due to the increased reddening of qso colours by absorption in the ly@xmath22 forest .",
    "qsos in this region are therefore missed by our colour selection . at low redshifts",
    "we will miss objects in which the host galaxy contributes significantly to the flux , due to both the extended nature of the sources and their redder colours .",
    "an estimate of the survey incompleteness due to the colour selection is given by boyle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) @xcite .",
    "we have measured the redshift space correlation function , @xmath23 , of 2qz qsos , both averaged over the entire sample , and sub - divided into redshift or magnitude intervals .",
    "@xmath23 has been estimated assuming two representative cosmological models ; the @xmath24 einstein - de sitter model ( eds ) and a model with @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we use the minimum variance @xcite correlation function estimator , and details of our method can be found in croom et al .",
    "( 2001 ) @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi]a shows the qso correlation function for eds and @xmath25 universes averaged over @xmath26 , based on the qsos in the 10k catalogue . the amplitude and shape of @xmath23 is comparable to that of local galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xi]b ) .",
    "fitting a standard power law of the form @xmath27 we find that @xmath28 and @xmath29 for an eds cosmology .",
    "the effect of a significant cosmological constant is to increase the separation of qsos , so that in the @xmath25 model the best fit is @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "both these best fit lines are shown in fig [ fig : xi]a .",
    "we then sub - divide the 2qz into five redshift intervals containing approximately equal number of qsos .",
    "the correlation function is measured in each redshift interval separately , and a power law is fit to the result ( assuming the same slope as found from the full sample ) .",
    "the resulting clustering scale lengths are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi]c .",
    "the clustering of qsos is constant as a function of redshift over the entire range probed by the 2qz ( eds ) . in the @xmath25 case",
    "there is a marginal increase of clustering with increasing redshift , but a constant value can not be ruled out . making comparisions to the clustering of high redshift ly - break galaxies @xcite , at @xmath32",
    ", we see that these also have a similar clustering strength to that of the 2qz qsos .",
    "the solid lines in fig . [ fig : xi]c denote the linear theory evolution of clustering .",
    "the data disagrees with the linear theory prediction , implying that qsos must have a redshift dependent bias factor , @xmath33 .",
    "we derive an empirical fit to the bias of the qsos assuming @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the linear growth factor ( dot - dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi]c )",
    ". the best fit values are @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( eds ) and @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "a more detailed analysis is carried out by croom et al .",
    "( 2001 ) @xcite .",
    "we lastly sub - divide our sample into 3 apparent magnitude slices with equal number of qsos in each .",
    "the measured values of @xmath40 as a function of mean apparent magnitude are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi]d",
    ". there is no significant difference between the different magnitude slices , although the brightest qsos do have marginally stronger clustering .",
    "we note that sub - dividing on the basis of apparent magnitude is approximately equvalent to selection relative to @xmath41 due to the extreme luminosity evolution of qsos over the redshift range of our sample @xcite .",
    "by comparing clustering along and across the line of sight , and modelling the effects of peculiar velocities ( both linear and non - linear ) it is possible to detect the geometric distortions present if the wrong cosmological model is assumed when determining the clustering @xcite . at high redshift , the geometric distortion is particularly sensitive to the cosmological constant @xmath4 . in practice , a model which also takes into account linear infall is fit to provide a constraint in the @xmath4 vs. @xmath42 plane .    the qso power spectrum from the 2qz 10k sample , measured along and across the line of sight , @xmath43 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zspace ] . unfortunately the current 2qz data only provides a joint constraint on @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( shading in fig .",
    "[ fig : zspace]b ) .",
    "infact there is also some dependence on the value of the small scale non - linear pair - wise velocity dispersion , @xmath46 . because we are looking at @xmath43 on large scales",
    "this is not a major issue , but the effects of varying the assumed velocity dispersion is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zspace]b .    however",
    ", we can obtain a useful constraint on the cosmological world model by combining the above approach with our knowledge of the linear growth of clustering . by using the value of @xmath45 and the two - point correlation function for nearby galaxies derived from the 2dfgrs @xcite we can determine the clustering of matter at @xmath47 and for a given cosmology we can then derive the clustering of mass as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "comparison to the amplitude of qso clustering then gives the mean value of the qso bias and hence @xmath45 .",
    "this approach gives a differing relation between @xmath49 and @xmath45 ( dotted and dot - dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : zspace]b ) , and thus breaks the degeneracy . the current best fit derived from this method is @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "ths analysis is discussed further in outram et al . , ( 2001 ) @xcite .    with the completion of the 2qz at the end of 2001 , analysis of the complete data",
    "set will produce further constraints on cosmological world models .",
    "this will include different types of analysis than those discussed here , including the gravitational lensing properties of the 2qz qsos .",
    "it is hoped that the 2qz will become a major resource for the astronomical community , particularly when the final data becomes public at the end of 2002 .",
