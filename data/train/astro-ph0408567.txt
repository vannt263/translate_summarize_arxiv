    "ever since eggen , lynden - bell & sandage ( 1962 , hereafter els ) interpreted the correlations between metallicity and kinematics of 221 stars in the solar neighbourhood as evidence in favour of a monolithic collapse formation model of the milky way , the mode of assembly of the milky way has been one of the main goals of observational surveys of the chemistry , age , and kinematics of stars in the galaxy .",
    "soon after the publication of els , it became clear that some data provided challenges to the els interpretation , paving the way to more complex formation scenarios for the milky way .",
    "for example , the properties of the stellar halo , as traced by the globular cluster system , deviate from the trends seen in the sample analyzed by els ( searle & zinn 1978 , hereafter sz ) and have long been viewed as consistent with a formation process that involved the merger of a number of smaller subunits rather than the gradual collapse envisioned by els .",
    "the vigorous observational progress that followed the els and sz papers ( recently reviewed by freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) have led to the development of a milky way formation scenario that borrows from the basic tenets of both the els and sz hypotheses . in this",
    ", the stellar spheroid is built through a number of early mergers , whereas the stellar disk is regarded as the outcome of the smooth , dissipative deposition ( and transformation into stars ) of gas cooling more or less continuously off the intergalactic medium .",
    "although the disk is built smoothly in this scenario , it is not stationary , and may evolve as a result of internal inhomogeneities such as spiral arms and molecular clouds , as well as by the effect of minor mergers with external satellite galaxies .",
    "indeed , the presence of two distinct components in the galactic disk ( the thin and thick disks , gilmore & reid 1983 ) is widely ascribed to the dynamical `` heating '' of an early thin disk by a satellite roughly @xmath2 gyr ago ( quinn & goodman 1986 ; quinn , hernquist & fullagar 1993 ; robin et al .",

    "axis is chosen to coincide with the rotation axis of the disk component .",
    "the orbital plane is initially seen approximately edge - on in the @xmath3-@xmath4 projection and is inclined @xmath5 relative to the plane of the disk . as the orbit of the satellite decays and approaches the disk , it is rapidly brought into the plane of the disk before disruption .",
    "[ figs : orbev ] ]    various versions of this scenario have long guided the interpretation of newer datasets which , thanks to dedicated observing campaigns ; to the availability of accurate distance measurements from hipparcos ; as well as to exquisite spectroscopy possible from 8 - 10 m telescopes , have expanded to include hundreds of stars with reliable three - dimensional kinematics and detailed chemical abundance information .",
    "most of these stars , however , are in the immediate vicinity of the sun , and therefore the analysis suffers from the subtle and inevitable biases that the sun s location in the galaxy brings about",
    ". the bias may be modest if the stellar distribution function is a smooth function of galactic phase - space coordinates ( may & binney 1986 ) , but it may imply severe limitations if a large number of coherent dynamical groups  relicts from past accretion events  populate the galaxy , as these may well be under- or over - represented in the vicinity of the sun .    the relatively quiescent formation scenario of the galaxy described above  the galactic disk is after all the dominant stellar component of the galaxy  has encouraged the interpretation of the abundance patterns of nearby stars in terms of global collapse models where enrichment proceeds according to the general scenario outlined by tinsley ( 1979 ) .",
    "their success in reproducing the correlations between kinematics and chemistry of solar neighbourhood stars notwithstanding , such models have traditionally been less successful at accounting for the sizable scatter around the mean trends shown in the data , as well as by the presence of abundance oddities in stars with otherwise unremarkable kinematics ( carney et al .",

    "1999 ) , where merging is expected to have contributed significantly to the various populations of the galaxy ( see , e.g. , steinmetz & navarro 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , the presence of an old , extended stellar disk component ( such as that hypothesized to be the progenitor of today s thick disk ) is awkward to accommodate in such models , since the dynamical fragility of stars in disk - like orbits seems to preempt an active merging history .",
    "indeed , the presence of old stars in the disk components of the galaxy is often used to argue that the galaxy has not been disturbed by mergers throughout most of its life ( see , e.g. , wyse 2004 ) ; clearly an unusual assembly history in a universe where structure grows hierarchically .",
    "the precise age of the galactic disk components is still somewhat controversial , given that ages of individual stars are notoriously difficult to measure accurately , but the thin disk of the galaxy is known to contain a fair fraction of metal - poor ( and presumably quite old ) stars .",
    "for example , roughly @xmath9 of stars in the dynamically - unbiased catalog of metal - deficient ( [ fe / h ] @xmath10 ) nearby stars compiled by beers et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter b00 ) have thin disk - like angular momenta",
    ".    numerical simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation have suggested a way to reconcile the presence of old , metal - poor disk stars with the hectic merging activity envisioned in hierarchical formation scenarios .",
    "abadi et al . ( 2003a , b ) report , for example , that @xmath11 of dynamically - selected thin - disk stars in their cosmological simulation of the formation of a disk galaxy are actually older than the epoch of the galaxy s last major merger .",
    "essentially all ( @xmath12 ) of these old stars are brought in at late times by satellite galaxies whose orbits are circularized and dragged into the disk by dynamical friction before disruption .",
    "the core of satellites that disrupt after their orbits have been nearly circularized may thus contribute stars to the thin disk component upon disruption .",
    "in contrast , satellites that are disrupted before their orbits are substantially eroded by dynamical friction ( or whose orbits are roughly polar to the disk ) will contribute most of their stars to the spheroidal component .",
    "more massive satellites are likely to see their orbits more severely affected by dynamical friction before disruption ( they are typically denser and thus more resilient to disruption ) , and are therefore likely to shed their stars onto more rotationally supported orbits than those of less massive companions more prone to disruption .",
    "this suggests that broad correlations between metallicity and rotation may arise without the need for progressive in - situ enrichment of gas cooling and settling into the disk . indeed , most metal poor stars in the solar neighbourhood",
    "may actually be the overlapping debris of numerous satellites disrupted in the past .",
    "in such scenario , the trend for rotational support to increase with metallicity would just reflect the mass - metallicity relation of their progenitor galaxies , coupled with the more efficient orbital decay of massive satellites in the potential of the galaxy .",
    "if this scenario is correct , it should be possible to identify at least some of the relicts of such accretion events as coherent groups in phase space .",
    "a number of such kinematically - distinct associations have been recognized in the stellar halo ; for example , the sagittarius dwarf ( ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ) ; the retrograde rotation of halo stars in the direction of the north galactic pole ( majewski 1992 ) ; and the identification of substructure in the outer halo by helmi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "accretion onto the disk has also been recently recognized .",
    "one example is provided by the `` monoceros ring '' of stars in the outer disk of the galaxy , which has been interpreted as material recently stripped from a dwarf galaxy that may still remain hidden in the disk ( yanny et al .",

    "further examples are provided by the `` arcturus stream '' ; a group of stars at the apocenter of their eccentric , disk confined orbits that has been interpreted as debris from the disruption of a satellite in the plane of the galactic disk ( eggen 1971 ; navarro , helmi & freeman 2004 ) ; as well as by the discovery of an unexpected , slowly - rotating component above and below the plane of the disk ( gilmore , wyse & norris 2002 ) .",
    "we examine here the possibility that other solar - neighbourhood stars may have originated from material stripped from disrupted satellites . as with the analysis of the `` arcturus group '' , we shall focus on stars with orbits confined to relatively small excursions from the plane of the disk ( but not necessarily on circular orbits ) and use numerical simulations to motivate and guide the search for common orbital characteristics in catalogs of nearby metal - deficient stars .",

    "we analyze the accretion and disruption of a satellite galaxy in the simulation of the formation of a disk galaxy presented by abadi et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) .",
    "the simulation follows self - consistently the evolution in a @xmath8cdm universe of a small region surrounding a target galaxy , excised from a large periodic box and resimulated at higher resolution preserving the tidal fields from the whole box .",
    "the simulation includes the gravitational effects of dark matter , gas and stars , and follows the hydrodynamical evolution of the gaseous component using the smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique .",
    "dense , cold gas is allowed to turn into stars at rates consistent with the empirical schmidt - like law of kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "the energetic feedback of evolving stars is included as a heating term on the surrounding gas , but its effectiveness in curtailing star formation is low .",
    "the transformation of gas into stars thus tracks closely the rate at which gas cools and condenses at the center of dark matter halos .",
    "details of the simulation are given in abadi et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) .",
    "as discussed by these authors , at @xmath13 the main galaxy resembles more an early - type spiral than the milky way .",
    "although the luminosity of the disk component ( @xmath14 ) and the circular speed at @xmath15 kpc ( @xmath16 km s@xmath17 ) are comparable to those of our galaxy we emphasize that this is _ not _ a model of the milky way , and that our main goal is to understand _ qualitatively _ rather than quantitatively the nature of debris from tidally disrupted satellites .",

    "a possible debris detection strategy would thus be to search samples of nearby stars for groups with : ( i ) modest vertical motions , ( ii ) negligible net galactocentric radial velocity , and ( iii ) common angular momentum , and to probe them for corroborating traits suggestive of a common origin .",

    "( 2002 ) ) , constitute persuasive evidence for the extra - galactic origin of the bright star arcturus and of other members of its namesake group .    on the other hand , for observers located _ between _ the apocenter and pericenter of a well - mixed group the debris would show locally as groups of stars with a rather broad , symmetric ( and at times `` double - humped '' ) distribution of galactocentric radial velocities .",

    "the @xmath0cen group candidates , on the other hand , span a large symmetric range in @xmath72 , from @xmath86 to @xmath83 km s@xmath17 , with no obvious central tendency ( i.e. , few stars near apocenter ) and a velocity dispersion exceeding @xmath87 km s@xmath17 . indeed ,",
    "only three out of thirteen candidates have @xmath74 km s@xmath17 , whereas one would have expected three times as many had their @xmath72 distribution been similar to that of the whole ensemble .    with the obvious caveat that the number of candidates is rather small ,",
    "one is tempted to interpret the broad , roughly symmetric @xmath72 distribution as evidence that some of the candidate stars are part of a dynamically coherent group shed by @xmath0cen s dwarf prior to disruption .",
    "the apocenter of this group is outside the solar circle , and therefore group stars are only seen moving towards apocenter with high positive @xmath72 velocity or coming from the apocenter with high negative @xmath72 .",
    "support for the common origin of this group comes from analyzing the abundances of candidate stars .",
    "[ figs : fehafe ] shows the abundance of @xmath1 elements and iron for stars in the gcclb sample . as is customary ,",
    "the @xmath1-element abundance is expressed as the logarithm of its abundance relative to fe in solar units , [ @xmath1/fe ] , and the iron abundance is given as a logarithmic measure of its ratio to h also in solar units , [ fe / h ] .",
    "open circles correspond to all stars in the gcclb compilation , whereas the filled circles indicate the @xmath0cen group candidates , as in fig .",
    "[ figs : uw ] .",
    "remarkably , the @xmath0cen group candidates are not distributed at random amongst the sample , but rather trace a well - defined narrow track in this plane , spanning a wide range in iron abundance ( @xmath88 [ fe / h ] @xmath89 ) which is consistent with the spread in metallicity measured for individual stars in @xmath0cen ( suntzeff & kraft 1996 ) .",
    "this well defined track in the [ @xmath1/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] plane is roughly consistent with simple one - zone self - enrichment models ( see , e.g. , matteucci & francois 1989 ) , but where pollution by the iron - rich ejecta of type ia supernovae becomes important at lower metallicity than for `` typical '' stars in the halo , where [ @xmath1/fe ] drops precipitously for [ fe / h ] @xmath90 .",
    "intriguingly , two candidate stars appear to deviate from this trend , and are highlighted by starred symbols in fig . [",
    "figs : fehafe ] .",
    "this is consistent with the above interpretation , as these two stars are dynamically quite distinct from the rest ; although they share the angular momentum of @xmath0cen , their low @xmath72 velocity ( @xmath91 km s@xmath17 ) sets them apart from the rest as unrelated stars on much more tightly bound orbits .    the chemical coherence highlighted by the filled symbols in fig .",
    "[ figs : fehafe ] is thus manifest only when stars of coherent kinematics ( i.e. similar @xmath24 and @xmath30 ) are considered part of the group .",
    "overall , this pattern is consistent with that expected for a satellite system that self - enriched to a metallicity of order one - tenth of the sun on a time scale somewhat longer than envisioned for the bulk of metal - poor stars in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "we conclude that the chemical and dynamical coherence of stars in the @xmath0cen group is highly suggestive of a common origin , most likely a single dwarf system that was dragged and disrupted into the disk of the galaxy early during its assembly history .",
    "cen group .",
    "note that these stars delineate a well defined sequence in the abundance ratios that may be interpreted as resulting from a protracted episode of star formation where a system self - enriched to a metallicity of order one - tenth of solar .",
    "two candidate stars deviate from the main trend , and are highlighted with starred symbols . these two stars , however , are kinematically distinct from the rest .",
    "although they share the angular momentum of @xmath0cen , they are at the apocenter of their orbits ( @xmath91 km s@xmath17 ) in sharp contrast with the rest of @xmath0cen group candidates , which are moving through the solar neighbourhood to or from their apocenter at an average radial velocity of @xmath92 km s@xmath17 .",
    "these stars are unlikely to be related to @xmath0cen s progenitor .",
    "[ figs : fehafe ] ]",
    "we use numerical simulations to analyze the dynamical properties of tidal debris stripped from a satellite on a highly eccentric orbit roughly coplanar with the disk of the main galaxy upon disruption . because of the small pericentric radius of the orbit , the stellar component of the satellite is disrupted by the tidal shocks that accompany the last few pericentric passages , splitting the bulk of stars into coherent groups of common energy and angular momentum on eccentric orbits roughly confined to the disk .",
    "observers located between the pericenter and apocenter of such groups would see the debris as stars of common angular momentum but with a wide , symmetric ( and at times `` double - peaked '' ) distribution of galactocentric radial velocities .",
    "a group of stars with these characteristics stands out in catalogs of nearby metal - poor stars and share the peculiar kinematics of the unusual globular cluster @xmath0cen .",
    "these stars orbit the galaxy on retrograde orbits but confined to relatively small vertical excursions from the plane of the disk , and show extremely well - correlated element - to - element abundance ratios .",
    "they span a range in [ fe / h ] comparable to that of individual stars in @xmath0cen , and follow closely the [ @xmath1/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] correlation expected for a simple closed - box self - enrichment model .",
    "the dynamical and chemical coherence of stars in this group are highly suggestive of a common origin , which we ascribe to the dwarf galaxy that brought @xmath0cen into the galactic disk .",
    "the @xmath0cen group thus shares some of the properties of the `` arcturus group '' ; a group of stars of moderate velocity dispersion and singular metal abundance ( eggen 1971 ) , that navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have recently claimed to be part of the debris from another past accretion event .",
    "however , the @xmath0cen and arcturus groups also differ in a number of properties . for example , although arcturus group members have negligible net radial motions and are thus near the apocenter of their orbits , @xmath0cen group stars are passing by the solar neighbourhood at fairly high speeds to or from apocentric radii far outside the solar circle .",
    "in addition , most arcturus group members have highly enhanced [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios relative to solar , and are in this regard similar to the majority of metal - poor stars in the solar neighbourhood ( see figure 3 of navarro et al .",
    "on the other hand , the [ @xmath1/fe ] ratio of @xmath0cen group members approaches the solar value at relatively low metallicity ( [ @xmath1/fe ] @xmath93 at [ fe / h ] @xmath94 ; see fig .",
    "[ figs : fehafe ] ) .",
    "thus , several stars in this group have unusually low [ @xmath1/fe ] enhancement relative to typical halo stars of comparable metallicity .",
    "this is important , as it suggests an `` extra - galactic '' resolution for the puzzle surrounding stars with anomalously low [ @xmath1/fe ] in the solar neighbourhood : namely , all such stars may come from disrupted dwarfs ( carney et al . 1997 ; king 1997 ; hanson et al .",
    "1998 ; fulbright 2002 ) .",
    "indeed , low [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios are consistent with those of stars in the dwarf satellites of the milky way ( draco ; sculptor ; and sagittarius ; see , e.g. , shetrone et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ; bonifacio et al .",
    "2004 ; venn et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the prominence of the arcturus and @xmath0cen groups in samples of metal - deficient stars ( the two combined make up to @xmath95 of the stars in the gcclb sample ) suggests that accretion events have probably contributed a significant number of the metal - deficient stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "these two examples demonstrate that at least some , and perhaps many , old stars on orbits confined to the disk did not form _ in situ _ , but were brought into the galaxy by accretion events .",
    "it is clearly important to search exhaustively for signatures of past accretion events in the solar neighbourhood in order to quantify properly the contribution of tidal debris to the inventory of metal - poor stars in the galaxy , as this may seriously affect the validity and applicability of galactic formation and evolution models .",
    "for example , els - inspired interpretations of the correlation between metallicity and rotational support for nearby metal - poor stars in terms of a global collapse rest on the assumption that their orbits have not evolved drastically over time @xmath96 ( see also bekki & chiba 2000 for further discussion ) .",
    "our comment , on the other hand , refers to all stars in the beers et al .",
    "( 2000 ) sample , i.e. , those with [ fe / h ] @xmath47 . ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "if most metal - poor stars in the solar neighbourhood have been brought into the galaxy by accretion events , a drastically different scenario may be required to accommodate this correlation .",
    "one possibility is that this may just reflect the increasing efficiency of dynamical friction in circularizing the orbits of more massive satellites  the most effective contributors of stars relatively rich in metals .",
    "is it possible that the whole trend seen in fig .",
    "[ figs : fehafe ] is caused by the overlap of stars stripped from numerous satellites , each of which may have self - enriched roughly as a closed box prior to accretion ?",
    "it would be premature to argue that the data is fully consistent with such scenario , but nor is it obviously ruled out by the data .    for example , the scarcity of metal - poor stars with low [ @xmath1/fe ] may be explained by arguing that they originate in the smallest and most metal - poor of all accreted satellites ( i.e. , the likes of sculptor , draco , or the progenitor of @xmath0cen ) .",
    "overall , few stars are locked up in such small satellites , and therefore it is not surprising that they contribute a relatively small fraction of all the metal - deficient stars in the solar neighbourhood . in this interpretation , the main trend in the [ @xmath1/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] plane ( fig .",
    "[ figs : fehafe ] ) is dominated by the enrichment process of the few massive dwarfs whose debris dominates the metal - poor star counts in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "one example would be the progenitor of the arcturus group , which probably self - enriched rapidly to [ fe / h]@xmath97 before disruption , and therefore contributed mostly stars highly enhanced in [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "a number of critical enquiries should be pursued before one may elevate this speculation into a working hypothesis to guide the interpretation of future datasets .",
    "these enquiries will soon become possible , as the completion of large - scale surveys such as those planned by the rave collaboration ( steinmetz et al .",
    "2003 ) or by gaia ( perryman et al . 2001 ) promise to provide a comprehensive appraisal of the importance of kinematical substructure in the dynamics of the galaxy .",
    "detailed abundance studies of stars selected from such surveys to belong dynamically to either the arcturus or @xmath0cen groups may corroborate the `` closed - box '' evolutionary sequence outlined for the progenitors of these stellar groups .",
    "( we note , however , that this may only apply to the low - mass end of accreted dwarfs , as large satellites like , say , the lmc , may themselves have been built through the assembly of smaller subunits . ) the discovery of further dynamically and chemically coherent groups associated with stars of anomalous chemistry in the solar neighbourhood would be especially helpful to confirm the extra - galactic origin of such stars .",
    "finally , ongoing studies of the kinematics of thick disks in external galaxies ( see , e.g. , dalcanton , yoachim & bernstein 2004 ) hold the promise of extending these studies beyond the unique environment of the milky way and to unravel the cosmological role of accretion events in the formation of the various galactic components .",
