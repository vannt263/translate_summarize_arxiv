    "the non - trivial vacuum structure of su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) theory gives rise to regular non - perturbative finite energy solutions , such as magnetic monopoles , multimonopoles and monopole - antimonopole systems .",
    "while spherically symmetric monopoles carry unit topological charge @xcite , monopoles with charge @xmath2 @xcite and monopole - antimonopole systems @xcite are axially symmetric or possess no rotational symmetry at all @xcite .    to any static solution of the ymh equations there corresponds a family of electrically charged solutions @xcite . in the prasad - sommerfield limit",
    "these electrically charged solutions are obtained directly from the electrically neutral solutions via simple scaling relations , by requiring the time component of the gauge field and the higgs field to be parallel @xcite .",
    "bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) monopoles and julia - zee dyons do not admit slowly rotating excitations @xcite .",
    "indeed , monopoles and dyons can not rotate in the sense , that they possess finite angular momentum , since they are globally regular solutions which carry magnetic charge @xcite .",
    "thus monopoles and dyons with higher magnetic charge can not rotate either . whereas bps dyons also have vanishing angular momentum density , non - bps dyons with higher magnetic charge",
    "might possess a finite angular momentum density , yielding a vanishing angular momentum upon integration , though , because of symmetry reasons .",
    "in monopole - antimonopole pairs , on the other hand , the magnetic charge vanishes @xcite . in these axially symmetric solutions the two nodes of the higgs field , representing the location of the magnetic charges ,",
    "are situated symmetrically on the positive and negative @xmath3-axis .",
    "when electric charge is added to both the monopole and antimonopole in the pair , they experience a repulsive force and the poles move further apart @xcite .",
    "more importantly , however , the pair begins to rotate about its symmetry axis , yielding an angular momentum equal to its electric charge , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "thus the presence of electric charge again leads to a finite angular momentum density .",
    "but since the magnetic charge of the pair vanishes , it may rotate , and indeed it must rotate with @xmath4 @xcite .    monopole ",
    "antimonopole pairs can also be formed from doubly charged monopoles and antimonopoles ( @xmath5 ) @xcite . for higher values of @xmath1 , in constrast , a completely different type of solution appears @xcite . here",
    "the higgs field vanishes on a ring centered around the symmetry axis",
    ". therefore we refer to these solutions as vortex rings . adding electric charge to these magnetically neutral solutions",
    "then should yield rotating @xmath5 monopole  antimonopole pairs and rotating vortex rings possessing angular momentum @xmath6 .    when gravity is coupled to ymh theory , gravitating monopoles @xcite , gravitating monopole - antimonopole pairs and gravitating vortex rings arise @xcite . in each case , a branch of gravitating solutions emerges smoothly from the corresponding flat space solution , and extends up to a maximal value of the coupling constant , where , for vanishing higgs self - coupling constant , it merges with a second branch @xcite . for monopoles",
    "this second branch extends only slightly backwards before it merges with the branch of extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes @xcite . for monopole - antimonopole pair solutions and vortex rings , in contrast",
    ", this second branch extends all the way back to vanishing coupling constant , where the solutions shrink to zero size .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath7 , entering the einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) equations , is proportional to the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath8 and the square root of the gravitational constant @xmath9 .",
    "variation of @xmath7 may thus be considered as variation of the gravitational constant @xmath9 along the first branch and as variation of the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath8 along the second branch .",
    "consequently , the higgs field vanishes in the limit @xmath10 on the second branch , and , after scaling the coordinates , the mass and the higgs field with @xmath7 , solutions of einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory are obtained @xcite , which correspond to the lowest mass bartnik - mckinnon ( bm ) solution @xcite or its generalizations @xcite .",
    "when dyons @xcite or electrically charged monopole - antimonopole pair solutions @xcite are coupled to gravity , analogously a corresponding branch of gravitating dyons or electrically charged monopole - antimonopole pair solutions emerges smoothly from the respective flat space solution @xcite .",
    "whereas gravitating dyons again merge with the corresponding branch of extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes at a critical value of the coupling constant @xcite , the critical behaviour for gravitating electrically charged monopole - antimonopole pair solutions could not be resolved previously @xcite .",
    "gravitating spherically symmetric dyons are static in the sense , that their angular momentum density vanishes . in this letter",
    "we show , that axially symmetric gravitating dyons ( @xmath11 are stationary , while they carry no angular momentum .",

    "magnetically neutral solutions possess a finite dipole moment @xcite , which can be obtained from the asymptotic form of the non - abelian gauge field , after transforming to a gauge where the higgs field is constant at infinity , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and they satisfy the relation @xmath88 generalizing the previous relations @xcite .",
    "the full asymptotic expansion will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "gravitating dyons with magnetic charge @xmath89 are spherically symmetric and static @xcite .",

    "@xcite also dyons with higher magnetic charge show a similar @xmath7-dependence : they merge with the corresponding branch of extremal reissner - nordstrm solutions @xcite .",
    "however , numerical accuracy does not allow to definitely conclude , whether a short second branch is present , i.e. , whether @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "we exhibit the scaled mass @xmath93 and the electric charge @xmath81 for dyons with magnetic charge @xmath5 and @xmath94 in figs .  1 .",
    "gravitating dyons with magnetic charge @xmath89 are static , since they have vanishing angular momentum density @xmath95 .",
    "we here demonstrate that gravitating dyons with magnetic charge @xmath2 are stationary but not static .",
    "they possess a finite angular momentum density .",
    "but since their angular momentum density is antisymmetric with respect to reflection , @xmath96 , their angular momentum vanishes . in fig .  2 we exhibit the energy density @xmath97 and the angular momentum density @xmath95 for a typical gravitating dyon with @xmath5 for @xmath98 .",
    "the energy density is toruslike @xcite , but becomes spherical in the limit @xmath99 .",
    "the angular momentum density vanishes both for @xmath100 and @xmath101 . with increasing @xmath7 it increases in magnitude , but is localized in a decreasing region of space .",
    "let us now consider rotating monopole - antimonopole pairs composed of poles of charge @xmath102 .",
    "for these one expects an analogous coupling constant dependence as for static monopole - antimonopole pairs , i.e. , when gravity is coupled , a branch of gravitating monopole - antimonopole pair solutions emerges from the flat space solution , and merges with a second branch of monopole - antimonopole pair solutions at a maximal value of the coupling constant @xmath90 .",
    "the second branch then extends all the way back to @xmath103 . along the second branch , with decreasing @xmath7 ,",
    "the solutions shrink to zero size @xcite . scaling the coordinates and the higgs field with @xmath7 however",
    ", leads to a limiting solution with finite size and finite scaled mass @xmath104 @xcite , representing the lowest bm solution @xcite of eym theory .",
    "the dependence of the rotating monopole - antimonopole pair solutions on the coupling constant @xmath7 has in part been studied before @xcite .",
    "there indeed two branches of solutions were found , however , these were not smoothly connected : at a value @xmath91 the mass of the solutions on both branches agreed , but their angular momenta did not .",
    "thus the existence of further branches was hypothesized .    repeating the numerical study reveals , however , that both branches can be extended beyond @xmath91 , up to a maximal value @xmath90 , where they merge . thus rotating monopole - antimonopole pair solutions",
    "indeed show the expected coupling constant dependence , except that the two branches of solutions cross before they merge .",
    "this is illustrated in figs.1 . in @xcite",
    "the crossing point was interpreted as a critical point @xmath91 .",
    "the angular momentum of the solutions satisfies the relation @xmath4 , since @xmath89 .",
    "the magnetic moment of these solutions is exhibited in fig.3 .    along the two branches ,",
    "the two nodes of the higgs field , which represent the locations of the magnetic poles , move continuously closer together , until they merge at the origin in the eym limit on the second branch .",
    "thus the nodes of the rotating monopole - antimonopole pair solutions also exhibit the same @xmath7 dependence as the nodes of static solutions @xcite .      for static monopole - antimonopole pairs composed of monopoles and antimonopoles of charge @xmath105 @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath7 dependence is completely analogous as for pairs with @xmath89 .",
    "two branches of solutions exist , which merge at a maximal value @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath7-dependence of the two nodes of the solutions was not considered before @xcite .    for rotating monopole - antimonopole pairs",
    "we also obtain two branches of solutions . again",
    "the two branches cross before they merge at a maximal value @xmath90 .",
    "however , when the two nodes of the higgs field are inspected , one finds a surprise .",
    "the nodes merge at the origin at a value @xmath106 .",
    "there the solutions change their character , turning into vortex rings beyond @xmath106 , since their higgs field then vanishes on a ring in the @xmath107-plane .",
    "the nodal ring first increases in size , reaches a maximum at @xmath90 , and then decreases to zero size in the eym limit on the second branch .",
    "the locations of the nodes and the nodal rings are exhibited in fig.3 .",
    "as illustrated , the nodes of the static solutions possess an analogous @xmath7-dependence .    for @xmath108 ,",
    "the energy density of the solutions on the first branch consists of two tori , located symmetrically with respect to the @xmath107-plane , whereas for @xmath109 , the energy density is a single torus , as illustrated in fig .  4 .",
    "the figure also shows that the angular momentum density of the respective solutions is always symmetrical with respect to the @xmath107-plane .    when @xmath94 , already the static solutions correspond to vortex ring solutions @xcite . like these ,",
    "the rotating vortex ring solutions possess two branches , merging at @xmath90 . as seen in figs .",
    "1 and 3 , the mass , charge and magnetic moment exhibit an analogous @xmath7 dependence for these rotating vortex ring solutions as for the rotating @xmath89 and @xmath5 solutions .",
    "the nodal ring continuously decreases in size along both branches , shrinking to zero size in the eym limit .",
    "we have constructed stationary dyons and rotating monopole - antimonopole pairs and vortex rings in eymh theory .",
    "gravitating dyons can not rotate , since they carry magnetic charge @xcite .",
    "we have shown , that gravitating dyons with magnetic charge @xmath110 , however , are not static but stationary , possessing finite angular momentum density and a non - diagonal metric ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "electrically charged monopole - antimonopole pairs as well as ( magnetically neutral ) vortex rings , on the other hand , must rotate with angular momentum @xmath6 . for monopole - antimonopole pairs , consisting of singly charged magnetic poles , we have resolved the critical behaviour , by showing that the two branches of solutions cross before they merge . the same feature is present for rotating monopole - antimonopole pairs with @xmath0 and rotating vortex rings .",
    "interestingly , for monopole - antimonopole pairs , consisting of doubly charged magnetic poles , we have observed a transition to vortex rings at a value @xmath106 on the first branch .",
    "the transition value depends on the amount of electric charge present and thus on the rotation .    for the dyons , monopole - antimonopole pair solutions and vortex rings presented here , we have restricted the integers @xmath27 and @xmath1 in the general ansatz for the matter fields to @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the solutions thus represent only the simplest types of eymh solutions . for larger values of @xmath27 and @xmath1 new types of static solutions appear @xcite , representing e.g.  monopole - antimonopole chains and multi - vortex solutions .",
    "study of their stationary or rotating generalizations may lead to further surprises .",
