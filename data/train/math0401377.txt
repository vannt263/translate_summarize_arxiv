    "our approach is to define @xmath23 from the moduli spaces of anti - self - dual instantons on @xmath24 with lagrangian boundary condition in @xmath21 , i.e.  from the gauge equivalence classes of connections @xmath25 satisfying the boundary value problem @xmath26 note that the boundary condition is nonlocal : it firstly asserts the local condition that the connection is flat on each boundary slice ; but secondly its holonomy has to vanish around those loops in @xmath14 that are contractible in @xmath17 , which is a global condition .    in @xcite",
    "we describe this approach in full detail and we establish the elliptic theory for this boundary value problem ( allowing for a larger class of lagrangian boundary conditions ) .",
    "fix @xmath22 , then every @xmath27-solution is gauge equivalent to a smooth solution and the following analogue of uhlenbeck compactness is true : every sequence of solutions with locally @xmath16-bounded curvature is gauge equivalent to a sequence that contains a @xmath28-convergent subsequence .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of bubbling : what happens if a sequence of solutions has bounded energy @xmath29 but its curvature @xmath30 is not locally @xmath16-bounded for any @xmath22 ?    in the case of a @xmath31-manifold without boundary this question is answered by the compactification of the moduli space of anti - self - dual instantons leading to the donaldson invariants of smooth @xmath31-manifolds  @xcite and to the instanton floer homology groups of closed @xmath5-manifolds  @xcite .",

    "the anti - self - dual instantons on @xmath32 are obtained by rescaling the connections near the bubbling point @xmath36 .",

    "it was conjectured that there is an energy quantization for the limit objects  anti - self - dual instantons on the half space .",
