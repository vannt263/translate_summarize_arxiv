    "cyg x-3 is a high - mass x - ray binary with a wolf - rayet ( wr ) donor @xcite and a very short orbital period of @xmath3 h. its distance is @xmath49 kpc @xcite . in spite of its discovery already in 1966 @xcite ,",
    "cyg x-3 remains poorly understood . in particular , the nature of its compact object remains uncertain , due to the lack of reliable determination of the mass functions and inclination ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "however , the presence of a black hole is favoured by considering the x - ray and radio emission and the bolometric luminosity ( @xcite , hereafter sz08 , @xcite , hereafter szm08 ) .",
    "also , @xcite have shown that the differences in the form of the x - ray spectra of cyg x-3 from those of confirmed black - hole binaries can be accounted for by compton scattering in a cloud formed by the stellar wind from the companion .",
    "cyg x-3 is a persistent x - ray source with a typical x - ray luminosity of @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "its x - ray spectra have been classified into five states by szm08 , who have also quantified their correlations with the radio emission .",
    "its high - energy @xmath1-ray emission has been discovered by the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) and by _ agile _ in the soft spectral states ( @xcite , hereafter flc09 ; @xcite ) .",
    "later detections by the lat and _ agile _ are presented by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , hereafter b12 .",
    "cyg x-3 shows pronounced flux modulation on the 4.8 h period , discovered in x - rays @xcite and in infrared @xcite .",
    "both periodicities are most likely related to the strong stellar wind from the wr star ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the x - ray flux minima correspond to the maximum absorption in the line of sight around the superior conjunction ( the compact object behind the wr star ) .",
    "the x - ray period has been found to increase @xcite .",
    "the period increase of @xmath7 yr@xmath6 is likely to be due to the loss of angular momentum through the wind mass loss @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present a detailed study of the dependence of the form of the x - ray orbital modulation on energy , using data from _ swift _ , _ integral _ and _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "we also study the dependence of the modulation on the x - ray spectral state , as well as obtaining x - ray modulation profiles for intervals simultaneous with the detections of high - energy @xmath1-rays .",
    "the @xmath1-ray emission was found to be also strongly modulated on the orbital period , but with the maxima and minima approximately corresponding to the x - ray minima and maxima , respectively ( flc09 ) .",
    "this phase reversal has been interpreted as due to anisotropy of compton scattering of the stellar emission by relativistic electrons in the jet @xcite .",
    "the jet emission certainly extends to lower energies , and , using the model of @xcite , the hard x - rays from the jet are also predicted to have the maximum around the superior conjunction ( @xcite , hereafter z12 ) , i.e. , shifted with respect to the observed x - ray modulation by a half of the period .",
    "a measurement of the energy - dependent orbital modulation up to hard x - rays simultaneous with the @xmath1-ray emission can then constrain the x - ray contribution of the jet .",

    "( _ cgro _ ) .",
    "we have also studied maxi @xcite data . however , the exposure of a single data point for those data is 1.5 h , which is @xmath23 and much longer than any orbital bin we use .",
    "thus , we do not use those data for studying orbital modulation in cyg x-3 .",
    "we note those data also provide us with a hard - state condition , of the 24 kev photon flux",
    "@xmath24 @xmath11 s@xmath6 , approximately equivalent to the asm 35 kev count rate @xmath25 s@xmath6 .",
    "we performed analyses including all of the asm data and similarly with all of the bat data , as well as some subsets of each .",
    "first , we use a hard - state criterion of the daily - averaged 35 kev asm count rate @xmath26 s@xmath6 , corresponding to @xmath185 kev@xmath14 kev @xmath11 s@xmath6 , to the left of the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ correlation ] . as the soft - state criterion",
    ", we use the daily - averaged 1450 kev bat flux of @xmath27 kev @xmath11 s@xmath6 , i.e. , below the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ correlation ] .",
    "our intermediate state corresponds to both fluxes being above these boundaries , i.e. , in the upper right corner of fig .",
    "[ correlation ] .",
    "the soft - state criterion corresponds to the intervals of mjd 5374653896 , 5391354138 , 5420454252 , 5444554470 , 5454854642 , 5474854818 , 5498055044 , 5508055103 , 5532255349 and 5558455645 ( determined using a 5-d running average in order to reduce the effect of fluctuations ) .",
    "for epochs after the end day of our bat data , we have applied the corresponding criterion for the public 1550 kev bat data .",
    "we also use data from intervals corresponding to the detected high - energy @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "currently , they are mjd 5456654647 ( b12 ) , 5475054820 ( flc09 ) , 5482154850 ( b12 ) , 5499055045 ( flc09 ) , 5532455326 ( b12 ) , 5534355345 ( @xcite ; b12 ) and 5558655610 , 55642 - 55644 @xcite .",
    "all those periods correspond to the soft state as defined above , i.e. , below the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ correlation ] , see flc09 and b12 .",
    "thus , the appearance of @xmath1-ray emission corresponds to a marked change of the form of the soft / hard x - ray correlation . combining the results from _",
    "fermi _ lat and _ agile _ , it appears likely that all low hard - flux intervals are also associated with some high - energy @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "cyg x-3 has an orbital period that is increasing with time .",
    "thus , we use a quadratic ephemeris , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the time of a @xmath30-th occurrence of a zero orbital phase ( presumably related to the superior conjunction ) since the reference time , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the period at @xmath31 , @xmath33 is the period derivative , and @xmath34 is the period at @xmath29 .",
    "the ephemeris ( in utc ) of @xcite is @xmath35 , \\ , p_0=0.19968443\\,{\\rm d},\\ , c=5.75\\times 10^{-11}\\,{\\rm d}. \\label{singh}\\ ] ] an updated ephemeris taking into account _ suzaku _ observations ( s. kitamoto , private communication ) is @xmath36 , \\",

    "we note that these ephemerides of cyg x-3 use the template of @xcite , which is defined numerically by their table 2 .",
    "that template has the minimum at the phase @xmath380.97 instead of 1.0 ( or , equivalently , phase 0.0 ) .",
    "thus , minima at phases @xmath39 obtained by us do not indicate a discrepancy with respect to previous results .",
    "we also correct the light curves for barycentric delays .    we need to properly average the folded light curves , [ @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the average count rate of the observation with the mid - time of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is its measurement error . one issue to consider is the large dynamic range of the flux variability of cyg x-3 , which is almost two orders of magnitude ( see fig .  [ correlation ] ) .",
    "thus , linearly - averaged modulation profiles are strongly biased by those at highest flux states . using flux logarithms can , in principle , somewhat alleviate this problem , as it strongly reduces the dynamic range used in summation .",
    "however , this requires removal of all negative flux measurements . for a weak signal , this introduces a strong bias against the minima of the modulation .",
    "we found that this effect strongly suppresses the depth of the modulation at energies @xmath45 kev .    on the other hand ,",
    "orbital modulation acts on a signal with a local flux level , the level being governed by the source aperiodic variability .",
    "the periodic and aperiodic variabilities are largely independent of each other .",
    "thus , in order to effectively reduce the large amplitude of the underlying aperiodic flux variability , we calculate a running average , averaging all observations within some @xmath46 of a given observation time , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of data points satisfying the above condition on @xmath49 . then , we renormalize both @xmath42 and @xmath44 by dividing each by @xmath50 ( so @xmath51 remain unchanged ) . in this way ,",
    "effects of the aperiodic long - term variability on time scales @xmath52 are removed . in the case of measurements equally spaced at a time interval of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the number of bins per period at which the folded light curve is calculated , using @xmath55",
    "would optimally remove the effect of long - term aperiodic variability .",
    "however , our measurements do not satisfy this criterion , and are occasionally sparsely and unevenly spaced .",
    "then , the shorter the @xmath56 , the worse the statistics on which the running average is based . in the extreme case of no other measurements within @xmath46 from a given observation time ,",
    "@xmath42 would be reset to unity , and such a point would falsely reduce the actual orbital modulation .",
    "thus , in our method , we reject points for which the running average is based on @xmath57 points .",
    "we have tested this method for our data , and have found that @xmath58 d ( @xmath59 ) is approximately the shortest interval for which the running average is estimated with good statistics and only a small fraction of points have @xmath57 .",
    "namely , @xmath60 , and the fraction of the rejected points are ( @xmath61 , 0.02 ) , ( @xmath62 , 0.04 ) , for the asm and bat data , respectively .",
    "we thus use the above value of @xmath56 hereafter .",
    "another issue here is related to aperiodic short time - scale variability on time scales shorter than the length of an orbital bin , which effect we also would like to remove .",
    "therefore , we pre - average the light curves on real - time intervals with the length equal to the bin size , @xmath63 , where @xmath54 is the number of phase bins per orbit .",
    "we obtain local averages of the renormalized ( see above ) flux and its error , which we denote as @xmath64 , @xmath65 , respectively , where @xmath66 is the number of the phase bin and @xmath67 is the number of the time bin ( counted from the start time of a given data set ) contributing to the @xmath66-th phase bin .",
    "this method was applied in studying periodic variability of cyg x-1 by @xcite .",
    "it also partly removes a bias on folded averages due to a non - uniform coverage , e.g. , due to a large number of points during one time interval and a low number of points during another , with both contributing to the same phase bin , @xmath66 .",
    "without pre - averaging , the former would have much higher weight than the latter , even if all measurement were relatively accurate .",
    "the pre - averaging does not have a major effect in the case of cyg x-3 due to its very short orbital period ( resulting in rather few points per a @xmath63 time interval ) , as well as for asm and bat data , which have relatively uniform coverage .",
    "still , this is the statistically correct procedure , resulting , in particular , in correctly estimated uncertainties of the folded and averaged light curves .    in final averaging",
    ", we use weights given by inverse squares of the uncertainties , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of time bins contributing to the @xmath66-th phase bin .",
    "the error of the weighted average is estimated from the variance , @xmath70 , @xmath71    we fit the obtained folded / averaged light curves by a simple model of absorption / scattering in a spherically symmetric stellar wind .",
    "a commonly - used wind velocity profile from a massive star ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the resulting electron density are , respectively , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the distance from the centre of the donor of the radius @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the terminal velocity , @xmath76 parametrizes the wind acceleration , @xmath77 is the total mass - loss rate , @xmath78 is the proton mass , @xmath79 is the mean electron molecular weight , and @xmath80 is the h fraction . a small correction due to velocity reaching the sound speed rather than being null at the stellar surface has been neglected .    assuming the opacity for a given photon energy is a spatially independent constant times the density ( as is the case , e.g. , for compton scattering or for bound - free absorption with a constant ionization coefficient ) , the optical depth is an integral over the photon path , @xmath67 @xcite , @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the compton cross section ( including its klein - nishina decline ) , @xmath84 is a photoionization cross section per electron , @xmath85 is a fiducial electron density at @xmath86 under the assumption of @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the orbital separation . for a circular orbit and assuming the radiation originating at the compact object location , @xmath73 is related to @xmath67 by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the binary inclination and @xmath91 is the orbital phase ( defined as @xmath92 , @xmath93 at the superior and inferior conjunction , respectively ) , see fig .  1 in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath95 , @xmath96 which is is equivalent to equation ( 8) of @xcite .    in compton scattering",
    ", a photon removed from one line of sight appears in a different one .",
    "photons scattered away from directions with high @xmath97 preferentially leave the system close to the directions with low @xmath97 . also , the photon distribution will be a function of the angle with respect to the normal to the binary plane .",
    "it is possible to model this effect quantitatively in a more detailed treatment , e.g. , using a monte carlo method .",
    "such method was used by @xcite , who , however , presented their results for @xmath98 only ( and for isotropic wind ) . however , the wind density distribution in cyg x-3 is certainly not isotropic , but instead with a strong focusing towards the compact object @xcite , and the wind structure is affected by irradiation from the x - ray source . taking into account these complications is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we therefore make a simplifying assumption ( as in @xcite ) that a scattering removes the photon from the line of sight and neglect photons scattered into it .",
    "this allows us to fit the observed phase - dependent fluxes by @xmath99 , \\label{flux}\\ ] ] with @xmath100 , @xmath90 , @xmath76 , the offset phase , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 being the model free parameters .",

    "the separation , @xmath88 follows from the total mass of the system .",

    "we see that that curve has the minimum at @xmath128 instead of 0.95 found for the treatment of section [ models ] .",

    "furthermore , the red points have a much flatter and more scattered top part ( similar to the profile shown in @xcite ) .",
    "this difference is mostly due to renormalizing the light curve w / r to the running average . the profile without it is strongly dominated by the brightest states ( as pointed out in section [ models ] ) .",
    "then , fluctuations of those dominant states have a strong effect .",
    "on the other hand , our profile , shown by the blue triangles , is evenly averaged over all flux states .",

    ", the gbm curve has multiple sharp peaks .",
    "we note that the orbital profile for cyg x-1 shown in @xcite also has much stronger sharp features than the corresponding 1550 kev bat profile presented by @xcite .",

    "since the obtained statistical errors are very small , a measure of the uncertainty is provided by the differences between the values for the two models .",

    "the 100 kev model is relatively similar to that at 0.2 gev , though somewhat shifted to higher phases ( z12 ) .",
    "these jet modulation profiles are shifted in phase with respect to those observed in x - rays , and have the maximum around the superior conjunction .",
    "we compare then the predicted modulation of the jet spectral component with that observed at 60150 kev , red symbols .",
    "this profile has been obtained by averaging the bat 100150 kev profile with the _ integral _",

    "we note that @xcite have determined the location of the @xmath1-ray emitting region at a distance @xmath150 along the jet originating at the compact object",
    ". then , x - ray emission from the jet would be much less absorbed by the wind than that originating at the compact object .",
    "furthermore , if the jet x - ray emission were stronger in the soft state then the modulation amplitude would then decrease .",
    "instead , we see in fig .",
    "[ states ] that the modulation depth either in the soft state or for the data simultaneous with the observed @xmath1-ray emission is basically the same as in the hard state , during which there is no detectable jet contribution .",
    "we note that the modulation pattern of the jet 100 kev emission can be flatter than that shown in fig .",
    "[ fermi_hardx ] due to the electron cooling slower than at @xmath2 gev , causing the 100-kev emission region along the jet to be more extended than that in high - energy @xmath1-rays .",

    "thus , based on figs .",
    "[ states][fermi_hardx ] ( also section [ integral ] below ) , we see no indication of a contribution from the low - energy tail of the @xmath1-ray emission . that emission has to have a low - energy cutoff above the hard x - ray range . indeed , the jet models with the minimum lorentz factors of the accelerated electrons of 13001500 , which are shown by the blue curves in figs .",

    "the low 1450 kev state corresponds to the soft state as defined in section [ monitoring ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t : abs ]    we see that the total electron column density is @xmath152 @xmath153 , which corresponds to the difference in the average thomson optical depth between the two phase intervals of @xmath154 .",
    "this is in agreement with @xmath155 found from fitting the orbital modulation profiles ( section [ lc ] ) .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath156 erg cm s@xmath6 correspond to moderate ionization .",
    "we can notice that the models do not fit the smeared edges clearly seen around @xmath22 kev , which are apparently due to absorption by h - like fe in a very strongly ( but not fully ) ionized phase of the wind , which we do not model here . using the definition of @xmath157 , the characteristic distance of the ionized medium is @xmath158 , which , for the fitted values of @xmath157 and @xmath159 is @xmath160 cm .",
    "this is of the order of the orbital separation , @xmath88 , as expected .",
    "thus , the fitted model is consistent with bound - free absorption taking place in the stellar wind .",
    "we note that the fitted parameters do not form monotonic sequences with the increasing state number .",
    "this appears to be due to the limited observation exposures .",
    "then , the two sub - states of a given state are not true averages , but are affected by variability taking place during the used observations .    in fig .",
    "[ f:45 ] , we show the inferior and superior spectra for the states 45 .",
    "we can see that due to the short exposures , the intrinsic variability is apparently comparable to the orbital modulation , especially for the spectra of the state 4 , which have the superior - phase fluxes at @xmath161 kev higher than those of the inferior phases , contrary to the expectations for long - term averages .",
    "we have studied orbital modulation of x - rays from cyg x-3 . using the data from the detectors asm , pca and hexte of _ rxte _ , bat of _ swift _ , and isgri of _ integral _ , we have found that the modulation depth at @xmath162 kev decreases with the photon energy .",
    "the decrease is too fast to be accounted for by the klein - nishina decrease of the compton cross section with energy .",
    "as we confirm by fitting the pca / hexte data , the energy dependence requires the presence of a moderately ionized absorber , with the ionization coefficient of @xmath163 erg cm s@xmath6 .",
    "we have also found a decrease of the depth of the modulation at @xmath164 kev , which is probably due to the re - emission of the absorbed continuum in soft x - ray lines by the wind .    given that we use the data accumulated over long time , we determine the energy - dependent folded and averaged light curves with high accuracy .",
    "the modulation profiles are not consistent with a spherically symmetric wind .",
    "the measured detailed shapes of the orbital modulation and their photon - energy dependence can serve for determination of the wind structure in future work .",
    "also , the energy dependence of the modulation depth at low energies can be further studied using spectra from detectors sensitive at soft x - rays .    assuming that the modulation is from wind absorption , the phase of the flux minimum corresponds to the maximum optical depth through the wind , which is then close to the superior conjunction . on the other hand ,",
    "high - energy @xmath1-rays detected from cyg x-3 by _ fermi _ are found to have an orbital modulation shifted by about a half of the period with respect to that of the x - rays ( flc09 ) .",
    "this pattern has been interpreted as due to anisotropy of scattering of stellar photons by relativistic electrons in the jet by @xcite . as calculated by z12",
    ", the jet emission at hard x - rays has the modulation pattern almost the same as that in the gev range .",
    "thus , the jet x - ray contribution can potentially be measured by determining the orbital - modulation profiles at hard x - rays .",
    "we have performed such study , and have found no presence of an x - ray modulation pattern different from the standard one , i.e. , with the minimum around the superior conjunction , up to @xmath0100 kev .",
    "this implies that an x - ray jet contribution is weak up to at least that energy and the jet component has to have a low - energy cutoff .",
    "this is consistent with the x - ray spectral measurements taken during periods of @xmath1-ray emission , which do not show a hint of a jet component up to comparable energies ( z12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this constraint is satisfied by two among the models presented in z12 , those with the minimum lorentz factors of the accelerated electrons of 1300 and 1500 .",
