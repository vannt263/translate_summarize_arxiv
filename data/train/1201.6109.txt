    "nucleation and subsequent evolution of vacuum bubbles are very interesting issues in gravity , field theory , and cosmology .",
    "we know that our universe experiences accelerated expansion and this state may be described by a positive cosmological constant .",
    "in addition , we know that our universe had experienced a stage of inflation",
    ". the primordial inflation can be described by the existence of a false vacuum in a potential of a field and this necessarily requires a phase transition of the field from the false vacuum to the current true vacuum . in this context ,",
    "the nucleation and evolution of vacuum bubbles are quite natural to introduce .",
    "in addition , such a study of vacuum bubbles can be interesting and important .",
    "the primordial inflation of the current universe will probably be described by a potential with some fields that causes inflation @xcite .",
    "one of the important points of consensus is that the phase transition that finishes the primordial inflation seems to be slow - rolling , not the first order phase transition @xcite . in other words",
    ", it is difficult to explain the ending of inflation by the nucleation and percolation of true vacuum bubbles , since the inflating universe quickly expands , so that bubbles in general can not percolate sufficiently @xcite .",
    "although we know this pessimistic information , the study of bubble nucleation and dynamics is still quite important .",
    "there are at least two main reasons why .    1 .",
    "* cosmic landscape and multiverse : * string theory requires moduli stabilization and this may be possible by flux compactification @xcite .",
    "the flux compactification can generate a huge number of different vacua @xcite , the so - called cosmic landscape @xcite .",
    "if eternal inflation happens , then all vacua can be populated by first order phase transitions ( quantum tunneling ) and each bubble will form a pocket universe . the totality of pocket universes in the eternally inflating background is called the multiverse . in the multiverse and cosmic landscape , study of the nucleation and subsequent dynamics of vacuum bubbles",
    "is illuminated again .",
    "2 .   * in the context of thermal inflation : * after the primordial inflation ended , some unnecessary massive particles can be overproduced @xcite .",
    "such massive particles should disappear , and this may be possible by introducing thermal inflation . in many phenomenological models of thermal inflation",
    ", it will be ended by the first order phase transition , not the second order phase transition @xcite .",
    "therefore , our universe may have some signs of the first order phase transition , bubble nucleation , and bubble percolation .    the bubble nucleating process including gravitation was first studied by coleman and deluccia @xcite .",
    "if we include non - minimal coupling effects that can be motivated from string theory , then possible vacuum transitions can be complicated @xcite .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the bubble including gravitation can be approximated by the thin - wall approximation @xcite .",
    "however , the thin - wall approximation itself is an approximation and hence it may lose dynamics at the transition region . the related study beyond the thin - wall approximation was studied by numerical method @xcite@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on bubble collision issues .",
    "this issue has a long history .",
    "first , without considering gravitation , there were some studies using analytic methods or numerical methods @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting points of colliding bubbles is that the colliding bubble may induce a vacuum transition @xcite or a production of particles @xcite using the colliding energy .",
    "second , including gravitation , it is highly non - trivial to study the dynamics .",
    "we may use the thin - wall approximation @xcite@xcite . in the study of freivogel , horowitz , and shenker @xcite ( for more advanced review , see @xcite ) , they discussed two colliding true vacuum bubbles in the de sitter background : one is flat and the other is anti de sitter .",
    "the analysis in itself is very concise and important , but this may not be able to describe the dynamics of fields on the colliding walls .",
    "for example , this can not describe the vacuum transition behaviors .",
    "hence , we may need further numerical studies .",
    "there were some numerical studies of bubble collisions with gravitation .",
    "very recently , johnson , peiris , and lehner @xcite succeeded in studying bubble collisions with gravitation beyond the thin - wall approximation .",
    "they assumed hyperbolic symmetry from the birkhoff - like theorem of colliding bubbles and assumed initial data from the coleman - deluccia type solutions .",
    "they could solve einstein and field equations numerically and observe and report on symmetric / asymmetric bubble collisions and vacuum transitions .    in this paper",
    ", our study can be an alternative approach to the problem using the double - null formalism @xcite@xcite ( note that , @xcite studied @xmath0-dimensional anti de sitter bubble collisions for different purposes ) .",
    "we can list possible differences with the previous studies :    1 .",
    "* symmetry * : when two bubbles are colliding and there are no other perturbations that disturb bubble collisions , then we can assume the hyperbolic symmetry .",
    "however , if many bubbles collide and the background is very complicated , then the birkhoff - like theorem can be highly non - trivial . for the multi - bubble colliding case @xcite",
    ", the spherical symmetry can be a simplified model ; also , it may be useful to try to extend the symmetry to be not only hyperbolic , but also planar . 2 .",
    "* beyond the coleman - deluccia conditions * : at once we fix a certain symmetry ( spherical , hyperbolic , or planar ) , we can assign various initial conditions for the field within the symmetry .",
    "these initial conditions can come from the coleman - deluccia solution , but it is not necessary in general , around the large wall of a spherical bubble , one can approximate de sitter , flat , or anti de sitter . in these limits , we can justify hyperbolic slices from spherical slices .",
    "the planar or hyperbolic symmetry can be the best trial for general spherical bubble collisions beyond the coleman - deluccia conditions : we can try to see qualitative results and we can choose a certain symmetry by a practical way .",
    "the authors thank to a referee to point this out . ] .",
    "the coleman - deluccia solution assumes @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "therefore , their solutions are de sitter , minkowski , or anti de sitter .",
    "then the initial tension and the initial size of the bubble are already fixed . however , in general , bubbles can be massive and hence the tension and size can be free parameters @xcite , although the probability of the bubble can be reduced .",
    "it is reasonable that if a massive bubble is nucleated in the de sitter background , then the causal future of the massive bubble can see the effect of the mass , while the causal past may not notice such behavior @xcite@xcite . in the double - null coordinates , it is very easy to implement this kind of massive thick - wall conditions .",
    "* causal structure * : the double - null formalism does not have coordinate singularities in general , since it does not use the coordinate time .",
    "in addition , the double - null coordinate preserves causality .",
    "therefore , it is easy to draw causal structures for complicated cases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : mod ] , we discuss our model for bubble collisions in the double - null formalism with spherical , planar , and hyperbolic symmetry . in section  [ sec : var ] , we show various phenomena of bubble collisions : bubble percolation , dynamics of bubble walls , and vacuum destabilization",
    ". finally , in section  [ sec : dis ] , we summarize our results .",

    "figure  [ fig : bubbles ] shows general motivations of each symmetries .",
    "when vacuum bubbles are colliding and percolated , there can be a certain true vacuum bubble that is surrounded by a false vacuum region , where the outside of the false vacuum region is already transited to the true vacuum ( left ) .",
    "we may be able to approximate such a situation by an in - going false vacuum bubble and an out - going true vacuum bubble with spherical symmetry ( middle ) .",
    "in addition , if we focus on the collision of two vacuum bubbles ( red square in left ) , the colliding region locally looks like two walls colliding ( right ) .",
    "such walls can be approximated by the planar symmetry or the hyperbolic symmetry .      to give the proper initial conditions , first we have to understand the value of metric ansatz in the static limit . for spherical and hyperbolic cases",

    "therefore , for the de sitter region , @xmath65 contours are always space - like . however , inside of the anti de sitter region , the signature of @xmath65 changed .",
    "after @xmath65 changes the signature two times ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) , eventually @xmath65 decreases to zero .",
    "this whole smooth evolution of the bubble collision and the formation of big crunch singularity are possible due to the numerical calculations .",
    "we summarized in figure  [ fig : asy ] .",
    "this is the advanced version of the previous work @xcite .",
    "the left bubble is de sitter ( in principle , minkowski is possible ) .",
    "the left bubble is collided into the right anti de sitter bubble .",
    "the wall moves in a time - like direction , is biased to the left direction , and eventually becomes parallel to the null direction ; the tension via the difference of vacuum energy is larger for the anti de sitter side and the speed of the wall will eventually approach the speed of light .",
    "the future infinity of the left side is space - like ( for minkowski , it should be null ) .",
    "there is a future infinity on the wall , and the wall will touch the future infinity of the left side .",
    "when the wall touches the future infinity of the left side , the wall may or may not generate a cauchy horizon ; this depends on initial conditions .",
    "however , at least in the data of figure  [ fig : asy_hype_wider ] , we can see that _ there should be a cauchy horizon _ in the anti de sitter side ( green dotted line ) because of two reasons : ( 1 ) the wall almost moves in the left - going null direction and ( 2 ) the right side of the wall is approximately pure anti de sitter as time goes on , and therefore , the blue curve ( @xmath170 horizon ) should be parallel to the null direction .",
    "therefore , the wall and the @xmath170 horizon will not meet each other , and hence , there should be a cauchy horizon for the anti de sitter side .",
    "we also notice the bousso wedges , that implies the direction where @xmath65 increases . due to the horizons",
    ", the bousso wedges are changed .",
    "there are two main differences between the thin - wall approximation @xcite and our numerical studies :    1 .",
    "the crossing point of two horizons ( @xmath169 and @xmath170 ) can happen before the causal future of the bubble collision , while this was not allowed by the thin - wall approximation .",
    "this is not strange , because the horizons are dynamically deformed _ on the wall _ and connected between de sitter and anti de sitter regions .",
    "2 .   the future infinity can have the _ cauchy horizon _ as we have commented .",
    "however , the time parameter @xmath65 will diverge on the wall when the wall touches the future boundary .",
    "therefore , in terms of the analytic coordinates of the anti de sitter side , they should be identified to the time - like @xmath173 boundary ( gray diagrams beyond the cauchy horizon in figure  [ fig : asy ] ) , although we can not determine beyond the cauchy horizon from the past data .      finally , we focus on the vacuum destabilization to deeper vacuum by bubble collisions .",

    "in this paper , we studied bubble collisions with gravitation by numerical calculations .",
    "we used the double - null formalism to implement numerical simulations .",
    "we used three types of symmetries : spherical , planar , and hyperbolic .",
    "three kinds of symmetries can be qualitatively useful in various situations during the first order phase transition ( figure  [ fig : bubbles ] ) . in this discussion",
    ", we will summarize our results .",
    "first , we tested bubble percolation by bubble collisions .",
    "after bubbles collided , the false vacuum region disappeared and two true vacuum regions are emersed . for the spherical symmetric case , it will eventually induce a black hole in a true vacuum background ( figure  [ fig : causal1 ] ) . for the planar or hyperbolic symmetric case ,",
    "two bubbles are emersed ( left of figure  [ fig : causal2 ] )",
    ". however , as tension increases , if the wall is not sufficient to push the false vacuum region , then two walls may not be able to meet ( right of figure  [ fig : causal2 ] ) .",
    "second , we tested bubble collisions with different field values to see the dynamics of bubble walls .",
    "for symmetric cases , the collided wall moves symmetrically and the wall will touch the future infinity between two true vacuum regions ( figure  [ fig : causal3 ] ) . for asymmetric cases ,",
    "the wall is biased due to the difference of pressures .",
    "the interesting example is the collision of the de sitter vacuum and the anti de sitter vacuum , and the causal structure is analyzed in figure  [ fig : asy ] .    finally , we tested vacuum destabilization due to the bubble collisions . for the spherical symmetric case , the deeper vacuum region can be outside of the event horizon ( left of figure  [ fig : causal4 ] ) .",
    "when we compare this to figure  [ fig : causal1 ] , we can notice that this can give a significant difference for outside observers .",
    "for the hyperbolic symmetric case , the deeper vacuum region is expanded over the null directions and there will be a space - like big crunch singularity ( right of figure  [ fig : causal4 ] ) .    there were a number of previous studies on bubble collisions , and this paper can confirm these studies .",
    "in addition , there are mainly new contributions provided by this paper .    * the spherical symmetric bubble collision ( including black hole formation ) was studied numerically with gravitation ( figure  [ fig : per_sphe ] and left of figure  [ fig : dee ] ) .",
    "this can give a _ general intuition for multiple bubble collisions _",
    "( figures  [ fig : spherical1 ] and [ fig : spherical2 ] ) . *",
    "we observed more general initial conditions than coleman - deluccia type bubbles .",
    "this was easily done , because we used the double - null formalism .",
    "one interesting observation is that as tension increases _ walls slowly moves _ and they may not be collided ( lower right in figure  [ fig : per_plan ] and lower left and right in figure  [ fig : per_hype_massless ] ) . * the smooth transitions of metric functions ( especially @xmath65 )",
    "are realized .",
    "this can not be done by the thin - wall approximation .",
    "we obtained future boundary formation from smooth initial data without assuming thin - wall and classified various causal structures .",
    "moreover , figure  [ fig : asy ] shows more complicated behavior of horizons of @xmath65 during bubble collisions .",
    "there can be further applications and there will be many other models and issues for bubble collisions .",
    "also , there can be many problems that can be solved by double - null formalism with hyperbolic or planar symmetry .",
    "we leave these for future work .",
