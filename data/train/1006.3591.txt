    "electron correlations play an important role for understanding the electronic structure , magnetism , metal - insulator transition , and the high - temperature superconductivity in the solid - state physics , and thus a large number of theories have been proposed to describe correlated electron systems  @xcite . especially , in the case of magnetism , theories of electron correlations have been developed over fifty years to explain the ferromagnetism of transition metals , since the hartree - fock approximation was recognized to overestimate their magnetic ordering energy .",
    "gutzwiller  @xcite proposed a variational theory which takes into account on - site correlations by controlling the probability amplitudes of doubly occupied states , and showed that electron correlations much instabilize the ferromagnetism .",
    "hubbard  @xcite developed a green function method making use of the equation of motion method and a decoupling approximation that leads to an alloy - analogy picture .",
    "he succeeded in describing the metal - insulator transition as well as the instability of ferromagnetism due to electron correlations .",
    "kanamori  @xcite took into account the multiple scattering of electrons in the low density limit , and showed that the effective coulomb interaction for the ferromagnetic instability is extremely renormalized by electron - electron interactions .",
    "above mentioned theories are limited to the ground state .",
    "cyrot  @xcite extended to finite temperatures an idea of alloy - analogy approximation for electron correlations proposed by hubbard , on the basis of the functional integral method  @xcite .",
    "he explained the t - p phase diagram for metal - insulator transitions qualitatively .",
    "hubbard  @xcite and hasegawa  @xcite independently developed the single - site spin fluctuation theory using the coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite .",
    "they showed that thermal spin fluctuations much reduce the curie temperatures obtained by the stoner theory for band calculations based on the local density approximation ( lda ) to the density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "the single - site spin fluctuation theory reduces to the hartree - fock one at zero temperature because it is based on a high - temperature approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ , the static approximation to the functional integral method . therefore the theory does not take into account the ground - state electron correlations as found by gutzwiller , hubbard , and kanamori .",
    "kakehashi and fulde  @xcite proposed a variational theory which adiabatically takes into account such correlations at finite temperatures , and found further reduction of curie temperature . finally , kakehashi  @xcite proposed the dynamical cpa which completely takes into account the dynamical charge and spin fluctuations within the single - site approximation , and clarified the dynamical effects on the momentum distribution , magnetic moment as well as excitation spectra using the monte - carlo technique . in the next paper  @xcite",
    "which we refer to i in the following , we developed an analytic method to the dynamical cpa , using the harmonic approximation .",
    "in the recent paper  @xcite which we refer to ii , we proposed the first - principles dynamical cpa which combines the dynamical cpa with the tight - binding linear - muffintin - orbital ( tb - lmto )  @xcite base lda+u hamiltonian  @xcite . within the 2nd - order dynamical corrections to the static approximation",
    ", we have shown that the dynamical cpa can describe the finite temperature properties of excitations and magnetism in fe and ni quantitatively or semiquantitatively .    in this paper , we develop further the first - principles dynamical cpa by taking into account higher - order dynamical corrections within an asymptotic approximation , and investigate a systematic change of excitation spectra in 3@xmath1 transition metals from sc to cu .",
    "we will clarify the dynamical effects on the excitation spectra in 3@xmath1 series at finite temperatures , and will explain systematic change of x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) data  @xcite as well as the bremsstrahlung isochromat ( bis ) data  @xcite .",
    "similar calculations have recently been performed at the ground state by belashchenko _ et .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the self - consistent local gw approximation .",
    "their results of the first - principles calculations , however , do not well describe the main peak positions in the xps and the bis data , and seem to require further development of the theory .    as we have proven in the separate papers  @xcite ,",
    "the dynamical cpa is equivalent to the many - body cpa  @xcite developed in the disordered system , the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) in the metal - insulator transition in infinite dimensions  @xcite , and the projection operator method cpa ( pm - cpa )  @xcite for excitation problems .",
    "the dynamical cpa was originally developed to describe the finite - temperature magnetism in metallic systems starting from the static approximation exact in the high - temperature limit .",
    "the theory can treat the transverse spin fluctuations for arbitrary @xmath1 electron number at finite temperatures , though it is not easy in the traditional quantum monte - carlo approach ( qmc )  @xcite .",
    "moreover the theory allows us to calculate excitation spectra up to the temperatures much lower than those calculated by the qmc because the dynamical cpa is an analytic theory which does not rely on the statistical techniques .    in the following section , we outline the first - principles dynamical cpa presented in our paper ii . after having established the basic formulation ,",
    "it is desired how to calculate higher - order terms of individual harmonics in the dynamical part . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the higher - order terms using asymptotic approximation , and obtain the expressions for dynamical corrections . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the results of numerical calculations for the densities of states ( dos ) as the single - particle excitations in 3@xmath1 transition metals .",
    "calculations have been performed at high temperatures , where the present approach works best .",
    "we will demonstrate that the dynamical cpa can explain a systematic change of the dos in 3@xmath1 series from sc to cu .",
    "we also show that the screening effects on the exchange energy parameter are significant for the description of the excitation spectra in mn , fe , and co. in the last section , we summarize the present work and discuss future problems to be solved .",

    "<S> it is shown that the dynamical effects damp main peaks in the densities of states ( dos ) obtained by the local density approximation to the density functional theory , reduce the band broadening due to thermal spin fluctuations , create the mott - hubbard type bands in the case of fcc mn and fcc fe , and create a small hump corresponding to the ` 6 ev ' satellite in the case of co , ni , and cu . calculated </S>",
