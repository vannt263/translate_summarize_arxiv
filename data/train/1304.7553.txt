    "the study of two - component fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect has revealed a tremendous amount of new physics .",
    "the earlier studies were performed on gaas systems  @xcite , where the land g - factor is small and therefore both components of spin can be active at relatively small magnetic fields .",
    "more recently , two - component fqh effect has been studied in systems where valleys play the role of spin , as in alas quantum wells  @xcite and h - terminated si(111 ) surface  @xcite ; here the zeeman energy is large enough to freeze the spin degree of freedom for typical experimental parameters . in graphene",
    ", the two components could be either spins or valleys , depending on parameters  @xcite .",
    "experiments have shown that in general , fqh states with several spin / valley polarization can occur at a given filling factor , and transitions between them can be caused by tuning the zeeman / valley splitting .",
    "these level crossing transitions are understood in terms a competition between the composite fermion ( cf ) cyclotron energy and the zeeman / valley splitting .",
    "a quantitative understanding of this physics has been achieved through halperin s multi - component wave functions  @xcite , and more generally through the theory of spinful composite fermions  @xcite .    given a rich diversity of strongly correlated states of fermions involving the spin physics ,",
    "it is natural to ask what new physics can be learned from the study of two - component bose gases , such as those made up of two hyperfine spin states of the same atoms , in the fqh regime .",
    "neutral bosons can in principle be driven into the fqh regime by rapid rotation  @xcite .",
    "strongly correlation among particles is achieved as the number of vortices @xmath13 in a rotating bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) becomes comparable with the number of atoms @xmath14 as quantified by the filling factor @xmath15 . for simplicity , we will refer to the two components as spins , but the results apply to any two - component bosons for which the interaction is ( approximately ) independent of the component index .",
    "there has been much recent study of bosonic quantum hall states  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the vortex lattice that forms at large @xmath16 melts and that a series of fqh states appear at various filling factors , which include , for appropriately chosen interactions , laughlin  @xcite , jain  @xcite , moore - read  @xcite and read - rezayi  @xcite states .",
    "while fqh effect in cold atom systems has not yet been observed in a convincing manner , substantial progress in that direction has been reported  @xcite .",
    "other ingenious methods to simulate the effect of magnetic field have also been explored  @xcite .",
    "we consider below two - component bosons in the fqh regime . aside from the experimental interest , a motivation for studying this problem is the possibility of realization of new structures that are not available in electronic fqh effect .",
    "in particular , we will see that some fqh states require a tuning of the interaction , which is more easily accomplished in ultracold atomic systems .",
    "the theoretical study of fqh effect has relied on the notion of formation of emergent quasiparticles , description in terms of which provides a tangible way to understand the physical properties of an inherently hard quantum @xmath14-body problem .",
    "the physics of emergent quasiparticles is captured by appropriate wave functions , which , in turn , represent topological phases . to fully classify all topological phases",
    "is a formidable task , but progress has been made in the context of topological insulators and superconductors  @xcite .",
    "however , one can take specific examples and ask if they occur for models with realistic interactions .",
    "we consider in this article several bosonic spin - singlet and spin - partially - polarized states , and ask for what kinds of interaction they would be realized .",
    "some of these support excitations with abelian braid statistics , whereas some with non - abelian braid statistics .",

    "the ubiqutous exponential factor will be omitted in the rest of this paper .",
    "a bosonic fock state is represented using symmetric monomials and a many - body state is the superposition of all monomials with appropriate quantum numbers .",
    "we use the convention that the coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote , respectively , spin - up and spin - down particles , whereas @xmath21 denote _ all _ particles .    the general wave function of two - component bosons ( with @xmath22 spin - up and @xmath23 spin - down bosons ) at filling factor @xmath16 has the form @xmath24\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the spatial part , @xmath26 and @xmath27 refer to the two components , and @xmath28 denotes symmerization .",
    "it is sufficient to consider @xmath29 provided it satisfies appropriate symmetries . an acceptable wave function with spin @xmath30 must satisfy fock s cyclic condition , which means that the state @xmath31 is annihilated by an attempt to antisymmetrize a spin - down particle with respect to the spin - up particles .",

    "an intuitive reason for why bosons convert into composite fermions is because this builds good correlations that keep the particles away from one another and thus reduce the interaction energy . for @xmath55",
