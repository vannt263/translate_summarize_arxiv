    "many interesting nonlinear models in physical sciences and engineering are given by systems of odes .",
    "when studying these systems it is desirable to have a global understanding of the bifurcation and chaos `` spectrum '' : the systematics of periodic orbits , stable as well as unstable ones at fixed and varying parameters , the type of chaotic attractors which usually occur as limits of sequences of periodic regimes , etc .",
    "however , this is by far not a simple job to accomplish neither by purely analytical means nor by numerical work alone . in analytical aspect , just recollect the long - standing problem of the number of limit cycles in _ planar _ systems of odes . as chaotic behavior",
    "may appear only in systems of more than three autonomous odes , it naturally leads to problems much more formidable than counting the number of limit cycles in planar systems . as numerical study",
    "is concerned , one can never be confident that all stable periodic orbits up to a certain length have been found in a given parameter range or no short unstable orbits in a chaotic attractor have been missed at a fixed parameter set , not to mention that it is extremely difficult to draw global conclusions from numerical data alone .    on the other hand , a properly constructed symbolic dynamics , being a coarse - grained description ,",
    "provides a powerful tool to capture global , topological aspects of the dynamics .",
    "this has been convincingly shown in the development of symbolic dynamics of one - dimensional ( 1d ) maps , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "since it is well known from numerical observations that chaotic attractors of many higher - dimensional dissipative systems with one positive lyapunov exponent reveal 1d - like structure in some poincar sections , it has been suggested to associate the systematics of numerically found periodic orbits in odes with symbolic dynamics of 1d maps @xcite . while this approach has had some success ( see , e.g. , chapter  5 of @xcite )",
    ", many new questions arose from the case studies .",
    "for example , + 1 .",
    "the number of short stable periodic orbits found in odes is usually less than that allowed by the admissibility conditions of the corresponding 1d symbolic dynamics . within the 1d framework it is hard to tell whether a missing period was caused by insufficient numerical search or",
    "was forbidden by the dynamics .",
    "\\2 . in the poincar sections of odes , at a closer examination , the attractors often reveal two - dimensional features such as layers and folds .",
    "one has to explain the success of 1d description which sometimes even turns out much better than expected . at the same time",
    ", the limitation of 1d approach has to be analyzed as the poincar maps are actually two - dimensional .",
    "early efforts were more or less concentrated on stable orbits , while unstable periods play a fundamental role in organizing chaotic motion .",
    "one has to develop symbolic dynamics for odes which would be capable to treat stable and unstable periodic orbits alike , to indicate the structure of some , though not all , chaotic orbits at a given parameter set .",
    "the elucidation of these problems has to await a significant progress of symbolic dynamics of 2d maps .",
    "now the time is ripe for an in depth symbolic dynamics analysis of a few typical odes .",
    "this kind of analysis has been carried out on several non - autonomous systems @xcite , where the stroboscopic sampling method @xcite greatly simplifies the calculation of poincar maps . in this paper",
    "we consider an autonomous system , namely , the lorenz model , in which one of the first chaotic attractor was discovered @xcite .",
    "the lorenz model consists of three equations @xmath0 it is known that several models of hydrodynamical , mechanical , dynamo and laser problems may be reduced to this set of odes .",
    "the system ( [ lorenz ] ) contains three parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , representing respectively the rayleigh number , the prandtl number and a geometric ratio .",
    "we will study the system in a wide @xmath1-range at fixed @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we put together a few known facts on eq .",
    "[ lorenz ] to fix the notations . for detailed derivations one may refer to the book @xcite by c. sparrow .",
    "for @xmath6 the origin @xmath7 is a globally stable fixed point .",
    "it loses stability at @xmath8 . a 1d unstable manifold and a 2d stable manifold @xmath9 come out from the unstable origin .",
    "the intersection of the 2d @xmath9 with the poincar section will determine a demarcation line in the partition of the 2d phase plane of the poincar map .",
    "for @xmath10 there appears a pair of fixed points @xmath11 these two fixed points remain stable until @xmath1 reaches 24.74 .",
    "although their eigenvalues undergo some qualitative changes at @xmath12 and a strange invariant set ( not an attractor yet ) comes into life at @xmath13 , here we are not interested in all this .",
    "it is at @xmath14 a sub - critical hopf bifurcation takes place and chaotic regimes commence .",
    "our @xmath1-range extends from 28 to very big values , e.g. , 10000 , as nothing qualitatively new appears at , say , @xmath15 .    before undertaking the symbolic dynamics analysis",
    "we summarize briefly what has been done on the lorenz system from the viewpoint of symbolic dynamics .",
    "guckenheimer and williams introduced the geometric lorenz model @xcite for the vicinity of @xmath16 which leads to symbolic dynamics on two letters , proving the existence of chaos in the geometric model .",
    "however , as smale @xcite pointed out it remains an unsolved problem as whether the geometric lorenz model means to the real lorenz system .",
    "though not using symbolic dynamics at all , the paper by tomita and tsuda @xcite studying the lorenz equations at a different set of parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 is worth mentioning .",
    "they noticed that the quasi-1d chaotic attractor in the @xmath19 poincar section outlined by the upward intersections of the trajectories may be directly parameterized by the @xmath20 coordinates .",
    "a 1d map was devised in @xcite to numerically mimic the global bifurcation structure of the lorenz model . c. sparrow @xcite used two symbols @xmath20 and @xmath21 to encode orbits without explicitly constructing symbolic dynamics . in appendix",
    "j of @xcite sparrow described a family of 1d maps as `` an obvious choice if we wish to try and model the behavior of the lorenz equations in the parameter range @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath22 '' . in what follows",
    "we will call this family the _ lorenz - sparrow map_. refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite have been instrumental for the present study . in fact , the 1d maps to be obtained from the 2d upward poincar maps of the lorenz equations after some manipulations belong precisely to the family suggested by sparrow . in @xcite",
    "the systematics of stable periodic orbits in the lorenz equations was compared with that of a 1d anti - symmetric cubic map .",
    "the choice of an anti - symmetric map was dictated by the invariance of the lorenz equations under the discrete transformation @xmath23 indeed , most of the periods known to @xcite are ordered in a `` cubic '' way .",
    "however , many short periods present in the 1d map have not been found in the lorenz equations .",
    "it was realized in @xcite that a cubic map with a discontinuity in the center may better reflect the odes and many of the missing periods are excluded by the 2d nature of the poincar map . instead of devising model maps for comparison one should generate all related 1d or 2d maps directly from the lorenz equations and construct the corresponding symbolic dynamics .",
    "this makes the main body of the present paper .    for physicists",
    "symbolic dynamics is nothing but a coarse - grained description of the dynamics .",
    "the success of symbolic dynamics depends on how the coarse - graining is performed , i.e. , on the partition of the phase space . from a practical point of view",
    "we can put forward the following requirements for a good partition .",
    "1 . it should assign a _",
    "unique _ name to each unstable periodic orbit in the system ; 2 .",
    "an ordering rule of all symbolic sequences should be defined ; 3 .",
    "admissibility conditions as whether a given symbolic sequence is allowed by the dynamics should be formulated ; 4 .",
    "based on the admissibility conditions and ordering rule one should be able to generate and locate all periodic orbits , stable and unstable , up to a given length .",
    "symbolic dynamics of 1d maps has been well understood @xcite .",
    "symbolic dynamics of 2d maps has been studies in @xcite .",
    "we will explain the main idea and technique in the context of the lorenz equations .",
    "a few words on the research strategy may be in order .",
    "we will first calculate the poincar maps in suitably chosen sections . if necessary some forward contracting foliations ( fcfs , to be explained later ) are superimposed on the poincar map , the attractor being part of the backward contracting foliations ( bcfs ) .",
    "then a one - parameter parameterization is introduced for the quasi-1d attractor . for our choice of the poincar sections the parameterization",
    "is simply realized by the @xmath20 coordinates of the points . in terms of these @xmath24 a first return map @xmath25",
    "is constructed . using the specific property of first return maps that the set @xmath26 remains the same before and after the mapping",
    ", some parts of @xmath26 may be safely shifted and swapped to yield a new map @xmath27 , which precisely belongs to the family of lorenz - sparrow map . in so doing , all 2d features ( layers , folds , etc . )",
    "however , one can always start from the symbolic dynamics of the 1d lorenz - sparrow map to generate a list of allowed periods and then check them against the admissibility conditions of the 2d symbolic dynamics . using the ordering of symbolic sequences all allowed periods may be located easily .",
    "what said applies to unstable periodic orbits at fixed parameter set .",
    "the same method can be adapted to treat stable periods either by superimposing the orbital points on a near - by chaotic attractor or by keeping a sufficient number of transient points .",
    "the poincar map in the @xmath19 plane captures most of the interesting dynamics as it contains both fixed points @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath29-axis is contained in the stable manifold @xmath9 of the origin @xmath7 .",
    "all orbits reaching the @xmath29-axis will be attracted to the origin , thus most of the homoclinic behavior may be tracked in this plane . in principle , either downward or upward intersections of trajectories with the @xmath19 plane may be used to generate the poincar map . however ,",
    "upward intersections with @xmath30 have the practical merit to yield 1d - like objects which may be parameterized by simply using the @xmath20 coordinates .",
    "[ hlzfig1 ] shows a poincar section at @xmath31 .",
    "the dashed curves and diamonds represent one of the fcfs and its tangent points with the bcf .",
    "these will be used later in sec .",
    "v. the 1d - like structure of the attractor is apparent . only the thickening in some part of the attractor hints on 2d structures . ignoring the thickening for the time being",
    ", the 1d attractor may be parameterized by the @xmath20 coordinates only .",
    "collecting successive @xmath32 , we construct a first return map @xmath25 as shown in fig .",
    "[ hlzfig2 ] .",
    "it consists of four symmetrically located pieces with gaps on the mapping interval . for a first return map a gap belonging to both @xmath33 and @xmath34 plays no role in the dynamics . if necessary",
    ", we can use this specificity of return maps to squeeze some gaps in @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , we can interchange the left subinterval with the right one by defining , e.g. , @xmath35 the precise value of the numerical constant is not essential ; it may be estimated from the upper bound of @xmath36 and is so chosen as to make the final figure look nicer . the swapped first return map , as we call it , is shown in fig .  [ hlzfig3 ] .",
    "the corresponding tangent points between fcf and bcf ( the diamonds ) are also drawn on these return maps for later use .",
    "it is crucial that the parameterization and swapping do keep the 2d features present in the poincar map .",
    "this is important when it comes to take into account the 2d nature of the poincar maps .    in fig .",
    "[ hlzfig4 ] poincar maps at 9 different values from @xmath16 to 203 are shown .",
    "the corresponding swapped return maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ hlzfig5 ] . generally speaking , as  @xmath1 varies from small to greater values , these maps undergo transitions from 1d - like to 2d - like , and then to 1d - like again . even in the 2d - like range",
    "the 1d backbones still dominate .",
    "this partly explains our early success @xcite in applying purely 1d symbolic dynamics to the lorenz model .",
    "we will learn how to judge this success later on .",
    "some qualitative changes at varying  @xmath1 will be discussed in sec .",
    "we note also that the return map at @xmath16 complies with what follows from the geometric lorenz model .",
    "the symbolic dynamics of this lorenz - like map has been completely constructed @xcite .",
    "all the return maps shown in fig .  [ hlzfig5 ]",
    "fit into the family of lorenz - sparrow map .",
    "therefore , we take a general map from the family and construct the symbolic dynamics . there is no need to have analytical expression for the map .",
    "suffice it to define a map by the shape shown in fig .",
    "[ hlzfig6 ] .",
    "this map has four monotone branches , defined on four subintervals labeled by the letters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "we will also use these same letters to denote the monotone branches themselves , although we do not have an expression for the mapping function @xmath41 . among these branches @xmath40 and @xmath38",
    "are increasing ; we say @xmath40 and @xmath38 have an even or @xmath42 _ parity_. the decreasing branches @xmath37 and @xmath39 have odd or @xmath43 parity . between the monotone branches",
    "there are `` turning points '' ( `` critical points '' ) @xmath44 and @xmath45 as well as `` breaking point '' @xmath46 , where a discontinuity is present . any numerical trajectory @xmath47 in this map corresponds to a symbolic sequence @xmath48 where @xmath49 , depending on where the point @xmath32 falls in .",
    "all symbolic sequences made of these letters may be ordered in the following way .",
    "first , there is a natural order @xmath50 next , if two symbolic sequences @xmath51 and @xmath52 have a common leading string @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath56 are different , they must have ordered according to ( [ order1 ] ) .",
    "the _ ordering rule _ is : if @xmath57 is even , i.e. , it contains an even number of @xmath39 and @xmath37 , the order of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is given by that of @xmath2 and @xmath56 ; if @xmath53 is odd , the order is the opposite to that of @xmath2 and @xmath56 .",
    "the ordering rule may be put in the following form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) represents a finite string of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 containing an _ even _",
    "( _ odd _ ) number of letters @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "we call @xmath59 and @xmath60 even and odd string , respectively .    in order to incorporate the discrete symmetry ,",
    "we define a transformation @xmath61 of symbols : @xmath62 keeping @xmath46 unchanged .",
    "sometimes we distinguish the left and right limit of @xmath46 , then we add @xmath63 .",
    "we often denote @xmath64 by @xmath65 and say @xmath57 and @xmath65 are mirror images to each other .",
    "symbolic sequences that start from the next iterate of the turning or breaking points play a key role in symbolic dynamics .",
    "they are called _ kneading sequences _ @xcite . naming a symbolic sequence by the initial number which corresponds to its first symbol , we have two kneading sequences from the turning points : @xmath66 being mirror images to each other , we take @xmath67 as the independent one .    for first return maps the rightmost point in @xmath26",
    "equals the highest point after the mapping .",
    "therefore , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , see fig .",
    "[ hlzfig6 ] .",
    "we take @xmath70 as another kneading sequence .",
    "note that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are not necessarily the left and right limit of the breaking point ; a finite gap may exist in between .",
    "this is associated with the flexibility of choosing the shift constant , e.g. , the number 36 in ( [ swap ] ) .",
    "since a kneading sequence starts from the first iterate of a turning or breaking point , we have @xmath73    a 1d map with multiple critical points is best parameterized by its kneading sequences .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the lorenz - sparrow map is entirely determined by a _ kneading pair _ @xmath74 .",
    "given a kneading pair @xmath74 , not all symbolic sequences are allowed in the dynamics . in order to formulate the admissibility conditions we need a new notion .",
    "take a symbolic sequence @xmath57 and inspect its symbols one by one .",
    "whenever a letter @xmath37 is encountered , we collect the subsequent sequence that follows this @xmath37 .",
    "the set of all such sequences is denoted by @xmath75 and is called a @xmath37-shift set of @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    the _ admissibility conditions _ , based on the ordering rule ( [ forder1 ] ) , follow from ( [ knead ] ) : @xmath79 here in the two middle relations we have canceled the leading @xmath40 or @xmath38 .",
    "the twofold meaning of the admissibility conditions should be emphasized . on one hand , for a given kneading pair these conditions select those symbolic sequences which may occur in the dynamics . on the other hand , a kneading pair @xmath74 , being symbolic sequences themselves , must also satisfy conditions ( [ admis ] ) with @xmath57 replaced by @xmath67 and @xmath70 .",
    "such @xmath74 is called a _",
    "compatible _ kneading pair .",
    "the first meaning concerns admissible sequences in the phase space at a fixed parameter set while the second deals with compatible kneading pairs in the parameter space . in accordance with these two aspects",
    "there are two pieces of work to be done .",
    "first , generate all compatible kneading pairs up to a given length .",
    "this is treated in appendix  a. second , generate all admissible symbolic sequences up to a certain length for a given kneading pair @xmath74 .",
    "the procedure is described in appendix  b.      it is convenient to introduce a metric representation of symbolic sequences by associating a real number @xmath80 to each sequence @xmath57 .",
    "to do so let us look at the piecewise linear map shown in fig .",
    "[ hlzfig7 ] .",
    "it is an analog of the surjective tent map in the sense that all symbolic sequences made of the four letters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath40 , and @xmath39 are allowed .",
    "it is obvious that the maximal sequence is @xmath81 while the minimal one being @xmath82 . for this map one may further write @xmath83    to introduce the metric representation we first use @xmath84 to mark the even parity of @xmath38 and @xmath40 , and @xmath85 to mark the odd parity of @xmath37 and @xmath39 . next , the number @xmath86 is defined for a sequence @xmath87 as @xmath88 where @xmath89 or , @xmath90 it is easy to check that @xmath91 the following relations hold for any symbolic sequence @xmath57 : @xmath92 one may also formulate the admissibility conditions in terms of the metric representations .",
    "the family of the lorenz - sparrow map includes some limiting cases .",
    "+ . the @xmath39 branch may disappear , and the minimal point of the @xmath40 branch moves to the left end of the interval .",
    "this may be described as @xmath93 it defines the only kneading sequence @xmath67 from the next iterate of @xmath45 .",
    "the minimum at @xmath45 may rise above the horizontal axis , as it is evident in fig .",
    "[ hlzfig5 ] at @xmath94 .",
    "the second iterate of either the left or right subinterval then retains in the same subinterval .",
    "consequently , the two kneading sequences are no longer independent and they are bound by the relation @xmath95    both one - parameter limits appear in the lorenz equations as we shall see in the next section .",
    "now we are well prepared to carry out a 1d symbolic dynamics analysis of the lorenz equations using the swapped return maps shown in fig .",
    "[ hlzfig5 ] .",
    "we take @xmath31 as an working example .",
    "the rightmost point in @xmath26 and the minimum at @xmath45 determine the two kneading sequences : @xmath96 indeed , they satisfy ( [ admis ] ) and form a compatible kneading pair . using the propositions formulated in appendix  b , all admissible periodic sequences up to period",
    "6 are generated .",
    "they are @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 . here",
    "the letter @xmath45 is used to denote both @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , there are altogether 17 unstable periodic orbits with period equal or less than  6 . relying on the ordering of symbolic sequences and using a bisection method ,",
    "these unstable periodic orbits may be quickly located in the phase plane .",
    "it should be emphasized that we are dealing with unstable periodic orbits at a fixed parameter set .",
    "there is no such thing as superstable periodic sequence or periodic window which would appear when one considers kneading sequences with varying parameters .",
    "consequently , the existence of @xmath107 and @xmath108 does not necessarily imply the existence of @xmath97 .",
    "similar analysis may be carried out for other @xmath1 . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we collect some kneading sequences at different @xmath1-values .",
    "their corresponding metric representations are also included .",
    "we first note that they do satisfy the admissibility conditions ( [ admis ] ) , i.e. , @xmath67 and @xmath70 at each  @xmath1 make a compatible kneading pair . an instructive way of presenting the data consists in drawing the plane of metric representation for both @xmath109 and @xmath110 , see fig .",
    "[ hlzfig8 ] .",
    "the compatibility conditions require , in particular , @xmath111 , therefore only the upper left triangular region is accessible ."
