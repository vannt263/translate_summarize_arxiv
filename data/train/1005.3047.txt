    "in a detailed study of gould s belt @xcite , the brightest stars in the cluster ( hd37016 , hd37017 and hd37040 ) had their spectral types determined ( b2.5v , b1.5v , b2.5iv , respectively ) and photometric distances estimated ( all at @xmath17 pc ) .",

    "colour - magnitude diagrams of open clusters usually present well - defined stellar sequences such as the main sequence , turn - off and giant branch that provide essential information on the physical properties of these objects .",
    "however , the characterization of open clusters is often hindered by strong reddening and field - star contamination , specially for the objects projected against the galactic centre or sparsely populated .",
    "the identification of the cluster stars as opposed to the field - star contamination is very important in the study of these objects .",
    "assessing membership using proper motion data is only available for a small subset of the known open clusters , particularly the closest ones .",
    "an alternative method for disentangling cluster and field - stars consists of using photometric data by means of statistical comparison of star samples taken from the cluster region and from an offset - field .",
    "our decontamination procedure is one of these methods and was based on the work of @xcite .",
    "a field - star decontamination procedure was carried out by firstly selecting an appropriate comparison field presenting stellar density and reddening similar to the cluster . while circular annular fields circumscribed to the cluster area are appropriated for clusters in dense regions and homogeneous backgrounds , they fail on regions affected by differential reddening or rapidly changing backgrounds .",
    "therefore , an adjacent field with similar reddening was selected for ngc1981 considering the nebulosity contamination from ngc1977 in the southern region of the cluster . regarding the cluster area ,",
    "the data included stars within the inner 16 arcmin of the determined centre .",
    "this central region corresponds to the cluster visual radius , chosen to encompass the brightest b type stars in the field .",
    "we built 3d colour - magnitude diagrams for both cluster and field - stars with @xmath32 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 as axes .",
    "these colours provide better discrimination among the clusters sequences on the cmd @xcite .",
    "the diagrams were divided into small cells of average sizes @xmath70mag , @xmath71mag and @xmath72 mag , corresponding roughly to ten times the average uncertainties in the colours .",
    "these cells are small enough to detect local variations of field - star contamination on the various sequences in the cmd , but large enough to accommodate a significant number of stars .",
    "the grids in fig .",
    "[ f : dcmd ] illustrate these cell sizes .    initial cluster membership was assigned to cluster stars within each cell based on their overdensity with relation to the field - stars , according to the relation .",
    "null probability was assigned whenever an excess of field - stars over cluster stars occurred in a given cell .",
    "a subset of the original cluster sample was created by removing from each cell on the cluster cmd , the expected number of field - stars as measured in the control field cmd based on their distance to the calculated centre of the cluster .",
    "particularly , each cell on the cluster cmd had the stars most distant from the cluster centre removed and cells without cluster overdensity had all stars inside their limits removed .    in order to account for the initial choice of parameters , we applied the described method for different grid specifications by changing the position and size of the cells in each of the cmd axes .",
    "cell positions were changed by shifting the entire grid one third of the cell size in each direction .",
    "cell sizes were increased and decreased by one third of the average sizes in each of the cmd axes . considering all possible configurations ,",
    "729 different grid sets were used to derive final membership probabilities by taking the average , median and mode of the membership obtained in each configuration for each star .",
    "an exclusion index was also created by noting how many times each star was removed from the sample , and then normalizing by the number of grid configurations .",
    "possible effects of the offset - field selection were investigated by applying the method to 3 additional comparison fields 1@xmath29 distant from the cluster in different directions northward of the cluster .",
    "the average , median and mode of the membership of each star , obtained from the multiple grid configurations , were compared once different offset - fields were employed in the decontamination method .",
    "the offset - field selection implied mean deviations of 7 per cent on the average membership , 8 per cent on the median membership and 12 per cent on the mode membership .",
    "these values were adopted as the general uncertainty of these statistical indicators .",
    "final membership probabilities were thus assigned to each star by taking the average of the membership from each grid configuration .",
    "the decontaminated sample was obtained by removing stars based on another two complementary criteria .",
    "first , stars with average membership value lower than 7 per cent or median membership value lower than 8 per cent were removed .",
    "second , stars with exclusion index larger than 50 per cent were removed .",
    "the first criterion ensures the removal of stars that could present null membership , based on the uncertainties of each statistical indicator .",
    "the second criterion is based on the exclusion index and decontaminate the cluster sequences by removing the expected field population .",
    "the exclusion index threshold ( 50 per cent ) was set to provide the removal of approximately the same number of stars removed by the first criterion .",
    "the adopted criteria complement each other well , acting on different parts of the cmd and presenting very little overlapping of the removed stars .",
    "the first criterion removes stars with low membership probability , acting mainly on regions where the cluster and field population are entangled , presenting roughly the same density on the cmd . for ngc1981",
    "it represents the lower and mid - main sequence / pre - main sequence . for the second criterion ,",
    "it is worth recalling that stars where removed from each cluster cmd cell according to the counts from the offset - field cmd and on the distance from the cluster centre .",
    "therefore the second criterion clean the cluster sequences from the stars in the outer regions of the cluster and effectively removes from the cmd the stars were field population is dominant .",
    "it decontaminates the region of the pre - main sequence stars , mainly for the fainter regions ( @xmath73 ) .",

    "probe the field population , the procedure was applied on stars within 32 arcmin from the cluster centre and the resulting decontaminated sample , used in the subsequent analysis , was truncated at the visual radius of the cluster ( 16 arcmin ) .",
    "this truncation was done because the adjacent southern clouds associated to ngc1977 yield a very reddened population which occupy a well defined region in the cmd ( see sect .",
    "the cmd locus of this reddened population does not overimpose that of most cluster stars therefore not interfering with the decontamination procedure",
    ". however , even inside the visual radius , very reddened stars presenting @xmath74 and @xmath75 appear on the southern region of the cluster ( crosses in fig .",
    "[ f : dcmd ] ) .",
    "they were not properly sampled by the field population and therefore could neither be excluded by the procedure nor present reliable membership probabilities .",

    "[ f : dchart ] shows the sky chart of ngc1981 up to 16 arcmin , comparing the member and field population .",
    "structural parameters derived in sect . 4 are also indicated .",
    "the number of stars removed from the contaminated sample do not account for the entire field population because the expected number of field - stars measured on the offset - field is still higher than the number of excluded stars . on average ,",
    "each criterion removed 45 per cent of the field population while presenting a common exclusion rate of 5 per cent and a total decontamination efficiency of 85 per cent .",
    "most of the exclusion takes place in the crowded areas of the cmd as 95 per cent of the stars excluded belong to the lower main - sequence ( @xmath76 ) .    the choice of the offset - field accounts for an average deviation of 5 per cent in the number of stars left in the decontaminated subsamples ( member stars ) .",
    "moreover the fraction of recurring member stars , independent of the offset - field , is greater than 87 per cent .",

    "comparison of the ucac2 proper motion with our membership results was done using the 2mass designation to identify the common stars between the datasets .",

    "although the photometric members present a concentration near @xmath79 , this is also true for the field stars , as can be more easily seen in the probability distribution histograms ( bottom panels ) .",
    "as the statistical distance between the cluster and field proper motion distributions is small , it is difficult to separate the populations .",
    "this effect becomes more accentuated for clusters where there is a large field to cluster member ratio or when the centroids of the proper motion distributions are very close to each other , such as in the case of ngc1981 .",
    "this problem has already been discussed by @xcite and @xcite which proposed to use the spatial distribution of the stars , in addition to their proper motion distribuition , to increase the statistical distance between the populations .",
    "in fact , membership probabilities have been estimated for ngc1981 by @xcite using ucac2 proper motion of 160 stars within 15 arcmin of the cluster centre .",
    "the comparison between these memberships and the photometric memberships derived in this work shows a very poor correlation , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : corpm ] ( left panel ) .",
    "although the small statistical distance between the populations may account for the large scattering in the proper motion membership , especially for the low - membership stars , it seems that the derived photometric memberships are , in average , underestimated in relation to the proper motion ones .",
    "this trend is still visible when the low - membership stars are removed from both the photometric and proper motion sample , although the correspondence between the samples improves as most of the remaining stars present membership differences smaller than 20 per cent ( right panel ) .",

    "although the literature reddening value provided a good isochrone fitting on the infrared data , the reddening value obtained from the @xmath84 cmd suggests that the extinction in the optical bands is larger by a factor of 2 .",
