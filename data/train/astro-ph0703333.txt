    "one of the most persistent problems in solar physics has been the unambiguous identification of the mechanisms that heat the sun s corona and accelerate the solar wind .",
    "many processes have been proposed for converting some fraction of the mechanical energy in subphotospheric convective motions to heat , but it has proved very difficult to make distinguishing comparisons between the predictions of these competing ideas and specific observations .",
    "we are entering an era , though , where both the models and the measurements are improving to the point of soon being able to eliminate many of the candidate theories .",
    "for example , it seems increasingly clear that closed loops in the low corona are heated by small - scale , intermittent magnetic reconnection that is driven by the continual stressing of their magnetic footpoints ( see recent reviews by longcope 2004 ; gudiksen 2005 ; aschwanden 2006 ; klimchuk 2006 ) .    in this paper",
    "we model the coronal heating along open field lines that reach into interplanetary space .",
    "we construct a self - consistent model of the photosphere , chromosphere , corona , and solar wind that is driven mainly by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence and is free of arbitrary `` heating functions '' that have been used in the past .",
    "this work continues earlier studies ( cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 ; cranmer 2005a ) which used prescribed empirical descriptions of the density and flow velocity along an open flux tube in order to compute the rates of turbulent heating and acceleration . the main goal of this paper is to provide a possible explanation for the origin and properties of fast and slow solar wind streams .",
    "another goal , though , is to illustrate how the particular description of mhd turbulence can be applied to more advanced modeling efforts  specifically those that attempt to reproduce the full three - dimensional and time - dependent nature of the corona and heliosphere ( e.g. , riley et al .   2001 ;",
    "roussev et al .   2003 ; tth et al .",
    "2005 ; usmanov & goldstein 2006 ) .",
    "coronal heating and solar wind acceleration have been known to be closely linked since the initial contributions of parker ( 1958 ) .",
    "however , nearly all subsequent theoretical attempts to model both processes together have made limiting assumptions about either the heating ( i.e. , ad  hoc energy input rates ) or the acceleration ( i.e. , a prescribed mass flux ) .",
    "it has been realized over the past few decades that it is key to resolve the full chromosphere - corona transition region in order to produce a model with an internally consistent radial dependence of pressure , density , and flow speed ( see hammer 1982 ; hansteen & leer 1995 ; hansteen et al .",
    "1997 ; lie - svendsen & esser 2005 ) . to our knowledge , the only solar wind models ",
    "other than the ones presented in this paper  that contain _ both _ a first - principles approach to coronal heating and a self - consistent chromosphere , transition region , and mass flux are those of suzuki & inutsuka ( 2005 , 2006 ) . and @xmath0 k ) .",
    "see   2 below for a comparison of the relevant physical assumptions and numerical approaches . ]",
    "the study of mhd turbulence as a potential source of heating for the solar wind goes back to coleman ( 1968 ) and jokipii & davis ( 1969 ) .",
    "hollweg ( 1986 ) extended these ideas down into the corona and laid the foundations for the cascade - driven heating rates used by isenberg ( 1990 ) , li et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , matthaeus et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , dmitruk et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) , and this paper .",
    "these ideas are highly complementary to theoretical models of wave dissipation via ion cyclotron resonance ( e.g. , hollweg & isenberg 2002 ; cranmer 2000 , 2001 , 2002 ) that have been invoked to explain the observed preferential heating of heavy ions in the extended corona ( kohl et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 2006 ) . in the cascade paradigm",
    ", the energy in large - scale alfvnic fluctuations must eventually be dissipated in small - scale ( short wavelength or high frequency ) collisionless kinetic modes .",
    "the results from this paper can thus be used as initial conditions for detailed models of the anisotropic turbulent cascade and minor ion heating .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present an overview of the general principles involved in our modeling effort ( i.e. , why certain physical processes are included or excluded ) .   3 gives the conservation equations that are solved and the adopted prescriptions for basic ingredients such as radiative heating / cooling and conduction .",
    "the detailed treatment of waves is described in the following three sections : acoustic waves and shock heating in   4 , alfvn waves and turbulent cascade in   5 , and the ponderomotive wave pressure acceleration due to both types of fluctuations in ",
    "the numerical methods used to solve the equations and the newly developed computer code , called zephyr , are described in   7 .",
    "we then present a comprehensive set of solutions for the solar wind emerging from coronal holes , helmet streamers , and active regions (   8) .",
    "a summary of the major results of this paper , together with a discussion of the implications for understanding the winds of other stars , is given in ",
    "we consider the _ one - dimensional _ variation of plasma parameters along a radially pointed magnetic flux tube rooted in the solar photosphere and open to interplanetary space .",
    "some effects of the multi - dimensional magnetic field in the photosphere and chromosphere are included as explicit superradial expansion of the flux tube ( see also cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 ) , but otherwise we ignore the effects of neighboring closed flux tubes .",
    "we assume that most of the plasma that eventually becomes the time - steady solar wind originates in small ( 100 km sized ) intergranular flux concentrations that are concentrated most densely in the supergranular network .",
    "the models we construct are _ time - independent _ solutions to the hydrodynamic conservation equations .",
    "this may be a restrictive simplification since all observed layers of the solar atmosphere are intrinsically dynamic over a wide range of time scales .",
    "it is evident , for example , that the transition region is `` strongly nonuniform and magnetically structured '' ( marsch et al .   2006 ) to the extent that one - dimensional layered models may miss some important physical effects at those heights .",
    "however , the corona above the transition region seems to exist in its hot ( @xmath1 k ) state all the time .",
    "also , in  situ measurements of the solar wind plasma often can be interpreted clearly as a superposition of a quasi - steady supersonic flow ( which depends mainly on the coronal source region of the streams being measured or on stream - stream interactions ) and a rapidly varying turbulent or wavelike component .",
    "we thus separate these two scales and model the fluctuations using energy conservation equations derived from linear wave theory .",
    "it is especially beneficial to treat waves and turbulent motions statistically  rather than follow the oscillations explicitly in time  when the dynamically important ranges of wavelength and period span many orders of magnitude .",
    "alfvn waves in the solar wind are measured to have periods from seconds to days ( e.g. , goldstein et al .   1995 ; tu & marsch 1995 ) and there is evidence that the waves that dominate the dissipation in the collisionless extended corona have periods even below @xmath2 s ( mckenzie et al .   1995 ; cranmer et al .",
    "if this full range of scales had to be resolved in order to track the motions in a time - dependent numerical model , it would be extremely difficult to simulate the macroscopic plasma properties simultaneously from the photosphere to the heliosphere .",
    "there are , however , some clear disadvantages in modeling fluctuations as statistical `` wave energy fluxes '' rather than as explicit variations .",
    "any nonlinear processes , such as shock steepening , turbulent cascade , mode conversion , or ponderomotive forces , must be inserted beforehand as source or sink terms in the time - steady conservation equations .",
    "time - dependent mhd models have the benefit of producing such effects naturally ( e.g. , ofman & davila 1998 ; ofman 2005 ; bogdan et al .   2002 , 2003 ; suzuki & inutsuka 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "however , by resolving only certain temporal and spatial scales , these models are limited in ways that a statistical treatment is not .",
    "for example , the relative importance of shock dissipation in the time - dependent models of suzuki & inutsuka ( 2005 , 2006 ) may be an artifact of either the inability to resolve small enough scales ( which could drive processes such as perpendicular cascade , landau damping , and collisionless particle energization at shocks ) or the waveguide - like trapping of fluctuations along the model flux tube .",
    "it is important to note , though , that neither extreme  i.e .",
    ", neither coarse time - dependent simulations nor statistical ( and more approximate ) time - independent models  is ideal .",
    "there may be value in seeking some kind of hybrid methodology between these two approaches .    as indicated above",
    ", the only source of heating for the chromosphere and corona that we consider is the dissipation of _ waves and turbulent motions . _ for open flux tubes , a substantial fraction of the energy appears to be deposited at large heights in the wind s acceleration region ",
    "i.e . , at spatial scales much larger than the sizes of low - lying closed loops in the quiet sun and active regions .",
    "this demands the energy be propagated for some distance , presumably by waves or turbulent eddies , before it is dissipated .",
    "however , the general phenomenology of turbulence is probably not limited to the open - field regions .",
    "concepts from turbulence theory have been applied to the full range of time scales for closed - field coronal energy input as well , from the most rapid ( ac ) wavelike oscillations to the slowest ( dc ) quasistatic stresses on magnetic footpoints ( see van ballegooijen 1986 ; hendrix & van hoven 1996 ; milano et al .",
    "1997 ; gmez et al .",
    "2000 ; chae et al .",
    "indeed , some recent simulations of intermittent turbulent heating in closed loops have been interpreted using similar cascade rate expressions as we use in this paper ( rappazzo et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the models presented below include the effects of both alfvn waves and acoustic waves on the mean flow .",
    "we assume implicitly that all waves propagate parallel to the radially oriented flux tube , but this is not an essential feature .",
    "in the magnetically dominated corona ( where @xmath3 ; @xmath4 being the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure ) the modeled alfvn waves can be considered essentially to be the sum of true alfvnic wave power and fast - mode mhd wave power . the acoustic waves can be considered equivalent to slow - mode mhd waves . as a starting point",
    ", we neglect all nonlinear couplings between the alfvn and acoustic wave modes . by ignoring the enhanced reflection and dissipation that may arise because of these couplings ( e.g. , suzuki & inutsuka 2005 , 2006 ) we essentially _ underestimate _ the heat deposited in the extended corona and heliosphere .",
    "the fact that sufficient energy nonetheless exists to heat the corona and accelerate the wind ( mainly from the alfvn waves ) appears to deemphasize the need for such mode couplings .",
    "it should be noted that the attention given to modeling the steepening and shock dissipation of the acoustic waves (   4 ) does not seem to have much of a `` payoff '' in the resulting properties of the corona and solar wind .",
    "the fully ionized outer atmosphere is extremely insensitive to the magnitude ( or sometimes even the presence ) of acoustic wave power that comes up from below the photosphere (   8.2 ) . accordingly",
    ", many prior studies of the coupled chromosphere and corona used a much simpler prescription for maintaining the chromosphere .",
    "we believe it is important , though , to treat both the chromospheric and coronal heating at a comparable level of first - principles modeling .",
    "we also anticipate that the zephyr code developed here will be applied to the simulations of winds of other late - type stars that may have acoustically heated coronae ( e.g. , mullan & cheng 1993 ; schrijver 1995 ) , and thus the acoustic waves should be treated as realistically as possible .",
    "one final limitation of the models presented below is that the energy conservation is treated in a _",
    "one - fluid _ manner .",
    "the protons , electrons , and heavy ions are modeled as having a common flow speed @xmath5 and temperature @xmath6 , with microscopic velocity distributions that are simple isotropic maxwellians .",
    "this is an extreme simplification of reality , since it has been known since the 1960s that the in  situ solar wind exhibits significant departures from a thermalized equilibrium ( see reviews by hundhausen 1972 ; feldman & marsch 1997 ) .",
    "many of these effects persist down into the extended corona as well ( e.g. , kohl et al .   2006 ) .",
    "therefore , theoretical models have long included a range of attempts to deal with these features .",
    "fluid - based models have been extended to solve separate conservation equations for each particle species , and they have been reconstructed in various ways based on different parameterizations for the anisotropic velocity distributions .",
    "several purely kinetic models have also been attempted ( see above - cited reviews , also cranmer 2002 ; hollweg & isenberg 2002 ; marsch 2005 ) .    despite the potentially clumsy `` averaging '' over real kinetic effects",
    ", we believe the one - fluid approach is the _ most consistent with our present state of knowledge _ about the primary source of energy deposition : mhd turbulent cascade .",
    "there are a number of competing ideas in the literature regarding how the cascade proceeds to its smallest kinetic scales and how either linear or nonlinear damping transfers wave energy to the particles ( for a recent summary see ",
    "5.2.4 of kohl et al .   2006 ) .",
    "we thus do not yet know , from first principles , how to partition the cascaded wave energy between particle species ( @xmath7 ) and between various directions in microscopic velocity space ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "performing such partitioning at the present time would essentially add new free parameters into the model .",
    "our adopted rate of alfvnic coronal heating ( eq .  [ [ eq : dmit ] ] ) thus deals only with the total energy flux that cascades from large to small scales and not the specific means of dissipation once the energy reaches the small scales .",
    "the equations governing the expansion of a time - steady stellar wind are derivable by taking successive velocity moments of the boltzmann equation , together with some assumption about the shape of the velocity distribution function in order to close the otherwise infinite chain of moment equations ( see , e.g. , braginskii 1965 ; collins 1989 ; marsch 2005 ) . in this section",
    "we describe the conservation equations used in the models (   3.1 ) and the adopted prescriptions for heat transport due to radiation (   3.2 ) and conduction (   3.3 ) .",
    "we consider the flow of a pure hydrogen plasma along a radially oriented magnetic field .",
    "the goal is to solve for the time - steady radial dependence of the mass density @xmath9 , the bulk flow speed @xmath5 , and the maxwellian temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the distance along the magnetic flux tube is denoted either as @xmath10 , measured from sun - center , or @xmath11 , measured from the lower boundary of the model in the solar atmosphere ( essentially the photosphere ) . for completeness",
    ", the equations below contain the dependence on time @xmath12 , though these terms are set to zero in the time - independent solutions that we describe below .",
    "the equation of mass conservation is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the cross - sectional area of the one - dimensional flux tube along which the wind flows .",
    "magnetic flux conservation demands that the product @xmath15 is constant along the flux tube , where @xmath16 is the field strength that we specify explicitly ( see   8) .",
    "a time - steady one - dimensional flow thus constrains the product @xmath17 to be proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "the equation of momentum conservation is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gas pressure , @xmath21 is the newtonian gravitation constant , and @xmath22 is the mass of the star .",
    "the mass of the plasma in the modeled stellar wind region is assumed to be negligible from a gravitational standpoint . also , @xmath23 is the bulk acceleration on the plasma due to _ wave pressure ; _ i.e. , the nondissipative net ponderomotive force due to the propagation of waves through an inhomogeneous medium (   6 ) .",
    "the equation of internal energy conservation is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the internal energy density and the terms on the right - hand side are volumetric heating / cooling rates due to radiation , conduction , alfvn wave damping , and acoustic ( sound ) wave damping .",
    "the terms on the left - hand side that depend on @xmath5 are responsible for enthalpy transport and adiabatic cooling in the accelerating wind .",
    "the coupling of the above equations requires additional constitutive relations to be specified : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is boltzmann s constant and a monatomic ratio of specific heats @xmath30 is used .",
    "the total particle number density @xmath31 is given by the sum of the hydrogen number density @xmath32 and the electron density @xmath33 , and the number densities of neutral hydrogen and protons are denoted @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . for the pure hydrogen plasma assumed in this paper , @xmath36 .",
    "the mass density is given by @xmath37 , although the second term is safely considered to be negligible .",
    "note that equation  ( [ eq : edef ] ) becomes the ideal gas relation @xmath38 in the purely neutral limit , where @xmath39 is the specific heat at constant volume .",
    "ionization is taken into account by the internal energy s dependence on @xmath40 , the ionization potential of hydrogen from the ground level ( 13.6 ev ) .",
    "we use the same convention in the definition of @xmath25 as ulmschneider & muchmore ( 1986 ) and mullan & cheng ( 1993 ) .",
    "an alternate definition of the internal energy is possible , though , which is essentially given by @xmath41 .",
    "this version reduces to the above ideal - gas relation in the limit of a fully ionized plasma ( e.g. , mcclymont & canfield 1983 ; fontenla et al .",
    "either definition is consistent with the combined equations of mass and energy conservation given above .",
    "we adopted a relatively simple prescription to compute the ionization fraction @xmath42 .",
    "this quantity is parameterized as a tabulated function of @xmath6 only , where we have used the ionization balance from a recent semi - empirical model of the solar photosphere , chromosphere , and transition region ( e.   avrett 2005 , private communication ; see also fontenla et al .   1993 , 2002 , 2006 ) .",
    "the tabulated model we use is a modified version of the quiet - sun model c from the above papers , and it is the same one used by cranmer & van ballegooijen ( 2005 ) to model the magnetic structure of the chromospheric network . for convenience",
    "we call this model fal - c@xmath43 .",
    "figure 1 shows the adopted ionization fraction @xmath44 , as well as the corresponding neutral fraction @xmath45 ( in order to see small departures from total ionization at high temperatures ) and the radiative cooling function that was derived in part from the fal - c@xmath43 model ( see   3.2 ) . for temperatures below the minimum tabulated value of about 4500 k , we prevent @xmath44 from decreasing below a minimum value of @xmath46 , because photoionization is expected to always keep some small fraction of metals ionized at and above the photosphere .",
    "we tested the zephyr code with a more self - consistent model of the hydrogen ionization balance .",
    "the results were extremely similar , though , to those using the tabulated fraction shown in figure 1 .",
    "this model consisted of a three - level hydrogen atom , where the @xmath47 and @xmath48 levels were assumed to remain in relative local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and the full rate equation between @xmath48 and the continuum was solved iteratively with collisional and radiative terms from hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) , vriens & smeets ( 1980 ) , ferland et al .",

    "2003 ) .    in order to ensure that the optically thin parts of the atmosphere would smoothly approach radiative equilibrium ( in the absence of nonradiative heating ) in the same way as in the optically thick parts of the atmosphere , we multiplied the standard cooling function by the term in parentheses in equation ( [ eq : qradthin ] ) . for temperatures above @xmath79",
    "this correction factor rapidly approaches unity .",
    "note from figure 1 that there is no isolated `` lyman alpha peak '' at temperatures of 12 @xmath80 k. for solar atmosphere models , this peak seems to be a spurious feature that appears in optically thin radiative loss curves computed without a radiation field .",

    "the computation of the radiative cooling rate is in a similar situation as the ionization fraction discussed in ",
    "our use of tabulated quantities from fal - c@xmath43 seems to be reasonable for modeling the solar atmosphere , but it will eventually need to be replaced with a more self - consistent procedure . specifically , evolved low - gravity stars with high mass loss rates are expected to have more optically thick chromospheres .",
    "hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 ) , canfield & ricchiazzi ( 1980 ) , and mullan & cheng ( 1993 ) computed approximate optically thick radiation losses by taking account of reduced escape probabilities in the damping wings of strong lines ; it is possible that these methods can be extended in a robust way to future time - steady stellar wind models .",
    "for the radially oriented flux tubes that we consider , the conductive energy exchange rate is dominated by the divergence of a parallel heat flux density , i.e. , @xmath82 because the solar atmosphere undergoes a transition from being strongly collisionally coupled ( at low heights and high densities ) to being nearly collisionless ( at large heights and low densities ) , it was realized long ago that the classical spitzer - hrm ( sh ) prescription for thermal conductivity must break down somewhere in the corona and solar wind .",
    "we thus follow wang ( 1993 ) , and others , by using a semi - empirical bridging law between the sh heat flux @xmath83 and a completely collisionless `` free - streaming '' heat flux @xmath84 , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the local wind expansion rate and @xmath87 is the electron - electron coulomb collision frequency , @xmath88 ( braginskii 1965 ; olsen & leer 1996 ) .",
    "the electron coulomb logarithm is approximated by @xmath89 a more accurate version of equation  ( [ eq : qpara ] ) was derived by cuperman & dryer ( 1985 ) . under a number of simplifying approximations ,",
    "though ( such as nearly maxwellian distributions ) , their expression reduces to something very close to the above bridging formula .    the radial distance where the heat flux undergoes the transition from collisional to collisionless",
    "can be estimated by locating the point at which @xmath90 .",
    "for the models of low - density high - speed solar wind streams presented below , this occurs at about @xmath91 solar radii ( @xmath92 ) ; for the models of high - density low - speed solar wind , this occurs at @xmath9380 @xmath92 .    in the collisionally dominated limit , we assume sh conduction , @xmath94 where the thermal conductivity is assumed to be dominated by contributions from free electrons and neutral hydrogen , @xmath95 ( e.g. , nowak & ulmschneider 1977 ; mcclymont & canfield 1983 ) .",
    "the effects of protons and heavy ions are neglected because they tend to be overwhelmed by the electron conductivity in regions of appreciable ionization ( see also ulmschneider 1970 ; hansteen & leer 1995 ) .",

    "partial ionization effects ( i.e. , @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) are parameterized using the results of shmeleva & syrovatskii ( 1973 ) and mcclymont & canfield ( 1983 ) , with @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the ratio of the electron - electron collision time @xmath101 to the electron - neutral hydrogen time @xmath102 , and @xmath103 similarly , the neutral hydrogen conductivity is given by @xmath104 the above partial ionization effects are generally unimportant in the solar atmosphere , but we include them for some attempt at completeness , and with anticipation that the cooler and more optically thick chromospheres of other stars may depend more sensitively on them .",
    "in the collisionless limit we use the free - streaming heat flux derived for escaping electrons by hollweg ( 1974 , 1976 ) , which was based on empirical constraints from forslund ( 1970 ) and perkins ( 1973 ) on the electron velocity distribution , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is an order - unity correction factor that depends on how the wings of the electron velocity distribution depart from a maxwellian shape . we take a constant value of @xmath107 as has been often used in solar wind modeling ( see , e.g. , leer et al .   1982 ; scudder & olbert 1983 ; withbroe 1988 ; canullo et al .   1996 ; landi & pantellini 2003 ) .",

    "finally , propagation effects between the photosphere and the transition region ( @xmath277 in the model of cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 ) were taken into account by solving the combined non - wkb kink - mode and alfvn - mode transport equations for an empirically constrained ( fal - c@xmath43 ) background plasma state .",
    "there are several noteworthy features of the spectrum @xmath275 in figure 3 .",

    "there is growing evidence that the low - frequency fluctuations seen in interplanetary space may be the result of the passage of multiple uncorrelated flux tubes past the spacecraft and not intrinsic turbulence within any one flux tube ( see , e.g. , mccracken & ness 1966 ; jokipii & parker 1969 ; bruno et al .",

    "the mass loss rate is primarily dependent on @xmath388 , which represents the total amount of alfvnic wave energy available to be dissipated in the corona .",
    "the outflow speed , though , seems to depend mainly on @xmath389 ; this parameter tells us _ where _ the wave energy is damped . for large values of @xmath389",
    "the damping occurs over a large range of heights , with increasingly more heating and acceleration taking place above the critical point .",
    "it has been known for some time that the relative heights of the critical point and the dominant energy deposition are key in determining the nature of a pressure - driven wind ( leer & holzer 1980 ; pneuman 1980 ; leer et al .   1982 ) .",
    "heat that is deposited _ above _ the critical point is converted nearly completely into kinetic energy of the wind ( and a higher value of @xmath393 ) .",
    "on the other hand , low values of @xmath389 give a more concentrated heat deposition mostly _ below _ the critical point .",
    "this energy raises the temperature in the subsonic part of the corona , increases its scale height , and provides more downward heat conduction into the upper transition region .",

    "interestingly , for a large range of parameters in the lower - right of figure 6b ( @xmath396 km and @xmath397 km / s ) , a combined power - law fit to the parameter dependence of the mass loss rate yields good agreement with the zephyr models for @xmath398 .",
    "this resembles the classical kolmogorov ( 1941 ) energy flux due to isotropic hydrodynamic turbulence : @xmath399 .",
    "it seems to corroborate the general idea that the mass flux of a thermally driven wind is proportional to the deposited coronal energy flux . the large variation in coronal heating , though , does _ not _ seem to produce a large variation in the maximum coronal temperature .",
    "figure 6c shows that this temperature varies only by about a factor of two over most of the parameter space .",
    "owocki ( 2004 ) summarized how the energy losses due to both conduction and the solar wind act as an effective `` thermostat '' to keep the coronal temperature from varying too widely .",
    "figure 7 illustrates how the coronal heating rate @xmath302 changes as @xmath388 is varied and @xmath389 is kept fixed .",
    "we plot the heating rate per unit mass @xmath400 in order to more easily show which heights receive the most heating on a particle - by - particle basis .",
    "note that larger values of @xmath388 produce larger values of both @xmath400 and @xmath6 and move their local maxima down to lower heights .",
    "the presence of damping , though , leads to differences in how the heating rate depends on @xmath388 in various regions . in the lower corona ( @xmath401 ) , before substantial alfvn - wave damping has had time to occur , the three models show a power - law dependence of @xmath402 that is similar to the mass loss rate dependence of @xmath403 for these models .",
    "in the extended corona , though , the _ peak value _ of @xmath400 ( above @xmath404 ) varies more weakly as @xmath405 .",
    "the models with higher alfvn wave amplitudes have undergone relatively more damping in the extended corona than the models with lower @xmath225 .",
    "the above arguments do not explain all of the features of the contours shown in figure 6 .",
    "for example , although there is a general trend ( in the center and lower - right of figure 6b ) for a decreasing @xmath389 to give a larger value of @xmath395 , the globally largest mass loss rate occurs in the upper - right corner of the plot  i.e .",
    ", for the largest values of _ both _ @xmath388 and @xmath389 . in this region of the plot ,",
    "added insight can be found in the `` cold '' wave - driven wind model of holzer et al .",
    "for undamped alfvn waves that dominate the critical velocity ( eq .   [ [ eq : ucrit ] ] ) the terminal wind speed and mass loss rate can be computed analytically . isolating the proportionality with @xmath388 in this",
    "model yields @xmath406 where the constant term is typically negligible , thus giving @xmath407 ( see eqs .   [ 39 ] and [ 41 ] of holzer et al .   1983 ) .",
    "in the upper - right corners of figures 6a and 6b , these relations come the closest to being satisfied . specifically , for @xmath408 km s@xmath57 and @xmath409 km",
    ", the best power - law fits to the model results are @xmath410 and @xmath411 .",
    "these parameters indeed correspond to a wave - dominated critical velocity ( i.e. , large @xmath388 ) without much damping ( large @xmath389 ) .    for the entire grid of values shown in figure 6 ,",
    "a power - law is a poor fit to the overall variations of @xmath395 and @xmath393 as a function of the two input parameters . for completeness , though , we report the best - fitting exponents over the full grid : @xmath412 and @xmath413 .",
    "we produced a second grid of exploratory zephyr models that kept the coronal heating parameters ( @xmath388 , @xmath389 ) fixed and varied only the basal acoustic wave flux @xmath380 . as described further in   8.3 , we chose optimal values of @xmath414 km s@xmath57 and @xmath415 km in order to model the fast wind that emerges from a polar coronal hole ( see also the stars in figure 6 ) . for the median value of @xmath416 erg s@xmath57 @xmath383 used above , the transition region occurs at a relatively large height of @xmath417 .",
    "a traditional view of chromospheric energy balance is that when the acoustic heating is increased , the height of the transition region should decrease ( since the temperature would rise more rapidly as a function of @xmath11 ) .",
    "figure 8 shows that the _ opposite _ actually occurs when we vary @xmath380 and keep everything else fixed .",
    "we produced a series of models with @xmath418 , @xmath419 , @xmath381 , @xmath390 , @xmath382 , and @xmath420 erg s@xmath57 @xmath383 , as well as a model with @xmath421 ( i.e. , a model with alfvn wave heating only ) .",
    "the models with @xmath421 and @xmath422 are virtually identical and the latter is not shown .    before discussing the chromospheric heating",
    ", we first note that the coronal and solar wind parameters for these models are remarkably constant .",
    "this shows that varying the acoustic heating has relatively little impact above the transition region . as @xmath380",
    "is increased from zero to its maximum value , the mass loss rate decreases by only 7% , the terminal speed increases by less than 1% , and the peak coronal temperature decreases by 5% .    why does the transition region height increase as additional chromospheric heating is imposed ?",
    "the models having larger values of @xmath380 have _ larger scale heights _ because they have both larger chromospheric temperatures and higher acoustic wave pressures .",
    "the larger scale heights lead to a more shallow density decrease in the approximately hydrostatic chromosphere . the transition region tends to occur at a critical density at which radiative cooling can no longer keep pace with the imposed acoustic heating ( i.e. , because @xmath78 has reached its peak and can increase no further ) .",
    "the `` shallower '' models with more acoustic heating reach this critical density at a larger height .",
    "the modeled transition region heights @xmath423 range from 3800 km ( for @xmath421 ) to 11500 km ( for @xmath424 erg s@xmath57 @xmath383 ) .",
    "for consistency , we define @xmath423 as the height where @xmath6 first reaches @xmath425 k , which is the peak of the radiative cooling curve ; see figure 1",
    ". these heights are conspicuously larger than the standard values of , e.g. , 1700 to 2300 km from `` fal '' semi - empirical solar atmosphere models ( fontenla et al .",
    "1993 ) . although there are some solar limb observations that suggest large values similar to our modeled @xmath423 ( zhang et al .",
    "1998 ) , these may be affected by the dynamics of spicules and mass flows along closed magnetic loops , and thus may not be comparable directly to the present models ( see also filippov & koutchmy 2000 ) .",
    "the relative stretching of the chromospheres shown in figure 8 can be understood further by examining the density dependence of the total heating rate : @xmath426 .",
    "the exponent @xmath427 was computed for all of the models by utilizing the radial dependence of both @xmath9 and the total heating rate , with @xmath428 because the heating is balanced by radiative cooling ( which usually has @xmath429 ) , we find that values of @xmath427 closer to 2 give rise to a more extended `` matching '' between heating and cooling at chromospheric temperatures  and thus a larger overall extent of the chromosphere .",
    "thus , since @xmath430 for all of the models shown below , we can understand how larger [ smaller ] values of @xmath427 correspond to a higher [ lower ] transition region height .",
    "for the shock heating described in   4.1 , the possible values of @xmath427 range between 0.5 and @xmath4311",
    ". the lower limit would occur for an undamped weak shock train , for which @xmath432 ( eq .   [ [ eq : wst ] ] ) and @xmath433 .",
    "the upper limit occurs when the shock train strengthens to the point where @xmath162 saturates to a nearly constant value and thus @xmath434 .",
    "( the peak mach number @xmath163 tends to saturate at values between 2 and 3 for the majority of the @xmath380 models . )    the zephyr models shown in figure 8 exhibit intermediate values of the density exponent @xmath427 , with the value of the exponent varying slightly as a function of height in the chromosphere .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath423 corresponds to the @xmath421 model and @xmath4350.5 .",
    "the highest value of @xmath423 corresponds to the @xmath424 model and @xmath4361 .",
    "it is clear that , in these models , an even lower ( fal - like ) transition region height would require @xmath437 , and thus would require the heating rate to increase with height .",
    "such heating may occur for the following reasons .    1 .",
    "as described above , if the acoustic wave energy were to act more like a weak undamped shock train , @xmath427 would approach 0.5 .",
    "the emerging picture of the chromosphere as a confluence of multiple acoustic sources ( each expanding quasi - spherically from small regions at or below the photosphere ) may be consistent with the need for more low - amplitude acoustic wave energy ( see , e.g. , ulmschneider et al .",
    "a collection of weak and incoherent acoustic wave packets may also exhibit effectively larger frequencies because of their random phases and constructive interference .",
    "2 .   there could be additional important sources of linear wave dissipation in the low chromosphere , similar in form to @xmath133 ( which gives @xmath438 to 0.5 depending on the magnetic geometry ) .",
    "for example , goodman ( 2000 , 2004 ) suggested that the resistive dissipation of currents driven by mhd waves may provide enough energy to heat the chromosphere .",
    "similarly , it has been argued on the basis of multiple lines of observational evidence that both solar and stellar chromospheres may be dominated by magnetic and not acoustic heating ( e.g. , judge & carpenter 1998 ; judge et al .",
    "2003 ; bercik et al .",
    "if these mechanisms grow stronger as one moves from the lower to the upper chromosphere ( the latter being more strongly ionized and magnetized ) , this could produce the radial increase of the total heating rate that would be needed to push down the transition region .",
    "however , we should note that anderson & athay ( 1989a ) determined empirically that the chromospheric heating rate seems to be roughly proportional to @xmath9 ( and thus @xmath439 ) throughout most of the chromosphere .",
    "the mechanisms included in the zephyr models may thus be reasonable without the need for additional physics .",
    "we experimented with several other variations on the acoustic heating in order to test the assumptions described in   4 .",
    "a test model was created with the power spectrum @xmath190 divided into a finer mesh of discrete frequency bins : separated by factors of @xmath440 rather than 2 .",
    "this model , which had @xmath416 erg s@xmath57 @xmath383 , produced a nearly identical chromosphere to the standard model with the same value of @xmath380 .",
    "the fine - mesh model s transition region height @xmath423 was about 10% higher than that of the standard model because slightly more power was given to the lower frequencies ( which form shocks at larger heights ) .",
    "presumably , using a coarser frequency spectrum would lead to a lower value of @xmath423 , but this would start to become unfaithful to the modeled spectral shape ( eq .   [ [ eq : pomegas ] ] ) .",
    "another model was run with just a single frequency bin ; i.e. , a monochromatic low - frequency wave train with @xmath441 .",
    "this model was designed to explore what would happen if the high - frequency tail in @xmath190 were absent ( e.g. , fossum & carlsson 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "this model exhibited @xmath442 km , about a factor of two larger than the standard model , and would certainly require some additional kind of chromospheric heating to produce a realistically low value of @xmath423 .",
    "note that for all of the above models the minimum temperature in the upper photosphere never dropped below the radiative equilibrium value of @xmath145 k. there is observational evidence , though , for a lower minimum temperature that could extend intermittently down to values between 3000 to 4000 k ( see model a of fontenla et al .",
    "1993 ; carlsson & stein 1997 ; as well as recent work by ayres et al .   2006 ; fontenla et al .",
    "additional sources of cooling that could be included in zephyr include molecular opacity and dust formation ( for cooler stars ) as well as adiabatic expansion effects due to waves and shocks that may _ not _ be confined to the modeled flux tube .",
    "the exploratory models discussed above led to a choice for the optimal set of parameters which would reproduce the observed properties of high - speed solar wind streams that emerge from polar coronal holes ( mainly at the minimum of the solar cycle ) .",

    "some of this difference can be attributed directly to the varying flux - tube area factors @xmath265 ( i.e. , different manifestations of wave action conservation ) .",
    "however , the equatorial flux tube also exhibits relatively more damping than the polar model . in the corona",
    ", the alfvn waves essentially `` spend more time '' at low heights in the equatorial flux tube because of its lower phase speed ( @xmath505 ) , and this allows a given damping rate @xmath302 to have more of an impact on diminishing the wave energy .",
    "thus , the equatorial models exhibit more heating at low heights ( due to the increased damping and the higher densities at the coronal base ) and less heating at large heights ( due to the lower wave amplitudes @xmath225 and larger turbulent correlation lengths @xmath237 in the extended corona ) .",
    "the peak temperature for the polar model , @xmath506 mk , occurs at @xmath507 , and the peak temperature for the equatorial model , @xmath508 mk , has a similar magnitude but occurs at a lower height of @xmath509 ( see also figure 17 below ) .",
    "this shift in the range of heights over which coronal heating occurs seems to be an important factor in producing a fast solar wind for the polar model ( which is heated in the supersonic region ) and a slow wind for the equatorial model ( which is heated in the subsonic region ) ; see   8.1 .",
    "the differences in temperature persist out to 1 au , where the polar temperature ( 0.41 mk ) exceeds the equatorial temperature ( 0.16 mk ) by a larger relative amount than in the extended corona . the radial temperature exponent @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath510 ) grows steeper from pole ( @xmath473 ) to equator ( @xmath511 ) .",
    "although the photospheric alfvn wave amplitude parameter @xmath388 was kept fixed in these models , the degree of non - wkb reflection decreased slightly from the polar to the equatorial flux tube .",
    "this resulted in a decrease in the computed value of @xmath446 ( eq .   [ [ eq : wperp ] ] ) from its polar value of 0.72 km s@xmath57 to an equatorial value of 0.59 km s@xmath57 .",
    "interestingly , if we could have forced @xmath446 to remain fixed as a function of latitude , the resulting equatorial value of @xmath388 would have been about 20% _ larger _ than the polar value . figure 6",
    "indicates that the effect would have been an even larger equatorial mass loss rate and a slightly lower @xmath393 .",
    "thus , the current set of models is in some sense `` robust '' because these effects arise even without such an extra fine - tuning in @xmath446 .",
    "the detailed latitudinal dependence of the zephyr models ( for an observer in interplanetary space ) is shown in figure 12 .",

    ", one can estimate this latitude as @xmath515 .",
    "there are two sets of pole - to - equator zephyr models shown in figure 12 .",
    "we compare the standard model discussed above with a preliminary model presented by cranmer ( 2006 ) , which we hereafter call the `` durham '' model .",
    "the models differ in two specific ways .",
    "( 1 ) the standard model used the alfvn wave frequency spectrum shown in figure 3 , but the durham model assumed a single frequency for the alfvn waves  corresponding to a period of 6 minutes .",
    "( 2 ) the standard model used an exponent @xmath47 in equation ( [ eq : eturb ] ) , but the durham model used @xmath48 .",
    "the latter was an early guess for the functional form of @xmath240 that we used prior to the incorporation of the insights of oughton et al .",
    "the larger exponent resulted in more efficient quenching of the mhd turbulence in the lower atmosphere , which thus required a larger amount of alfvn wave energy to produce plasma conditions appropriate for a polar coronal hole . specifically , the durham model used @xmath516 km s@xmath57 , @xmath517 km , and the same value of @xmath380 as was used in the standard model .",
    "the durham model s @xmath393 and @xmath395 for the polar flux tube were nearly identical to those of the standard model .",
    "the peak coronal temperature , though , was substantially larger ( 2.06 mk ) and the temperature at 1 au was slightly smaller ( 0.31 mk ) in comparison to the standard polar model .",
    "there is reasonably good agreement between the modeled and observed plasma properties shown in figure 12 .",
    "we of course do not reproduce any of the measured north - south asymmetry in the data , except for that in @xmath518 that arose because the path of _ ulysses _ was not perfectly north - south symmetric .",
    "we also do not attempt to model the rapid near - ecliptic variability that seems to result from longitudinal variations in @xmath16 . in some sense , the durham model does better at achieving the low equatorial wind speeds ( down to 330 km s@xmath57 ) and high number densities ( up to about 10 @xmath327 ) that are often observed in the plane of the ecliptic , but that model exhibits a narrower range of slow - wind ( large-@xmath296 ) latitudes than both the standard model and the _ ulysses _ data .",
    "it is expected , though , that some fraction of the observed @xmath519 latitudinal extent of the slow - wind region may be due to a slight tilt in the main dipole component of the solar magnetic field ( i.e. , a `` ballerina skirt '' phenomenon ) because the first _ ulysses _ polar pass did not occur exactly at the minimum of the activity cycle .",
    "note from figure 12c that the zephyr model temperatures between 1.3 and 2.3 au are systematically higher than the measured values of @xmath518 .",
    "the trend as a function of the coupled distance - latitude coordinate , though , is similar to the measurements .",
    "our heliospheric temperatures are sensitive to the adopted method of bridging between collisional and collisionless heat conduction ( eq .   [ [ eq : qpara ] ] ) and the present method is admittedly somewhat ad  hoc . however , some of the discrepancy in figure 12c may come from the fact that @xmath520 in interplanetary space and that we are essentially modeling their average . in  situ measurements",

    "the discrepancy is worst in the polar , fast - wind regions where our modeled average temperature would exceed _ both _ the observed @xmath518 and @xmath523 .",
    "however , the zephyr code does not yet contain the dissipative physical processes that would lead to temperature equilibration between protons and electrons ; these may alter subtly both the net heating and the form of the conduction flux @xmath524 .",
    "figure 13 plots the terminal speeds of the standard and durham zephyr models as a function of the wang - sheeley superradial expansion factor @xmath496 .",
    "the abrupt changes in @xmath393 that occur because of the emergence of the outer critical point are evident as vertical discontinuities at the critical values of @xmath489 . because of the relatively narrow range of @xmath496 values subtended by the pole - to - equator ( banaszkiewicz et al .",

    "it is difficult to process the richly nonlinear turbulent fluctuations ( as measured in  situ ) into a single `` amplitude , '' so we made an attempt to convert the zephyr values of @xmath225 into something analogous to the frequency - averaged elsasser spectrum quantities reported by tu et al .",

    "first , representative spectral shapes for these fluctuations were used in order to determine how much of the total energy is contributed by the specified frequency band ( 1@xmath528 hz ) .",

    "appear to agree quite nicely .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we discuss two supplementary calculations of in  situ quantities that are often used to diagnose the properties of fast and slow wind streams : the ionization fraction ( figure 15 ) and the fip effect ( figure 16 ) .",

    "figure 15 shows the ratio of o@xmath479 to o@xmath480 number densities as a function of the modeled terminal speed .",
    "these are compared to statistical summaries of _ ulysses _ swics ( solar wind ion composition spectrometer ; gloeckler et al .",
    "1992 ) measurements of this ratio taken during two time periods : the first polar pass discussed above ( september 1994 to august 1995 ) and the initial phase of the mission that sampled the peak of the solar cycle ( december 1990 to september 1994 ) .",
    "the data points , obtained from the online database of t.   zurbuchen and r.   von steiger ( see also von steiger et al .   2000 ) , were grouped in sequential bins of wind speed of size 25 km s@xmath57 , and the mean and standard deviation of the ionization ratio in each bin were computed .",
    "the regions plotted in figure 15 show the values within @xmath535 standard deviations of the mean for each bin in the two data sets .",
    "the general trend of the pole - to - equator zephyr models is for lower wind speeds to have higher ratios of o@xmath479 to o@xmath480 at 1 au , in qualitative agreement with the observations .",
    "the absolute values of the modeled ionization ratios , though , are up to an order of magnitude lower than the _",
    "ulysses _ measurements , with slightly better agreement for the hotter durham models .",
    "this discrepancy may be the result of our simple assumption of maxwellian electron distributions and equal flow speeds for all ion charge states ( see , e.g. , esser & edgar 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "a ubiquitous weak `` halo '' of suprathermal electrons in the low corona could be responsible for the larger overall degree of ionization that is observed .    as one moves from the polar flux tube to the middle latitudes ( i.e. , from @xmath536 km s@xmath57 down to about 650 km s@xmath57 ) the modeled ionization ratio decreases , but then as one passes the bifurcation point between the low and high critical radii , the ionization ratio increases for the rest of the way from the mid - latitude region to the equator .",
    "the overall trend for slow wind to have a high ionization ratio is expected because of the higher temperatures in the narrow zone just above the transition region .",
    "in fact , the temperature at a constant height of @xmath537 has the same quantitative trend as the modeled o@xmath479 to o@xmath480 ratios : there is an initial decrease from the polar model ( 0.37 mk ) to just before the bifurcation latitude ( 0.28 mk ) , then an abrupt jump back to nearly the polar value ( 0.34 mk ) followed by a steady increase toward the equatorial flux tube ( 0.46 mk ) .",
    "the freezing in occurs at about this height , so it makes sense that the ionization state tracks these variations .",
    "notice that this ionization ratio is sensitive only to the temperature trends at low heights ( and that the o@xmath479 to o@xmath480 ratio freezes in just above the transition region ) and is _ not _ sensitive to the temperatures at larger heights in most of the extended corona .",
    "some interpretations of the in  situ charge states make the implicit assumption that high electron temperatures in the slow wind must persist all the way through the extended corona into interplanetary space , and our models show that this need not be the case .",
    "a specific diagnostic of _ fip fractionation _ has been computed for each of the standard and durham model flux tubes .",
    "figure 16 shows a commonly measured ratio of the abundances of a low - fip element ( fe , 7.9 ev ) and a moderately high - fip element ( o , 13.6 ev ) normalized to their photospheric abundance ratio .",
    "we solved equation ( [ eq : lamfip ] ) as described in   6 , and by laming ( 2004 ) , for the various models and compared the ratios to the _ ulysses _ swics observations of the fe / o ratio .",
    "the swics ratio was normalized to an assumed photospheric iron - to - oxygen abundance ratio of 0.0468 ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) and the modeled quantity is naturally in units of the photospheric ratio . because the fip fractionation takes place in the uppermost part of the chromosphere ( which is largely optically thin ) and the very low transition region , we assumed `` coronal '' ionization equilibrium to hold for the modeled fe and o ions .",
    "we used the code developed by cranmer ( 2000 ) to compute the fe and o ionization fractions @xmath306 that are used in equation ( [ eq : lamfip ] ) ; the rates were taken largely from mazzotta et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    figure 16 shows that our standard pole - to - equator zephyr model exhibits a roughly constant fe / o ratio of about 2 for outflow speeds between 500 and 750 km s@xmath57 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the _ ulysses _ data , which have a roughly constant mean value of about 1.5 over these speeds .",
    "the durham model varies nonmonotonically between ratios of about 3 and 5.5 over its wider range of outflow speeds and is clearly inconsistent with most of the in  situ data .",
    "the equatorial durham model , with @xmath538 km s@xmath57 , does seem to fall into agreement with the measured data , but the overall trend as a function of wind speed is not the same . the most promising models for matching the observed trend for a steep enhancement of the fe / o ratio ( as the wind speed decreases from 500 to 300 km s@xmath57 ) appear to be the active - region flux tubes discussed below in   8.5 .",
    "we should note that an alternate theoretical explanation for fip fractionation may also be consistent with the zephyr models .",
    "wang ( 1996 ) proposed that flux tubes with a stronger degree of downward heat conduction in the low corona could give rise to a larger amount of transient evaporative outflow of protons relative to neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "these protons could collisionally dredge up singly ionized species ( which are preferentially low - fip ) from the transition region and upper chromosphere . in our models ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath539 occurs within the transition region ( at @xmath540 k ) , and in the equatorial models this peak value is consistently _ larger _ than in the polar models .",
    "the ratio of equatorial to polar maximum conduction rates is 1.7 for the standard model and 2.8 for the durham model . whether this is enough to produce a fip effect with wang s ( 1996 ) mechanism",
    "is not known , but the variations are at least in the correct qualitative direction to produce more of an effect in the slow wind than in the fast wind .",
    "note , though , that schwadron et al .",
    "( 1999 ) disagree with some of the basic assumptions of the wang ( 1996 ) mechanism , and a definitive explanation for the fip effect remains elusive .",
    "there are additional observational diagnostics that appear to be correlated with fast and slow wind speeds .",
    "kojima et al .   ( 2004 ) and suzuki ( 2006 ) found that the ratio of basal magnetic field strength to the superradial flux - tube divergence factor ( i.e. , @xmath541 ) may be a better predictor of solar wind speed than just using @xmath496 itself ( see , however , wang & sheeley 2006 ) .",
    "mcintosh & leamon ( 2005 ) found that the difference in formation heights between the emission seen in the _ trace _ 1600  and 1700  filter bandpasses could be a useful diagnostic of the eventual wind speed in flux tubes that are associated with specific regions on the solar surface .",
    "although there have been numerous observational inferences of blueshifts ( i.e. , outflow ) in various spectral lines , it is unclear to what degree these may be utilized as empirical `` lower boundary conditions '' for solar wind flux tubes ( see reviews by peter et al .",
    "2004 ; jones 2005 ) . finally , there are definite fast / slow wind correlations in the wealth of existing turbulence measurements  both in  situ and remote sensing  that could be key tests of models that use waves and turbulence for energy and momentum deposition .",
    "future development of the zephyr models will encompass such additional comparisons .      at times other than solar minimum",
    ", the coronal magnetic field is substantially more complex than the axisymmetric configuration modeled in the previous section . during the approach to solar maximum",
    "the large polar coronal holes disappear as magnetic flux of the opposite polarity is brought toward the poles .",
    "active regions with strong fields emerge at all latitudes and give rise to an interconnected web of closed loops and intermittent open flux tubes . in the extended corona",
    ", active regions often have the appearance of cusp - like `` active streamers '' that seem like smaller , more intense versions of the quiescent equatorial streamers that dominate at solar minimum ( newkirk 1967 ; liewer et al .",

    "there is increasing evidence that much of the slow solar wind is connected somehow to open flux tubes that are rooted in or near active regions ( e.g. , neugebauer et al .",

    "2004 ) .",
    "we investigated several different ways to model active - region flux tubes with the zephyr code .",
    "first , we explored just changing the radial location of the cusp in the equatorial banaszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) flux tube .",
    "observationally , streamers exhibit a wide range of cusp heights which gives rise to a large variation in their rates of superradial expansion .",
    "the cusp height was varied by first computing the ratio of the equatorial ( @xmath491 ) to the polar ( @xmath490 ) magnetic fields @xmath542 , as shown in figure 5 , then shifting the height coordinate @xmath11 either upward or downward by a constant multiplier . the `` new '' equatorial field",
    "was obtained by taking the product of this shifted ratio and the polar field strength . changing the cusp height by up to",
    "a factor of two in either direction did not have much of an effect on the resulting solar wind properties .",
    "the mass loss rates varied by about 18% for these models ( lower cusps having lower @xmath395 ) , whereas the terminal speeds @xmath393 varied by less than 3% .",
    "this near constancy in the solar wind speed occurred despite the fact that @xmath496 was made to increase and decrease by factors of @xmath2172 about the equatorial value of 9.1 .",
    "the above models can not be considered true active - streamer models because they were not given the significantly _ stronger _ mean magnetic field strengths that active regions are observed to have in the lower atmosphere . on the smallest scales in the photosphere , plage and active regions",
    "exhibit a much higher filling factor of strong - field flux concentrations than quiet regions and coronal holes . in the most tightly - packed active regions",
    "these flux concentrations do not appear as isolated flux tubes but instead as fluted ribbons , buckled flux sheets , and flower - like patterns ( e.g. , berger et al .",
    "2004 ; rouppe van der voort et al .",
    "we are concerned here only with the subset of magnetic flux that extends out into interplanetary space , so we provisionally retain the `` flux tube '' picture .",
    "we thus modeled @xmath488 in an active - region flux tube by enhancing the field strength in the chromosphere and low corona .",
    "this is done in general agreement with the larger observed magnetic fields , but also to account for the smaller area @xmath265 subtended by open flux tubes that are `` crowded '' by neighboring closed loops in active regions .",

    "the model with @xmath547 is equivalent to the standard equatorial model with no active - field enhancement .",
    "equation ( [ eq : bactive ] ) takes the greater of the two magnetic field quantities , which tends to retain the original @xmath548 in the photosphere , low chromosphere , and outer corona and wind , but produces the active - region enhancement in the upper chromosphere and low corona ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the smallest values of the scale height ( @xmath549 ) do not produce any enhancement in @xmath18 because the quantity @xmath550 is rapidly decreasing and it never exceeds @xmath548 . for larger values of @xmath546 , the magnetic field strength at the coronal base",
    "is enhanced and thus the wang - sheeley expansion factor @xmath496 is enhanced as well .",

    "thus , the iteration with the lowest value of @xmath342 did not necessarily represent the `` best '' single solution . in order to evaluate the most likely time - steady plasma parameters",

    "as @xmath546 is increased , the standard deviation first decreases from about 20 to 6 km s@xmath57 , then increases again to 35 km s@xmath57 .",
    "it is unclear whether the nonconvergence of the large-@xmath546 active region models represents a failing of the numerical technique or an intrinsic lack of a steady - state solution .",
    "the coronal sources of slow solar wind are traditionally viewed as more variable and filamentary than the source regions of fast wind .",
    "high - resolution coronagraphic observations of streamers reveal an almost continual release of low - contrast density inhomogeneities ( sheeley et al .",

    "the specific functional form of the @xmath16 enhancement in the low corona can be improved in order to agree with , e.g. , force - free magnetic field reconstructions of active regions ( schrijver et al .",
    "in addition , the photospheric field strength may also be substantially higher in active regions than elsewhere .",
    "it is unclear at first glance how the photospheric wave fluxes would be modified in these regions , though . for strong enough basal fields ( i.e. , in sunspots )",
    "convection is quenched and the wave fluxes should be lower . however , active regions exhibit a larger degree of magnetic flux emergence ( e.g. , abramenko et al .   2006 ) which could increase the frequency of impulsive horizontal `` jumps '' exhibited by flux - tube footpoints . as summarized above , flux tubes are more more highly concentrated in active - region intergranular lanes than elsewhere .",
    "the close presence of additional flux tubes may either increase the basal wave amplitude in a given tube ( via `` sympathetic '' motions from the neighbors ) or decrease it ( because large horizontal displacements are blocked by the neighbors ) .",
    "similarly , the correlation length @xmath389 in these regions may be either lower ( because of the smaller domain of motion when crowded ) or higher ( because the lane - filled `` ribbons '' may move together ) .",

    "the primary aim of this paper has been to construct self - consistent models of chromospheric and coronal heating , waves and turbulence , and wind acceleration in an open magnetic flux tube rooted in the solar photosphere .",
    "a key aspect of the zephyr models presented above is that the only true free parameters are : ( 1 ) the properties of the waves injected at the base , and ( 2 ) the background geometry and magnetic field strength along the modeled flux tubes .",
    "everything else ( e.g. , the radial dependence of the rates of chromospheric and coronal heating , the resulting temperature structure of the atmosphere , and the solar wind speed and mass flux ) is an emergent property of the model and not an ad  hoc input . in the above sense",
    ", the zephyr models are similar to those of suzuki & inutsuka ( 2005 , 2006 ) ; the differences between the two approaches involve mainly the specific physical processes that are assumed to dissipate the alfvn waves and heat the corona .    as discussed in   2 ,",
    "the zephyr models presented here are limited by being one - dimensional , time - independent , and one - fluid solutions to the hydrodynamic conservation equations , with heating that is derived only from a subset of all possible wave and turbulent dissipation processes .",
    "even so , the results given in ",
    "8 show that a realistic variation of asymptotic solar wind conditions can be produced by varying only the background magnetic field geometry , as predicted by wang & sheeley ( 1990 , 1991 , 2003 , 2006 ) .",
    "specifically , our models show general agreement with some well known empirical correlations : i.e. , a larger @xmath496 ( expansion factor ) gives rise to a slower and denser wind , less intense alfvnic fluctuations at 1 au , and larger values of both the o@xmath479/o@xmath480 charge state ratio and the fip - sensitive fe / o abundance ratio . satisfying these kinds of scalings are necessary but not sufficient conditions for validating the idea that the wind is driven by a combination of mhd turbulence and non - wkb alfvn wave reflection .",
    "future work must involve more physical realism for the models , expanded comparisons with existing observations , and predictions of as - yet unobserved quantities that may be key discriminators between competing theoretical models .",
    "an important component of all three efforts will be to model the divergent temperatures and flow speeds of protons , electrons , and various heavy ion species in the extended corona and heliosphere .",
    "these mainly _ collisionless _ regions allow the kinetic physics of wave dissipation to be probed to a level of detail not possible in a collisionally coupled ( i.e. , essentially one - fluid ) plasma . even in a perfectly collisional plasma",
    ", there can be _ macroscopic _ dynamical consequences depending on how the energy is deposited into protons , electrons , and possibly heavy ions as well .",
    "for example , if all of the heat goes into electrons , there can be substantially more downward conduction than in a proton - heated model , which would affect the coronal temperature distribution ( hansteen & leer 1995 ) and the stability of helmet streamers ( endeve et al .",
    "two - fluid effects also may affect the phenomenological form of the mhd turbulent cascade assumed in the above models ( e.g. , galtier 2006 ) .    the original motivation for this work was to understand the preferential ion heating and acceleration in the corona revealed by the uvcs ( ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ) instrument on _ soho _",
    "( kohl et al .   1995 , 1997 , 2006 ) .",
    "if mhd turbulence gives rise to cyclotron - resonant alfvn waves  which are likely to be responsible for the observed ion properties  then we must first have a large - scale description of the energy flux injected into the turbulent cascade in order to further model the end - products of that cascade .",
    "we hope to link the macroscopic properties modeled by zephyr with the microscopic kinetic processes studied by , e.g. , leamon et al .",

    "in addition to increasing the realism ( and complexity ) of the models , attempts should be made to extract the dominant physical processes of these models and create simpler `` scaling laws '' that can be used to estimate the wind conditions for varying magnetic field geometries and photospheric wave properties ( see also leer et al .",
    "1982 ; schwadron & mccomas 2003 ; suzuki 2006 ) .",
    "an obstacle to accomplishing this for the present zephyr models is that the alfvn wave reflection is nontrivially coupled to the plasma state via the alfvn speed @xmath465 and solar wind speed @xmath5 ( and their gradients ) .",

    "( 2002 ) should be tested further to evaluate ways of estimating the amount of reflection without having to solve the full non - wkb equations .",
    "we also intend to use the methodology developed here to model the winds of other kinds of stars on the cool side of the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram .",

    "[ [ eq : dmit ] ] ) is that the artificial `` damping lengths '' used in the past are no longer needed .",
    "many cool stars that exhibit observational evidence for winds have lower surface gravities than the sun , stronger x - ray emission ( i.e. , more coronal heating ) , and much larger mass loss rates .",
    "these properties are likely to be causally linked , but no comprehensive and predictive models yet exist .    in order to model cool - star winds with zephyr",
    "we must have values for the input parameters that drive the atmospheric heating and wind acceleration .",
    "for example , we must be able to predict the properties of waves at the photospheric lower boundary for a given star .",
    "amplitudes can be estimated from existing models of flux - tube wave generation from turbulent convection .",
    "figure 18 shows an example of how transverse kink - mode wave amplitudes in stellar photospheres ( for which we retain the symbol @xmath388 ) can be estimated from the peak value of the subphotospheric convective velocity @xmath566 .",

    "note that although the two velocities span many orders of magnitude they `` collapse '' into something close to a one - to - one power - law relation ( with @xmath574 ) , and that the solar value used in   8 coincides reasonably closely with the model curves .",
    "another key input to cool - star wind models is an adequate description of the large - scale magnetic field .",
