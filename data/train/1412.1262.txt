    "the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density has now been studied as far back as 1  gyr after the big bang , well into the epoch of reionization .",
    "observational constraints on both the obscured and un - obscured star - formation in galaxies are now derived from sensitive multi - wavelength observations from the uv to long radio - wavelengths . however , our current understanding of the formation of galaxies is based almost exclusively on the stars , star formation , and ionized gas in those galaxies ( e.g. , lyman - break selection , steidel et al . 1996 ; magnitude - selected samples , e.g. le fevre et al . 2005 ; lilly et al . 2007 ; narrow - band studies , e.g.  sobral et al .",
    "nevertheless , it is now also possible to obtain a coherent and unbiased census of the dense , i.e. molecular gas ( traced primarily by @xmath13co ) that is fundamentally driving the history of star formation and stellar mass buildup in galaxies  an important component that will take us towards a full physical understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies throughout cosmic time . until recently ,",
    "most observations of the dense molecular co - bright gas have been limited to targeted observations of fir - luminous quasar host galaxies and submm - selected starburst galaxies ( e.g. bothwell et al .",
    "2013 ; see review by carilli & walter 2013 ) .",
    "more recently , co has been detected in lower luminosity systems at @xmath14 ( daddi et al .",
    "2008 , 2010a ; tacconi et al .",
    "2010 , 2013 ; genzel et al .",
    "2012 ) which are claimed to be forming stars less efficiently than the far - infrared ( fir ) luminous population .",
    "this has led to the claim that different star - formation laws should apply for starbursts and quiescent disk galaxies ( e.g. daddi et al .",
    "2010b ; genzel et al .",
    "2010 ; sargent et al .",
    "part of this may be due to the different co - to - h@xmath15 conversion factors adopted to estimate their cold molecular gas masses ( e.g. ivison et al .",
    "2011 ; riechers et al .  2011 ; bolatto et al .",
    "2013 ) .    to assess the gas properties of high - redshift galaxies ,",
    "a `` blind '' survey is required .",
    "past selection of ir luminous galaxies for follow - up co line studies may have lead to a bias against cold , gas - rich systems .",
    "this selection effect may be overcome by conducting large volume surveys sensitive to co line emission .",
    "the current generation of broad bandwidth mm and cm - wavelength facilities such as the the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) , the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) and the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) now enable the possibility of conducting such surveys for molecular co line emission over significant cosmological volumes .",
    "indeed , the first wide bandwidth survey of a 0.5 arcmin@xmath8 region in the _ hubble _ deep field north across the 3 mm band with the pdbi has revealed high-_j _ co line emission in a few gas - rich galaxies ( walter et al .  2012 , 2014 ; decarli et al .  2014 ) .",
    "these higher frequency surveys may be biased against the cold molecular gas traced by the lower-_j _ transitions of co line emission that are accessible using the full 8  ghz of bandwidth now available with the vla .",
    "narrower bandwidth vla and pdbi surveys toward galaxy overdensities ( i.e. biased regions ) at @xmath16 have detected co line emission in gas - rich star - forming galaxies and agn ( aravena et al .",

    "we present a `` blind '' vla detection of co  _ _ j__=1 - 0 line emission in a star - forming galaxy at @xmath17 in the cosmos field .",
    "this is the first line emitter discovered in the co luminosity density at high redshift ( z ) [ coldz ] survey , a large survey programme ( riechers et al .   _ in prep . _ ) aimed at providing an unbiased view of the evolution of molecular gas using the ground - state co  _ _ j__=1 - 0 line , which is free from additional mass estimate uncertainties due to gas excitation , and the best tracer of the full size and mass of the gas reservoirs . in ",
    "2 we describe the observations and data analysis , in  3 we present our analysis and results .",
    "we discuss our findings in  4 and conclude in  5 . throughout this work",
    ", we adopt a concordance @xmath18cdm cosmology throughout , with @xmath19 = 71  km  @xmath20 , @xmath21 = 0.27 , and @xmath22 = 0.73 ( e.g. spergel et al .",
    "ka - band observations of a @xmath26.5 square arcminutes region of the cosmos extragalactic deep field ( scoville et al 2007a ) were made with the vla in its d - configuration during the spring of 2013 ( 13a-398 , pi : riechers ) .",
    "this survey utilizes the full 8 ghz of bandwidth afforded by the vla from 31-to-39 ghz , to simultaneously cover the peak epoch of galaxy assembly at @xmath23 ( in co  _ _ j__=10 ; @xmath2 3 gyr after the big bang ) and @xmath24 ( in co  _ _ j__=21 ; @xmath2 1 gyr after the big bang ) , soon after the end of cosmic reionization .",
    "the full details of the survey design and data processing , along with an analysis of the complete spectral line and continuum data , will be presented in subsequent papers . here , we show a prominent example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the molecular emission line search technique for obtaining blind detections of co line emission in high - redshift galaxies at long mm - wavelengths .    observations were made using three frequency tunings of the vla offset by 12 mhz , in order to account for the drops in sensitivity between each 128  mhz spectral window ( spw ) .",
    "j1041 + 0610 ( s@xmath25 @xmath26 jy ) was observed as the phase calibrator , while 3c286 was observed to calibrate the spectral bandpass and flux density scale .",
    "calibration for each pointing and frequency setting was performed separately using a vla data reduction pipeline developed using casa by nrao , with 6 second time averaging performed prior to the analysis .",
    "we flag one 2  mhz wide channel at the upper and lower end of each spw so that combined with our frequency dithering strategy , we obtain nearly uniform sensitivity across the @xmath28  ghz of spectral bandwidth .",
    "we also flag 30  mhz of spectrum between 31.48 and 31.51  ghz which is affected by strong radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "we used natural weighting in the imaging and no cleaning was performed . to generate the continuum image ,",
    "multi - frequency synthesis imaging was used and the resulting synthesized beamsize was @xmath27 .",
    "seven pointing mosaics of both the continuum and spectral line images were made for the full 8  ghz of total bandwidth between 31 and 39  ghz .",
    "the final rms in the spectral line data cube is @xmath2140  @xmath28jy per 2  mhz channel and the mean of the synthesized beamsize ( which varies over the band by @xmath225% ) is @xmath29 .    in order to search for spectral line emitters in the cosmos image cube ,",
    "we apply a bayesian source identification technique described further in @xcite , to identify possible candidates .",
    "the cosmos survey is a mosaic of several pointings , for which the level of noise changes as a function of position in the map , and this needs to be accounted for in order to assess the significance of a candidate . to calculate the noise at any given position we use the sensitivity map for each channel , normalised to a peak of 1 ,",
    "calculate the rms at the center of each channel in the mosaiced image , and then scale that value according to the sensitivity map . applying our line detection method to the vla data , we detect with high significance a previously unknown line emitter at @xmath3010@xmath3100@xmath3218.21@xmath33 , @xmath3402@xmath3534@xmath3256.7@xmath33 ( j2000 ) , with an emission line frequency of 33.142  ghz and an integrated intensity of @xmath36  jy  km  s@xmath4 ( figures [ figure : cont]-[figure:5chan ] ) .",
