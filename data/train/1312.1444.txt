    "energy transfer ( wet ) has attracted significant interests recently for delivering energy to electrical devices over the air .",
    "generally , wet can be implemented by inductive coupling via magnetic field induction , magnetic resonant coupling based on the principle of resonant coupling , or electromagnetic ( em ) radiation .",
    "the different types of wet techniques in practice have their respective advantages and disadvantages ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "for example , inductive coupling and magnetic resonant coupling both have high energy transfer efficiency for short - range ( e.g. , several centimeters ) and mid - range ( say , a couple of meters ) applications , respectively ; however , it is difficult to apply them to charge freely located devices simultaneously .",
    "in contrast , em radiation based far - field wet , particularly over the radio frequency ( rf ) bands , is applicable for much longer range ( up to tens of meters ) applications and also capable of charging multiple devices even when they are moving by exploiting the broadcast nature of rf signal propagation ; whereas its energy transfer efficiency may fall rapidly over distance .",
    "rf signal enabled wet is anticipated to have abundant applications in providing cost - effective and perpetual energy supplies to energy - constrained wireless networks such as sensor networks in future .",
    "in fact , applying rf - based wet in various types of wireless communication networks has been extensively studied in the literature recently . in general",
    ", there are two main lines of research that have been pursued , namely simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) and wireless powered communications ( wpc ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where the information transmission in the network is in the same or opposite direction of the wet , respectively .    for both swipt and wpc ,",
    "how to optimize the energy transfer efficiency from the energy transmitter ( et ) to one or more energy receivers ( ers ) by combating the severe signal power loss over distance is a challenging problem . to efficiently solve this problem , multi - antenna or multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques , which have been successfully applied in wireless communication systems to improve the information transmission rate and reliability over wireless channels ,",
    "were also proposed for wet @xcite .",
    "specifically , deploying multiple antennas at the et enables focusing the transmitted energy to destined ers via beamforming , while equipping multiple antennas at each er increases the effective aperture area , both leading to improved end - to - end energy transfer efficiency . for the point - to - point mimo wet system , it has been shown in @xcite that energy beamforming is optimal to maximize the energy transfer efficiency by transmitting with only one single energy beam at the et , which is in sharp contrast to the celebrated spatial multiplexing technique used in the point - to - point mimo communication system which applies multiple beams to maximize the information transmission rate @xcite .",
    "= 1     in practical systems , the benefit of energy beamforming in mimo wet crucially relies on the availability of the channel state information ( csi ) at the et .",
    "however , acquiring such csi is particularly challenging in wet systems , since existing methods for channel learning in wireless communication ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) may be no longer applicable .",
    "for example , one well - known solution to acquire the csi at the transmitter in conventional wireless communication is by estimating the reverse link channel based on the training signals sent by the receiver .",
    "however , this method only applies to systems operating in time - division duplex ( tdd ) and critically depends on the accuracy of the assumption made on the reciprocity between the forward and reverse link channels .",
    "furthermore , applying this method to wet systems requires a more careful design of energy - efficient training signals at the er , since they consume part of the er s energy that is harvested from the et .",
    "alternatively , another commonly adopted solution to obtain csi at the transmitter in wireless communication is by sending training signals from the transmitter to the receiver , through which the receiver can estimate the channel and then send the estimated channel back to the transmitter via a feedback channel .",
    "this method applies to both tdd and frequency - division duplex ( fdd ) based systems ; however , it requires complex baseband signal processing at the receiver for channel estimation and feedback , which may not be implementable at the er in wet system due to its practical hardware limitation . shows a commonly used er design for wet @xcite , in which each receive antenna ( also known as rectenna ) first converts the received rf signal to a direct current ( dc ) signal via a rectifier , and then the dc signals from all receive antennas are combined to charge a battery .",
    "evidently , it is difficult in this er design to incorporate baseband signal processing for channel estimation . ] to overcome the above drawbacks of existing methods , it is desirable to investigate new channel learning and feedback schemes for mimo wet systems by taking into account the hardware limitation at each er , which motivates this work .    in this paper , we consider a multiuser mimo system for wet as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , where one et with @xmath0 transmit antennas broadcasts wireless energy to a group of @xmath1 ers each with @xmath2 receive antennas via transmit energy beamforming over a given frequency band .",
    "we assume that the ers can send their feedback information to the et perfectly over orthogonal feedback channels ( by e.g. piggybacking the feedback information with their uplink data in a wireless powered sensor network @xcite ) .",
    "under this system setup , we propose a two - phase transmission protocol for channel learning and energy transmission , respectively . in the channel learning phase",
    ", the et aims to learn the mimo channels to different ers by adjusting the training signals according to the individual feedback information from each er . based on the estimated channels , in the energy transmission phase , the et then designs optimal transmit energy beamforming to maximize the weighted sum - power transferred to all ers .",
    "in particular , we propose a new channel learning algorithm that requires only one feedback bit from each er per feedback interval .",
    "specifically , each feedback bit indicates the increase or decrease of the harvested energy at each er in the present versus the previous intervals , which can be practically measured at each er without changing the existing energy harvesting circuits as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ( by e.g. connecting an `` energy meter '' at the sum output of the dc signals from different receive antennas ) . based on such feedback information",
    ", the et adjusts its transmitted training signals in subsequent feedback intervals during the channel learning phase and at the same time obtains improved estimates of the mimo channels to different ers .",
    "it is worth noting that there have been several alternative schemes reported in the literature for one - bit feedback based channel learning , e.g. , _",
    "cyclic jacobi technique ( cjt ) _",
    "@xcite , _ gradient sign _ @xcite , and _ distributed beamforming _",
    "@xcite , which have been proposed and studied in different application scenarios .",
    "specifically , the cjt algorithm was proposed for the secondary transmitter ( st ) to learn its interference channel to the primary receiver ( pr ) in a mimo cognitive radio system @xcite , in which the st adjusts its transmitted signals over consecutive time slots based on the one - bit information indicating the increase or decrease of its resulted interference power at the pr , which is extracted from the feedback signals of the pr .",
    "the gradient sign algorithm was proposed to estimate the dominant eigenmode of a point - to - point mimo channel @xcite , in which the transmitter obtains a one - bit feedback from the receiver per time slot , which indicates the increase or decrease of the signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) at the receiver over two consecutive slots .",
    "the distributed beamforming algorithm was proposed to learn the channel phases in a system consisting of multiple distributed single - antenna transmitters simultaneously sending a common message to a single - antenna receiver @xcite , where each transmitter updates its own signal phase in a distributed manner by using the one - bit feedback from the receiver indicating whether the current snr is larger or smaller than its recorded highest snr so far .",
    "notice that the above three algorithms can all be applied to one - bit feedback based channel learning in the mimo wet system of our interest ; however , these methods have the common limitation that they can only be used to learn the eigenvectors or the dominant eigenmode of a single - user mimo channel matrix at each time , instead of learning multiple users mimo channels exactly at the same time . as a result",
    ", they may not achieve the optimal energy transfer efficiency in the multiuser mimo wet system based on one - bit feedback .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new approach to design the one - bit feedback based mimo channel learning for wet by applying the celebrated analytic center cutting plane method ( accpm ) in convex optimization @xcite . to the authors best knowledge",
    ", this paper is the first attempt to apply the accpm approach for the design of channel learning with one - bit feedback . for our proposed accpm based channel learning algorithm",
    ", we first provide an analysis for its worst - case convergence .",
    "it is shown that the accpm based channel learning can obtain the estimates of all @xmath1 mimo channels each with arbitrary number of receive antennas , @xmath3 , in at most @xmath4 number of feedback intervals with @xmath5 denoting a desired accuracy , and @xmath6 representing the ceiling function of real numbers . from this result , it is further inferred that when @xmath7 , the proposed algorithm has the same analytic convergence performance regardless of the number of ers , @xmath1 , which shows its benefit of simultaneously learning multiuser mimo channels . finally , we compare the performance of our proposed channel learning algorithm against the aforementioned three benchmark algorithms in terms of both convergence speed and energy transfer efficiency .",
    "it is shown through extensive simulations that our proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence for channel learning as well as higher energy transfer efficiency than the other three algorithms ; while the performance gain of our proposed algorithm becomes more significant as the number of ers in the wet system increases .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "denote @xmath49 as the mimo channel matrix from the et to er @xmath48 , and @xmath50 .",
    "then by letting @xmath51 denote the frobenius norm of the matrix @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath53 , we obtain the normalized channel matrix from the et to er @xmath48 as @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 ) with @xmath56 .",

    "[ fig : system ] ) ; instead , it can measure its average harvested power over a certain period of time by simply connecting an `` energy meter '' at the combined dc signal output shown in fig . [",
    "fig : system ] .",
    "we aim to design the energy beams at the et to maximize the weighted sum - energy transferred to @xmath1 ers , i.e. , @xmath63 with @xmath64 given in ( [ eqn:1 ] ) , over each transmission block subject to a given transmit sum - power constraint , where @xmath65 denotes the energy weight for er @xmath66 with @xmath67 . in order to ensure certain fairness among different ers for wet ,",
    "it is desirable to assign higher energy weights to the ers more far apart from the et .",

    "we explain these two phases of each transmission block in more detail as follows .",
    "the channel learning phase corresponds to the first @xmath84 amount of time in each block of duration @xmath34 , which is further divided into @xmath85 feedback intervals each of length @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 . for convenience , we assume that @xmath88 is an integer denoting the total block length in number of feedback intervals . during this phase",
    ", the et transmits different training signals ( each specified by a corresponding transmit covariance matrix ) over @xmath85 feedback intervals .",
    "let the transmit covariance at the et in interval @xmath89 be denoted by @xmath90 .",
    "then the transferred energy to the @xmath48th er over the @xmath91th interval is given by @xmath92 .",
    "in the meanwhile , er @xmath48 measures its harvested energy amount @xmath93 and based on it feeds back one bit at the end of the @xmath91th interval , denoted by @xmath94 , to indicate whether the harvested energy in the @xmath91th interval is larger ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) or smaller ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) than that in the @xmath97th interval , @xmath98 . for the convenience of our analysis",
    "later , we set @xmath99 such that @xmath100 . more specifically , if @xmath101 , then @xmath102 ; while if @xmath103 , then @xmath96 . we also denote @xmath104 and equivalently @xmath105 for convenience .",
    "notice that the feedback interval @xmath86 should be designed considering the practical feedback link rate from each er to the et as well as the sensitivity of the energy meter at each er . for the purpose of exposition , we assume in this paper that @xmath93 s are all perfectly measured at corresponding ers , and thus @xmath106 s are all accurately determined at the ers and then sent back to the et without any error.s at the ers due to the rectifier noise and feedback errors in the received @xmath106 s at the et due to the imperfect reverse links from the ers , both of which result in inaccurate @xmath106 s at the et . it is thus interesting to investigate their effects on the performance of our proposed channel learning algorithm with one - bit feedback , which , however , are beyond the scope of this paper . ]",
    "furthermore , we assume that the consumed energy for sending the one - bit feedback @xmath106 s is negligible at each er as compared to its average harvested energy . at the end of the channel learning phase , by using the collected feedback bits @xmath107 from all ers , the et can obtain an estimate of the normalized mimo channel @xmath108 for each er @xmath48 , which is denoted by @xmath109 , @xmath66 .",
    "the details of training signal design and channel estimation at the et based on the one - bit feedback information from one or more ers will be given later in sections [ sec : one - bit ] and [ sec : one - bit : multi ] .",

    "given the estimated @xmath109 s from the channel learning phase , we can obtain the estimate of @xmath77 as @xmath111 , and accordingly have the estimate of its dominant eigenvector @xmath76 as @xmath112 . then based on the principle of oeb , the et sets the ( rank - one ) transmit covariance in the energy transmission phase as @xmath113 .",
    "accordingly , the weighted sum - energy transferred to all ers during this phase is expressed as @xmath114 .    combining the above two phases ,",
    "the total weighted sum - energy transferred to all the @xmath1 ers over one particular block is given by @xmath115 in ( [ eqn : qpro ] ) , we observe that if the estimated mimo channel @xmath109 s are all accurate with a given finite @xmath85 ( or @xmath84 ) , then it follows that @xmath116 . in this case",

    "in this section , we consider the point - to - point or single - user mimo wet system with @xmath123 er . for notational convenience ,",
    "we remove the user subscript @xmath48 in this case , and thus denote the harvested energy amount and the feedback bit at each interval @xmath91 as @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively , @xmath89 . furthermore , since there is only one er in the system , we denote its channel power gain as @xmath126 , and its normalized channel matrix to be estimated as @xmath127 .",
    "we aim to propose a new channel learning algorithm for the et to estimate the single - user mimo channel @xmath77 based on the one - bit feedbacks from the er over training intervals in the channel learning phase .",
    "the proposed algorithm is based on the celebrated accpm in convex optimization @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we first introduce accpm , then present the accpm based channel learning algorithm with one - bit feedback , and finally provide its convergence analysis .",
    "accpm is an efficient localization and cutting plane method for solving general convex or quasi - convex optimization problems @xcite , with the goal of finding one feasible point in a convex target set @xmath128 , where @xmath129 can be the set of optimal solutions to the optimization problem .",

    "the first argument is true since it follows from ( [ eqn:13 ] ) that the dominant eigenvalue of @xmath168 is always no smaller than @xmath421 , while the second fact can be easily verified by deriving the first - order derivative of the function in the right - hand side in ( [ eqn : convergence ] ) . as a result ,",

    ", the et learns one of the @xmath1 mimo channels by applying one from the three channel learning algorithms . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the implementation details of the three algorithms , respectively .",
    "for each algorithm , we first introduce the channel training and estimation method during each slot of the channel learning phase assuming the same ( or slightly modified ) one - bit feedback scheme at each er as in our proposed channel learning algorithm , and then explain the energy beamforming design for the energy transmission phase .",
    "first , consider the @xmath48th channel learning slot for estimating the channel from the et to the @xmath48th er , @xmath442 . during this slot ,",
    "the et updates @xmath443 s based on the feedback bit @xmath106 s to implement cjt for blindly obtaining the evd for @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath444 ; accordingly , the et can obtain an estimate of @xmath445 at the end of slot @xmath48 , denoted by @xmath446 .",
    "the idea of cjt is based on the fact that the evd of @xmath108 can be implemented through a series of two - dimensional rotations , where at each rotation one pair of the matrix s two off - diagonal elements are eliminated .",
    "specifically , let @xmath447 denote the rotation index , and define @xmath448 .",
    "then at each rotation @xmath199 , the cjt aims to find an @xmath254 unitary rotation matrix @xmath449 to construct a new matrix @xmath450 , such that the @xmath451th and @xmath452th entries of @xmath453 are both zero , where @xmath454 and @xmath455 .",
    "note that for the @xmath456 hermitian matrix @xmath108 , there are @xmath457 pairs of @xmath458 satisfying @xmath459 and @xmath460 ; hence , in each set of @xmath457 rotations , the cjt will choose @xmath451 such that each pair of @xmath458 is selected once only .",
    "we refer to such a set of @xmath457 rotations as one sweep . after each complete sweep ,",
    "the et can obtain an improved estimate of @xmath445 .",
    "to successfully implement cjt based on the one - bit feedback , it is key to estimate @xmath449 at each rotation @xmath199 .",
    "this is done by calculating two real variables via two binary line searches , where each line search is accomplished with several feedback intervals required by utilizing the feedback bit @xmath106 s ( see more details in @xcite ) .",
    "next , with the estimated @xmath446 s for all the @xmath1 ers after the completion of the channel learning phase , we consider the energy beamforming design for the energy transmission phase . since the et can only obtain the estimates of @xmath461 but not those of @xmath462 ,",
    "it is difficult to reconstruct the estimate of @xmath463 for implementing the oeb . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we propose a suboptimal energy beamforming design for wet .",
    "specifically , we define @xmath464 , where @xmath465 denotes the estimate of the dominant eigenvector of @xmath108 ( i.e. , @xmath466 ) , which can be obtained based on the estimated @xmath467",
    ". then the et uses the dominant eigenvector of @xmath468 as the energy beamforming vector @xmath112 during the energy transmission phase , i.e. , @xmath113 .",
    "it is worth noting that although this energy beamforming design is suboptimal in general , it is optimal when @xmath123 or @xmath469 , since in this case the estimated energy beamforming vector will approach to the oeb with perfect csi at the et as @xmath470 .",
    "it should be pointed out that in the cjt algorithm , the performance of channel learning is controlled by the number of sweeps implemented as well as the desired accuracy of each line search , given by @xmath471 .",
    "if @xmath349 is set small and the number of sweeps is chosen to be large , the estimation of @xmath445 can be made more accurate , but at the cost of more feedback intervals required .",
    "first , consider the @xmath48th slot in the channel learning phase , @xmath442 , for which the feedback intervals are indexed by 1 to @xmath441 for convenience . during this slot",
    ", the et sends only one energy beam per feedback interval denoted by @xmath472 ( i.e. , @xmath473 is of rank - one ) , @xmath474 . by adjusting @xmath472 s over different feedback intervals in slot @xmath48 ,",
    "the et can obtain an estimate of the dominant eigenvector of @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath475 , denoted by @xmath465 , for er @xmath48 .    the gradient sign algorithm during each slot @xmath48 is explained as follows by assuming @xmath441 to be an even integer for convenience . define a sequence of reference beamforming vectors for this slot as @xmath476 with @xmath477 , where @xmath478 denotes the initial reference beamforming vector .",
    "then , over each odd interval @xmath479 , the et sets the energy beam @xmath480 by adding a random perturbation vector to @xmath481 , while over the next even interval @xmath482 , the et sets @xmath483 by subtracting the same random perturbation to @xmath481 .",
    "based on the feedback @xmath484 from er @xmath48 at the end of interval @xmath482 , the et can know whether @xmath480 or @xmath483 achieves a higher transferred energy to er @xmath48 , and accordingly , it updates the reference beamforming vector @xmath485 as the better one . by performing the above procedure",
    ", it is shown in @xcite that as @xmath486 the reference beamforming vector @xmath487 will approach the direction of the dominant eigenvector @xmath475 .",
    "therefore , we can obtain an estimate of @xmath475 as @xmath465 over finite number of feedback intervals in slot @xmath48 .",
    "next , consider the energy transmission phase .",
    "similar to the case of cjt algorithm , since the et can only obtain the estimates of @xmath466 s instead of @xmath108 s , the et applies the dominant eigenvector of @xmath488 as the energy beamforming vector @xmath112 for wet .",
    "note that in the gradient sign algorithm , the performance of channel learning is affected by the norm of the added / subtracted random perturbation vector , which is referred to as the step size @xmath489 .",
    "in general , larger value of @xmath489 corresponds to faster convergence of the algorithm but also results in more estimation errors .",
