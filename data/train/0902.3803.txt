    "multiferroic manganites of the type @xmath14mno@xmath15 ( @xmath14=rare - earth ) have attracted a great deal of attention due to two main reasons : first , on the technological front multiferroics are promising materials for potential spintronic applications such as four - state memory devices @xcite . for their application , however , a better understanding of their fundamental properties is necessary .",
    "second , these materials belong to a class of complex oxides with various coupled ordering phenomena and rich phase diagrams @xcite .",
    "generally , @xmath14mno@xmath15 crystallizes in an orthorhombic , perovskite - like structure ( space group @xmath16 ) , if the rare - earth ionic radius is large enough , i.e.  @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "thus , the manganites with @xmath14 = la , pr , nd etc .",
    "are orthorhombic , whereas the @xmath14mno@xmath15 manganites for @xmath14 = y , tm , yb , lu , er with an ionic radius smaller than that of dy usually crystallize in hexagonal structure ( space group @xmath18 ) .",
    "since the transition between hexagonal and orthorhombic crystal structure of @xmath14mno@xmath15 occurs in the rare - earth series for the ionic radius of dy or ho , @xmath14mno@xmath15 with @xmath19 can be synthesized in both structures by applying different growth conditions @xcite .",
    "multiferroic @xmath14mno@xmath15 compounds are simultaneously ferroelectric and magnetic . both hexagonal as well as orthorhombic @xmath14mno@xmath15 exhibit multiferroic properties but",
    "the origin of the spontaneous polarisation is different in these two symmetries . in the hexagonal system ,",
    "the structural distortion arising from an asymmetric coordination of oxygen around @xmath14 leads to a net polarisation , as exemplified in the case of ymno@xmath15 @xcite , and the ferroelectric transition temperatures are as high as @xmath20  700  k. hexagonal exhibits two kinds of magnetic phase transitions : ( i ) an antiferromagnetic ordering of the mn - sublattice below a nel temperature @xmath21  100  k , and ( ii ) a low temperature ordering of the @xmath14 moments usually below 10  k @xcite .",
    "the ferroelectric order persists down to low temperatures through these magnetic transitions @xcite , and a coupling between antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric domains has been observed by optical second harmonic generation ( shg ) @xcite . the crystal structure of _",
    "h-_@xmath14mno@xmath15 essentially consists of corner - sharing mno@xmath22 bipyramids separated by layers of @xmath23 .",
    "the mn ions within the @xmath24 plane of the hexagonal structure occupy a stacked triangular lattice giving rise to an antiferromagnetic mn - o - mn ( super-)exchange coupling between nearest mn - neighbours @xcite .",
    "below 100  k a three - dimensional ordering of the mn spins results in an antiferromagnetic phase in _ h-_@xmath14mno@xmath15 @xcite . this antiferromagnetic transition has been observed in magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of _ h-_@xmath14mno@xmath15 systems like scmno@xmath15 , lumno@xmath15 and ymno@xmath15 @xcite . at the nel temperature ,",
    "a non - collinear 120@xmath25 antiferromagnetic spin structure is established owing to the geometrical frustration of the triangular lattice planes .",
    "the coupling of these triangular lattices of mn - layers along the @xmath26 axis is difficult to resolve from macroscopic measurements but it has been investigated for various hexagonal manganites , e.g. , by neutron diffraction and shg methods @xcite . the responsible and much weaker mn - o - o - mn super - superexchange couplings may be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on the particular rare - earth through changes of the lattice parameters @xcite . in the much - studied compound _",
    "h-_homno@xmath15 from this class of materials , an antiferromagnetic coupling has been proposed from neutron diffraction @xcite .",
    "generally , the @xmath27 moments of @xmath23 in _ h-_@xmath14mno@xmath15 may order at very low temperature .",
    "the interaction of the magnetic sublattices of _ h-_@xmath14mno@xmath0 poses interesting problems due to the frustration in the mn sublattice which carries over to the coupling of @xmath14-moments within their @xmath14 sublattice @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the rare - earth ions occupy two inequivalent crystallographic positions ",
    "the 2(a ) and 4(b ) sites denoted as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively  while the mn ions occupy the 6(c ) position .",
    "hence , the rare - earth magnetism in _ h-_@xmath14mno@xmath15 may display multi - sublattice effects , and the ordering of the rare - earth moments in the two different crystallographic sites 4(b ) and 2(a ) is found to be different for different rare - earths .",
    "moreover , the magnetic moments on these two sites can be considered to be independent and do not have to be of the same size @xcite . for different rare - earth ion ,",
    "the geometric arrangement of the sublattice remains the same , but the low temperature magnetic properties can be different depending on the anisotropy as well as the sign and relative strength of the 4@xmath7 - 4@xmath7 and 4@xmath7 - 3@xmath8 couplings . however , the rare - earth moments at the 4(b ) sites are usually ordered and directed perpendicular to the @xmath24 basal plane , i.e. , parallel to the @xmath26-axis .",
    "hence , the inter sublattice coupling may be frustrated too and may give rise to complex magnetic phase diagrams .",
    "in _ h-_homno@xmath0 the mn spins order at @xmath4 @xmath30 72  k @xcite and , at temperatures below this transition , this compound displays a complex magnetic phase diagram ( as studied recently by lorenz _ et  al . _",
    "the lattice anomalies introduced by the magnetoelastic interactions of the novel magnetic phases in homno@xmath15 are also reflected in dielectric measurements as anomalies @xcite .",
    "the fact that the magnetic structure of this class of @xmath14mno@xmath15 is complex and poorly understood is reinstated by the ongoing attempts to determine the magnetic structure and the magnetic phase diagram including an intricate succession of field - induced phases in homno@xmath15 @xcite . in comparison , relatively little is known about the magnetism of _",

    "the ferroelectricity is attributed to a complex spiral spin - order that breaks the inversion symmetry @xcite .",
    "the associated magnetically driven transitions usually occur at much lower temperatures .",
    "_ o-_dymno@xmath15 has been investigated in some detail mainly by diffraction methods , and hence , detailed microscopic information on the spin - structure is available @xcite .",
    "an incommensurate ordering of mn moments sets in at @xmath31  39  k. the collinear magnetic order is of a longitudinal sinusoidal spin - density - wave type with moments along the @xmath32-axis in the @xmath33 space group setting and a propagation vector @xmath34 that varies with temperature below @xmath4 @xcite . at @xmath35",
    "18  k , an additional component of the mn moment along the @xmath26 axis gives rise to a spiral ( cycloidal ) magnetic order and breaks the inversion symmetry @xcite .",
    "at this temperature , spontaneous electric polarization is observed along the @xmath26 axis .",
    "this electric polarization undergoes a flop transition from the @xmath26 to the @xmath36 axis when a magnetic field is applied within the @xmath24 plane . below @xmath6 = 5  k , the dy moments order in a commensurate structure with propagation vector along @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "strong structural distortions related to the ordering of mn and dy magnetic moments and couplings between these moments have been observed by synchrotron x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and resonant magnetic scattering experiments @xcite .    here , we report magnetic susceptibility , magnetisation and specific heat measurements on both _ h-_dymno@xmath15 and _ o-_dymno@xmath15 single crystals .",
    "different crystal growth atmospheres have been used to stabilize the system in one of these two crystal structures .",
    "the macroscopic measurements of magnetic properties and specific heat broadly agree with the microscopic information on the spin structure and magnetic phase transitions in the dymno@xmath0 system .",
    "the results in particular show that the dy magnetic moments at low temperatures are only partially ordered in the case of _",
    "h-_dymno@xmath0 , whereas they are completely ordered in the case of the _ o-_dymno@xmath0 .",
    "single crystals of dymno@xmath15 were grown by the optical floating - zone method in an infrared furnace ( fz - t-10000-h - vi - vp procured from crystal systems inc . ) .",
    "the furnace is equipped with four hemi - ellipsoidal mirrors and halogen lamps that are capable of delivering a total power of 6 kw .",
    "the starting materials for growth were prepared following the standard route of solid state reaction .",
    "the precursors dy@xmath37o@xmath15 and mno@xmath37 were mixed intimately and subsequently heat treated at 1200@xmath38c for 12  h. then , the material was reground and annealed again at 1250@xmath38c for 24  h. this process was repeated until a single phase was obtained .",
    "x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was performed to confirm phase purity .",
    "the powder was used to fabricate ceramic ingots for crystal growth by filling it into rubber tubes and subjecting them to a hydrostatic pressure of 70  mpa .",
    "these cylindrical ingots were sintered at 1450@xmath38c for 12  h prior to growth . during the growth",
    "the seed and feed rods were rotated at 40  rpm in opposite directions . at a growth rate of 4 - 6  mm / h crystals of typical dimensions 5  cm length and 4  mm - 6  mm diameter were obtained .",
    "growth was performed in the ambiance of either argon or air , to obtain either hexagonal or orthorhombic crystals , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the gibb s free energy of the two polymorphic modifications of dymno@xmath0 are close @xcite and though the perovskite phase is stable at room temperature , a transformation to a hexagonal phase is possible at temperatures greater than 1600@xmath39c @xcite .",
    "it is documented that the synthesis in oxygen leads to the formation of a perovskite phase whereas oxygen deficit leads to the hexagonal phase @xcite . in an oxygen - deficient atmosphere",
    "the crystal will be unable to complete the twelve - fold coordination of @xmath14 required for the perovskite ; instead an eight - fold coordination with hexagonal symmetry results .",
    "laue photographs of the grown crystals indicated their single crystalline nature .",
    "chemical composition of these crystals was determined by energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( edax ) as well as by inductively coupled atomic emission spectroscopy ( icpaes ) using a perkin elmer spectrometer optima 2000 .",

    "as - grown crystals of both _ h , o-_dymno@xmath0 were black and lustreless . the xrd data for _ h-_dymno@xmath0 and results of the rietveld analysis are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the crystal structure has been refined in a hexagonal space group @xmath43 .",

    "the field cooled ( fc ) as well as zero field cooled ( zfc ) magnetisation curves at a field of 10  oe applied along the @xmath26 axis presented in figure 3(a ) show bifurcation at about 3  k. similar data obtained for field applied perpendicular to the @xmath26 axis are shown in the inset of figure 3(a ) .",

    "it is interesting to note that the antiferromagnetic transition of mn at @xmath4  =  57  k , ( determined from specific heat measurements ) is not discernible in the magnetisation profile of _ h-_dymno@xmath0 . at temperatures above @xmath4",
    ", the inverse susceptibility 1/@xmath46 follows a curie - weiss behaviour , yielding an effective magnetic moment value @xmath47  10.81  @xmath48(figure 4(b ) ) .",
    "this moment is close to the expected value @xmath49 = @xmath50(mn)@xmath51(dy)@xmath52^{1/2}=11.67~\\mu_b$ ] .",

    "the values of @xmath55 and @xmath54 agree well with those ( 10.7@xmath48 and @xmath5617  k ) obtained for similar _ h-_homno@xmath15 crystals @xcite .",
    "however , as the magnetic response in the paramagnetic regime is strongly influenced by excitations of the 4@xmath7-electrons of dy split by the crystalline electric field ( cef ) , the parameters from the curie - weiss fit do not directly relate to the physics of the coupled magnetic sublattices as in other hexagonal @xmath14mno@xmath15 systems @xcite .",
    "the isothermal magnetisation curves at 2 , 10 and 60  k measured along the @xmath26 axis and within the @xmath24 plane are presented in figure 4(a ) . for @xmath57  10",
    "k the magnetisation and initial susceptibility for fields applied in the @xmath24 plane is larger than those measured along the @xmath26 axis .",
    "this is consistent with ( i ) the easy - plane character of the non - collinear magnetic order in the triangular mn - sublattice , ( ii ) the easy - axis anisotropy introduced by the dy - ions along the @xmath26-axis . the data for 10  k and 60  k do not show any remanent magnetisation , thus spontaneous or weak ferromagnetic moments are absent at these temperatures .",
    "the overall magnetisation increase for this temperature range is probably dominated by a large linear contribution from the paramagnetic dy moments . at 2  k ,",
    "a ferromagnetic - like hysteretic behaviour is found in the low - field part of the magnetisation curve ( figure 4 ( b ) ) and the initial susceptibility is stronger along the @xmath26 axis than along the @xmath24 plane .",
    "the magnetic behavior at this low temperature must be attributed to the dy - magnetic order and is strongly anisotropic .",
    "the magnetisation curve along @xmath26 has the character of a ferromagnetic easy - axis system with technical saturation reached at about 600  oe . in order to estimate the zero - field magnetic",
    "moment we extrapolated the linear part of @xmath58 above 600 oe towards zero field and obtained @xmath59  7.5  emu / g  @xmath60  0.36  @xmath61 assuming that this spontaneous magnetisation is only due to a ferromagnetic contribution of the dy - moments on the 2(a ) sites , still the observed value for the ordered magnetic moment is very small , only about 0.1 times the full polarization on the 2(a)-sites .",
    "hence , it is likely that the dy - moments responsible for this effect are only partially polarized by a coupling to the mn - sublattice and/or the 4(b)-sublattice , e.g. by dipolar couplings .",
    "superimposed on this essentially ferromagnetic behaviour with a small saturation magnetisation is a linear overall increase at low fields 600  oe  @xmath62  20  koe and a tendency towards lower high  field susceptibility , although no saturation is attained even at 50  koe .",
    "correspondingly , the magnetisation curve along the @xmath24 plane resembles a hard - axis magnetisation process with an essentially linear increase of magnetisation .",
    "however , the small hysteresis seen in the @xmath24 magnetisation curve can not be explained by this process .",
    "the existence of the different , yet coupled sublattices of mn and dy , as mentioned above , underlies the high magnetic anisotropy and the complex magnetisation behavior in this crystal . a preliminary qualitative picture of the magnetic structure of _ h-_dymno@xmath0 based on the magnetic measurements is possible by a three sub - lattice model @xcite .",
    "this model assumes three different and largely decoupled magnetic sublattices in _",
    "h-_@xmath14mno@xmath15 : a lattice of mn ( at 6c ) that forms a 120@xmath63 spin arrangement in the @xmath64 plane , and two more lattices formed by the rare - earth ions @xmath28 and @xmath29 situated at 2(a ) and 4(b ) sites , respectively .",
    "a schematic of the arrangement is shown in figure 5 .",
    "as the temperature is reduced , at around 57  k , the interlayer coupling between the mn ions in the @xmath24 plane gives rise to a non - collinear af order , as found by specific heat data ( see below ) .",
    "however , the exchange field originating from the mn order below @xmath4 acts on the rare - earth lattice , and with further reduction in temperature , the @xmath28 and @xmath29 moments commence to order . in the case of dymno@xmath0 ,",
    "the dy@xmath1 moments order below @xmath6  =  3  k. at 2  k , a ferromagnetic feature is detected when measuring along @xmath26 axis whereas along the @xmath24 plane the ferromagnetic component is weak . in analogy to ermno@xmath15 @xcite this suggest that the rare - earth ions at @xmath28 could be paramagnetic down to low temperatures before they order ferromagnetically . on the other hand , the @xmath29 ions may order antiferromagnetically with their magnetic moments pointing along the hexagonal @xmath26 axis similar to the magnetic order observed in ybmno@xmath15 and tmmno@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "with further increase in magnetic field , at about 30  koe , the bending in the @xmath58 curves for both directions of applied fields signals a gradual saturation at 2 and 10 k. there is no clear explanation for this effect , however , it should be noted that a contribution of the mn - sublattice is likely , as a similar bending of @xmath58 curves has been observed for _",
    "h-_ymno@xmath15 with a non - magnetic @xmath14-site at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "recently , observations on thin films of _",
    "h-_dymno@xmath15 indicated that the competition and frustration inherent in the magnetic multi - sublattice of @xmath14mno@xmath15 may lead to a magnetic spin - glass state @xcite .",
    "however , from the _",
    "ac_-susceptibility of _ h-_dymno@xmath0 along @xmath26 and @xmath24 the transition of the mn lattice is not obvious and possibly being masked by the frustration in the mn lattice or by the strong dy paramagnetic susceptibility .",
    "it is clear that the competing inter- and intra - sublattice couplings are present in the hexagonal structure of @xmath14mno@xmath15 which can have pronounced effects at low temperatures .",
    "as expected , the real part of the susceptibility , @xmath65 , exhibits a peak close to 3  k which is evident in the @xmath66 curves of _",

    "10  khz measured along the @xmath26 axis as well as the @xmath24 plane , figure 6(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "this peak originates from the ordering of dy moments at low temperature .",
    "the peak temperature displays no significant dependence on frequency .",
    "this rules out the presence of slow dynamics as a characteristics of glassy magnetism .",

    "the antiferromagnetic signal is suppressed and the peak at 3  k diminishes in magnitude . above 30  koe , the peak vanishes corroborating a gradual field - driven transformation of the magnetic structure in this field range . when a magnetic field is applied along the @xmath24 plane ( figure 7(b ) )",
    ", one observes a shift in the peak to higher temperatures , in addition to a decrease in the magnitude of @xmath65 .",

    "the antiferromagnetic transition of the mn sublattice is evident as a sharp peak at about 57  k. thus , in _",
    "the magnetic ordering transition in the mn - sublattice appears only in specific heat , but is not detectable in the magnetic susceptibility data .",
    "this is in contrast to the properties of hexagonal homno@xmath15 , where @xmath68 is detected by peaks in @xmath67 and in @xmath69 as well @xcite .",

    ". the huge paramagnetic susceptibility stemming from dy and/or the frustrated mn lattice could be the reason for this transition not being visible in the magnetization and susceptibility curves .",
    "the rare - earth moment manifests itself through a partial antiferromagnetic order in the fc / zfc curves at 3  k. the mixed interactions and frustration in the magnetic lattice do not lead to a magnetic glassy state , as is inferred from the absence of any frequency dependence in @xmath65 . on application of a magnetic field the antiferromagnetic signal in @xmath65 at low temperature is suppressed .",
    "in addition to the transition in the mn sublattice the specific heat data exhibit a peak at even lower temperature resulting from the rare - earth magnetic ordering .",

    "these curves split at 39  k , exhibit a peak in the zfc magnetisation curve at 16  k , and a weak feature at 5  k the latter signalling the dy order .",

    "the specific heat curves corroborate these conclusions displaying peaks at temperatures corresponding to the sinusoidal ordering of mn moments into an incommensurate phase , the _ lock  in _ transition , and the ordering of the rare - earth moments .",
    "+ our detailed magnetisation measurements highlight the complex interplay of the 3@xmath8 and rare - earth magnetism in @xmath88- and @xmath89-dymno@xmath15 . in turn , investigating the effect of rare - earth magnetism of dy on the magnetic ordering and dielectric property of _ o-_dymno@xmath15 at low temperature is called for .",
