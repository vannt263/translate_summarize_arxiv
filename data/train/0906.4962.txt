    "no general pattern is however available and situations can be very varied . whence it seems appropriate to continue considering the questions through the methods used in the theory of turbulence @xcite - @xcite , low - dimensional dynamical systems @xcite - @xcite or theory of nonlinear waves @xcite - @xcite but _ exordium _ to go back to the classical verhulst ideas and lotka - volterra model by introducing some realistic conditions on the growth ratios and on the interaction coefficients between the populations @xcite - @xcite . indeed there is then a connexion to the problem of extinction of populations @xcite , religions @xcite , languages @xcite , and to the very modern question of internet governance in which the _ old _ stakeholders , i.e. the most powerful actors , and a variable set of _ new _ participants are somewhat abused or lacking cohesion in their reaction @xcite .",
    "interestingly this demands at some stage a consideration of the connexion between economical and social physics and social dynamics , including the analysis of time series @xcite - @xcite though with some caveat due to either size or debatable data value . whence the need for a theoretical approach and some modelization in order to focus any data gathering toward useful input in further work .      in sect .",
    "2 , we formulate a general / mathematical model in a finite system size , _ we emphasize , _ allowing for a changing population size . in a realistic way we consider people unaffected by the available ideologies as well as conversions to ideologies .",
    "two mechanisms are discussed by which the followers of an ideology can increase : _ unitary _ conversion ( a citizen is converted by means of forms of mass communication such as newspapers , radio or television channels ) and _ binary _ conversion ( a citizen is converted by interpersonal contacts with other citizens ) .    in sect .",
    "3 we study the case when only one ideology spreads among the population . the whole country population is found to evolve towards an equilibrium state . in this state",
    "some part of the people becomes followers of the ideology and the remaining ones are not followers of the ideology .",
    "the fraction of adepts depends on the intensity of the unitary and binary conversion as well as on the ability of the ideology to reduce the dissatisfaction among its followers . in sect .",
    "4 , the case of two ideologies is examined .",
    "the introduction of a second ideology leads to tensions between the ideologies as the number of followers drops in comparison to the case when each of the ideologies is alone in the country .",
    "the tension can be quantified on a scale that can be considered to be an index of ideological tensions in the society .    in sect . 5 , in the case of three ideologies ,",
    "we briefly show that a chaotic behavior is seen to occur among many other solutions .",
    "this seems close to intuition . in sect .",
    "6 , conclusions are outlined and connected for relevance sake to a usual observation that the coexistence of ideologies implies the existence of tensions between them .",
    "let us consider a set ( country ) with a population of @xmath0 agents .",
    "we are going to consider that the population is divided into @xmath1 factions : @xmath2 factions each with a different specific ideology , such that the number of members in the corresponding populations are @xmath3 , and a fraction @xmath4 of people which are not followers of any ideology at a given moment of time .",
    "then @xmath5 we assume that the overall population evolves according to the generalized verhulst law @xmath6 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 are parameters , describing the environment .",
    "the growth process is constantly disrupted by small extinction events , as in @xcite , monitored through @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the overall population growth rate ; @xmath10 can be positive or negative . in this paper",
    "we shall consider the case @xmath11 , i.e. we shall study the spreading and competition between ideologies in a country with a growing total population .",
    "@xmath12 is the maximum possible population of the country ( its so called carrying capacity ) . in every ideological population @xmath13 we have to account for the following processes : deaths , dissatisfaction , unitary conversion , and binary conversion .    1 .",
    "first , we expect a decrease of the number of followers of an ideology through death or dissatisfaction with the ideology , i.e. through a term @xmath14 , where @xmath15 . in general @xmath16 .",
    "unitary conversion : such a conversion from one ideology to another is made without direct contact between the followers of different ideologies .",
    "the conversion happens through the information environment of the population .",
    "elements of this environment for example are the newspapers , the radio stations , television channels , printed propaganda materials or mass events such as speeches during election campaigns .",
    "excluded are the direct interpersonal contacts which lead to the binary conversion described below . in order to model the unitary conversion we assume that the number of people converted from ideology @xmath17 to ideology @xmath13 is proportional to the number @xmath18 of the followers of the ideology @xmath17 .",
    "an @xmath19 coefficient characterizes the intensity with which this conversion occurs .",
    "the corresponding modeling term is @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 .",
    "in addition a term @xmath22 describes the unitary conversion toward ideology @xmath13 from the @xmath4 people who were not followers of any ideology at the corresponding moment of time . in general",
    "@xmath23 @xmath24 3 .",
    "binary conversion : @xmath25 . in general",
    "this term describes the conversion to the @xmath13-th ideology because of direct interaction between members of the @xmath17-th and @xmath26-th ideology .",
    "we assume that the intensity of the interpersonal contacts is proportional to the numbers @xmath18 and @xmath27 of the followers of the two ideologies .",
    "the coefficient characterizing the intensity of the binary conversion is @xmath28 .",
    "the larger is @xmath28 , the more people are converted to the @xmath13-th ideology . in general the binary conversion coefficients can be @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "of course @xmath31 : there is no self - conversion .",
    "the equation for the evolution of the followers of the ideology @xmath13 becomes @xmath32 in general we can have a co - evolution of the environment and the populations , i.e. @xmath33 , but this will not be discussed here .",
    "indeed in this paper we shall discuss the simplest version of the model namely the case in which all the coefficients are time and @xmath34 independent .",
    "then the model system becomes geared by @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37    two remarks are in order .    1 .",
    "notice that arbitrary values are not allowed for the coefficients of the model .",
    "they must have values such that @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 be nonnegative at each @xmath41 .",
    "2 .   let us consider the @xmath13-th population and the binary conversion characterized by the coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath42 where @xmath17 and @xmath26 are different from @xmath13 . one could at first think that @xmath43 and @xmath44 describe one and the same process in which the interaction between followers of the @xmath17-th and @xmath26-th ideology leads to a conversion of these to the @xmath13-th ideology .",
    "in general however one should not identify the two terms .",
    "in so doing in the general model we retain one additional degree of freedom , i.e. , that which allows to distinguish between the ideology that is of the initiator of the interaction and the ideology of someone who is apparently simply a participant in the interaction .",
    "below we shall consider the dynamics of populations of followers of the ideologies for the cases of presence of 1,2 or 3 ideologies in the country .",
    "in the case of spreading of one ideology the population of the country is divided into two groups : @xmath38 followers of the single ideology and @xmath4 people who are not followers of this ideology at the corresponding time .",
    "let us first discuss the case when only the unitary conversion scheme exists , as possibly moving the ideology - free population toward the single ideology , i.e. @xmath45 is finite . let the initial conditions be @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the solution of the model system is @xmath48 @xmath49 \\bigg\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the special function @xmath52 the condition @xmath53 is equivalent to @xmath54 .",
    "this means that the solution ( 7 ) describes the development in the case of a densely populated territory . for @xmath55",
    ", @xmath51 can tend to @xmath56 and we can only obtain a numerical solution of the model system of equations .",
    "the obtained solution describes an evolution in which the total population @xmath0 reaches asymptotically the carrying capacity @xmath57 of the environment .",
    "the number of adepts of the ideology reaches an equilibrium value which corresponds to the fixed point of the model equation for @xmath58 .",
    "this fixed point is @xmath59 the number of people which are not followers of the ideology asymptotically tends to @xmath60 . as a numerical example let @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then @xmath64 which means that the evolution of the system leads to an asymptotic state in which 60 % of the population are followers of the ideology and 40 % are not .",
    "now let not only unitary but also binary conversion processes be possible .",
    "the evolution in this case can not be investigated analytically .",
    "however the asymptotic behavior for @xmath38 can be obtained when the total population @xmath0 has reached the carrying capacity @xmath57 of the environment . for this asymptotic state",
    "the evolution of @xmath38 reads @xmath65 there exist two fixed points but only one of them satisfies the requirement @xmath66 .",
    "this fixed point is @xmath67 the equation ( [ single_full ] ) has an analytical solution .",
    "the solution depends on whether @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "the two cases can be realized respectively when @xmath70 and @xmath71 . if @xmath72 then @xmath73 where @xmath74 @xmath75 and where the characteristic time @xmath76 is here given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 .    for the case @xmath79",
    "@xmath80 where @xmath81 @xmath82     ( a ) : illustration of the inertial growth and its dependence on the parameter @xmath83 .",

    "there are three possibilities    1 .",
    "@xmath87 for all @xmath41 , i.e. the number of followers increases monotonically . for the particular case of only a unitary conversion process",
    "the condition reads @xmath88 2 .",
    "@xmath89 for all @xmath41 , i.e. the number of followers decreases monotonically .",
    "for the case of only unitary conversions , the condition reads @xmath90 3 .",
    "the most interesting case is when @xmath58 can change sign with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "the following effect can be observed : the number of followers of the ideology can increase despite the fact that @xmath91 .",
    "the reason for this effect is the increasing number @xmath4 , occurring because of the fast enough growth of the population of the country .",
    "when @xmath4 is small the term containing @xmath83 dominates and @xmath38 decreases .",
    "but in the course of time @xmath4 increases .",
    "then the conversion begins to dominate over dissatisfaction and the number of the followers of the ideology begins to increase .",
    "we shall call such a kind of growth of the followers of the ideology an inertial growth .    fig .",
    "1 illustrates an inertial growth . in fig .",
    "1a , it can be observed that the process of initial shrinking and then of inertial growth can exist for a large range of coefficient values .",
    "inertial growth can exist even if the ideology is weak with respect to its keeping of followers , i.e. when @xmath83 has large negative values .",
    "note that the figure illustrates the case when the carrying capacity of the environment is a constant .",
    "if the carrying capacity would change , one could observe sequences of phases of inertial growth and shrinking .",
    "1b shows that a small growth rate @xmath10 , i.e. of the total population , leads to a slowing down of the inertial growth process .",
    "in this section we will discuss the competition for adepts that the presence of a second ideology introduces ; this is leading to a measurable conflictual tension , as will be shown .",
    "let us consider the model system for the case of two ideologies with populations of followers @xmath38 and @xmath92 ; we assume that all parameters are kept constant .",
    "we have @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 let us quantify the tension between ideologies by means of an asymptotic analysis .",
    "we discuss the case of only unitary conversion of members of the population that are not followers of any of the ideologies . in order to emphasize the unitary conversion effects",
    "let us assume that the binary conversion as well as the unitary conversion from one ideology to the the other one are negligible . in this case @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in addition",
    "let us consider the asymptotic case in which the total population has reached the carrying capacity : @xmath99 .",
    "the equilibrium state is characterized by the fixed points : @xmath100 if the ideologies were without competition their size would be ; see the previous section @xmath101 it can thus be observed that the popularity of an ideology shrinks when competing ideology or ideologies spread around the country .",
    "let us evaluate this shrinking .",
    "we have @xmath102 as a numerical example let @xmath103 and @xmath104",
    ". then @xmath105 , i.e. the number of followers of the ideology 1 descreases by 40% .",
    "of course this causes some tension between the ideologies . a measure of this tension can be through the index @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the population of the followers of the @xmath13-th ideology when the @xmath26-th ideology is presented in the country too . if the ideology is alone then @xmath108 and the tension index is @xmath109 . if @xmath38 decreases because of the competition with the second ideology , then the tension between the ideologies characterised by the tension index @xmath110 increases .",
    "the above definition for the tension holds even if @xmath38 follows some time dependent trajectory .",
    "the tension index can be generalized for the case of an arbitrary number of ideologies in the country ( next section for example ) .",
    "let @xmath111 ideologies be presented in the country .",
    "the tension on @xmath13-th ideology in presence of two other ideologies , @xmath26 and @xmath112 is @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the population of followers of the @xmath13-th ideology when the ideologies @xmath26 and @xmath112 operate in the country too .",

    "we can define a series of indices for the quantification of the tensions among ideologies competing for followers ( in the same country ) .",
    "2 shows typical results from the numerical investigation of ( [ mod1 ] ) -([mod4 ] ) .",
    "2a shows the purely inertial growth of a population of followers of ideology 2 and its decline , followed by the inertial growth of the population of followers of ideology 1 . in fig .",
    "2b one can observe an initial decline followed by an inertial growth of the number of followers of @xmath117 ideologies .",
    "these results can be usefully compared to a model of telecommunication competition @xcite where it is concluded that ( we quote ) \" schemes targeting local cliques within the network are more successful at gaining a larger share of the population than those that target users randomly at a global scale ( e.g. , television commercials , print ads , etc . ) .",
    "this suggests that success in the competition is dependent not only on the number of individuals in the population but also on how they are connected in the network .",
