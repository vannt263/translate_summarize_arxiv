    "like other forms of topological entanglement of polymeric chains , knots have relevant consequences for both physics and biology @xcite .",
    "it is known that they can be found in long closed macromolecules @xcite , such as circular dna @xcite , and that they can affect important physical properties of them .",
    "for example , the migration velocity of circular dna in gel electrophoresis depends on the knot type @xcite . among the various properties of knotted polymers ,",
    "the determination of the _ length _ of the knots inside them , i.e. the length of the part of the chain which in some sense `` contains '' the entanglement responsible for the overall knottedness , has attracted much attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "indeed , the length of the knotted portion of the chain can be expected to play an important role in determining its physical properties .",
    "for example , the diffusion coefficient of knots tied into dna by micromanipulation techniques should depend on the average size of the knots @xcite .",
    "the action of topoisomerase on knotted dna surely depends on how localized the knot is @xcite .",
    "the folding dynamics of a knotted protein @xcite should also depend on the size of the knot .",
    "+ the determination , and even the definition , of the knot length , for real , 3d polymers , is however quite difficult .",
    "thus , historically , the problem was first faced for simplified models in which one imagines that a knotted polymer ring is confined in two dimensions . in this way",
    "the conformations of the ring reduce to those of a polymer network in 2d .",
    "the network is made only of loops and , under simplifying assumptions , maintains a fixed topology .",
    "these objects are called _ flat knots _ @xcite .",
    "one possible physical realization of flat knots , which allows to trace a link between them and `` real '' knots , is the following : think of a knotted polymer in 3d , and imagine it is fully adsorbed on an attractive , flat surface ; the polymer will then become two dimensional , and will consist of loops , since the original 3d chain was topologically a circle .",
    "the loops are made of segments joined at vertices , which in general correspond to overlaps of the adsorbed 3d polymer on itself .",
    "usually , in the flat knot model the information on the sign of crossings is not taken into account .",
    "one can study the length of the `` knot '' inside this object , at least under some simplifying assumptions : namely , the number of crossings must be kept constant and at the minimum value compatible with the corresponding topology in 3d . in fact , in such a case the network will consist of a fixed number @xmath2 of segments , while the knot length , @xmath3 , can be unambiguously put equal to the total length of the @xmath4 _ smaller _ ones .",
    "now , one basic question about the knot length is whether knots are _ localized _ or not .",
    "knots are said to be localized if , sending the polymer length @xmath5 to infinity , their ( average ) length @xmath6 does not grow as fast as @xmath5 .",
    "this means that , in the _ thermodynamic limit _ ( @xmath7 ) , the knot will behave as a point - like object with respect to the whole polymer .",
    "more precisely , the localization can be of two types : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is said to be @xmath8 when @xmath10 grows slower than any power of @xmath5 ( e.g. , as @xmath11 ) , while it is @xmath9 if @xmath12 , with the exponent @xmath13 strictly less than 1 ( but larger than 0 ) .",
    "when a knot is @xmath14 , @xmath6 grows as fast as @xmath5 : in this case the knot will always occupy an extended part of the entire chain . from the point of view of statistical mechanics ,",
    "the determination of the localization behaviour of knots is a most interesting issue , since the exponent @xmath13 is expected to be a _ universal _",
    "( model independent ) quantity .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that research on knot length has focused on this aspect ; this is true for flat knots as well as for 3d knots , whose study inherited some terminology , and some ideas , of flat knot theory . for",
    "flat knots , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , and theoretical calculations which employ the theory of polymer networks @xcite , allow to make predictions on the value of @xmath13 .",
    "it turns out that flat knots are _ strongly _ localized in the good solvent regime @xcite , but undergo a delocalization transition , and become delocalized , below the @xmath15 point @xcite .",
    "+ the study of the localization behaviour of 3d knots is more recent , and has been performed employing original strategies and computer simulations for a consistent statistical definition of knot length @xcite .",
    "indeed , the analytical treatment of the statistical mechanics of polymers constrained to have the topology of a nontrivial knot is very hard @xcite ; this is mainly due to the _ non - local _ character of the knottedness constraint , which makes impossible its description by a _",
    "hamiltonian , and thus prevents , e.g. , the use of standard field - theoretical techniques .",
    "the monte carlo results obtained in @xcite for @xmath6 as a function of @xmath5 have shown that prime knots in 3d are _ weakly _ localized , in the good solvent regime , with exponent @xmath16 .",
    "the weak localization of 3d knots and the value of @xmath13 determined in @xcite for saps on the cubic lattice have been subsequentially confirmed by simulations of off - lattice models @xcite .    since flat knots",
    "should describe fully adsorbed knotted polymers , they are a useful model _ per se _ , and not only for the indirect , qualitative insights they provide into 3d knots .",
    "adsorbed polymers are in fact extensively studied @xcite and the adsorption transition is an important paradigm of polymer statistics @xcite .",
    "+ for polymer rings adsorbed on a plane it is known that knotting can occur , and it has even been proven , for specific models , that it occurs with probability 1 for infinitely long chains @xcite .",
    "thus , the behaviour of knots should be expected to play an important role in determining the physical properties of adsorbed polymers , as it does for swollen chains in 3d space .",
    "flat knots represent only an extremely schematic model of adsorbed knotted polymers . in fact , a realistic model of an adsorbed polymer is given by a system consisting of a 3d polymer interacting with a short - range attractive , impenetrable , plane .",
    "it is known @xcite that , in the case of unrestricted topology , this system exhibits a phase diagram with a desorbed phase at high temperature @xmath17 and an adsorbed phase at low @xmath17 ; these two regimes are separated by a phase transition at a certain critical temperature @xmath18 . at @xmath19 the polymer becomes a fully adsorbed 2d object , except possibly for @xmath20 ( which are always present if the topology of the polymer is different from that of an unknot ) .",
    "thus , the ground state of real adsorbed knotted polymers should be described by flat knots ; but for any nonzero @xmath17 , adsorbed polymers have @xmath21 ( i.e. connected bunches of desorbed monomers ) which can be quite extended , even if they have finite length on average .",
    "+ so it is not clear if the true behaviour of real adsorbed knots for @xmath22 should be similar to that of polymer networks of fixed topology , or of their fully 3-dimensional counterparts , or , maybe , of something in between .",
    "recent measurements @xcite , on samples of knotted dna adsorbed on a substrate , indicate that knots are rather localized .",
    "however , the chains in @xcite seem not to behave as fully 2d objects .",
    "for example , the measured @xmath1 exponent is between the 2d and the 3d value .",
    "thus , a full explanation of the behaviour of these polymers may require to go beyond the simple flat knot model .",
    "the model of adsorbed polymers we are going to study may be useful in this respect .    in this work we study the adsorption process of knotted ring polymers by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "we focus on the adsorption transition and the low temperature ( adsorbed ) regime , for the simplest prime knots ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "we check their thermodynamic properties , in order to trace any significative difference between the behaviour of polymers with a fixed knot type and that of polymers with unrestricted topology .",
    "we estimate the temperature dependence of the average knot length @xmath6 and search for a possible transition between the @xmath27 regime , where knots are expected to be weakly localized , and the fully - adsorbed one ( @xmath19 ) , which corresponds to flat knots and thus to an expected strong localization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the model and the mc algorithms we use for the simulations . in section",
    "iii we present the numerical results and discuss the knot localization properties in different regimes .",
    "we close this section with a discussion on the relation between knotted polymers in the strongly adsorbed regime and the model of flat knots .",
    "section iv contains our conclusions .",
    "a flexible polymer ring of @xmath5 monomers close to an impenetrable surface can be modelled by an @xmath5-step self - avoiding polygon ( sap ) on the cubic lattice confined to the half - space @xmath28 and with at least one vertex anchored at the @xmath29 plane . to include a short - range attractive interaction between the surface and the polymer , an energy -1 is assigned to each vertex of the sap having @xmath29 ( visit ) . denoting by @xmath30 the number of visits of a given configuration @xmath31 the equilibrium properties of the model are described by the partition function @xmath32 where @xmath17 is the absolute temperature and @xmath33 is boltzmann s constant . if the sum in eq .",
    "( [ zeta ] ) extends to configurations @xmath31 with all possile topologies , this model displays , in the thermodynamic limit , a second order phase transition from a desorbed ( high @xmath17 ) phase to an adsorbed one ( low @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "in particular there exists @xmath34 such that the limiting free energy @xmath35 is equal to @xmath36 , independent of @xmath17 , for all @xmath37 and is strictly greater than @xmath36 for all @xmath38 @xcite . the limiting value @xmath39 denotes the critical fugacity of standard , non interacting 3d saps @xcite .",
    "let @xmath40 be the average number of visits and @xmath41 the limiting fraction of visits .",
    "then for all @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( desorbed phase ) and for all @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( adsorbed phase ) .",
    "right at the transition temperature @xmath46 @xcite one expects @xmath47 where @xmath0 is the crossover exponent which is believed to be very close to @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "another way to detect the adsorption transition is by looking at the metric exponent @xmath1 that controls the scaling of the radius of gyration through the power law @xmath49 indeed for @xmath50 one expects@xmath51 , i.e the value for 3d saps @xcite while for @xmath52 the value @xmath53 of 2d saps @xcite should be recovered .",
    "+ the adsorption transition is one of the most succesfully studied transitions in the polymer literature @xcite , but if one restricts the sum of the partition function ( [ zeta ] ) to saps with a given knot type very few results are available so far .",
    "one of these is the rigorous , strict , bound @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the limiting free energy ( [ zeta ] ) restricted to the set of unknotted saps @xcite . inequality ( [ zetao ] ) implies that for every finite value of @xmath17 the probability that the polygon is knotted goes to one as @xmath5 goes to infinity @xcite",
    ". the only exception would be the set of saps lying completely on the plane @xmath29 ( 2d saps )",
    "i.e. the zero temperature limit for adsorbing rings .",
    "of course , the knotting probability for finite @xmath5 will depend on @xmath17 and this has been investigated numerically @xcite .",
    "no further studies have been performed so far on the effect of topological constraints on the adsorption transition but some reasonable assumptions can still be made .",
    "for example , one should expect that universal exponents such as the crossover exponent @xmath0 and the metric exponent @xmath1 do not depend on topological constraints . on the other hand , the critical temperature @xmath18 ,",
    "could change when switching from the unrestricted to a restricted topology ensemble , but there is no strong theoretical insight on what should happen . also , we can not tell whether @xmath18 should depend on the specific knot type or not .",
    "given the difficulty in making any progress in this problem by analytical or rigorous means a natural way to gain insight is by monte carlo simulations .",
    "for a fixed temperature @xmath17 , saps with a fixed knot type are generated by using a monte carlo approach based on the bfacf algorithm , @xcite .",
    "this is an algorithm which samples along a markov chain in the configuration space of polygons of variable @xmath5 and with fixed knot type .",
    "the statistical ensemble considered is thus grand canonical , with a fugacity @xmath56 assigned to each polygon step .",
    "we adopt this algorithm because it preserves the topology and is irreducible within each set of configurations having the same knot type @xcite . at a given @xmath17",
    "we used a multiple markov chain ( mmc ) procedure @xcite in which configurations are exchanged among ensembles having different step fugacities  @xcite .",
    "this is done in order to improve the efficiency of the sampling , especially at low @xmath17 where the saps are strongly adsorbed on the plane .",
    "the temperatures we considered are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , all much less then @xmath18 .",
    "we also consider the value @xmath61 ( non interacting case ) in order to compare it with the known situation of unweighted and geometrically unrestricted saps in 3d @xcite .    despite the use of the mmc sampling technique ,",
    "the bfacf algorithm becomes quite inefficient in the strongly adsorbed phase and for high values of @xmath5 . to improve the sampling in this regime we decided to use an hybrid scheme based on a combination of the bfacf with the pivot algorithm @xcite .",
    "since any pivot move can change the knot type of the resulting sap @xcite , a check of its topology is needed before the move itself can be accepted .",
    "this is done by calculating the alexander polynomial @xmath62 in @xmath63 and @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "the bfacf algorithm does not preserve the value of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , in order to extract canonical averages at fixed @xmath5 , we bin the data according to their @xmath5 value . to collect enough statistics for a given @xmath5 we used bins of width 10 . in this respect",
    "the symbol @xmath65 indicates for us averages taken within a bin centered in @xmath5 and with size @xmath66 .",
    "the knot types considered in the simulations are the prime knots @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , most of the results we present here refer to the trefoil knot ( @xmath67 ) .    for each sampled sap the length @xmath3 of the hosted knot @xmath68 is measured by determining the shortest possible arc that contains the knot .",
    "the procedure works as follows @xcite : given a knotted configuration , open arcs of different length are extracted by employing a recursive procedure .",
    "each arc is then converted into a loop by joining its ends at infinity ( i.e. , at very far dinstance ) with a suitable path .",
    "the presence of the original knot is finally checked by computing , on the resulting loop , the alexander polynomial @xmath69 in @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see @xcite for details ) . in all the simulations",
    "considered we sample , for each value of @xmath56 , over 20000 ( independent ) configurations . since for fixed @xmath17 a mmc scheme with @xmath66 different @xmath56 values",
    "is used , the total number of configurations considered in the statistics of a given @xmath17 amounts to @xmath70 .",
    "to check the validity of our approach we first compare the known situation of 3d swollen saps @xcite with the one of saps confined in the upper half space by an impenetrable non attractive plane ( non interacting case ) . since the constraint @xmath28 should not play a significant role in knot localization , we expect strong similarities between the two cases .",
    "a first interesting issue concerns the the value of @xmath71 for the non interacting and confined problem compared to the one ( @xmath72 ) of the 3d case . for the whole class of saps ( unrestricted topology )",
    "it is known that @xmath73 @xcite but no information is available about the relation between @xmath74 and @xmath75 i.e. for the corresponding quantities for saps with fixed knot type @xmath68 . by using a mmc with 10 different @xmath56 s ranging from @xmath76 up to @xmath77  @xcite we obtain a good evidence ( within the confidence limit and for the prime knots considered ) that @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "we also confirm that at @xmath27 the metric exponent @xmath1 coincides ( within error bars ) in the two cases and that is independent on the knot type ( we estimate @xmath79 for all knots considered ) .",
    "we now turn out attention to the behavior of the average knot length @xmath10 as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "previous studies have shown that for 3d swollen knotted saps @xmath80 with @xmath81 for the trefoil @xcite .",
    "do we have the same behavior if the @xmath67 saps are confined into one half space by an impenetrable ( but still not attractive ) plane ?",
    "this seems to be the case as witnessed by fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where a log - log plot of @xmath10 as a function of @xmath5 is reported for the two situations .",
    "the two curves look indeed linear and parallel to each other , confirming a weak localization regime with an exponent @xmath13 that is the same ( within error bars ) in the two cases .     as a function of @xmath5 for saps in the bulk ( bottom curve ) and for knotted saps confined in the @xmath82 half space ( top curve ) . in both cases",
    "the hosted knot is the trefoil knot ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "@xmath12 holds in both cases with @xmath83 .",
    "this value is consistent with the estimated for 3d saps in the bulk @xcite . ]",
    "when the attractive interaction between the sap and the plane is switched on , the entropy is not any more the only ingredient in determining the equilibrium properties of the system . instead",
    ", equilibrium is determined by the interplay between entropy and the energy gain in flattening the polymer on the plane . moreover , when the topology of the ring is restricted to a fixed knot type , an additional entropic effect arises , because the entropy of rings with fixed topology and of rings with unrestricted topology are different .    from a numerical point of view , simulations of saps in the adsorbed regime require more effort than those for the desorbed one .",
    "let @xmath84 be the critical fugacity for adsorbing saps at temperature @xmath17 and with knot type @xmath68 . for @xmath37 ( desorbed regime ) , one can indeed assume , by analogy with the unrestricted case , @xmath85 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath86 ( adsorbed phase ) , @xmath84 should decrease as the temperature decreases @xcite and one can not rely any more on a known value of @xmath71 for simulations at a given @xmath17 . hence , for each value @xmath86 considered the value of @xmath87 must be estimated first ( by short mc runs ) before collecting a significant amount of data for that temperature .",
    "figure [ lknotallt ] shows the average knot size @xmath88 as a function of @xmath5 for saps with a trefoil knot tied in .",
    "different curves correspond to different temperatures ranging from @xmath89 , a value just above the adsorption transition for the unrestricted case , down to @xmath58 , a value deep into the adsorbed phase .",
    "the plot in the noninteracting case is also reported for comparison .",
    "one can notice that the @xmath5 behavior of @xmath10 for saps close to the adsorption point @xmath90 coincides with the one obtained for the non interacting case .",
    "being the adsorption point the last point of the desorbed phase , this result shows that in this phase knots are weakly localized with exponent @xmath13 that does not depend on @xmath17 , and coincides with the one found for 3d saps . below the adsorption transition",
    "the situation changes significantly : the average knot length still follows a power law behavior ( [ scal ] ) with @xmath5 , but the exponent @xmath13 decreases as @xmath17 decreases . more interestingly ,",
    "if we go deeper into the adsorbed phase ( @xmath91 ) and look for sufficiently large @xmath5 , @xmath10 tends to a constant value .",
    "this is a signal of a strong localization regime ( @xmath92 ) , reminiscent of the one found for flat knots  @xcite .     as a function of @xmath5 for saps with knot @xmath23 .",
    "different curves correspond to decreasing ( from top to bottom ) values of the temperature .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the non interacting case .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath13 can be deduced from the values of @xmath93 reported in table ii . ]",
    "clearly if @xmath92 , eq . ( [ scal ] ) does not give any insight into the degree of localization of knots .",
    "more detailed information can be however obtained by analyzing the @xmath5 behavior of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the knot length , @xmath94 @xcite . in analogy with previous works on similar problems",
    "@xcite one can assume the following scaling form : @xmath95 where the scaling function @xmath96 is expected to approach rapidly zero as soon as @xmath97 , ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath99 is a cutoff on the maximum value @xmath3 can assume .",
    "we expect @xmath100 , because there is no reason _ a priori _ to think that there exists some ` topological cutoff ' which limits the size of the knot .",
    "this is confirmed by our measurements , which yield @xmath101 at every @xmath17 .",
    "assuming @xmath96 is integrable when its argument is sufficiently large , one can deduce that , for @xmath102 , @xmath103 , while @xmath104 always implies @xmath92 .",
    "in this respect the desorbed phase ( where @xmath105 ) is characterized by @xmath106 @xcite , while at @xmath19 ( fully adsorbed polymer ) we could expect @xmath107 i.e. the value found for flat knots @xcite .    a common technique to analyze the scaling of the pdf ( [ scalp ] ) goes as follows : for a trial value of @xmath93 and fixed @xmath5 , one plots @xmath108 versus @xmath109 .",
    "clearly , by varying @xmath5 different curves are displayed but if the values of @xmath93 and @xmath110 are close to the correct ones , all these curves should collapse onto a single one described by @xmath96 . eventually , after several trials , `` optimal '' values of @xmath93 and @xmath110 can be estimated .",
    "unfortunately , to have a good matching of the curves an extremely good statistics is required , and this would not be feasible in this context .",
    "we can instead perform an analysis based on the scaling behavior of the moments of the pdf in eq .",
    "@xmath111  @xcite .",
    "this method relies on the following consideration : given the scaling behavior ( [ scalp ] ) for the pdf , its @xmath112-th moment @xmath113 should obey the asymptotic law : @xmath114 and the two parameters @xmath110 and @xmath93 can be deduced by fitting the estimated exponents @xmath115 against the order @xmath112 @xcite and performing a finite size scaling analysis ( see figure [ fig:2 ] ) .     for @xmath58 .",
    "for each value of @xmath112 ( @xmath112 increases monotonically from bottom to top ) , @xmath115 is obtained by fitting the data of @xmath116 as a function of @xmath5 with a power - law in the range between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , with @xmath119 . here , different curves , corresponding to different values of @xmath112 ranging from @xmath120 ( bottom curve ) to @xmath121 ( top curve ) , are shown . to extract the asymptotic values we compute @xmath115 as a function of @xmath117 and",
    "extrapolate these values as @xmath122 : this gives our best estimate of @xmath115 . ]    as shown in figure [ fig:3 ] for the @xmath58 case , the plots of @xmath115 show deviations from linearity at relatively low @xmath112 , due to finite @xmath5 scaling correction effects .",
    "this is typical for this kind of analysis @xcite .",
    "however , for a sufficiently wide range of @xmath112 , a linear behavior can be identified whose intercept gives an estimate of @xmath93 .     for @xmath58 and for the knot @xmath67 .",
    "the exponents @xmath115 , calculated as described in the caption of the previous picture and in the main text , are plotted against @xmath112 .",
    "for @xmath123 a good linear behavior is obtained and a linear fit in that range of @xmath112 gives the estimate of @xmath93 . ]    repeating the above procedure for the different temperatures considered one obtains the estimates plotted in figure [ tau_t ] and reported in table [ table1 ] .    for @xmath124",
    "the value of @xmath93 is roughly @xmath125 _ independent on @xmath17_. this is consistent with the findings presented in the previous section .",
    "indeed , in the desorbed regime ( and up to the adsorption point included ) the knot length exponent @xmath13 is @xmath126 .",
    "as the temperature is lowered the polymer goes more deeply into the adsorbed phase and the @xmath93 exponent increases reaching , at @xmath58 , the value @xmath127 .",
    "the curve in figure [ tau_t ] furnishes a good evidence that knots in the adsorbed regime become strongly localized .",
    "the value of @xmath93 at @xmath58 ( @xmath128 ) agrees within the error bars with the value @xmath129 found for flat knots , but it is possible that such value is reached precisely only in the @xmath130 limit .     for saps at the adsorption transition ( @xmath90 ) and in the adsorbed phase ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "the knot considered is the trefoil . for @xmath132 ,",
    "we get @xmath133 , independently on @xmath17 ( desorbed phase ) this is consistent with @xmath103 and the expected value ( @xmath105 ) found in this regime . ]",
    "one could take the intersection between the curve in figure  [ tau_t ] and the line @xmath134 as an estimate of a transition point @xmath135 between the weak and the strong localization regimes .",
    "this would suggest a localization transition occuring well below the adsorption transition . on the other hand ,",
    "the curve in figure  [ tau_t ] is an estimate of @xmath136 that relies on finite @xmath5 simulations and it is hard to decide whether @xmath136 would show a sharp discontinuity as @xmath137 .",
    "most intriguing would be the possibility of a range of temperatures in which the exponent @xmath93 varies with @xmath17 .",
    ".estimates of the exponent @xmath93 for different values of @xmath17 for trefoil knots .",
    "they have been obtained by the finite size scaling analysis of the moments of the knot length as explained in the text . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath138 determinations are always slightly higher than those of @xmath1 and have slightly larger error bars .",
    "this is due to two effects : @xmath3 varies on a smaller range than @xmath5 , and the data for @xmath139 are noisier too .",
    "the measured values of @xmath138 are however comparable , within error bars , with the values of @xmath1 for the whole sap . at _",
    "very _ low @xmath17 , when knots become strongly localized the error bars on the estimates of @xmath138 are quite big .",
    "this is mainly due to the relatively small values of @xmath140 ( between 16 and 100 ) that do not allow a good asymptotic analysis of ( [ rknot ] ) .",
    "our results show that the degree of localization of prime knots appear to be independent on the knot type ( see table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the theory of flat knots which shows that , at leading order , all prime knots can be asymptotically described by the _ figure 8 _ graph reported in figure [ fig : graf8 ] ,     is the total length of the ring while @xmath141 is the length of the _ shorter _ loop , that can be identified with the knot length @xmath3 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that , when @xmath142 , the pdf for @xmath141 scales as @xmath143 , with @xmath144 . ]",
    "whose behavior in the good solvent regime determines their strong localization @xcite .",
    "however , adsorbed knots do not show the same degree of localization ( measured by the exponent @xmath93 presented above ) as flat knots .",
    "in fact , they are always somehow less localized , i.e. they show values of @xmath93 lower than that provided by flat knot theory .",
    "note however that for @xmath58 the @xmath93 values for adsorbed and flat knots are comparable within 2 standard deviations . on the other hand , since the monte carlo procedure deteriorates as @xmath17 decreases it would not be useful to try to go deeper in the adsorbed phase .",
    "indeed , there we where we would just estimate other values of @xmath93 that would possibly match better with the flat knot value , but with larger error bars .",
    "we can then conclude that strongly adsorbed polymers should eventually behave as flat knots .",
    "if this happens at some @xmath145 with @xmath146 or just in the limit @xmath147 it is however impossible to establish within our numerical precision . +",
    "another distinction between adsorbed knotted rings and flat knots concerns the number of crossings , @xmath148 , the chain makes with itself when it is _ regularly _ projected on the adsorbing plane  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the flat knot model the number of crossings is minimal ( @xmath149 for the @xmath67 , @xmath150 for @xmath151 , etc ) .",
    "this is crucial for the analytical treatment of the model and it would be interesting to see how close is the behaviour of the strongly adsorbed rings to this assumption .",
    "it turns out that while the average number of crossings , @xmath152 , of the _ whole chain _ increases ( approximately linearly ) with @xmath5 , the same quantity restricted to the knotted portion is approximatively constant and close to the minimum value allowed by the topology .",
    "for example , @xmath153 .",
    "the independence of @xmath5 is quite reasonable since deep into the adsorbed phase knots are strongly localized .",
    "moreover , strongly adsorbed rings tend to minimize their energy by maximizing the number of visits and , in the limit @xmath130 , we should expect all the unimportant crossings to disappear leaving a 2d ring with just the essential ( topological ) crossings defining the knot @xcite .",
    "+ at @xmath154 , however , fluctuations in the number of crossings are present and this could explain the deviation of the @xmath93 exponent from the flat knot value for finite @xmath17 values . in this respect , it could be useful to study the behavior of flat knots when the restriction on the minimal crossing number is relaxed .",
    "recently , guitter and orlandini @xcite introduced a model of flat knots on a lattice where the ring is a 2d polygon with a number of crossings which can be changed and tuned with an appropriate crossing fugacity . by implementing our knot detection technique on this model",
    "we have estimated the average knot size for flat knots as a function of @xmath5 for a wide range of values of the average crossing number .",
    "we find that flat knots are always strongly localized , independently of the average crossing number .",
    "this suggests that the crossing number is not a key feature to explain the value of @xmath93 and that the flat knot model , even with a fluctuating number of crossings , is not a fair model for knotted rings in the adsorbed phase unless @xmath130 .",
    "in this paper we study by monte carlo simulations the equilibrium properties of self avoiding polygons with fixed topology ( knot ) adsorbing onto an impenetrable wall . for unrestricted topology",
    "it is known that saps undergo an adsorption transition from a desorbed 3d swollen phase to an adsorbed phase .",
    "we first show that for saps with fixed topology the adsorption transition is still present .",
    "moreover , we give numerical evidence that the metric exponent @xmath1 in the adsorbed and desorbed phases and the crossover exponent @xmath0 for saps with fixed topology , agree with the ones for the unrestricted topology case .",
    "even non - universal quantities such as the critical adsorption temperature @xmath155 and the critical fugacity @xmath72 seem to be unaffected by the topological constraint .    by using a novel algorithm that allows the identification of the knotted portion of the sap @xcite we are able to focus on the equilibrium critical properties of this portion and compare them with those the whole sap .",
    "we show that the knotted part behaves , in most respects , as any other connected subset of the ring with the same length .",
    "for example , we find that at @xmath156 the average energy of the knot scales as @xmath157 where the value of @xmath0 agrees with that of the whole ring .",
    "the metric exponent of the knot @xmath138 , which describes the scaling of the radius of gyration of the knotted part of the ring as a function of the knot length , is also consistent with the value of @xmath1 of the whole chain at every temperature .",
    "furthermore , the average displacement of the knot from the plane ( height ) is the same of that of the whole ring , indicating that there is not a preferred height in space for the knotted portion .",
    "the main emphasis of our work is however on the localization behavior of the knotted portion of the ring as @xmath17 varies .",
    "we find that , for @xmath158 , the average length @xmath10 of the knotted portion grows as @xmath159 where @xmath160 , consistent with the value found in @xcite for knotted rings in the 3d bulk .",
    "this shows that knots in the desorbed phase and right at the adsorption transition are weakly localized , i.e. the presence of an attracting impenetrable plane does not change the localization properties of the knot . below @xmath18 ,",
    "the knot becomes more and more localized reaching a strong localization regime deep into the adsorbed phase .",
    "this crossover to more localized states is certainly triggered by the adsorption transition , but is quite smooth , as witnessed by the @xmath17 dependence of the estimated localization exponent @xmath13 .",
    "thus , we can not exclude that below @xmath18 there is a _ continuous variation _ of the exponent @xmath13 with @xmath17 .",
    "a possible alternative scenario is the existence of a sharp localization transition at some @xmath161 , such that @xmath13 has the bulk value for @xmath162 , while @xmath92 ( and @xmath107 ) ) below . to justify this latter scenario",
    ", one must assume that our data are affected by strong finite - size corrections , which can not be numerically detected unless one performs simulations at much larger values of @xmath5 .",
    "note , however , that , even under this assumption , the possibility that @xmath163 should be discarded in account of the observation that @xmath13 starts to decrease only below @xmath18 ; a crossover region is expected to be more symmetric around the transition temperature @xmath135 . for sufficiently low values of @xmath17 ( deep in the adsorbed phase ) the estimated @xmath93 exponent agrees , within error bars , with the one found for flat knots .",
    "however , due to the large statistical uncertainty we can not rule out the possibility that the flat knot regime is reached only in the limit @xmath164 .",
    "these results suggest that the relation between the flat knots model and adsorbed knots is nontrivial .",
    "the flat knot regime is reached only at low enough @xmath17 ( or possibly at @xmath130 ) where the number of crossings , arising from a regular projection on the adsorbing plane , is close to the minimal value dictated by the topology . on the other hand , in the whole adsorbed phase many excursions in the bulk",
    "are allowed and give rise to a number of crossings that exceed the minimal one and that can fluctuate widely as @xmath5 increases .",
    "these fluctuations are certainly responsible for the deviations from flat - knot behaviour observed at high enough @xmath17 .",
    "the flat knot model is certainly not an adequate representation of knotted rings in the whole adsorbed phase .",
