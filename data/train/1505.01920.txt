    "dense small cell networks ( scns ) are considered as the most promising approach to rapidly increase network capacity and meet the ever - increasing capacity demands in the 5th generation ( 5 g ) systems  @xcite . however , up to now , most theoretical studies on scns only consider simple path loss models that do not differentiate line - of - sight ( los ) and non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) transmissions  [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "the major conclusion  [ 2 - 5 ] is that neither the number of small cells nor the number of cell tiers changes the coverage probability in interference - limited fully - loaded cellular networks .",
    "such conclusion implies that the area spectral efficiency ( ase ) will monotonically grow as small cells go dense .",
    "an intriguing question is : does this optimistic conclusion still hold when practical los and nlos transmissions are considered in scns ?",
    "it is well - known that los transmission often occurs when the distance between a transmitter and a receiver is small , while nlos is more common in long - distance transmissions as well as in office environments and in central business districts . for a given network environment ,",
    "when the distance between transmitter and receiver decreases , the probability that an los path exists between them increases , causing a _ transition _ from nlos transmission to los transmission . to the best of authors knowledge , up to",
    "now , performance analysis considering both los and nlos transmissions are  @xcite and  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors assumed a multi - slope piece - wise path loss function .",
    "such multi - slope piece - wise path loss function does not fit well with the nlos and los model defined by the 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) standards , in which the path loss function is not a one - to - one mapping to the distance  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors treated the event of los or nlos transmission as a probabilistic event for a millimetre wave communication scenario . to simplify the analysis ,",
    "the los probability function was approximated by a moment - matched equivalent step function .",
    "the single - piece path loss model and the proposed step function for modeling the transition from nlos to los transmissions are also not compatible with the model recommended by the 3gpp  [ 8 , 9 ] . in this paper",
    ", we use a general path loss model that features piece - wise path loss functions with probabilistic los and nlos transmissions .",
    "note that the proposed model is very general and includes almost all existing models used to capture los and nlos transmissions  [ 6 - 9 ] as its special cases .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are as follows :    * analytical results are obtained for the coverage probability and the ase using a general path loss model incorporating both los and nlos transmissions . *",
    "using the above results , closed - form expressions are further obtained for the coverage probability and the ase for a special case based on the 3gpp standards . *",
    "our theoretical analysis reveals an important finding , i.e. , the ase will initially increase with the increase of the small cell density , but when the density of small cells becomes sufficiently large , the network coverage probability will decrease as small cells become denser .",
    "this in turn makes the ase suffer from a slow growth or even a notable _ decrease_. thereafter , when the small cell density is very large , the ase will then grow almost linearly with the network densification",
    ". these results are not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different from previous study results  [ 2 - 7 ] .",

    "<S> in this paper , we introduce a sophisticated path loss model into the stochastic geometry analysis incorporating both line - of - sight ( los ) and non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) transmissions to study their performance impact in small cell networks ( scns ) . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results are obtained on the coverage probability and the area spectral efficiency ( ase ) assuming both a general path loss model and a special case of path loss model recommended by the 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) standards . </S>",
    "<S> the performance impact of los and nlos transmissions in scns in terms of the coverage probability and the ase is shown to be significant both quantitatively and qualitatively , compared with previous work that does not differentiate los and nlos transmissions . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , our analysis demonstrates that when the density of small cells is larger than a threshold , the network coverage probability will decrease as small cells become denser , which in turn makes the ase suffer from a slow growth or even a notable _ decrease_. for practical regime of small cell density , the performance results derived from our analysis are distinctively different from previous results , and shed new insights on the design and deployment of future dense / ultra - dense scns . </S>"
