    "shortly after the discovery of superconductivity in copper - oxyde compounds,@xcite anderson proposed a gutzwiller - projected bcs wave function which would describe the superconducting ground state of high - temperature superconductors.@xcite the variational approach to superconducting cuprates based on anderson s original proposal has since had a lot of success , while the strong coulomb repulsion and the non - perturbative nature of the problem make other approaches extremely difficult .",
    "interest in projected wave functions as variational ground states for cuprate superconductors was initiated by several research groups in late 80 s @xcite and lead to a considerable activity in the field .",
    "the projected wave functions show large overlap with exact ground states on small clusters and have low variational energies for the @xmath2 model.@xcite furthermore , several experimental properties of cuprates like the zero - temperature phase diagram and d - wave pairing symmetry are extremely well predicted within this approach.@xcite    due to considerable progress of the experimental technique of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) on cuprates , more and more high - quality data on the low - lying spectral properties of these compounds have been made available in recent years.@xcite experimentally , the low - energy excitations of superconducting cuprates are known to resemble bcs quasiparticles ( qps).@xcite it is therefore interesting to theoretically explore the wave function of projected qp excitations and compare them to unprojected bcs qps .",
    "the most apparent differences are the the doping dependency of the nodal fermi velocity and the renormalizations of the nodal qp spectral weight and of the current carried by qps.@xcite in the present paper we further analyze the properties of the superconducting ground state and the qp excitations with the variational monte carlo technique ( vmc).@xcite we calculate the equal - time green s functions , both normal and anomalous , in the gutzwiller - projected state and derive from them the qp spectral weights for addition and removal of an electron at zero temperature .",
    "the main conclusion of our study is that , due to a non - trivial interplay of superconductivity and strong coulomb repulsion ( projection ) , the electron and hole spectral weights are renormalized differently .",
    "a natural way to describe this asymmetry is to define the `` effective fermi surface '' as the locus of points where the electron and the hole spectral weights are equal .",
    "thus defined fermi surface acquires an additional outward bending in the anti - nodal region as compared to the original unprojected fermi surface .",
    "this bending is a signature of a deviation from the bcs theory and may be responsible for the shape of the fermi surface observed in arpes experiments .",
    "the validity of luttinger s rule@xcite in strongly interacting and superconducting materials has been questioned experimentally and theoretically recently.@xcite our findings provide further indication of its inapplicability in strongly correlated superconductors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] contains the definition of the model and wave functions used in our calculations . in section [ sec : weights ] we first present some exact relations for projected wave functions , we then describe our results on the qp spectral weights .",
    "section [ sec : sc ] is devoted to the calculation of the equal - time anomalous green s function .",
    "finally , section [ sec : fs ] defines the `` effective fermi surface '' and discusses its deviation from the unprojected one .",
    "in the tight - binding description , the cuprates are modeled by electrons hopping on a square lattice .",
    "the appropriate model is the @xmath0@xmath1 hamiltonian : @xmath3 acting in the hilbert - space with less than two electrons per site .",
    "here @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the electron creation operator in the wannier state at site @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the no - double occupancy is preserved by the gutzwiller projector @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1 model can be viewed as the large @xmath10 limit of the one - band hubbard model , neglecting the 3-site - hopping term .",
    "provided that the model is analytic in @xmath11 , doubly occupied sites can be re - introduced perturbatively to recover the full hilbert space of the hubbard model.@xcite although the inclusion of these corrections present no major difficulty , we chose to neglect them here . in most quantities ,",
    "only small corrections arise from finite double occupancy,@xcite which makes this approach to the large-@xmath10 hubbard model consistent .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that the @xmath0@xmath1 model is in fact more appropriate than the one - band hubbard model in describing the cuo planes.@xcite    we consider the usual variational ground state:@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the particle number projector on the subspace of @xmath14 electrons ; @xmath15 is the total number of sites .",

    "the wave function has two free parameters : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these variational parameters are chosen to minimize the energy of the @xmath0@xmath1 hamiltonian for the experimentally relevant value @xmath26 and for every doping level .",

    "it is known to have a considerable overlap with the true ground state of the @xmath0@xmath1 model at non - zero hole doping on small clusters.@xcite there is also numerical support from exact diagonalization studies indicating well defined bcs - like qps as low - energy excitations of the @xmath0@xmath1 model.@xcite therefore , the excited trial states are expected to be close to the true excitations of the @xmath0@xmath1 model . however , here we are more interested in the physical content of the proposed wave functions than in their closeness to the eigenstates of a particular hamiltonian.@xcite",
    "the qp spectral weights are defined as the overlap between the bare electron / hole added ground state and the qp excitations of the model : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the bare electron creation / anihilation operators .",
    "it is well - known that the qp spectral weight for adding an electron ( equal - time normal green s function ) can be calculated from the ground state spectral function:@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the hole concentration .    the qp spectral weight for adding a hole is more difficult to calculate .",
    "it is useful to note that it can also be calculated from ground state expectation values , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the superconducting order parameter ( equal - time anomalous green s function ) @xmath37 relation ( [ eq : zpm ] ) can be proven by algebraic manipulations with the gutzwiller projector .",
    "it is exact in finite systems and is also valid in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath38 remarkably , this relation holds for both the unprojected bcs state ( with @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) and the fully projected wave function .",
    "it would be interesting to explore if this relation is valid in a more general case of superconducting systems or if it is just a peculiarity of a certain class of wave functions .",
    "further , we define the total spectral weight @xmath41 the main contribution to @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 outside the fermi surface and by @xmath44 inside .",
    "we can prove an exact upper bound on @xmath42 : @xmath45 a proof may be performed by defining the two states    @xmath46    ( with this definition , @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath48 ) . using and",

    "figure  [ fig : nfs ] shows the contour plots of @xmath42 in the region of the brillouin where our method produces small error bars.@xcite from these data , we can make the following observations :    * in the case of an unprojected bcs wave function , the total spectral weight is constant and unity over the brillouin zone . introducing the projection operator",
    ", we see that for low doping ( @xmath72 ) , the spectral weight is reduced by a factor up to @xmath73 .",
    "the renormalization is asymmetric in the sense that the electronic spectral weight @xmath74 is more reduced than the hole spectral weight @xmath44 . for higher doping ( @xmath75 ) , the spectral weight reduction is much smaller and the electron - hole asymmetry decreases .",

    "[ fig : nfs ] we see that a similar ( but much weaker ) tendency can be observed in the framework of gutzwiller - projected wave functions .",

    "with the method employed here , we find the same qualitative and quantitative conclusions of previous authors:@xcite vanishing of superconductivity at half filling @xmath80 and at the superconducting transition on the overdoped side @xmath81.@xcite the optimal doping is near @xmath82 . in the same plot",

    "in strongly interacting fermi systems , the notion of a fermi surface ( fs ) is not at all clear .",
    "there are however several experimental definitions of the fs .",
    "most commonly , @xmath90 is determined in arpes experiments as the maximum of @xmath91 or the locus of minimal gap along some cut in the @xmath92-plane.@xcite the theoretically better defined locus of @xmath93 is also sometimes used .",
    "the various definitions of the fs usually agree within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "recently , the different definitions of the fs were theoretically analyzed in refs .  and  .",

    "the underlying fs is determined by the condition @xmath94 .",
    "we will refer to this as the _",
    "unprojected fs_. since @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the residues of the qp poles in the bcs theory , it is natural to replace them in the interacting case by @xmath74 and @xmath44 , respectively .",

    "the contour plot of the total qp weight is also shown .",
    "it is interesting to note the following points :    * in the underdoped region , the effective fs is open and bent outwards ( hole - like fs ) . in the overdoped region ,",
    "the effective fs closes and embraces more and more the unprojected one with increasing doping ( electron - like fs ) . *",
    "luttinger s rule@xcite is clearly violated in the underdoped region , i.e.  the area enclosed by the effective fs is not conserved by the interaction ; it is larger than that of the unprojected one .",
    "* in the optimally doped and overdoped region , the total spectral weight is approximately constant along the effective fs within error bars . in the highly underdoped region",
    ", we observe a small concentration of the spectral weight around the nodal point ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "it should be noted that a negative next - nearest hopping @xmath99 would lead to a similar fs curvature as we find in the underdoped region .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our original @xmath0@xmath1 hamiltonian as well as the variational states do not contain any @xmath99 .",
    "our results show that the outward curvature of the fs is due to strong coulomb repulsion , without need of @xmath99 .",
    "the next - nearest hopping terms in the microscopic description of the cuprates may not be necessary to explain the fs topology found in arpes experiments .",
    "remarkably , if the next - nearest hopping @xmath99 is included in the variational ansatz ( and not in the original @xmath0@xmath1 hamiltonian ) , a finite and negative @xmath99 is generated , as it was shown in ref .  .",
    "apparently , in this case the unprojected fs has the tendency to adjust to the effective fs .",
    "a similar bending of the fs was also reported in the recent analysis of the current carried by gutzwiller - projected qps.@xcite a high - temperature expansion of the momentum distribution function @xmath100 of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model was done in ref .",
    "where the authors find a violation of luttinger s rule and a negative curvature of the fs .",
    "our findings provide further evidence in this direction .",
    "a natural question is the role of superconductivity in the unconventional bending of the fs . in the limit @xmath101 , the variational states are gutzwiller - projected excitations of the fermi sea and the spectral weights are step - functions at the ( unprojected ) fs . in a recent paper@xcite",
    "it was shown that @xmath102 for the projected fermi - sea , which means that the unprojected and the effective fs coincide in that case .",
    "this suggests that the `` hole - like '' fs results from a non - trivial interplay between strong correlation and superconductivity . at the moment",
