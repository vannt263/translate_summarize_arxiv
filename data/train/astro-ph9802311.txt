    "cosmological n - body simulations have shown that the evolution of small density perturbations in an expanding universe can lead to a distribution of matter very similar to the observed large - scale structure ( see _ e.g. _ jenkins 1998 ) .",
    "purely n - body simulations have also led to an understanding of the evolution of dark matter on the scale of individual galaxies .",
    "for example , simulations of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models have shown how dark matter haloes form by the hierarchical merging of sub - units ( frenk 1988 ) , acquire angular momentum via tidal torques ( barnes and efstathiou 1987 ) , and develop radially - averaged density profiles that satisfy simple scaling relations ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) .",
    "gas - dynamical simulations of the formation of individual galaxies within dark matter haloes have been much less successful . in simulations without star formation ( navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) ,",
    "the gas component can shock and dissipate energy ( unlike the collisionless halo material ) forming thin discs within the dominant halo sub - clumps .",
    "the gas discs may be disrupted in subsequent mergers , but the efficient conversion of kinetic energy to thermal energy and rapid cooling allows the gas to settle into a new disc on a timescale that is short compared to the hubble time .",
    "the evolution thus proceeds through a hierarchy of disc formation and merging , leading , in the absence of star formation , to gaseous discs at the present day .",
    "however , during merging , angular momentum is efficiently transported outward into the halo and the resulting gaseous discs have angular momenta some two orders of magnitude below those of observed spiral galaxies ( navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) . evidently",
    ", such simulations can not account for the formation of real disc galaxies .",
    "we will sometimes refer to this problem as the ` angular momentum catastrophe ' .    on the other hand , in simulations in which efficient star formation is included , stars form within dark matter sub - clumps at early times .",
    "these largely stellar sub - units then merge as the system evolves , losing angular momentum and forming a hot spheroidal component by the present day .",
    "the final objects in such simulations are elliptical - like with no strong disc structure ( katz 1992 ) .",
    "the failure to produce realistic disc galaxies in numerical simulations contrasts with simple analytical models of disc galaxy formation .",
    "these models , first developed by fall and efstathiou ( 1980 ) and gunn ( 1982 ) , show that the sizes and collapse times of disc galaxies can be understood wihin the context of a two - component ( gas and dark matter ) theory of galaxy formation ( white and rees 1978 ) _ provided the gas component conserves its angular momentum during collapse_. more recent applications of this type of model have been developed to explain other properties of disc galaxies , _",
    "e.g. _ the slope and scatter of the tully - fisher ( 1977 ) relation ( mo , mao & white 1998 ) and the distribution of disc surface brightnesses ( dalcanton , spergel and summers 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , we will show in section 2 of this paper , that simple arguments can be developed to show that in cdm models , galactic discs can not have lost much angular momentum during collapse .",
    "there is , therefore , an apparent inconsistency with the ` angular momentum castrophe ' described above .    in this paper",
    "we suggest that this conflict might be solved if stellar feedback processes prevent discs forming until late epochs ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) .",
    "if some fraction of the protogalactic gas is prevented from collapsing until late epochs , when galactic dark matter haloes are evolving slowly and most of their substructure has been erased , then it may be possible to form discs without the angular momentum transport characteristic of merging sub - units .",
    "our aim in this paper is to test this idea using sph simulations .",
    "we review the observed angular momenta of disc galaxies in section 2 and compare them with the angular momenta of cdm haloes determined from n - body simulations .",
    "we discuss also the surface brightness distributions of disc galaxies which we relate to the large dispersion in the angular momenta of cdm haloes .",
    "the sph codes that we use , and various other numerical details such as the star formation algorithms , are described in section 3 .",
    "the generation of initial conditions for the sph simulations is described in section 4 and our main results are presented in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we review observational constraints on the angular momenta of disc galaxies and compare the results with the angular momenta of dark haloes in n - body simulations of a cdm model .",
    "we first investigate the angular momenta of haloes identified in numerical simulations of an @xmath5 scale invariant cdm model .",
    "there have been many previous investigations of this problem , including barnes and efstathiou ( 1987 ) , frenk ( 1988 ) , zurek , quinn and salmon ( 1988 ) , and more recently by lemson and kauffmann ( 1997 ) .",
    "the results described here are based on the simulation that is used to generate the initial conditions of the high resolution sph simulations described in the main part of this paper .",
    "the numerical simulation used here is run ( d ) of the ensemble described by efstathiou ( 1995 ) .",
    "the simulation is of a spatially flat @xmath5 cdm model with scale - free gaussian initial conditions generated from the power spectrum given by equation ( 7 ) of efstathiou , bond & white ( 1992 ) with @xmath6 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the cosmological density parameter . ] .",
    "we assume @xmath9 in the rest of this paper , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "the simulation contains @xmath10 particles within a cubical volume of box - length @xmath11 mpc , with the spectrum normalized so that the rms mass fluctuations in spheres of radius @xmath12 is @xmath13 at the present day .",
    "this normalization approximately matches that inferred from the abundances of rich clusters of galaxies in an @xmath5 universe ( white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ; eke , cole & frenk 1996 ) .",
    "the mass per particle in the simulation is @xmath14 .",
    "haloes are identified by linking together particles separated by @xmath15 times the mean interparticle separation using the percolation algorithm described by davis ( 1985 ) .",
    "the mean overdensity of these haloes is @xmath16 , corresponding roughly to the critical overdensity defining the virialized region of a collapsed uniform sphere . for each halo , we compute the angular momentum @xmath17 , mass @xmath18 , total energy @xmath19 and circular speed @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mass contained within a sphere of radius @xmath23 centred at the centre of mass of the halo .",

    "this type of diagram is more instructive than the usual plot showing specific angular momentum against either halo or disc mass ( fall 1983 , navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) , because the circular speed of a collapsed , centrifugally supported disc is likely to be closely similar ( to within 50% ) of the halo circular speeds ( see section  [ sec : sims ] , and mo 1998 ) . with a diagram such as fig .",
    "[ fig3.1 ] , the circular speeds measured for real disc systems can be used as indicators of the circular speeds , and typical specific angular momenta , of the haloes in which they formed .",

    "etc_. if we assume that the halo density profile truncates at @xmath33 , we can compute the specific angular momentum from the spin parameter @xmath26 @xmath34 where we have chosen @xmath35 , since this is approximately the median value of @xmath26 measured for haloes in cdm models ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ) .",

    "[ fig3.1 ] shows the specific angular momenta for a large sample of disc galaxies plotted against their circular speeds .",

    "these authors have analysed i - band ccd images of galaxies from the mathewson , ford & buchhorn ( 1992 ) sample , using a two - dimensional profile fitting algorithm described by byun & freeman ( 1995 ) .",
    "each image has been decomposed into @xmath38-law bulge and exponential disc components , providing estimates of the exponential disc scale length @xmath39 , central surface brightness @xmath40 , bulge - to - disc ratio b / d , inclination angle and i - band apparent magnitude .",
    "we use estimates of the circular speeds @xmath20 given in mathewson ( 1992 ) , corrected for inclination , to compute the specific angular momenta for a centrifugally supported exponential disc with a flat rotation curve .",
    "@xmath41 we assume @xmath42 to compute distances and include only galaxies with distances @xmath43 mpc and bulge - to - disc ratios @xmath44 , to reduce errors arising from inaccurate distances and poorly determined disc profile parameters .",
    "these selection criteria reduce the number of galaxies from @xmath45 in byun & freeman s sample to @xmath46 .",

    "[ fig3.1]c shows equation  [ ge5 ] with @xmath28 ( as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3.1]a ) .",
    "this line lies about three times higher than the median defined by the data points .",
    "this is encouraging because it shows that the angular momentum of a typical disc galaxy is similar to the angular momentum within the virialized region of a present day cdm halo of similar circular speed .",
    "2.8 truein    fig .",
    "[ fig3.1 ] also shows that the scatter in the specific angular momenta of real disc galaxies is comparable to the scatter of the specific angular momenta measured for n - body haloes .",
    "this can be demonstrated using the following simple argument ( efstathiou & barnes 1984 ) .",
    "assume that a fraction @xmath47 of the baryonic mass within the virial radius of a halo collapses to form a disc .",
    "the luminosity of the disc is @xmath48 where the expression for @xmath49 has been substituted assuming that @xmath5 and @xmath28 .",
    "the proportionality expresses the tight tully - fisher ( 1977 ) correlation between luminosity and circular speed observed for real disc systems .",
    "evidently , the ( uncertain ) cooling and feedback processes which determine @xmath47 must be tightly correlated with circular speed to reproduce the tully - fisher relation .",
    "the correlation between disc luminosity and circular speed for the byun - freeman sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3.2]a .",
    "a least squares fit to the data points gives an exponent @xmath50 .",
    "if we equate the specific angular momentum of the disc to @xmath51 as given by equation  [ ge5 ] at fixed @xmath20 , then the collapse factor of the disc is related to the spin parameter of the halo according to @xmath52 ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ) .",
    "if the gas conserves its angular momentum during collapse , then a disc that forms in a halo with a low value of @xmath26 will collapse by a large factor so ending up with a high mean surface mass density ; likewise a disc that forms in a halo with a high value of @xmath26 will end up with a low mean surface mass density .",
    "the large scatter in @xmath26 from tidal torques should therefore be reflected in the spread of surface mass densities and surface brightnesses of disc systems .",
    "the disc luminosity of an exponential disc is related to the central surface brightness , @xmath40 , according to @xmath53 , thus from equations  [ ge7 ] and ( [ ge8 ] ) , @xmath54    fig .",
    "[ fig3.2]b shows the distribution of @xmath55 for the byun - freeman sample , compared to the distribution of @xmath56 for haloes in the n - body simulations .",
    "the mean of the @xmath56 distribution has been adjusted to match the mean of the observational data points . the observed distribution plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3.2]b peaks at about @xmath57 and has a broad distribution comparable to , but not quite as broad as the distribution of @xmath56 .",
    "it is easy to think of reasons why the observed distribution might be artificially narrow , for example , the byun - freeman sample could be incomplete at low and high surface brightness , and perhaps some objects with large collapse factors produce spheroidal systems .",
    "indeed there is a large literature on observational selection effects and the surface brightness distributions of galaxies ( disney 1976 ; allen & shu 1979 ; phillipps & disney 1986 , dalcanton , spergel and summers 1997 ) .",
    "qualitatively , however , the above comparisons show that the mean angular momenta of disc systems , and their scatter , fit well with a picture in which disc galaxies form at recent epochs by the collapse of extended gaseous atmospheres within dark haloes .",
    "[ fig3.2]b suggests that disc galaxies form within dark haloes with a wide range of @xmath26 values , that the angular momentum of the halo is not a critical factor in determining whether a disc system forms . within this picture , however , the angular momentum of the disc component must be approximately conserved during collapse .    in the following sections",
    ", we will investigate this picture numerically in some detail , showing that cooling and feedback processes are crucial in determining the angular momentum of the disc component , as well as in determining the fraction of the baryonic gas that can cool .",
    "our cosmological simulations were performed using two different self - consistent , 3-dimensional , n - body codes , treesph ( hernquist & katz 1989 ) and grapesph ( steinmetz 1996 ) .",
    "these codes are capable of evolving systems containing both collisionless material ( stars and dark matter ) and gas .    smoothed particle hydrodynamics , in which gas is partitioned into fluid elements , is used to model hydrodynamical interactions between gas particles ( lucy 1977 , gingold & monaghan 1977 ) .",
    "the self - gravitating fluid elements are represented as particles that evolve according to lagrangian hydrodynamic conservation laws which take into account local effects arising from pressure gradients and viscosity .",
    "the equation of state is that for an ideal gas , @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the gas density , and @xmath61 is the specific thermal energy . as shocks can arise in the gas , an artificial viscosity is required to maintain numerical stability .",
    "the form of artificial viscosity used in both codes is similar to that used by navarro & steinmetz ( 1997 ) , _ i.e. _ modified by the curl of the velocity field to reduce the shear component .",
    "radiative cooling and star formation are included in the codes .",
    "the primordial gas is assumed to have a hydrogen fraction of @xmath62 and a helium fraction of @xmath63 by weight .",
    "cooling is computed using the ionization , recombination , and cooling rates from black ( 1981 , table 3 ) with the modifications suggested by cen ( 1992 ) for temperatures @xmath64 .",
    "radiative cooling does not proceed below a minimum temperature @xmath65k .",
    "the star formation is implemented differently in the two codes and will be described in sections 3.1 and 3.2 .",
    "treesph computes gravitational forces between particles using a hierarchical tree algorithm that groups distant particles into nested cells .",
    "the potentials of the cells are then approximated with a multipole series truncated at the quadrupole . when computing the force on a particle , treesph calculates the ratio of the current cell size to the distance between the cell and the particle . for values",
    "@xmath66 , a specified tolerance parameter , the force from the cell is treated as a whole ; otherwise , the next cellular subdivision is considered .",
    "a spline kernel is used to soften the gravitational potential in order to reduce two - body relaxation .    in treesph , individual smoothing lengths , @xmath67 ,",
    "are calculated for each gas particle and updated to ensure that @xmath68 neighbours are contained within a sphere of radius @xmath69 .",
    "in addition to individual smoothing lengths , individual timesteps are permitted for each particle .",
    "the largest time step for these treesph simulations is @xmath70 years ; the smallest number of timesteps in which a particle can reach @xmath28 is @xmath71 .",
    "smaller timesteps are chosen for particles in dense regions , using the criterion @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the acceleration and velocity of the particle , and @xmath75 determines the fractional accuracy of the integrations .",
    "@xmath76 is the maximum of the mean specific kinetic energy and one sixth of the mean specific potential energy of the system ( ewell 1988 ) .",
    "particles in the highest density areas are allowed to reduce their timesteps by up to a factor of eight .",
    "thermal energy is computed from @xmath77-\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\rho_i}\\\\      \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the first term is due to adiabatic processes , the second term accounts for the viscosity , and the third term includes the remaining nonadiabatic radiative cooling .",
    "@xmath78 is the sph smoothing kernel , which is implemented in the gather - scatter formulation of hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) .",
    "a semi - implicit method of integrating the energy equation is employed .",
    "an explicit integration using a timestep that is half of the shortest sph particle timestep is performed on the adiabatic terms whereas an implicit integration is performed on the nonadiabatic thermal heating and cooling processes . in high density regions ,",
    "the cooling time step can become so short that it is computationally impractical to employ it .",
    "thus , in order to avoid numerical errors in the integration of the thermal energy , the cooling rate is damped so that a particle can lose no more than half its thermal energy during a cooling time step ( katz & gunn 1991 ) .",
    "star formation , in which gas particles which meet the formation criteria are allowed to form a ` star ' wholly and instantaneously , has been included in treesph .",
    "the criteria for star formation are similar to those of katz ( 1992 ) .",
    "first , gas particles in collapsing regions are found , using @xmath79 as the condition for the existence of a convergent flow .",

    "the particle is locally jeans unstable if the sound crossing time is shorter than the dynamical time .",
    "each gas particle in a converging flow with @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the local sound speed , is thus a candidate for star formation .",
    "however , regions in which the gas density has decreased drastically during previous star formation will not contract as readily as physically expected due to gravitational softening . because gas particles in these high star formation regions will otherwise be prevented from forming stars through inability to meet the jeans instability criterion , that criterion is not applied to gas in softened regions with @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a constant derived from a calculation of the jeans mass ( katz 1992 ) ,",
    "@xmath84 is the softening length , @xmath85 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , @xmath86 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the gas temperature and density .",
    "third , if the cooling time , @xmath89 , is shorter than the local dynamical time , @xmath90 , then gas pressure will not inhibit the collapse of the gas particle and it may form a star . however , because radiative cooling is cut off at @xmath65k , gas particles at low temperatures have long cooling times . in order to avoid an artificial cessation of star formation in low temperature regions , gas particles with @xmath91k which otherwise meet the criteria are allowed to form stars with a cooling time set to the dynamical time @xmath92 .",
    "the local rate of star formation is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a dimensionless star formation parameter .",
    "the probability that a gas particle will form a star in time @xmath95 is @xmath96 a random number is generated for each star candidate ; if it is less than @xmath97 , the gas particle loses its sph characteristics and becomes a collisionless star particle .    for these cosmological simulations",
    ", treesph evolves the haloes from the initial redshift to @xmath28 using physical coordinates with isolated boundary conditions .",
    "the version of grapesph we employ has evolved from the treesph code of navarro & white ( 1993 ; hereafter nw ) . rather than using the mutual nearest - neighbour binary tree ( benz 1990 ) of the original implementation in order to calculate gravitational forces and find neighbours for the sph force evaluation , the special - purpose grape-3af hardware ( sugimoto 1990 ) has been harnessed to perform these tasks .",
    "this machine carries out a parallelised direct summation over all particles and very rapidly returns the forces and neighbour lists .",
    "all hydrodynamical forces are then calculated on the host workstation .",
    "the adaptations which convert a treesph code into a grapesph code have been described in detail by steinmetz ( 1996 ) .",
    "both individual timesteps and individual gas particle smoothing lengths were used . as the grape only returns `",
    "gather ' neighbours , that is those within distance @xmath67 of gas particle @xmath98 , the neighbour search radius is taken to be @xmath99 times the smoothing length .",
    "this should ensure that the actual number of mutual neighbours , which satisfy @xmath100 twice the particle separation , lies within the range @xmath101 .",
    "the gravitational forces are calculated assuming a plummer softening law . for each particle ,",
    "the total acceleration due to gravity is found in two steps .",
    "first , the acceleration arising from all gas particles is found , and then that resulting from dark matter and stars is incremented . a different gravitational softening parameter is used in these two separate force evaluations .",
    "a simplified version of the star formation algorithm described by nw was adopted .",
    "any gas particle in a sufficiently high density , collapsing region is considered to be a potential star - forming particle .",
    "these two constraints can be expressed as @xmath102 and @xmath103 the local dynamical time is then defined by @xmath104 if conditions ( [ star1 ] ) and ( [ star2 ] ) remain satisfied for the ensuing dynamical time then the gas particle converts entirely to a star particle .",
    "should either of these constraints be violated during this probationary period then the gas particle is no longer considered to be star - forming and it remains gaseous .",
    "the softening of the gravitational interaction between two particles differs in the two codes . in grapesph ,",
    "the potential is of the form corresponding to a plummer density profile , @xmath105 .",
    "however , the acceleration calculated using a plummer model softening converges to the kepler value relatively slowly .",
    "in codes like treesph , in which distant particles are assigned to cells and their potentials are represented by quadrupole expansions , the cells are assumed to be point - like rather than extended .",
    "thus , a softening in which the acceleration quickly converges to the kepler form is advantageous . in treesph",
    ", the gravitational potential is softened using the spherically symmetric spline kernel suggested by monaghan & lattanzio ( 1985 ) because it has compact support and is identical to the kepler form for @xmath106 . for the effective softening to be similar in both codes , the treesph softening lengths must have values approximately twice those of the grapesph softening lengths .",
    "the star formation algorithms employed within the two codes derive from katz ( 1992 ) and nw .",
    "they are similar in requiring that a gas particle be able to form a star only if it is in a converging flow .",
    "however , other criteria differ .",
    "this version of grapesph , unlike treesph and nw , does not use the jeans instability criterion for creating star particles nor does it define a star formation rate . like nw , grapesph defines a critical density , above which the cooling time is less than the dynamical time .",
    "the two grapesph criteria are applied to each particle when it is advanced .",
    "the criteria are monitored over the dynamical time for each ` successful ' gas particle after which , if they are not violated , a star is formed . in general , the delay is @xmath107 years . in treesph ,",
    "the criteria are checked at each system timestep of @xmath70 years ; a random number of gas particles which meet the star - forming criteria are chosen to form stars immediately .",
    "the effect of these differences is that the grapesph simulations produce more stars between @xmath37 and @xmath108 while , afterwards , the star formation rate in the treesph simulations is higher .",
    "by @xmath28 , the number of grapesph stars is some @xmath109 of the number of treesph stars .",
    "this difference is due to the additional treesph formation criteria which allow stars to continue to form in regions of high star formation where the gas density has decreased due to the transformation of gas particles to stellar particles .",
    "qualitatively , the grapesph criteria act to mimic larger supernova feedback effects in regions of high star formation .",
    "the initial conditions for our simulations are generated using a nested hierarchy algorithm similar to that described by katz & white ( 1993 ) .",
    "the idea is to select haloes from the dissipationless cdm simulation described in section  [ sec : obs ] , and then to re - simulate them at higher mass resolution using the sph codes of the previous section .",
    "this technique has been used by navarro , frenk & white ( 1995b ) and eke , navarro & frenk ( 1998 ) , in sph simulations of clusters of galaxies and by navarro & benz ( 1991 ) , quinn , katz & efstathiou ( 1996 ) , navarro & steinmetz ( 1997 ) and others in sph simulations of galaxy formation .",

    "[ fig16 ] suggests that the star formation rates in our simulations are probably too high at early times . in the simple cooling scheme adopted in our models , a reservoir of high density gas builds up in the central regions of the haloes that cools within a dynamical time and forms stars once cooling is switched on .",

    "this is compatible both with simple analytical models of disc evolution ( mo 1998 ) and with the conclusions in favour of late disc formation presented in this paper .",
    "the purpose of this study has been to investigate whether disc galaxies can form in a cdm universe with angular momenta and sizes similar to those of real disc systems .",
    "we have computed the specific angular momenta of cdm haloes from an n - body simulation and compared them with estimates for a large sample of disc galaxies .",
    "this comparison shows that disc galaxies have very nearly the same specific angular momenta as those within the virialized region of cdm haloes at @xmath194 .",
    "we therefore conclude that in a cdm - like model , the gas that formed the disc component must have collapsed at recent epochs , very nearly conserving its angular momentum during collapse .",
    "this picture is capable of explaining the present day sizes and distribution of surface brightnesses of disc galaxies ( see also dalcanton 1997 , and mo 1998 ) .",
    "however , numerical simulations of disc formation have shown that the gas experiences an ` angular momentum catastrophe ' if it is allowed to collapse early ( navarro & benz , 1991 ; navarro , frenk & white , 1995a ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) .",
    "in the absence of feedback processes , the gas collapses into subunits at high redshift , which subsequently merge losing most of their angular momentum to the dark halo material .",
    "the specific angular momenta of the resulting gaseous discs are typically two orders of magnitude smaller than those of real disc galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we have tested whether the ` angular momentum catastrophe ' can be avoided if feedback processes prevent the gas from collapsing until late epochs when haloes are reasonably smooth and slowly evolving .",
    "if this can be achieved , it may be possible for the gas to conserve most of its angular momentum during disc formation , as assumed in the simple analytical models of fall and efstathiou ( 1980 ) and others .",

    "we have generated higher resolution multi - mass initial conditions of these haloes which we have evolved with two sph codes , treesph and grapesph , that include star formation .",
    "the results from the two codes are generally in good agreement .",
    "most of the differences are caused by the larger softening length of the stellar component of the grapesph code which affects the internal structure of the collapsed objects and their susceptibility to disruption by mergers . in one pair of simulations ( runs 11 and 12 )",
    "the final stellar system has a different morphological appearance in the two codes , appearing disc - like in treesph and spheroidal in grapesph .",
    "however , in all other simulations , the morphologies of the final stellar systems are qualitatively similar in the two codes .",
    "all of the runs with cooling suppressed until @xmath1 produced spheroidal systems with final specific angular momenta of between one and two orders of magnitude lower than their dark matter haloes .",
    "these systems experience the ` angular momentum catastrophe ' seen in previous simulations .",
    "however , in the simulations with cooling suppressed until @xmath2 , stellar discs can form with specific angular momenta similar to those of real disc galaxies .",
    "this occurs in three out of five haloes simulated with treesph and two out of five simulated with grapesph .",
    "suppressing disc formation until late epochs can therefore solve the ` angular momentum catastrophe ' in some cases , but does not guarantee that a disc will survive to the present day .",
    "the morphology of the final stellar object in the simulations depends sensitively on the merging history of the parent halo .",
    "all of the haloes that we have simulated have been chosen so that they do not merge with a comparable mass system at @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , haloes 1 and 4 , approximately double their mass between @xmath37 and @xmath28 through a succession of mergers and do not maintain stellar discs to the present day .",
    "haloes @xmath4 and @xmath162 grow least between @xmath37 and @xmath28 ( see table 1 ) and these produce the most convincing stellar discs in our simulations .",
    "our simulations have demonstrated that angular momentum evolution during galaxy formation is extremely sensitive to the thermal history of the gas .",
    "this suggests that feedback processes can solve the ` angular momentum catastrophe ' and are a necessary ingredient in disc galaxy formation .",
    "the structure of dark matter haloes is also important in determining the angular momentum evolution .",
    "in fact , a number of authors ( katz & gunn , 1991 , vedel , 1994 , steinmetz & muller , 1995 , contardo , steinmetz and fritze - von alvensleben 1998 ) have shown that gas approximately conserves its angular momentum if it collapses within nearly uniform dark matter haloes that grow by monolithic collapse rather than hierarchical merging .",
    "this is not a realistic solution , however , within the context of cdm - like theories .",
    "the detailed evolution of dark matter haloes in cdm models will depend on the cosmology and spectrum of fluctuations and these may be important in determining the fraction of disc galaxies at the present day . to address this issue in an unbiased fashion would require a random choice of haloes to be resimulated , unlike that adopted here .",
    "our simulations suggest that the disc components of galaxies formed at recent epochs , perhaps as late as @xmath3 .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with recent observations showing that discs are evolving significantly over this redshift range ( mao 1998 ) .",

    "<S> strong outward transport of angular momentum has led to the formation of disc - like systems with much smaller angular momenta than observed in real disc galaxies . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate whether this problem can be circumvented if feedback processes prevent disc formation until late epochs . in some of our models , </S>",
    "<S> the gas is evolved adiabatically until a specified redshift @xmath0 , at which point the gas is allowed to cool radiatively and star formation may begin . in other models , cooling is continuous throughout the evolution but suppressed by a factor chosen to allow a discs to grow roughly linearly with time . </S>",
    "<S> the results of varying the cooling epoch for each of five different haloes are analysed . </S>",
    "<S> when cooling and star formation are initiated at redshift @xmath1 , stellar discs are destroyed during merger events and we observe similar catastrophic transport of angular momentum as seen in previous work . with cooling suppressed until @xmath2 , discs can form by the present day with angular momenta comparable to those of observed disc galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that feedback processes , which prevent gas from collapsing until late epochs , are an essential ingredient in disc galaxy formation . </S>"
