    "this discovery fed excitement in the charmonium spectroscopy because of unconventional properties of the state .",
    "x(3872 ) could not be explained through ordinary meson(@xmath23 ) and baryon ( qqq ) scheme .",
    "the conventional theories predicts complicated color neutral structures and search of such exotic structures are as old as quark model @xcite . after the discovery of x(3872 ) , the large number of charge , neutral and vector states have been detected in various experiments , famous as the xyz states .",

    "the sub structure of the all these states are still a open question , they might driven exotic structure like tetraquark , molecular or hybrid , expected as per theory of qcd , needs theoretical attention . + in the present study , we focus on the molecular structure , as meson - antimeson bound state , just like deuteron .",
    "the multiquark structures have been studied since long time @xcite .",
    "t@xmath33rnqvist , in @xcite predicted mesonic molecular structures , introduced as @xmath34 by using one pion exchange potential . with heavy flavour mesons , various authors predicted the bound state of @xmath0 and @xmath12 as a possible mesonic molecular structures as well as studied the possibilities of the @xmath4 and @xmath15 as vector - vector molecule @xcite , also it have been studied in various theoretical approaches like potential model @xcite , effective field theory @xcite , local hidden gauge approach @xcite etc .. + in the variational scheme , we have used the potential model approach to study the meson - antimeson bound system . for that",
    ", we have used the hellmann potential @xcite ( superposition of the coulomb + yukawa potential ) with one pion exchange potential ( opep ) .",
    "we assume that the colour neutral states experience residual force due to confined gluon exchange between quarks of the hadrons ( generally known as residual strong force ) , skyrme - like interaction . as mentioned by greenberg in ref .",
    "@xcite and also noted by shimizu in ref @xcite that this dispersive force ( also called london force ) or the attraction between colour singlet hadron comes from the virtual excitation of the colour octet dipole state of each hadron @xcite .",
    "indeed , long ago skyrme @xcite in 1959 and then guichon @xcite , in 2004 had remarked that the nucleon internal structure to the nuclear medium does play a crucial role in such strong effective force of the n - n interaction . in the study of the s - wave n - n scattering phase shift , in ref.@xcite , khadkikar and vijayakumar used the colour magnetic part of the fermi - breit unconfined one - gluon - exchange potential responsible for short range repulsion and sigma and pion are used for bulk n - n attraction . in this way , with such assumption of the interaction , the mass spectra of the dimesonic bound states are calculated . + for molecular binding , the ref.@xcite found that the quark exchange alone could not bind the system , led to include one pion exchange .",
    "the ref.@xcite mention some additional potential strength required with one pion exchange . whereas , the dynamics at very short distance led to complicated heavy boson exchange models as studied in @xcite . in all these studies",
    "@xcite , one common conclusion was extracted that the highly sensitive dependence of the results on the regularisation parameter . to avoid these dependency and complicated heavy boson exchange in this phenomenological study , we used the hellmann potential in accordance to delicate calculation of attraction and repulsion at short distance .",
    "the overall hellmann potential represents the residual strong interaction at short distance in flavour of the virtual excitation of the colour octet dipole state of each colour neutral states .",
    "the opep is included for long range behaviour of the strong force .",
    "the ope potential could be split into two parts ( i ) central term with sipn - isospin factor ( ii ) tensor part .",
    "we have analyse the effect of these two parts . by calculating the spin - isospin factor as in @xcite",
    ", we have found the symmetry braking in our results which was also discussed by t@xmath33rnqvist in @xcite , whereas , the tensor term to be found play a very crucial role implicit the necessity of it . in that way ,",
    "bound state of @xmath0 is compared with the state x(3872 ) which also have been predicted as mesonic molecule by the authors of ref.@xcite whereas states @xmath24 and @xmath24 which are close to the @xmath12 and @xmath15 threshold .",
    "+ to test the internal structure of the state , in general , one have to look for the decay pattern of the state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hadronic decays of the x(3872 ) have been studied in accordance to its decay mode sensitive to the short or long distance structure of the state . to test the compared states as dimesonic system ,",
    "we have used the binding energy as input for decay calculation .",

    "we have used formula of @xcite for radiative decay for predicated states . with calculated binding energy ,",
    "the decay properties are in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "+ the article is organize as follows , after the brief introduction we have discussed the hellmann potential and ope potential in sec - ii then in sec - iii we presents our theoretical approach for the calculation of the mass spectra as well as for decay width , in sec - iv we present our results for deuteron as per our model and generalize our approach . in sec - v and",
    "vi we presents our results of dimesonic states and finally we summarise our present work .",
    "two color neutral states formed the bound states , just like deuteron is the bound state of proton and neutron . in the case of the dimesonic states ,",
    "the meson and antimeson are takeover as a constituents , forming a bound state .",
    "the interaction potential between two color neutral constituents taken as a phenomenological hellmann potential @xcite with one pion exchange potential(opep ) @xcite .",
    "the colour neutral states experience residual force due to confined gluon exchange between quarks of the hadrons .",
    "the attraction between colour singlet hadron comes from the virtual excitation of the colour octet dipole state of each hadron .",
    "when two colour neutral states are come enough close to each other so the quark of the one colour neutral states can feel to quark of the other state creates manifestation of the energy .",
    "once the interaction become strong enough then this manifestation of the energy being the source for the creation for the quark anti quark pair .",
    "this residual force is analogous to the residual interaction between two electrical neutral atoms , experienced the van der waals force .",
    "the overall hellmann potential represents the residual strong interaction at short distance , where , these pseudopotential has the form , namely    @xmath37    here , the constant @xmath38 is the residual strength of the strong running coupling constant between the two colour neutral states and b are the strength of the yukawa potential whereas @xmath39 is the relative separation between constituents .",
    "the value of the @xmath38 could be determined through the model , such as    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constituent masses , m=2@xmath41 @xmath42/(@xmath41+@xmath42 ) , @xmath43=1 gev , @xmath44=0.250 gev and @xmath45 is number of flavour @xcite .",
    "so , the coulomb interaction is constrained by the value of @xmath38 .",
    "the constant b and c appeared in the yukawa potential of eq.(1 ) play very trivial role on overall characteristic of the hellmann potential . in the fig(3 ) ( see appendix - a ) , one can observe that once the coulombic interaction is fixed , the variation of the constant b and c are inversely proportional to each other . as the value of the b increases , it increases the repulsive nature of the potential while the constant c smoothing the curve as well as it increases the strength of the yukawa part - inversely to b. to show such nature of the hellmann potential , in the fig(3 ) , the graph have been plotted for various set of values of the b and c. for the bound state , the value of b can take both positive and negative values . with the negative values of the b",
    "the overall potential become attractive . for more detailed discussion on the hellmann potential , we suggest to the readers for ref.@xcite . in our case of the dimesonic bound states calculations ,",
    "we assume that the hellmann potential at very short distance cares for the delicate cancellation of attraction and repulsion respectively which is mainly taken care by heavy boson exchange in the one boson exchange model .",
    "+ whereas , the long range behaviour of the interaction part is accomplished by one pion exchange .",
    "the model carried the net potential as the hellmann potential plus ope potential plus relativistic correction .",
    "we introduced and discussed the relativistic correction after this section .",
    "for instance , to fix the model ( or the potential ) for deuteron which is widely believed to be have molecular structure and well studied in obe potential model , we fit the values of the constant @xmath46 and @xmath47 to get approximate binding energy of deuteron .",
    "then , to generalize the model to dimesonic system , we arrive on the relation between b and c in accordance of the mass of the system , + if @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the threshold mass of dimesonic state and @xmath41 mass of deuteron and n is integer number ( n=1,2,3 .. ) , then @xmath50 here , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the constant , fitted for deuteron binding energy .",

    "the expression of opep in the eq.(4 ) is for the point like pion . while , in a more realistic picture where the pion itself has its own internal structure , it is natural to introduced the usual form factor due to the dressing of the quarks . by introducing this finite size effect @xcite",
