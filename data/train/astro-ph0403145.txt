    "m83 ( ngc 5236 ) is a nearby face - on barred spiral galaxy with a double nucleus and a nuclear starburst ( @xmath4 mpc , @xmath5 pc ; thim et al .",
    "the galaxy is exceptionally complex in the central 300 pc , despite the symmetric appearance of its bar and spiral arms . in @xmath2 band , the brightest point , called the ` visible nucleus ' ,",
    "is offset by 34 ( 75 pc ) from the centroid ( i.e. , center of symmetry ) determined from the isophotes at radii of 0.3  0.7 kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ttg ) .",
    "the centroid suffers from large extinction , and does not show a peak in @xmath2 band .",
    "however , the stellar velocity dispersion peaks both at the visible nucleus and near the isophotal centroid , and suggests a mass of @xmath110@xmath6  for each .",
    "this suggests a double nucleus ( ttg ) .",
    "the visible nucleus has a hard power - law spectrum in x - ray due either to an accreting supermassive black hole or to x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a double circumnuclear ring in their @xmath7 color index map .",
    "the ` inner ' and ` outer ' rings of 190 pc and 60 pc radius are not concentric .",
    "the galaxy hosts a circumnuclear starburst mainly in the ` starburst arc ' of @xmath1250 pc length that lies between the two rings @xcite .",
    "the galactic center has a large amount of molecular gas , estimated to be @xmath8 in @xmath9 pc @xcite .",
    "the proximity , face - on configuration , abundant molecular gas , starburst , and double nucleus make m83 one of the most interesting targets to study spiral galaxies and their nuclear activity through molecular gas .",
    "we observed m83 as a part of the early science program of the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "the new telescope in hawaii can easily observe the galaxy at @xmath10 . in this _",
    ", we first describe the observations and the bar - driven gas dynamics in the central 2 kpc , and then show that the visible nucleus is indeed offset from the dynamical center of m83 and has a velocity feature indicative of its own gas disk .",
    "we discuss the origin of the double nucleus , and its relation to the starburst activity .",
    "m83 was observed with the sma @xcite from february through may 2003 during the commissioning of the array .",
    "we observed co(@xmath0=21 ) and co(@xmath0=32 ) lines in the galactic center with a total on - source time of 14 hr and 10 hr , respectively .",
    "five of the eight sma antennas were available , except for the first 230 ghz observations which had only four antennas .",
    "a partial reconfiguration of the array during our observing period gave us 14 independent baselines for each band .",
    "zenith opacity was between 0.03 and 0.15 at 225 ghz during our observations , and dsb system temperatures toward the galaxy were typically 150 k at 1.3 mm and 500 k at 0.85 mm . the correlator bandwidth and resolution were 640 mhz and 0.8125 mhz , respectively .",
    "the co(21 ) observations were the first mosaic imaging with the sma .",
    "three positions separated by 25  from each other along the bar were cycled through every 10 minutes .",
    "we calibrated the system gain every @xmath130 minutes by observing a pair of nearby quasars , j1337129 and j1313333 at 1.3 mm and j1337129 and 3c279 at 0.85 mm .",
    "interferometric pointing was made during the observations toward the gain calibrators to keep pointing errors @xmath11 .",
    "the passband was calibrated using jupiter or saturn , and the flux scale using uranus .",
    "the primary calibrator j1337129 dimmed by @xmath130 % in 1.3 mm in our observing period of 76 days .",
    "calibration of the raw data was made using mir , and the imaging and data analysis were made with miriad and aips .",
    "channel maps were made every 10  and then combined to make moment maps .",
    "no continuum was detected from channels free of line emission , with 5 @xmath12 upper limits of 50 and 150 mjy for 1.3 mm and 0.85 mm , respectively .",
    "our interferometric maps recovered 90 % and 3050 % of the total flux at the galactic center in co(21 ) and co(32 ) , respectively , based on a comparison with single - dish observations @xcite .",
    "the co(21 ) and co(32 ) integrated intensity maps ( figure [ fig.mom0 ] ) reveal two gas ridges at the leading side of the stellar bar ( p.a .",
    "@xmath150 ) , and a nuclear gas ring of @xmath1300 pc diameter .",
    "there are additional features inside the ring , which we discuss in  [ s.nucleus ] .",
    "the overall morphology of molecular gas agrees well with that in the @xmath7 ( @xmath13 extinction ) image of elmegreen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; for example , the @xmath1300 pc nuclear ring is their outer ring .",
    "the pair of ridges and the nuclear ring must be due to the two types of oval orbits in the bar .",
    "namely , the former must be on the  orbits , which are the dominant type of orbits in a bar and are elongated along the bar , while the latter must be on the  orbits , which are seen near the center of a bar and are elongated perpendicular to the bar @xcite .",
    "the presence of two major kinematical components is evident in the position - velocity diagram of the co(21 ) emission , fig .",
    "[ fig.pv](a ) .",
    "one component that runs throughout our field of view with slow rotation is from the gas ridges , while the other with faster rotation near the center is from around the nuclear ring ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "our viewing angle of m83 , from which the line of nodes coincides with the bar , makes gas on   orbits appear slower and  gas appear faster .",
    "besides the ridges and the nuclear ring , there is faint emission between them in the co(21 ) map fig . [",
    "fig.mom0](a ) .",
    "this weak emission and part of the gas ridges form a parallelogram .",
    "the morphology and location of this component suggest that it is on oval orbits whose major axes are neither perpendicular nor parallel to the bar but in - between .",
    "indeed , it is theoretically expected that gaseous orbits between  and -dominated regions continuously change their major axes from parallel to the bar to perpendicular to the bar as the orbital radius decreases @xcite .",
    "in addition , gas funneled in the bar through one of the gas ridges on  orbits can eventually collide with gas in the nuclear ring on  orbits , and can be ` sprayed back ' onto the other ridge to form a parallelogram @xcite .",
    "we established kinematically the offset of the visible nucleus from the dynamical center in the following way .",
    "the systemic velocity of the galaxy was first determined to be @xmath15  ( ) from the co(21 ) mean velocity data ( figure [ fig.mom1 ] ) by searching for the velocity whose contour is least biased toward either blue- and red - shifted direction .",
    "the velocity map was not fitted to derive the systemic velocity because the emission covered only a small area and there is noncircular motion due to the bar , the contour for the systemic velocity has an angle of @xmath175  rather than 90  to this major axis .",
    "noncircular motion in the bar is probably most responsible for this , though warp of the disk could be partly responsible . ] and to the visible nucleus as discussed below .",
    "the dynamical center should lie on the systemic - velocity contour .",
    "the @xmath2 band center determined by ttg from isophotes at radii between 12   and 30 , shown as a cross in the velocity map , is almost on that contour .",
    "thus , it is most likely that the dynamical center of m83 is on , or in the vicinity of , the isophotal centroid , as morphologically expected . on the other hand ,",
    "the visible nucleus shown as a diamond in the velocity map is clearly off the systemic - velocity contour and must be at least 3  ( 65 pc ) away from the dynamical center .",
    "we discovered high - velocity gas around the off - center , visible nucleus . in figure",
    "[ fig.pv ] , where the off - center nucleus is at @xmath16 while the isophotal centroid is at 0 , the  diagrams show a high - velocity component at around @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "there is no counterpart in the receding side ; the largest velocity at @xmath19 is @xmath20 .",
    "spatially , the component is compact and is within 2  of the off - center nucleus at the most blueshifted velocity .",
    "this compact high - velocity component is detected in both co(21 ) and co(32 ) .",
    "it shows up in the integrated intensity maps as the peak @xmath12  southeast of the visible nucleus .",
    "the large blueshift of this component is also evident in the mean velocity map ( fig .",
    "[ fig.mom1 ] ) . the position - velocity diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig.pv](b ) clearly shows that the high - velocity gas is a part of the continuous ridge of emission that has a large velocity gradient across the visible , off - center nucleus .",
    "the velocity gradient around the nucleus is roughly along the galaxy s major axis , as seen in the mean velocity map .",
    "we interpret this feature as a gas disk that rotates around the off - center nucleus but not directly around the dynamical center of m83 .",
    "the feature is unlikely to be due to streaming motion in the bar potential , though molecular gas in the center of barred galaxies often shows a large velocity gradient due to noncircular motion @xcite .",
    "this is because the feature is seen only on one side of the dynamical center and only in blueshifted velocities , and also because the visible nucleus is at the center of the feature .",
    "the feature is also unlikely to be due to an outflow .",
    "it is because both starburst and a nuclear jet , the latter of which may exist along the minor axis of the galaxy @xcite , would cause a velocity gradient along the minor axis rather than the major axis as we see here .",
    "the extent and the total width of the line - of - sight velocity of this component are 80 pc and 140 , or 120 pc and 180  if we include the peak near ( + 1 , + 10 )",
    ". the size and location of the gas disk are roughly consistent with those of the inner ring in elmegreen et al .",
    "the dynamical mass of the disk is @xmath3 within a radius of 40 pc assuming the same inclination as m83 ( 25 ) ; it would be a factor of 4 smaller if the inclination was 60 .",
    "the mass distribution in the disk is extended , and not dominated by a single compact object , because the mass within 6.5 pc of the visible nucleus was estimated to be 1.6@xmath21  ( ttg ) .",
    "what are the off - center nucleus and the gas rotating around it ?",
    "ttg concluded that the visible nucleus could not be a young star cluster , but had to be a dynamically hot nucleus , on the basis of its high velocity dispersion and stellar population .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the observation of @xcite that the mass of the individual young clusters in the nuclear region of m83 ( mostly on the starburst arc ) is less than about @xmath22 .",
    "the eccentric disk model used for the double nucleus in m31@xcite is also dismissed for m83 because , among other things , the rotation of stars and gas around the dynamical center is not keplerian .",
    "a plausible model for the visible off - center nucleus is that it is the remnant core of a small galaxy that merged into m83",
    ". the prototype major merger arp 220 has two surviving nuclei at a projected separation of @xmath1300 pc with gas disks rotating around each of them @xcite .",
    "a less violent minor merger may have produced the configuration seen here .",
    "m83 has a faint stellar arc of @xmath130 kpc length indicating the accretion of at least one satellite @xcite .",
    "if the visible nucleus came from outside , then it does not need to be on the disk plane of m83 .",
    "however , the nucleus is probably not far away from the mid - plane of m83 because ( 1 ) the chances of seeing it at the small projected distance from the dynamical center are low if the nucleus is far from the disk plane , ( 2 ) the mean velocity of gas and stars of the visible nucleus is roughly on the rotation curve of m83 , and ( 3 ) numerical simulations of satellite accretion show that a satellite rapidly looses its orbital radius after it settles on the disk of the larger galaxy , since disk stars are the main source of torque on the satellite @xcite . if the accreted nucleus has spent a long time in the galactic plane of m83 , then the gas rotating around the nucleus , presumably as a mini - disk , may not be from the original satellite but may have been captured from m83 during the accretion . regarding the large extinction toward the other nucleus at the dynamical center ( presumably the true nucleus of m83 ) ,",
    "it is conceivable that the mini - disk is slightly above the mid - plane of m83 in the direction of the hidden nucleus , effectively shielding most of the light from it even though the co integrated intensities are not particularly high toward the dynamical center .",
    "alternatively , the visible nucleus may be a part of the original nucleus of m83 that has moved away from the dynamical center of the galaxy .",
    "this would explain the lack of obvious disturbance in the m83 disk outside the nuclear ring .",
    "such a wandering nucleus may occur even without perturbation from outside the galaxy ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the starburst in m83 is lopsided , mostly on the receding side of the dynamical center .",
    "this is true not only for the starburst arc ( figure [ fig.hst ] ) but also for other sites of active star formation more obscured by dust .",
    "the latter are @xmath110  northwest of the visible nucleus , near the strongest peak of co emission , according to radio and mid - infrared observations @xcite .    the lopsided starburst may well be due to the dynamical effect of the off - center nucleus .",
    "lopsidedness ( @xmath23 mode ) is atypical in starburst morphology near the center of a barred galaxy , where bisymmetry ( i.e. , @xmath24 mode such as twin peaks , two - armed spiral , and an oval ring ) is most often observed .",
    "our observations established that the visible nucleus , be it an intruder or a wanderer , is off the dynamical center of the galaxy .",
    "the new mass estimate of this component is @xmath120 % of the dynamical mass in the central 300 pc of m83 .",
    "thus the off - center nucleus must have had a significant , both positive and negative , influence on star formation in the area through perturbations to starforming gas .",
    "it is noteworthy that both the age of the starburst and the dynamical timescale for the off - center nucleus are in the order of several myr . to summarize",
    ", the nuclear starburst of m83 owes much to the bar - driven gas dynamics for accumulating molecular gas to the central 300 pc , and appears to have taken the current shape under the strong influence of the double nucleus .",
    "we are grateful to all people who worked hard to realize the sma .",
    "we also thank p. t. p. ho and j. m. moran for helpful comments on the manuscript , n. z. scoville for providing us with the mir package before its release , and stsci for the archival hst images of m83 .",
