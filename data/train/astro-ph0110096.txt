    "among molecular clouds within 200 pc of the sun , the ophiuchus cloud offers the best opportunity to study the formation of a stellar cluster at close range . at a distance of 145 pc @xcite , it contains a high density of low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) deeply embedded in the cloud material , as evidenced by the extremely high gas and dust column densities measured there @xcite .",
    "most of the stellar content of the ophiuchus cloud is obscured at visible wavelengths .",
    "however , early infrared observations revealed a rich embedded stellar population @xcite .",
    "more recent observations using infrared arrays combined with molecular line maps have shown that these stars are concentrated in three dense molecular cores within the cloud @xcite .",
    "age estimates based on infrared spectroscopic studies indicate that the stars are very young , with ages less than 10@xmath4 yr @xcite .",
    "recent evidence suggests that most stars form in clusters @xcite , but there is relatively little theoretical guidance available to indicate how clusters develop @xcite .",
    "the hierarchical structure of some groups has been said to arise from the hierarchical nature of condensations formed by turbulent processes ( e.g. klessen et al .",
    "2000 ) , but tests of cluster formation models require better knowledge of cluster spatial structure , and its temporal development .",
    "the youngest clusters are the best regions to study for this purpose because their stars have had relatively little time to move from their formation sites , and the spatial structure of the youngest members is essentially their spatial structure at birth .    in this contribution , we present the results of an infrared imaging survey using nicmos on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the superior sensitivity and spatial resolution provided by hst were used to i ) obtain a more complete census of the young stellar population in the dense star - forming regions of the cloud , ii ) determine the degree of clustering and the binary and multiple star frequency , iii ) identify candidate brown dwarfs , and iv ) resolve the morphologies of deeply embedded extended sources .",
    "details of the observations and data analysis are described in   [ obs ] .",
    "positions and photometry of all detected sources are presented in table 2 , along with cross - correlations with other designations from the literature . in ",
    "[ resu ] , we present results on the clustering and multiplicity of our sample , and a search for new brown dwarf candidates .",
    "a detailed description of extended sources is provided in   [ fuzz ] .",
    "a list of binary and multiple systems is presented in table 3 , and new candidate brown dwarfs are noted in table 2 .",
    "these results are summarized in   [ summ ] .",
    "observations were obtained with hst / nicmos camera 3 during the june 1998 campaign .",
    "camera 3 has a pixel scale of 020 pixel@xmath5 and a field  of  view of @xmath6 .",
    "images were made through the f110w and f160w filters , with integration times of 39.95 seconds and 31.96 seconds , respectively .",
    "thirteen target positions were chosen to correspond with both high surface density of previously known ysos and high gas column density , and are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] ( see also figure 1 ) .",
    "each was observed in a @xmath7 spiral pattern with a 48   dither , resulting in 13 @xmath8 mosaics .",
    "each field was imaged twice in each filter , with a 3   offset between image pairs to aid in identification and removal of bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "uncalibrated images were processed using the iraf / stsdas package calnica , and the latest reference files provided by the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) . because camera 3 suffers from a dc offset or bias problem ( a.k.a . the `` pedestal effect '' ) ,",
    "corrections were made using a program in idl ( pedtherm ) provided by l. bergeron of stsci . in regions dominated by bright extended emission , no pedestal corrections were made .",
    "for each mosaic , a sky frame was constructed of median filtered images , using only those fields which did not contain bright extended emission .",
    "masks were constructed to prevent stars from contributing to both the pedestal and sky determinations .",
    "sky - subtracted image pairs were cross - correlated to determine spatial shifts , and combined using the iraf / stsdas package drizzle @xcite , which re - samples the image pairs onto a common pixel grid .",
    "images containing no apparent sources were combined with drizzle using the prescribed telescope dither .",
    "reduced images were flux calibrated using recently determined photometric scale factors , @xmath9 jy @xmath10 at 1.1  @xmath0 m and @xmath11 jy @xmath10 at 1.6  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "corresponding zero points were calculated on the vega system , assuming zero magnitude flux densities at 1775 and 1083 jy and effective wavelengths of 1.104  @xmath0 m and 1.593  @xmath0 m for f110w and f160w respectively @xcite .",
    "magnitudes were measured using aperture photometry routines in iraf / digiphot , and are reported in table 2 . for point sources we used an aperture of radius 05   ( 5 pixels in our drizzled images ) . a larger aperture radius of 3   was used to measure the flux from extended sources , as noted in table 2 . by adding artificial stars to our data",
    ", we estimate that our photometry is 90% complete to 21.0 mag at f160w and 21.5 mag at f110w . within those limits ,",
    "we detect 165 sources at f160w and 65 sources at f110w .",
    "a census of near - infrared surveys in the literature @xcite indicates that approximately two thirds of the sources listed in table 2 are previously unreported .",
    "enough overlap exists between our survey and previous studies that we can derive transformations between the f110w and f160w magnitudes and a standard ground - based system . comparing our photometry with that of barsony et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for 21 sources , we find the following linear relations : @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where j and h are on the cit system .",
    "these relations were used to convert our f110w and f160w magnitudes to j and h magnitudes , allowing their placement in a color - magnitude diagram ( see figure  [ fig : cm ] , discussed in   [ bd ] ) .",
    "because no guide stars were visible in the highly extincted target fields , observations were unguided , leading to some drift in the field centers ( of order a few to 20   throughout a 3x3 map ) .",
    "this drift , coupled with the fact that many frames have no or very few sources , complicated the determination of accurate astrometric solutions with these data . instead , the coordinate system of barsony et al .",
    "( 1997 ) was adopted , since that survey covers a large fraction of the cloud and has been extensively cross - correlated with previous studies .",
    "barsony et al .",
    "estimated 1@xmath14 uncertainties of 12   in their absolute positions .",
    "given the sensitivity of our survey , we can expect to detect some background stars through the molecular cloud , so some means of distinguishing cloud members from background sources would be helpful . unfortunately , with photometry in only 2 bands we can not use colors to distinguish reddened background field stars from non  nebulous pre  main sequence stars embedded within the cloud .",
    "however , we can estimate the background by considering the observed distribution of objects with respect to the column density of molecular gas , and the expected source counts in this part of the sky from a model of the galaxy .    in figure",
    "[ fig : avmap ] , we reproduce the extinction map made by wilking & lada ( 1983 ) , based on observations of c@xmath15o ( j=10 ) and @xmath16co ( j=10 ) . on it",
    "we plot the locations of all 165 sources detected at f160w .",
    "our hst mosaics are coincident with high @xmath1 regions , with the exception of some fields on the eastern sides of cores a , b , and f. these fields coincide with a steep gradient in the cloud column density , and in them large numbers of stars are seen .",
    "as the extinction increases toward the center of the cloud , the number of stars decreases .",
    "clearly , a significant fraction of detected sources on the edges of the cloud cores must be background stars .    the infrared galactic model of wainscoat et al .",
    "( 1992 ) predicts the existence of approximately 140 stars arcmin@xmath17 brighter than our detection limit in the direction of the ophiuchus cloud , assuming @xmath18 .",
    "however , when the model prediction is convolved with the @xmath1 map , the resulting background is substantially smaller .",
    "this was done by calculating the expected background for each pixel in the @xmath1 map , then summing over all pixels to obtain the total number of expected background stars as a function of h magnitude .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hlum ] we plot the observed h - band distribution of stars ( using the conversion from magnitude at f160w to magnitude at h given in section  [ phot ] ) .",
    "the distribution predicted by wainscoat s model and reddened with our @xmath1 map ( assuming @xmath19 = 0.155@xmath1 , @xcite ) is shown as a heavy dotted line .",
    "it appears that the background is small , becoming dominant only for h@xmath2020 mag . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the expected background as seen through a uniform extinction cloud of @xmath21 35 , 40 , and 45 mag .",
    "the background modelled with our extinction map agrees closely with that for a uniform extinction of 40 mag .",
    "for this reason , we shall assume that all stars lying outside the @xmath2240 mag .",
    "contour in figure  [ fig : avmap ] are background . within the 40 mag .",
    "contour , the probable number of background stars given by the wainscoat model ranges from approximately 0.50 stars arcmin@xmath17 ( for @xmath1=40 mag ) to 0.02 stars arcmin@xmath17 ( for @xmath1=80 mag ) . of the 165 sources detected in our survey ,",
    "108 sources lie within the 40 mag contour , and 58 of these are new detections , too faint to have been detected in previous surveys . in the discussions of clustering , multiplicity , and brown dwarfs which follow , only these 108 sources will be considered .",
    "ground  based imaging surveys at 2  @xmath0 m revealed that the young stars in the ophiuchus cloud are clustered in 34 main groups associated with dense cores of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "our hst survey targeted these peaks in the yso surface density distribution , allowing us to examine structure within these stellar concentrations to a greater depth and with higher resolution than before .",
    "the highest concentration of sources is in core a , where 23 stars are detected at f160w within an area @xmath23 pc in size ( 19 x 12  , centered on hst position 2 in table 1 ) .",
    "the extinction in this area is @xmath24 mag , and averages 60 mag , leading to an estimated background contribution of 0.3@xmath252 stars . the yso surface density in the area , excluding background objects , is then @xmath26 stars pc@xmath17 . assuming a range of depths from half to twice the area width",
    ", we estimate stellar volume densities of @xmath27 stars pc@xmath3 , comparable to the density of @xmath28 stars pc@xmath3 determined for the core of the orion nebula cluster ( hillenbrand & hartmann 1998 ) .",
    "other peaks in the stellar density are found in core b ( hst positions 9 and 10 ) and core e ( hst positions 12 and 13 ) .",
    "volume densities there are slightly less , ranging from @xmath29 stars pc@xmath3 .",
    "inverting the volume density yields a mean spacing between stars in the core a peak of @xmath30 pc , or @xmath31 au , and @xmath32 au in the b and e cores .",
    "this is similar to the 6000 au `` fragmentation '' scale identified by motte et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in their analysis of 1.3 mm continuum dust clumps , which are concentrated in the same three regions as the infrared sources reported here .",
    "in fact , the embedded stars in ophiuchus and the dust clumps detected at 1.3 mm have similar , but not identical , spatial distributions .",
    "the clumps show the same sub - clustering shown by the stars , as seen in figure  [ fig : space ] , where the positions of the starless clumps from motte et al .",
    "( 1998 ; open squares ) have been plotted along with the positions of the stars ( filled circles ) .",
    "interestingly , the clumps are more strongly associated with the highest extinction regions of the cloud , whereas the stars appear to cluster around the edges of these regions .",
    "this similar spatial relation of the stars and the millimeter continuum clumps in each of the three subgroups of the ophiuchus core suggests that we are observing a real effect with the same explanation ( origin ? ) in each subgroup .",
    "some of the millimeter continuum clumps could be highly extincted ysos , but this seems unlikely because most of the clumps are extended , some have associated compact molecular line emission , and the necessary extinction , @xmath33 mag , is in all other known cases accompanied by emission at far- and mid - infrared wavelengths ( cf .",
    "ladd et al .",
    "1991 ) . adopting the interpretation of motte et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that the millimeter continuum clumps are prestellar , a more likely explanation is that in each subgroup , the region of highest extinction is a `` starless core '' which has not yet formed stars , but has formed numerous protostellar condensations with relative spacing ( 4000 - 5000 au ) similar to that of the surrounding young stars . in this picture",
    ", the similar spacing of prestellar and young stellar objects suggests that the young stellar objects have neither concentrated nor dispersed significantly since their formation .",
    "this evidence for spatial segregation by age may offer important clues to how stars form in clusters .      to search for apparent binary pairs and higher - order multiple systems , we performed both a visual examination of all images and a nearest neighbor calculation for all detected sources . however in order to decrease the likelihood of mistaking background stars for companions , we restricted the sample to the 108 stars projected within the @xmath3440 mag contour of the cloud ( as discussed in ",
    "[ bground ] ) .    for relatively faint stars ( m(f160w)@xmath3518 ) ,",
    "our survey is sensitive to separations comparable to the resolution of the array ( 02 pixel@xmath5 ) , although due to the complex nicmos psf , our detection of faint companions within @xmath36   of bright stars may be incomplete . to guard against bias , we took our estimated limiting magnitude for faint companions ( m(f160w)@xmath3518 ) and imposed this limit on the sample , further restricting our sample to 62 stars .",
    "the maximum separation considered in our search was 10(1450 au ) , chosen to coincide with previous searches for pre - main sequence binaries . within the separation range of 02 to 10",
    ", we detected seven apparent binary pairs and six apparent triple systems .",
    "they are listed in table 3 , and shown in figure  [ fig : multis ] .",
    "the triple systems pictured in panels i , j , and k in figure  [ fig : multis ] , are unusual in that they appear to be non - hierarchical . the other triple systems reported here ( panels l and m ) are organized in the usual way , having a close pair with a widely separated third member .",
    "the multiplicity fraction , defined as the ratio of the number of binary and multiple systems detected , to the number of single , binary and multiple systems observed , or mf = b+m/(s+b+m ) , is then 0.30@xmath250.08 .",
    "several previous multiplicity studies have included targets in lynds 1688 , each one sensitive to a specific range of companion separations and limiting magnitudes . in the lunar occultation experiment of simon et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , observations were sensitive to stars brighter than k@xmath3711 and binary separations of 0005   to 10 .",
    "observing 35 systems , they detected 10 binaries , two triples , and one quadruple , for a multiplicity fraction of 0.37@xmath250.10 .",
    "there are important differences between simon et al .",
    "( 1995 ; hereafter s95 ) and this study which should be considered when comparing their results .",
    "first , the minimum separation detectable by s95 was 0005 , whereas ours is @xmath3702 .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the samples also differ : @xmath38 and @xmath39 in s95 and this study , respectively . for projected separations between 02   and 10   only , s95 obtain mf@xmath40 .",
    "when we compare this with our mf of @xmath41 for a deeper limiting magnitude , we conclude that the two results do not differ significantly . within the uncertainties , the multiplicity fractions of s95 and this work",
    "are in agreement .",
    "the relationship between the separation of binary pairs and clustering on a larger scale has been explored in a number of nearby star forming regions , including ophiuchus @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the mean surface density of companions ( msdc ) , which larson ( 1995 ) applied to young stars in the taurus - auriga star - forming region , finding clustering on two distinct scales . for large - scale clustering the msdc",
    "was found to have a power - law slope of @xmath42 @xmath43 , and for small separations a slope of @xmath42 @xmath44 was found .",
    "the `` break point '' between large and small scale slopes was determined to be @xmath42 @xmath45 pc .",
    "simon ( 1997 ; hereafter s97 ) computed the msdc for ophiuchus , taurus , and the trapezium , finding similar power laws for each .",
    "we computed the msdc for the 108 stars projected within the @xmath3440 mag contour of figure 2 .",
    "the result is shown in figure 6 for two samples of different depths : a shallow magnitude cutoff ( h@xmath4614 ) and a deep limiting magnitude ( h@xmath4621 ) .",
    "as seen in figure 6 , the two samples have different break points .",
    "the shallow magnitude limit was selected to approximately match that of s97 ( k@xmath4612 ) , and not surprisingly , the two msdcs have the same slopes and break points . the deeper sample shows a break point on a smaller spatial scale ( by an order of magnitude ) .",
    "thus , in a given star forming region , the properties of the msdc can vary according to the depth of the sample .",
    "bate et al . (",
    "1998 ) cautioned against overinterpreting the msdc , in part for this reason .",
    "we offer this comparison as further caution .      with completeness limits of 21.5 and 21.0 magnitudes at f110w and f160w respectively , our survey is sensitive to very low - mass objects .",
    "for example , we should have detected stars of spectral type l4 v , through as much as 17 @xmath1 , assuming @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "such very low - mass objects are relatively `` blue '' in intrinsic color , typically having @xmath49 ( kirkpatrick et al . 1999 ) , and so might be distinguishable from heavily reddened background stars in an infrared color - magnitude diagram .    using the transformations from f110w and f160w to j and h listed in ",
    "[ phot ] and the fluxes in table 2 , we converted our measured magnitudes to j and h magnitudes and plotted them in the color - magnitude diagram shown in figure  [ fig : cm ] .",
    "also plotted are the @xmath50 yr isochrone and the zams from the pre - main sequence stellar evolution models of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) .",
    "only the 65 sources detected in both the f110w and f160w bands are shown .",
    "brown dwarfs can not be positively identified using near - ir photometry alone . however , those sources which are faint and relatively blue are more likely to be low - mass objects in the cloud than background stars seen through the cloud , especially if they are coincident with high extinction regions .",
    "we identified ten candidate brown dwarfs in our sample , using the following criteria : i ) ( j - h)@xmath51 3.0 , ii ) j@xmath2015 , and iii ) position coincident with cloud extinction values of @xmath52 mag .",
    "spectral types have been published for three of these objects .",
    "one object , 162622@xmath53242409 is almost certainly sub - stellar , having been assigned a spectral type of m6.5 by both wilking , greene , & meyer ( 1999 ; hereafter wgm ) and luhman & rieke ( 1999 ; hereafter lr ) , and having a luminosity of 0.002 - 0.003 @xmath54 .",
    "the mass of object 162622@xmath53242354 is less certain .",
    "wgm classify it as m8.5 with @xmath55 , whereas lr adopt a spectral type of m6.5 and a luminosity of 0.067 @xmath54 .",
    "the third classified object , 162659@xmath53243556 , is a star of type m4 ( lr ) , too hot to be a brown dwarf .",
    "the remaining seven ( new ) brown dwarf candidates are noted in table 2 .",
    "they are located in core a , which contains the highest density of stars in the survey (   3.1 ) .",
    "two of the candidates , 162622@xmath53242409 and 162622@xmath53242408 , are members of triple systems (   [ multi ] and table 3 ) .",
    "one of the candidates , 16265@xmath53242303 , is just on the red edge of our color criterion , but qualifies for selection when photometric uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "there are a total of ten known brown dwarfs in the ophiuchus cluster ( lr , wgm ) and another five sources known to occupy the transition region in the hr diagram between the stellar and substellar regimes ( wgm ) .",
    "if all of the seven new candidates identified here are indeed substellar , the number of brown dwarfs known in the ophiuchus cluster will have increased by 50%-70% .",
    "we can assess the implications for the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in the cluster .",
    "however , because fainter , lower - mass objects can not be seen as deeply into the cloud as higher - mass stars , we restrict our analysis to an extinction - limited sample . in figure",
    "[ fig : cm ] , there are 30 sources within an extinction - limited region delimited by the @xmath56 yr isochrone and the @xmath57 mag limit .",
    "these include our seven new candidate brown dwarfs , and the two confirmed brown dwarfs .",
    "if all seven of the new candidates are brown dwarfs , the total fraction of substellar objects in the extinction - limited sample is 9/30 = 30% .",
    "this is consistent with the results of lr , who argued that the imf includes a large fraction of sub - stellar mass objects .",
    "several interesting extended objects were covered by our survey , including the well - known infrared sources gss 30 , ylw 15a and ylw 16a , as well as some catalogued objects whose morphologies were previously unresolved .",

    "the nebula illuminated by irs 1 has itself been the subject of many investigations .",
    "near - infrared polarimetry images @xcite delineate a bipolar morphology coincident with the near - ir emission on the northeast side , and extending to the southwest side , where there is less infrared emission .",
    "the polarization pattern is approximately centrosymmetric around the illuminating source , and shows a `` polarization disk '' orthogonal to the long axis of the nebula .",
    "zhang et al . ( 1997 ) detected a somewhat flattened molecular core in c@xmath15o and @xmath59co ( j=10 ) , in roughly the same orientation as the polarization disk .",
    "in the high resolution image presented in figure  [ fig : plate ] one sees the characteristic hourglass morphology of a bipolar nebula .",

    "thus it is possible that ylw 16a is a single star+disk+envelope , rather than an embedded binary system .    * gy 273 ( 162728@xmath53242721 ) : * large sigma - shaped nebula .",
    "it is unclear from our images where the illuminating source is .",
    "we have presented a nicmos 3 survey in the f110w and f160w filters of the dense star - forming cores of the ophiuchus molecular cloud . among our results :    \\1 .",
    "the number of sources detected at f160w is 165 , of which 65 were detected at f110w .",
    "based on a search of the literature , we estimate that approximately two - thirds of the sources detected at f160w were previously uncatalogued . of the 108 sources located within the @xmath2240 mag .",
    "contour of the cloud , 58 were previously uncatalogued .",
    "the ophiuchus star forming region has multiple peaks in stellar density . in core",
    "a we measure @xmath60 within a volume 0.05 - 0.08 pc on a side , and in cores b and e , @xmath61 within similar volumes .",
    "such densities are similar to those seen on larger scales in rich clusters such as the orion nebula cluster .",
    "seven new candidate brown dwarfs were identified from their positions in a color - magnitude diagram . according to our analysis of an extinction - limited sample , sub - stellar mass objects may account for as many as 30% of the sources in the core of the ophiuchus cluster .",
    "we are grateful to al schultz at stsci for valuable advice , and to l. bergeron of stsci for expert help with nicmos data reduction .",
    "we thank bruce wilking for providing data which allowed us to reproduce his @xmath1 map , and john carpenter for sharing his encoded version of wainscoat et al.s galaxy model .",
