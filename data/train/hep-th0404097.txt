    "in field theory , a metastable false vacuum may decay either by tunneling or by thermal activation .",
    "tunneling is described by a solution of the euclidean field equations symmetric under spacetime rotations @xcite . in flat space and at zero temperature",
    "this is the instanton with the least action , and hence represents the dominant contribution to the decay rate @xcite . at sufficiently high temperature ,",
    "thermal activation is more probable than tunneling , and the rate is dominated by a static solution which represents a spherical critical bubble in unstable equilibrium between expansion and collapse @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of this solution is o(3)@xmath0 u(1 ) , where the u(1 ) factor corresponds to translations along the compactified euclidean time direction .",
    "as shown by coleman and de luccia @xcite , gravity can be easily incorporated into the description of tunneling .",
    "when the initial state is a false vacuum with a positive energy density , the initial geometry corresponds to a de sitter - like exponential expansion .",
    "a bubble which materializes through quantum tunneling has zero energy , and consequently ( in the thin wall limit ) the geometry outside of the bubble remains unaffected by the nucleation event .",
    "after nucleation , the bubble walls accelerate outward , and the volume of the new phase increases at the expense of the old one .",
    "however , due to the presence of event horizons in de sitter , the growth of a single bubble can not engulf the whole space . if the nucleation rate per unit volume @xmath1 is large compared to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the inverse de sitter radius , the foam of nucleated bubbles will percolate and the phase transition will complete .",
    "but if @xmath4 , the rate at which bubbles nucleate and grow does not catch up with the exponential expansion of the false vacuum . in this case , the volume of the false vacuum keeps increasing with time and the transition never fully completes in the whole spacetime ( leading to eternal old inflation )",
    ". however , any observer will experience a local transition to the new vacuum phase in a finite proper time .",
    "on the other hand , the description of thermal activation can be more involved when the self - gravity of the bubbles and of the thermal bath is considered . in the cosmological context ,",
    "the thermal bath drives the expansion of the universe , and the temperature becomes time dependent . because of that , exact instantons can not be constructed . in low energy cosmological phase transitions ( e.g. at the electroweak scale )",
    "it is safe to ignore the self - gravity of the bubbles , and to use the flat spacetime results for the nucleation rate .",
    "if this rate is sufficiently large , the phase transition completes as the bubbles percolate , typically after a short period of supercooling and subsequent release of latent heat by the nucleated bubbles @xcite .",
    "but if the rate is too small , there is a strong supercooling and the thermal bath dilutes away ; the false vacuum starts dominating before the phase transition is complete , and we are back to the situation described at the end of the previous paragraph @xcite .",
    "note , however , that even when all matter has been diluted away , the false vacuum dominated de sitter expansion can be considered to have a non - vanishing temperature @xcite @xmath5 , which does not dilute further as the universe expands .",
    "one may then ask whether this leads to thermal activation , and if so , at what rate does it proceed . in",
    "what follows , we shall discuss the corresponding instanton , describing the nucleation of a pair of critical bubbles in unstable equilibrium between expansion and collapse .",
    "it should be noted that the theorem in ref .",
    "@xcite does not necessarily apply to de sitter space , and hence it is not clear a priori whether this new instanton has higher action than the usual coleman - de luccia one .",
    "static self - gravitating instantons with o(3 ) symmetry have previously been considered in a variety of contexts , notably for the description of false vacuum decay in the presence of a black hole ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the particular solution we shall consider here corresponds to pair creation of critical bubbles in de sitter , and to our knowledge it does not seem to have received much attention in the past . the following is an extended version of the discussion given by the present authors in @xcite . in section",
    "ii we describe the solution . in section",
    "iii we discuss the action and the nucleation rate . in section",
    "iv we consider the limit in which the mass of the nucleated bubbles is small .",
    "section v is devoted to the opposite limit , when the gravity of the bubbles is very important . in section",
    "vi we compare the action for thermal activation with the action for tunneling ( through the coleman - de luccia instanton ) .",
    "section vii compares the process of thermal activation of seeds of the new phase with a related process recently discussed by gomberoff et al .",
    "@xcite , by which most of space would jump to the new phase except for a pair of bubbles which contain the  remnant \" of the old phase .",
    "section viii is devoted to conclusions .",
    "unlike the case of the coleman - de luccia bubble , the energy of a critical bubble is different from zero , and consequently , the metric outside of it is no longer pure de sitter but schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) .",
    "the instanton is a solution of the euclidean equations of motion , with two metrics glued together at the locus of the wall , which is a surface of constant @xmath6 in the static chart of sds ( see fig .",
    "[ estatico ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we shall restrict attention to the case where the vacuum energy density is positive in both the initial and the final states .",
    "also , we shall assume that the thin wall approximation is valid @xcite .",
    "the metric outside is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 the metric inside is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 here @xmath12 is newton s constant .",

    "the above equations are valid only as long as @xmath45 [ otherwise ( [ ges ] ) would yield @xmath46 , which is meaningless ] .",
    "thus , from ( [ themass ] ) , we require @xmath47 , or @xmath48 , where @xmath49 ( the case with @xmath50 will be discussed in section v. ) the mass parameter satisfies @xmath51 for @xmath52 , the equation @xmath53 has three real solutions",
    ". one of them , say @xmath54 , is negative and the other two are positive .",
    "the two positive roots correspond to the black hole and cosmological horizons .",
    "we call them respectively @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    ". therefore we can write @xmath57 in the present case , with @xmath48 , the horizon at @xmath55 is not present , since the exterior metric is matched to an interior metric at some @xmath58 ( see fig .",

    "the metric is just a ball of de sitter in the static chart , and it is regular down to the center of symmetry at @xmath60 . in general , the size of the cosmological horizon is given by @xmath61 where we have introduced the angle @xmath62 in the limit @xmath63 the angle @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .    according to eq  ( [ ges ] ) , on the bubble wall we have @xmath66 , so the equation @xmath67 has a double zero instead of two different roots .",
    "this means that the radius of the instanton will coincide with the radius of one of the horizons only in the special case where both horizons have the same size , @xmath68 . as we shall see in section v",
    ", this limit corresponds to @xmath69 , for which the exterior metric is the nariai solution @xcite , with mass parameter @xmath70 given in ( [ mmax ] ) and with @xmath71 .",
    "there , we shall also comment on the case @xmath50 , which is not covered by the present discussion .",
    "regularity of the euclidean solution will determine the periodicity of the euclidean time coordinate ( and the thermal properties of the solution ) .",
    "for @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 in terms of the new coordinates @xmath75",
    "the metric ( [ metrico ] ) for @xmath76 reads @xmath77 so it is clear that @xmath78 is an angle , @xmath79 , and @xmath19 varies in the range @xmath80 .",

    ", the instanton presented here describes the creation of _ pairs _ of bubbles .",
    "as we have just seen , the euclidean time runs on a circle @xmath84 ( see fig .",
    "the geometry at the time of nucleation is obtained by slicing the compact instanton through a smooth spacelike surface which cuts the @xmath84 factor at two places , say , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the resulting geometry contains two different bubbles separated by a distance comparable to the inverse expansion rate .",
    "the nucleation rate is determined by the euclidean action , which turns out to have a rather simple expression in terms of @xmath16 .",
    "the action is given by @xmath87 by the equations of motion , the scalar curvature is given by @xmath88 and hence the on shell action is given by @xmath89 the first integral in ( [ actionstatic ] ) is just the volume of a two - sphere of radius @xmath17 times @xmath90 .",
    "the second integral in ( [ actionstatic ] ) splits into the contributions from the two different vacua , @xmath91 so the instanton action is @xmath92 after some algebra @xmath93 can be written in the simple form @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the area of the horizon at @xmath16 .",
    "the exponent @xmath96 which gives the probability for brane nucleation is the difference in actions between instanton and background .",
    "the action of the background is just @xmath97 so the difference in actions between the instanton and the background is given by @xmath98 this expression could have been anticipated from general arguments .",
    "the action of a static euclidean solution with periodicity @xmath99 is given by @xcite @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the _ total _ energy and @xmath102 is the entropy . for a closed solution , without a boundary , the total energy vanishes @xmath103 .",
    "hence , the euclidean action is equal to the entropy of the solution , which is just one fourth of the sum of the areas of all horizons .",
    "hence , eq . ( [ b ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath104 , and the transition probability is proportional to @xmath105 as both the initial and the final solutions can be said to represent macroscopic states in thermal equilibrium , their entropy can be interpreted as the logarithm of the corresponding number of microstates in the microcanonical ensemble with @xmath103 .",
    "the transition probability is then simply proportional to the relative number of microstates .",
    "if the bubbles are sufficiently light , @xmath106 , and provided that @xmath107 , eq .",
    "( [ varphi ] ) gives @xmath108 , and from ( [ b ] ) we have @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "since the mass of the bubble is small , its appearance does not significantly change the temperature of the horizon . in such case",

    "the entropy of the reservoir must decrease by @xmath113 @xcite . from the discussion at the end of the last section , @xmath114 , and hence for bubbles of small mass we obtain ( [ bm ] ) .",
    "let us now consider a few specific limiting cases , starting with the case of low tension branes , @xmath115 , with @xmath116 . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath41 is large compared with @xmath23 , @xmath117 , and we have @xmath118 this is just the flat space expression for the energy of a critical bubble .",

    ".    at finite temperature , jumps to a vacuum with a higher energy density are also possible . in the absence of gravity , these jumps are frustrated because the bubbles of the new phase tend to recollapse .",
    "when gravity is included , the expansion of the universe can keep these  false vacuum \" bubbles from contracting ( this is true also for the case of tunneling bubbles @xcite ) .",
    "hence , let us consider again the case of low tension branes , @xmath121 , but now with @xmath122 .",

    "this approximately coincides with the bounce action for the homogeneous hawking - moss instanton @xcite , representing the upward jump of a horizon sized region of de sitter space into a higher false vacuum .",
    "finally , we may consider the case of intermediate tension @xmath130 .",
    "this leads to @xmath131 , and @xmath132 . in this case",
    ", the difference in pressure between inside and outside of the brane is insignificant compared with the brane tension term , which is balanced against collapse by the cosmological expansion .",
    "the energy of the critical bubble is @xmath133 .",
    "note , from ( [ betar ] ) , that the inverse temperature @xmath134 is different from the one experienced by a geodesic observer at the origin of coordinates @xmath60 .",
    "this is because observers at @xmath135 are in fact accelerating . from the point of view of the observer at @xmath60 ,",
    "the energy of the bubble is @xmath136 , because of the gravitational potential contribution .",
    "hence , taking into account that @xmath137 the exponent in the boltzmann suppression factor can be written as @xmath138 , and we have @xmath139 .",

    "we must determine the position @xmath161 of the bubble wall , which is given as before by the matching conditions ( [ discont2 ] ) , where now the metric outside is ( [ nariai ] ) .",
    "so , on the wall , we have @xmath162 the extrinsic curvature on the outside is @xmath163 , with @xmath164 and @xmath165 , i.e. , @xmath166 the curvature inside is as before @xmath167 and @xmath168 , with @xmath169 , so the israel conditions give @xmath170 these equations are easily solved and give @xmath171 so @xmath24 must be less than @xmath172 .",

    "( [ ges ] ) , @xmath180 would be negative ] .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , above this threshold a static solution can still be constructed by gluing the interior solution ( [ metrici ] ) to the @xmath181 portion of the exterior sds solution ( [ metrico ] ) ( rather than using the @xmath182 portion ) .",
    "this changes the sign of @xmath183 in the exterior , and the junction conditions become @xmath184 where the curly brackets denote twice the average value on both sides of the bubble wall .",
    "( [ ges ] ) is then replaced by @xmath185 but eqs .",
    "( [ x ] ) through ( [ themass ] ) remain the same .",
    "the instanton would still look pretty much as in fig . 1 , but with the cosmological horizon of radius @xmath16 replaced by a black hole horizon of radius @xmath186 .",
    "hence , in the right pannel of fig .",
    "1 , the horizontal maximal circles would grow from @xmath18 to @xmath17 as we move up from the center of the bubble , but then the circles would start decreasing from @xmath17 to @xmath55 as we continue from the bubble wall to the horizon .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the euclidean action for this solution , which is given by @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the area of the black hole horizon , with @xmath189 and where @xmath190 is given by ( [ varphi ] ) .",
    "the corresponding bounce action @xmath191 is perfectly finite , since the instantons involved are both compact and regular .",
    "moreover , @xmath192 , as it should be if this is to be interpreted as a process with an exponentially suppressed rate .",
    "is this instanton suitable for describing vacuum decay in the usual sense ?",
    "let us assume that we are in a false vacuum phase , and for simplicity , that the false vacuum decay rate per unit volume is exceedingly small compared with @xmath2 .",
    "then we expect that after some time the metric will take the form @xmath193 over an exponentially large portion of space ( with the exception of small portions of volume carved out by bubbles of the new phase which may have nucleated ) . in the solution described in section ii",
    ", an asymptotic region with metric ( [ dsflat ] ) can be found ( upon analytic continuation ) in the region beyond the cosmological horizon , which is asymptotically de sitter and infinite in volume in a flat slicing . in the case we are considering in this subsection",

    "conversely , contraction of the bubble wall would be perceived as contraction from both sides of the bubble wall .",
    "if one of the bubbles expands , it eventually generates an infinitely large region of the false vacuum phase surounding the black hole , and the metric in the false vacuum region far away from the black hole has the asymptotic form ( [ dsflat ] ) .",

    "perhaps this is not unreasonable , since a baby universe which is entirely filled with the old vacuum phase would have an entropy which is higher by the amount @xmath203 , relative to the entropy of the baby universe containing the static bubble .",
    "this suggests that most attempts should produce a baby universe of the old phase , without a bubble of the new phase .",
    "however , we should also keep in mind that the instanton representing this alledgedly more frequent process does not exist ( the solution would contain two horizons at different temperatures , and hence the euclidean section would have a conical singularity at one of them ) .",

    "the interaction of the membrane with the gauge field takes the form @xmath232 , where @xmath233 is the membrane charge , and the integral is over the membrane worldsheet .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that @xmath234 is discontinuous accross the membrane , and a somewhat heuristic prescription was given to compute the contribution of @xmath232 to the action and to perform the background subtraction .",
    "the result of this procedure , however , differs from eq .",
    "( [ biarea ] ) . here",
    ", we shall not try to elucidate the reason for this discrepancy .",
    "we note , however , that the on - shell euclidean action for the system of a membrane coupled to @xmath234 and to gravity , and with proper inclusion of boundary terms @xcite , can be shown to be the same as the action we have taken as our starting point ( [ actionstatic ] ) with @xmath235 replaced by @xmath236 , where @xmath237 is the field strength [ see e.g. eq . ( 6.1 ) in ref .",
    "hence , the results of the present paper , which are in principle valid for the case of vacuum decay in field theory , may as well be valid for the case of the brane coupled to the antisymmetric tensor field . ]",
    "@xmath238 where @xmath239 is the change in the area of the horizon and @xmath240 is the change in the entropy .",
    "it is clear from ( [ tigger ] ) that @xmath241 here , we have used the fact that @xmath242 , since the cdl instanton solution is the same for upward and for downward jumps , and all that changes is the background subtraction @xcite .",
    "the inequalities above come from the fact that @xmath243 is always larger than @xmath211 , as shown in the previous section .",
    "it follows that @xmath244 is also always larger than @xmath211 , and so the creation of remnants is also subdominant with respect to the tunneling process represented by the cdl instanton .",
    "finally , we may ask which of the two processes is more important , the creation of seeds or the creation of remnants . from ( [ arrows ] )",
    "we have @xmath245 hence , if one of the channels is dominant for upward jumps , then it means that the other process is dominant for downward jumps .",
    "[ staticsobreterma ] shows the ratio @xmath246 .",
    "note that if @xmath247 , corresponding to downward jumps , then the process of pair creation of seeds is much more likely than the process of pair creation of remnants . on the other hand , for @xmath248",
    ", corresponding to upward jumps , the ratio of the bounce actions is very close to one [ although , from ( [ relat ] ) , the frequency of upward jumps through creation of remnants outweighs that of upward jumps through creation of seeds by the same factor as downward jumps through creation of seeds outweight downward jumps through creation of remnants . ]    finally , let us recall that the nariai limit corresponds to @xmath249 [ see eq .",

    "@xmath254 and @xmath255 , the nariai curve corresponds to @xmath256 for pair creation of remnants with the same initial and final states as the seeds , we have @xmath257 and @xmath258 , and the nariai limit corresponds to @xmath259 the nariai curves @xmath260 and @xmath261 , corresponding to the circle ( [ circle ] ) and the hyperbola ( [ hyperbola ] ) are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ staticsobreterma ] .",
    "de sitter vacua are believed to be metastable at best ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "it is well known that vacuum transitions from a metastable vacuum can proceed through quantum tunneling , which is described by the coleman - de luccia instanton .",
    "this process can take us to lower energy vacua , but also to other de sitter vacua with a higher vacuum energy density @xcite .    here",
    ", we have investigated an alternative process , by which critical bubbles of the new phase can be pair produced .",
    "this process is the analog of thermal activation in flat space .",
    "the mass @xmath21 and radius @xmath17 of the `` seeds '' of the new phase are given by eqs .",
    "( [ x ] ) and ( [ themass ] ) , in terms of the initial and final vacuum energies , @xmath262 and @xmath263 , and of the tension @xmath22 of the wall separating both phases .    for @xmath264 , the geometry of the critical bubbles is the following ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . outside the bubble , the metric is schwarzschild - de sitter , and has a cosmological horizon .",
    "the black hole horizon is not present , since we are matching to an interior solution at some @xmath265 , where @xmath17 is the bubble radius and @xmath55 is the radius of the would be black hole horizon .",
    "inside the bubble , the metric is pure de sitter with curvature radius @xmath266 . for @xmath267 ,",
    "the nucleation rate is proportional to the boltzmann factor @xmath268 as would be expected from simple thermodinamical arguments . here",
    "@xmath269 is the inverse de sitter temperature of the old vacuum phase .",
    "for @xmath270 the metric outside of the bubble corresponds to the nariai limit of the schwarzschild - de sitter solution , for which the black hole and cosmological horizons have the same size . beyond the nariai limit ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath271 , the asymptotic form of the solution changes quite drastically @xcite .",
    "the static solution with a pair of critical bubbles has a black hole horizon instead of a cosmological horizon .",
    "the interpretation of such solution is less clear than in the case @xmath272 , but we have argued that it may correspond to the creation of a baby universe containing a bubble of the new phase .",
    "the nucleation rate is formally given by ( [ unex ] ) , and does not have the simple form ( [ conc ] ) even in the case when the mass @xmath21 is small ( here , @xmath21 is the mass of the black hole connecting the asymptotic region of the old phase with the baby universe ) .",
    "we have compared the process of thermal activation of seeds to an alternative process recently suggested by gomberoff et al .",
    "@xcite , by which most of space would suddenly jump to the new vacuum phase , leaving only a pair of critical bubbles as remnants of the old phase .",
    "these could subsequently collapse into black holes , with the net result that the vacuum  dark \" energy , is transformed into cold  dark matter \" in the form of black holes .",
    "we find that for downward jumps , this process is subdominant with respect to the thermal activation of seeds of the new vacuum . for upward jumps ,",
    "the bounce actions are comparable , and in fact the creation of remnants may be slightly favoured with respect to the creation of seeds ( although when we are going up in energy we are not transforming dark energy into dark matter , but simply increasing both of them ! ) .    also , we have compared the rate of nucleation of critical bubbles by thermal activation with the rate of bubble nucleation by quantum tunneling , described by the coleman - de luccia ( cdl ) instanton .",
    "the cdl instanton always has a lower bounce action than the process of thermal activation of seeds or remnants .",
    "thus , even if thermal activation is possible , it appears that jumps between neighboring vacua will be more frequent through quantum tunneling .",
    "for the case of upward jumps , however , the corresponding actions are comparable ( see fig .",
    "since the action for thermal activation is higher than that for tunneling , one should ask whether there are any situations where the former process may nevertheless be relevant . note that if the bubble wall carries some internal degrees of freedom , their entropy will be accounted for in the prefactor which accompanies the leading expression @xmath273 for the nucleation rate .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ hite ] ) that the temperature the bubble wall can be very high if the wall tension and the vacuum energies in the two phases are suitably adjusted .",
    "hence the entropy of the internal degrees of freedom can be very high , making up perhaps for the difference in actions .",
