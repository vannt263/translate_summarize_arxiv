    "the interactions between the microscopic particles , e.g. , the ions in paul trap  @xcite , the neutral atoms confined in optical lattice  @xcite , and the electrons in penning trap  @xcite , etc . , relate usually to their masses and the inter - particle forces . due to the small mass and the strong coulomb interaction ,",
    "the interacting electrons could be used to implement quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "the idea of quantum computing with strongly - interacting electrons on liquid helium was first proposed by platzman and dykman in 1999  @xcite . in their proposal ,",
    "the two lower hydrogen - like levels of the surface - state electron are encoded as a qubit , and the effectively interbit couplings can be realized by the electric dipole - dipole interaction . when the liquid helium is cooled on the order of mk temperature the qubit possesses long coherent time ( e.g. , up to the order of ms )  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , lyon suggested  @xcite that the qubits could also be encoded by the spins of the electrons on liquid helium , and estimated that the qubit coherent time could reach @xmath0  s  @xcite .",
    "he showed further that the magnetic dipole - dipole interactions between the spins could be used to couple the qubits , if the electrons are confined closed enough .",
    "for example , the coupling strength can reach to the order of khz for the distance @xmath1 m between the electrons  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , recent experiments  @xcite demonstrated the manipulations of electrons ( confining , transporting , and detecting ) on liquid helium in the single - electron regime .",
    "this provides really the experimental platforms to realize the relevant qip with electrons on liquid helium  @xcite .    here , we propose an alternative approach to implement qip with electronic spins on liquid helium by coherently manipulating the spin - orbit interactions of the electrons . in our proposal ,",
    "the virtues of long - lived spin states ( to encode the qubit ) and strong coulomb interaction ( for realizing the expectably - fast interbit operations ) are both utilized .",
    "the electrons are trapped individually on the surface of liquid helium by the micro - electrodes . in the plane of liquid helium surface",
    "each electron moves as a harmonic oscillator .",
    "it has been showed that such an external orbit - vibration could be effectively coupled to the internal spin of a single electron by applying a magnetic field with a gradient along the vibrational axis  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we show that the spin of an electron could be coupled to the vibrational motion of another distant electron [ as a jaynes - cummings ( jc ) type interaction ] , by designing a proper virtual excitation of the electronic vibration .",
    "the present jc interaction could be utilized to significantly enhance the spin - spin coupling between the distant electrons , and implement the desirable quantum computation with the spin qubits on liquid helium .",

    "iii , we propose an approach to implement the jc coupling between the spin of an electron and the orbital motion of another electron .",
    "based on such a distant spin - orbit interaction , we show that a two - qubit controlled - not ( cnot ) gate and an orbit - enhanced coupling between the distant spins could be implemented .",

    "this potential indicates that the motions of the trapped electron are a 1d stark - shifted hydrogen along the @xmath14-direction , and a 2d harmonic oscillator in the plane parallel to the liquid helium surface .",
    "the hamiltonian for the orbital motions of the trapped electron can be written as @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the @xmath25th bound state of the hydrogenlike atom , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the bosonic operators of the vibrational quanta of the electron along the @xmath28-direction .",

    "in fact , ref .  @xcite has arranged this spin - orbit coupling of a single electron to increase the interaction between the spin and a quantized microwave field .",
    "alternatively , we will utilize this spin - orbit coupling ( together with the electron - electron strong coulomb interaction ) to realize a strong interaction between two electronic spins and generate certain typical quantum gates .",

    "more interestingly , here the electron - electron coupling strength @xmath167 is significantly stronger ( about @xmath168 times ) than that between the trapped ions  ( e.g , @xmath169  @xcite ) , since the mass of electron is much smaller than that of the ions .",
    "we have suggested an approach to implement the qip with electronic spins on liquid helium .",
    "two long - lived spin states of the trapped electron were encoded as a qubit , and the strong coulomb interaction between the electrons was utilized as the data bus .",
    "the spin - orbit jc coupling between the spin of an electron and the vibrational motion of another distant electron is generated by designing a virtual excitation of the electronic vibration .",
    "such a distant spin - orbit interaction is further utilized to realize an orbit - mediated spin - spin coupling and implement the desirable quantum gates .",
    "compared with the ions in the paul traps , here a feature is that the mass of the electron is much smaller than that of ions , and thus a strong coulomb coupling up to 25 mhz between the electrons could reached for a distance of @xmath79 m . finally , the construction suggested here for implementing quantum computation with trapped electrons on the liquid helium should be scalable , and hopefully be feasible with current micro - scale technique .",
