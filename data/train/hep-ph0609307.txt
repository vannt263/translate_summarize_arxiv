    "during the past few years neutrino oscillation experiments have firmly established that neutrinos have non - zero masses and mixing angles among the different generations @xcite . while for the absolute scale of neutrino mass only upper limits of the order @xmath2 exist @xcite , two neutrino mass squared differences and two neutrino angles are by now known quite precisely @xcite .",
    "these are the atmospheric neutrino mass , @xmath3 [ @xmath4 ev@xmath5 , and angle , @xmath6 , as well as the solar neutrino mass @xmath7 [ @xmath8 ev@xmath5 , and angle , @xmath9 , all numbers at 3 @xmath10 c.l . for the remaining neutrino angle ,",
    "the so - called chooz @xcite or reactor neutrino angle @xmath11 , a global fit to all neutrino data @xcite currently gives a limit of @xmath12 @xmath13 3 @xmath10 c.l .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", there exist several options to explain the smallness of the observed neutrino masses .",
    "perhaps the simplest - but certainly the most popular - possibility is the seesaw mechanism @xcite . many variants of the seesaw exist , see for example the recent review @xcite . however , most realizations of the seesaw make use of a large scale , typically the grand unification scale , to suppress neutrino masses and are , therefore , only indirectly testable .    on the other hand , many neutrino mass models exist , in which the scale of lepton number violation can be as low as the electro - weak scale or lower .",
    "examples are supersymmetric models with violation of r - parity @xcite , models with higgs triplets @xcite or a combination of both @xcite , leptoquarks @xcite or radiative models , both with neutrino masses at 1-loop @xcite or at 2-loop @xcite order .",
    "radiative mechanisms might be considered especially appealing , since they generate small neutrino masses automatically , essentially due to loop factors .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on a model of neutrino masses , proposed independently by zee @xcite and babu @xcite , in which neutrino masses arise only at 2-loop order .",
    "the model introduces two new charged scalars , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , both singlets under @xmath16 , which couple only to leptons .",
    "one can easily estimate , see fig .",
    "( [ fig : mnu ] ) and the discussion in the next section , that neutrino masses in this setup are of order @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 ev for couplings @xmath19 and @xmath20 of order @xmath21 and scalar mass parameters , @xmath22 , of order @xmath23 gev .",
    "given that current neutrino data requires at least one neutrino to have a mass of order @xmath24 ev , one expects that the new scalars should have masses in the range @xmath25 tev .",
    "the model is therefore potentially testable at near - future accelerators , such as the lhc or ilc .        babu and macesanu @xcite",
    "recently re - analyzed this model in light of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation data .",
    "they identified the regions in parameter space , in which the model can explain the experimental neutrino data and tabulated in some detail constraints on the model parameters , which can be derived from the non - observation of various lepton flavour violating decay processes . here , we extend upon the results presented in @xcite by pointing out that ( a ) current neutrino data can be used to derive absolute lower limits on the branching ratios of the processes @xmath26 .",
    "especially important in view of future experimental sensitivities @xcite is that @xmath27 is guaranteed for charged scalar masses smaller than 590 gev ( 5.04 tev ) in case of normal ( inverse ) neutrino mass hierarchy . and",
    "( b ) decay branching ratios of the non - standard scalars of the model can be fixed by the measured neutrino angles ( and mass scale ) .",
    "thus , if the scalars of the model are light enough to be produced at the lhc or ilc , measuring their decay properties would serve as a direct test of the model as the origin of neutrino masses .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the lagrangian of the model , as well as its parameters in light of current oscillation data . in this part we will make extensive use of the results of @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we calculate flavour violating charged lepton decays , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , discussing their connection with neutrino physics in some detail . then , we consider the decays of the new scalars at future colliders , presenting ranges for various decay branching ratios as predicted by current neutrino data .",
    "we then close with a short discussion .",
    "as mentioned above , the model we consider @xcite is a simple extension of the standard model , containing two new scalars , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , both singlets under @xmath16 .",
    "their coupling to standard model leptons is given by @xmath30 here , @xmath31 are the standard model ( left - handed ) lepton doublets , @xmath32 the charged lepton singlets , @xmath33 are generation indices and @xmath34 is the completely antisymmetric tensor .",

    "lepton number violation in the model resides only in the following term in the scalar potential @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is a parameter with dimension of mass , its value is not predicted by the model .",
