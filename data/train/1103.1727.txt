    "in [ 5 ] katsuyuki shibata introduced a _ spatial illuminating center _ of a triangle @xmath2 of height @xmath3 , which is a point that maximizes the _ `` total brightness '' _ of a triangular park @xmath2 if a light source is located above that point by height @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see that the total brightness is proportional to the solid angle that @xmath2 subtends at the point of the light source if the height @xmath0 is fixed .",
    "let us generalize the notion of spatial illuminating center for compact subsets @xmath4 in @xmath5 with non - empty interior , and call it the _ solid angle center _ in what follows . + the existence of the solid angle center is rather straightforward , but the uniqueness does not always hold .",
    "in fact , a disjoint union of two discs of the same size has ( at least ) two solid angle centers of height @xmath3 if @xmath0 is enough small .",
    "we study the condition for the uniqueness of the solid angle center . +",
    "this type of research originated in [ 3 ] by jun ohara , where he introduced renormalization of the @xmath6-potential of the characteristic function of a compact domain in @xmath7 for @xmath8 ( we remark that the @xmath6-potential is called the riesz potential when @xmath9 satisfies @xmath10 and is called the logarithmic potential when @xmath11 . ) , and showed the uniqueness of a point that attains the maximum value of the ( renormalizaiton of ) @xmath6-potential if @xmath12 and the domain is convex . on the other hand , it is easy to show that for any compact domain there is a unique point that minimizes the @xmath6-potential if @xmath13 .",
    "thus he obtained a generalization of the barycenter , which corresponds to the case when @xmath14 .",
    "+ the main idea of [ 3 ] is to show that if the condition above is satisfied then the second derivative of ( the renormalization of ) the potential is negative on the domain using the boundary integral expression .",
    "unfortunately , this does not hold as it did for our case . to be precise , the second derivative of the solid angle function is not always negative on the domain even if the domain is convex .",
    "+ in this paper we study some properties of the solid angle center and the solid angle function , in particular the uniqueness of the solid angle center for the case when the above method does not work . + we show the following properties :    1 .",
    "the solid angle center of @xmath4 of height @xmath0 converges to the barycenter of @xmath4 as @xmath0 goes to @xmath15 .",
    "the maximum value of the solid angle function of @xmath4 is not greater than that of a disc with the same area .",
    "the equality holds if and only if @xmath4 is a disc .",
    "the integral of the solid angle function over @xmath4 is not greater than that of a disc with the same area .",
    "the equality holds if and only if @xmath4 is a disc .",
    "4 .   if @xmath4 is convex , then the solid angle fucntion is superharmonic on @xmath4 .",
    "the solid angle center of @xmath4 of height @xmath3 is unique if one of the following conditions is satisfied . 1 .",
    "if @xmath0 is not smaller than twice the diameter of @xmath4 .",
    "an improved condition will be given later .",
    "2 .   if @xmath4 is convex and axially symmetric .",
    "3 .   if @xmath4 is convex and @xmath0 is smaller than a constant that will be given later .",
    "we remark that @xmath4 is an arbitrary compact planar subset with non - empty interior in the case ( 1 ) above and the height @xmath0 is arbitrary in the case ( 2 ) .",
    "it turns out that the same argument for the second condition also works for the @xmath16-potential ( section 5 ) . +",
    "our results for the uniqueness of the solid angle center are obtained by the following procedure . using radial symmetry of the potential and moving plane method ( cf . [ 1 ] )",
    ", we can show that there is a smaller region , depending on @xmath4 , so that the complement has no chance to have any center on in .",
    "this region was introduced in [ 3 ] and is called the _ minimal unfolded region _ of @xmath4",
