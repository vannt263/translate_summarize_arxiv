    "protoplanetary disks are the cradles of young planets , where several dynamical processes are likely involved in the planet formation process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "of particular interest are the transition disks , disks with inner millimeter - dust cavities . in the last decade",
    ", observations have revealed that some transition disks are far from axisymmetric : azimuthal asymmetries in the submillimeter continuum are thought to be dust traps , triggered by vortices acting as azimuthal pressure bumps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "both spirals and vortices may indicate the presence of recently formed massive planets : in the case of a vortex through rossby wave instability ( rwi ) at the steep edges of the gap that is carved by the planet @xcite and in the case of spirals through the trigger of density waves directly by the planet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "alternative explanations for spiral arms in disks include rwi at the edge of a dead zone @xcite , accretion from an envelope @xcite and gravitational instability @xcite , although estimated disk masses generally appear to be too low for them to be self - gravitating @xcite .",
    "a natural question is whether there is any relation between the spiral arms observed in near - infrared scattered light ( from the disk surface ) and the structures seen in submillimeter emission ( from the midplane ) .",
    "although spiral features in submillimeter emission have been seen in two transition disks @xcite , they are not entirely consistent with their near infrared counterparts .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that spirals generated by planet - disk interaction more likely results from changes in the vertical structure rather than the density structure , which are hard to detect in millimeter emission . on the other hand , spirals that form through gravitational instability can trap dust @xcite , resulting in millimeter continuum spirals .    in this letter",
    "we present atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) submillimeter continuum observations at very high spatial resolution of hd  135344b ( f4 star , @xmath1140 pc , @xmath08 myr @xcite ) , a well - studied transition disk at both optical and millimeter wavelengths .",
    "the hd  135344b disk contains a @xmath040 au radius dust cavity @xcite with a minor azimuthal asymmetry along the dust ring @xcite .",
    "co observations and scattered light indicate that gas and small grains are present inside the cavity @xcite , consistent with a scenario where a massive planet at @xmath230 au has cleared its orbit and trapped the large dust further out @xcite . scattered light imaging reveal two major spiral arms @xcite , proposed to be linked to planet - disk interaction , with planets located at 55 and 126 au .",
    "the new images presented in this letter show substructure in the millimeter emission to an unprecedented level , revealing a double structure , which may be responsible for triggering the spiral arms seen in the scattered light .",
    "this new interpretation has consequences for the implied location of the putative planets .",
    "hd  135344b was observed in alma cycle 1 program 2012.1.00158.s ( pi van dishoeck ) in band 7 ( @xmath0335 ghz or 896 @xmath3 m ) in the c32 - 5 configuration ( 20 - 800 m baselines ) , previously presented in @xcite .",
    "the spectral settings and calibration are discussed in @xcite . for this work ,",
    "the continuum emission is re - imaged using superuniform rather than briggs weighting of the observed visibilities , resulting in a smaller beam size of 0.20@xmath40.16 ",
    "( figure [ fig : imagedata]a ) . in superuniform weighting ,",
    "the weights of the grid cells in the @xmath5-plane are set inversely proportional to the sampling density function , minimizing the sidelobes over an arbitrary field size , whereas briggs weighting sets the weights also inversely proportional to the noise variance of each visibility .",
    "the peak s / n decreases from 210@xmath6 ( briggs ) to 120@xmath6 ( superuniform ) with @xmath6 the rms level ( 0.25 mjy beam@xmath7 ) .",
    "we also make use of archival data of hd135344b obtained in polarization differential imaging ( pdi ) in the k@xmath8 band ( @xmath02.2 micron ) @xcite with vlt / naco .",
    "the data thus obtained trace the ( polarized ) scattered light from the disk surface and have angular resolution of 0.09  .",
    "figure [ fig : imagedata]a reveals that the millimeter emission does not originate from a single dust ring with an azimuthal asymmetry , but an outer azimuthal asymmetric feature in the south ( labeled f1 ) and an inner ring - like feature f2 . with the current spatial resolution it remains unclear whether they are connected in the south - west .",
    "these features are located at 45 and 75 au radius .",
    "the f1 feature is at least 4 times brighter than its opposite side in the north , while the f2 ring is almost azimuthally symmetric , with an azimuthal contrast of at most a factor 1.2 .",
    "the peak brightness temperature is 20 k , implying that the emission is optically thick even at this wavelength ( 896 @xmath3 m ) .",
    "figure [ fig : imagedata]b shows the overlay of the pdi image ( multiplied by the squared distance to the central star ) on top of the alma data .",
    "the alma features appear to follow the spiral structure : f1 is at the end of the spiral s1 ( as defined in @xcite ) while f2 appears to overlap with s2 .",
    "the brightest part of the s1 spiral in the west is however not cospatial with the brightest alma data points , and as we will show below s1 and f1 are related in a different way .    in the modeling ,",
    "we use the stellar position 15@xmath915@xmath1048.@xmath1142 -37@xmath120916.36 ) as derived from the @xmath13co emission , and for the deprojection a position angle of @xmath14 and an inclination of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in order to understand the morphology of the disk , two different models are investigated .",
    "model 1 follows the spiral description derived by @xcite .",
    "model 2 consists of an inner symmetric ring and outer azimuthal asymmetry , following the morphology of the image .",
    "this double structure has been seen in certain 2d hydrodynamical simulations of planet disk interaction , with a primary vortex at the outer edge of the planetary gap and subsequently , a second vortex external to the primary @xcite .",
    "we model the shape of a spiral density wave generated by a planet located at @xmath16 using the analytical shape derived by @xcite .",
    "this analytical approach describes the propagation of the wave from a launching point and it is given by    @xmath17 , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the disk scale - height at @xmath19 , disk angular velocity of @xmath20 , and sound speed @xmath21 .",
    "equation [ eq : spiral ] has been used to fit spiral arms observed in scattered light @xcite , although the approximations assumed to derive eq .",
    "[ eq : spiral ] may fail for massive planets ( @xmath22 , * ? ? ?",
    "this linear implementation results in 1 spiral for 1 planet , while in the non - linear case , one planet can generate one or more spirals @xcite .    for model 1",
    ", we fit eq .",
    "[ eq : spiral ] to the position of the maxima of f2 . for this purpose",
    "we select the pixels of the s1 arm , masking out the inner ring .",
    "we also set @xmath23 ( keplerian rotation ) , @xmath24 ( from the temperature profile in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is not well constrained by any model of the system , and at the radii of interest it ranges between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we fix the scale - height value to the average @xmath27 , so only two free parameters remain for the fit : @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which characterize the launching position of the spiral .",
    "we adopt an orthogonal distance regression fitting procedure , that searches for the curve that minimizes the sum of the distances to the data points orthogonally to the curve itself , thus assuming an observational error on both @xmath30 and @xmath31 in equation [ eq : spiral ] .",
    "we assume the uncertainty on the positions of the maxima to be equal to the fwhm of the beam . finally , each data point is weighted proportional to the corresponding pixel intensity .",
    "the fit in figure [ fig : spiraloverlay ] ( left ) shows that the f1 structure is mostly coradial and hence the spiral launching position has to be very close to the central star ( @xmath32 ) : the spiral pitch angle is close to @xmath33 .",
    "in such a scenario , f1 would be part of the 4th spiral winding .",
    "however , the density waves after the first spiral winding are damped very efficiently due to the disk viscosity and pressure torque @xcite and therefore this scenario is unrealistic to explain the observed azimuthal structure .",
    "figure [ fig : spiraloverlay ] ( right ) shows that the alma continuum does not follow the best fit to the spiral arm in scattered light ( blue dots ) .",
    "model 2 describes the structure as a combination of a ring ( f2 ) with a azimuthal asymmetry ( f1 ) .",
    "this model assumes that the asymmetry may originate from a vortex , using the vortex prescription by @xcite of a gaussian in the radial and azimuthal direction :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the flux density at @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( east of north ) are the radial and azimuthal position of the asymmetry respectively , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the radial and azimuthal width of the asymmetry .",
    "f2 , on the other hand , is modeled as a gaussian ring ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the flux density at @xmath43 , and where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the radial position and width of the ring respectively .",
    "our model has therefore 8 free parameters ( 5 for the asymmetry and 3 for the ring model ) , and we fit it to the image using the mcmc python package ` emcee ` .",
    "the chains from the fit show good convergence for all the free parameters , and the best fit parameters are : +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the errors from the mcmc calculations are much smaller than the spatial uncertainty from the observations , which is typically @xmath45 of the beam size ( i.e. 2 - 3 au ) .",
    "figure [ fig : gaussfit ] shows the comparison between the convolved model and the observations .",
    "the best fit was simulated onto the observed visibilities , and no significant differences were found with the convolved image .",
    "some residuals are still present , mostly due to the asymmetry in the inner ring , but at the 10% level of the original flux .",
    "the radius of the vortex is at a larger radius than found by earlier fitting of the millimeter data @xcite , which could be due to their central position being 11 au away from this study .",
    "the f1 feature is not consistent with the spiral arm prescription , but it can be described as a ring ( @xmath46 au ) with an asymmetry at @xmath47 au . therefore we propose a new alternative scenario for this disk to explain the structure of both millimeter and scattered light data .",
    "the millimeter geometry is consistent with a model from @xcite , showing that a planet generates a pressure bump at @xmath48 au ( f2 ) , which triggers a second generation vortex at @xmath49 au ( f1 ) . the cavity radius of the gas and small grains @xcite suggests the presence of a massive planet at 30 au .",
    "a millimeter dust ring at 50 au ( f2 ) is consistent with this scenario , as the dust is trapped further out than the gas gap edge @xcite .",
    "the alma and pdi data trace different grain size populations and disk heights , possibly driven by different mechanisms .",
    "however , it is striking that f1 coincides with the edge of the s1 arm .",
    "we propose that the s1 is triggered by a vortex that has created the dust asymmetry f1 , since vortices can be massive enough to launch their own density waves in a disk when self - gravity is included in hydrodynamical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "only a lower limit to the mass of the f1 feature can be set as the emission is partially optically thick : with a total flux of @xmath0200 mjy and a ism gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , the total mass is @xmath5016 m@xmath51 ( using @xmath52 m@xmath51 , @xcite ) .",
    "the outer extent of s1 ( outside the vortex ) remains undetectable in the pdi image due to the lower brightness in the outer disk .",
    "@xcite find a best - fit for the launching point of s1 at @xmath53=0.39 \" ( 55 au ) at @xmath54=204@xmath12 , but with a large confidence interval ( see figure 5 in muto et al . ) .",
    "fitting the s1 spiral with an initial guess close to the center of the vortex results in the fit in figure [ fig : fits12]a with @xmath55 ( 84 au ) and @xmath56 .",
    "this launching point does not coincide exactly with the center of f1 , although there is a large uncertainty due to the unknown scale height at this location .",
    "furthermore , alma continuum observations trace the mm - dust , whose center may not coincide with the gas vortex @xcite , and the vortex can be a large scale structure where the center of mass may not be well represented by a single location , contrary to a planet .    on the other hand ,",
    "the s2 spiral was best - fit by @xcite for @xmath57=0.9 `` ( 126 au ) , 353@xmath12 , but we find that it can also be fit with a launching point in the inner part of the disk for @xmath57=0.23 '' ( 32 au ) , 211@xmath12 ( figure [ fig : fits12]b ) . the launching point of s2 would be a massive planet , just inside the gas cavity radius @xcite . @xcite",
    "finds a best fit for the s2 launching point to the vlt / sphere data slightly further in , at @xmath57=0.15 \" ( 21 au ) , 247@xmath12 .      1 .   a massive planet is formed at @xmath030 au radius .",
    "2 .   the planet triggers a spiral density wave outwards ( pdi s2 feature ) .",
    "3 .   the planet clears its orbit in the gas ( co observations ) and creates a radial pressure bump at its edge where millimeter - dust gets trapped ( alma continuum f2 feature ) .",
    "4 .   the pressure bump creates an effective @xmath58 viscosity that is large enough to induce accretion , depleting the gas and inducing a second pressure bump further out .",
    "the second pressure bump triggers rwi , forms a vortex and traps the millimeter - dust asymmetrically ( alma continuum f1 feature ) .",
    "the outer vortex triggers a spiral density wave inwards ( pdi s1 feature ) .",
    "this scenario can potentially explain both pdi and millimeter observations .",
    "hydrodynamical models of gas and dust , including self - gravity , are required to check whether our proposed scenario can instead quantitatively explain the observed structures of hd135344b .",
    "one of the major uncertainties in the scenario are the fits to the locations of the launching points .",
    "the reason is that the scattered light data are mainly sensitive to changes in the scale height and therefore , the observed scattered light is significantly affected by geometric parameters .",
    "the observed spirals form only the illuminated inner part of a surface change .",
    "also , the inner disk region may shadow the outer part and thus alter the intrinsic disk scale height distribution .",
    "in particular , the azimuthal angle of the continuum alma feature coincides with the brighter part of the closer - in s2 spiral and therefore , s2 may be casting a shadow on part of s1 , affecting the fit of the launching points .",
    "another caveat is the symmetry of the two spiral arms at the time of observation , suggesting a common nature such as proposed by @xcite who demonstrates the trigger of two symmetric spiral arms by a single planet at 100 au . as this planet has remained undetected , this scenario can not be confirmed . on the other hand ,",
    "if there are instead two launching points ( 32 and 86 au ) , the two spirals would have distinct angular velocities and their symmetric appearance is fortuitous , making the scenario less probable . the orbital period of the 32 au point is only 143 years , implying a 2.5@xmath12/year angular shift . repeating the scattered light observations in 5 years should clearly reveal the motion of this arm . if the asymmetry is indeed related to a vortex , an azimuthal shift of @xmath00.1 `` ( 6@xmath12 ) in the millimeter continuum ( measurable at 0.2 '' resolution ) is detectable after 10 years .",
