    "the nature of , and connection between , star formation and agn activity in galaxies is unclear . for starbursts ,",
    "the majority of star - forming systems lie on a ` main sequence ' whose mean star formation rate ( sfr ) rises with redshift , from about 10m@xmath9 at @xmath10 to roughly 100m@xmath9 at @xmath11 ( as in e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the origin of this main sequence is however still debated , as is the trigger for star formation as a function of a galaxy s position relative to the main sequence .",
    "for agn , it is difficult to complete a robust census of agn from surveys , since they are obscured by dust and gas for a significant fraction of their lives , with this fraction possibly dependent upon both luminosity and redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is also unclear if star formation events and agn activity can directly affect one another .",
    "a direct relation is motivated by models for galaxy assembly to improve consistency between predictions and observations , most often via ` quenching ' of star formation by an agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "recently , @xcite have shown that a correlation between sfr and agn luminosity may only exist over certain agn luminosity , sfr and redshift ranges .",
    "an insightful way to study the connections between star formation and agn activity in the context of galaxy assembly events is to examine their scaling relations in populations that signpost specific regions of the agn luminosity and sfr parameter space .",
    "one such population are optically luminous type 1 quasars that host luminous , off - main sequence starbursts .",
    "this population is straightforward to find in optical surveys , corresponds to a specific phase in the agn duty cycle , and may signpost the extremes of the starburst duty cycle . as such , they may illustrate how the processes that convert free baryons to stellar and bh mass may change at the most extreme luminosities .",
    "they are also an excellent population in which to search for the initial stages of agn feedback .",
    "a related population within which it would appear intuitive to search for evidence of agn feedback is that of the broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars @xcite .",
    "the bal quasars possess broad p - cygni - like absorption features in their ultraviolet spectra that are blue - shifted with respect to the nominal wavelength of the emission line .",
    "these features may stem from outflows from the quasars and may further be associated with high mass - loss rates @xcite .",
    "these outflows could arise in two ways ; the outflows could be a random process , present for only a random fraction of the quasar lifetime and/or over certain viewing angles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the observation of bals in only 10 - 15 per cent of quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then arises from a suitable combination of these two factors .",
    "second , bals may signpost outflows that occur only at a particular point in a quasar s lifetime , most likely ` young ' objects recently ( re)fuelled by mergers that also trigger star formation in their hosts .",
    "it is this second scenario that would mean that bal quasars may signpost quasar - mode feedback .",
    "this may manifest itself via bal quasars having different far - infrared ( fir ) properties , on average , to those of ordinary quasars .    in this paper",
    ", we undertake such a study , exploring the relationship between star formation and agn activity in optically luminous quasars over @xmath12 that host extremely high sfrs , from 40@xmath134000m@xmath14yr@xmath5 , placing these hosts approximately one dex above the star formation main sequence . to do so , we start with quasars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) that also lie within extragalactic survey fields covered by the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ; * ? ? ?",

    "as such , some of the highest redshift bal quasars might be missing from our sample .",
    "the combined use of dr7 and dr10 , without any restrictions , potentially affects the overall completeness and uniformity of the sample , since the different apparent magnitude cuts in the two releases could make the combined sample incomplete in terms of redshift .",

    "moreover , @xcite , who also study the fir properties of a combined sample of quasars from dr7 and dr10 , similarly reach the conclusion that any incompleteness resulting from the non - uniform selection of targets in the two releases does not affect the validity of such a study .",

    "cirrus has structure on large scales , as opposed to the small - scale fluctuations in the map from extragalactic sources , so emission from cirrus can be removed using a high - pass filter . for consistency , we adopt the filtering technique applied for hers , as defined in @xcite , for the creation of the helms catalogue .    the confusion noise and background have been calculated from the entire map rather than on individual tiles , into which the large map has been segmented at the time of source extraction ( for details see * ? ? ?",

    "this number is smaller than the detection rates mentioned in previous works ( e.g. @xcite , who find a 30 per cent detection rate in lockman and fls at 5@xmath2 but for both type 1 and type 2 agn combined ) .",

    "for more than 90 per cent of our objects , there is a minimum of 11 and a maximum of 16 photometric data points available from the optical to the fir .",
    "to infer starburst and agn luminosities , we use the multi - component sed fitting technique described in @xcite . in the most general case",
    ", the method fits fluxes and their errors with three separate models : stellar , agn , and starburst .",
    "our sample however consists entirely of luminous type 1 quasars with extremely high sfrs .",
    "this allows us to make two key simplifications to the general method .",
    "first , it is almost certain that the stellar emission will be outshone by the agn and/or the starburst at all wavelengths , so we do not include a stellar template in the fit .",
    "second , since our sources are type 1 quasars , it is reasonable to conclude that the optical to mid - infrared ( mir ) coverage will be dominated by the agn @xcite , and that the fir coverage will be dominated by the starburst ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the infrared emission reprocessed by the agn torus strongly depends on the dust geometry .",
    "in particular , the ratio between the outer and inner radius of the torus plays a major role in determining the agn sed at longer wavelengths ( in the models used in this paper the maximum value of this ratio is 150 ) . as a result ,",
    "the peak of the infrared emission of the agn torus models lies at @xmath46@xmath42 ( fig .",
    "5 of @xcite ) and the maximum width of the infrared bump ( as defined in @xcite ) for these models is @xmath47@xmath42 .",
    "we therefore do not expect any significant contribution from the agn emission at wavelengths larger than @xmath47@xmath42 .",
    "complementary , observationally motivated discussion on this point can be found in ",
    "@xmath48 of @xcite .",
    "we note the caveat though that , with our data , which do not cover the range between 22 and 250 , we can not completely rule out significant fir emission from the agn .",
    "we thus use the shorter wavelength data to constrain the properties of the agn , and , having done so , then use the spire data to constrain the properties of the starburst .",
    "two example sed fits are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ; one for a classical quasar and one for a bal quasar .",
    "the agn component of the fit includes both the direct emission and the reprocessed emission , that is , optical / ultraviolet light that is absorbed by the dust in the torus and reradiated in the infrared .",
    "we call the luminosity of the best - fitting agn model the accretion luminosity , @xmath49 .",
    "we have assumed the smooth , continuous distribution of dust within the torus described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this set of models has been shown to accurately reproduce the seds of both obscured and unobscured agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we constrained the fit to a subset of 216 torus templates ( out of the @xmath03700 models in the full grid ) , selecting a representative set of parameters defined in @xcite .",
    "this is done to minimise degeneracies among model parameters that we do not seek to constrain , without affecting the quality of the fits for the luminosities , given that there is a large overlap in sed shapes when varying the model parameters ( for a description of the effect of each of the parameters on the sed , see * ? ? ?",
    "the starburst component is modelled with a library of templates of six starburst galaxies : arp220 ( merger ) , m82 ( disk / amorphous ) , m83 ( sab(s)c ) , ngc1482 ( e / int ) , ngc4102 ( sb ) , and ngc7714 ( sc ) .",
    "the starburst templates span systems with low ( e.g. m82 & m83 , @xcite ) to high ( e.g. arp 220 , @xcite ) extinctions and a broad range in mid- to far - ir sed shapes , star - formation histories , and hubble types .",
    "thus , they plausibly span at least a substantial fraction of the properties of star - forming galaxies at @xmath50 and have been used to model starbursts at all redshifts before ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this paper complements and builds upon other works on the star - forming properties of quasar host galaxies .",
    "we here describe how it relates to the two most closely associated works , those of @xcite and @xcite , hereafter my15 and h16 , respectively .    in many ways ,",

    ", we find the resulting matches to be highly reliable . as a result of all the above",
    ", our _ herschel_/sdss sample has 187 objects ( about a third of its size ) in common with the sample in my15 .",
    "our approach to extracting sfrs also differs to that used by my15 . my15",

    "therefore , the key difference in the derived sfrs is that , in this work , the sfrs are measured on the full range 8 - 1000@xmath42 , including the contribution to the mir .    turning to h16 , our paper complements and extends this work . in h16",

    "a total of 51 bal and 208 non - bal quasars reside in the defined area .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_trends ] , there is no preferred location for the bal quasars in any of the parameter spaces considered ( the lack of bal quasars with low sfr is due to the lower redshift cut ) . to further test if the behaviour of these bal quasars is identical to that of the non - bal quasars , we perform k - s tests to compare the @xmath49 , @xmath68 and sfr distributions of the two subsets .",
    "the bal quasars have indistinguishable @xmath49 and @xmath68 distribution from the non - bal quasars , as indicated by the @xmath79-values from the k - s test ( 0.47 and 0.46 , respectively ) .",

    "while we do not have stellar masses for our sample , their extremely high sfrs coupled with reasonable assumptions for quasar host stellar masses at this epoch mean they almost certainly lie above the ` main sequence ' for star formation at their respective epochs . in the following ,",
    "we consider the relationship between sfrs and both redshift and agn properties . finally , we discuss the implications for bal quasars .",
    "we find that the sfrs of our sample increase by a factor of up to @xmath08 from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",

    "thus , in terms of evolution over @xmath84 , extremely luminous star formation events in quasar hosts appear to evolve , on average , in a manner consistent with the global star formation history as derived from the general galaxy population .",
    "our results are also consistent with those of my15 , who find that the fraction of ir - luminous quasars peaks at @xmath82 , and with h16 , who find that sfrs in quasars do not change appreciably as a function of redshift over @xmath65 ( but see also e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they are also consistent with several previous studies of the evolution with redshift of star formation in agn hosts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these previous studies mostly sample different parts of the @xmath78-sfr-@xmath49 parameter space for quasars to our study .",
    "for example , the sample in @xcite spans a similar redshift range but has lower @xmath49 values and sfrs by @xmath85 orders of magnitude , while the sample in h16 has comparable @xmath49 values , but lies at higher redshifts with a factor @xmath86 lower sfrs .",
    "the apparent consistency of our results with theirs on the evolution of sfrs with redshift in quasar hosts is thus remarkable .",
    "this consistency suggests that the physical processes that lead to star formation in agn hosts , such as mergers or secular evolution , do so in a way that gives a similar evolution with redshift for star formation events spanning tens to thousands of @xmath87 per year and accretion luminosities @xmath88l@xmath14 .",
    "we caution however that this does not account for selection effects between studies , and only applies to time - scales significantly longer than the agn and starburst duty cycles .",
    "we first consider the relation between sfr and @xmath49 .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_trends ] is consistent with an approximately flat @xmath89 relation , in all redshift bins .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several explanations for an observed lack of a relation between sfr and @xmath49 have been proposed .",
    "they fall , broadly , into four categories .",
    "first , the strength of the relation depends on redshift , with an observable relation only emerging at @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "this could arise due to , for example , a higher free gas fraction at higher redshifts .",
    "second , agn luminosities can vary substantially on time - scales of days to months . if agn luminosities are measured using methods that are particularly sensitive to such variations , such as x - ray observations @xcite , then underlying trends could be masked @xcite .",
    "third , it is possible that at very high sfrs and/or @xmath49 values , we are sampling an intrinsically different quasar population , one in which e.g. a different trigger for star formation leads to a weaker or absent correlation between sfr and @xmath49 .",
    "fourth , at high sfrs or high @xmath49 , the properties of the starburst become decoupled from those of the agn , plausibly because internal self - regulation processes become the dominant effect in regulating luminosities on time - scales comparable to or shorter than the agn or starburst duty cycles .",
    "the first possibility is , _ on its own _ , not plausible for our sample , as our sample spans a wide range in redshift and we do not see a significant correlation in any redshift bin .",
    "the second seems unlikely , since our sample is large and has agn luminosities measured from optical , rather than x - ray data .",
    "we note however that there exists a conceptually similar possibility - that the duty cycles of starburst and agn activity are sufficiently mismatched in duration that no correlation is observed between their luminosities .",
    "the available constraints on the duty cycle lengths of starburst and agn phases are however not accurate enough for us to comment on this possibility .",
    "the third possibility also seems unlikely , since we found no differences between the _",
    "herschel_/sdss sample and the general sdss quasar population in section [ sec : sdss ] , though we can not formally exclude it .",
    "the fourth scenario , however , is plausible , since our sample harbours the highest sfrs seen in quasars , where self - regulation may be expected to be seen , if it occurs .",
    "moreover , it is consistent with observations of systems with comparable sfrs at @xmath91 , i.e. submillimetre galaxies ( smgs , @xcite ) , which exhibit a flattening in their sfrs at extremely high sfr values .",
    "an interesting corollary comes from the work of my15 , who find that star - forming regions in ir - luminous quasars do not increase in size at very high sfrs , but instead may increase in sfr _ density_. an increase in sfr density could mean that starburst self - regulation becomes more effective , via e.g. approaching the eddington limit for star formation , where winds from supernovae can expel free gas and thus stall star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we thus propose that the flat relation between sfr and @xmath49 in our sample arises because self - regulation by the starburst becomes the dominant factor controlling the sfrs .",
    "we can not , however , rule out a contribution from redshift - driven effects , or from mismatches in the lengths of duty cycles of starburst and agn episodes .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_trends ] also shows no downturn in sfrs at the highest @xmath49 values .",
    "this is , in principle , inconsistent with the idea that luminous agn can quench star formation in their host galaxies ( see also e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation is however possible ; _ assuming that agn feedback occurs _",
    ", this instead suggests that @xmath49 ( as derived from rest - frame uv observations ) is not a good proxy for the strength of agn feedback .",
    "this is consistent with agn feedback being a brief phase in the agn duty cycle , signposted by properties other than agn luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_trends ] is consistent with there being no relation between sfr and @xmath53 .",
    "this lack of a correlation is , in some senses , surprising .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that sfrs should scale with @xmath53 in quasars since sfrs should scale with the total available free gas mass or its large - scale distribution @xcite , and both the free gas mass and @xmath53 should scale with the total baryon density .",
    "thus , on @xmath92myr time - scales , sfrs and @xmath53 in quasars may be expected to correlate since a larger free baryon reservoir would favor both higher current sfrs and higher @xmath49 _ in the past_. we , however , do not see such a correlation .",
    "a plausible explanation comes from considering our results in context with those of h16 , who found that sfrs in quasars at @xmath65 do correlate with @xmath53 ( and @xmath49 ) , but only up to an sfr of @xmath93m@xmath4yr@xmath5 .",
    "above this sfr , they find no correlation .",
    "our sfrs are mostly higher than those in h16 and are measured individually , rather than stacked as in h16 , so it is interesting to compare their results to ours . in the top and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_trends ] , we plot the relations that h16 derive between sfr and @xmath49 and @xmath53 , respectively . for the sfr-@xmath49 plot our results",
    "are , given the sizes of the error bars on the average points in each redshift bin , consistent with the h16 relation .",
    "for the sfr-@xmath53 plot the consistency is weaker , but fig .",
    "17 of h16 shows , plausibly , a flattening in the sfr-@xmath53 relation at about @xmath94m@xmath4yr@xmath5 as well .",
    "overall therefore , we argue that our results and those in h16 are both consistent with the idea that sfrs in quasars correlate with @xmath49 and @xmath53 , but only up to an sfr when internal ` self - regulation ' by the starburst becomes important .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_trends ] is consistent with there being no relation between sfr and @xmath68 , at any redshift .",
    "this result is also in line with those in h16 , who also find no evidence for an @xmath95 relation , at any sfr ( modulo possible enhanced sfrs at low @xmath68 values .",
    "overall , this is consistent with there being no relation between sfrs in quasars and how efficiently the black hole is accreting , at _ any _ sfr .",
    "it is also consistent with the suggestion that @xmath68 values in quasars do not depend strongly on redshift , at least at @xmath96 ( e.g. @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "we find that there is no difference in the sfr , @xmath49 , @xmath53 , and @xmath68 distributions between the hibal and non - bal quasars in our sample ; all are consistent with being drawn from the same parent population .",
    "a minor caveat to this result is that our sample may be incomplete for hibals at very high redshifts ( sec .",
    "[ sec : sdss ] ) , an effect that we can not account for using available data ; we think it unlikely that this incompleteness could be a significant factor leading to the lack of differences between bal and non - bal quasars that we observe .",
    "this result aligns with previous studies , which find no differences between hibal and classical quasars , at any redshift @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is consistent with the study of @xcite , who also use _",
    "herschel_-spire data to compare the properties of bal versus non - bal quasars , from the h - atlas survey , and find no differences between the two populations .",
    "the two studies , however , sample different regimes in sfr ; our study examines quasars with typical sfrs of @xmath97m@xmath4yr@xmath5 , whereas the typical sfrs of the quasars in @xcite are @xmath98m@xmath4yr@xmath5 .",
    "the combined results suggest that bals are not seen preferentially in certain @xmath49 or @xmath53 regimes , and not over specific ranges in sfr , even for those quasars harbouring the most luminous star formation events seen in any quasar at any redshift .",
    "it has been argued that bal quasars may be a promising quasar population within which to look for evidence of agn feedback , since the bal winds provide a natural mechanism to couple momentum from accretion - disk winds to ism gas .",
    "the lack of any differences between the hibals and the non - bals in our sample however argues that hibal quasars are , as a population , not sites for agn feedback , unless the agn feedback phase is much shorter than the lifetime of the bal winds .",
