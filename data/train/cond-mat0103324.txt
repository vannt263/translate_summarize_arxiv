    "* + density functional theory ( dft ) states that the ground state energy of a many particle system is an exact functional of the total particle density @xmath1@xcite .",
    "unfortunately the exact functional is unknown and in order to have a practical mean of calculating the ground state energy one maps the interacting particle system onto a non - interacting , for which the total energy can be written as@xcite @xmath2=t[\\rho]+e_{{\\rm h}}[\\rho]+e_{{\\rm xc}}[\\rho]+ e_{{\\rm nn}}+e_{{\\rm en}}[\\rho],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 $ ] is the one - electron kinetic energy ( given by @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 $ ] is the hartree interaction .",
    "@xmath6 $ ] , the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential , is supposed to correct for the approximations introduced when replacing the true many - body kinetic energy by @xmath3 $ ] and the correct electron - electron interaction by @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "in addition @xmath7 is the electrostatic nucleus - nucleus interaction , and @xmath8 $ ] is the electron - nucleus interaction . since the exact xc potential is not known , one has to rely to approximations .",
    "the simplest ( and most frequently used ) approximation is the lda , which is a parameterized xc functional using a homogeneous electron density .",
    "approximate expressions for the total energy combined with efficient methods for solving the kohn - sham equations@xcite have resulted in powerful methods for studying many materials properties such as magnetism , chemical bonding , hardness , elasticity as well as surface related phenomena , including relaxation , reconstruction and chemisorption .",
    "quite frequently lda calculations reproduce experimental results with an error smaller than a few percent .",
    "however , notable exceptions exist .",
    "one problem is that the approximations leading to the lda introduce an unphysical self interaction ( si ) of a particle with itself .",
    "for instance , in the local density approximation the hartree part contains the mean - field interaction energy of an electron with itself .",
    "an exact xc functional would have a si part which would exactly cancel the si of the hartree term .",
    "the result would be a theory totally free from self interaction , giving the exact ground state energy .",
    "it may be noted here that for systems with broad bands , where the electron states form bloch states , self - interaction becomes neglibly small , whereas for systems where the electrons are localized or close to localization the self - interaction problem becomes serious . a self interaction correction ( sic ) method of dft",
    "was presented in 1981 by perdew and zunger@xcite ( here referred to as pz ) .",
    "although there exist improved schemes@xcite the pz - method is the method predominantly used .",
    "one of the virtues of the correction of pz is that for the exact xc functional the added correction becomes zero .",
    "the method of pz has been applied with some success to different systems , e.g. localized electrons in ce and pr@xcite , a 1-d hubbard model@xcite and transition metal mono oxides@xcite .",
    "although the pz version of correcting for si has been successful in many applications we question its ability to remove all self interaction and suggest , as an alternative , a novel way of performing lda - sic calculations , which is totally free from self interaction .",
    "the self interaction corrected xc energy , within the approach by perdew and zunger@xcite , applied to lda , is normally written as @xmath9= e_{{\\rm xc}}^{{\\rm lsd } } [ n]-\\sum_{i\\sigma}^{{\\rm occ } } \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\int d^3 r d^3 r ' \\frac{\\rho_i^\\sigma ( { \\bf r})\\rho_i^\\sigma ( { \\bf r } ' ) } { \\mid { \\bf r - r } ' \\mid }    +   \\frac{1}{2 } \\int d^3 r \\epsilon_{{\\rm xc}}(\\rho_i^\\sigma ( { \\bf r}),0 )   \\rho_i^\\sigma ( { \\bf r})\\right].\\ ] ] the basic idea behind this equation is to subtract the interaction energy of an electron with itself from the total energy . the second term on the right hand side of eqn.([wrong ] ) corrects for the self - hartree interaction but we choose to include this correction to the xc functional since formally one may introduce all terms there which are not found in the kinetic energy functional and the hartree functional . the last term on the right hand side of eqn.([wrong ] ) is called the self xc .",
    "the 0 in @xmath10 indicates that the correction is made separately for each spin - channel .",
    "minimization of the si corrected energy functional with respect to the density leads to kohn - sham like equations with a si corrected effective potential , @xmath11 .",
    "the corrections coming from si are normally referred to as the sic part of the potential .",
    "the correction for the self hartree interaction is exact , but as will be argued below the correction for self xc is imperfect . to illuminate the problem",
    ", we consider an lda functional ( eqn.([tote ] ) ) and take a closer look at the xc functional .",
    "it is written as @xmath12 , where one term in the xc energy density , @xmath13 , is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "let us now write the total density as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the density given by the orbital which we are interested to correct for self interaction , @xmath17 is the summed density of all other orbitals and @xmath18 the total electron density .",
    "it is now easy to see that the correction of pz , as defined in eqn.([wrong ] ) , does not remove all self xc , since with the above expressions for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we obtain from eqn.([wrong ] ) an expression for the exchange part of the energy functional @xmath21 eqn.([rho3 ] ) is not equal to @xmath22 and hence does not represent a contribution to the energy functional that is free from self interaction .    in a similar way",
    "the correction of pz does not remove the self xc interaction in the effective potential of the kohn - sham equations .",
    "the xc part of the effective potential , @xmath23 , of the kohn - sham equations is in lda written as@xcite @xmath24 2\\rho_i^{1/3 } + \\mu_c^p({\\bf r}_s)-v_c({\\bf r}_s ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where it may be seen that the exchange potential ( @xmath25 contains a term proportional to @xmath26 ( for a description of terms in eqn([xclda]),see ref .",
    "the pz corrected effective potential for electron state @xmath27 involves , analogous to eqn.([wrong ] ) , the following terms , @xmath28^{1/3}- { \\rho_i^\\sigma ( { \\bf r}})^{1/3}),\\ ] ] and we observe that due to the non - linear dependence on the electron density , @xmath29 is dependent on @xmath16 and hence si effects are present in the effective potentials well .",
    "this was also pointed out by other authors@xcite .",
    "we have now pointed out why the sic form of pz does not remove all the si and below we suggest a method which does this . in general , the approach is to identify all contributions in the lda energy expression ( eqn.([tote ] ) ) and the effective potential which contain si and to remove these interactions .",
    "writing @xmath30 , one may obtain an energy expression which is free from self - interaction , by applying the correction to the densities instead of the energies .",
    "the energies for @xmath20 are calculated from @xmath17 instead of the total density @xmath18 .",
    "lda contains a term @xmath31(\\bar{\\rho}+\\rho_i^\\sigma ) $ ] whereas the wanted expression is @xmath31\\bar{\\rho}+e(\\bar{\\rho})\\rho_i^\\sigma $ ] ( @xmath32 denoting the total energy functional ) if we only apply sic to orbital @xmath33 .",
    "the expression for the total energy , when formulated as @xmath34 , is @xmath35 \\rho_i^\\sigma    d^3 r +   \\sum_{i\\sigma } \\int [ v_{{\\rm eff}}(\\rho)-v_{{\\rm eff}}({\\bar{\\rho } } ) ] \\rho_i^\\sigma d^3 r,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the normal lda total energy expression ( eqn.([tote ] ) ) evaluated with a ks - eigenvalue obtained from eqn.([effpot_new ] ) below , the effective potential .",
    "to arrive at the expression in eqn.([tote : correct ] ) we have explicitly subtracted the parts in the lda expression which contain si and thereafter added a si free part .",
    "the effective potential to be used in the ks - equation is constructed in the usual way @xmath37}{\\delta   \\rho_i^\\sigma ( { \\bf r})}+v_{{\\rm en}},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the electron - nucleus potential 2z / r . explicitly taking the functional derivative",
    ", we get the potential @xmath39^{1/3}+v_{{\\rm en}}= \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\int \\frac{\\bar{\\rho}({\\bf r}')}{\\mid{\\bf r - r}'\\mid } d^3 { \\bf r } ' - { \\rm a}({\\bf r}){\\bar \\rho}({\\bf r})^{1/3}+v_{{\\rm en}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this effective potential is by construction totally free from si if one uses the electron density @xmath40 in the functional a@xmath41 .",
    "the hartree part in this equation coincides exactly with the hartree part in eqn.([wrong ] ) . in short ,",
    "the potential for the orbital @xmath20 can be written as @xmath42 , instead of the normal orbital independent potential @xmath43 , or the pz - sic : @xmath44 .",
    "this procedure is applicable to _ all _ approximations for the xc energy but here , for simplicity , we choose to discuss the lda . in the asymptotic limit @xmath45 the effective potential has the correct @xmath46 dependence , since we subtract one electron from the screening cloud of the neutral atom .",
    "one can arrive at eqn.([effpot_new ] ) by starting from the hartree - fock expression for the effective potential , which is free from self interaction , and then replace the fock part by a@xmath47 .",
    "this replacement then hopefully both simplifies the effective potential by making it local as well as includes correlation effects .",
    "we have implemented this new method , and the method by pz , to be able to make a comparison between the two , in a full potential linear muffin - tin orbital ( fp - lmto ) method@xcite .",
    "since pr is a material with 2 localized f - electrons which has been studied extensively by lda@xcite , pz - sic@xcite and the orbital polarization method@xcite we choose to test our theory for this element .",
    "for simplicity pr was put in an fcc structure ( observed structure is the dhcp structure ) , and we used 2197 k - points in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "the si corrected functionals were implemented only for the 4f core electrons . in the implementation",
    "we have ignored the non - orthogonality of the orbitals introduced by sic since in atomic like problems it has been shown to be negligible@xcite . the results for praseodymium are shown in the table[result : table ] where the total energy contributions are listed , and in figures  [ density : plot ] and [ potential : plot ] where the electron density and different contributions to the effective potential are displayed .",
    "[ result : table ]    .comparison between lda , pz - sic and the current sic method .",
    "the energies come from the corresponding minima in volume .",
    "the energies are the corrections to the ( lda ) 4@xmath0-electron energies given by eqn.([tote : correct ] ) for two 4f electrons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      radial density using different approximations for exchange and correlation.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]        by inspecting the 4@xmath0-density ( shown in fig.[density : plot ] ) one observes that the orbitals become more contracted when sic is used .",
    "notable is also that the radial extent of the orbital in the new sic method is largely reduced compared to the pz - sic method .",
    "we also note that compared to an atomic hartree - fock density the @xmath0-cloud is actually even more contracted . from fig.[potential : plot]b one sees that for the current sic method the main contribution to the potential entering the ks equation comes from the hartree part , the xc part provides a very small contribution .",
    "this can be compared with the pz - sic potential shown in fig.[potential : plot]a , where _ the same _ hartree part is used , but there is a big correction to the xc potential .",
    "the reason why the correction to the xc potential in this implementation is so small is that the potential has the form @xmath48 instead of the lda @xmath49 and for large values of @xmath18 the difference between them , @xmath50 , is very small . as a side remark we note that the electronic structure and density of states of the valence states is almost unchanged ( no sic is applied to the valent electrons ) , showing that the contraction of the 4cloud due to sic only marginally influences the energy - band dispersion of the valence states .    from the table[result : table",
    "] it is seen that the ks eigenvalue is significantly lower in the new sic method compared to lda and pz - sic .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0-orbital localizes more gives rise to a larger screening for the valence electrons , which as a result become more extended and for this reason a larger equilibrium volume is found .",
    "however , as is seen from the table the difference in equilibrium volumes between the different approximations is only a few percent and they agree rather well with experiment . the small deviation from experiment can be explained by a contribution to the cohesive energy from delocalized @xmath0-electrons as described previously@xcite .",
    "the cohesive energy was previously calculated from lda to be 5.09 ev / atom@xcite , a value which is 0.55 ev / atom higher than experiment .",
    "our calculation lowers the cohesive energy with 0.29 ev / atom compared to the lda calculation , and is hence in better agreement with experiment .",
    "the pz calculation lowers the cohesive energy by only with 0.17 ev / atom compared to lda .    in the table",
    "we also note that the self - hartree part is larger in our method of sic than in the pz - method , this is due to the more contracted 4@xmath0-orbital . in the pz - sic the total energy changes only by 0.25",
    "ry since the hartree correction is balanced by a change in the xc energy . in our implementation of sic the hartree energy is not balanced to the same extent by the xc energy , thus giving a change in total energy by 1.90 ry .",
    "we also compared the 4@xmath0-eigenvalue with an atomic , relativistic hartree - fock calculation on pr@xmath51 with a 4f@xmath52 configuration which is free from si ( but without correlation effects ) .",
    "this calculation gives a value of @xmath53=-2.870 ry , which may be compared to an atomic - like calculation ( a band - calculation with lattice expanded ) which gives -2.3062 ry for the new sic method , -1.175 ry for the pz - sic method and -0.444 ry for a normal lda calculation .",
    "hence the current sic method is closer to a hartree fock description than lda or pz - sic .",
    "this finding is consistent with the discussion above that eqn.([effpot_new ] ) may be viewed as an approximation of the hartree - fock equation .",
    "the present sic method lowers the total energy compared to the method of perdew and zunger . for this reason it may not be as suitable for describing localization - delocalization transitions in the rare - earth metals , since the pz - sic method reproduces the mott transition in ce very well@xcite .",
    "however , since the pz - sic method does not remove all self interaction it would seem that the good description of this method in describing the localization - delocalization transitions in the rare - earths is somewhat fortuitous .    we also remark that as long as a hartree term ( which depends linearly on the electron density ) is introduced in the energy functional , any local xc functional @xmath54 which is a functional of the total density must also have a linear dependence on the electron density , if si is to be absent in the functional .    by construction",
    "the lda xc potential cancels some of the unphysical self interaction , e.g. in hydrogen 95@xmath55 of the self interaction@xcite is cancelled .",
    "application of the presented sic method to the hydrogen - atom would yield an exact result ( as would the pz - sic ) .",
    "since the application of pz - sic normally improves the lda result , we believe that the currently described method of sic will be successful when applied to systems like the 1-d hubbard model and the bandgap problem in nio , since it properly corrects for all self interaction . it may also be a good starting point for finding an exact xc functional of localized or nearly localized electron systems .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a novel way to perform sic - corrections in dft calculations , and compared it to an older , not fully si free , method . in its form the suggested correction is similar to the corrections of the non - spherical 4f density proposed by brooks _",
    "et al_. in calculations of crystal field excitations@xcite .",
    "the method presented is closer to the suggestion of nesbet@xcite and differs from the method of e.  g.  manoli _ et al_@xcite whose approximation is more similar to that of ref.@xcite .",
    "we have applied the new sic method to praseodymium metal and showed that it results in stronger localization of the f - shell , thus correcting more for self interaction . despite their large differences in describing the 4f electrons , the calculated equilibrium volumes of lda ,",
    "pz - sic and the presently proposed sic method are all quite similar and agree with the experimental values .",
    "this is a result of that the valence states ( that are not calculated using any sic potential ) are rather independent of the shape of the 4@xmath0-density and it is namely the valence states that are responsible for the chemical bonding . on the other hand ,",
    "the cohesive energy is better described by the new sic method , both compared to lda and to pz - sic .",
    "this project has been financed by the swedish natural science research council ( nfr ) .",
    "we are also thankful to sverker edvardson mitthgskolan , sundsvall for providing results from the hartree - fock calculations ."
