    ", the conventional analysis of the pn junction device under forward bias conditions follows closely shockley s original treatment [ 1 ] in which the diode equation is derived based on the injection and diffusion of minority carriers .",
    "there are , however , a number of paradoxes in the treatment of the subject matter in the present textbooks ( see below ) which tends to mislead the students . under zero and forward bias conditions , the pn junction displays a number of characteristic features with particular reference to carrier concentrations , exposed ionized dopants in the space charge layer ( scl ) or the depletion layer , internal field , @xmath0 in the scl , and the built - in voltage v@xmath1 . in a typical undergraduate course the arguments used in driving the diode equation",
    "follow a sequence of simplifying assumptions :    \\(a ) the depletion region or the scl ( space charge layer ) has a much higher resistance than the neutral regions so that the applied voltage drops across the depletion region .",
    "there is therefore no field in the neutral regions .",
    "\\(b ) the applied forward bias reduces the built - in potential v@xmath1 and allows the diffusion and hence injection of minority carriers . from assumption ( a )",
    ", the law of the junction gives the injected minority carrier concentration in terms of the applied voltage .",
    "for example for holes injected into the n - side ,    @xmath2    where p@xmath3(0 ) is the hole concentration just outside the depletion region , at the origin x=0 , p@xmath4 is the equilibrium hole concentration in the n - region , p@xmath4=n@xmath5/n@xmath6 , v is the applied bias , and the other symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "\\(c ) since the electric field in the neutral regions is assumed to be zero , the continuity equation for the minority carriers is greatly simplified and becomes analytically tractable even at the junior undergraduate level . for holes in the n - region , under steady state conditions , @xmath7p@xmath3/@xmath8t=0 and the continuity equation is simply    @xmath9    where j@xmath10 is the hole current density and @xmath11 is the minority carrier ( hole ) recombination time both in the n - region .",
    "it is tacitly assumed in eq.([eq2 ] ) that the minority carrier concentration is much less than the equilibrium majority carrier concentration so that a constant minority carrier lifetime can be defined which is independent of the majority carrier concentration , n@xmath3 .",
    "the hole current density however is simply the diffusion component as the electric field is assumed to be zero ,    @xmath12    where d@xmath10 is the diffusion coefficient of the minority carriers ( holes ) in the n - region .    substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , leads to    @xmath13    and solving eq.([eq4 ] ) for p@xmath3 one obtains , for a long diode ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15p@xmath3=p@xmath3-p@xmath4 is the excess minority carrier concentration and x is measured from just outside the depletion region .",
    "the long diode assumption means that the length of the neutral region , l@xmath3 , is much greater than the minority carrier diffusion length , l@xmath10 , defined as @xmath16 .",
    "the long diode assumption however is not necessary for the derivation of the diode equation ; it serves to simply the solution of eq.([eq4 ] ) to a single exponential rather than a hyperbolic sine function .    with the minority carrier concentration given as in eq.([eq5 ] ) , from eq.([eq3 ] ) the hole current density is    @xmath17    there is obviously a similar minority carrier diffusion current density in the p - region for the injected electrons , i.e.    @xmath18    where d@xmath19 and l@xmath19 are the electron diffusion coefficient and diffusion length , @xmath15n@xmath20 is the excess electrons concentration all in the p - region , and x is distance measured away from the depletion region in the p - side .",
    "\\(d ) it is assumed that the depletion region is so narrow that the currents do not vary across this region .",
    "then the majority carrier current at x=0 is the same as the minority carrier current at x=0 .",
    "similarly the majority carrier current at x=0 is the same as the minority carrier current at x=0 .",
    "thus the total current density is    @xmath21    and using the law of the junction for @xmath15p@xmath3(0 ) and @xmath22n@xmath20(0 ) from eq.[eq1 ] one obtains the diode equation ,    @xmath23    or    @xmath24   \\left ( { { \\rm{exp}}(\\frac{{ev}}{{kt } } )   -   1 } \\right ) \\label{eq10}\\ ] ]    this is the general diode equation found in the majority of textbooks which follow the above sequence of steps , either through tacitly or explicitly stated assumptions in ( a ) to ( d ) .",
    "many texts , for simplicity , consider either the p@xmath25n or the n@xmath25p junction .",
    "for the p@xmath25n junction , @xmath26 and eq.(11 ) becomes ,    @xmath27   \\left ( { { \\rm{exp}}(\\frac{{ev}}{{kt } } )   -   1 } \\right ) \\label{eq11}\\ ] ]    the assumption stated explicitly in ( d ) is commonly overlooked in many current textbooks on the subject and is one of the key assumptions in the derivation of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) as discussed , for example , by moloney @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq2 ] ) gives the impression that the conduction process in the p@xmath25n junction diode is the diffusion of injected holes in the n - region .",
    "the above steps invariably lead to a conclusion for the student that it is the minority carrier diffusion which constitutes the forward current .",
    "close examination of the above steps in the derivation exposes a number of serious pedagogical paradoxes and problems for the student and the instructor . the diode equation in eq .",
    "[ eq11 ] is so entrenched in our teaching of the pn junction that it has been used to design many simple but fruitful laboratory experiments as reported in various journals .",
    "the conventional undergraduate level treatment in section i leads to a number of pedagogical problems and paradoxes .",
    "we cite those we have encountered frequently in two undergraduate classes during the treatment of the forward biased long diode :    \\(a ) if there is no field in the neutral region then there can be no net charge at any point in this region inasmuch as @xmath28 .",
    "then the excess majority carrier concentration should follow the decay of the excess minority carrier concentration , @xmath15n@xmath3(x)=@xmath15p@xmath3(x ) , which then follows eq .",
    "but the gradients of @xmath22n@xmath3(x)=@xmath15p@xmath3(x ) along x must be the same as well .",
    "therefore majority carriers diffuse towards the right as well and since in silicon @xmath29 , and electrons are negatively charged the net current is actually in the reverse direction .",
    "the current must be in the opposite direction to the applied voltage !",
    "\\(b ) the minority carrier current , which is due to diffusion , decays with x. since the total current must be constant , the majority carrier current must increase with x. however , there is no field in the neutral region which means that electrons must diffuse .",
    "from the first paradox above this diffusion can not make up for the decay in the hole current .",
    "\\(c ) far away from the depletion region , both the hole and electron concentrations are almost uniform .",
    "if there is no electric field , then the current , due to diffusion , must vanish .",
    "how is it that the current stays constant in the neutral region ( indeed in the whole device ) ?",
    "\\(d ) the absence of an electric field in the neutral region means that @xmath15n@xmath3(x)=@xmath15p@xmath3(x ) .",
    "but when holes are injected into the n - region they recombine with electrons so that , intuitively , the majority carrier concentration should decrease not increase .",
    "the concept of field free neutral regions is so deeply rooted in the present treatment that many authors do indeed show the excess majority carrier concentration increasing towards the junction like the excess minority carrier concentration .",
    "this fact alone is contrary to student intuition that , if anything , the excess majority concentration should remain uniform .",
    "it is clear that the instructor has a responsibility to clear this paradox .",
    "it is interesting to note that a large number of authors sketch the carrier concentration profiles with the majority carrier concentration shown as uniform whereas others show the excess majority carrier profile following the excess minority carrier concentration profile as indicated in table i for a survey of a large number of books on the subject .",
    "the differences in the diagrams only add confusion to the student s understanding .",
    "few authors allude to the presence of the electric field and majority carrier drift to overcome some of the problems listed above .",
    "there is however no satisfactory treatment in the majority of the textbooks used in english speaking countries we have examined as illustrated in table i. in most books the field in the neutral region is totally neglected in the treatment .",
    "the result , we believe , is pedagogical paradoxes and a student who is confused .",
    "it seems that only some of the early books published in the sixties consider the need and the effects of the field in the neutral regions in their discussion of conduction in the forward biased pn junction .",
    "for simplicity we consider a long p@xmath25n junction diode . equation ( [ eq2 ] ) describes its conventional current - voltage characteristics .",
    "we use the parameters listed in table 2 which represent `` typical '' parameters for a p@xmath30n junction si diode albeit classroom parameters .",
    "we also assume small injection so that @xmath31 ( or n@xmath32 .",
    "the latter assumption means that the minority carrier recombination time remains a useful parameter . for forward bias",
    "we take the voltage across the diode to be typically 0.55v .",
    "the depletion region extends essentially into the n - side and its width w , is much shorter than the hole diffusion length in this region as indicated in table ii .",
    "similarly the relatively tiny extension of the depletion width into the p@xmath25region is much shorter than the electron diffusion length there .",
    "lengths of the neutral regions are taken to be about ten times their minority carrier diffusion lengths to represent a `` long - diode '' , i.e. l@xmath3=10l@xmath33 and l@xmath20=10l@xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35    the first attempt to overcome the problems listed in section ii is to allow some of the applied voltage , a small fraction of it , to drop across the neutral n - region of the p@xmath25-n junction .",
    "this is easily accepted by the student since the neutral regions must have some finite resistance even though much smaller than the depletion region .",
    "this means that the law of the junction remains approximately valid .",
    "what is the field in the n - region ?    the total current through the p@xmath25n junction must be continuous .",
    "this means that at any point in the n - region ,    @xmath36    where e@xmath3 is the field in the n - region at x. initially e@xmath3 is assumed to be small but finite .    since @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( small injection ) , and @xmath15n@xmath3(x)=@xmath15p@xmath3(x ) the above equation simplifies to ,    @xmath39    the requirement of an internal field is quite transparent from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the minority concentration gradient is negative and @xmath40 which means that the first term in eq.([eq3 ] ) is negative so that current is in the negative direction .",
    "unless there is an internal field drifting the majority carriers it is not possible to obtain a positive current .",
    "the pedagogic development at this point must make use of the excess minority carrier concentration in eq.[eq5 ] .",
    "if the field is indeed sufficiently small it may be assumed that the excess minority carrier profile , @xmath22p@xmath3(x ) , is still given by eq.[eq5 ] .",
    "the validity of this assumption will be demonstrated below with an illustrative example .",
    "one can also assume that eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) can still be used to describe the total diode current . then from eqs .",
    "[ eq5 ] , [ eq2 ] and [ eq3 ] , one can obtain the field e@xmath3 in the n - region    @xmath41 \\label{eq15}\\ ] ]    where we have used the definition b@xmath42/@xmath43=d@xmath44/d@xmath45 .",
    "equation ( [ eq4 ] ) describes the field outside the scl in the so - called neutral region that is needed to maintain the diode current . in the n - region",
    "the field increases towards the scl .",
    "the increase in the field is required to make up for the negative electron diffusion current . far away from the depletion region",
    "the current is maintained by a constant field of magnitude ,    @xmath46 \\label{eq16}\\ ] ]    an interesting feature is that the magnitude of the field increases exponentially with the applied voltage contrary to student intuition based on the applied voltage simply dividing between the resistance of the depletion region and the resistance of the neutral region .    with the field given in eq.[eq15 ]",
    "a paradox mentioned in section ii develops in that e varies spatially across the neutral region so that @xmath47 is not zero .",
    "gauss equation in point form ( or the poisson equation ) in the n - region is :    @xmath48    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the total permittivity of si ( = @xmath51 .    since @xmath15p@xmath3(x ) is determined by eq.[eq5 ] , the excess majority carrier concentration is :    @xmath52 = \\delta p_n ( x ) \\left [ { 1 + \\frac{{\\varepsilon ( b_n   - 1)kt}}{{e^2 b_n n_d l_{hn}^2 } } } \\right ] \\label{eq19}\\ ] ]    substituting typical values for @xmath50 , b@xmath3 , n@xmath53 , l@xmath10 from table ii into eq.([eq2 ] ) shows that the second term is @xmath544.1x10@xmath55 .",
    "thus @xmath15n@xmath3(x)=@xmath15p@xmath3(x ) and the charge neutrality condition for all practical purposes remains valid .",
    "we have found the requirement of @xmath15n@xmath3(x)=@xmath15p@xmath3(x ) to be somewhat contrary to student intuition .",
    "this is further exasperated by many texts showing the majority carrier concentration uniform in the neutral regions ( see table i ) which misleads the student .",
    "qualitatively , the injected holes into the n - region disturb the charge neutrality and set - up a field here which then drives the electrons towards the scl until a steady state is reached between electron drift and diffusion .",
    "thus the increase in the majority carrier concentration towards the scl is due to the driving effect of the field , e@xmath3 , even though it appears at first that @xmath15n@xmath3 should decrease towards thescl as injected holes recombine with electrons    once the field in the n - region is given as eq.[eq15 ] , the student can readily calculate the various contributions to the total current density using eq.[eq13 ] . the magnitudes of the various current components ( majority carrier diffusion and drift , and minority carrier diffusion and drift ) and their directions are listed in table ii . in general , the _ drift of the majority carriers is the most significant contribution to the pn junction diode current .",
    "_ how is then the diffusion terminology comes to appear in explaining the diode current even though the biggest contribution is drift ?    given that the depletion region is very narrow and that recombination in this region is negligibly small due to the very small concentrations of carriers , then in the steady state one must have @xmath56 and the electron current j@xmath34 must be constant through the scl .",
    "but , electron drift at x=0 , i.e minority carrier drift , is negligible and the electron current there is primarily a diffusion current just like the hole current in the n - region .",
    "thus the total electron current at x=0 must equal to the electron diffusion current at x=0 .",
    "similarly the hole diffusion current at x=0 is equal to the total hole current at x=0 which is essentially by drift .",
    "it is apparent that by evaluating the _ minority carrier diffusion current just outside depletion region we are indirectly determining the total majority carrier current at the other side of the depletion region_. this is a subtle point that seems to have been short circuited in the majority of the texts .",
    "consequently , the diode equation stated in equation ( 10 ) is only valid if the scl width is much shorter than the minority carrier diffusion length in that region    an important paradox that must be addressed by the instructor is the much cherished minority carrier concentration profile stated in eq.[eq5 ] for a long diode .",
    "equation [ eq5 ] is the solution of the continuity equation in the absence of an electric field . as a first step one can assume a constant field , e@xmath3 , in the neutral region to examine its effects on the excess minority carrier concentration profile",
    ". in the presence of a constant field , the general continuity equation in eq.[eq2 ] leads to    @xmath57    since this is a linear differential equation , the undergraduate student can readily solve it or accept its solution by substituting the solution into eq.([eq3 ] ) . for a long neutral region ,",
    "the solution is :    @xmath58    where a@xmath3 is a `` length constant '' which can be determined by substituting eq.([eq4 ] ) into ( [ eq3 ] ) ;    @xmath59    solving this quadratic equation we find ,    @xmath60 =   l_{hn } \\left [ { \\sqrt { \\alpha _",

    "the field is maximum at x=0 , and using this maximum value one finds @xmath61=0.00106 and a@xmath3=(1.0011)l@xmath10 . at v=0.65v , a@xmath3=(1.05)l@xmath10 and",
    "a@xmath3 is still very close to l@xmath69(within 5% ) even though the injected hole concentration is now only ten times smaller than the equilibrium majority concentration which sets the limit of small injection .",
    "although the solution in eq.([eq3 ] ) does not apply when the field is non - uniform as in eq.[eq15 ] , it does nonetheless provide convenient means for the student to examine the possible effect of the field on the excess minority carrier profile .",
    "the field in the p - region can be similarly derived .",
    "the total current in the p@xmath25 region is    @xmath70    since the total current must be constant and assigned to be described by eq .",

    "we assumed that , as usual under forward bias , @xmath75 .",
    "equation ( [ eq9 ] ) shows that the field is minimum right at the scl , x=0 , and increases exponentially to a constant value away from the junction . substituting typical values from table ii",

    "most interestingly and importantly , even though e@xmath20 is even smaller than e@xmath3 , its effect is most significant .",
    "one readily can calculate the contributions of each term to the current density in the p - region from eq .",
    "the values at the scl are listed in table ii where it is apparent that the current is carried almost totally by _",
    "majority carrier drift_. a distinctly different behavior in the p@xmath25-region from that observed in the n - region is the fact that the majority carrier diffusion is insignificant and that minority carrier diffusion , though larger than majority diffusion , is some three orders of magnitude smaller than majority carrier drift . from the above discussion for conduction on the n - side it is clear that in deriving the diode equation we are calculating the hole ( majority ) drift current in the p@xmath25-region by evaluating the hole ( minority ) diffusion current in the n - region simply because the total hole current does not change through the scl as long as the latter is thinner than the hole diffusion length .",
    "it is always useful for the student to reconfirm that the majority of the voltage drops across the depletion region by evaluating the voltage drop across the neutral regions .",
    "if v@xmath3 is the voltage drop across the n - region then    @xmath77    or    @xmath78    equation ( [ eq2 ] ) shows that the voltage drops increases exponentially with the applied bias contrary to an intuitive guess . using typical values , at v=0.55v",

    "v@xmath3 becomes 0.121v which is quite significant but at this bias voltage the injected hole concentration is no longer small compared with n@xmath53 .",
    "there is a clear indication that as the voltage across the diode increases more and more of the applied voltage drops across the neutral regions which deteriorates the law of the junction .",

    "+ recognizing the difficulty due to the presence of the space - charge layer , a standard way to find a valid solution is to treat the boundary layer separately from the rest of the diode . in spite of the success of this approach @xcite , one might feel uneasy about this artificial dichotomy and rather tackle the problem with new powerful mathematical / numerical methods that handle the layer and the rest of the device on the same equal footing .",
