    "hence , there is a simple relation between the measurable size of the halo and the simple poles of the pad approximation .    in the cases shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] the leading order halo is below the typical instrument s resolution of @xmath160 . instead",
    ", the next - to - leading - order root will determine the size of the halo . in general",
    ", we hence define the size of the leading ( observable ) halo as @xmath161 for our test spectrum we show the parameter @xmath162 in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] for various magnetic field strengths and @xmath0-ray energies between @xmath163  gev to a few tev . as before we consider a coherence length of @xmath96  mpc .",
    "the size of the halo in this energy range follows approximately @xmath164 as the fit shows .",
    "this agrees with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite ( fig .  7 ) derived from a monte - carlo study .",
    "another interesting situation occurs if the cascaded @xmath0-ray spectrum dominates over the primary @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "this can happen for injection spectra that are considerably harder than @xmath165 . in this case",
    "the detection sensitivity of the cascaded gev - tev spectrum depends on the size of the halo and the resolution of the telescope . as an example we consider the emission of the blazar source 1es0229 + 200 located at redshift @xmath151 , which has been detected by its tev @xmath0-ray emission by h.e.s.s .",
    "the spectrum is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] as the blue data .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we model the @xmath0-ray emission spectrum as @xmath152 ( thin gray line ) .",
    "the surviving primary @xmath0-rays are shown as a dashed green line and secondary cascaded @xmath0-rays by a solid line .",
    "it is easy to understand the shape of the various spectra .",
    "primary @xmath0-rays close to @xmath166 interact with the cib to produce electron / positron pairs .",
    "this is a slow process happening on typical scales of the order of a few 100  mpc ( see left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the leptons quickly lose energy via ics with cmb photons at a rate @xmath167 ; their spectrum in quasi - equilibrium ( @xmath168 ) follows the differential equation @xmath169 .",
    "thus , the comptonized electron spectrum for @xmath170 has the form @xmath171 .",
    "the typical photon energy from ics of a background photon with energy @xmath48 is given by @xmath172 .",
    "the resulting photon spectrum at @xmath170 follows from energy conservation in ics , @xmath173 . the plateau of the full cascaded spectrum shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] is slightly softer than this since a part of the inverse - compton spectrum is still above pair - production threshold and enters a second cascade cycle .",
    "we also show the expected contribution of secondary @xmath0-rays confined within the psf of a typical iact with @xmath160 assuming an igmf with coherence length @xmath96  mpc and strength @xmath153 , @xmath95 and @xmath174  g , respectively .",
    "the deflection of an electron of the comptonized spectrum is approximately @xmath175 following from @xmath176 and @xmath171 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of our diffusion ansatz since the first moment of the electron / positron distribution follows @xmath177 . if the typical deflection @xmath178 exceeds @xmath179 we expect to see a reduction in the point - source flux by a geometric factor @xmath180 . for ics in the cmb",
    "the transition is expected to occur close to the energy @xmath181 this agrees well with the reduced cascade flux ( `` @xmath182 '' ; dotted lines ) shown in the plot .",
    "before we conclude we would like to emphasize a subtlety concerning the contribution of the cib in ics . as can be seen from the summary of interaction / loss lengths in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , the contribution of the cib to the total energy loss of ics is negligible .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum @xmath17 is hence almost independent of this contribution , but this is not the case for the higher moments @xmath183 . to see this , let us consider a fully comptonized electron / positron spectrum @xmath171 .",
    "following our previous arguments we have @xmath184 for the comptonized electron spectrum .",
    "the growth of the deflection is hence proportional to @xmath185 and optical photons are expected to contribute much stronger than cmb photons .",
    "however , the fraction of photons that contribute with this large deflection is negligible .",
    "inverse - compton scattering by the cib will form a shallow plateau of @xmath0-rays that are negligible for the calculation of the moments of the central halo from the cmb contribution .",
    "we can hence neglect this contribution in the calculation of moments which improves the quality of the halo reconstruction at low @xmath5 .",
    "we have discussed a novel technique of calculating extended halos of tev @xmath0-ray sources in the presence of intergalactic magnetic fields . the method builds on standard cascade equations that account for all particle interactions with the background radiation and treats the effect of secondary electron / positron deflections in intervening magnetic fields by a diffusion ansatz .",
    "the moments of the angular distribution can be calculated efficiently by an extended set of cascade equations .",
    "the first moments of the distribution already serve as a good estimator of the halo size .",
    "we have shown how the full distribution can be reconstructed from further moments via an inverse laplace transformation of the moment s generating function using pad approximations .",
    "our method applies to situations where the emission of @xmath0-rays is isotropic or within a sufficiently large jet opening - angle .",
    "the @xmath0-ray halo is expected to show further structure in the more general case .",
    "for instance , @xmath0-ray emission into narrow jets are expected to produce additional breaks in the halo profile  @xcite and non - spherical geometries in the case of an off - axes emission  @xcite . for the illustration of the method",
    "we have considered a steady @xmath0-ray emission . in the case of pulsed or short - lived @xmath0-ray sources",
    "there will be a time - delay between primary and secondary @xmath0-rays due to the increased path length of the leptons .",
    "this can also serve as a measure for the intergalactic magnetic field .",
    "this work is supported by us national science foundation grant no phy-0969739 and by the research foundation of suny at stony brook .",
    "we assume in the following that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the line - of - sight of the source . in this",
    "setup electrons and positrons will be deflected by an angle @xmath5 in a plane normal to the magnetic field .",
    "for isotropic emission and small deflections the leptons deflected off the line - of - sight are replenished by leptons initially streaming away from the observer .",
    "the net effect is a broadening of the @xmath5-distribution ( @xmath186 ) due to a convection term with opposite sign for electrons ( @xmath187 ) and positrons ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the transport equations take the form @xmath189 the evolution equation of the total electron / positron cascade @xmath190 can then be written as @xmath191\\,,\\label{eq : masterregular}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with an effective source term @xmath192 for @xmath193 we can make the replacement @xmath194 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : masterregular ] ) reduces to @xmath195\\,.\\ ] ] we can further simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : master2 ] ) by introducing the mean inelasticity , @xmath196 the inelasticity of ics off cmb photons for electron / positron energies below about @xmath163  tev is small and we can hence approximate the differential interaction rate by @xmath197 . using this in eq .",

    "generalizing to two angular variables @xmath201 in the plane orthogonal to the line - of - sight we start with @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the direction of the lorentz force projected into the @xmath204-plane .",
    "from here we arrive at @xmath205 - \\gamma_e(e ) { \\mathcal y}_e(e , t,\\vec\\theta ) + \\mathcal{l}_e^{\\rm eff}(e , t,\\vec\\theta)\\\\&+\\int_0^t{\\rm d}t'e^{-\\gamma_e(e)(t - t')}\\int_e{\\rm d}e'\\gamma_{ee}(e',e)\\bigg[\\dot   { \\mathcal y}_e(e',t',\\vec\\theta)+ \\gamma_e(e ' ) { \\mathcal y}_e(e',t',\\vec\\theta ) -\\mathcal{l}_e^{\\rm eff}(e',t',\\vec\\theta)\\bigg]\\,.\\label{eq : masterrandom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the evaluation of the second time integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : masterrandom ] ) we can proceed as in the case of a regular magnetic field . however , in the first integral we have to account for the fluctuations of @xmath206 over the inverse compton scattering length .",
    "these will average to zero except for @xmath207 and we hence substitute @xmath208 .",
    "averaging over the orientation of the magnetic field can be accounted for by an additional factor @xmath82 .",
    "proceeding now along the same steps as in the case of a regular field and replacing the angles @xmath209 by spherical coordinates with radius @xmath5 we arrive at the diffusion term  ( [ eq : diffrandom ] ) with diffusion matrix  ( [ eq : drandom ] ) .",
    "we start from the boltzmann equations ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) and ( [ eq : thetanevol ] ) and define discrete values @xmath210 , @xmath211 , etc .",
    "the combined effect of transitions and deflections within the cascade during a sufficiently small time - step @xmath212 can be described by @xmath213 the full cascade solution is then given by @xmath214 the @xmath215 matrizes @xmath216 and @xmath217 follow the recursive relation @xmath218 where the non - zero initial conditions are @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "the matrices @xmath222 and @xmath223 are the familiar transfer matrices for electro - magnetic cascades in the presence of a source term . using the recursion relations ( [ eq : rec1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rec2 ] ) we can efficiently calculate the matrices @xmath224 and @xmath225 via matrix - doubling  @xcite .",
