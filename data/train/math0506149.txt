    "one of the central philosophical points of modern differential geometry is in the idea that the existence of special metrics should imply strong geometric conditions on the manifold .",
    "an important example of special metrics are the extremal metrics of a khler manifold , introduced by calabi @xcite . by definition",
    "extremal khler metrics of a positive @xmath2-cohomology class are khler metrics with minimal @xmath3-norm of the scalar curvature with respect to all khler metrics in the same @xmath2-cohomology class .",
    "calabi proved ( see @xcite ) that extremal metrics are exactly the khler metrics with holomorphic gradient of the scalar curvature . to any positive @xmath2-cohomology class calabi and futaki",
    "@xcite associated an invariant such that its vanishing implies that the extremal metrics of the given class are exactly the metrics with constant scalar curvature .",
    "moreover the vanishing of the calabi - futaki invariant is a necessary condition for the existence of metrics with constant scalar curvature . in the case of fano manifolds ,",
    "a positive multiple of the first chern class admits a metric with constant scalar curvature if and only if the khler metric is einstein .",
    "the problem of existence of khler - einstein metrics over fano manifolds has been the subject of intense study over the last two decades .",
    "inspired from the work of donaldson , mabuchi introduced the k - energy functional @xcite . in a joint work with bando , @xcite they proved that the existence of a khler - einstein metric implies a lower bound of the k - energy and the uniqueness of the khler - einstein metric modulo the action of automorphisms of the manifold .",
    "recently it has been shown by chen and tian @xcite that the existence of an extremal metric in a given class implies the lower boundedness of the k - energy and the uniqueness of the extremal metric modulo the action of automorphisms . in the special case of a multiple of the first chern class we have a very powerfull tool which is the khler - ricci flow . using a similar computation as in @xcite",
    "it can be proved ( see @xcite ) that the khler - ricci flow admit always a solution for all times . in @xcite cao proved that the solution converges to a khler - einstein metric if the first chern class is non positive . in this way he re - proved the celebrated calabi - yau theorem @xcite . in the case of fano",
    "manifolds the khler - ricci flow does not allways converge , in fact there are fano manifolds which do not admit khler - einstein metrics @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite chen and tian",
    "give a proof which shows that the existence of a khler - einstein metric over a fano manifold with nonnegative bisectional curvature implies the convergence of the khler - ricci flow .",
    "their hypothesis on the nonnegativity of the bisectional curvature is just a temporary technical assumption .",
    "what they really need is that the positivity of the ricci tensor is preserved under the khler - ricci flow . in order to prove the convergence chen and tian introduced in @xcite a family of energy functionals @xmath4 . until now , only @xmath5 and @xmath1 plays a key role in the convergence of the khler - ricci flow .",
    "the functional @xmath5 is just the k - energy .",
    "one of the crucial points of their proof is that , over khler - einstein manifolds admiting a metric @xmath6 such that the nonegativity of the ricci tensor is preserved under the khler - ricci flow with initial metric @xmath6 , the energy functional @xmath1 is lower bounded from below ( so bounded ) under the flow .",
    "in fact the energy functional @xmath1 is always decreasing along the flows which preserve a certain uniform lower bound of the ricci tensors of the evolved metrics . very recently",
    "song and weinkove @xcite have answered a question of chen @xcite , showing that over khler - einstein manifolds the energy functional @xmath1 is bounded on the full space of potentials .",
    "we have the following general result .",
    "let @xmath7 be a fano manifold such that the k - energy functional of the canonical class @xmath8 is bounded from below .",
    "then the chen - tian energy functional @xmath1 of the canonical class @xmath8 is allso bounded from below .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath9 be a polarised fano manifold with @xmath10 and let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be respectively the the k - energy and the chen - tian energy functionals with reference metric @xmath13 .",
    "then there exist a constant @xmath14 depending only on @xmath13 such that for any khler - ricci flow @xmath15 we have the inequality @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "we consider it necessary to write this note because our proof of theorem 2 is drastically simple",
    ". moreover there are indications that our result will be usefull for a new existence criteria of khler - einstein metrics .",
