    "this effect arises when cmb photons streaming across the dark energy dominated universe interact with the decaying gravitational potential wells associated with the foreground lss .",
    "this interaction imprints a secondary anisotropy on the primordial cmb spectrum at large scales and it can be used to probe the nature of dark energy .",
    "current models of dark energy include a cosmological constant ( @xmath2 ) , with constant energy density filling space homogeneously , and dynamical scalar field models , such as quintessence , whose energy density varies with time and space . although the current concordance model , involving @xmath2 and cold dark matter in an frw universe ( @xmath2cdm ) , is consistent with all observations , scalar field models can not be _ a priori _ excluded .",
    "in fact , the small ( but non - vanishing ) value observed for the dark energy density ( @xmath3 ) allows the possibility of studying dynamical models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a common way of describing de models is through its equation of state parameter , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the pressure and @xmath6 is the energy density .",
    "the cosmological constant model corresponds specifically to @xmath7 , whereas a value of @xmath8 is associated with dynamical models .",
    "the equation of state parameter affects both the evolution of density fluctuations and the background expansion of the universe .",
    "another characteristic that defines the nature of a general matter component is its effective sound speed , @xmath9 . for a perfect fluid with adiabatic perturbations",
    "there is a simple relation between the background and the sound speed : @xmath10 . in imperfect fluids , like scalar field models of de , however , dissipative processes generate entropic perturbations , and the sound speed is given by the more general relation : @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the sound speed of de energy thus affects the growth of density perturbations .",
    "both the equation of state parameter and the sound speed determine the clustering properties of the de fluid .",
    "single scalar field models , or quintessence , are characterised by having a speed of sound very close to the speed of light , and de clustering is determined by @xmath12 alone , occurring only on scales equal to or larger than the horizon size @xcite . for alternative sound speed models , with @xmath13 ( in units of the speed of light , @xmath14 ) , de clusters on sub - horizon scales which are determined by the value of @xmath15 .",
    "an example is the scalar field model named k - essence , characterised by having a non - standard form of kinetic energy with an evolving sound speed @xcite .",
    "the isw effect presents itself as a probe of the properties of de @xcite and several groups have provided new ways of constraining the de parameters using the cross - correlation between the cmb and different lss surveys ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we present the prospects of constraining the properties of de by using an hi - galaxy survey that may be attainable with the future square kilometre array ( ska ) radio telescope using the isw effect in cross - correlation and the hi - galaxy autocorrelation .",
    "in particular , we investigate the prospects for detection of a de speed of sound different to that of quitessence ( i.  e. , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in  [ sec : theory ] we give an overview of the theory of the isw effect describing the effects of the de parameters on the isw  galaxy and galaxy - galaxy power spectra . in  [ sec : ska ] we introduce and discuss the properties of a model ska hi redshift distribution and the impact on isw experiments . in section ",
    "[ sec : method ] we deal with the numerical implementation of the theory , the signal - to - noise calculations and the forecast for model detection .",
    "finally , the results are presented and discussed in  [ sec : results ] , and they are summarised in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "fluctuations in the matter distribution of the large - scale structure can be expressed in terms of the projected fractional source count of the mass tracer @xmath17 where _",
    "b@xmath18 _ is the linear bias parameter of an hi - galaxy population , @xmath19 is the matter density contrast ( @xmath20 ) , and @xmath21 is the normalised redshift distribution of hi galaxies .    on the other hand , the temperature fluctuations arising from the isw effect are expressed as the change in gravitational potential over conformal time ( or comoving distance ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the newtonian gravitational potential , @xmath24 is the comoving distance running from today to the epoch of de - coupling and the dot represents derivatives with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "the amplitude of the galaxy  temperature cross - correlation for each mode in fourier space is thus given as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the matter power spectrum per logarithmic interval of wave number ( @xmath27 ) today and @xmath28 .",
    "the filter functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ cross ] ) correspond to the hi - survey and isw spectrum respectively .",
    "the amount of cross - correlation signal will depend on both the distribution of the galaxy selection function and the change of the gravitational potential with time .",
    "this dependency is manifested through the two filter functions which are defined as integrals over redshift weighted by spherical bessel functions , @xmath31 , as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the value of the hubble constant today and @xmath34 is the matter density today in units of critical .",

    "( [ deltam ] ) is usually rewritten as a function of the linear growth factor , @xmath45 , and can be solved numerically to compute , for example , the power spectra in the above equations for each @xmath12 model .",
    "more generally , the introduction of de perturbations , characterised by @xmath46 , also has an impact on the evolution of cdm overdensities .",
    "this effect is , however , less significant for smaller @xmath12 and it vanishes as @xmath47 ( in fact , it is only in this limit when one could safely neglect de perturbations ) . in the synchronous gauge @xcite , the evolution of the density and velocity perturbation of a general matter component ( denoted by subscript _ i _ ) in the frame comoving with the de ( denoted by the circumflex ) is given by @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the conformal hubble parameter , @xmath50 is the velocity and @xmath51 is the synchronous metric perturbation @xcite . as shown in @xcite , the effect of increasing the sound speed of the dark energy is to reduce the growth of structure resulting in an increased isw signal on the largest scales . on the other hand ,",
    "as @xmath46 decreases , cdm perturbations larger than the de sound horizon collapse , and the isw effect is reduced .",
    "( [ evoldens ] ) and ( [ evolvel ] ) show how density perturbations are fully characterised by both @xmath12 and @xmath46 .",
    "the solution to these equations can be obtained numerically , provided that we know these two parameters . in this work",
    ", we will consider these to be constants , as justified in @xcite and references therein , although the formalism can be easily adapted for evolving models of dark energy .",
    "direct observation of hi emission from neutral atomic hydrogen at high redshift is limited by the poor sensitivity of current radio telescopes .",
    "direct detections have been only achieved up to redshift @xmath52 @xcite , and hi gas at higher redshift has only been probed through the absorption in the quasar optical spectra by damped - ly@xmath53 ( dla ) systems , in which the bulk of the neutral gas in the universe at high redshift is believed to be contained @xcite .",
    "the ska will have an unprecedented sensitivity provided by its large collecting area , as well as a large ( @xmath54 deg@xmath55 ) instantaneous field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the telescope s high sensitivity will allow the detection of hi galaxies located at redshifts that include the beginning of de domination era , @xmath56 0.51 , and beyond .",
    "this will provide an opportunity to map the sky in different redshifts slices ( redshift tomography ) , and therefore to constrain more accurately the value and evolution of the de parameters .",
    "in addition to a fast surveying capability , an extended fov will also provide a very wide survey area ( almost the entire sky ) which is needed to probe the largest scales required by an isw experiment .",
    "all the above will result in the detection of a large number of sources which will reduce statistic errors greatly , and will provide measurements of cross - correlation and galaxy autocorrelation with large signal - to - noise .",
    "our current knowledge of the expected hi galaxy redshift distribution is very limited .",

    "the hi mass function inside this integral is very likely to evolve with redshift due to the fact that the content of neutral hydrogen is affected by many astrophysical process such as star formation , supernova explosions , etc .",
