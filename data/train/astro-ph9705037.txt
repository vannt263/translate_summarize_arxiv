    "interstellar dust consists mainly of heavy elements .",
    "therefore a relation between the dust - to - gas ratio and the metallicity of a galaxy can be expected .",
    "the simplest argument to derive this dependence comes from franco & cox ( 1986 ) : the authors suggest that the dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath1 , is simply @xmath6 , the metallicity of the gas",
    ". however , this assumption might be too simplistic .",
    "furthermore , the dust - to - gas ratio might be expected to depend on the star formation rate .",
    "dwek & scalo ( 1980 ) have shown that dust injection from supernovae dominates other sources , if indeed grains can form and survive in the ejecta .",
    "this has become clear after the sn1987a event , in which dust has been unambiguously detected ( moseley 1989 , kosaza , hasegawa & nomoto 1989 ) .",
    "indeed , the bulk of the refractory elements ( characterized by higher melting temperatures , such as si , mg , fe , ca , ti , al etc . ) is injected into the ism by supernovae ( mckee 1989 ) .",
    "dust can be destroyed by interstellar shocks : small grains are destroyed by thermal sputtering in fast non - radiative shocks ; large grains are destroyed by grain - grain collisions and eroded by non - thermal sputtering in radiative shocks ( jones 1994 , borkowski & dwek 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , dust grains might be expelled from the galaxy either by radiation pressure ( ferrara 1991 ) or convected away by a fountain - like flow ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) . from these arguments",
    ", it follows that the dust content of a galaxy is clearly governed by supernovae , and therefore the equilibrium established between the formation and destruction processes could be influenced by the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate these processes . as a first step we want to ascertain empirically the existence of a relation between the dust - to - gas ratio , metallicity and the star formation activity .",
    "the results are used to constrain a model for the dust production taking into account the processes described above .",
    "we have selected dwarf galaxies as objects for this study .",
    "the reason is twofold : ( i ) the metallicities observed in these objects span a large range of values ; ( ii ) due to their small size and simple structure , radial gradients in the dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity can be neglected .",
    "both features make them suitable objects for a comparison of the dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity .",
    "the knowledge of the dust content in dwarf galaxies is also relevant to cosmological studies as dwarfs represent the most numerous population of galaxies .",
    "thus , their dust content could have important implications , e.g. for the obscuration of qsos .",
    "detailed studies of the extinction properties of the magellanic clouds have revealed a clear relation between the dust - to - gas ratio and the metal abundance : in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) both the metallicity and the dust - to - gas ratio are roughly a factor 4 lower than in the galaxy ( koornneef 1982 ; fitzpatrick 1986 ) and in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , where the metallicity is a factor of about 10 lower than in the galaxy , also the dust - to - gas ratio is a factor of 8 - 11 lower ( bouchet 1985 ) .",
    "so far only few studies have investigated the relation between the dust - to - gas ratio and the metallicity for a large number of galaxies .",
    "issa , maclaren & wolfendale ( 1990 ) have compared the dust - to - gas ratio and the metallicities in the galaxy and 6 nearby galaxies and found evidence for a correlation , with the two quantities decreasing at roughly the same rate with increasing galactocentric radius .",
    "when taking both quantities at a fixed radius they also obtained a good correlation , following @xmath7 .",
    "schmidt & boller ( 1993 ) have compared the dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity of 23 nearby dwarf galaxies and found that the oxygen abundance is @xmath8 , hence in good agreement with issa ( 1990 ) .    in the present work we have compiled data for dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies and blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies from the literature and studied the relation between the dust and metal abundance and the star formation rate . for the dirr sample",
    "we confirm the existence of a correlation which is clearly non - linear whereas for the bcd sample no significant correlation could be found .",
    "these results allow a theoretical insight on the physics that governs the metal and dust production and on global galactic properties such as the star formation and mass loss history .",
    "we divide the dwarf galaxies in our study into two subsamples : one sample contains dirr galaxies and the other sample consists of bcds . in the dirr sample",
    "we include all galaxies of morphological type s(b)m or i(b)m without applying a , in any case arbitrary , luminosity cutoff .",
    "the reason for distinguishing between dirrs and bcds is their different recent star formation history : bcds possess spectra very similar to hii  regions , and they are believed to be undergoing a starburst .",
    "this variable , intense star formation rate in the recent past could affect the relation between the dust and metal abundance , as the time scale for a starburst ( @xmath9 years ) is comparable to the time scales relevant for the dust and metal production which is given by the life time of massive stars .",
    "most of the dirrs , on the other hand , are not in such an extremely intense star forming phase .    in tab . 1 and 2",
    "the data for the samples are listed .",
    "the sample of dirrs consists of 28 galaxies .",
    "the sample size was mainly constrained by the availability of metallicity data .",
    "the oxygen abundances , which were chosen as a tracer for the metallicity , were taken from a compilation of skillman , kennicutt & hodge ( 1989 ) , hunter , gallagher & rautenkranz ( 1982 ) ( corrected according to mcgaugh 1991 ) , campbell , terlevich & melnick ( 1986 ) and schmidt & boller ( 1993 ) .",
    "the latter authors did a similar study to the present one ; their sample contains 23 dirr galaxies and is a subsample of ours .",
    "the rest of the data ( far - infrared ( fir ) flux , distance , blue luminosity , hi  mass , optical diameter ) were taken from the catalogue of melisse & israel ( 1994a ) except for ngc 4236 which was not included in their sample .",
    "for this galaxy we took the blue magnitude from de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 ) ( third reference catalogue , rc3 ) and the hi  flux from huchtmeier & richter ( 1989 ) .",
    "the bcd sample contains 16 galaxies .",
    "we have restricted the sample to small galaxies ( optical diameter less than 10 kpc ) in order to obtain a sample of galaxies comparable in size to the dirrs .",
    "the metallicities and distances were taken from kunth & svre ( 1986 ) , masegosa , moles & campos - aguilar ( 1994 ) and terlevich ( 1992 ) .",
    "the hi  fluxes are from the huchtmeier & richter ( 1989 ) , huchtmeier , hopp & kuhn ( 1997 ) , stavely - smith , davies & kinman ( 1992 ) and from rc3 .",
    "the fir fluxes were taken from the iras faint source catalogue ( 1990 ) .",
    "the hi  mass is derived from the hi  flux , @xmath10 as : @xmath11      the dust masses were calculated from the fir emission using a single temperature , black - body model : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the planck emission function , @xmath14 the distance to the galaxy , @xmath15 the iras flux at 100@xmath16 m and @xmath17 the dust temperature .",
    "the infrared dust absorption coefficient , @xmath18 , is assumed to be the same for all galaxies and was taken from hildebrand ( 1983 ) : @xmath19 @xmath17 is calculated from the ratio of the iras fluxes at 60 and 100 @xmath16 m .",
    "together this yields : @xmath20^{1.5 } -1 \\right\\ }     { m_{\\odot}}\\ ] ] we assumed @xmath21 .",
    "the choice of @xmath22 has only a minor influence on the dust mass .",
    "the dust mass inferred from the fir emission as described above is affected essentially by two main uncertainties .",
    "first , the value of the dust mass calculated as described above depends sensitively on the dust temperature derived from the 60-to-100@xmath16 m flux ratio .",
    "we assume hereby that both the 60 and the 100@xmath16 m flux is dominated by the emission of big grains , that contain most of the dust mass , and are in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field . if very small grains ( vsgs ) , whose temperature is fluctuating , contribute significantly to the 60@xmath16 m emission this method produces wrong results .",
    "an analysis of the galactic diffuse , cirrus  , emission and extinction curve in the solar neighborhood ( dsert , boulanger & puget 1990 ) has shown that the emission of vsgs could indeed be responsible for 60% of the 60@xmath16 m flux , but only for 15% of the flux at 100@xmath16 m . since the contribution of vsgs to the dust mass is negligible , this results in an error in the dust mass of a factor 3 . a similar result was obtained by sodrowski ( 1987 ) who analyzed the fir emission in our galaxy and found that the dust temperature derived from the 60/100@xmath16 m ratio stays almost constant with galactic radius in spite of the decreasing radiation field .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the 60@xmath16 m emission is to a large extent produced by vsgs .",
    "the apparent dust - to - gas mass ratio derived from the fir emission with this constant temperature profile decreased by a factor of 3 outwardly . assuming that the dust - gas ratio is the same everywhere in the galaxy , the implied error of the dust mass in this analysis is also a factor of 3 .",
    "however , the contribution of vsgs to the 60@xmath16 m flux is expected to be only significant in a low radiation field in which the big grains have a low temperature and contribute little to the 60@xmath16 m emission ( dsert 1990 ) .",
    "this is not the case for dwarf galaxies which show higher 60/100@xmath16 m and lower 12/25@xmath16 m ratios than spiral galaxies ( xu & de zotti 1991 , melisse & israel 1994b ) indicating a lack of cirrus emission .",
    "therefore we can expect that the error due to vsgs is smaller than estimated for the galactic cirrus emission .",
    "we have carried out the following qualitative test for this assumption : if the dust temperature derived from the 60 and 100@xmath16 m fluxes is a good measure for the real temperature of the big grains , it should correlate with the radiation field . in fig .",
    "[ bol - temp ] the dust temperature and the surface brightness of the bolometric luminosity for both samples are plotted .",
    "the bolometric luminosity was calculated as described below and the galaxy surface area is obtained from the optical diameter .",
    "a good correlation between the dust temperature and the bolometric surface brightness is visible .",
    "the correlation coefficient ( only detections ) is @xmath23 .",
    "this supports our assumption that the dust temperature represents the temperature of big grains in thermal equilibrium .",
    "next , the dust - to - gas ratio derived from the fir emission is generally significantly , up to a factor of 10 , lower than the value found from the analysis of the extinction in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this has been found both for simple blackbody models like the present one ( young 1989 ; devereux & young 1990 ) as well as for more detailed dust models ( rowan - robinson 1992 ) .",
    "the presence of cold dust , emitting mainly beyond 100 @xmath16 m , might be responsible for the discrepancy .",
    "on the basis of the available data it is not possible to decide about this point , observations at longer wavelengths would be necessary .",
    "because of this uncertainty we have carried out a further test to check whether our dust masses are reasonable : we have compared them with an alternative way to estimate the dust mass , through an energy balance between the fraction of the radiation absorbed by the dust and escaping from a galaxy ( xu & buat 1995 ; xu & helou 1996 ) . from the fraction of nonionizing radiation absorbed by the dust",
    "we can estimate the dust opacity and from that , assuming that the opacity produced by a certain dust mass is the same as in the galaxy , the dust mass per area can be calculated .",
    "we have calculated the fraction of radiation absorbed by dust following the model of xu & buat ( 1995 ) who estimate the bolometric luminosity from the ultraviolet ( @xmath24 ) , blue ( @xmath25 ) and fir fluxes .",
    "for our sample , the ultraviolet ( uv ) fluxes were available for only 9 galaxies ( taken from fanelli 1997 ; hill 1994 ; deharveng 1994 ; donas 1987 ; donas & deharveng 1984 ) .",
    "for these we derived @xmath26 which we use for the whole sample .    the ratio of the fir - to - bolometric luminosity gives the fraction of radiation absorbed by the dust .",
    "if our dust mass estimate is correct , this value should be related to the dust mass per surface area .",
    "indeed , we found a good correlation between these two quantities ( @xmath27 ) . in order to quantify",
    "this further we have to make a distinction between dust emission from hii  regions and diffuse dust emission .",
    "the dust in hii  regions is mainly heated by ionizing photons which are almost completely absorbed by the dust locally , practically independent of the dust amount . the diffuse dust , on the other hand",
    ", is mainly heated by nonionizing photons and the amount of radiation absorbed is directly related to the dust opacity .",
    "thus , in order to calculate the ( diffuse ) dust opacity we have to subtract the dust heating by ionizing photons .",
    "we estimate the ionizing uv radiation from the @xmath28 emission .",
    "the total @xmath28 fluxes were available for a large part of the dirr sample ( 18 galaxies , @xmath28 fluxes taken from hunter , hawley & gallagher 1993 , hunter 1989 , kennicutt & kent 1983 ) .",
    "since the dust opacity is generally low in dwarf galaxies , the extinction of the @xmath28 line is likely to be small and we neglected it .",
    "the total dust emission originating from ionizing radiation can be estimated as @xmath29 ( xu & buat 1995 ) .",
    "the average fraction of dust emission due to heating by ionizing photons is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the total dust emission , extrapolated from the fir emission according to xu & buat ( 1995 ) .",
    "we use this average value for the galaxies for which no @xmath28 data is available .",
    "the diffuse dust opacity is estimated using a simplified radiation transfer model with a slab geometry , assuming that dust and stars are homogeneously mixed . in view of the uncertainty of the real diffuse dust distribution in the individual galaxies",
    "this simplification seems to be justified .",
    "a different geometry , e.g. a sandwich distribution  or a clumpy dust distribution would lead to a different value for the dust opacity and the dust mass . a crucial assumption in the present test is therefore that there is no _",
    "systematic _ change in the diffuse dust morphology , i.e. that there is no correlation between the geometry ( e.g. clumpiness ) and the absorbed fraction of radiation , dust - to - gas ratio or metallicity .",
    "we use an approximate formula ( xu & de zotti 1989 ) for the dust absorption probability , further simplified by dividing the nonionizing radiation into two ( optical and uv ) bands for which we take the extinction properties at 4300   and 2000  , respectively ( see lisenfeld , vlk & xu 1996 ) . the opacities deduced ( at 4300  ) , @xmath32 , range between @xmath33 and @xmath34 . assuming that the dust has the same extinction properties as dust in our galaxy ( dsert 1990 ) , we can estimate the dust mass as @xmath35=8.8\\,10 ^ 4 \\times\\tau_b \\times \\left({a_{gal } \\over \\rm kpc^2}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the optical surface area of the galaxy . in fig .",
    "[ tau - mass ] the dust mass estimated in this way and the dust mass calculated from the fir emission are compared .",
    "the most striking result is the very good ( @xmath37 ) and linear ( slope = @xmath38 ) correlation between the two quantities .",
    "the dispersion around the regression line is 0.34 dex , corresponding to a factor of 2.2 .",
    "the dust mass derived from the fir emission is on average a factor of 29 lower than the mass derived from the opacity . however , since the main aim of the present work is the comparison of the dust - to - gas ratio with the metallicity of galaxies , the absolute value of the dust mass is only of secondary importance ; the crucial point is that the _ ratio _ of the dust masses is correct .",
    "the linear correlation between the dust masses derived in two different ways ( from the fir emission and from the extinction ) corroborates that this latter assumption is correct .",
    "in fig . [ dust - gas - dirr ] - [ dust - gas - tot ] the dust - to - gas ratios and the metallicities are plotted for the two samples . for the galaxies with upper limits in both iras fluxes ,",
    "the dust temperature is undefined and therefore , strictly speaking , the dust mass as well .",
    "since the dust temperature in the samples shows a small dispersion ( all values lie between 22 and 42 k ) we adopted @xmath39 k for these 4 dirr galaxies and calculate the dust mass with this value in order to give at least an indicative value ( filled squares in in fig .",
    "[ dust - gas - dirr ] - [ dust - gas - tot ] ) . in the same way",
    ", we adopt for the bcds that were not detected by iras an upper limit of 1 jy at 100 @xmath16 m and a dust temperature of 32 k , corresponding to the average value found for this sample .",
    "we only considered the hi  gas mass in our analysis .",
    "the extent of the hi  emission is generally much larger than the optical diameter . fouqu ( 1983 ) has found that on average for irregular galaxies the hi  effective radius ( i.e. the radius within which half of the hi  gas is contained ) , @xmath40 , and the optical isophotal radius , @xmath41 , are nearly the same , @xmath42 . even if there is dust associated with this extended hi  it is , due to the absence of heating sources , very cold and therefore unlikely to contribute to the fir emission .",
    "therefore , in order to get an accurate value for the dust - to - gas ratio within the optical disk , we only consider the hi  mass within the optical disk , @xmath43 , by dividing the total hi  mass by 2 .",
    "we could not derive @xmath44 masses for the whole sample because of the lack of data .",
    "we expect the error to be small , at least for dwarf irregulars , since the molecular gas content is generally much less than the atomic gas content : whereas the molecular mass content of spiral galaxies is in general roughly comparable to the atomic gas content with a median value of @xmath45 ( andreani , casoli & gerin 1993 ; devereux & young 1990 ) , in dwarf irregular this ratio is lower . cohen ( 1988 ) derived in the lmc a molecular - to - atomic gas fraction of 30% .",
    "molecular hydrogen absorption measurements gave an even lower value of 6 % ( clayton 1996 ) .",
    "for the smc the molecular - to - atomic gas ratio is estimated to be 7% ( rubio 1991 ) . for 7 galaxies of our sample",
    "we could find co data in the literature ( young 1995 , elfhag 1996 ) .",
    "the conversion factor from @xmath44 to co is extremely uncertain for dwarf galaxies and very likely to be considerably higher than the standard value used for galactic molecular gas clouds .",
    "the conversion factors found for the magellanic clouds are 6 times higher than for the galaxy ( lmc , cohen 1988 ) and 20 times higher ( smc , rubio 1991 ) . adopting an intermediate value of 10 times the galactic conversion factor we obtained only for one galaxy ( ngc 6764 ) a molecular gas mass larger than the atomic gas mass .",
    "it is difficult to assess the possible error caused by neglecting molecular gas , however the above considerations have shown that the likely error caused is less than a factor of 2 .",
    "we estimate the total error in the dust - to - gas ratio derived in this way to be about a factor of 4 .",
    "this number takes into account the possible error in the dust mass due to vsgs ( factor 2 ) , cold dust ( factor 2 , estimated from the dispersion of the correlation in fig .",
    "[ tau - mass ] ) , molecular gas ( factor 2 ) , and a varying hi  /optical diameter ( factor 1.6 ) .    for the dirr sample there exists a good correlation between the dust - to - gas ratio and the metallicity ( fig .",
    "[ dust - gas - dirr ] ) . only one galaxy ( gr8 ) is clearly off the correlation .",
    "not taking into account this galaxy and the 4 galaxies with only upper limits in the fir , the correlation coefficient is @xmath46 .",
    "the correlation is not linear ; a least square fit yields : 12+log(o / h ) @xmath47 .",
    "the error in the slope takes into account the dispersion of the data points around the least - square fit line , the error in the dust mass of a factor 4 and an error in the metal abundance of 0.2 dex .",
    "this result is in agreement with earlier studies : schmidt & boller ( 1993 ) obtained a very similar slope in the correlation as we ( 0.63 @xmath48 ) which is to be expected because our sample is an extension ( 7 more galaxies ) of theirs .",
    "the results of issa ( 1990 ) who compared the dust - to - gas ratio in nearby galaxies are similar . from their data a slope of 0.85 @xmath49 0.1 can be obtained ( schmidt & boller 1993 ) .",
    "the sample of the bcds shows no obvious correlation between the dust - to - gas ratio and the metallicity ( fig .",
    "[ dust - gas - bcd ] ) . both the average dust - to gas ratio as well as",
    "the average metallicity tend to be higher for this sample than for the dirrs ( fig .",
    "[ dust - gas - tot ] ) . for a given metallicity",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio is on average higher than for the dirr galaxies .",
    "we are now interested in developing a simple model that explains the observed behavior of the dust - to - gas / metallicity relation in dwarf galaxies . in particular",

    "the returned fraction and the net yield can be obtained using the standard formulae ( maeder 1992 ) : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the initial mass function ( imf ) defined between the lower and upper masses @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and @xmath108 ( @xmath109 for @xmath110 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 ) is the remnant mass ( white dwarf or neutron star ) .",
    "we have used a power law form of the imf , @xmath113 with @xmath114 ( standard salpeter ) and @xmath115 ( scalo 1986 ) .",
    "we have taken the oxygen stellar yield , @xmath116 ( the mass fraction of a star of mass @xmath117 converted into oxygen and ejected ) from arnett ( 1990 ) . with these assumptions",
    "we obtain @xmath118 and @xmath119 for the ( salpeter , scalo ) imf , respectively .    as a consistency check of our simple chemical and dust evolution model",
    "one could try to reproduce , at least qualitatively , the observed ( @xmath120 ) relation , where @xmath121 is the ratio between the gas and stellar mass of the system . from eqs.[mg1]-[mi1 ] , it is easy to obtain that @xmath122.\\ ] ] the experimental determination of @xmath16 is very uncertain because it is difficult to derive reliable values for @xmath123 .",
    "however , we have been able to reasonably constrain the value of @xmath16 for seven dirrs in our sample from their h - band ( 1.6 @xmath16 m ) luminosity and we find @xmath124 .",
    "using @xmath125 , the above formula reproduces quite satisfactorily the observed trend and numerical value of the metallicity - astration relation .",
    "this outflow rate , as we show in the next section , is very close to the one we require to explain the dust - to - gas ratio of dwarf galaxies .",
    "once @xmath75 and @xmath76 have been fixed , the solution given by eq .",
    "[ sol ] contains four free parameters : @xmath126 .",
    "however , the solution is quite insensitive to @xmath61 : we take it equal to unity .",
    "thus , we are left with three free parameters .",
    "the precise value of @xmath62 , the dust - to - o mass ratio in stellar dust sources , is rather uncertain ; a simple estimate can be obtained as follows .",
    "a typical sn ejects @xmath127 of heavy elements into the ism .",
    "however , only the fraction of oxygen ( which dominates the ejected material ) that can bind to refractory elements can go into grains , at most 25% as derived from ism depletion studies .",
    "in addition a rather optimistic upper limit for the efficiency of grain formation ( largely unknown ) is @xmath128 .",
    "thus , @xmath129 , but likely to be typically smaller than this value . given our present ignorance of the processes governing dust formation",
    ", we will explore below ( see fig .",
    "[ model2 ] ) the effects of varying @xmath62 within a range of reasonable values .",
    "for the last two free parameters , which describe the outflow process , @xmath130 and @xmath63 , the outflow rate ( in units of the sfr ) and the dust fractional content of the outflow , we take @xmath131 and @xmath132 in order to cover a reasonably large parameter space .",
    "[ model1 ] shows the main results of this section .",
    "there we plot the solutions for different values of @xmath130 and @xmath63 and compare them with the data points corresponding to the dust - to - gas vs. metallicity relation shown in fig .",
    "[ dust - gas - tot ] .",
    "the model results are shown for both a salpeter ( solid lines ) and a scalo ( dashed ) imf .",
    "several interesting points can be made from an inspection of this fig .",
    "[ model1 ] .",
    "first , we conclude that a simple power - law does not represent a good fit to the data , but a more much physically meaningful functional is the one given by eq .",
    "[ sol ] . for low values of @xmath1 the relation",
    "is shown to be quasi - linear , whereas for higher values the shape of the curve depends sensitively on @xmath63 and @xmath130 , through the coefficient @xmath133 in eq .",
    "[ sol ] . in general , for a fixed value of @xmath63 , a higher value of the outflow rate produces a flatter curve ; the same effect can be obtained by decreasing @xmath63 : both situations allow the system to retain a larger fraction of dust . however , the solutions only depend on the product @xmath134 , as can be seen from the coefficient @xmath133 in eq .",
    "[ coeffs ] ; @xmath4 can be interpreted as a `` differential '' outflow rate .",
    "next , we note that the @xmath3 relation _ does not _ depend on the particular sfr @xmath5 of the galaxy : this could be expected since both metal and dust production are strictly connected implying that the relation found is rather general ; however , if all the parameters are constant in time , a given galaxy is forced to move along the appropriate curve as it gets metal and dust enriched .",
    "the curves are moderately sensitive to the imf , with the scalo imf covering a larger region of the @xmath3 plane for the given set of parameters",
    ".    the results also point out the importance of outflows for dwarf galaxies .",
    "the effect of mass loss is particularly evident in the high-@xmath1 part of the curves where it results in a flattening ; the data require that most of the dwarfs in the sample must have undergone a substantial outflow episode . the segregation of bcds in the high metallicity , high dust - to - gas ratio region of the plane can be then explained by a higher sfr with respect to dirrs , which implies a more substantial enrichment in metals and dust .",
    "support to this hypothesis is lent by the fact that bcds are all consistent with large values ( @xmath135 ) of the differential outflow rate @xmath4 , since ultimately the sfr determines the rate of sne powering the wind .",
    "some uncertainty affects the low-@xmath1 , low-@xmath0 part of the curves which is sensitive to the precise value of @xmath62 , as shown by fig .",
    "[ model2 ] for the scalo imf . in the limit @xmath136 , eq . [ sol ]",
    "reduces to @xmath137 , the solution scales linearly with @xmath62 , which we have allowed to vary in @xmath138 .",
    "thus the precise value of @xmath62 could be possibly constrained by observations of extremely metal poor objects .",
    "we have compared the metallicity and the dust - to - gas ratio in a sample of 44 ( 28 dirr + 16 bcd ) dwarf galaxies .",
    "the dust mass has been derived from the fir emission assuming that the dust composition is the same for all galaxies .",
    "we have carried out various tests in order to check the reliability of this dust mass determination . for the sample of dirr galaxies we found a good correlation between the two quantities , obeying the empirical relation 12+log(o / h ) @xmath139 .",
    "for bcd galaxies we did not find such a good correlation ; both the dust - to - gas ratio and the metallicity tend to be higher than in the dirr sample , and for a given metallicity the dust - to - gas ratio is on average higher than for the dirr galaxies .",
    "we have derived a simple analytical form for the expected dust - to - gas ratio vs. metallicity , @xmath3 , relation ( we have assumed that oxygen is a good metallicity indicator ) and compared it with the observational data .",
    "the main results are the following :      @xmath140 the deviation from the linear behavior depends critically on the parameter @xmath134 , the `` differential '' mass outflow rate from the galaxy in units of the sfr @xmath5 , and is negative if @xmath141 .",
    "most of the galaxies in the sample can then be inferred to have undergone a substantial outflow episode .",
    "@xmath140 the _ shape _ of the @xmath3 curve does not depend on the sfr , @xmath5 , of the galaxy but only on the outflow rate ; however , the specific location of a given galaxy on the curve does depend on @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath140 the bcd metallicity segregation is due to a higher sfr , also suggested by their consistency with the generally larger values of the outflow rates required .",
    "the lack of correlation could then be produced by largely different star formation rates and values of @xmath4 in these objects .",
