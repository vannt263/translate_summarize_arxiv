    "formation theories suggest that planets form in protoplanetary disks around their hosts , either through core accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ) or disk instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the masses and frequencies of planets are thus tightly related to the disk masses , and indirectly to the mass of their hosts .",
    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) are substellar objects not massive enough to ignite hydrogen fusion . according to current theory ,",
    "bds represent the lower - mass end of star formation via direct collapse of molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , studying planet formation around bds , with their low - mass disks , probes the limiting conditions for planet formation .",
    "@xcite extended the study of core accretion models of @xcite to ultracool dwarfs ( very low - mass stars and bds ) .",
    "they predict that if bds have few - jupiter - mass disks , then earth - mass planets should be frequent around them , with typical semi - major axes @xmath5 and maximum planetary masses @xmath6 .",
    "however , if bd disks contain only a fraction of a jupiter mass then they probably can not form even an earth - mass planet .",
    "early statistical studies of disks around ultracool dwarfs showed that they are as frequent as around sun - like stars @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite used alma to study 17 young brown dwarfs and found continuum emission , indicating the existence of dusty disks , in 11 of them .",
    "the estimated dust masses in these disks are @xmath70.5 - 6@xmath8 , suggesting total disk masses @xmath70.1 - 2@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite used @xmath10 to study 29 ultracool dwarfs and found that about half have disks with at least one jupiter mass .",
    "the detection of planets around ultracool dwarfs is challenging for most planetary detection methods because they rely on light from the faint host and/or the even fainter planet .",
    "four such systems were found via direct imaging , all with a massive planet ( @xmath11 ) : 2mass 1207 - 3932 @xcite , 2mass 0441 - 2301 @xcite , vhs 1256 - 1257 @xcite , and cfbdsir 1458 + 1013 @xcite . however , the companion - star mass ratios ( @xmath12 ) and large separations ( @xmath13 , except cfbdsir 1458 + 1013 with @xmath72.3 @xmath14 but @xmath15 ) suggest they were formed similarly to binary systems through gravitational fragmentation @xcite rather than like planetary systems .",
    "recently , @xcite detected seven terrestrial planets transiting the nearby ultracool dwarf star trappist-1 , whose host mass @xmath16 places it slightly above the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "the planets have few - day near - resonant periods , suggesting they formed farther out and then migrated inward .",
    "in contrast to these discovery techniques , gravitational microlensing does not rely on light from the system but is directly sensitive to the masses of the planet and its host .",
    "its basic observable is the einstein timescale @xmath17 , which encompasses the total lens mass @xmath18 , the lens - source relative parallax @xmath19 , and relative proper motion @xmath20 . breaking the @xmath21 degeneracy requires two additional parameter measurements , the angular einstein radius @xmath22 and the amplitude of the microlens parallax vector @xmath23 , which yield @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "four previous microlensing events revealed planets orbiting ultracool dwarfs .",
    "@xcite found a low - mass planet in event moa-2007-blg-192 whose characterization was then substantially tightened by @xcite and @xcite . the latter used adaptive optics to measure the lens flux , from which they derived a planet of mass @xmath73@xmath26 projected at @xmath70.7@xmath14 around a @xmath70.08@xmath27 late m dwarf .",
    "however , because the planetary deviation was sparsely covered , the uncertainties on the planet s mass and separation are large . @xcite discovered a @xmath72@xmath26 planet at @xmath70.8@xmath14 from a 0.1 - 0.15@xmath27 m dwarf , which is one member of a binary system with a slightly heavier companion ( 0.12 - 0.18@xmath27 ) .",
    "this planet had the lowest securely - measured mass found by microlensing previous to the one presented here .",
    "these two detections of planets with @xmath28 at @xmath5 around ultracool dwarfs agree well with the predictions of @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite discovered a @xmath72@xmath9 planet at projected separation @xmath70.9@xmath14 orbiting a @xmath70.02@xmath29 bd . while the mass ratio suggests a binary - like formation mechanism , the relatively close projected separation hints at possible in - disk formation .",
    "finally , @xcite discovered a planetary system in microlensing event moa-2013-blg-605 .",
    "they found three degenerate microlensing models , two of which suggest a super earth orbiting at 12@xmath14 around a bd , while the third suggests a neptune orbiting a @xmath30 m dwarf .",
    "the mass ratio in all solutions clearly favor a planetary formation scenario , but the possibility of a mid - m - dwarf host prevents the setting of strong constraints on planet formation models around bds .    here",
    "we analyze the planetary microlensing event ogle-2016-blg-1195 .",
    "the event was observed by @xmath0 and several ground surveys .",
    "the ground light curve shows a very short anomaly after the peak , indicating a low mass planetary companion , while the parallax measurement from @xmath0 allows us to determine that it is a @xmath71@xmath8 planet around an ultracool dwarf at the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "the microlens modeling yields eight degenerate solutions , which are well understood theoretically @xcite .",
    "however , again for well - understood reasons , all solutions imply similar physical properties for the system .    the @xmath0 microlensing campaign has enabled the systematic measurement of the microlens parallax for well over 200 events over its first three seasons .",
    "these will enable the first measurement of the galactic distribution of planets @xcite , a demographic regime that is currently uniquely explored by microlensing ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the 2014 and 2015 @xmath0 campaigns have already led to the publication of two other planetary systems @xcite , both of which are located in the galactic disk , similar to ogle-2016-blg-1195 lb .",
    "ogle-2016-blg-1195 was alerted on ut 13:37 27 june 2016 by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) , using the ogle early warning system @xcite .",
    "the event was also observed by the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) collaboration @xcite , which recognized and alerted the planetary anomaly at ut 15:45 29 june , less than two hours after it began .",
    "the analysis and data in this paper are completely independent from that derived from the ogle and moa datasets @xcite .",
    "the event was observed by korea microlensing telescope network ( kmtnet ; @xcite ) that employs @xmath31 cameras at three sites : ctio / chile , saao / south africa , and sso / australia . at ( ra , dec )",
    "= ( 17:55:23.5 , @xmath3230:12:26.1 ) ( j2000.0 ) , the event was in an overlapping region between three high - cadence ( 25 min ) fields , for a combined cadence @xmath33 , which allowed for dense coverage of the short anomaly .",
    "these observations were carried out as part of the routine survey and were not influenced by the moa alert .",
    "most observations were in @xmath34 band , with additional sparse @xmath35 band observations for source characterization .",
    "kmtnet photometry was extracted using an adapted version of the pysis dia software @xcite for the event modeling , and dophot @xcite for the source color information .",
    "the event was announced by ogle on a monday morning ( pdt ) , less than two hours before the @xmath0 team had to submit the targets to observe in the coming week .",
    "based on a preliminary model suggesting a high - magnification event , it was selected as a `` secret '' target ( see details below ) . on the following morning ( pdt ) , the team confirmed the model using new ogle data , and immediately announced the event as a `` subjective '' @xmath0 target on june 28 ut 15:33 ( hjd=7568.15 ) , about a day before the anomaly and 3.7 days before the @xmath0 observations actually started .",
    "@xmath0 observations are of targeted , on - going events and thus require well defined selection criteria to avoid biases toward planetary events .",
    "these selection criteria are fully described in @xcite .",
    "here we briefly summarize the three selection modes .",
    "when an event passes certain brightness and planet sensitivity criteria ( as inferred from its point - lens model ) at the target submission deadline , it is automatically selected as a @xmath0 target and considered as `` objective '' .",
    "however , if an event model suggests it _ will _ have high planet sensitivity , the team can select it `` subjectively '' , even before it meets the criteria ( if it ever does ) .",
    "this allows for early @xmath0 observations and increases the overall campaign sensitivity for planets while still permitting an unbiased sample .",
    "lastly , the team can select a promising event with a weakly constrained point - lens model as `` secret '' . if the event turns out to be promising ( but without any indications of a planetary perturbation ) , the team can select ( and announce ) it as `` subjective '' , and it is then included in the final sample .",
    "ogle-2016-blg-1195 was such event .",
    "( if a `` secret '' event turns out to be unpromising , it is discarded and is not included in the final statistical sample . )",
    "ogle-2016-blg-1195 was observed by @xmath0 during the final three weeks of the 2016 campaign ( july 224 ) , with a cadence of 1 observation per day .",
    "each epoch is composed of six 30-second dithered exposures using the 3.6 @xmath36 m channel on irac , and the data were reduced using the new algorithm for @xmath0 crowded - field photometry ( @xcite ) .",
    "the event was faint in @xmath0 images , with a peak of @xmath37 and baseline of @xmath38 .",
    "the reductions therefore required special handling .",
    "the precise astrometric position of the source was determined from kmtnet difference images at high magnification . using this position in the analysis ,",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "photometry was significantly improved relative to photometry based on the catalog position of the apparent `` star '' at the base of the microlensing event .",
    "standard binary - lens microlensing models require seven geometric parameters to calculate the magnification , @xmath39 .",
    "these include the three point - lens parameters @xmath40 @xcite , the angular source radius @xmath41 scaled to @xmath22 ( @xmath42 ) , and three parameters for the companion : the mass ratio @xmath43 , the instantaneous projected separation ( scaled to @xmath22 ) @xmath44 , and an angle @xmath45 , between the source trajectory and the binary axis in the lens plane .",
    "in addition , each dataset @xmath46 , has two parameters ( @xmath47 ) representing the source flux and any additional blend flux : @xmath48    the light curve ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) has one short ( @xmath49 hr ) anomaly @xmath50hr after the peak of an otherwise standard point - lens moderate - magnification ( @xmath51 ) microlensing event . combined with the effective timescale @xmath52hr , this indicates a planetary mass - ratio companion close to the einstein ring , aligned @xmath53 relative to the source trajectory .",
    "the single bump in the light curve implies that the source passes the single prong of the central caustic , which faces ( `` points toward '' ) the planet in both close and wide topologies .",
    "we first solve for @xmath54 because this topology is unencumbered by additional caustics on this side of the central caustic .",
    "the @xmath55 solution will immediately follow from the close - wide degeneracy @xcite .",
    "we seed a markov - chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) with close companions ( @xmath54 ) at an angle of @xmath56 and with mass ratios ranging @xmath57 . to calculate the model magnifications near and during the anomaly",
    ", we employ contour integration @xcite with 10 annuli to allow for limb darkening .",
    "we adopt a linear coefficient @xmath58 @xcite , based on the source type derived in section  [ sec : cmd ] .",
    "far from the anomaly we employ limb - darkened multipole approximations @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath59 , which is in the resonant - caustic regime . while the source does not cross the caustic , it passes close enough and over a narrow `` shoulder '' on the magnification surface to permit a clear measurement of the scaled source size , @xmath60 ( figure  [ fig : caustics ] ) .    finally , we seed the @xmath61 mcmc search at @xmath62 and at the boundary between the wide and resonant topologies .",
    "the result is @xmath63 for which the source passes over a narrow `` saddle '' between two marginally separated caustics ( figure [ fig : caustics ] ) .",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath61 solutions prove fully degenerate .",
    "observations of a microlensing event by two widely separated observers ( e.g. , from earth and space ) results in different observed light curves @xcite .",
    "since the physical separation between the two observers ( @xmath65 ) is known , modeling the two light curves directly yields the microlens parallax , @xmath66 where the subscripts indicate parameters as measured from the satellite and earth .",
    "however , due to the symmetry of the problem it usually suffers from a four - fold `` satellite '' degeneracy in @xmath67 ( equation  ( [ eqn : pieframe ] ) ) .",
    "when including @xmath0 , we re - run the mcmc process with all four possibilities for both the wide and close configurations .",
    "in addition , we include a constraint on the @xmath0 source flux , @xmath68 , derived from color - color regression ( see section  [ sec : cmd ] ) .",
    "we find that indeed the @xmath69 possible solutions are fully degenerate .",
    "the magnitude @xmath70 is roughly the same for all solutions since @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : model ] summarizes the derived model parameters and their uncertainties for all eight solutions .",
    "the most striking feature of these solutions is the relatively large microlens parallax @xmath72 , which ( combined with the small value of @xmath22 ) will yield small masses for both the host and the planet ( see section [ sec : earth ] ) .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : lc ] demonstrates , independent of any model , that there is a significant parallax effect .",
    "first , inset ( c ) shows that the _ spitzer _ magnification is larger than the ground - based magnification at the same time .",
    "because the peak ground - based magnification is quite high @xmath73 , _ spitzer _ s substantially higher post - peak magnification directly implies that it peaks substantially later .",
    "the fact that the first _ spitzer",
    "_ points nearly overlap the ground - based magnification then implies substantially larger @xmath74 as well .",
    "one may therefore qualitatively infer that both components of the parallax should be large .",
    "to make this argument more concrete , we consider a range of models with different @xmath75 , and with the _ spitzer _ flux constraint set at @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 from value that we derive from the @xmath79 color - color relation .",
    "the lowest of these value @xmath80 would yield the lowest @xmath81 and therefore the lowest value of @xmath82 ( and so potentially the lowest value of @xmath83 , depending on the value of @xmath84 for that solution ) .",
    "this ( and other low @xmath85 ) solutions also seem naively in accord with the fact that the data appear to fall almost monotonically over the first nine points , whereas the best model peaks between the second and third data points .",
    "the last value in this series is a few days later than in the best fit model .",
    "the results of this test are shown in figure  [ fig : forcedt0 ] .",
    "the lower panel demonstrates that indeed if @xmath85 is artificially pushed lower , the value of @xmath83 is reduced .",
    "however , for @xmath86 , this is almost entirely due to shrinking @xmath82 , while @xmath87 remains essentially constant .",
    "hence , at this point @xmath83 is still 60% of the best - fit value ( meaning that the main physical conclusions would be qualitatively similar ) , while @xmath88 is already quite high .",
    "note also that the @xmath89 trajectories for different @xmath68 ( shown by different colors ) are essentially identical , with the major difference being the higher @xmath90 penalty for the @xmath91 tracks .",
    "the basic reason that @xmath83 changes very little over this range is that , a week after the ground - based peak @xmath92 , while the `` observed '' _ spitzer _ magnification is @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "this implies @xmath95 ( hence @xmath96 ) unless the model is forced to systematically fall below the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "the mass and distance of the lensing system can be derived from @xmath83 and @xmath22 ( equation  [ eqn : meqn ] ) . these allow us to use the mass ratio @xmath43 and the scaled projected separation @xmath44 to derive the masses and physical projected separation of the two bodies .",
    "while @xmath83 is directly measured in the microlensing model , @xmath22 is derived from @xmath97 ( found from the light curve model ) and @xmath41 ( found using the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) ) : @xmath98 .",
    "the source properties are derived from its position on a cmd , constructed using stars from a @xmath99 field centered on the event s position ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) , using kmtnet instrumental @xmath35-band and @xmath34-band magnitudes .",
    "we measure the centroid of the `` red giant clump '' ( rgc ) @xmath100 and compare it to the intrinsic centroid of @xmath101 @xcite for the event s galactic coordinates @xmath102 .",
    "the kmtnet @xmath34-band source magnitude as inferred from the microlensing model is @xmath103 , and assuming it is behind the same dust column as the red clump , its intrinsic magnitude is @xmath104 .    a standard way to determine",
    "the instrumental @xmath105 color is from regression of @xmath35 versus @xmath34 flux as the source magnification changes @xcite . applying this to kmtnet data yields @xmath106 , from which we derive @xmath107 by correcting to the clump offset found above . using standard color - color relations @xcite and the relation between angular source size and surface brightness @xcite , we find @xmath108 .",
    "we use red giant branch stars ( @xmath109 ) , which are a good representation of the bulge star population , to derive an instrumental @xmath79 color - color relation .",
    "since the source is significantly bluer than this range we apply a new color - color method . for each giant",
    "we use the dereddened @xmath110 color to find the corresponding @xmath111 based on @xcite giants , and derive the offset between the instrumental ( @xmath112 ) and the @xmath111 for the sample .",
    "we then use the source @xmath113 color and find its corresponding @xmath114 based on @xcite dwarfs relations are derived for ground - based @xmath115 band , which differs somewhat from the _ spitzer",
    "_ @xmath116 m band , it can still be used essentially unmodified for our purposes .",
    "this is because these authors report @xmath117 , which is already quite small , and the further correction from @xmath115 to @xmath116 m is an order of magnitude smaller . ] .",
    "finally , we use the color offset to find the source instrumental color , @xmath118 , which is used to constrain the _",
    "spitzer _ source - star flux in the modeling .",
    "for comparison , we also derive the source instrumental color using linear @xmath79 color - color relation using the giants and extrapolate it to the source ( see @xcite for didactic explanation ) .",
    "the color we find using this method is @xmath119 , which is in agreement with the new method . while the previous method works extremely well for colors in the range of the giants , it is important to use the new method when extrapolating from the calibration range .      as mentioned above , the four - fold degenerate parallax solutions ( @xmath89 ) have approximately the same magnitude , and so give similar masses , distance from earth and relative proper motion of the planetary system .",
    "in addition , the wide and close solutions are very close to @xmath120 , and so the projected separation is also similar . in summary ,",
    "the derived physical properties of the eight degenerate model solutions are all in agreement within 1@xmath121 . therefore , we combine the results from the different models and give the median and 68% uncertainty range of the physical properties of the system in table  [ tab : physical ] .",
    "the host star mass is @xmath3 ( or @xmath122 ) , i.e. , with mean just at the hydrogen - burning mass limit at solar metallicity .",
    "the companion mass is @xmath1 , which is the lowest mass planet discovered by microlensing , and it orbits the ultracool dwarf at a projected separation of @xmath2 .",
    "the system lies in the galactic disk , at @xmath4 kpc toward the bulge .",
    "the relative proper motion between the source and the lens is @xmath123 mas / yr , which is consistent with expectations for disk lenses .",
    "however , the direction of the proper motion is clustered at @xmath124 , whereas typical disk lenses at @xmath125kpc would have @xmath126 .",
    "this discrepancy could be resolved by the lens moving @xmath127 relative to its local standard of rest ( i.e. , halo lens ) or the source moving @xmath128 relative to the bulge ( or some combination ) .",
    "both possibilities would seem to have low prior probability . however , recall that in section  [ sec : spitzer ] we showed that the negative value of @xmath129 ( hence @xmath130 ) is a direct consequence of the relatively high magnification as seen by _ spitzer _ one week after @xmath131 , which is attested to by a whole series of _ spitzer _ measurements .",
    "hence , it is not easily avoided .",
    "the issue can be resolved by two epochs of high resolution imaging , which would measure the source proper motion relative to the bulge , @xmath132 , and so yield directly the lens proper motion @xmath133 .",
    "we have detected and characterized an earth - mass planet orbiting an ultracool dwarf ( at the hydrogen - burning limit , assuming solar metallicity ) at @xmath71@xmath134 .",
    "this system adds to two previous microlensing discoveries of planets of a few earth masses orbiting ultracool dwarfs .",
    "these suggest that the protoplanetary disks of ultracool dwarfs have sufficient mass to form terrestrial planets , as also hinted at by direct imaging of such disks . the location of these planets , at about @xmath135 , support planet formation predictions .",
    "however , since the sensitivity of current microlensing surveys for systems with such small mass ratios is very narrow , around projected separations of @xmath71@xmath14 , they can not set strong constraints on the presence of planets elsewhere around ultracool dwarfs , such as the much closer separations seen in the trappist-1 system .",
    "the dense coverage of the short duration anomaly induced by the low mass - ratio planet ogle-2016-blg-1195 lb was enabled due to the high - cadence coverage of kmtnet .",
    "this shows the importance of the new high - cadence global network surveys , which do not require the traditional alert and follow up mode , previously used in microlensing .",
    "future space - based microlensing surveys , such as @xmath136 @xcite , will have this required high - cadence and with their superior photometry will extend the detection sensitivity to wider separations and lower planetary masses .",
    "this is the third planet discovered as part of the @xmath0 microlensing campaign for measuring the galactic distribution of planets , and another few planetary candidates from the 2015 and 2016 seasons are currently being investigated .",
    "so far , all of the published planets are located in the galactic disk .",
    "@xcite studied the planet sensitivities of 2015 @xmath0 events with high - cadence kmtnet coverage and found that if the frequency of planets is equal in the bulge and in the disk , about 1/3 of the planet detections should be from systems in the bulge .",
    "with two final @xmath0 microlensing campaigns in 2017 and 2018 , and the expected additional planetary detections , we will be able to check for deviations from this expectation , and see if the bulge is deficient of planets , as the current detections hints and as suggested by @xcite .",
