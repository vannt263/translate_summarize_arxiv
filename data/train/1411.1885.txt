    "the modeling of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsn ) encompasses a large variety of physics , from the macroscopic description of the gravitational collapse to the microscopic properties of atomic and subatomic particles .",
    "one of the key physical inputs bridging the macro- and micro - physics in ccsn simulations is the equation - of - state ( eos ) , connecting the pressure of stellar matter to its energy density and temperature and composition , determined by the underlying interactions between the constituent particles .",
    "the essential physical ideas of the ccsn scenario are the rebound of the central region of the core upon reaching nuclear matter densities , the development and stalling of a shock wave as the rebounding material encounters material further out , and the revival of the shock wave by neutrino pressure .",
    "these processes occur in hot matter ( temperatures up to @xmath2 mev ) that bridges a density region in which inhomogeneous matter consisting of heavy nuclei , nucleons and light clusters ( deuterium , tritium , helions , @xmath3-particles ) transitions to uniform nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this transition region is expected to be mediated by heavy quasi - nuclei structures termed nuclear `` pasta '' after their exotic geometries : rods , slabs , cylindrical holes , bubbles and more complex networks of shapes @xcite .",
    "the formation of these phases is driven by the competition between the surface tension and the coulomb repulsion of closely spaced heavy nuclei , and their phase diagram in density and temperature space has been thoroughly explored phases in the context of both ccsn and neutron star crust matter @xcite using a variety of theoretical apparatus .",
    "the pasta phases appear in a well established density range @xmath4 @xmath1 and temperature range @xmath5mev .",
    "the equation of state throughout the transition region , and the exact nature of the phase transitions between the different shape phases of nuclear pasta , and from the pasta phases to uniform nuclear matter , all have an important bearing on the evolution of the shock .",
    "a stiffer eos acts against gravity to slow the collapse , causing a greater infall of material from the mantle , increasing the radius at which the shock forms , and weakening the shock .",
    "any phase transition in the collapsing matter will absorb heat , disrupt the homology , and again weaken the shock . establishing the nature and strength of these phase transitions",
    "is essential to a physically realistic description of ccsn energetics .",
    "the timescale for ccsn is believed to be of order of seconds and matter does not have enough time to reach @xmath6-equilibrium throughout the rapid changes @xcite .",
    "trapped neutrinos have the effect of freezing the lepton fraction , and simulations show that this leads to proton fractions that are approximately constant throughout the imploding core at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the nuclear pasta phases can be thought of as arising due to unstable collective modes in uniform matter @xcite , with the transition to uniform matter studies by analyzing the dynamical and thermodynamical spinodals in density and temperature space @xcite . to study the details of the pasta phases themselves , modeling of the inhomogeneous phases",
    "is required .",
    "a number of early works studying the pasta phases within semiclassical liquid drop ( ld ) and thomas - fermi ( tf ) formalisms predicted that the transitions between pasta phases and the transition to uniform nuclear matter were first order , accompanied by discontinuities in the pressure with increasing density @xcite .",
    "in such studies and similar , however , the nuclear pasta shapes expected to appear have to be specified _ a priori _ , with the ground state phase chosen to be the one that gives the minimum free energy at a particular density . many recent studies using these method and modern relativistic and non - relativistic nuclear energy density functionals",
    "have been conducted @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above studies , statistical models in which free nucleons are treated within a mean - field approximation and nuclei are considered to form a loosely interacting cluster gas tend to give a continuous phase transition @xcite , although such models do not take into account the pasta phases .",
    "more recently , the application of quantum and classical molecular dynamics ( qmd , cmd respectively ) and three - dimensional skyrme - hartree - fock ( 3dshf ) approaches have allowed energetically - preferred pasta phases to emerge bias - free during calculations @xcite , resulting in a number of previously unconsidered phases to be studied @xcite . the molecular dynamics methods trade a complete model of the nuclear interactions and quantum shell effects for the modeling of a very large number of nucleons in a large computational domain .",
    "the 3dshf method self - consistently includes quantum shell effects and a relatively sophisticated nuclear model but is limited to computational cell sizes containing no more than a few thousand nucleons @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the nuclear matter eos around saturation density are dominated by uncertainties in the nuclear symmetry energy , that component of the nuclear matter binding energy that describes the energy cost decreasing the proton fraction of matter .",
    "much progress has been made in constraining the symmetry energy @xmath8 and its density dependence @xmath9 around saturation density @xcite , with a current concordance of experimental probes of @xmath10 mev , @xmath11 mev . in the light of the most up - to - date set of nuclear constraints on nuclear matter properties in the vicinity of saturation density , coupled with constraints from the maximum mass of neutron stars @xcite , dutra et al .",
    "@xcite tested the capabilities of 240 skyrme interaction parameter sets , finding that only 5 of these forces satisfied such constraints .",
    "given the sensitivity of the outcomes of ccsn simulations to the nuclear matter eos the best models of nuclear matter drawn from such studies should be used .",
    "the work in this paper follows previous work @xcite in which the pasta phases of ccsn matter were studied using the 3dshf method .",
    "the goal of this work is to use the latest constraints on the skyrme energy - density functional to characterize the phase transition between the pasta phases and the uniform phase , where all phases are allowed to emerge self - consistently using a number of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we seek to compare the resulting phase transitions with those that arise from studying the thermodynamic spinodal with the same underlying nuclear interactions , in order to assess the impact of a consistent description of the pasta phases on the density and temperature range of stability of the uniform phase .",
    "we selected four different interactions , skm * @xcite , sly4 @xcite , nrapr @xcite and sqmc700 @xcite , based on their overall performance in modeling of a wide variety of nuclear matter properties @xcite .    in section [ ii ] , we briefly define phase transition and describe its possible characters and in section [ iii ] , the numerical method is explained . in section [ iv ] , we present and discuss the results obtained and , finally , in section [ v ] , some conclusions are drawn .",
    "the equilibrium state of a homogeneous body is determined by specifying any two thermodynamic quantities , for example the volume @xmath12 and the energy @xmath13 .",
    "there is , however , no reason to suppose that for every given pair of values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 the state of the body corresponding to thermal equilibrium will be homogeneous .",
    "it may be that for a given volume and energy in thermal equilibrium the body is not homogeneous , but separates into two homogeneous parts in contact which are in different states .",
    "such states of matter that can exist simultaneously in equilibrium with one another and in contact are described as different phases @xcite .",
    "phase transitions which are connected with an entropy discontinuity are called discontinuous or phase transitions of first order . on the other hand , phase transitions across which the entropy is continuous are either continuous or of second or higher order .    for a first - order phase transition ,",
    "at least one of the first derivatives of the free energy with respect to one of its variables is discontinuous @xcite : @xmath14 @xmath15 this discontinuity produces a divergence in the higher derivatives like the specific heat @xmath16 , or the incompressibility @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the energy per particle of symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .    for a phase transition of second ( or @xmath19th order ) , the first derivatives of the free energy are continuous ; however , second ( or @xmath19th order ) derivatives , like the specific heat or the susceptibility , are discontinuous or divergent .",
    "the transition to superconductivity without an external magnetic field is an example of phase transitions of this kind @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will examine the mediation of the transition between inhomogeneous and homogeneous of nuclear matter at finite temperature by the nuclear pasta phases .      in order to analyze the impact of the existence of the pasta phases on the stability of uniform matter",
    ", we will calculate the thermodynamical spinodals for the skyrme interactions used following the method outlined in ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "matter is stable to fluctuations in density and composition , under conditions of constant volume and temperature , when the free energy density @xmath20 is a convex function of the proton and neutron densities .",
    "these densities are associated with the chemical potentials @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the free energy curvature is given by @xmath23 the eigenvalues of this matrix are given by @xmath24 and the eigenvectors by @xmath25    the thermodynamical spinodal region is then defined to be that region of @xmath26 space for which @xmath27 .",
    "matter in the spinodal region will separate into two phases : a low density gas phase and a higher density liquid phase .",
    "the higher density boundary of the spinodal gives an estimate for the transition density to uniform matter ; given that the spinodal analysis neglects the competition between the coulomb energy and surface energies of the two - phase system , that estimate is expected to provide a low limit on the transition density . by comparing the spinodal region with a fully microscopic calculation of the pasta phases up to the transition density , we will be able to evaluate the difference between that lower limit and the actual transition density .",
    "as stated in section [ i ] , we use a 3dshf approximation with a phenomenological skyrme model for the nuclear force . in the calculation",
    ", it is assumed that , at a given density and temperature , matter is arranged in a periodic structure throughout a sufficiently large region of space for a unit cell to be identified , in which the microscopic and bulk properties of the matter are calculated .",
    "the calculation is performed in cubic cells with periodic boundary conditions and assuming reflection symmetry across the three cartesian axes .",
    "the required reflection symmetry allows us to obtain solutions only in one octant of the unit cell , which reduces significantly the computer time .",
    "the only effect of confining ourselves to @xmath28 of the cell is that we can only consider triaxial shapes .",
    "it is expected that the absolute minimum of the free energy of a cell containing @xmath29 nucleons is not going to be particularly pronounced and there will be a host of local minima separated by relatively small energy differences . in order to systematically survey the  shape space \" of all nuclear configurations of interest , the quadrupole moment of the neutron density distributions",
    "has been parametrized , and those parameters constrained .",
    "it is expected that the proton distribution follows closely that of the neutrons .",
    "the minimum of the free energy in a cell at a given particle number density , temperature and a proton fraction is sought as a function of 3 free parameters , the number of particles in the cell ( determining the cell size ) and the parameters of the quadrupole moment of the neutron distribution @xmath30 .",
    "each minimization takes approximately 12 hours on a single cpu core in computers like the national center for computational sciences ( nccs ) cray xt5/xk6 machine at ornl and is performed in a trivially parallel mode , typically using 45,000 processors in one run to perform separate minimizations over a range of densities @xmath31 @xmath1 , temperatures @xmath32 mev and a fixed proton fraction of @xmath33 , where we have spent approximately @xmath34 cpu hours .",
    "we shall refer generally to this implementation and computation as the 3dshf model .",
    "full computational details can be found in @xcite .",
    "we show in table [ tab1 ] the nuclear matter properties for the four skyrme models we use in this study , nrapr , sqmc700 , skm@xmath0 and sly4 .",
    "we chose two traditional forces , skm * and sly4 , and two forces , nrapr and sqmc700 , which successfully satisfied up - to - date experimental and observational constraints on properties of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "these four forces span the range of saturation - density symmetry energy slope @xmath9 obtained from the concordance of a variety of experimental probes @xmath11mev .",
    "we also show the nuclear matter properties of another model to which we will compare our results , the widely used lattimer - swesty ( ls ) eos @xcite .",
    ".nuclear matter properties at saturation density @xmath35 ( energy per particle @xmath36 , incompressibility @xmath37 , symmetry energy @xmath38 and symmetry energy slope @xmath9 ) for the models studied .",
    "all the quantities are in mev , except for @xmath35 , given in @xmath39 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a self - consistent 3d - hartree - fock calculation which includes coulomb , surface and quantum finite size effects and allows for an unbiased exploration of all possible triaxial nuclear pasta structures has been performed for proton fractions @xmath40 and temperatures @xmath41 mev relevant to core - collapse supernovae . using this model ,",
    "we have studied the transitions between the pasta phases and to uniform matter .",
    "we see a clear indication of a first order phase transition to uniform matter , manifesting itself as discontinuities in thermodynamic quantities such as the pressure , entropy and chemical potentials .",
    "we were able to identify jumps ( of the order of @xmath42 mev ) in all the first derivatives of the free energy .",
    "the inclusion of the pasta phase in our model hence does not remove the first order phase transition to uniform matter .",
    "discontinuities in the first derivatives of the free energy density at lower densities are also present , indicating possible small first - order transitions between the pasta phases , but are too small to be identified unambiguously owing to the numerical accuracy of the computational framework . however we can observe that they happen gradually , with increasing density , and that first - order phase transitions between the pasta phases are likely weak at most .",
    "we find that the current range of uncertainty in the symmetry energy at saturation density has only a small effect on the transition density to uniform matter , which otherwise can be taken to be well - determined .",
    "the difference between the transition densities for all skyrmes , at all temperatures considered here , is around 0.005 @xmath1 .",
    "however , a comparison of the results of our 3dshf calculations with the spinodal analysis leads us to conclude that short - range coulomb correlations and quantum shell effects stabilize structures that would otherwise be unstable .",
    "this leads to a modification in the transition density compared with that obtained using the spinodals , with the spinodal method underestimating the densities by up to @xmath43@xmath1 at the lowest temperatures .",
    "this difference becomes progressively smaller at higher temperatures , becoming negligible at @xmath44mev .",
    "it is possible that degrees of freedom not taken into count in the mean - field 3dshf calculations can modify our conclusions .",
    "particularly , the fact that we see a decrease in the chemical potential with the density , indicates that our description of the pasta phase , with heavy clusters and a background gas , may be missing some degrees of freedom that will maximize the entropy ( see @xcite ) , and that such a continuous mixture may soften the first - order phase transition we observe .",
    "the results of this work , extended to relevant temperatures and proton / neutron ratios , can be used to construct four eos for supernova simulation models , augmented by 1d calculation at densities below and above the pasta region .",
    "neutron and proton density distributions in the unit cell , obtained in this work , can also be employed in the modeling of neutrino transport through the pasta formations . at low momentum transfers the static structure factor",
    "is found to be small because of ion screening .",
    "in contrast , at intermediate momentum transfers the static structure factor displays a large peak due to coherent scattering from all the neutrons in a cluster .",
    "this peak moves to higher momentum transfers and decreases in amplitude as the density increases @xcite . a large static structure factor at zero momentum transfer , indicative of large density fluctuations during a first - order phase transition , may increase the neutrino opacity .",
