    "supergiants are the descendants of massive o and b - type main sequence stars . unlike their main sequence progenitors ,",
    "cool supergiants are characterized by a helium - burning core and a deep convective envelope .",
    "due to their extended radii , low - atmospheric densities , slow rotation and long convective turnover times , supergiants provide an opportunity to study stellar magnetism at the extremes of parameter space .",
    "in fact , observations of late - type supergiants show characteristics consistent with magnetic activity , such as luminous x - ray emission and flaring , and emission in chromospheric uv lines - phenomena suggesting the presence of dynamo - driven magnetic fields .    motivated by the activity - related puzzles of late - type supergiants , the near complete lack of direct constraints on their magnetic fields , and recent success of measuring fields of red and yellow giants ( e.g. aurire et al .",
    "2008 ) , we have initiated a program to search for direct evidence of magnetic fields in these massive , evolved stars . here",
    "we summarize the recent results of grunhut et al .",
    "circular polarization ( stokes @xmath0 ) spectra were obtained with the high - resolution ( r@xmath168000 ) espadons and narval spectropolarimeters at the canada - france - hawaii telescope and bernard lyot telescope , as part of a large survey investigating the magnetic properties of late - type supergiants .    to date , we have observed more than 30 stars : 4 a - type stars , 8 f - type stars , 11 g - type stars , 7 k - type stars , and 3 m - type stars .",
    "we applied the least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ; donati et al .",
    "1997 ) technique to all our data in order to increase the s / n and detect weak zeeman signatures .",
    "our investigation shows that many late - type supergiants host detectable stokes @xmath0 zeeman signatures , which are frequently complex .",
    "overall , we find that approximately 1/3 of our sample reveal detectable zeeman signatures in stokes @xmath0 .",
    "however , we find no clear differences between classical activity indicators ( such as caii h&k or h@xmath2 emission ) of those stars with or without detections .",
    "however , we do find a weak correlation between the caii core equivalent width and the magnetic field strength for those stars with multiple observations .",
    "in addition , we also see clear temporal variability of the stokes @xmath0 profiles for those targets with multiple observations ."
