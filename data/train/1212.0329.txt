    "the change in the diagonal resistance , @xmath12 , is exhibited vs. b in fig .",
    "1(c ) shows two noteworthy features : a high magnetic field resonance at @xmath13 tesla , and a low magnetic field feature at @xmath14 tesla .",

    "further , as indicated in fig .",
    "2(b),(e ) , microwave irradiation of these specimens produces a uniform negative displacement in the @xmath0 traces with increasing power . yet , the effect of microwave excitation ( @xmath18 at @xmath8 ) is again similar to heating the specimen ( @xmath17 ) , cf .",

    "note the shift of resonances to higher @xmath1 with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "figure 4(a ) presents a plot of the microwave frequency , @xmath27 , vs. the resonance magnetic fields , @xmath1 , extracted from fig .",
    "4(a ) shows that the resonance @xmath1-values for the three specimens collapse onto two lines : a gold - colored line in fig .",
    "4(a ) , which represents the high @xmath1-field resonances of fig .",

    "another line shown in magenta in fig .",
    "4(a ) , which represents the low - b resonances of fig .",
    "3 , exhibits a linear increase as @xmath29 , with a non - zero intercept , @xmath30 ghz .",
    "in such a plot , spin resonance for an electron with g - factor @xmath31 would follow : @xmath32 . thus , the observed slopes , @xmath33 ghz @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ghz @xmath34 ) for the low ( high ) field resonance correspond to spin resonances with @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the g - factors measured here are comparable to the g - values obtained from traditional esr - studies of graphite , which have indicated that the g - factor for @xmath38-axis , @xmath39 , increases from @xmath40 at @xmath41 k to @xmath42 at @xmath43 k , while , at @xmath44 k , the g - factor for @xmath45-axis , @xmath46.@xcite in graphite , the g - factor depends upon the orientation of the @xmath1 field , the temperature , the location of the fermi level , and the sign of the charge carriers , with opposite g - factor shifts , @xmath47 , from @xmath48 , for electrons and holes.@xcite the negative @xmath47 and reduced @xmath39 observed here relative to @xmath48 are consistent with expectation for holes .    from these data",
    ", we also estimate a resonance half - width @xmath49 tesla , which corresponds to a spin relaxation time @xmath50 s. the spin relaxation time has been a topic of great interest in graphene .",
    "spin relaxation @xcite has been experimentally studied in monolayer and bilayer exfoliated graphene on @xmath51@xcite and , more recently , on epitaxial graphene @xcite using spin valve devices , and possible mechanisms involved in spin relaxation have been examined by theory.@xcite for monolayer exfoliated graphene , observed spin relaxation times generally fall in the range of 40 - 150 ps ( refs @xcite ) while exfoliated bilayer graphene exhibits spin relaxation times as long as 2 - 6 ns ( refs @xcite ) .",
    "the observed shorter - than - expected spin lifetime in exfoliated monolayer graphene has been attributed to extrinsic mechanisms based on impurity adatoms,@xcite charged impurities and phonons from the substrate,@xcite spin orbit coupling due to ripples in graphene,@xcite and so on . note that the @xmath52 reported here for @xmath53-face epitaxial",
    "graphene is comparable to previous reports of the spin relaxation time for monolayer exfoliated graphene on @xmath51 .",
    "the spin - diffusion length here is @xmath54,@xcite while the hall bar width , @xmath55 . here",
    ", @xmath56 is the diffusion constant . in such a situation",
    ", edges could be playing a role in spin relaxation , given that edges in graphene can be magnetically active,@xcite and the electrical contacts include gold , a heavy element .",
    "thus , there could to be additional avenues for spin relaxation in the small specimen , in addition to the other above - mentioned mechanisms.@xcite finally , inhomogeneities could serve to broaden the resonance linewidth and help to produce an apparently reduced spin relaxation time .",
    "the observation of similar double resonances in monolayer- and trilayer- graphene can be viewed as a consequence of rotational ( non - ab ) layer stacking in epitaxial graphene , which makes it possible even for multilayer eg to exhibit the same electronic properties as isolated graphene.@xcite note also that sub - lattice or pseudo - spin degeneracy lifting is known to occur at high - b in graphene.@xcite for example , the progression of quantum hall effect from the @xmath57 = @xmath58^{-1}$ ] @xmath59 sequence,@xcite to observations of @xmath60 increases in steps of @xmath61 ( ref @xcite ) reflects the lifting of both the spin- and pseudo - spin- degeneracy .",
    "in addition , a non - linear interaction - enhanced valley - degeneracy splitting has been reported from a scanning tunneling spectroscopy study.@xcite finally , the manifestation of weak localization , which is observable in fig . 1 and 2 , is an indicator of inter - valley coupling in these specimens.@xcite since sub - lattice degeneracy splitting is not unexpected due to the above , the observed @xmath30 ghz is attributed to a zero - magnetic - field pseudo - spin ( sub - lattice degeneracy ) splitting of @xmath62 ev .    a provisional interpretation of the f vs. b plot of fig .",
    "4(a ) is provided in fig .",
    "chiral eigenstates and linear energy - wavevector dispersion characterize carriers in graphene .",
    "the application of a b - field nominally produces fourfold , valley- and spin- degenerate landau - levels characterized by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the electron charge , @xmath66 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath67 is the reduced planck s constant .    we imagine the four - fold degeneracy being lifted by @xmath68 even at @xmath69 , to produce energy doublets as @xmath70 .",
    "then , owing to the zeeman effect , associated landau levels exhibit a further splitting of the spin - degeneracy as @xmath71 . observed microwave - induced transitions occur within the highest occupied landau level in the vicinity of the fermi level . as @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we remove the @xmath74 term and plot @xmath75 in fig",
    ". 4(b ) .",
    "here , microwave photo - excitation induces spin - flip transitions , shown in gold , of unpaired carriers between the spin - levels of the lower or the upper doublet .",
    "such transitions require vanishing photon energy in the limit of vanishing @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , a transition between the lower spin ( `` up '' ) level of the lower doublet and the higher spin ( `` down '' ) level of the upper doublet requires additional energy @xmath68 , and such a transition , shown in magenta , exhibits non - vanishing photon energy in the @xmath76 limit .",
    "thus , the @xmath27 vs. @xmath1 plot appears consistent with spin resonance and a zero - field pseudo - spin ( valley - degeneracy ) splitting enhanced spin resonance .    in summary , we have realized the resistive detection of spin resonance in eg , provided a measurement of the g - factor and the spin relaxation time , and identified- and measured- a pseudo - spin ( valley degeneracy)-splitting in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "such resistive resonance detection can potentially serve to directly characterize the spin properties of dirac fermions , and also help to determine- and tune- the valley degeneracy splitting for spin based qc .",
    "* graphene samples .",
    "* epitaxial graphene ( eg ) was realized by the thermal decomposition of insulating 4h silicon carbide ( sic).@xcite the eg specimens were characterized by ellipsometry and the extracted layer thickness was converted to the number of layers at the rate of 0.335 nm / layer .",
    "the c - face of the eg / sic chip was processed by e - beam lithography into micron - sized hall bars with pd / au contacts .",
    "measurements are reported here for three hall bar specimens labeled 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "sample 1 is nominally trilayer graphene , while samples 2 and 3 are monolayer graphene .",
    "the samples are p - type with a hole concentration , @xmath77 , and a carrier mobility @xmath78",
    ".    * measurement configuration .",
    "* typically , an epitaxial graphene hall bar specimen was mounted at the end of a long straight section of wr-62 rectangular microwave waveguide .",
    "the waveguide with sample was inserted into the bore of a superconducting solenoid , immersed in pumped liquid helium , and irradiated with microwaves over the frequency range @xmath79 ghz , at a source - power @xmath80 mw , as in the usual microwave - irradiated transport experiment.@xcite here , the applied external magnetic field was oriented along the solenoid and waveguide axis as a probe coupled antenna launcher excited the transverse electric ( te-10 ) mode in the waveguide .",
    "thus , the microwave electric field was oriented perpendicular to the applied external magnetic field .",
    "the microwave magnetic field lines formed closed loops , with components in the transverse and axial directions of the waveguide .",

    "<S> the microwave control and electrical detection of spin have become topics of interest , now in graphene nanostructures,@xcite where the small number of spins limits the utility of traditional spin resonance .    here , we report the first observation of resistive detection of spin resonance in epitaxial graphene,@xcite provide a measurement of the g - factor and the spin relaxation time , and determine the pseudo - spin ( valley - degeneracy)-splitting at zero - magnetic - field . </S>",
    "<S> such resistive resonance detection can potentially serve to directly characterize the spin properties of dirac fermions , and also help to determine- and tune- the valley degeneracy splitting for spin based qc . </S>"
