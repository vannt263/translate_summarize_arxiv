    "low - mass and low - surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , including in this definition both dwarf ellipticals and irregulars , have since long surged to a central role in the general debate about galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "these objects , typically characterized by an absolute blue magnitude fainter than @xmath10 and a mean surface brightness @xmath11  mag  arcsec@xmath12 @xcite , display in fact a quite wide range of morphological and spectrophotometric properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) such as to rise the question whether they assume an individual role as a sort of pristine building blocks to form more massive systems ( as in the cdm theoretical scheme , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or they rather originate as coarse `` by - products '' of the formation of `` standard '' ellipticals and spirals @xcite .",
    "the problem of the genetic signature of low - mass systems is not a negligible one as , although in a more silent way , dwarf galaxies display in many cases continuous star formation activity , which makes them possible efficient `` engines '' to enrich the interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "actually , a major problem in this framework resides in the apparent dichotomy between active ongoing star formation , widely observed in lsb galaxies , and the exceedingly low metallicity of their present - day stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the most striking case in this context is surely that of izw  18 , as recently discussed by @xcite .",
    "again , while for some dwarf ellipticals we might be dealing with a somewhat quiescent evolutionary scenario , reminiscent of old globular cluster history , in other situations a `` tuned '' star formation could have proceeded allover the entire galaxy life ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) still leaving , nowadays , an important fraction of fresh ( primordial ? ) gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as far as galaxy spatial distribution is concerned , the ubiquitous presence of lsb irregulars in the different cosmic environments @xcite is clearly at odds with the morphology - density relation @xcite , which has been proven to hold for `` standard '' galaxies for a wide range of densities and scales @xcite .",
    "a systematic observational work to map the lsb galaxy distribution in selected zones of the sky has been carried out by different teams , leading to complete surveys and morphological catalogues of some loose groups of galaxies and nearby clusters @xcite .",
    "these morphological surveys serve as a basic reference to any further spectrophotometric analysis of individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , efficient detection and accurate observation of lsb galaxies still remain a formidable task , even for hst observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) especially when moving to distances beyond the virgo and fornax clusters , the two best studied aggregates so far ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a complementary view may be gained through the study of smaller groups .",
    "in fact , the wide range of densities which characterizes these aggregates makes them the natural link between galaxy clusters and the field .",
    "detailed mapping of the distribution and nature of low - mass galaxies in small groups will fill the `` void '' between fully relaxed systems ( like actually the case of ngc 5044 group , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) to very loose and possibly unbound aggregates @xcite . besides probing the properties of dwarf galaxies in different environments , these have the advantage that even a moderate - sized sample would be fairly representative of the whole group population . at the same time ,",
    "depth effects would be minimized allowing a better analysis of distance - dependent quantities .    in this work",
    "we want to further follow up a long - range study on the low - mass lsb galaxy population of the ngc  5044 group .",
    "in particular , after assessing group morphology and membership in previous contributions @xcite , we would like to tackle here the problem of galaxy evolutionary properties , according to a multiwavelength observational approach that includes integrated and surface - brightness multicolour photometry , further complemented in most cases with a spectroscopic input . our analysis will rely on original stellar population synthesis models , to which refer galaxy data in order to lead to a convenient and physically self - consistent picture of the galaxy evolutionary status for the ngc  5044 group .    in this framework",
    ", we will arrange our discussion by presenting the observed database in sec .  2 .",
    "its morphological characterization will be carried out in sec .  3 by fitting galaxy surface brightness with a @xcite profile .",
    "these results in most cases refine our previous discussion in @xcite leading also to a homogeneous morphological classification of the full galaxy population in the ngc  5044 group . together with up - to - date redshift measurements , the revised morphological parameters proved to be a useful additional piece of information to constrain group membership and eventually assess the overall physical properties of the galaxy group as a whole . as a central step in this direction , in sec .",
    "4 we study galaxy distribution in different magnitude and colour domains . starting from apparent magnitudes and morphological types , a match with the @xcite template galaxy models also allows us to lead to a realistic estimate of galaxy stellar mass and a reference birthrate figure for the galaxy group as a whole .    the spectroscopic properties for our sample are finally discussed in some detail in sec .  5 , where lick narrow - band indices are derived for most of the observed galaxies .",
    "the diagnostic diagrams compare @xmath9-element features , like magnesium and calcium , versus iron and balmer line stregth , also including the contribution from carbon molecules like ch ( g band ) and c@xmath13 .",
    "we will discuss our results and summarize our main conclusions in sec .",
    "our galaxy sample consists of a total of 79 mostly dwarf and lsb galaxies , mainly selected from the @xcite catalogs , and representative of the faint galaxy population surrounding the standard elliptical ngc  5044 , in the range @xmath14 mag , can be estimated , according to the mean spectroscopic redshift of all group members in @xcite . for @xmath15",
    "kms@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 this leads to a value of @xmath16  mag , that we will adopt throughout this paper . ] regardless of morphology .",
    "johnson @xmath17 photometry and @xmath18 imaging in the gunn system @xcite , as well as mid - resolution ( @xmath19 - 1000 ) spectroscopy for a subsample of 24 objects have been collected during different observing runs from 1996 to 2000 .",
    "specifically , 40 objects have been observed during two observing campaigns ( on the nights of apr 16 - 17 , 1999 and apr 29-may 1 , 2000 ) at the eso 3.6 m telescope of la silla ( chile ) , while previous extended observations at the 2.15 m telescope of the observatory , in san juan ( argentina ) were carried out along three observing runs ( on the nights of may 10 - 13 1996 , apr 8 - 10 1997 , and mar 19 - 21 1999 ) providing supplementary data for 57 galaxies , 18 of which in common with the eso sample . ]",
    "eso observations have been carried out with efosc2 , equipped with a loral 2k ccd in a @xmath20 binned mode providing a platescale of 0.32  arcsec pixel@xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath21 field of view allowed in most cases to image more than one galaxy within each frame .",
    "a total of 24 fields were imaged in the @xmath18 bands ( see fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* for the exact location map ) , including 33 known low - luminosity galaxies , plus the bright sbi - ii ngc5054 , ngc  5044 itself , and 6 newly discovered lsb galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "atmospheric conditions were photometric all the way , with sub - arcsec seeing during the first run , and a poorer performance ( fwhm @xmath22  arcsec ) in the 2000 run . in case of multiple exposures , a final image of the field",
    "was obtained by stacking the individual frames after all processing steps were completed .",
    "standard stars from the lists of @xcite and @xcite were also observed during each run for calibration purposes .",
    "johnson @xmath17 imaging at the casleo telescope has been carried out , on the other hand , during two runs in 1996 and 1999 .",
    "the telescope was equipped with a tektronix 1024@xmath231024 ccd , providing a 9@xmath24 circular field of view in direct - imaging mode , with a platescale of 0.83  arcsec pixel@xmath6 .",
    "standard stars for magnitude calibration were selected from the list of @xcite .",
    "seeing conditions were typically poorer than eso observations , ranging between 2.0 and 2.8 arcsec .",
    "partial results from the 1996 data have been presented in @xcite .",
    "image processing of both eso and casleo data was done using iraf , complemented with a few of our own fortran routines .",
    "each bias - corrected frame was twilight flat - fielded , while residual fringe patterns on eso @xmath25 and @xmath26 images were corrected , mostly within a final @xmath27% accuracy level , by subtraction of the appropriate templates ( see * ? ? ? * for more details on the procedure ) .",
    "cosmic rays were cleaned up using the iraf task cosmicrays , and the sky background , fitted with a tilted plane , was finally subtracted to obtain the final images of each field .",
    "the photometric reduction procedure yielded a nominal figure ( @xmath28  mag ) for the internal magnitude uncertainty of bright galaxies , being the total photometric error dominated throughout by the external uncertainty in the zero - point calibration .",
    "overall , for a @xmath29 galaxy we estimate a full magnitude uncertainty of the order of @xmath30  mag , a figure that may raise to @xmath31  mag for the faintest ( @xmath32 ) objects ( @xmath33  mag for casleo data ) .",
    "a check of internal self - consistency of the @xmath17 photometry has been made possible by the combined observations of galaxies n49 ( @xmath34 ) and n83a ( @xmath35 ) , in common to the 1996 and 1999 runs .",
    "for the first bright object , the coincidence was excellent , as both @xmath36 and @xmath37 isophotal magnitudes and surface brightness have been reproduced within @xmath38  mag , and @xmath39  mag  arcsec@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "much poorer is the match of n83a , instead , a very faint dsph galaxy . in the latter case , in fact , repeated @xmath37 photometry resulted in a nearly negligible offset of 0.06  mag , that raised however to 0.35  mag for the @xmath36 band .",
    "a similar figure has been found for the surface - brightness measurements , with a difference of 0.002 and 0.45  mag  arcsec@xmath12 in @xmath37 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "this warns of the fact that photometric parameters of very faint galaxies may actually show considerable errors .      in order to ease a more homogenous discussion of the whole galaxy sample",
    "one would like to convert casleo @xmath17 photometry into eso gunn system .",
    "to this aim we took advantage of the 18 galaxies in common between the two subsamples , as summarized in table  [ t1 ] . for these galaxies , integrated magnitudes within one @xmath40-effective radius , as identified by the srsic fitting profile ( see table  [ a2 ] ) , have been computed matching casleo @xmath17 and eso @xmath41 photometry .",
    "the linear fit to these data is reported in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "one has to remark , however , that the strong clustering of the data in the colour domain ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) , poorly constrains the relations of transformation .",
    "alternatively , more standard sets of empirical conversion relationships can be found in the literature , mainly relying on the observation of stellar grids .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the works by @xcite and @xcite , also reported in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "a further set of fully theoretical conversion equations has been considered in the table , relying on the @xcite template galaxy models .",
    "the latter calibration may in principle be more suitable for our aims , as it better accounts for the slightly different locus of stars and galaxies in the colour domain , given the `` broader '' spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the latter ."
