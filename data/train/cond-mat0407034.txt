    "materials with large spin polarization are required for applications in the field of spinelectronics . in this sense ,",
    "research on compounds which are expected to be half - metals , i.e. with 100 % spin polarization , is of special interest .",
    "half metals ( hms ) are expected to have a gap at e@xmath3 for one spin band while the other spin band is metallic leading to a completely polarized current .",
    "the use of hm electrodes in spin valves or in magnetic tunneling junctions ( mtjs ) will result in a pronounced increase of the magnetoresistance .",
    "the full heusler alloy co@xmath4cr@xmath0fe@xmath1al is expected to be a hm .",
    "it is used as an electrode in this work , further information on this compound can be found in @xcite . following the jullire model @xcite , the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) ratio of a junction",
    "is related to the spin polarization @xmath5 of the electrodes : @xmath6 please note that in this definition the tmr ratio is normalized to the value of resistance in the antiparallel configuration .",
    "the jullire model is not able to explain certain features of mtjs like the temperature and bias voltage dependence of the tunneling magnetoresistance . in expression ( [ tmr ] ) , @xmath7 stands for the polarization of the bulk material , but the tunneling conductivity is only sensitive to the local density of states in the vicinity of the barrier which may differ from the one of the bulk material .",
    "additionally , the jullire model does not take into account the various direct effects of the barrier on the tunneling probability @xcite .",
    "however , the model is commonly used to estimate the spin polarization of the electrodes .",
    "first attempts of building mtjs with half metallic electrodes were discouraging due to the low tmr obtained compared to the theoretically expected value for @xmath8 100% spin polarization @xcite .",
    "recently , a tmr ratio of 16 % at room temperature and 26.5 % at 4k with co@xmath4cr@xmath0fe@xmath1al as an electrode was reported @xcite .",
    "differential resistivity of a co@xmath4cr@xmath0fe@xmath1al/ alo@xmath9/co junction at room temperature and 77k .",
    "the inset shows the dependence of the tmr ratio on the temperature . a bias voltage of 1 mv was applied . ]",
    "the junctions were deposited by magnetron dc sputtering in a chamber with a base pressure of @xmath1010@xmath11 mbar on al@xmath4o@xmath12 ( 1120 ) substrates .",
    "they were deposited in a cross geometry using metal shadow masks with a width of 150 and 300 @xmath13 m .",
    "the structure of the layers of the junction is ccfa / alo@xmath9/co where ccfa stands for co@xmath4cr@xmath0fe@xmath1al .",
    "no pinning system was used , the antiparallel configuration is achieved due to the different coercive fields of the electrodes .",
    "the film thickness was determined by x - ray reflectometry .",
    "the minimum thickness of the ccfa electrode was chosen to be 125 nm in order to reduce the resistance of the bottom electrode .",
    "it must be emphasized that , due to the high specific resistivity of the heusler compound ( @xmath14 = 230@xmath15 cm @xcite ) , thick layers are needed to discard geometrical enhancement of the tmr ratio @xcite .",
    "the aluminum layer was oxidized using plasma oxidation at 0.2 mbar with oxidation times between 120s and 180s .",
    "oxidation times below 120s result in low junction resistances ( below 175@xmath16 and it is not possible to discard current distribution effects . the co layer was deposited with a thickness of 200 nm .",
    "ccfa films with best crystallographic properties are grown at 600@xmath17c .",
    "however , the first attempts of depositing mtjs were done at room temperature to obtain smooth surfaces to grow a good insulating barrier .",
    "increased deposition temperatures have not shown large changes in the tmr signal up to 400@xmath17c .",
    "the preparation of mtjs at temperatures over 400@xmath17c resulted in very low or inexistent tmr signal .",
    "possible reasons are an increased roughness of the surface of the heusler film and an enhanced degradation of the surface due to oxygen impurities in the sputtering gas .",
    "dependence of the differential conductivity on the bias voltage .",
    "the parabolic behavior is a characteristic of tunneling .",
    "the solid line represents the fit to the simmons model . the averaged height ( @xmath18 ) and the effective width ( s ) of the barrier",
    "are given in volts and ngstrms , respectively .",
    "x@xmath19 is the offset of the parabola from zero bias . ]",
    "the maximum tmr ratio observed was 10.8 % at 4k and 6 % at room temperature . the magnetoresistive curves for 77k and room temperature",
    "are shown in fig.[mr ] .",
    "the heusler electrode was deposited at 300@xmath17c and the oxidation time was 180s .",
    "the sharpness of the peaks is an indication for the similarity of the coercive fields of the two electrodes .",
    "it is very probable that a full antiparallel configuration is not achieved resulting in a reduced tmr amplitude . in order to prevent current distribution effects the quotient between the resistance of the junction ( @xmath20 ) and the resistance of the electrodes over the junction area ( @xmath21 )",
    "must be much larger than 1 .",
    "this was always the case for our junctions . in the case of the junction shown in fig.[mr ]",
    "the value is @xmath22 .",
    "previous results of tunneling with the ccfa compound show a larger tmr effect @xcite with a thickness for the ccfa of 10 nm and a junction resistance of 140@xmath23 . from our experience with the high specific resistivity of the heusler films these values",
    "might result in a geometrical enhancement of the tmr ratio .",
    "vsm measurements of the magnetization of the samples .",
    "the graphs show the hysteresis cycles for a junction deposited with shadows masks ( a ) and a heusler film deposited on a 5x5 mm@xmath24 substrate covered with an oxidized al layer ( b ) . ]",
    "a study of the dependence of the differential conductivity di / dv on the bias voltage was performed for every junction to assure that tunneling was the main conduction channel .",
    "the parabolic behavior shown in fig.[simmons ] for the same junction which provided the results of fig.[mr ] is an indication of tunneling . from a fit using the simmons model",
    "@xcite we can extract the characteristic parameters of this junction .",
    "the effective width of the barrier was s = 35 with an average height @xmath25 = 0.6v . in all measurements",
    "it is observed that the parabola is not centered at zero bias but has a small offset between 3 and 4 mv .",
    "this offset may result from an asymmetry of the barrier .",
    "several samples were analyzed in a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) .",
    "the hysteresis cycle for the junction of fig.[mr ] is shown in fig.[vsm]a .",
    "the current leads were removed by cutting the substrate with a diamond saw .",
    "a small part of the leads could not be removed , this part had a length smaller than 1 mm .",
    "the offset in the magnetization axis may be a result of an electronic drift due to the low signal of the junction .",
    "the reason for the low signal is the small area of the sample . in the graph",
    "it is not possible to see a completely independent switching of the magnetization of the layers , in correspondence with the sharpness of the peaks in the magnetoresistivity measurements . a heusler film with the same thickness as the junction was deposited on a 5x5 mm@xmath24 substrate .",
    "the film was covered with an al layer and then oxidized to create the same conditions as in the deposition of a junction .",
    "the hysteresis cycle for this sample is shown in fig.[vsm]b . by comparison of the two plots",
    "it is deduced that the layer of ccfa switches sharply at relatively small magnetic fields .",
    "the switching of the co layer is broader and at higher magnetic fields .",
