    "the discovery of microwave induced magnetorersistance oscillations ( mimos ) and zero - resistance states ( zrs ) in high - mobility two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas ( eg)@xcite has stimulated tremendous experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite interest in radiation related magneto - transport in 2d electron systems . since theoretically it has been shown that the zrs can be the result of the instability induced by absolute negative resistivity,@xcite the majority of microscopic models focus mainly on mimos in spatially uniform cases and identify the region where an negative dissipative magnetoresistance develops as that of measured zero resistance .",
    "most of previous investigations concentrated on the range of low magnetic fields @xmath0 ( @xmath1 stands for the cyclotron frequency ) subject to a radiation of frequency @xmath2ghz , where mimos show up strongly and shubnikov - de haas oscillations ( sdhos ) are rarely appreciable . in spite of the fact that both mimos and sdhos are magnetoresistance related phenomena appearing in overlapping field regimes ,",
    "little attention was paid to the influence of a microwave radiation on sdho until a recent experimental finding at higher frequency.@xcite further observations clearly show that the amplitudes of sdhos are strongly affected by microwave radiations of different frequency in both low ( @xmath3 ) and high ( @xmath4 ) magnetic field ranges.@xcite kovalev _ et al._@xcite observed a suppression of the sdhos around cyclotron resonance @xmath5 induced by a radiation of 285ghz .",
    "et al._@xcite found strong modulations of sdho in an ultra - clean 2d sample subjected to microwaves of 146ghz , clearly showing , in addition to the first node at @xmath6 , higher order nodes around @xmath7 and 3 .",
    "mani@xcite reported strong modulation in the amplitude of sdhos accompanying mimos and zero - resistance states excited by a 163.5-ghz radiation and large dropoff of the dissipative resistivity below its dark value at high ( @xmath4 ) field side when subjected to low - frequency radiation .",
    "very recently , dorozhkin _",
    "et al._@xcite reported both the strong suppression of the magnetoresistance caused by radiation below 30ghz and an interesting modulation of sdhos in the range @xmath4 .",
    "they found that sdhos are generally strongly damped by the radiation but there is a narrow magnetic field range in between allowed ranges of inter- and intra - landau level transitions , where the amplitude of sdho is insensitive to the microwave irradiation .",
    "these observations provide a more complicated and appealing picture of the microwave - related transport phenomena , which must be accounted for in any theoretical model for mimos .    we propose that these sdho modulations come from the electron heating induced by the microwave radiation . under the illumination of microwave the electron system , which continuously absorbs energy from the radiation field ,",
    "would certainly be heated .",
    "unfortunately , the electron heating has so far been ignored in most of the theoretical treatments .",
    "the electron - acoustic phonon interaction was previously considered to contribute to landau - level broadening@xcite or to act as a damping@xcite for the orbit movement , providing a mechanism for the suppression of mimos when the lattice temperature increases .",
    "besides the inelastic electron - phonon scattering also plays another important role to dissipate energy from the electron system to the lattice .",
    "the energy absorption rate is indeed small in high - mobility electron systems at low temperature as in the experiments .",
    "this , however , does not imply a negligible electron heating , since the electron energy - dissipation rate is also small because of weak electron - phonon scattering at temperature @xmath8 k. to deal with sdho , which is very sensitive to the smearing of the electron distribution , one has to carefully calculate the electron heating due to microwave irradiation in a uniform model .    on the other hand",
    ", microwave irradiation heats the electrons and thus greatly strengthens the thermalizing trend of the system by enhancing the electron - electron scattering rate at this low temperature regime .",
    "this enables us to describe these high - mobility 2d electron systems with a quasi - equilibrium distribution in a moving reference frame .    in this paper",
    "we pursue a theoretical investigation on mimos and sdhos taking account of the electron heating under microwave irradiation .",
    "we generalize the balance equation approach to radiation - induced magnetotransport in high mobility two - dimensional electron systems . by carefully calculating the electron heating based on the balance of the energy absorption from the radiation field and the energy dissipation to the lattice through electron - phonon interactions in a typical gaas - based heterosystem and taking into account the electrodynamic effect ,",
    "we are able not only to reproduce the interesting phenomena of mimos in quantitative agreement with experiments in amplitudes , phases and radiation dependence of the oscillation , but also to obtain sdho modulations observed in the experiments .",
    "this paper is concerned with the magnetotransport in a microscopically homogeneous 2d system , and refers the measured zero resistance to the macroscopic consequence of the instability due to the occurrence of negative dissipative resistivity .",
    "we consider @xmath9 electrons in a unit area of an infinite quasi-2d system in the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane with a confining potential @xmath12 in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "these electrons , in addition to interacting with each other , are scattered by random impurities and/or disorders and by phonons in the lattice . within the magnetic field range relevant to mimo phenomenon ,",
    "the experiments exclude the onset of the quantum hall effect , thus allowing us to assume that the 2d electrons are in extended states .    to include possible elliptically polarized microwave illumination we assume that a dc electric field @xmath14 and a high - frequency ( hf ) ac field of angular frequency @xmath15 , @xmath16 are applied inside the 2d system in the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane , together with a magnetic field @xmath17 along the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the spatial homogeneity of the fields and the parabolic band structure allows to describe the transport of this system in terms of its center - of - mass ( c.m . ) motion and the relative motion , i.e. the motion of electrons in the reference frame moving with the c.m.@xcite the center - of - mass momentum and coordinate of the 2d electron system are defined as @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the momentum and coordinate of the @xmath22th electron in the 2d plane , respectively , and the relative electron momentum and coordinate are defined as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . in terms of these variables ,",

    "these quantities are directly related to the time - averaged and/or base - frequency oscillating components of the c.m . velocity . although higher harmonics of the current may affect the dc and lower harmonic terms of the drift velocity through entering the damping force and energy exchange rates in the resulting equations , in an ordinary semiconductor the power of even the third harmonic current is rather weak as compared to the fundamental current . for the hf field intensity in the mimo experiments ,",
    "the effect of higher harmonic current is safely negligible .",

    "we assume that the electromagnetic wave is incident perpendicularly ( along @xmath13-axis ) upon 2deg from the vacuum with the incident electric field of @xmath133 at plane @xmath134 .",
    "the relation between @xmath132 and @xmath135 is easily obtained by solving the maxwell equations connecting both sides of the 2deg which is carrying a sheet current density @xmath136 .",

    "however , since the dos of each landau level is assumed to be gaussian rather than a clear cutoff function and the multi - photon processes also play roles , the transition boundaries between different regimes may be somewhat smeared .",
    "as indicated by experiments,@xcite although long range scattering due to remote donors always exists in the 2d heterostructures , in ultra - clean gaas - based 2d samples having mobility of order of @xmath160m@xmath61/vs , the remote donor scattering is responsible for merely @xmath161 or less of the total momentum scattering rate .",
    "the dominant contribution to the momentum scattering rate comes from short - range scatterers such as residual impurities or defects in the background .",
    "furthermore , even with the same momentum scattering rate the remote impurity scattering is much less efficient in contributing to microwave - induced magnetoresistance oscillations than short - ranged background impurities or defects.@xcite therefore , in the numerical calculations in this paper we assume that the elastic scatterings are due to short - range impurities randomly distributed throughout the gaas region .",
    "the impurity densities are determined by the requirement that electron total linear mobility at zero magnetic field equals the giving value at lattice temperature @xmath101 .",

    "the enhanced effect of the virtual photon process , together with enhanced multiphoton - assisted electron transition , pushes the resistivity @xmath106 remarkably down below the average of its oscillatory curve without radiation , resulting in a strong suppression of dissipative magnetoresistance across a wide magnetic field range as shown in fig.5 , in agreement with experimental observations.@xcite      the radiation - induced sdho modulation can be seen clearly in the low magnetic field region @xmath217 with higher radiation frequency .",

    "these are in agreement with the experimental observation reported in ref ..      note that in gaas - based systems at a temperature around @xmath231k , la phonons generally give larger contribution to the electron energy dissipation @xmath94 than that from ta phonons and lo phonons are usually frozen . however , in the case of high radiation power or in the vicinity of @xmath232 , where the resonantly absorbed energy can be relatively large and the electron temperature can rise up above 20k , a weak emission of lo phonons takes place .",
    "though at this temperature the number of excited lo phonons is still very small and their contribution to momentum relaxation ( resitivity ) is negligible in comparison with acoustic phonons , they can already provide an efficient energy dissipation because each excited lo phonon contributes a huge energy transfer of @xmath233k . with a continuing rise of electron temperature the lo - phonon contribution increases rapidly .",
