    "the study of quantum games combines the laws of quantum mechanics with game theory .",
    "it is interesting to study the games at microscopic level where the laws of quantum mechanics dictates the dynamics .",
    "quantum games offer additional strategies to the players and resolve dilemmas that occur in classical games [ 16 ] .",
    "quantum theory has already been applied to a wide variety of games [ 711 ] and shown to be experimentally feasible [ 12 ] .",
    "additionally , quantum games offer a new paradigm for exploring the fascinating world of quantum information [ 1315 ] .",
    "meyer [ 16 ] has also pointed out the connection between quantum games and quantum information processing . in the earlier work on quantum games , for simplicity ,",
    "the role of channels is mostly ignored . in a realistic setup , however , the flow of information between players and arbiter is subject to interaction with the environment . quantum entanglement , which is one of the interesting features of quantum mechanics , plays a crucial role in quantum information processing . when quantum information processing is performed in the real world , decoherence caused by an external environment is inevitable . in other words ,",
    "the influence of an external environmental system on the entanglement can not be ignored .",
    "recently , decoherence effects in quantum games have been studied [ 17 ] .",
    "later , interest has been developed to extend the theory of quantum channels to encompass memory effects [ 18 , 19 ] .",
    "there are time scales for which successive uses of channel are correlated and memory effects need to be taken into account .",
    "quantum computing in the presence of noise is possible with the use of decoherence - free subspaces [ 20 ] and quantum error correction [ 21 ] .",
    "studies concerning quantum games in the presence of decoherence and correlated noise have produced interesting results .",
    "chen et al [ 17 ] have shown that in the case of the game prisoner s dilemma , the nash equilibria are not changed by the effects of decoherence for maximally entangled states incorporating three prototype decoherence channels .",
    "recently , nawaz and toor [ 22 ] have shown for the quantum games based on quantum - correlated phase - damping channel that the quantum player only enjoys an advantage over the classical player when both the initial quantum state and the measurement basis are in entangled form .",
    "it is also shown that for maximum correlation the effects of decoherence diminish and it behaves as a noiseless game .",
    "recently , cao et al [ 23 ] have investigated the effect of quantum noise on a multiplayer quantum game .",
    "they have shown that in a maximally entangled case a special nash equilibrium appears for a specific range of quantum noise parameter .    in this paper , we study the quantum games based on three prototype quantum correlated channels ( qcc ) parameterized by a memory factor @xmath0 which measures the degree of correlations , in the context of generalized quantization scheme for non - zero sum games [ 24 ] . we identify four different regimes on the basis of initial state and measurement basis entanglement parameters , @xmath1",
    "$ ] and @xmath2 $ ] , respectively . for these four regimes ,",
    "we study the role of decoherence parameter @xmath3 $ ] and memory parameter @xmath4 $ ] for three quantum games .",
    "here , @xmath5 means that the measurement basis are unentangled and @xmath6 means that it is maximally entangled , @xmath7 means that the game is initially unentangled and @xmath8 means that it is maximally entangled .",
    "whereas the lower and upper limits of @xmath9 correspond to a fully coherent and fully decohered system , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the lower and upper limits of @xmath10 correspond to a memoryless and maximum memory ( degree of correlation ) cases , respectively .",
    "it is shown that for @xmath11 , with decoherence and noise parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , the game reduces to the classical one for all the cases discussed in this paper . in prisoner s dilemma game , when @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath17 , it is interesting to note that though the initial state is entangled , the quantum player has no advantage over the classical player in prisoner s dilemma and chicken games .",
    "the same happens for the case of @xmath18 @xmath19 an interesting aspect of these cases arises based on entangling parameter @xmath20 and measurement parameter @xmath16 for @xmath16 @xmath17 , @xmath21 @xmath15 and @xmath18 @xmath22 in battle of sexes game .",
    "it is seen that the quantum player is better off for both of the above cases for @xmath23 in case of amplitude - damping and depolarizing channels respectively .",
    "for the case when @xmath24 @xmath16 @xmath25 @xmath26 , the quantum player always remains better off for all values of @xmath27 against a player restricted to classical strategies for all the nine cases considered .",
    "several investigations concern the transmission of quantum information from one party ( alice ) to another ( bob ) through a communication channel . in the most basic configuration",
    "the information is encoded in qubits .",
    "if the qubits are perfectly protected from environmental influence , bob receives them in the same state prepared by alice . in the more realistic case , however , the qubits have a nontrivial dynamics during the transmission because of their interaction with the environment [ 25 ] . therefore , bob receives a set of distorted qubits because of the disturbing action of the channel .",
    "recently , the study of quantum channels has attracted a lot of attention [ 18 , 19 , 26 ] .",
    "early works in this direction were devoted , mainly , to memoryless channels for which consecutive signal transmissions through the channel are not correlated . correlated noise , also referred as memory in the literature , acts on consecutive uses of the channels .",
    "however in general one may want to encode classical data into entangled strings or , consecutive uses of the channel may be correlated to each other .",
    "hence , we are dealing with a strongly correlated quantum system , the correlation of which results from the memory of the channel itself . in our model alice and bob ,",
    "each uses individual channels to communicate with the arbiter of the game .",
    "alice s channel is correlated in time ( and therefore has a memory ) , i.e. the two uses of the channel ; the first passage ( from the arbiter ) and the second passage ( back to the arbiter ) through the channel are correlated .",
    "a similar situation occurs for bob as depicted in figure 1 .",
    "we consider here different noise models based on phase - damping , amplitude - damping and depolarizing channels .",
    "the action of transmission channels is described by kraus operators which satisfy @xmath28 in operator sum representation the dephasing process can be expressed as [ 25 ] .",
    "@xmath29where @xmath30 represents the initial density matrix for quantum state and @xmath31are the kraus operators , @xmath32 is the identity operator , @xmath27 is the decoherence parameter and @xmath33 is the pauli matrix .",
    "let @xmath34 qubits are allowed to pass through such a channel then equation ( 1 ) becomes [ 27 ] @xmath35now if the noise is correlated with memory of degree @xmath36 then the action of the channel on two consecutive qubits is given by kraus operator [ 18]@xmath37}\\sigma _ { i}\\otimes \\sigma _ { j}\\]]where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are usual pauli matrices with indices @xmath40 and @xmath41 running from @xmath15 to @xmath42 the above expression means that with the probability @xmath43 the noise is uncorrelated whereas with probability @xmath0 the noise is correlated as illustrated in the below equations . physically the parameter @xmath0 is determined by the relaxation time of the channel when a qubit passes through it . in order to remove correlations",
    ", one can wait until the channel has relaxed to its original state before sending the next qubit , however this lowers the rate of information transfer .",
    "thus it is necessary to consider the performance of the channel for arbitrary values of @xmath0 to reach a compromise between various factors which determine the final rate of information transfer .",
    "thus in passing through the channel any two consecutive qubits undergo random independent ( uncorrelated ) errors with probability @xmath43 and identical ( correlated ) errors with probability @xmath0",
    ". this should be the case if the channel has a memory depending on its relaxation time and if we stream the qubits through it .",
    "a quantum dephasing channel ( pauli @xmath44 channel ) with uncorrelated noise ( memoryless channel ) can be defined as one specified by the following kraus operators @xmath45and one with correlated noise ( channel with memory ) by @xmath46the action of a depolarizing channel with memory can be expressed as@xmath47where @xmath48with probability @xmath43 the noise is uncorrelated and completely specified by the kraus operators @xmath49and one with correlated noise ( channel with memory ) by @xmath50where @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 however , we note that a quantum amplitude - damping channel with uncorrelated noise can be defined as one specified by the following kraus operators : @xmath54@xmath55 , \\ \\ \\ a_{1}=\\left [   \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 0 \\\\   \\sin \\chi & 0% \\end{array}% \\right]\\]]however , the kraus operators for a quantum amplitude - damping channel with correlated noise are given by yeo and skeen [ 19 ] as under :    @xmath56 , \\ \\ \\ a_{11}^{c}=\\left [   \\begin{array}{llll } 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\   \\sin \\chi & 0 & 0 & 0% \\end{array}% \\right]\\ ] ]    where , @xmath57 and is related to decoherence parameter as @xmath58it is clear that @xmath59 can not be written as a tensor product of two two - by - two matrices .",
    "this gives rise to the typical spooky action of the channel : @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and any linear combination of them , and @xmath62 will go through the channel undisturbed , but not @xmath63the action of this non - unital channel is given by @xmath64    the protocol for quantum games in the presence of correlated noise is developed by nawaz and toor [ 22 ] .",
    "we consider that an initial entangled state is prepared by the arbiter and passed on to the players through three prototype quantum correlated channels ( as shown in figure 1 ) .",
    "i.e. alice and bob each uses individual channels to communicate with the arbiter of the game .",
    "alice s channel is correlated in time ( and therefore has a memory ) , i.e. the two uses of the channel are correlated . on receiving the quantum state from the arbiter ,",
    "the players apply their local operators ( strategies ) and return it back to arbiter through qcc .",
    "arbiter then performs the measurement and announces their payoffs .",
    "let the game start with the initial quantum state given below,@xmath65where @xmath66 corresponds to entanglement of the initial state .",
    "the strategies of the players in the generalized quantization scheme are represented by the unitary operator @xmath67 of the form [ 24 ] .",
    "@xmath68where @xmath69 or @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the unitary operators defined as @xmath73where @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xmath76 under the generalized quantization scheme with three parameter strategies , the initial state given in equation ( 15 ) transforms to @xmath77where @xmath78 is the density matrix for the quantum state .",
