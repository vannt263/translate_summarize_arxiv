    "the description of the collision of two black holes , including the total energy radiated and the waveforms to be measured by observers far from the collision region , is at this time one of the most active fields of research in general relativity .",
    "since the latter theory has a well posed initial value problem , a good deal of effort has been devoted to finding solutions for the initial value problem , in the form of initial data sets , that may represent slices of recognizable physical processes involving black holes .",
    "one of the first examples of this kind was given by misner @xcite , who derived an initial data set representing the moment of time symmetry in the head - on collision of two equal mass black holes , placed at an arbitrary distance from each other .",
    "further developments along this line have provided a fair number of interesting initial data sets @xcite , that can be interpreted as representing isolated but boosted and/or rotating black holes , or collisions involving two or more black holes .",
    "once one has the initial data , the next task is to study the evolution and the consequent emission of gravitational waves arising from the collision . due to the complexity of the evolution equations of general relativity , numerical solutions of the full einstein equations",
    "are available at present only for equal mass , nonspinning , holes undergoing a head - on ( i.e. , zero impact parameter ) collision .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that for a restricted set of parameters , the evolution can be well described by treating the system as a perturbation of a single black hole @xcite .",
    "this method , called the `` close approximation , '' has produced results that are in remarkable agreement with the full numerical results in the case where the latter are available .",
    "an appealing feature of the perturbation method is the explicit control over the parameters characterizing the perturbation .",
    "this , together with the development of some form of `` error bars , '' as in @xcite , can make the method an important tool to make predictions of physical processes or to provide comparison cases to test the reliability of numerical methods .",
    "the initial data set that is usually considered @xcite in the study of black hole collisions is generated using the conformal approach , in which one assumes that the spatial metric is conformally flat , and the maximal slicing condition is chosen for the extrinsic curvature . in the flat space , it is relatively simple to construct a conformally related extrinsic curvature which guarantees that the momentum constraint is solved .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is subsequently solved , either numerically @xcite or via approximations @xcite . in this construction there is a series of simplifying assumptions and there is no claim that a `` generic '' solution has been found .",
    "it is therefore not clear that the particular solution generated is a true representation of the physical problem in which one is interested .",
    "an example of this is the bowen and york ( by)@xcite solution for a single spinning hole .",
    "it is known that this initial data set represents a dynamical situation that evolves to a kerr black hole asymptotically in the future .",
    "initially , however , the spacetime is not a kerr spacetime , but can be thought ( somewhat inappropriately ) to differ from a kerr solution in that it has some `` gravitational wave content , '' the waves that will be radiated as the spacetime evolves towards kerr .    one can argue that this `` gravitational wave content '' will be radiated in a short time , and that the initial data will evolve rapidly to a stationary kerr black hole configuration , and therefore will not greatly affect the radiation produced in a black hole collision , as long as the holes are released far from each other .",
    "the question is important enough to deserve a more careful answer .",
    "in addition , numerical relativity codes can not be accurately run for long evolution times , so initial data will have to be specified at fairly late times , with holes fairly close together , and with the possibility that the `` gravitational wave content '' of the initial data is a major part of the outgoing radiation .    the purpose of this paper is to analyze the radiation from the individual holes .",
    "more specifically , we use the theory of perturbations of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we consider that we have a family of spacetimes depending on the parameter @xmath0 , and that , in appropriate coordinate systems , metrics of the family can be expanded as @xmath1 here @xmath2 the schwarzschild metric , @xmath3 is called the first order perturbation , and @xmath4 is called the second order perturbation . to analyze the `` bowen and york spacetime , '' the spacetime that evolves from bowen and york initial data for a single spinning hole , we choose as the expansion parameter the angular momentum @xmath5 , and we analyze both the kerr solution and the by spacetime to second order in @xmath5 .",
    "the second order expansions are then compared and we find that we need only to evolve the difference between the by spacetime and the kerr spacetime .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we give a perturbation analysis of the by initial data .",
    "the method of evolving this initial data is described in section iii . in section",
    "iv the results for radiation emitted are presented and discussed . in an appendix",
    "we show how the kerr metric can be written as an expansion , in angular momentum , about the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "when it is useful to specify orders of expansion , and/or multipole indices , we shall use a leading subscript to denote the multipole index @xmath6 , and a superscript , in parenthesis , to the right of a perturbation variable , to indicate order in @xmath5 .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 , for example , is a monopole perturbation , second order in @xmath5 .",
    "the bowen ",
    "york @xcite construction of initial data assumes that space - time contains a ( constant @xmath8 ) slice , where the 3-metric can be written in the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the metric for the flat background @xmath11 , while the extrinsic curvature is given by @xmath12 , and satisfies @xmath13 . with these assumptions",
    "the initial value constraint equations take the form @xmath14 and @xmath15 where the laplacian , and the covariant differentiation ( denoted by a vertical bar ) are taken with respect to the flat space metric .",
    "the problem is not fully specified until appropriate boundary conditions are imposed on @xmath16 .",

    "however , we are really interested in solutions near @xmath30 ( `` slow rotation '' ) and an expansion in powers of @xmath5 is appropriate .",

    "two other computations of @xmath49 are also plotted , based on the integral @xcite , @xmath50 the solid curve shows the result of substituting @xmath16 , to second order in @xmath5 , into the integrals in eq .",

    "( [ madmbypert ] ) to second order in @xmath5 , but is significantly smaller for large @xmath5 .",
    "( the difference is due to terms higher order in @xmath5 ; the expressions are identical up to second order ) .",
    "the dark points show the result of a multigrid numerical code we wrote to solve the fully nonlinear initial value problem of general relativity with axisymmetry , similar to that used by choptuik and unruh @xcite .",
    "the results presented to this point are formally expansions to second order in the dimensionless parameter @xmath51 , but @xmath17 itself is not a physical parameter , so the physical meaning of this expansion is unclear . for that reason we now convert our result to an expansion in the parameter @xmath52 .",
    "( here , and in subsequent expressions , we drop the `` adm '' subscript on @xmath53 .",
    "the symbol @xmath53 will always represent the adm mass . )",
    "we then consider in the expressions we gave for the conformal factor , @xmath54 that the parameter @xmath17 is really given by @xmath55 .",
    "one can obtain explicit formulas for this by considering the expression for @xmath55 obtained by inverting the approximate expression eq.([madmbypert ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can keep the implicit dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath5 , and can replace it in the last step of a calculation , using tabulated values for @xmath55 obtained from the multigrid numerical code .",
    "in this case the `` second order part '' is the part of @xmath16 that remains after the part zeroth order in @xmath52 is subtracted .    if the relation of @xmath17 and @xmath5 is taken from eq.([madmbypert ] ) , the explicit formulas ( correct to second order ) are , @xmath56 with @xmath57@xmath58@xmath59    to obtain the background metric in the usual schwarzschild form we introduce the radial coordinate @xmath60 with @xmath61 since the conformal factor , up to second order , can be written as @xmath62\\ , \\ ] ] the 3-geometry to second order is given by @xmath63\\ , \\ ] ] and , in terms of the @xmath60 variable , we may write @xmath64",
    "we adopt the notation of regge and wheeler@xcite for the separation into parities and the multipole decomposition of the perturbations . because we are considering axisymmetric situations ,",
    "all multipole decompositions are given in terms of legendre polynomials @xmath65 .",
    "on the initial constant-@xmath8 hypersurface of the by spacetime , we can read off the perturbations of the 3-geometry from eq .",
    "( [ initbypert ] ) .",
    "the perturbations are purely second order even parity , and in the regge - wheeler notation , are : @xmath66    the first order perturbations contained in the by spacetime are those specified by the extrinsic curvature in eq .",
    "( [ byk ] ) , which can be reexpressed as @xmath67 and is identical to the extrinsic curvature given in eq.([kerrk ] ) for the kerr geoemtry .",
    "the explicit form of the metric perturbations , to first order in @xmath5 , depends on the gauge ( first order coordinate fixing ) we choose .",
    "let us choose the coordinates to first order so that the initial by metric is the same as the first order kerr metric given by eq .",
    "( [ appgtphi ] ) of the appendix .",
    "that is , let us choose @xmath68 to be the only nonvanishing first order initial perturbation .",

    "let us choose , therefore , to have the perturbation in eq .",
    "( [ gby1 ] ) be the first order perturbation for all time .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that we are choosing coordinates , to first order in @xmath5 , so that the by and the kerr spacetimes agree , at all times , to first order in @xmath5 .    in principle",
    ", the radiation in the by spacetime would be found from the quadrupolar part of einstein s equations to second order in @xmath52 .",
    "these equations contain terms linear in the @xmath70 second order metric perturbations , and quadratic in the first order perturbations .",
    "the general structure of these equations is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that reference",
    "it is shown how these second order equations can be combined into an equation like that of zerilli@xcite for first order equations .",
    "the second order equivalent of the zerilli equation differs only in that it has `` source '' terms quadratic in the first order perturbations .",
    "since we know the first order perturbations , for all time , for the by spacetime , we know the source term . the wave equation can therefore be solved numerically and the radiation signal found from the solution for the wave variable at large radius .    in practice , this computation can be made much simpler . since the first order perturbations in the by and the kerr spacetimes are identical , the source terms will be identical in the second order einstein equations for by and for kerr .",
    "we can exploit this , by evolving only the difference between the second order by and kerr perturbations , following the technique used by cunningham _",
    "et al._@xcite . to do this",
    ", we take as our second order @xmath70 variable the moncrief@xcite wave variable @xmath71\\over \\partial r}+6 r^2 { \\partial   [ \\,_2g^{(2)}]\\over \\partial } r+2 r   \\,_2h^{(2)}_2 -12 \\,_2h^{(2)}_1\\right ) + 4 r\\ , _ 2k^{(2)}\\ ] ] in which @xmath72 and @xmath73 are second order @xmath70 perturbations .",
    "this moncrief wave variable has two very useful features .",
    "first , @xmath74 is constructed only from perturbations in the 3-geometry on the initial hypersurfaces .",
    "second , it is invariant under second order coordinate transformations , that is , under transformations of form @xmath75 , in which @xmath76 is second order .",
    "we are using here the same normalization for our wave function as in ref .",
    "this normalization is formally the same as that of zerilli@xcite , except that we expand in @xmath77 rather than @xmath78 ; as a result our @xmath79 is related to the variable @xmath80 of zerilli@xcite by @xmath81 . for a discussion of the relationship of the moncrief and zerilli variables , and various normalizations ,",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the analysis to arbitrary @xmath82 .",
    "we use the moncrief wave functions @xmath83 to describe the bowen york spacetime , and @xmath84 for kerr .",
    "the initial value for @xmath85 are taken from eq .",
    "( [ initby ] ) and the value of @xmath84 , initially and for all time , are taken from the expansion in the appendix , from which we have , @xmath86    we now define a `` radiative '' moncrief wave function by @xmath87 since the first order perturbations , and therefore the source terms , for @xmath83 and for @xmath84 are the same , @xmath88 satisfies a homogeneous zerilli function @xmath89 \\over \\partial { r^*}^2 } - { \\partial^2 \\left[_2\\chi^{\\rm rad}(t , r)\\right ] \\over \\partial t^2 } -v(r^*)\\ _ 2\\chi^{\\rm rad}(t , r ) = 0\\ , \\label{zer21}\\ ] ] where @xmath90\\ , \\ ] ] and where @xmath91 is the @xmath70 zerilli potential @xmath92    a word of explanation is appropriate about the properties of @xmath74 under a coordinate transformation .",
    "as already stated , @xmath74 is invariant under a transformation in which the coordinates change only to second order .",
    "this is why we can use eqs .",
    "( [ l=2krr1 ] )  ( [ l=2krr5 ] ) to evaluate @xmath93 , and eq .",
    "( [ initby ] ) for @xmath83 , though the second order metric perturbations used are clearly in different gauges .",
    "the point is that we know that the second order perturbations can be brought into the same second order gauge with second order gauge transformations , and that this has no effect on @xmath94 or on @xmath83 , and hence no effect on @xmath88 .",
    "it should be realized that @xmath74 is _ not _ invariant under a first order change of coordinates . if we were to perform ,",
    "say , a first order change in the coordinates used in the appendix , then the value of @xmath84 we would compute would change .",
    "it is important , therefore , that no first order change in coordinates is needed for the kerr expansion in the appendix , or the by spacetime in sec.[sec : by ] .",
    "they are already in the same first order gauge .",
    "the initial @xmath74 for this equation is simply the known difference between the initial forms of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and turns out to be @xmath95 there are no second order perturbations to the extrinsic curvature of a constant time slice of kerr , or in the by initial data .",
    "the first of these conclusions follows from an explicit computation based on the metric in the appendix .",
    "one finds that the extrinsic curvature contains only odd powers of @xmath5 .",
    "( this conforms to the intuition that suggests that reversing the direction of @xmath5 should reverse the sign of extrinsic curvature . )",
    "the conformally related extrinsic curvature @xmath96 for the by initial data is given to all orders by eq .",
    "( [ byhatk ] ) .",
    "the second order perturbations in the conformal factor mean that the extrinsic curvature @xmath97 will contain perturbations of odd orders in @xmath5 , due to the perturbations of even order contained in @xmath16 .",
    "since there are no second order contributions to the extrinsic curvature , of either by or kerr , it follows that @xmath98    the wave equation of eqs .",
    "( [ zeq ] )  ( [ zpot ] ) , with the cauchy data of eqs .",
    "( [ initrad ] )  ( [ initraddot ] ) , is simply solved numerically for @xmath99 , and from the solution we can find @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the known , time independent , kerr solution .",
    "the radiative power ( see ref.@xcite ) contained in the by spacetime is then given by @xmath102 and this is the gravitational radiation power emitted as the by solution settles into its kerr final form .",
    "the energy radiated is the time integral of this expression .",
    "in fig.[fig : waves ] we show the radiated waveform , as a function of @xmath8 , for fixed , large @xmath60 , from which we may infer the effective time for the decay of the bowen ",
    "york rotating black hole into its final kerr state .",
    "it is clear that the wave form is dominated by quasinormal ringing .",
    "this means that the `` initial burst '' of energy generated as the hole relaxes to kerr form can contaminate the evolution for some time .    in fig.[fig :",
    "radene ] we show the total energy radiated as a function of @xmath52 .",
    "whatever choice we make for the @xmath5 dependence of the adm mass , our perturbation calculation for @xmath103 is formally correct only to second order in @xmath52 . since the radiated energy is quadratic in @xmath103 , the energy results displayed in fig.[fig : radene ] are formally correct only to fourth order in @xmath52 , the lowest nontrivial order .",
    "the results in fig.[fig : radene ] , can not therefore be trusted for @xmath52 near the astrophysically interesting limit @xmath104 .",
    "we suspect that the curve corresponding to the numerical adm mass is reliable within a factor of two or so up to @xmath105 .",
    "a more accurate evaluation will require either fully nonlinear numerical relativity , or a calculation using second order perturbations around the kerr solution .    according to fig.[fig : radene ] , the `` by relaxation energy , '' the energy emitted as a single by hole relaxes to a kerr hole appears to be small .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the total radiation in a black hole coalescence can be comparably small . for a head on collision of nonspinning holes",
    "the total radiated energy is of order @xmath106 of the total adm mass .",
    "head on collisions , of course , are not of primary astrophysical interest . for the `` merger '' phase of equal mass holes ,",
    "radiated energy is expected to be several percent@xcite . in this case , the by relaxation energy would be negligibly small .",
    "it would , furthermore , be emitted within a few quasinormal periods of a single hole , while the merger and ringdown of the final hole formed would require a time an order of magnitude longer .",
    "we were able to write our multigrid code by studying a code of the ncsa / potsdam group . we wish to thank peter anninos for help with this . using the adm mass instead of",
