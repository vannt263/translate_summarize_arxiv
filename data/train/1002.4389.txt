    "we want to see that by perhaps choosing a smaller neighborhood , @xmath218 , of the knots inside of @xmath206 , this flow line does not hit @xmath218 . this must be the case because if no such neighborhood existed , by compactness , this flow line would have to intersect @xmath193 or @xmath194 .",

    "this says , after rescaling the function on the neighborhoods of @xmath85 and @xmath208 back to their original values , the new morse function is self - indexing on @xmath7 with exactly one index 0 and one index 3 critical point , and furthermore , still agrees with @xmath207 when restricted to a small enough neighborhood of the knots .",
