    "the investigation on the electromagnetic ( em ) masses of the low - lying mesons has a long history , however , which is mainly on evaluating the em masses of pseudoscalar @xmath4 and @xmath5-mesons ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite(hereafter referred as paper i ) , we have presented a systematic investigation on the em mass splittings of the low - lying mesons including @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 in the framework of the u(3)@xmath9u(3)@xmath10 chiral theory of mesons @xcite .",
    "the present paper is the continuation of paper i. we are to calculate the em self - energies of the vector @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 mesons to one - loop order and @xmath11 .",
    "chiral quark model is originated by weinberg @xcite , and developed by manohar and georgi @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the vector meson ( @xmath12meson ) is firstly introduced into this model in order to study quark spin contents in chiral soliton model .",
    "the author of ref . @xcite further extended it to include the low - lying 1@xmath13(vector ) and 1@xmath14(axial - vector ) mesons ( called as u(3)@xmath9u(3)@xmath10 chiral theory of mesons ) .",
    "the u(3)@xmath9u(3)@xmath10 chiral theory of mesons has been investigated extensively @xcite and its theoretical results agree well with the data .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , which is expanded in powers of derivatives of the meson fields , is rigorous and phenomenologically successful in describing the physics of the pseudoscalar mesons at very low energies @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , starting from the u(3)@xmath9u(3)@xmath10 chiral theory of mesons , and by using path integral method to integrate out the vector and axial - vector resonances , the authors have derived the chiral coupling constants of chpt ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the experimental values of the @xmath20 at @xmath21 in chpt .",
    "therefore , the qcd constraints discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite are met by this theory .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that vector meson dominance ( vmd)@xcite has been introduced into the u(3)@xmath9u(3)@xmath10 chiral theory of mesons .",
    "this means that the electromagnetic interaction of the mesons has been well established , which makes it possible to evaluate the em self - energies of the low - lying mesons systematically .    in paper",
    "i , the logarithmic divergences coming from meson - loop diagrams which contribute to the em mass splittings of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 mesons have been factorized by using the intrinsic parameter @xmath22 of the theory ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "however , when this method is extended to the cases of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2-mesons , the circumstances will be complicated .",
    "the feynman diagrams contributing to the em self - energies of @xmath0-mesons can be divided into three kinds , which have been shown in fig .",
    "1.1 is tree diagram , and it contributes the finite result ; fig .",
    "1.2 involves only logarithmic divergences , which could be evaluated by using the same method in paper i. in the framework of the u(3)@xmath9u(3)@xmath10 chiral theory of mesons , the explicit one - loop feynman diagrams which belong to fig .",
    "1.2 will be drawn in figs .",
    "8 , 9 , and 10 ; it will meet some difficulties in computing fig .",
    "1.3 because the quadratic or higher order divergences will emerge in the feynman integrations of these loop diagrams .",
    "therefore , it is unsuitable to factorize these divergences by using @xmath22 in which only the logarithmic one is involved .    however ,",
    "if watching these feynman diagrams carefully , one will find that the contribution from fig .",
    "1.3 could be ignored .",
    "considering one - loop correction to the @xmath23 vertex ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and comparing fig . 1.3 with fig .",
    "2 , one will see that the contribution of fig . 1.3 to em self - energies of @xmath0-mesons",
    "should vanish if the one - loop renormalized @xmath23 vertex is used in fig .",
    "the expressions of vmd in the u(3)@xmath9u(3)@xmath10 chiral theory of mesons have been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be read as @xmath24 where @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the corresponding hadronic currents for @xmath29 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 mesons respectively .    by employing the @xmath23 vertex in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the decay width of @xmath30 is @xmath31 here @xmath32 . when @xmath22=0.39,=0.39 instead of @xmath22=0.35 , we will get much better fit for the data than that in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath22=0.39 has been set in paper i and refs . @xcite . ]",
    "the numerical result of @xmath33 is 6.53 kev , which is in good agreement with the experimental data 6.77@xmath340.32 kev @xcite .",
    "it is expected that one - loop corrections to the @xmath23 vertex are very small , and can be ignored .",
    "it is enough to evaluate the contributions from fig .",
    "1.1 and 1.2 to em self - energies of @xmath0-mesons .",
    "the effect of fig .",
    "1.3 is included by renormalizing the @xmath23 vertex .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "1.3 is not the 1pi ( one particle irreducible ) diagram for the one - loop em self - energies of @xmath0-meson .",
    "thus , it is straightforward to use the method developed in paper i to factorize the logarithmic divergences from mesonic loop diagrams , then to get a finite result of @xmath3 em mass difference .",
    "the difficulties in calculating the em self - energies of @xmath1 and @xmath2-mesons can be circumvented similarly .",
    "it has been pointed out by sakurai @xcite that there are two ways of writing down vmd . in eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) ( called as vmd1 ) ,",
    "the photon - meson coupling have two approaches : the first one is the direct coupling of photon and mesons ( @xmath35 , @xmath36=@xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ) , the second one is the interaction through the neutral vector mesons including @xmath29 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .    the other representation of vmd ( called as vmd2 ) , in which the photon - mesons coupling must be through the neutral vector mesons , is expressed as follows @xmath37    as proved by kroll , lee , and zumino @xcite , and by sakurai @xcite , vmd1 and vmd2 are equivalent in describing the electromagnetic interaction of the mesons .",
    "fortunately , in the framework of the u(3)@xmath9u(3)@xmath10 chiral theory of mesons and employing vmd2 , the loop diagram ( fig .",
    "1.3 ) contributing to the em self - energies of the vector mesons which contains quadratic or higher order divergences will disappear automatically , and only the logarithmic divergence is involved in the rest loop diagrams .",
    "our calculations show that , without considering fig .",
    "1.3 , contributions to em self - energies of @xmath0-mesons by using vmd1 are entirely equivalent to ones by using vmd2 directly .    the purposes of the present paper are twofold :    1 .",
    "the investigation of em self - energies of the vector mesons has been concerned by particle physicists . here , we are to extend the method used in paper i to calculate the one - loop em self - energies of the low - lying mesons in the case of vector mesons including @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2-mesons , which makes the investigation in paper i much more complete and systematic .    2 .  an interesting effect",
    ", em masses anomaly of the massive yang - mills particles , has been revealed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which states that the non - abelian gauge structure of the massive yang - mills particles makes the em mass of the neutral @xmath8(892 ) larger than that of the charged one .",
    "this claim will be re - examined in the cases of @xmath0 meson and other massive yang - mills particles elaborately .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , the equivalence of vmd1 and vmd2 is discussed briefly . as examples , we show that , in the framework of the u(3)@xmath9u(3)@xmath10 chiral theory of mesons , vmd1 and vmd2 could reduce the same results of the pion em form factor and the em mass splitting of @xmath38 , and the well - known result of @xmath39 obtained by das , guralnik , mathur , low , and young @xcite is reproduced .",
    "3 , the em self - energies of the vector mesons including @xmath0 , @xmath1,and @xmath2 are evaluated , and the em mass anomaly of the massive yang - mills particles is discussed .",
    "4 , we give the summary of the results .",
    "vmd predates the standard model .",
    "it has not been derived from the standard model directly , but nevertheless enjoys phenomenological supports in describing hadronic electromagnetic interactions . in the u(3)@xmath9u(3)@xmath10 chiral theory of mesons ,",
    "the basic lagrangian of the theory is ( hereafter we use the notations in paper i ) @xmath40 where @xmath41$](@xmath36=1,2,3 and @xmath42=4,5,6,7 ) , @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the photon field , @xmath45 is the electric charge operator of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 quarks , @xmath49 is quark - fields , @xmath50 is a parameter related to the quark condensate , and @xmath51 is the kinetic lagrangian of photon field .",
    "thus , the use of path integral method to integrate out the quark fields will reduce the effective lagrangian of the mesons .    since the photon field @xmath44 has been introduced into eq .",
    "( 9 ) , it is very natural to deduce the explicit expressions of vmd in the mesonic effective lagrangian , which are just the eqs.(1)-(3 ) .",
    "the full lagrangian which describes the interaction of photon and the neutral vector mesons could be expressed as follows , @xmath52 for simplicity , here we only discuss the interactions between @xmath29 and the photon .",
    "vmd1 is manifestly gauge invariant for the neutral vector meson @xmath29 coupling with the conserved current in strong interaction .",
    "as pointed out by sakurai @xcite , there is an equivalent way of writing down a gauge invariant expression for hadronic electromagnetic interaction , which is @xmath53 from vmd1 to vmd2 , one can use the following transformation , @xmath54 it seems that the mass term of the photon field in eq .",
    "( 11 ) violates gauge invariance of the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "however , the @xmath55 term in this equation contributes an imaginary mass term of the photon , which exactly cancels the contribution from mass term of the photon . to illustrate this",
    ", one could calculate the modification of the photon propagator using the new interaction lagrangian including the new mass term of the photon ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    from fig .",
    "3 , one will obtain @xmath56 using the operator identity @xmath57 we have @xmath58 for small @xmath59 .",
    "thus , we are simply left with a change in em coupling constant @xmath60 @xmath61    in the following , as an example , we show the equivalence of vmd1 and vmd2 by calculating pion em form factor . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the interaction @xmath62 has been derived @xmath63\\epsilon_{ijk}\\rho_\\mu^i\\partial_\\nu\\pi^j\\partial^\\mu\\partial^\\nu\\pi^k,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the decay constant of pion with value @xmath66 gev .",
    "thus , the pion em form factor @xmath67 can be defined through the amplitude of process @xmath68 @xmath69 here @xmath70 and @xmath71 are momentum of pion and the virtual photon respectively . from vmd1 ( as shown in fig .",
    "4.1 ) , we have @xmath72 where @xmath73\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the second term in eq . ( 16 ) due to the direct interaction of @xmath0 and @xmath74 vanishes at @xmath75 , and it is therefore very important to take into account the effect of the contact @xmath76 interaction .    from vmd2 ( as shown in fig .",
    "4.2 ) , one obtains @xmath77 it is obvious that the two approaches lead to the identical result from eq .",
    "( 16 ) and eq .",
    "( 17 ) .",
    "now , we show that vmd1 and vmd2 are equivalent in evaluating the em mass splitting of pions . in paper",
    "i , the em mass difference between @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the chiral limit has been obtained in terms of vmd1 . here",
    "we will re - examine this calculation by employing vmd2 .",
    "the feynman diagrams contributing to @xmath80 have been shown in fig . 5 and fig . 6 , which correspond to ones from vmd1 and vmd2 respectively (",
    "the diagrams which receive contributions from the interaction @xmath62 have been neglected because their contributions vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "this point has been demonstrated in paper i ) . since there are no the direct vertices of @xmath4 and @xmath74 , the number of the feynman diagrams contributing to em self - energies of pions in terms of vmd2 has been much more decreased .",
    "comparing fig .",
    "5 and fig . 6",
    ", one will find that if the effective propagators in fig . 7.1 and fig .",
    "7.2 are equivalent , the contributions of fig",
    ". 5 and fig . 6 must be the same to the em self - energies of pion - mesons .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "7.1 , the @xmath23 vertex comes from vmd1 , which is momentum dependent ; in fig .",
    "7.2 , the @xmath23 vertex is from vmd2 .",
    "it is easy to prove that fig .",
    "7.1 and fig .",
    "7.2 both contribute @xmath81,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the gauge parameter . because there is always a factor @xmath82 in the coupling of the photon with the current @xmath26 in vmd1 ,",
    "this factor has been considered in calculating fig .",
    "( 18 ) has been obtained by lee and nieh in ref .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the result of em self - energies of pions in terms of vmd1 is the same as one in terms of vmd2 .    the straightforward calculation of fig .",

    "( 34 ) in paper i , the calculations on em - masses are up to the fourth order covariant derivatives in effective lagrangians @xcite . in the remainder of this section , we find that the well - known result of @xmath84 given by das et al @xcite can be reproduced if the em self - energies of pions receives the contributions only from the second order derivative terms . in this case , the interaction lagrangians @xmath85 and @xmath86 [ eqs.(18)(19 ) in paper i ] will be simplified as follows @xmath87 thus , in the chiral limit",
    ", the em mass difference of pions is @xmath88 the feynman integration in eq.(20 ) is finite .",
    "so it is straightforward to get the result of @xmath89 after performing this integration , which is @xmath90 because we only consider the second order derivative terms in the lagrangian , the relation between @xmath91 and @xmath92 is @xmath93 instead of eq.(4 ) in paper i. thus , we can get @xmath94 when substituting the relation @xmath95 , which can be derived from the weinberg sum rules @xcite , into eq.(21 ) , we have @xmath96 which is exactly the result obtained by das et al .",
