    "the experimental observation of the rydberg blockade in thermal and condensed samples @xcite as well as the exploitation of the blockade for quantum logical operations @xcite mark the most important breakthroughs .",
    "these new developments complement previous studies on cold plasmas and spectroscopy of rydberg states and are accompanied by exciting proposals for quantum information and quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "most experiments are realized with rubidium atoms where a convenient excitation scheme exists using a two photon transition via the intermediate @xmath2 state .",
    "the first excitation step at 780 nm can be made with a standard diode laser while the second step @xmath3 nm can only be realized using second harmonic generation ( shg ) .",
    "an amplified diode laser system ( mopa ) with subsequent frequency doubling in a resonator is a frequently used configuration which can be homemade or purchased commercially . in this configuration ,",
    "the power of the blue light can exceed 200 mw @xcite .",
    "the bandwidth of the frequency doubled light is determined by that of the fundamental frequency and typically amounts to a few mhz .",
    "the approach is cost intensive , and the handling of shg in a resonator can be involved .",
    "less sophisticated and more cost efficient ways of frequency doubling can therefore be an interesting alternative , especially if only low power at the fundamental frequency is available .",
    "periodically poled crystals can double the frequency in a single pass .",
    "guiding the fundamental light field in a waveguide provides high intensity , while the periodic poling provides the condition of quasi phase matching .",
    "highly efficient single pass frequency doubling using periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) waveguide crystal at 488 nm has been previously reported @xcite .",
    "coupling light from a dfb laser ( total output power 400mw ) in the waveguide ( 300mw coupled power ) , a converted power of 160mw could be generated , corresponding to a conversion factor of @xmath4 .",
    "as shown recently @xcite , this approach is also suitable for narrow linewidth shg in the khz regime .    here",
    ", we report on frequency doubling of a seeded diode laser with an output power of 300mw and a wavelength of 990 nm .",
    "we achieve up to 35mw power at 495 nm .",
    "the single - frequency operation of the laser system is verified via eit spectroscopy of the @xmath5 two photon transition of @xmath6rb , thus directly proving its applicability for the excitation of rydberg states .",

    "the atoms are prepared in a co@xmath8 optical dipole trap . when excited to the 14@xmath9 state ,",
    "the atoms have a high probability to be photoionized by the co@xmath8 laser @xcite .",
    "this helps to increase the overall detection efficiency of this technique .",
    "details of the ionization scheme can be found in @xcite .",
    "the laser system for the fundamental light at 990.6 nm wavelength is a master - slave setup , consisting of two identical high - power laser diodes , with a nominal output power of 400mw and a gain bandwidth from 985 nm to 995 nm .",
    "both diodes are temperature controlled , and collimated by aspheric lenses .",
    "the wavelength selection of the master laser is accomplished by means of optical feedback from a diffraction grating in an external cavity setup in littman configuration @xcite .",
    "this provides the advantage of beam pointing stability during wavelength changes , which is crucial for the following injection - locking @xcite . as a consequence , in our setup",
    "only 16% of the free running power remain after transmission through a 60 db faraday isolator .",
    "single - mode operation over the whole gain bandwidth is possible .",

    "frequency scans of @xmath10ghz are supported by the injection lock .",
    "a reduction of the injection power to @xmath11mw , while maintaining the maximum slave power is possible , though the frequency locking range decreases .",
    "the inspection of single - mode operation is accomplished via spectral analysis of a small fraction of the beam using a fabry prot interferometer ( fpi ) and a photo diode .",
    "after beam shaping optics to compensate for the strongly elliptical profile of the diode and adjustment of the spot size , the infrared light is coupled into the frequency doubling setup .",
    "the polarization of the laser is matched to the crystal axis via a half - wave plate prior to the shg unit , where infrared powers of 300mw are available for conversion .",
    "the frequency conversion assembly consists of two aspheric lenses for the coupling of the incident fundamental ( @xmath12 mm , @xmath13 ) and collimation of the emitted harmonic light ( @xmath14 mm , @xmath15 ) , and a temperature controlled mounting for the waveguide crystal .",
    "the latter provides a temperature stability of @xmath16 k. lenses and crystal can be positioned relative to each other by two three - axis translation stages .",
    "the blue beam is separated from the non - converted transmitted fundamental light through an edge filter .",
    "we use as nonlinear medium a periodically poled magnesium oxide doped lithium niobate waveguide crystal ( hcphotonics ) .",
    "it has outer dimensions of @xmath17mm@xmath18 and is designed for the shg of infrared light in the range of @xmath19 nm at quasi phase matching temperatures between 100@xmath20c and 170@xmath20c with a normalized conversion efficiency @xmath21%w@xmath22@xmath23 .",

    "is guaranteed by the manufacturer , there is always a small amount of conversion in every channel .",
    "hence , the working channel can be easily identified by horizontal translation of the crystal in the focal plane of the focussing lens and counting of the waveguides .    in order to measure the coupling efficiency into the waveguide",
    ", the crystal temperature is detuned far from the optimal phase matching temperature , so that attenuation of the infrared light by shg can be neglected .",

    "this drift is caused by slow thermal expansion of the crystal oven and can be compensated for .",
    "however , the achieved normalized conversion efficiency is distinctly lower than in the specifications , and looking at the long - term performance of the crystal , we found a degradation of the waveguide channel .",
    "after several months , the conversion efficiency has dropped by more than 50% .",
    "an inspection of the crystal front facet with an optical microscope reveals an accumulation of dust particles in the vicinity of the waveguide channels ( dark spots in fig .",

    "the wavelength of @xmath35 nm corresponds to the @xmath39 transition in @xmath6rb which can be calculated by quantum defect theory @xcite .",
    "the experimental confirmation of the wavelength is performed by a two photon spectroscopy , based on electromagnetically induced transparency , involving the transition in question .",
    "moreover the width of the eit signal allows an estimate for the laser linewidth .",
    "the concept of eit is widely studied @xcite and can be understood as an interference of the excitation pathways of atomic states , whose coherence is induced by the laser fields .",
    "it manifests as an absence of absorption of an atomic probe resonance , due to the presence of a coupling light field and has already been demonstrated in the ladder excitation scheme of rubidium for lower and higher principle quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "the probe beam laser system consists of two self constructed grating stabilized diode lasers in littrow configuration  @xcite with a wavelength of 780 nm .",
    "the frequency of a first reference laser is fixed to the atomic @xmath40-crossover peak of the @xmath41 resonance in @xmath6rb by a doppler - free fm - spectroscopy  @xcite in a vapor cell .",
    "beating with a second reference laser to establish an offset lock enables us to shift the frequency of the reference laser 2 up to 1.5ghz with respect to the atomic transition .",
    "hence , the system provides a tunable probe laser beam for the eit - spectroscopy and is aligned with the blue coupling beam in counter propagating direction through a rubidium vapor cell at room temperature ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : laser_setup ] ) .",
    "the absorption signal of the probe beam is detected via a photo diode behind a dichroic mirror , which is transmissive for 780 nm .",

    "the lifetime @xmath552275 ns of the rydberg state @xcite is composed of the decay into the intermediate state and the decay to the ground state via levels , not participating in this excitation scheme .",
