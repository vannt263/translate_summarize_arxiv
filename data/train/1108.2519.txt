    "there is growing interest in using ( d , p ) reactions as a tool to extract single particle properties of nuclei away from stability . since the early studies on @xmath0be @xcite",
    ", an increasing number of transfer experiments have been performed to obtain detailed structure information .",
    "this includes experiments at isol facilities , performed around the coulomb barrier , such as the recent one on @xmath11sn @xcite , but also measurements at higher energy in fragmentation facilities , such as the recent systematics on ar isotopes @xcite . since the information extracted from these experiments relies on reaction models , it is critical to validate these models and assess their uncertainties",
    ".    there are a number of aspects that need to be considered when validating reaction theories . at present",
    ", reaction theories for ( d , p ) , applicable to nuclei with mass @xmath12 , require a reduction of the many - body problem to a few - body problem .",
    "a consequence of this first point is the introduction of effective interactions between the composite constituents , the so called optical potentials and single particle binding potential .",
    "these are the physical inputs to the problem .",
    "in addition , there are often approximations in solving the few - body problem .",
    "it is this last aspect that is the focus of the present work .    for forty years",
    ", the tradition has been to use the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) to extract spectroscopic information from ( d , p ) or ( p , d ) reactions @xcite . even though still in use , this method has been challenged repeatedly .",
    "just in the last decade , a variety of reaction theory studies have been carried out . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the choice of the deuteron optical potential in dwba introduces a very large ambiguity which can be significantly reduced when using the zero - range adiabatic wave approximation developed by johnson and soper(zr - adwa ) @xcite built on the nucleon - target optical potentials . in zr - adwa deuteron breakup is taken into account to all orders , while making a zero - range approximation for the deuteron .",
    "the formalism for a finite range version of the adiabatic wave method ( fr - adwa ) was developed in @xcite , which is also built on nucleon optical potentials .",
    "perhaps even larger than the uncertainties in optical potentials , the ambiguity introduced by the single particle potentials which describes the many - body overlap function has also been a focus of study @xcite .",
    "target excitation is known to be relevant for specific cases and should be considered case by case @xcite .    to add to the long list of reaction theories ,",
    "one should still consider the continuum discretized coupled channel method ( cdcc ) @xcite and the faddeev - type method for transition operators , usually referred to as the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) method @xcite .",
    "although the cdcc method is probably most widely used to describe breakup ( e.g. @xcite ) , the cdcc wavefunction has also been used in the context of ( d , p ) reactions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ags method including the coulomb interaction , originally developed for describing few - nucleon reactions @xcite , has recently been extended to handle ( d , p ) and ( p , d ) nuclear reactions @xcite . the cdcc method takes breakup effects into account to all orders without making any further approximations ( in some ways , adwa is an approximate version of cdcc ) , but faddeev goes a step further in that transfer channels are also included explicitly in the expansion .",
    "the faddeev calculations represent thus the exact solution to the full three body problem when rearrangement channels are present .",
    "while both cdcc and ags make less approximations compared to dwba and adwa , they are computationally demanding .",
    "moreover , their technical implementations are limited , for example , the present treatment of coulomb in the ags method has been successfully applied only to nuclei with charge @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "finally , and most importantly , these two methods are based on a more complex expansion of the wavefunction , in such a way that the final cross section depends not only on the many - body overlap of interest , but on non - trivial interferences between many overlap functions including overlaps with states in the continuum . as a consequence , simpler approximate methods are often preferred by experimentalists .",
    "recently , a systematic study @xcite using the finite range version of the adiabatic wave approximation ( fr - adwa ) @xcite found large finite range effects in ( d , p ) reactions , specially at the higher energies .",
    "the transfer cross section in fr - adwa depends on the overlap function of interest , and not on a complicated superposition of terms with many overlap functions . also important , the method is not computationally expensive and is of practical use for the non expert .",
    "nevertheless , one needs to appreciate that fr - adwa relies on a sturmian expansion which is truncated to first order ( first order should not be confused with dwba , since the adiabatic method relies on an entirely different expansion ) .",
    "this first order truncation of the exact solution of the three - body problem has never been systematically tested before .",
    "fr - adwa calculations in @xcite are used to analyze @xmath14ar(p , d ) data at @xmath15 mev / u and compared to faddeev to determine the error in the treatment of the reaction dynamics .",
    "discrepancies between fr - adwa were found to vary considerably ( 6 - 19% ) .",
    "the work in @xcite calls for a better understanding of the range of validity of fr - adwa .",
    "the aim of the present work is exactly to determine the range of validity of adwa ( we drop fr from now on , since all adwa calculations presented here are finite range ) . in order to do that",
    ", a systematic comparison between adwa and faddeev is performed .",
    "we cover a wide range of beam energies , light and intermediate mass nuclei , well bound and loosely bound systems .",
    "we choose energies for which there is data to ensure that the reaction theory performs sensibly , although our focus is on comparing two theories starting from the same three - body hamiltonian , and not dwell on detailed comparisons with data . in section",
    "ii , we provide some key aspects of adwa and faddeev , in section iii results are presented and discussed . finally in section iv conclusions are drawn .",
    "the starting point for both adwa and faddeev is the three - body hamiltonian for @xmath16 : @xmath17 the interactions between the nucleons and the composite target @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) should contain an imaginary term representing the absorption or transfer to other channels not explicitly included .",
    "we will focus the discussion on the reaction a(d , p)b to the ground state ( g.s . ) of @xmath21 ( note that the formalism for ( p , d ) in prior form is identical to that for ( d , p ) in post form presented here @xcite ) .    following the work on the zero - range adwa @xcite , johnson and tandy @xcite introduced a full finite range version considering the square - integrable sturmian expansion .",
    "the sturmian basis is complete within the range of the interaction , and is defined through : @xmath22 for each given state corresponding to the number of nodes @xmath23 .",
    "the inner product between sturmian states is defined by @xmath24 , and at large distances , all basis states decay exponentially according to the deuteron binding energy .",
    "the three - body wavefunction is now expanded in terms of @xmath25 : @xmath26 this form for the three - body wavefunction is then introduced in the three - body schrdinger equation for scattering @xmath27 which , when imposing the appropriate boundary conditions , allows one to calculate @xmath28 .",
    "this procedure leads to a non - trivial coupled channel equation @xcite which could be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "simplicity is recovered when considering only the first term in the expansion eq.([wf3b ] ) .",
    "@xmath29 then the coupled - channel equation reduces to an optical model type equation with distorting potential @xmath30 where , apart from a normalization factor , @xmath31 is the ground state wavefunction of the deuteron .",
    "the three - body wavefunction eq.([wf3bad ] ) is now inserted in the post - form t - matrix for the ( d , p ) process @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the outgoing proton wave , distorted by @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the wavefunction of the final bound state , generated by a binding potential @xmath36 , and the remnant term is @xmath37 .",
    "even if we were not truncating the sturmian basis , one would expect the method to be at its best when remnant contributions are small , because then the resulting cross section is only sensitive to short distances between the neutron and proton , where the basis is complete .",
    "however , it is not clear that this condition is sufficient when the additional simplification eq.([wf3bad ] ) is introduced .    as opposed to adwa , in the faddeev approach , elastic scattering , transfer , and breakup channels",
    "are treated on equal footing .",
    "therefore , it represents the exact solution to the problem once a three - body hamiltonian eq.([h3b ] ) is defined . in the faddeev method , the wavefunction is expanded in an over - complete basis , involving all three jacobi coordinates @xcite . in the ags method @xcite ,",
    "one starts from the faddeev formalism and arrives at coupled integral equations for the transition operators @xmath38 whose on - shell matrix elements @xmath39 are scattering amplitudes and therefore lead directly to the observables . in eq.([eq : ags ] ) @xmath40 is the free resolvent , @xmath41 being the available three - particle energy in the center of mass ( c.m . ) system and @xmath42 the free hamiltonian .",
    "the two - particle transition matrix is a solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the potential for the pair @xmath45 ; we use the odd - man - out notation .",
    "the channel states @xmath46 for @xmath47 are the eigenstates of the corresponding channel hamiltonian @xmath48 with the energy eigenvalue @xmath41 ; thus , @xmath46 is a product of the bound state wave function for pair @xmath45 and a plane wave with fixed on - shell momentum corresponding to the relative motion of particle @xmath45 and pair @xmath45 in the initial or final state .",
    "the coulomb interaction is an additional complication in the ags method ; nevertheless , when only two particles are charged and charge numbers @xmath49 are not too large , the coulomb interaction has been successfully included @xcite using the method of screening and renormalization @xcite .",
    "we solve the ags equations in the momentum - space partial - wave framework @xcite .",
    "the coulomb screening radius needed for the convergence of the results increases with @xmath49 thereby increasing also the number of partial waves that have to be included .",
    "such calculations are not only time consuming but for very high angular momenta the partial - wave expansion may even become unstable .",
    "this limits the application of the technique with respect to @xmath49 ; so far no calculations have been performed beyond @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "another limitation of the method comes from the pade summation technique for solving the ags integral equation iteratively @xcite ; usually it is hard to achieve convergence for heavier nuclei at low energies . for more details on the numerical techniques we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we perform faddeev ags and finite range adwa calculations for a number of cases that have been repeatedly studied : @xmath0be(p , d)@xmath1be(g.s ) ; @xmath3c(d , p)@xmath4c(g.s ) and @xmath6ca(d , p)@xmath7ca(g.s . ) .",
    "since we are interested in establishing the range of validity of adwa , we explore these at several beam energies . for nearly all cases we choose beam energies for which data is available and we make sure that the present theories are able to provide a fair description of the angular distributions .",
    "however , since in this work we are concerned with testing adwa against the exact faddeev ags theory , we do not include data in the plots .",
    "one of the main inputs to these calculations are the pair interactions . in both calculations ,",
    "a realistic nn interaction is used . since the adwa is performed in coordinate space , and a local form of the nn interaction with ls coupling is needed , the reid interaction @xcite is used .",
    "the more recent momentum based cdbonn @xcite is straightforward to use in ags calculations , contrary to potentials in coordinate space .",
    "these two nn interactions reproduce the low - energy nn phase shifts , the deuteron binding energy , and the quadrupole moment .",
    "in fact , apart from the short distances , the deuteron densities produced with reid and cdbonn are identical , this being true also for the 3n and 4n systems .",
    "we have verified that the use of different nn interactions does not induce differences in the predicted ( d , p ) calculations by repeating both fadd and adwa calculations with a simple gaussian interaction , that reproduces low - energy phase shifts and the deuteron binding energy .",
    "we concluded that the transfer cross sections are not sensitive to the details of this interaction but the consistency between the @xmath51 used to obtain the deuteron wavefunction and the interaction in the transfer operator ( eq.[tad - eq ] ) . this same conclusion was found in previous works @xcite .",
    "for the nucleon optical potentials we use the global parameterization ch89 @xcite . as all global optical potentials ,",
    "the parameters of ch89 are functions of the beam energy . in adwa , when determining @xmath52 in eq.([tad - eq ] ) , half the deuteron energy is used for @xmath20 and @xmath19 , whereas the exit proton energy is used for the auxiliary potential @xmath53 ( for calculating @xmath54 and the remnant contribution ) .",
    "the same @xmath19 used for @xmath52 is used in the transfer operator .",
    "a real interaction @xmath36 is used to calculate the bound state @xmath35 : it consists of a woods - saxon plus spin orbit form with the woods - saxon depth adjusted to reproduce the experimental binding energy of the nucleus under study . in all cases",
    "we fix the geometry of the woods - saxon , the radius @xmath55 fm and diffuseness @xmath56 fm , as well as the spin orbit parameters @xmath57 mev , @xmath58 fm , @xmath59 fm .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , since the neutron interaction is different in the incoming and outgoing channel , two different three - body hamiltonians are used in adwa .    in the faddeev calculation ,",
    "energy dependence in the interactions can introduce orthogonality errors .",
    "it is thus important to make a wise choice for the energy at which @xmath19 is to be calculated .",
    "our standard choice is to fix @xmath19 at the energy in the proton channel ( fadd ) , however we will also show results using half the deuteron energy ( fadd2 ) . concerning the neutron - target interaction , for the partial wave where a bound state exists",
    ", the same @xmath36 interaction is used as for adwa . for all other partial waves ,",
    "the neutron interaction is @xmath20 , taken from ch89 at half the deuteron energy @xcite . in our standard faddeev calculation ( fadd ) , there are two subtle differences in the interactions as compared to adwa : i ) @xmath19 for the deuteron channel is obtained at the proton energy , and ii ) for the partial waves where a neutron bound state exists , the neutron scattering potential @xmath20 has no absorption . because we have seen a larger dependence on the transfer cross sections to @xmath19 than to @xmath20 in previous calculations ( see e.g. fig.10 of @xcite ) , we believe the uncertainty due to i ) dominates the overall uncertainty .",
    "+   +   +     +   +   +    in fig.[fig - be11 ] we present the angular distribution for @xmath0be(p , d)@xmath1be , at @xmath60 mev , @xmath61 mev , and @xmath62 mev .",
    "the blue lines are the results obtained with adwa and the red curves are those with faddeev . in order to understand the subtle difference in the interactions included in the faddeev calculations compared to adwa",
    ", we perform two test calculations : i ) a faddeev calculation using the proton optical potential calculated at half the deuteron energy ( red open circles labeled fadd2 ) and ii ) an adwa calculation where the initial proton distorted wave is calculated with an optical potential determined at half the deuteron energy ( purple filled squares labeled adwa2 ) . the comparison between fadd and fadd2 provides an estimate of the sensitivity to the choice of energy at which the proton - target optical potential is evaluated .",
    "if the two methods were exact , the comparison between fadd2 and adwa2 would provide an estimate of the effect of replacing , in the calculation of @xmath52 , the appropriate neutron optical potential by a real bound state potential in the partial wave where a bound state exists .",
    "of course adwa2 is not exact , and therefore the comparison of fadd2 and adwa2 contains both the difference due to the neutron optical potential ( which should be small ) but also a genuine difference between the treatment of the three - body dynamics . note that if @xmath52 were exact , the t - matrix of eq.([tad - eq ] ) should provide cross sections independent of the auxiliary potential @xmath53 ( used in @xmath54 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "this was recently demonstrated within cdcc @xcite .",
    "therefore , differences between adwa and adwa2 indicate inaccuracies in adwa .",
    "first of all , there are differences between faddeev and adwa cross sections at the lower and higher energy . at @xmath64",
    "mev the agreement is perfect . comparing fadd with fadd2 , we find that only at the higher energy is there a dependence in the choice of energy at which the proton interaction is calculated , and then faddeev calculations using the proton interaction at half the deuteron energy become slightly closer to the corresponding adwa results ( compare fadd2 and adwa2 ) . at @xmath65 mev , adwa and adwa2 differ by @xmath66% at the peak , which indicates that the truncation to the first term in adwa is insufficient at these energies .    in fig.[fig - c12 ]",
    "the same observable is shown for @xmath3c(d , p)@xmath4c at @xmath67 mev , @xmath68 mev and @xmath69 mev .",
    "differences between the faddeev and adwa are smallest at @xmath70 mev . as for @xmath0be ,",
    "only at the highest beam energy are the results sensitive to the choice of energy at which the proton optical potential is defined . in this case , calculating the final proton distorted wave with @xmath53 evaluated at half the deuteron energy slightly improves the agreement ( compare adwa2 versus fadd2 ) .",
    "this is not to say that adiabatic calculations for ( d , p ) should be performed using @xmath53 at half the deuteron energy .",
    "the standard adwa makes the correct choices . here",
    "adwa2 only helps to understand which part of the disagreement with faddeev comes from the slight differences in the proton interaction .",
    "our last case @xmath6ca(d , p)@xmath7ca is shown in fig.[fig - ca48 ] .",
    "angular distributions were calculated at @xmath71 mev , @xmath69 mev and @xmath72 mev .",
    "the comparison between adwa and faddeev follows the same trend as in the previous cases : good agreement at around 10 mev / u , with large deterioration at very high energies .",
    "it was not possible to obtain faddeev solutions for energies lower that @xmath73 mev due to lack of convergence of the pade summation technique .",
    "oddly , for the reactions at @xmath74 mev , while adwa showed a very strong dependence on the choice of @xmath53 , the faddeev results only exhibit a dependence on the proton optical potential around the second peak . at 100 mev ,",
    "the angular distribution is extremely sensitive to the choice of the proton energy used to determine the proton optical potential parameters for both adwa and fadd .",
    "this introduces large ambiguity in the comparison of adwa and faddeev , at 100 mev .",
    "overall , we find the differences between adwa and faddeev to be below 10 % except for the lowest and highest energies .",
    "our results suggest that there is an optimum beam energy ( around 10 - 20 mev / u ) where adwa is at its best , differing from faddeev by only a few percent .",
    "apart from the 100 mev @xmath6ca(d , p ) , changes introduced in the shape of the angular distributions by the adiabatic approximation are small . a quantitative summary of our results , plus additional detail in our calculations ,",
    "is given in table [ errors ] . here",

    "the choice of the energy at which the proton interaction is determined , we also show @xmath77 , the percentage difference between faddeev using the energy in the proton channel to determine @xmath19 ( fadd ) and that using half the deuteron energy ( fadd2 ) .",
    "this represents the ambiguity in the three - body hamiltonian for the faddeev calculations , and can be used as an uncertainty in the comparison .",
    "it is not important for low and intermediate beam energies , and therefore in this beam - energy region , the agreement between faddeev and adwa is robust . for completeness , the identical quantity for adwa @xmath78 is also shown ( where the standard adwa is compared with that where the proton distorted wave is calculated with ch89 using half the deuteron energy adwa2 ) . as the exact t - matrix should be independent on the choice of the auxiliary potential",
    ", @xmath78 provides an internal warning sign that the approximation in adwa is not adequate .",
    "consistent with the comparison with faddeev , the effect becomes significant for the higher beam energies .    in section",
    "ii , we pointed out that the sturmian expansion is expected to be good in the region of @xmath51 but not for large neutron - proton distances .",
    "for this reason , we do not expect adwa to work when the contribution of the remnant term in eq.([tad - eq ] ) is large .",
    "the last column of table ii contains the percentage difference between the original adwa and the adwa calculation neglecting the remnant term , relative to the original adwa .",
    "the only case for which the remnant contribution is large is for the high energy reaction with @xmath0be and then , indeed , adwa performs poorly in comparison with faddeev .",
    "however in the other cases , it is not the remnant contribution that is responsible for the disagreement adwa versus faddeev .",
    "since the largest disagreement comes at the highest beam energies , this suggests that the main source for the adwa disagreement with faddeev comes from the truncation of the sturmian expansion eq.([sturm ] ) .",
    "eq.([wf3bad ] ) implies that all @xmath79 behave as the elastic @xmath80 .",
    "however , at higher beam energies , large excitation energies in the deuteron channel are expected to affect the shape of the adiabatic distorted waves @xmath79 .",

    "figure [ fig - ratio ] provides a good illustration of the validity of adwa for intermediate energies . for the lowest energies , differences increase up to @xmath86% and they become particularly large for the highest energies where the hamiltonian ambiguities are also the largest .",
    "in addition there should also be an error due to the fact that in the faddeev approach , the n - target interaction in the deuteron channel has no absorption for the partial wave in which there exists a bound state .",
    "based on previous experience , we expect this effect to be smaller than the effect on the choice of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "additional faddeev calculations for the lighter targets , introducing energy dependence in the n - target interaction in the partial wave corresponding to the bound state , suggest the ambiguity on @xmath20 is only comparable to @xmath77 for @xmath0be(p , d ) at 35 mev .",

    "remnant effects do not change significantly .",

    "the finite range adiabatic model provides a practical method to analyze ( d , p ) and ( p , d ) reactions that goes well beyond dwba .",
    "one of the great advantages is that it uses nucleon optical potentials , rather than deuteron optical potentials which are far more ambiguous .",
    "however it is by no means the exact solution and in this work we quantify the errors introduced by comparing it to exact faddeev ags calculations .",
    "we choose three emblematic reactions @xmath0be(p , d)@xmath1be(g.s . ) , @xmath3c(d , p)@xmath4c(g.s . ) and @xmath6ca(d , p)@xmath7ca(g.s . ) and span a large range of beam energies .",
    "overall , we find the agreement for reactions with beam energies around 10 mev / u to be better than 10% .",
    "these results bear important implications for the reactions being measured at isotope - separator - on - line facilities as well as for the science program at the future facility for rare isotope beams .",
    "the deviation of adwa from faddeev increases with the angular momentum of the neutron bound state as well as with the separation energy of the neutron .",
    "the dependence on @xmath87 was found to be stronger than that on the separation energy .",
    "the comparison with faddeev is limited in several ways .",
    "on one hand there are limitations with fixing the three - body hamiltonian .",
    "on the other hand there are technical issues that limit the number of cases that can be studied . to address the first point , we have explored in detail the effect of different choices for the proton target interaction , namely on the proton energy used to determine the optical potential .",
    "the differences obtained are then used as a systematic uncertainty in the comparison .",
    "they are only important at the higher energy , exactly where the performance of adwa is at its worse . in this sense ,",
    "the conclusion that adwa fails for energies larger than @xmath112 is not robust .",
    "as mentioned in section ii , there are several technical limitations in the present implementation of the faddeev equations , namely the ags method in momentum space . in this respect",
    "we found @xmath6ca(d , p ) at 19.3 mev to be most challenging and close to the limit of present capabilities in obtaining converged results .",
    "since the finite range adiabatic model for ( d , p)/(p , d ) at intermediate energies appears to be well suited to describe the few - body reaction dynamics for many cases of interest , is easy to use and is not computationally intensive , it is strongly desirable that the standard reaction codes incorporate this option in a user - friendly manner .    in this work",
    "we did not consider target excitation , however it is understood that there will be many applications in which target excitation is an integral part of the reaction mechanism .",

    "<S> the finite range adiabatic wave approximation provides a practical method to analyze ( d , p ) or ( p , d ) reactions , however until now the level of accuracy obtained in the description of the reaction dynamics has not been determined . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we perform a systematic comparison between the finite range adiabatic wave approximation and the exact faddeev method . </S>",
    "<S> we include studies of @xmath0be(p , d)@xmath1be(g.s . ) at @xmath25 , 10 and 35 mev ; @xmath3c(d , p)@xmath4c(g.s . ) at @xmath57 , 12 and 56 mev and @xmath6ca(d , p)@xmath7ca(g.s . ) at @xmath519 , 56 and 100 mev . </S>",
    "<S> results show that the two methods agree within @xmath8 for a range of beam energies ( @xmath9 mev ) but differences increase significantly for very low energies and for the highest energies . </S>",
    "<S> our tests show that adwa agrees best with faddeev when the angular momentum transfer is small @xmath10 and when the neutron - nucleus system is loosely bound . </S>"
