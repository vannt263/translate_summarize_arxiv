    "the detection and characterization of low - mass companions has become one of the highest priorities of the astronomical community .",
    "radial velocity surveys have discovered over 200 extrasolar planetary companions over the past decade , and both rv surveys and coronagraphic imaging surveys have discovered an abundance of stellar - mass companions ( e.g. marcy & butler 2000 ; mccarthy & zuckerman 2004 ; metchev 2005 ; johnson et al . 2006 ; naef et al .",
    "however , very few brown dwarf companions have been identified , an unexpected result given that the observational signatures of more massive companions are far larger than those of planetary - mass companions and that free - floating brown dwarfs are very common ( kirkpatrick et al . 2000 ; luhman et al .",
    "2003 ; chiu et al .",
    "2006 ; slesnick et al .",
    "2006a , 2006b ) .",
    "this dearth of companions between the stellar and planetary mass regimes is popularly known as the `` brown dwarf desert '' .",
    "the existence and extent of the brown dwarf desert can provide key constraints on star and planet formation since it represents the extreme mass limit of both processes .    if the stellar - mass binary companions of solar - mass stars are drawn from the initial mass function ( imf ; e.g. kroupa 1995 ) or formed via some other process that preferentially forms low - mass companions ( e.g. duquennoy & mayor 1991 , hereafter dm91 ) , then brown dwarf companions should be common unless another process inhibits their formation or dynamically strips them .",
    "however , if stellar companions are formed via the fragmentation of a protostellar core , then there are no a priori expectations that brown dwarfs should form . indeed , even if fragmentation can form an extremely inequal - mass pair , the long collapse timescale for low - mass objects might lead to their preferential photoevaporation by the higher - mass , more luminous companion .",
    "it is also unclear whether brown dwarfs could form via planetary formation processes .",
    "radial velocity surveys suggest that the giant planetary mass function is well - fit by a power law , @xmath6@xmath7 , for masses of @xmath21 - 10 @xmath4 ( marcy et al . 2005 ) .",
    "if this power law extends to higher masses , there should be as many `` planetary '' companions with masses of 10 - 25 @xmath4 as with masses of 4 - 10 @xmath4 or 1.6 - 4.0 @xmath4 .",
    "an absence of these companions suggests either that the function is not a power law or that the power law is truncated by some limit .",
    "for example , submillimeter disk surveys suggest that protoplanetary disks have a mean mass of @xmath25 @xmath4 by the age of 1 - 2 myr ( andrews & williams 2005 ) , with a small fraction ( @xmath25% ) having masses of @xmath230 - 100 @xmath4 .",
    "unless massive planets are formed very early or efficiently accrete the entire disk mass , this could impose an upper cutoff on the distribution of planetary masses .",
    "the brown dwarf desert has been studied mostly at very small or very large separations .",
    "the radial velocity exoplanet surveys that have proven so successful over the past decade should have detected any brown dwarfs within their outer separation limit ( @xmath23 - 5 au ) , and they have set very low upper limits on the frequency of close brown dwarf companions to solar mass stars ( @xmath81% ; marcy & butler 2000 ; grether & lineweaver 2006 ) .",
    "similarly , high - resolution coronagraphic imaging surveys have demonstrated sufficient sensitivity to identify brown dwarf companions at typical separation limits of @xmath950 au ( e.g. gizis et al .",
    "2001 ; neuhuser et al . 2003",
    "; mccarthy & zuckerman 2004 ; neuhuser & guenther 2004 ; metchev 2005 ) .",
    "they have measured frequencies which are low , but somewhat inconsistent ( and perhaps not anomalously low ; 1@xmath101% by mccarthy & zuckerman , compared to 6.8@xmath11% by metchev and 18@xmath1014% by gizis et al . ) . a survey for wide companions to high - mass ( 2 - 8 @xmath12 ) stars in upper sco by kouwenhoven et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found a relatively low frequency for brown dwarf companions , 0.5@xmath100.5% at separations of 130 - 520 au .",
    "finally , there have been an intriguing sample of candidate planetary - mass companions identified at large separations ( e.g. chauvin et al .",
    "2004 ; neuhuser et al .",
    "2005 ) , but both their mass and formation mechanism are still uncertain and their frequency is still unconstrained ( e.g. masciadri et al .",
    "2005 ; kraus et al .",
    "2006 ; biller et al .",
    "2007 ; ahmic et al . 2007 ) .    however , these surveys do nt study the actual separation range where most giant planets and binary companions are expected to form .",
    "most giant planets at small orbital radii ( @xmath135 au ) are thought to have migrated inward , so their mass distribution may not match that of their more distant brethren .",
    "the binary formation process may also be different for small separations ( @xmath1310 au ) , with h@xmath14 dissociation softening the equation of state and leading to enhanced fragmentation over that expected for larger length scales ( whitworth & stamatellos 2006 ) .",
    "similarly , giant planets are nt expected to form at very large radii ( @xmath530 au ) since the formation timescale is too long , and the frequency of wide binary companions may differ significantly from those of closer binaries ( e.g. kraus & hillenbrand 2007a ) since the fragmentation occurs on a length scale that is several orders of magnitude larger .    ideally , the desert should be studied at the separation range where giant planets and most binaries are thought to form ( @xmath25 - 30 au ; lissauer & stephenson 2007 ; dm91 ) , but this has been impossible using existing techniques . for example , theoretical models ( chabrier et al .",
    "2000 ) suggest that a 50 @xmath4 brown dwarf located 15 au ( 1 - 2@xmath15 ) from a nearby field star will have a contrast ratio of @xmath0@xmath110 - 15 magnitudes at a separation of only @xmath21 .",
    "the contrast problem could have been addressed by observing young stars since their substellar companions would be intrinsically more luminous ( @xmath0@xmath165 mag ) , but most young stars are further away , so the separations are even smaller ( 0.1 - 0.2@xmath15 ; @xmath2@xmath17@xmath18 ) .",
    "sensitivities near the diffraction limit have traditionally been far too shallow to detect such companions .",
    "however , new advances in high - resolution imaging techniques are now opening up this critical regime ; our survey will use one such technique , non - redundant aperture mask interferometry .    the technique of non - redundant aperture masking has been well - established as a means of achieving the full diffraction limit of a single telescope ( e.g. nakajima et al .",
    "1989 ; tuthill et al .",
    "the reason for the technique s success over direct imaging is that the calibration is independent of structure of the wavefront over scales larger than a single sub - aperture , but it still preserves the angular resolution of the full aperture .",
    "this technique , when applied to seeing - limited observations , requires observations to be taken in a speckle mode with sub - apertures of diameter smaller than the atmospheric coherence length , limiting the technique to objects brighter than about @xmath19 .",
    "the use of adaptive optics allows for longer integration times and larger sub - apertures , extending the technique to much fainter targets .",
    "published detections have been able to recover astrometrically discovered binary systems with contrast ratios of 3:1 at 0.6 @xmath17@xmath18 and 100:1 at @xmath17@xmath18 ( pravdo et al .",
    "2006 ; lloyd et al . 2006",
    "; ireland et al . 2008 ) using total observation times of @xmath210 minutes .",
    "the inner limit of companion detectability at high contrast is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the longest baseline in the mask ( typically 80 - 95% of the aperture diameter ) .",
    "typical closure phase errors are such that aperture masking can unveil high contrast companions at separations  5 times closer than direct imaging in both @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands .    in this paper , we describe an aperture - mask interferometry and direct imaging survey to detect stellar and substellar companions to young stars in the nearby ob association upper scorpius .",
    "this survey directly studies the age and separation range corresponding to the peak of planet formation , offering the first glimpse of the brown dwarf desert in this critical range of parameter space . in section 2",
    ", we describe our survey sample , and in section 3 , we describe the observations and data analysis techniques . in section 4 , we summarize the results of our survey . in section 5 , we combine these results with previous binary surveys to place constraints on the stellar binary frequency , mass function , and separation distribution , and in section 6 , we consider constraints on the corresponding parameters for the planetary population . finally ,",
    "in section 7 , we discuss the implications of our survey for the extent and aridity of the brown dwarf desert .",
    "upper sco is an ideal target for large - scale surveys to detect brown dwarf or planetary companions .",
    "it is young enough ( @xmath25 myr ) that substellar companions are much more luminous than those of typical field stars , and this age is thought to be the peak epoch of giant planet formation ( lissauer & stephenson 2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "its relative proximity ( @xmath2145 pc ; de zeeuw et al .",
    "1999 ) also means that the resolution limit of large telescopes ( @xmath240 - 100 mas ; 6 - 15 au ) corresponds to the giant planet separation regime of our own solar system .",
    "finally , the association has been very intensely studied , with several hundred members identified in the past decade , so it provides a much larger sample of well - characterized members than nearby moving groups .",
    "we compiled a preliminary list of 356 targets from the known members of upper sco as compiled in kraus & hillenbrand ( 2007a ) ; this census included all spectroscopically - confirmed members with spectral type g0 or later from the recent surveys by walter et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , preibisch et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2001 , 2002 ) , kunkel ( 1999 ) , ardila et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , martin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and slesnick et al .",
    "( 2006a ) .",
    "we also added two stars that were not included in that census : rxj1550.9 - 2534 ( which was originally classified as f9 by the hd catalogue but was reclassified as g1 by the michigan spectral survey ; houk & smith - moore 1988 ) and v1149 sco ( which was not included in any large membership surveys since it was identified as a young star before they were conducted ; stephenson 1986 ) .",
    "all of our observations have been conducted from northern sites , so we removed 25 of the 26 stars south of @xmath24@xmath25 from further consideration .",
    "the only exception was rxj1550.9 - 2534 , which we retained in order to make a complete group of four science targets of similar brightness and airmass .",
    "as we describe below , preliminary imaging showed that it was an obvious binary that is not suitable for masking observations anyway , but we retain it in our sample for statistical purposes .",
    "we also rejected 230 of the remaining low - mass association members which were optically fainter than the useful limit of the ao system ( @xmath2614 ) .",
    "finally , we removed the 23 known binaries with separations of @xmath83 . in close systems , the stellar companion would have dominated the signal in our observations , complicating any search for fainter companions .",
    "wider binaries ( with separations near the seeing limit ) were rejected because they are generally not corrected well by the ao system , though we still observed several of them with direct imaging in order to test whether this would actually occur .",
    "a total of seven targets were not discovered to be binaries until we arrived at the telescope and obtained quick direct imaging observations ; these targets were also removed from the aperture mask sample .",
    "we mistakenly removed one more target , usco-160643.8 - 190805 , that we initially thought was a binary based on direct imaging .",
    "subsequent analysis showed that it was flagged as a binary erroneously ; we will not consider it in our statistical sample because we only have imaging data and not masking data .",
    "these cuts left a total of 72 upper sco members in our aperture mask sample , plus 11 members ( 10 known or new binary systems and 1 erroneous omission ) that we only observed with direct imaging .",
    "we list all of these targets in table 1 , where we also include each target s spectral type ( adopted from the discovery survey ) , mass ( as determined in section 3.3 ) , and @xmath27 and @xmath23 magnitudes , plus the target group that it was observed with ( as described in section 3.1 ) . in table 2",
    ", we list the 19 known binary systems that would have passed our selection criteria .",
    "we did not observe any of these systems , but we will include them in our sample for determining stellar binary statistics since they have known binary companions",
    ". our upper limits on the existence of planetary - mass companions will not include any known or newly - discovered binary systems .",

    "we observed our target sample in april - july 2007 with the keck - ii 10 m and palomar hale 200 \" telescopes .",
    "all observations were obtained using the facility adaptive optics imagers , nirc2 and pharo .",
    "both instruments have aperture masks permanently installed at or near the pupil plane in filter or pupil - stop wheels .",
    "the seeing quality was well above average for most of the keck observations , yielding superb ao correction for bright targets and acceptable strehl ratios ( @xmath215 - 20% ) even for targets as faint as @xmath2814 .",
    "the palomar observations were obtained under approximately median conditions ( @xmath21 seeing ) .",
    "all observations conducted at keck were obtained with a @xmath29 filter , while those conducted at palomar were obtained with a methane short filter , which is in @xmath22-band ( central wavelength 1.57@xmath30 m , bandpass 0.1@xmath30 m ) .",
    "this filter was used instead of full @xmath22-band because of calibration errors related to dispersion that had been found in previous data sets . this strategy allowed us to achieve similar resolution limits at both telescopes , despite the smaller aperture size at palomar .",
    "our palomar observations suffered a modest loss of sensitivity since the strehl is lower in @xmath22 than in @xmath29 , but the typical sensitivity limit in @xmath22 still allows us to detect a @xmath230 @xmath4 companion at 40 mas for half of our sample members . observing in @xmath23 would have yielded limits of @xmath0@xmath23@xmath131 magnitude deeper ( equivalent to @xmath0@xmath22@xmath131.5 since low - mass companions are redder in @xmath31 ) , and we decided this was not as important since the corresponding detection limits ( @xmath515 - 20 @xmath4 ) could not have reached the planetary mass range .",
    "observations at keck used a 9 hole mask , with the longest baseline 8.27 m and the shortest baseline 1.67 m .",
    "we used a multiple - correlated double sampling readout in a 512x512 subarray of the aladdin detector , with 16 endpoint reads and a 10s exposure per frame .",
    "observations at palomar with pharo also used a 9 hole mask , with the longest baseline 3.94 m and the shortest baseline 0.71 m . to maximise the number of reads",
    ", we used either a 256x256 or 150x150 sub - array mode in one quadrant of the hawaii detector , with a total of 16 or 28 reads respectively per array reset .",
    "every read was saved to disk , so that in post - processing each file could be split into sub - frames . splitting the data into more sub - frames minimises sensitivity to changing seeing or ao instabilities , and using less sub - frames minimises sensitivity to readout noise .",
    "we found that for the typical magnitudes of our targets , signal - to - noise was optimized by using read pairs separated by one read : giving 862ms exposure times for the 256x256 sub - array mode , and 430ms exposure times for the 150x150 sub - array mode .",
    "a key requirement for obtaining good contrast limits is the contemporaneous observation of calibrator sources , ideally single stars which are nearby on the sky and similar in both optical and near - infrared brightness .",
    "a typical observing mode for isolated field stars is to obtain several sets of observations for a science target , interspersing visits to calibrator stars between each science observation . as a result ,",
    "observations for a single science target might require as many as six target acquisitions ( three calibrators , plus three visits to the source ) .",
    "however , all of our science targets are located in close proximity on the sky ( @xmath810@xmath25 ) and they span a continuous range of brightness , so we were able to use the same calibrator star for multiple science targets and to intercalibrate between science targets . to this end , we divided our sample into 20 groups of @xmath24 similar - brightness stars each , then observed each group contemporaneously . specifically , we visited each group member three times , plus we obtained one visit for each of two independent field calibrators .",
    "this allowed us to typically observe four science targets with a total of 14 acquisitions , for an average of 3.5 acquisitions per target .",
    "the average total time per acquisition was @xmath24 minutes , so our strategy required @xmath215 minutes per target .",
    "we summarize the composition of our target groups and list the independent calibrators in table 3 .",
    "we also include the observation date and the mean @xmath27 and @xmath23 magnitudes for each group . some of our groups are bigger or smaller because our acquisition images showed that several intended targets were resolved binaries ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "when this occurred , we removed the binary system from our sample ; in the case of groups 12 - 15 , we found a large number of binaries , so we rearranged the group composition at the telescope and eliminated group 13 .    finally , a large fraction of our sample has been observed previously with high - resolution imaging ( brandner et al .",
    "1996 ; metchev 2005 ; bouy et al .",
    "2006 ) , so we knew a priori whether these stars had known companions .",
    "however , many of our targets have been observed only with speckle imaging ( khler et al .",
    "2000 ) or have not been observed with any high - resolution techniques .",
    "for these sources , we decided to obtain quick observations in direct - imaging mode in order to screen out obvious binaries .",
    "this also allowed us to test for companions at separations outside the nominal limit of aperture - mask interferometry ( 240 mas at palomar and 320 mas at keck ) .    in table 4 , we list all of the sources that were observed with direct imaging and summarize the observations .",
    "we observed all of these sources with nirc2 or pharo using the smallest pixel scale available ( 10 or 25 mas pix@xmath32 , respectively ) and a two - point diagonal dither pattern .",
    "faint stars were observed with a @xmath29 or @xmath33 filter , while bright stars that would have saturated the detector were observed with a @xmath34 filter , which attenuates flux by a factor of @xmath210 relative to broadband @xmath23 filters .",

    "this window both limits sensitivity to readout noise and acts as a spatial - filter .",
    "each frame is then fourier - transformed , and the complex visibility extracted for each baseline .",
    "complex visibilities can not be directly used for high - fidelity measurements because of their sensitivity to variable optical aberrations and non common path errors .",
    "instead , we use the averaged squared visibility and the complex triple product @xcite . for each visit to each star , we extract squared - visibility , closure - phase , and the uncertainties on these quantities based on the scatter within one visit .",
    "finally , the calibration process consists of estimating the instrumental squared - visibilities and closure - phases .",
    "the target star s squared visibilities are divided by the instrumental squared - visibilities and the instrumental closure - phase is subtracted from the measured closure - phase .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show a fit to data for the 27mas separation binary rxj1550.0 - 2312 .",
    "squared visibility is plotted against baseline projected along the axis of the binary . as",
    "closure - phase is a multi - dimensional quantity , we chose to simply plot the measured closure - phases versus the model closure - phases . despite this binary being at a separation of only 0.6@xmath36 , it is clear that it is an extremely - high signal - to - noise detection .",
    "note that only closure - phase was used in the fit : calibration errors are evident in the squared visibility data with the few points that have squared visibility greater than 1.0 .",
    "the error analysis procedure used to calculate the covariance matrix of closure - phase for each target is given in detail in appendix  a. for all targets , an attempt at fitting a binary solution was made , by first searching exhaustively in a grid in position angle and separation at high - contrast and then by a gradient descent search to find the @xmath37 minimum .",
    "errors in binary parameters were calculated from the curvature of the @xmath37 surface at the @xmath37 minimum ( i.e. the same method as most least - squares algorithms ) .",
    "detections were retained if their contrast was greater than a 99.9% confidence threshold .    in order to calculate a detection threshold , we simulated 10000 data sets with the identical @xmath38-sampling and error properties of each target .",
    "for each of these simulated data sets , we calculated the best fit contrast ratio for every value of separation and position angle in a large grid , and then tabulated the maximum contrast ratio ( i.e. brightest fitted companion ) within a series of annuli .",
    "our 99.9% upper limits to companion brightness within each annulus was taken to be the contrast ratio where 99.9% of the simulations had no fitted companion brighter than this limit anywhere within the annulus .",
    "details of the simulation and fitting algorithms can be found in the appendix  a.      the imaging data were flat - fielded and dark- and bias - subtracted using standard iraf procedures .",
    "we measured psf - fitting photometry and astrometry for our sources using the iraf package daophot ( stetson 1987 ) , and specifically with the allstar routine .",
    "where possible , we analyzed each frame separately in order to estimate the uncertainty in individual measurements and to allow for the potential rejection of frames with inferior ao correction ; our final results represent the mean value for all observations in a filter .",
    "if the companion could not be easily distinguished in a single filter , we measured photometry from the coadded sum of all images at each dither position .    in all cases , we used the science target ( or the primary star of a binary ) to produce an analytic psf composed of a gaussian core with lorentzian wings . if the science target was a close binary , we reconstructed the psf using the algorithm described in kraus & hillenbrand ( 2007b ) , which iteratively fits a template psf to the primary and then subtracts the secondary to fit an improved estimate of the primary .",
    "three sources appeared to be marginally detected in our observations ; we retained these sources in our aperture mask sample and later confirmed their multiplicity ( section 4 ) , so we processed their images with our psf reconstruction routine and report the results .",
    "finally , we calibrated our photometry using the known 2mass @xmath33 magnitudes for each of our science targets ; these absolute magnitudes are uncertain by @xmath20.1 - 0.2 magnitudes due to the intrinsic variability of young stars ( resulting from accretion or rotation ) .    at small separations ( @xmath135@xmath17@xmath18 ) ,",
    "our imaging data for apparently single stars will be superceded by our aperture mask data , so the detection limits are not important . at larger separations ( @xmath55@xmath17@xmath18 ) ,",
    "where spurious sources corresponding to ao speckles dominate , we adopted the detection limits suggested by metchev ( 2005 ) for similar observations : @xmath0@xmath39 at 250 - 500 mas , @xmath0@xmath40 at 500 - 1000 mas , and the sky background limit ( @xmath116.5 - 17.5 ) at separations of @xmath51 .",
    "we tested these limits for a set of the apparently single stars in our sample by subtracting an analytic psf from the science target , then compiling the statistics for all apparently spurious detections . in all cases ,",
    "the ao speckles fall at least a magnitude below our adopted limits .",
    "finally , the nirc2 images were distortion - corrected using new high - order distortion solutions ( p.b .",
    "cameron , in prep ) that deliver a significant performance increase as compared to the solutions presented in the nirc2 pre - ship manual ; the typical absolute residuals for bright , well - resolved stars are @xmath131 mas in narrow camera mode .",
    "the pharo images were distortion - corrected using the solution derived by metchev ( 2005 ) , with fractional uncertainties in relative astrometry of @xmath20.15% .",
    "these uncertainties limit our astrometry for most close , well - resolved binary systems .",
    "the uncertainty for wider ( @xmath52 - 3 ) pairs seems to be driven by variation due to differential tilt jitter , while the uncertainty for close blended pairs is driven by our ability to accurately model the single - star psf .",
    "stellar properties can be difficult to estimate , particularly for young stars , since pre - main - sequence stellar evolutionary models are not well - calibrated",
    ". the mass of a given sample could be systematically uncertain by as much as 20% ( e.g. hillenbrand & white 2004 ) , and individual masses could be uncertain by factors of 2 or more due to unresolved multiplicity or the intrinsic variability that young stars often display ( from accretion or rotational modulation of star spots ) .",
    "this suggests that any prescription for determining stellar properties should be treated with caution .",
    "we estimated the properties of all of our sample members using the methods described in kraus & hillenbrand ( 2007a ) .",
    "this procedure combines the 5 myr isochrone of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the temperature scales of schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) and luhman et al . ( 2003 ) to directly convert observed spectral types to masses .",
    "relative properties ( mass ratios @xmath41 ) for all binaries in our sample were calculated by combining these isochrones and temperature scales with the empirical nir colors of bessell & brett ( 1998 ) and the k - band bolometric corrections of leggett et al .",

    "for all binary systems , we have adopted the previously - measured ( unresolved ) spectral type for the brightest component and inferred its properties from that spectral type .",
    "this should be a robust assumption since equal - flux binary components will have similar spectral types and significantly fainter components would not have contributed significant flux to the original discovery spectrum .",
    "projected spatial separations are calculated assuming the mean distance of upper sco , 145@xmath102 pc ( de zeeuw et al .",
    "if the total radial depth of upper sco is equal to its angular extent ( @xmath108@xmath25 or @xmath1020 pc ) , then the unknown depth of each system within upper sco implies an uncertainty in the projected spatial separation of @xmath1014% .",
    "the systematic uncertainty due to the uncertainty in the mean distance of upper sco is negligible in comparison ( @xmath132% ) .",
    "finally , the sensitivity limits for some of our sample members extend to the bottom of the brown dwarf mass range and could potentially encompass the top of the planetary mass range",
    ". however , mass estimates for young giant planets are completely uncalibrated and there are ongoing debates regarding their peak and typical luminosities .",
    "the models of baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) imply that a survey sensitive to @xmath116 could detect 7 - 10 @xmath4 planets at the distance and age of upper sco . however , more detailed models of planet formation by marley et al . ( 2007 ) suggest that the typical luminosity of a young planet could be 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than previously predicted .",
    "these models differ primarily in their treatment of the initial conditions ; recent models suggest that accretion shocks could dispel much of the initial energy , leading to lower internal entropy and correspondingly lower initial temperatures than the earlier models predicted .",
    "we can not currently resolve this controversy , so we only note that our limits on the presence of massive planets should be considered with caution .",

    "the detection limits decline rapidly between @xmath2@xmath17@xmath42 and @xmath2@xmath44@xmath45 , but they are relatively flat at larger separations , extending to contrast ratios of @xmath25.0 - 6.5 magnitudes at keck and @xmath24.5 - 5.5 magnitudes at palomar .    the system rxj1550.0 - 2312 was observed on separate nights with separate calibrator sets at keck in order to confirm the accuracy and repeatablity of our measurements .",
    "the separations and contrast ratios measured at each epoch agree to within @xmath81 @xmath46 , suggesting that our results are repeatable and our assessed uncertainties are valid .",
    "we also we note that three of our calibrators appear to have companions .",
    "we did not use these observations in our final data calibration , and we report their astrometry in table 4 for completeness .",
    "finally , we note that the system gsc 06209 - 00735 has been previously identified as an sb1 by guenther et al .",
    "the orbital period that they derived ( 2045@xmath1016 d ) is consistent with the projected separation ( 25@xmath105 mas ; 3.6@xmath100.7 au ) of our newly - imaged companion , so these detections appear to denote the same companion .",
    "two more astrometric detections should allow us to resolve the orbital parameters which were not determined in the rv orbit ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ) and directly measure the masses of both stars .    in table 7",
    ", we summarize the observed properties of 7 newly - detected binary systems discovered in our snapshot imaging program , three systems which were discovered in our aperture mask survey and subsequently recovered in our imaging data , and 9 known binary systems for which we report updated properties . in figure 3 , we show the corresponding discovery images for our newly - discovered binaries .",
    "we do not report any new candidate companions discovered outside a radius of 2or with @xmath5015 because of the significant probability that any such companions are background stars .",
    "we have previously estimated the density of background stars brighter than @xmath115 to be @xmath21 arcmin@xmath51 ( kraus & hillenbrand 2007a ) , so the expected number of such contaminants inside @xmath23is only @xmath21 . however , there are many background bulge giants with apparent brightness @xmath116 - 17 that could be mistaken for faint wide companions , so an extension of these limits will require second - epoch observations to confirm common proper motion .",
    "finally , we note that 4 of these sources fell near or inside the detection limits of the speckle interferometry survey of khler et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; their nondetection is most likely explained by an unfavorable orbital phase in 1994 - 1995 and 14 years of orbital motion .    in table 8 , we list the inferred stellar and binary properties for each of our newly - identified binary systems and the binary systems that we collated from the literature . in figures 4 and 5 , we plot the contrast ratio and mass ratio versus the separation of all of our newly - detected companions , plus the corresponding detection limits for apparently single stars .",
    "the vast majority of our newly - identified candidate companions sit well above our survey s detection limits , suggesting that they are all valid detections .",
    "their typical flux ratios ( @xmath0@xmath523 ) indicate that they have stellar masses .",
    "both panels of figure 3 show an obvious dearth of companions with flux ratios @xmath0@xmath533 , corresponding roughly to the substellar mass range",
    ". our survey should have clearly detected any source in this range of parameter space , as has been proven for orbital monitoring of field binaries like gj 802 ( lloyd et al .",
    "2006 ; ireland et al .",
    "2008 ) , so this deficit seems to represent a genuine absence of companions .",
    "finally , we did not detect any candidate companions near the typical detection limits of our survey , which correspond to 99.9% confidence limits in any single separation bin or @xmath299.5% across all separation bins .",
    "we would expect an average of 0.3 false detections for the 60 targets listed in table 6 , so our nondetection is consistent with the statistical estimate .",
    "we did detect four candidate companions with lower confidence levels ( 99.5 - 99.9% in their separation bin , corresponding to overall confidence levels of @xmath297.5%-99.5% ) .",

    "the properties of multiple star systems are important diagnostics for placing constraints on star formation processes . a comprehensive theory of star formation should be able to reproduce the observed separation distribution , mass ratio distribution , and total fraction of binary systems , as well as any mass or environmental dependences of these properties .",
    "the mass ratio distribution also plays a critical role in defining the brown dwarf desert since the bottom tail of the distribution represents the upper bound of the desert .",
    "most recent efforts to model binary formation have typically assumed that stellar and prestellar interactions play a key role in establishing binary properties .",
    "the most popular type of model assumes that a cluster of 5 - 10 protostellar embryos form from a single turbulently fragmenting cloud core ( e.g. kroupa 1995 ; sterzik & durisen 1998 ; kroupa & bouvier 2003 ; kroupa et al .",
    "2003 ; delgado - donate et al .",
    "2003 ; hubber et al .",
    "2005 ) ; these embryos would then undergo mass accretion and dynamical evolution to form single stars and stable multiple systems . however , other stellar properties place strong limits on the rate of early dynamical evolution .",
    "close stellar encounters would tend to dissipate or truncate disks , with smaller stars having fewer and shorter - lived disks , but there is no evidence for this trend ( e.g. white & basri 2003 ; luhman 2004 ; scholz et al .",
    "dynamical encounters might also eject lower - mass stars and brown dwarfs , but no such ejected population is seen ( luhman 2006 ) , though some models suggest that strong ejections might be rare ( bate & bonnell 2005 ) .",
    "finally , any dynamically active environment would truncate the stellar binary separation distribution for all stars in the association .",
    "the absence of low - mass wide binaries has often been interpreted as a sign of this process , but this absence is seen even in environments where the wide binary frequency is very high for solar - mass stars ( kraus & hillenbrand 2007a ) , so it may have another explanation .    modeling efforts that concentrate on other binary formation processes have not advanced sufficiently to make any rigorous prediction .",

    "all of these processes are more significant for isolated cores than for the dynamically - active turbulent fragmentation scenario discussed above , so the limits on dynamical activity of young stars suggest that they should be considered in more detail in the future .",
    "given the absence of theoretical predictions , we are left only with empirical comparisons to other samples . previous field multiplicity surveys ( dm91 ; fischer & marcy 1992 , hereafter fm92 ; reid & gizis 1997 , hereafter rg97 ) have suggested a range of possible results for the separation distribution , mass ratio distribution , and total frequency of binary systems .",
    "we will compare our results to these surveys and to the expected result if binary companions are drawn from an imf .",
    "none of these explanations produce an acceptable fit for our mass ratio distribution , so the next step is to test other analytic distributions .",
    "our number statistics do not support strong constraints on this analysis yet , so we will limit our analysis to a single functional form ( the log - normal distribution ) until we conclude the second half of our survey , an examination of young stars in taurus .",
    "finally , we note that two of the systems among our sample ( usco-160428.4 - 190441 and usco-160825.1 - 201224 ) would have fallen below the optical flux limit of our sample ( @xmath5414 , imposed by the ao system ) if the primaries were single .",
    "including these systems in our statistical analysis would bias our results toward higher binary frequencies , so we have omitted them from our subsequent analysis .",
    "there is also an opposing effect due to the inclusion of unresolved binary pairs ( which we identify as single stars ) that would be omitted by the same criterion if we knew they were binaries .",
    "we obviously ca nt identify these systems , so we only note that the effect should be small .",
    "if the binary frequency at small separations is @xmath210 - 20% and the mass ratio distribution is similar to the distribution we observe , then no more than 1 - 2 unresolved systems should be included as `` single stars '' .",
    "this systematic bias should not be significant compared to the statistical uncertainties in our results .",
    "we also note that our entire analysis must implicitly adopt the assumption that the mass ratio distribution and separation distribution are uncorrelated over the survey s separation range",

    "all of the number statistics are only moderately significant , but they still suffice for placing limits on the range of functional forms for the primordial mass ratio distribution",

    "however , our data will suffice to test previously - suggested functions . to this end , we have compared our results to three distributions : a gaussian distribution like that suggested by dm91 , a constant distribution like that suggested by fm92 , and a distribution which was assembled by assuming stars are randomly drawn from the imf of upper sco .",

    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test is more sensitive in cases where the bin size is a significant fraction of the total range of parameter space or when the trial distribution function changes rapidly accross a bin , so all of our conclusions are based on its results .",

    "their survey was not sensitive to substellar companions ( @xmath55 ) , but if this functional form is valid , it suggests that substellar companions should be very common ( @xmath6210% , with 4% falling in our survey s separation range ) .",
    "however , there are no physical motivations for assuming that an arbitrarily chosen segment of a gaussian function ( -0.5@xmath46 to + 2.0@xmath46 ) should predict the mass ratio distribution , so any similarity may be a coincidence .",

    "this distribution was originally defined for all separations , but dm91 found that only 40% of their systems fell within our survey s separation range , so we have scaled their function by this amount .",

    "this level of disagreement could be a result of our wider mass range than dm91 s sample since lower - mass binary systems are thought to have mass ratios that are not as biased toward low masses .",
    "the relative levels of agreement for our high - mass and low - mass subsamples support this assessment ; the high - mass subsample is only somewhat inconsistent with the dm91 distribution , while the low - mass subsample is very significantly inconsistent .",
    "a field binary survey by fm92 found that the mass ratio distribution for field early m dwarfs seemed to be better fit by a flat distribution of mass ratios for @xmath630.4 .",
    "rg97 found that this flat distribution extends to much lower mass ratio distributions for m dwarfs , though they also suggested the existence of a possible peak near unity ( @xmath630.8 ) .",
    "as with the gaussian distribution , a flat distribution would suggest that substellar companions are not uncommon relative to stars , but these survey were not sensitive enough to actually detect most brown dwarf secondaries .",
    "their total binary fractions ( 20@xmath64@xmath65% for @xmath66 or 16@xmath64@xmath67% for all @xmath41 , respectively , in this separation range ) are marginally inconsistent , but the rg97 sample ( which is more rigorously volume - limited ) contains 17 of the 37 binary systems considered by fm92 , so we will adopt their value . in the three left - hand panels of figure 6 ,",
    "we plot the flat @xmath41 distribution suggested by rg97 with a green dashed line .",
    "visual inspection suggests that a constant distribution might be more appropriate for our sample s @xmath41 distribution than the dm91 gaussian distribution .",
    "however , the flat distribution of rg97 appears to fall systematically too low for the full sample and both subsamples , yielding high @xmath58@xmath59 values .",
    "if we renormalize the flat distribution to match our overall binary frequency ( 36@xmath68 ) , we find much better agreement .",
    "the corresponding kolmogorov - smirnov tests , which only measure the cumulative density function and implicity include our renormalization , also find that a constant distribution is consistent or perhaps marginally inconsistent .",
    "we also note that we found no clear evidence of an excess of equal - mass binaries ; the 2-sigma upper limit in the highest - mass bin of our entire sample ( @xmath69 ) is @xmath7011.4% .",
    "some theories also suggest that binary companions could be drawn randomly from the imf . this idea used to be popular since it could be naturally explained as a result of random pairing and because previous results were moderately consistent , but it has fallen out of favor as the role of dynamical interactions has been increasingly constrained .",
    "however , an imf could still be valid for wide binaries ( which may form during the turbulent fragmentation of a large cloud core ) and it is not clear where this regime ends and where the binary fragmentation of a collapsing protostar begins .",
    "this suggests that it would be prudent to test the validity of an imf - based @xmath41 distribution .",
    "we adopted our imf ( hereafter the companion mass function , or cmf ) from the spectroscopic membership surveys of preibisch et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2002 ) , and slesnick et al .",
    "( 2006a , 2007 ) ; this imf can be described by a broken power law , @xmath71@xmath72@xmath73@xmath74 , where @xmath75 for @xmath76 @xmath12 , @xmath77 for @xmath78 @xmath12 , and @xmath79 for @xmath80 @xmath12 .",
    "we derived the expected @xmath41 distribution for our sample by assuming that every binary primary had a companion randomly drawn from the lower - mass regime of the cmf .",
    "most implementations of this process use monte carlo simulations to draw a suitable population from the cmf , but our cmf is defined as a simple analytic function , so we chose to directly convert it into a @xmath41 distribution : @xmath81@xmath73@xmath71@xmath82 , where the full distribution @xmath83 is the normalized sum of all functions @xmath84 as defined for each binary primary .",
    "in the three left - hand panels of figure 6 , we plot our imf - based @xmath41 distribution with a red long - dashed line . unlike the previous two distributions ,",
    "our imf - based distribution is fundamentally different for our entire sample and for each subsample since they represent different sets of primary masses .",
    "the bottom - heavy nature of the imf suggests that of all sources with masses @xmath131 @xmath12 , approximately 1/4 should be substellar and many of the rest should fall at the very bottom of the stellar mass range .",
    "this distribution disagrees very significantly with our results , and all statistical tests conclusively rule out the possibility that the companions in our sample might have been randomly drawn from the imf .",
    "as well as simply testing fixed distributions , we can use bayesian analysis to draw conclusions about the most likely models from a class of distributions .",
    "we chose distributions that are log - normal in @xmath41 ( base-10 ) , with a mean at @xmath85 .",
    "we chose this distribution because it is based on the following ad - hoc model : beginning with two equal - mass cores , we accrete matter stochastically onto the two cores such that the mean accretion rate onto each core is proportional to the core mass . applying the central limit theorem to the logarithm of the core mass ratio , we arrive at a log - normal distribution in @xmath41 .",
    "this distribution also has the important property that the functional form is the same in @xmath86 as in @xmath41 , meaning that it does not matter whether the `` primary '' or `` secondary '' star is used as the reference for calculating @xmath41 . amongst differentiable @xmath41 distributions , only distributions that have an asymptotic power - law slope of -1 at @xmath85 can be written so that they have this property .",
    "this distribution has a corresponding probability density function :    @xmath87    the likelihood function is then given by :    @xmath88    the normalization in this equation explicitly includes our lower limit for @xmath41 . using a uniform prior on @xmath46 , we find that the best fit value of @xmath46 is @xmath89 .",
    "this is our best fit distribution of all tested distributions , and predicts that only 1.2% of all companions are brown dwarfs in our separation range ( meaning @xmath90 here ) .",
    "it reproduces the peak in the companion distribution at @xmath91 similar to that seen by dm91 , but without the lack of near equal - mass companions predicted by their preferred distribution .",
    "the low - mass subsample has a best fit value of @xmath46 of @xmath92 , and the high - mass subsample has a best fit @xmath46 of @xmath93 .",
    "these values of @xmath46 are significantly different at the 96% level .",
    "this demonstrates that the lower mass subsample prefers more equal - mass companions to the higher mass subsample , consistent with results for low - mass binaries in the field .",
    "we have plotted all three best - fitting log - normal distributions in the right - hand panels of figure 6 ( magenta dashed line ) .",
    "field surveys have also suggested that the separation distribution depends strongly on mass ; the shape seems to be log - normal for a wide range of masses , but the mean and maximum separations decline with decreasing mass .",
    "dm91 found that the separation distribution for solar - mass stars has a mean separation of @xmath230 au and some binaries as wide as 10@xmath94 au . fm92 and rg97 found that early m binaries have a mean separation which is marginally consistent ( 4 - 30 au ) , but few have separations @xmath510@xmath95 au .",
    "finally , recent surveys have shown that late m dwarfs and brown dwarfs have very small mean and maximum separations ( 4 and 20 au , respectively ; close et al .",
    "2003 ; bouy et al .",
    "2003 ; burgasser et al .",
    "2003 ) . as we described above , many field stars formed in denser environments , so there has probably been some dynamical evolution that disrupted wide binaries . however , surveys of older clusters ( e.g. patience et al . 2002 ) suggest that the old binary population is only severely depleted by intra - cluster dynamical interactions at separations of @xmath5100 - 200 au .",
    "this suggests that only the outer edge of our sample s separation distribution should differ significantly from the field .",
    "interpretation of the companion separation distribution is usually complicated by observational realities .",
    "the most meaningful quantity to consider is the distribution of semimajor axes , but the semimajor axis can only be determined as part of an orbital solution .",
    "some authors convert the projected separation for each star into an estimated semimajor axis using a single corrective factor ( typically @xmath96 ) , but this choice is only valid on a statistical level and carries implicit assumptions about the eccentricity distribution that are extrapolated from much shorter - period binaries .",
    "therefore , we choose to report the observed projected separation distribution only . in the right side of figure 6 , we plot histograms of the separation distributions for our entire sample , only the higher - mass fgk stars , and only the lower - mass m dwarfs .",
    "this distribution spans separations of 6 - 435 au , the range where our survey is sensitive to most brown dwarf companions .",
    "we find that the separation distribution for our sample is consistent with a distribution constant with log(@xmath97 ) , with @xmath97 the apparent separation on the sky .",
    "a one - sided kolmogorov - smirnoff test over the separation range 6 - 435au gives @xmath98 , with @xmath99 . in order to examine what our separation distribution is not consistent with ,",
    "we have also attempted to fit log - normal distributions over the separation range 6 - 435 au , where the likelihood of a particular value of the mean @xmath30 and standard deviation @xmath46 is given by :    @xmath100    as in the previous subsection , the normalization on the denominator is an explicit integral rather than the standard normalization for a gaussian because of our artificial truncation of the distribution at 6 and 435au .",
    "we take the prior distribution of @xmath30 to be uniform between 0 and 3 ( i.e. median separations between 1 and 1000au ) , and the prior distribution of @xmath46 to be uniform between 0 and 2 .",
    "the most likely values of @xmath30 and @xmath46 are then 1.44 and 1.01 for the entire sample , 1.08 and 0.79 for the high - mass sample , and 1.92 and 0.97 for the low - mass sample . however , integrating over all @xmath30 , the most likely value of @xmath46 is our upper limit of 2 , demonstrating that the data is consistent with an approximately flat distribution .",
    "the most important point to come out of this analysis is that the 90% confidence lower limit on @xmath46 is 0.94 , suggesting that we have detected at most two thirds of the companions in our sample , with the remaining companions being at smaller or greater separations .",
    "the separation distributions for the high and low - mass samples follows the opposite trend to that suggested in the literature .",
    "our low - mass sample has a median separation of 81au , while our high - mass sample has a median separation of 21au .",
    "this difference is not statistically significant since both distributions are consistent with a constant distribution , and a 2-sided kolmogorov - smirnoff test gives a difference statistic @xmath101 , with @xmath102 .",
    "it is interesting , however , that we do not see the trend toward smaller separations with lower masses as seen in field dwarfs ( e.g. allen ( 2007 ) , who finds @xmath103 and @xmath104 for ultracool field dwarfs ) .",
    "we hope to repeat this analysis with more conclusive results after we complete our survey sample .",
    "the total binary fraction , representing the integrated separation and mass ratio distributions , provides a useful comparison for different populations .",
    "it does not provide any additional information about the binary formation process that is not implicitly included in its component distributions , but it is very useful in other contexts like correcting the imf for undetected multiplicity or relating the imf to the prestellar core mass function .",
    "previous surveys suggest that the binary fraction is close to unity for early - type stars , declining to @xmath260% for solar - mass stars , and @xmath230% for early m stars ; in all cases , @xmath240 - 50% of binaries fall within the same separation range as our survey ( 6 - 435 au ) .",
    "we found binary fractions of 35@xmath105@xmath67% for our entire sample , 33@xmath64@xmath65 for our high - mass ( fgk ) subsample , and 38@xmath64@xmath106% for our low - mass ( early m ) subsample .",
    "the first two results are roughly consistent with those observed in the field , but the second result is significantly higher than the value observed in the field .",
    "a survey of wide multiplicity has found that there are only four binaries with separations of 3 - 30 among our sample members ( kraus & hillenbrand 2007a ; kraus & hillenbrand , in preparation ) , but there are likely to be a significant number at smaller separations ; we discovered some of these binaries inside the nominal completeness limit of our survey , and future rv surveys are likely to uncover many more .",
    "if the binary fraction at separations @xmath136 au is as high in upper sco as in the field , then the binary fraction for early m dwarfs in upper sco could be as high as is observed for field f - g dwarfs ( @xmath560% ) .",
    "in the past 15 years , the search for extrasolar planets has become one of the major goals of the astronomical community .",
    "radial velocity searches have discovered hundreds of planets and allowed us to probe the dynamics of planetary systems ( e.g. marcy et al .",
    "2005 ) , and more recently , transit searches have uncovered dozens of additional planets and allowed us to study their fundamental properties ( masses and radii ; odonovan et al .",
    "2007 ; torres 2007 ) .",
    "however , the direct observation of extrasolar planetary systems has proven to be an elusive goal .",
    "advances in high - resolution imaging ( mostly aimed at speckle suppression ) are allowing for increasingly strict upper limits on their existence , but no planetary companions at separations comparable to our own solar system have been directly imaged yet",
    ". an intriguing sample of candidate planetary - mass companions have been identified at much wider separations ( e.g. chauvin et al .",
    "2004 ; neuhuser et al . 2005 ) , but their mass and formation mechanism are still uncertain .",
    "the difficulty of directly detecting extrasolar planets with existing methods suggests that a change of strategy is in order .",
    "previous surveys have typically used spectral or rotational differential imaging ( masciadri et al . 2005 ; biller et al .",
    "2007 ; lafreniere et al . 2007 ) to cancel ao speckles , though some surveys have also used direct imaging ( typically in the mid - infrared ; kasper et al .",
    "2007 ) and simply accepted the inherent limits from speckle noise .",
    "all of these surveys produce their deepest limits at wide separations ( @xmath50.5 ) , so they can only probe the regime of likely planet formation ( 5 - 30 au ) for relatively nearby stars ( @xmath10730 pc ) ; even for these stars , existing surveys can not probe deep enough to identify old ( @xmath108@xmath51 gyr ) planets , so they must study intermediate - age ( @xmath108@xmath210 - 200 myr ) members of nearby moving groups .",
    "by contrast , our survey achieves its deepest limits at much smaller angular separations , so we can probe deeper into the planetary separation regime of nearby moving group members ( ireland & kraus , in prep ) and finally systematically survey the nearest very young associations like upper sco .",
    "however , we must include a cautionary note : the fact that we found no high - confidence planetary detections could allow us to place upper limits on the existence of massive jupiter analogues , but as we have previously described , it could also show that current models severely overestimate the luminosity of young planets .",
    "the core - accretion models which predicted this underluminosity have difficulty producing 10 @xmath4 planets , so it is possible that massive planets are formed via disk fragmentation ( which may not suffer this underluminosity ) .",
    "however , all of our subsequent results should be taken with some skepticism .",
    "we list all of our detection limits in table 6 , so if the models are updated in the future , it should be trivial to re - analyze our results and produce new limits .",
    "we expect that the planetary population over our range of interest will be described by three parameters : the total frequency @xmath109 , a power - law mass distribution @xmath110@xmath111 , and a power - law semimajor axis distribution @xmath112@xmath113 .",
    "we can place constraints on these parameters by simulating a population of planetary systems for each set of parameters , then convolving this population with our detection limits to determine the level of consistency with our nondetection .",
    "our survey s detection limits ca nt be directly translated into limits on the planetary population since planets could be obscured by projection effects , so for each simulated planet , we also invoke a random inclination angle , a random true anomaly , and an eccentricity drawn from the approximately gaussian distribution observed for radial velocity planets ( juric & tremaine 2007 ) .",
    "we note that juric & tremaine chose to fit their eccentricity distribution with a schwartzschild function , but given the uncertainties in the observational statistics , it is not possible to determine whether a schwartzschild or gaussian function is more appropriate .",
    "we have adopted the more computationally convenient form .",
    "our specific implementation uses a mass drawn from between 1 and 30 @xmath4 , a semimajor axis drawn from between 3 and 36 au , and an eccentricity drawn from a gaussian distribution between 0.0 and 0.8 with mean @xmath30@xmath114 and standard deviation @xmath46@xmath114 .",
    "we do not directly model the planetary frequency @xmath109 in our monte carlo routine because it can be added analytically .",
    "we adopted the upper mass limit ( 30 @xmath4 ) to match the most massive t tauri disks at ages of 1 - 2 myr ( only @xmath21% of which significantly exceed this mass ; andrews & williams 2005 ) .",
    "after conducting our simulations for a range of values of @xmath109 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , we compiled a three - dimensional probability density function @xmath117 which corresponds to the probability that we would have detected a planet , then extracted three - dimensional confidence surfaces which correspond to the 50% , 90% , 95% , and 99% probabilities that our observations actually would have found no planets .",
    "it is difficult to present a set of three - dimensional confidence surfaces in a two - dimensional medium , so we have chosen to present a selection of two - dimensional slices where we fix one parameter to its current best - estimated value .",
    "the statistics of radial velocity surveys have finally become significant enough to suggest possible values of our distribution parameters , so we have adopted these canonical values ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 ; marcy et al .",
    "2005 ) to produce our three confidence plots .",
    "the canonical distribution values are derived from radial velocity surveys ; they have found the power - law exponents @xmath115 and @xmath116 for their sample of ( short - period ) planets , and they extrapolate that @xmath25% of their sample members have long - term linear rv trends suggestive of massive long - period planets .",
    "the power law exponents may not be valid since many gas giants at small separations are thought to have migrated there , but these values represent the best constraint available .",
    "in the three panels of figure 7 , we present the joint confidence intervals for each pair of values if we fix the third value to the canonical estimate .",
    "these results suggest that the canonical planetary distribution can only be ruled out at the @xmath250% level .",
    "this is not a statistically significant level , but it is much better than any previous imaging survey could have achieved .",
    "we also find that a much higher planetary frequency is significantly ruled out for most values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 ; the only values which are consistent require either the mass function or the separation distribution to be very steep , placing most planets in a regime that our survey can not search .",
    "otherwise , we can not rule out significant regions of parameter space .",
    "in particular , if the canonical planetary frequency ( @xmath1215% ) is accurate , then we can not place any constraints beyond the 70% level on values of @xmath115 or @xmath116 .",
    "this is a straightforward result of our sample size ; with 60 targets , a frequency of 5% suggests that only 3 wide planets exist in our sample . only unrealistically top - heavy",
    "mass or separation distributions would place a significant number of planets in our survey s detection limits .",
    "finally , we can determine a direct constraint on the total frequency of wide high - mass planets by adopting the canonical values for both @xmath115 and @xmath116 , reducing the confidence surface to a confidence interval .",
    "if we assume that @xmath115@xmath122 and @xmath116@xmath123 , then there is a 90% probability that @xmath124 and a 95% probability that @xmath125 .",
    "we can not place similar limits on @xmath115 and @xmath116 because these confidence limits correspond to a total of 2.3 and 3.0 expected detections , respectively ; if the total planetary frequency is only @xmath118 , then only extremely top - heavy power laws would allow for that many expected detections among our 60 targets .",
    "our survey did not identify any faint companions at a confidence level of @xmath599.5% , but it did identify four faint candidate companions at confidence levels of 97.5% to 99.5% . based on our total sample size ( 60 targets ) , the expected number of spurious detections with a confidence level @xmath997.5% is only @xmath21.5 ; according to poisson statistics , the probability of identifying 4 or more of these spurious detections is only 7% , so this seems to represent a marginally significant excess .",
    "we will try to obtain followup observations for each marginal detection in the upcoming observing season ; given their faintness , any genuine companion in this group could represent the first directly - imaged massive jupiter analogue .",
    "many multiplicity surveys suggest that the binary companion mass function declines as it enters the brown dwarf mass range , and all results from rv surveys suggest the same for the planetary mass function . in light of these results",
    ", it is not surprising that brown dwarf companions are uncommon .",
    "the interesting question is whether they are more uncommon than predicted by the tails of both mass functions ; if so , then this deficit genuinely represents a brown dwarf `` desert '' .",
    "our results suggest that the stellar mass ratio distribution is constant or at least not biased heavily toward low - mass companions .",
    "given our observed total binary fraction ( 35@xmath3% ) , a constant mass ratio distribution predicts that @xmath23.5% of all stars should have a substellar or nearly - substellar companion with @xmath126 at separations of 6 - 435 au .",
    "we have found two such companions ( 1.8@xmath127% ) , a result which is entirely consistent with that claim .",
    "however , both companions fall at the upper end of this range ( @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) , and only one is possibly substellar ( @xmath1300.07 @xmath12 ) ; given the uncertainties inherent to our estimates of stellar properties , it is not inconceivable that both companions could fall in the range @xmath131 .",
    "this would be consistent with estimates for wide companions to much higher - mass upper sco members ; kouwenhoven et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that only 0.5@xmath100.5% of the b and a stars in upper sco have substellar companions with separations of 130 - 520 au .",
    "our estimate of the contribution from planetary formation processes is much more uncertain .",
    "if the planetary distribution is truly defined by the canonical values given in the literature ( @xmath118 , @xmath115@xmath122 , and @xmath116@xmath123 ) and the models describing luminosities of young planets are correct , then our survey would have had a 50% chance of detecting one `` planetary '' companion of any mass @xmath830 @xmath4 .",
    "this probability would have been higher if the planetary mass function extends beyond 30 @xmath4 with no cutoff , but even a cutoff at 100 @xmath4 would imply that our null detection is significant at only @xmath275% . as a result , we can not state with any confidence that the canonical values are incorrect or that there is any sort of high - mass cutoff in the planetary mass function .",
    "we present the results of a survey for stellar and substellar companions to 82 young stars in the nearby ob association upper scorpius .",
    "this survey used nonredundant aperture - mask interferometry to achieve typical contrast limits of @xmath0@xmath15 - 6 at the diffraction limit , revealing 12 new companions that lay below the detection limits of traditional high - resolution imaging ; we also summarize a complementary snapshot imaging survey that discovered 7 directly resolved companions .",
    "the overall frequency of binary companions ( @xmath233@xmath3% at separations of 6 - 435 au , including companions reported in the literature ) appears to be similar to field stars of similar mass , but the companion mass function appears to be more biased toward equal - mass companions than the equivalent mass function in the field .",
    "this result could indicate an environmental or dynamical effect , but our number statistics are not yet sufficient to place strong constraints on its nature .",
    "our survey limits encompass the entire brown dwarf mass range and we detected two companions with @xmath1320.1 , a number which is consistent with a flat mass ratio distribution . however , both of these companions have mass ratios near 0.1 and only one has a mass which might fall below the substellar boundary , so we hesitate to rule out the existence of any deficit that might denote a brown dwarf `` desert '' .",
    "our survey s deep detection limits also extend into the top of the planetary mass function ; we have not identified any planetary companions at high confidence ( @xmath599.5% ) , but we have identified four candidate companions at lower confidence ( @xmath597.5% ) that merit additional followup to confirm or disprove their existence .",
    "the lack of planets within the brown dwarf mass range also is not a significant proof of the existence of a desert .",
    "finally , we note that our survey results are extremely encouraging with respect to the potential for future discoveries .",
    "we are currently extending our survey efforts to the taurus - auriga star forming region and to several nearby moving groups , and this expansion of our sample should make any conclusions much more robust . our ability to precisely measure astrometry for close ( @xmath22 - 3 au ) binary systems could also allow us to measure dynamical masses for many young stars on a timescale of @xmath135 yr . finally , achieving similar detection limits for planetary - mass companions in taurus - auriga and the nearby moving groups",
    "will significantly enhance our limits on the properties of young planets ; a similar null detection for our full sample would significantly rule out the canonical values for the planetary distribution function , confirming either that these values are wrong or that evolutionary models significantly overestimate the luminosity ( and detectability ) of young planets .",
    "for each set of @xmath133 frames ( called a _ run _ ) , with @xmath134 , we calculate the mean closure phase vector @xmath135 and an estimate for the covariance matrix of closure - phase :      here @xmath137 is the closure - phase vector calculated for a single frame and @xmath138 represents a transpose . the variance in closure - phase calculated by this technique ( the diagonal of @xmath139 ) will be called @xmath140 .    studentizing all statistics",
    "was seen as an excessively difficult task , given the high number of dimensions in our data set , the strong correlations between measured parameters and the need to have fast , automatic fitting routines . in order to limit susceptibility to the lack of a tail in the gaussian approximation for uncertainties that follow a student s @xmath141 distribution",
    ", we artificially increased the errors on closure phases with the smallest errors .",
    "we did this by applying an error cutoff at 2/3 of the median closure - phase error . in the case of closure - phases with equal true errors , this means that we would have artificially increased the uncertainties on 12% of the closure triangles , changing the expected value of reduced @xmath37 from 1.4 to 1.24 for @xmath142 , making a smaller difference for large @xmath133 .",
    "in addition to the error calculated from a single run , we calculated closure - phase uncertainties from the dispersion amongst calibrator observations .",
    "we will denote these variances @xmath143 .",
    "where the error calculated from dispersion amongst the calibrators was greater than that given by the standard error of the mean for a single suns , we weighted the error estimates by :      after errors were increased by either the scatter amongst calibrators or the closure - phase uncertainty histogram cutoff , the covariance matrix was modified in such a way that the correlation matrix remained unchanged .    after finding the covariance matrix of calibrated closure - phase , we found that in general the errors in its calculation caused excessive noise in calculation of the covariance matrix inverse .",
    "for this reason , we first filtered the covariance matrix by fitting a model of the form :              here @xmath149 is the intrinsic phase variance of baseline @xmath48 , @xmath115 is a free parameter and @xmath150 and @xmath151 are closure - phase modes caused by skewness of the image in @xmath152 and @xmath153 directions .",
    "this skewness is caused by temporal effects , where in a single exposure , tip / tilt errors can be asymmetrical , with e.g. a single `` glitch '' where for 10% of the exposure the image is offset by 20mas .",
    "this can be a dominant error term at palomar , where the tip / tilt mirror is too large to have an adequate correction bandwidth in poor seeing .",
    "the @xmath10 in equation  [ eqncovcp ] is a @xmath154 if baseline @xmath48 is counted in the same direction for both closure - phases , and it is a @xmath155 if baseline @xmath48 is counted in opposite directions for both closure - phases .",
    "finally , in the fitting process , reduced @xmath37 was often greater than 1 .",
    "although by chance , this should have occured 50% of the time if uncertainties were correctly estimated , in practice it occured @xmath290% of the time . a possible reason for this could be residual systematics differences in sky position or color , despite the care taken to minimise these differences in a single observing block .",
    "when this occured , additional systematic closure - phase uncertainties were added so that reduced @xmath37 was 1 . for determining the confidence level of a null detection ,",
    "this reduced @xmath37 corresponds to the reduced @xmath37 for a single star fit , and for determining errors on a non - null detection , this reduced @xmath37 corresponds to that for the best binary fit .",
    "due to the linear dependence of model closure - phases , we calculate @xmath37 on a closure - phase vector space with dimensionality equal to the number of independent closure phases , @xmath156 .",
    "this vector space @xmath157 is formed by projection via a matrix @xmath158 , defined",
    "so that the covariance matrix on @xmath157 is a diagonal matrix @xmath159 :      this means that , given a closure phase vector @xmath161 , the covariance matrix of the linear combination @xmath162 is given by the diagonal matrix d. given model closure phases @xmath163 and data @xmath161 , the value of @xmath37 is then given by :      it is this @xmath37 that was minimised when fitting binary functions to closure - phase .",
    "the monte - carlo procedure was simplified computationally by limiting the fitting prodecure to the high - contrast regime , where closure - phase is a linear function of companion brightness .",
    "in this regime , model closure - phases @xmath163 were found for each separation and position angle for a fixed contrast ratio @xmath165 , with the fitted contrast ratio given by :      the matrix @xmath167 is a standard normal vector of length @xmath156 , multiplied by the standard errors as calculated in the vector space @xmath157 .",
    "this equation is relatively simple to derive my minimizing @xmath37 where the model closure phase at contrast @xmath27 is @xmath168 .",

    "we also thank the referee , ralph neuhuser , for providing a helpful critique .",
