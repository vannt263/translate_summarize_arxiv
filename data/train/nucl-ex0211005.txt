    "electromagnetic production of strange baryons has long been of interest because of the fact that such data can provide unique information about the flavor dependence of nucleon excited states , eventually leading to a better understanding of the theory of qcd .",
    "unfortunately , progress in understanding the production mechanism has been slow , in no small part because of the lack of high quality data . with the recent availability of a high quality , continuous electron beam at jefferson laboratory , precise new measurements are now achievable over a wide kinematic range  @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing information on the elementary production reaction , such data will also be a benchmark for future investigations of hyperon - nucleon interactions with nuclear targets .    in this paper , we present new cross section data on the reaction @xmath9 from jefferson lab experiment e93 - 018 , that were acquired at values of the square of four - momentum transfer , @xmath10 , between 0.5 and 2.0 ( gev / c)@xmath7 . at each value of @xmath10 ,",
    "cross sections were obtained at three different values of the virtual photon polarization @xmath8 , allowing a separation of the cross section into its longitudinal ( l ) and transverse ( t ) components .",
    "results for the @xmath3 channel were previously reported in ref .",
    "however , in order to provide an internally consistent comparison between the two reaction channels , we also present a reanalysis of the @xmath3 data . the differences between the two analyses will be discussed in detail in section  [ sec : mc ] : here we use a direct comparison of the experimental data to simulated yields in order to extract the cross section .",
    "the result is a significantly smaller longitudinal contribution and a weaker @xmath10 dependence than was previously reported . after a brief introduction and a detailed description of the experiment and analysis ,",
    "the data will be compared to isobaric models of meson electroproduction described below .",
    "exploratory measurements of kaon electroproduction were first carried out between 1972 and 1979  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the longitudinal and transverse contributions to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cross sections were separated for three values of @xmath10 .",
    "two values of @xmath8 were measured for each kinematic setting with relatively poor statistical precision , and the uncertainties in the l / t separated results were large . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the measurements were focused on pion electroproduction , but a sample of kaons was also acquired , from which cross sections were extracted .",
    "these measurements provided the first determination of the qualitative behavior of the kaon cross sections and were the basis for the development of modern models of kaon electroproduction .",
    "theoretical models all attempt to reproduce the available data from both kaon production and radiative kaon capture , while maintaining consistency with su(3 ) symmetry constraints on the coupling constants @xcite .",
    "the energy regime addressed by these models is low enough that they are formulated using meson - nucleon degrees of freedom .",
    "the most recent theoretical efforts can be divided into two categories , isobaric models and those that use regge trajectories .",
    "the approach taken in the isobaric models is to explicitly calculate kaon production amplitudes from tree - level ( _ i.e. _ , only one particle exchanged ) processes .",
    "a typical selection of diagrams considered is depicted in figure  [ fig : kdiagrams ] .",
    "for example , in david  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite , the authors sum over @xmath11-channel nucleon resonances up to and including spin  5/2 , @xmath12-channel hyperon resonances of spin  1/2 , and @xmath13-channel kaon resonances k@xmath14(892 ) and k1(1270 ) . in the wjc model",
    "@xcite , a different selection of @xmath11 and @xmath12 channel resonances is included ( both limited to spin 3/2 ) .",
    "mart  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite include the lowest lying @xmath15- and @xmath16-wave resonances , plus an additional resonance @xmath17 for which there appears to be evidence from kaon photoproduction  @xcite , although alternative interpretations of the data have been put forth in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the various isobaric models share the property that they initially include only spin  1/2 baryonic resonances ( although the specific resonances differ ) and determine the remaining coupling constants from performing phenomenological fits to the data .",
    "the coupling constants , which are the parameters of the theory , are not well - constrained due to the lack of available data .",
    "because of this , one sees differences in the various models for quantities such as @xmath18 .",
    "one issue that these differences reflect is that the various models disagree on the relative importance of the resonances entering the calculation .",
    "further details on the various isobaric models can be found in @xcite .",
    "-channel ( @xmath18 , etc ... ) are shown explicitly .",
    "note that the @xmath11-channel processes involving @xmath19 resonances are forbidden by isospin conservation for @xmath3 production.,width=316 ]    models based on regge trajectories  @xcite were developed in the early 1970 s to describe pion photoproduction data , of which there is a relative abundance .",
    "this approach has recently been revisited by vanderhaegen , guidal , and laget ( vgl ) @xcite . here , the standard single particle feynman propagator , @xmath20 , is replaced by a regge propagator that accounts for the exchange of a family of particles with the same internal quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "the extension of the photoproduction model to electroproduction is accomplished by multiplying the gauge invariant @xmath13-channel k and k@xmath14 diagrams by a form factor ( the isobaric models such as wjc also include electromagnetic form factors , however the functional forms used differ between models @xcite ) . for the vgl model",
    "this is given as a monopole form factor , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are mass scales that are essentially free parameters , but can be fixed to fit the high @xmath10 behavior of the separated electroproduction cross sections , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "for both the isobaric and regge approaches , precise experimental results for longitudinal / transverse separated cross sections are important for placing constraints on the free parameters within the models , hopefully giving insight into the reaction mechanisms .",
    "an additional motivation for performing measurements of l / t separated cross sections in kaon electroproduction is to determine the @xmath10 dependence of the k@xmath25 electromagnetic form factor .",
    "if it can be demonstrated that @xmath26 is dominated by photon absorption on a ground state kaon , the k@xmath25 form factor can be extracted through a measurement of the @xmath13-dependence of the longitudinal component of the cross section .",
    "this technique has been used to determine the @xmath27 electromagnetic form factor , including a recent new measurement  @xcite .",
    "while the kaon form factor may not be able to be extracted from the data presented here , it is the subject of other recently completed measurements at jefferson laboratory  @xcite .    finally , historically there has been interest in the ratio of @xmath28 transverse cross sections , which is linked to contribution of sea quarks to nucleon structure  @xcite . within the context of the parton model ,",
    "isospin arguments would lead one to expect the @xmath28 transverse cross section ratio at forward kaon cm angles to approach 0 with increasing bjorken @xmath29 if the kaon production mechanism is dominated by the photon interacting with single valence @xmath12 quark . when sea quarks are included in the nucleon s initial state , the approach to 0 is expected to be more rapid .",
    "measurement of of @xmath30 over a broad range of @xmath29 may provide information about the intrinsic @xmath31@xmath11 content of the proton .",
    "the elementary kaon electroproduction reaction studied here ,    @xmath1 + @xmath0 @xmath32 @xmath33 + @xmath34 + ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) ,    is shown in figure [ fig : peekdiag ] . an incident electron ( @xmath1 ) with lab energy @xmath35 , scatters by radiating a virtual photon ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the scattered electron ( @xmath33 ) travels at a polar angle @xmath37 in the laboratory frame with respect to the direction of the incident beam , defining the scattering plane .",
    "the virtual photon carries momentum @xmath38 and energy @xmath39 and interacts with a target proton to form a kaon ( k@xmath25 ) and a hyperon ( y , here either a @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) .",

    "the cross section is written in terms of the scattered electron energy , @xmath44 , electron lab frame solid angle , @xmath45 , and kaon center - of - momentum frame ( cm ) solid angle , @xmath46 as @xmath47 with @xmath48    here the cm frame is that of the ( virtual photon + proton ) system , and that the cm frame counterparts to lab variables will be denoted with an asterisk superscript . in this expression",

    "because the beam and target were unpolarized , and no outgoing polarization was measured , the virtual photoproduction cross section can be decomposed into four terms : @xmath54 where @xmath55  is the cross section due to transversely polarized virtual photons , @xmath56  is due to longitudinally polarized virtual photons , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are interference terms between two different polarization states .",
