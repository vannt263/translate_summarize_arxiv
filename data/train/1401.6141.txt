    "let us pause the calculation for a moment and understand the vanishing of the single point terms through the navier - stokes equation .",
    "we begin with the dissipation term , @xmath166 note that one needs to be careful when calculating @xmath167 ( or @xmath168 ) since the temporal and spatial derivatives do not commute . to avoid this complication we shall use the definition of the material derivative , @xmath169 : @xmath170 due to homogeneity and stationarity",
    "the first term in the rhs of ( [ disstime ] ) is equal to zero : @xmath171 next , the pressure term in ( [ dirdis ] ) can also be shown vanishing , using the incompressibility and homogeneity of the flow .",
    "thus , the final balance is @xmath172 where we expect only the first two terms in the right - hand - side not to have a well defined @xmath5 limit and thus that the cancelations of divergences are between them .",
    "the balance for the single - point pressure term is as follows : @xmath173 again , we can use the definition of the material derivative to write @xmath174 incompressibility and homogeneity tell us that the last two terms in the rhs of ( [ presd ] ) as well as the first term in ( [ presmat ] ) are zero .",
    "in addition , for the last term in the lhs of ( [ presmat ] ) we can write @xmath175 with the help of incompressibility and homogeneity .",
    "the cancellation is therefore seen explicitly @xmath176    after this brief diversion we return to the equation ( [ fullu2 ] ) .",
    "we now calculate the time derivatives of the two point correlation functions in this equation .",
    "this calculation is very similar to the one for single - point correlation functions we performed above .",
    "note that @xmath177 making use of homogeneity first and incompressibility second .",
    "also , @xmath178 where the second equality comes from homogeneity and parity invariance and the last one from stationarity .",
    "thus @xmath179 for the pressure term we have @xmath180 employing homogeneity and incompressibility in the last line .",
    "finally @xmath181 as discussed in the main text , all of the above terms are finite and , apart of the first two , vanish in the limit of @xmath5 : @xmath182 in a 2d incompressible flow one gets a similar result , assuming a white in time small - scale forcing , where only the first term is non vanishing .",
    "it is also possible to generalize the argument for the absence of divergences in the second time derivative of @xmath183 to all time derivatives of @xmath184 .",
    "this is made by induction , using [ me ] with the assumption of a stationary flow : @xmath185 then , if @xmath186 is finite @xmath187 is also finite .",
    "finally , it is clear that acting with @xmath131 on this average would not lead to divergences as it does not introduce factors of the dissipative scale .",
    "let us now compare our result for @xmath188 to that in the burgers equation .",
    "we can again use equation ( [ fullu2 ] ) with the pressure set to zero , and the additional forcing term coming from compressibility of the flow cancelling as well , due to the assumption of large scale forcing : @xmath189 so we can write , @xmath190 with the last terms coming from compressibility of the velocity .    at this point",
    "it is useful to restrict the calculation to the 1d flow , where one can manipulate derivatives more easily . in that case",
    "@xmath191 it is clear that the first two terms vanish in the inviscid limit as @xmath192 is finite in this limit .",
    "then , @xmath193 is also finite which means that @xmath194 is finite . on the other hand , @xmath195 so that @xmath5 @xmath196 in the inviscid limit .",
    "this is the term which is absent for incompressible flows and which blows up as @xmath5 .      in the previous work",
    "@xcite we have conjectured that generic turbulent systems must admit the family of the integrals of motion of the form @xmath197 here @xmath198 is the separation between particles at time @xmath73 , while @xmath199 is the separation at the initial time .",
    "the forced burgers equation is simple enough , so that it is possible to explore this conjecture here .",
    "we work with 1d burgers , marking particles in a pair such that @xmath200 for all pairs , implying also @xmath201 everywhere in our calculations .",
    "our main claims in @xcite were regarding the form of @xmath202 at large times and its role as a bridge between lagrangian dynamics and eulerian scaling of velocities . here",
    "we show that the link between the lagrangian and the eulerian objects for the burgers equation is a bit more subtle .",
    "indeed , two of the assumptions we used in our arguments for incompressible turbulence do not hold .",
    "the first one is that at large times most pairs of particles have separations @xmath203 . then , at such times , @xmath204 in the correlation function ( [ consrvd ] ) can be replaced by its asymptotic behaviour at infinity . on the contrary , for the burgers equation at asymptotically large times most pairs will have zero separation - they would have dived into a shock .",
    "the remaining pairs , those that contribute to the average , spread over a range of separations .",
    "the second assumption was that the initial separation @xmath199 is forgotten at large times .",
    "this is not the case for burgers , where the lagrangian moments of velocity depend on @xmath199 at all times .",
    "indeed , the contribution of pairs to the average , at any time , depends upon the presence of a shock between them , the probability for which scales like @xmath199 . thus here",
    "@xmath204 does not play the role of a link to the eulerian velocity scaling .",
    "this scaling is always provided by the presence of the shock .",
    "none the less , one can still speak of lagrangian conservation laws for the burgers equation .",
    "the idea is to balance the change in time of the velocity by using the function @xmath202 .",
    "we have already seen in the main text that there exist three qualitatively different time regimes for @xmath205 , each having it s own set of pairs that provide the main contribution to @xmath205 .",
    "let us briefly review what these are , including the dependence of their separations and velocities on the parameters in the problem .    * times @xmath206 : the pairs that contribute for such times are those with a shock between the particles .",
    "each pair has the velocity difference @xmath207 and the separation between particles equal to @xmath208 .",
    "the probability to have such a pair is @xmath209 .",
    "* times @xmath210 : pairs with a shock between particles , and thus velocity difference @xmath207 , have the separation between particles equal to @xmath211 .",
    "the number of such pairs per shock is @xmath212 .",
    "then , there are also pairs with one particle in the shock and one outside , which have @xmath213",
    ". particles in such pairs either used to be on the same side of the shock , in which case they have separations in the range @xmath214 , or , if they began on different sides of the shock , then @xmath215 .",
    "there are two pairs per shock for each such separation , the particle outside the shock being on one or the other side of the shock . + we can summarize these results by saying that in this time interval there is a probability of @xmath216 to have a pair of particles with velocity difference @xmath217 and separation in the range @xmath218 . with probability @xmath219",
    "a pair would have @xmath207 and separation @xmath211 .",
    "other pairs have negligible velocity differences and do not contribute ( [ consrvd ] ) . *",
    "times @xmath220 : only pairs with one particle inside the shock have a non negligible velocity difference between particles .",
    "that velocity difference is @xmath217 and the particle separation is in the range @xmath221 .",
    "the probability to have a pair of this type is @xmath216 .",
    "now , to compute @xmath222 at a specific time @xmath73 , all we need to do is to average over the separations and velocity differences of the pairs listed above , in the relevant time interval , using their respective probabilities .",
    "here we are interested in finding @xmath202 such that this average is time independent .",
    "first we notice that pairs have @xmath223 only backward in time .",
    "thus we can find @xmath224 for @xmath225 based purely on considerations for times @xmath206 . as the velocity difference is conserved backward in time ,",
    "it is enough to choose @xmath226 for @xmath225 so that in the range @xmath206 @xmath227 is time independent .",
    "the time range @xmath220 is also quite simple to treat . for these times",
    "@xmath228 which is manifestly time independent .",
    "this result , of course , has to match with that at @xmath2 ( or any other time ) , which occurs by construction from the demand of a conservation law at times @xmath210 , to which we turn next .        combining the backward with the forward in time results for the conservation law we find @xmath236 it is clear that since @xmath237 with ( [ fncon ] ) is time independent it will remain time independent also after the average over the shock parameters .",
    "we have thus found the following conservation law forward in time @xmath238 while backward in time the conservation law is the velocity itself @xmath239 .",
    "for example for @xmath53 , forward in time @xmath240 and for @xmath241 we have @xmath242 of course , all the calculations above are correct only in the inviscid limit , for @xmath243 in a stationary flow ."

    "<S> the symmetry is directly broken by cut - offs , introduced to regularize divergences in the measure . </S>",
    "<S> when the effect of the symmetry loss does not disappear as the cut - off is sent to zero or infinity , one calls it a quantum anomaly .    in turbulence , the viscosity @xmath7 provides an ultraviolet cut - off , explicitly violating time reversibility and energy conservation . </S>",

    "<S> however , in the inviscid limit ( infinite reynolds number @xmath8 ) the velocity becomes non - smooth and the dissipation rate @xmath9 has a non - zero limit equal to the energy flux through scales , @xmath10 , which is independent of the scale @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this is called a dissipative anomaly in turbulence , since energy conservation and time reversibility remain broken in the inviscid limit .    </S>",

    "<S> one can try to do so considering fluid particles . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , a non - smooth inviscid velocity field is non - lipshitz , implying that even in a given velocity field particle trajectories generally are not unique . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a measure corresponding to the possible trajectories should emerge somewhat analogous to the path integral in quantum field theory . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is called spontaneous stochasticity , it has been shown to lead to a dissipative anomaly for fields transported by the turbulent flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> non - uniqueness of trajectories seems to be a common attribute of anomalies in quantum field theory and in turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> of course , quantum non - uniqueness by itself does not provide an anomaly .    </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , in the ( lagrangian ) language of fluid particles moving according to @xmath19 , the anomaly was thought to be translated as follows @xcite : the rate of the relative velocity change for pairs of particles initially separated by a fixed distance is determined solely by the flux : @xmath20 up to now , that was the only known exact relation demonstrating a lagrangian velocity anomaly , valid both for incompressible navier - stokes and burgers equations . </S>",

    "<S> suggests that the squared velocity difference , averaged over pairs at the same distance , decreases with a rate dependent neither on distance nor on viscosity . to appreciate this result better , </S>",
    "<S> recall that it was also derived for an inverse energy cascade , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the lagrangian anomaly was perceived as bringing exactly the same information ( cascade rate and direction ) as the eulerian one . </S>",

    "<S> if the two limits do not commute , the relation ( [ a0 ] ) is a viscous effect ; reversing the order of limits should reveal an inviscid anomaly , if it exists .    </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely what happens in burgers where marker particles enter / leave shocks forward / backward in time during the viscous time scale . since particles experience a fast change in their energy only when entering / exiting shocks , the new lagrangian anomaly manifests itself in different rates of dissipation forward and backward in time . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the shocks are of zero measure in the limit @xmath21 , so that when we mark our lagrangian particles at @xmath2 , they all lie outside the shocks . as a result , there is no shock - related energy change backward in time .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , real fluid particles of weakly compressible flows , whose velocity @xmath26 is related to @xmath27 from burgers by @xmath28 , experience shocks moving past them with the speed of sound . </S>",
    "<S> they therefore do not deplete / accumulate in shocks and there is no jump in the lagrangian dissipation rate . </S>",
    "<S> still , the limits @xmath29 and @xmath30 do not commute , and when taken in the correct order the lagrangian anomaly disappears altogether .    </S>",
    "<S> below , we first present the analytic theory for burgers turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the two limits do not commute . when the order of limits is taken correctly , </S>",

    "<S> these results are summarized in figure  [ anomaly_figure ] .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we will present an argument why the limits @xmath5 and @xmath4 do commute for incompressible turbulence , leading to the survival of the familiar lagrangian anomaly . </S>",

    "<S> forward in time , conservation requires a power law for @xmath101 , @xmath102 with @xmath103 , see appendix for the details .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical origin of the discrepancy between the true lagrangian anomaly and ( [ lkm ] ) lies in the change of particle distribution inside the burgers shock . </S>",
    "<S> initially it is homogeneous , but is completely altered after a time of order @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> backward in time , the shock is depleted of particles causing a vanishing dissipation . forward in time , particles concentrate in the region of highest velocity gradient , where @xmath105 goes to zero at the largest rate , increasing the dissipation rate as compared with the homogeneous distribution . in the @xmath5 limit , </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of particles inside the shock is initially of measure zero and particles entering the shock lose @xmath105 instantaneously .    </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative picture described above did not rely on the properties of pairs of particles , thus we expect an anomaly of the same sort for single particles </S>",
    "<S> . for any time @xmath73 we can write @xmath106 eulerian moments are stationary and homogeneous so that forcing and dissipation cancel when taking first the limit @xmath107 and then @xmath5 : @xmath108 . in this case , the time derivative of the single - particle energy is zero . </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly , however , arises from the opposite order of limits . </S>",
    "<S> reversing the order affects the dissipation but not the forcing . </S>",
    "<S> forward in time , the energy loss is due to an inelastic collision between two particles with identical masses entering a shock from opposite sides . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity difference of the colliding particles is given by @xmath52 ( the shock height ) so that the energy lost in the process is @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> these collisions occur with the rate @xmath110 per shock . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the change in @xmath111 due to dissipation from shocks is @xmath112 , which is naturally one half of the dissipation ( [ dt1 ] ) found for @xmath113 at @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> combining dissipation with forcing one has @xmath115 for @xmath34 in the inviscid limit . at @xmath116 </S>",
    "<S> having a particle inside a shock at @xmath2 is of measure zero so that the dissipation term does nt contribute backward in time and , due to the forcing , @xmath117 for @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the forward in time dissipation was indeed observed for @xmath118 , in a numerical simulation of ( [ bur ] ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the relations ( [ dt1 ] ) and ( [ dt11 ] ) imply that the limits @xmath5 and @xmath4 can not be interchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this can also be deduced directly via a computation of @xmath119 for the viscous burgers equation , using the solution ( [ vel_eul ] ) for a stationary shock . </S>",
    "<S> one then discovers a temporal dependence of the form @xmath120 , i.e an essential singularity at @xmath116 from which the sensitivity to the order of limits arises . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a general lesson : if the limits are not interchangeable , we expect to find divergences in the next - order lagrangian time derivatives when taking @xmath4 before @xmath5 . indeed , using the burgers equation we find @xmath121 this relation and ( [ a0 ] ) are also true for particle pairs in a real compressible flow , implying that changing the order of the limits @xmath122 and @xmath5 must change the anomaly ( [ a0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as the fluid particles experience shocks running with the speed @xmath14 , it is of zero measure in the limit @xmath5 for a particle to be inside a shock , both backward and forward in time . </S>",
    "<S> the average pair velocity difference is therefore equal to the eulerian one at all times and the lagrangian anomaly ( [ a0 ] ) disappears . for finite @xmath37 , the distribution of the markers changes and stabilizes inside the shock during the time @xmath123 , so that in the interval @xmath124 , @xmath125 goes from zero to a finite value at @xmath2 and then returns to zero . </S>",
    "<S> note also the difference between lagrangian markers distributed uniformly at @xmath2 and the fluid density which is larger behind the shock .    * _ incompressible flows . </S>",
    "<S> _ * let us show that for incompressible stationary and homogeneous turbulence there is no anomaly change as described for compressible flows . for @xmath126 to jump </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath73 passes through zero , the second derivative @xmath127 must diverge at @xmath21 as in ( [ disspair ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this divergence appeared in burgers due to a product of velocity spatial derivatives at the same point , each extra derivative inside the eulerian correlation function bringing @xmath128 into the answer . </S>",
    "<S> to see that such a divergence is absent in an incompressible case , we follow @xcite and use @xmath129 : @xmath130 the first term in the rhs is zero by stationarity . in the last term , incompressibility allows us to take the @xmath131 operator outside of the correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> that gradient kills all the single - point terms because of spatial homogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , single - point moments are known to be time - independent for homogeneous , stationary and incompressible turbulence @xcite . as far as different - point terms </S>",
    "<S> are concerned , the same gradient @xmath131 acting on the ( finite ) correlation function brings @xmath132 rather than @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the time derivative of @xmath133 is finite at @xmath21 in an incompressible case . </S>",
    "<S> that demonstrates that @xmath126 does not have a jump at @xmath2 for any @xmath37 including @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> one can establish the full commutativity of limits by showing that the derivative with respect to @xmath37 is finite as well : @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> this insures that the lagrangian anomaly really is given by ( [ a0 ] ) for incompressible flows . </S>",
    "<S> the details of all the derivations can be found in the appendices .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the distribution of particles in incompressible flows is homogeneous at all times rather than accumulate in dissipative structures . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that for incompressible flows there is no new anomaly related to the short times it takes the particle concentration in such structures to change , like in burgers . in particular , this shows that although the burgers equation properly describes many physical situations it is not appropriate even for qualitative understanding of the lagrangian properties of incompressible turbulence .    coming back to the analogy with quantum anomalies , we mention the interpretation in terms of conflicting symmetries : a need to sacrifice one symmetry to save another . </S>",
    "<S> particles colliding in a shock can not conserve both energy and momentum , to conserve the latter they must loose the former ; similarly , to conserve electric charge one violates axial charge conservation . </S>",
    "<S> it would also be interesting to interpret the forward / backward in time anomalies as being due to trajectory uniqueness / non - uniqueness . </S>",
    "<S> two separate trajectories entering the same shock forward in time mean non - uniqueness and spontaneous stochasticity backward in time @xcite , resulting in the anomaly forward in time . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , two different trajectories can not meet backward in time , which leads to conservation . </S>",
    "<S> this conservation is rather unique for the burgers equation , where the velocity is a martingale backward in time @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to hypothesize that the symmetric anomaly for incompressible flows follows from the degree of non - uniqueness of trajectories being the same backward and forward in time . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , we have seen that trajectories clustering on zero - measure sets forward , but not backward , in time provide for an asymmetry in the anomaly .    </S>",
