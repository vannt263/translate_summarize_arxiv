    "there are many physical problems where the underlying partial differential equations have an interface . for example , second order elliptic equations with discontinuous coefficients are often used to model problems in material sciences and porous media when two or more distinct materials or media with different conductivities , densities or permeability are involved .",
    "the solution of these interface problems must satisfy interface jump conditions due to conservation laws .",
    "if the interface is smooth enough , then the solution of the interface problem is also smooth in individual regions where the coefficient is smooth , but due to the jump of the coefficient across the interface , the global regularity is usually low and the solution usually belongs to @xmath4 for some @xmath5 . because of the low global regularity , achieving accuracy is difficult with standard finite element methods , unless the elements fit with the interface of general shape .",
    "immersed interface method using uniform grids has many advantages over usual fitted grid method . using uniform grid",
    ", one does not need to generate a grid .",
    "this is quite convenient in several aspects .",
    "first of all , the structure of stiffness matrix is the same as that of the standard finite element method , where many known efficient solvers can be exploited .",
    "second , when a moving interface problem is involved one does not need to generate a new grid as time evolves . this saves considerable amount of time and storage .    the first attempt to avoid fitted grid for interface problem",
    "was made by leveque and z. li @xcite , where they proposed an immersed interface method for finite difference method where the jump condition was properly incorporated in the scheme .",
    "cartesian grids is most natural in this case .",
    "they subsequently applied the same idea to other interface problems such as the stokes flow problem , one - dimensional moving interface problem and hele - shaw flow , etc .",
    "@xcite the resulting linear systems from these methods are non - symmetric and indefinite even when the original problem is self - adjoint and uniformly elliptic .",
    "although these methods were demonstrated to be very effective , convergence analysis of related finite difference methods are extremely difficult and are still open .    for finite element methods , t. lin _ et .",
    "_ @xcite recently studied an immersed interface finite element method using uniform grids and they proved the approximation property of the finite element space of their scheme .",
    "their numerical examples demonstrated optimal orders of the error .",
    "other related works in this direction can be found in @xcite and references therein .    on the other hand , @xmath0-nonconforming finite element method introduced in @xcite for solving stokes equation is being widely used in solving elliptic equations and shown to be quite effective @xcite .",
    "especially , it is extremely useful in solving mixed finite element method by hybridization @xcite or finite volume formulation @xcite .",
    "the mixed finite element method based on the dual formulation is well - known @xcite .",
    "the motivation of mixed method is to obtain an accurate approximation of the flow variable and has been widely used in the study of flow in porous media such as petroleum engineering , underground water flow , and electrodynamics , etc .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) but this scheme leads to a saddle point problem for which many well known fast iterative methods fails . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "mixed hybrid methods have been introduced @xcite , where the problem reduces to a symmetric positive definite system in lagrange multiplier only .",
    "the flow and pressure variables are obtained via some post -processing .",
    "recently , there has been some development of the mixed finite element method in another direction : a mixed finite volume method was proposed in @xcite and extended in @xcite . in this method , one use raviart - thomas space and @xmath0-nonconforming space as trial spaces for velocity and pressure , and integrates the mixed system of equation on each volume .",
    "then one can eliminate velocity variable and obtain the equation of pressure variable only ( in terms of @xmath0-nonconforming fem ) directly from the formulation without using lagrange multiplier .",
    "the resulting linear system is again symmetric positive definite , and velocity can be recovered from pressure locally in a simple manner .",
    "the purpose of this paper is two - folded .",
    "first , we propose a finite element method on a uniform triangular grid using ` broken ' @xmath0-functions having degrees of freedom on edges .",
    "this is a galerkin type @xmath0-nonconforming finite element method with the basis functions having the average on edges as degrees of freedom , broken along the interface to match the flux condition .",
    "then we show optimal error estimates in @xmath6-norms . here , we emphasize that the meaning of ` nonconforming ' is different from the context of li et al .",
    "@xcite where the basis function has degrees of freedom at vertices , discontinuous along edges of interface elements",
    ". meanwhile , the basis function here are crouzeix - raviart type@xcite .",
    "hence it is discontinuous along all edges intrinsically .",
    "furthermore , since we use the average of linear function(possibly broken ) along edges as degrees of freedom , the overhead of dealing with nonconformity in the proof of error estimate is significantly reduced.(see section 3 ) next , we propose a mixed finite volume method using raviart - thomas space and the immersed interface finite element introduced above .",
    "this is similar to the scheme studied in @xcite , but the usual nonconforming basis function is replaced by a ` broken ' one on the interface element .",
    "we provide an optimal error analysis of pressure and velocity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will describe the model problem and some preliminaries .",
    "we construct an immersed interface @xmath0-nonconforming space with average degrees of freedom which preserves flux continuity weakly along the interface , and prove an interpolation error estimate . in sections",
