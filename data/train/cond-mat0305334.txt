    "many properties resulting from the coupling between nematic order and elastic deformations @xcite have been analyzed by m. warner , e. m. terentjev and coworkers @xcite .",
    "we are concerned here mainly by the transition from the nematic phase @xmath0 , to the high temperature phase @xmath1 .",
    "two striking facts should be mentioned here : ( a ) the transition is expected to be first order , but the plots of birefringence versus temperature @xmath6 are continuous .",
    "@xcite ( b ) the transition is very slow ( minutes ) .",
    "@xcite    our aim here is to discuss some effects of the nematic / elastic coupling on the phase transition .",
    "first , we discuss the anisotropy induced by the preparation method .",
    "we show that this preparation imposes a fixed _ external field _ coupled to the order parameter : under this field the plots of order versus temperature are expected to be continuous .",
    "second , we analyze @xmath6-jumps : for a cooling jump we find a traditional spinodal transition . but for a heating jump we show that the elastic couplings tend to suppress the spinodal instability .",
    "finally , we discuss the nucleation of an @xmath1 phase inside a nematic single crystal , and show that it should take place in the form of platelets , with well defined geometrical conditions .",
    "in the finkelmann scheme , a very weak network is prepared first , and is put under a prescribed deformation @xmath7 along one axis .",
    "@xcite then a second reaction is started and the final nematic rubber is generated .",
    "the basic energy for this situation is of the form@xmath8 where summation over the repeated indices is implied . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our attention to small deformations @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the standard landau free energy of the nematic order , @xmath11 describes the coupling between deformation and order , and the last term is the shear elastic energy ( we consider only incompressible systems : @xmath12 and @xmath9 are _ symmetric traceless tensors _ ) . the crucial point in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is that the elastic energy ( with a strong coefficient @xmath13 ) is minimal _ in the original state _",
    "( @xmath14 ) . we can shift the definition of deformations , writing@xmath15 where @xmath16 measures actual deformations from the high temperature @xmath1 phase .",

    "the @xmath72 mode is soft at all temperatures , if @xmath73 has full rotational invariance . but this mode can not cause a change in the magnitude of the order parameter and does not catalyze the transition .",

    "the magnitude of @xmath75 is fixed by the condition that the elastic energy of @xmath0 state be equal to the equilibrium value @xmath85 in the initial nematic phase . under the incompressibility condition , we have @xmath86 .",
