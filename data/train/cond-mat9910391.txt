    "since early fifties @xcite the physics of manganites challenge our current understanding of transition - metal oxides , and define both theoretical and experimental research problem that involves charge , spin , lattice and orbital degrees of freedom . recently in a modern systematic experimental studies a very rich phase diagram ( see , for example , ref . )",
    "depending on the doping concentration , temperature and pressure was obtained in the doped manganese oxides with perovskite structure @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is trivalent rare - earth and @xmath5 is divalent alkaline ion , respectively ) . at different doping concentration a full variety of magnetically ordered states such as antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator , ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal and charge ordered ( co ) insulator",
    "were observed .",
    "many efforts have been made by theoreticians to understand it based on various models and approaches . historically , double exchange ( de ) model@xcite was the basic one . in this model @xmath6-electrons",
    "are localized , whereas the @xmath7-electrons are mobile and use @xmath8 @xmath9-orbitals as a bridge between @xmath10 ions .",
    "the hopping of itinerant electrons together with a very strong on - site hund s coupling drives core spins to align parallel .",
    "qualitatively de model gave appropriate interpretation of the phase diagram at the doping range @xmath11 where fm metallic behavior was observed .",
    "one of the subtle aspects of the perovskite manganites is the charge ordered state observed in almost all such compounds at half - doping.@xcite a direct evidence of the co state in half - doped manganites has been provided by the electron diffraction for @xmath12.@xcite similar observations have also been reported for @xmath13 @xcite and in @xmath14.@xcite co state is characterized by an alternating @xmath15 and @xmath16 ions arrangement in @xmath17 plane with the charge stacking in @xmath18-direction . in co state",
    "these systems show an insulating behavior with a very peculiar form of afm spin ordering .",
    "the observed magnetic structure is a ce - type and consists of quasi one - dimensional ferromagnetic zig - zag chains coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "in addition , these systems show @xmath19/@xmath20 orbital ordering .",
    "another noteworthy observations were done by studying @xmath21 crystals with controlled one - electron bandwidth . as already mentioned above at half - doping @xmath22",
    "has a co ce - type insulating state .",
    "however , by substitution @xmath23 with @xmath24 leading to the increase of the carrier bandwidth , one induces the collapse of the co insulating state , and the a - type metallic state with @xmath25 orbital ordering is realized in @xmath13.@xcite the coexistence of the a - type spin ordered and ce - type spin / charge ordered states has been detected in the bilayer @xmath26 @xcite and three - dimensional @xmath27.@xcite these results indicate the competition between the metallic a - type @xmath25 orbital ordering and the insulating ce - type @xmath28 orbital ordering at half - doping and demonstrate the importance of the magnetic , charge and orbital order coupling in these compounds .    in recent publications it was shown that the de anisotropy resulted from the orbital degeneracy with the peculiar @xmath7 transfer amplitudes is important and to be a key point in explaining the various types of afm ordering.@xcite until now most of the theoretical studies of co state were done in the framework of the one - orbital model ignoring the double degeneracy of @xmath7 orbitals.@xcite the detailed mean - filed analysis of phase diagram of one - orbital de model in the presence of both on - site and inter - site coulomb terms has been given in ref .. it has been shown , that in the vicinity of half - doping the double - exchange gain of energy is considerably suppressed by the inter - site coulomb interaction that favors charge - ordered state .",
    "recently , the co state within the two - orbital model has been investigated by the projection perturbation techniques combined with the coherent state formalism and by monte carlo simulations in refs .   and , respectively . in ref .",
    "the origin of co has been attributed to the effective particle - hole interaction and co state with c - type of the spin ordering at @xmath29 has been obtained .",
    "the authors of ref . have shown that the experimentally observed charge , spin , and orbital ordering could be stabilized due to jahn - teller phonons .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the role of the orbital degeneracy in the co state based on the two - orbital de model including the intersite coulomb interaction .",
    "we adopt the mean - field ( mf ) approximation to derive the ground state phase diagram in the two - orbital model , and compare it to that of the corresponding one - orbital model .",
    "we argue that the orbital degeneracy together with the peculiar @xmath7 transfer amplitude has a drastic effect on the phase diagram and is important in obtaining the realistic magnetic / charge / orbital ordering observed in half - doped manganites .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section the model hamiltonian is presented and the mean - field scheme is formulated .",

    "the superexchange ( se ) interaction of localized spins between the nn sites is given by @xmath0 , @xmath1 represents the inter - site coulomb repulsion of @xmath31 electrons , @xmath39 is the particle number operator and @xmath40 is the chemical potential .",
    "the effect of the on - site coulomb interaction that is not included in our model hamiltonian will be discussed later .",
    "we study the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) within the mf approximation , which is set up by introducing the order parameter for static charge - density wave of the form @xmath41 , with @xmath42 being the electron density and @xmath43 .",
    "further , we treat localized spin subsystem classically and assume a strong hund s coupling @xmath44 . in this limit",
    "one may take the local spin quantization axis parallel to @xmath6-spins and in the rotated bases retain only `` spin - up '' components of the mobile electrons .",

    "we consider the following magnetic phases that competes : i ) ferromagnetic configuration ( f - type spin ordering ) with @xmath49 ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the angels between the neighboring spin in @xmath52-plane and @xmath18-direction , respectively , ii ) layer - type antiferromagnetic configuration ( a - type spin ordering )  the local spins are parallel in the planes and antiferromagnetically aligned between the neighboring planes , that corresponds to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "we need to compare the free energies of all possible magnetic configurations .",
    "in order to incorporate the role of orbital degeneracy , first we consider the one orbital model ignoring the double degeneracy of @xmath31 orbitals .",
    "retaining only the one orbital per mn - ion and assuming the isotropic transfer amplitude , the electronic part of the mf hamiltonian in @xmath64-space is written as : @xmath65 with @xmath66 the above hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) is easily diagonalized by the following canonical transformation : @xmath67 with @xmath68^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ; %   \\\\ \\\\ %                  { \\displaystyle v_{{\\bf k}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left [ 1+\\frac{\\tilde { t}_{\\bf k}}{\\varepsilon_{\\bf k } }    \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\nonumber\\\\ %                   { \\displaystyle \\varepsilon_{{\\bf k}}&=&\\sqrt{\\tilde{t}_{\\bf k}^2+\\delta^2 } \\ ; . % } %         \\end{array } % \\right . \\label{7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the @xmath69-operators , the one particle hamiltonian reads @xmath70 at half - filling the chemical potential lies inside the gap ( @xmath71 ) and recalling that @xmath59 we receive a self - consistent equation for the order parameter @xmath72    in fig.[f1 ] the overall behavior of the order parameter @xmath73 as a function of @xmath74 is presented for various magnetic configuration .",
    "since the wave vector summation in the right hand side of eq.([9 ] ) diverges in the limit @xmath75 there exist a nontrivial solution even at @xmath76 and hence a transition from homogeneous to co state is continuous",
    ". we also note that @xmath73 diminishes exponentially with increasing the bandwidth ( see fig.[f1 ] ) indicating that the transition between the homogeneous and the co state is a result of the competition between the kinetic and the electrostatic energy .    by comparing the free energies of different magnetic configuration we obtain the phase diagram as shown in fig.[f2 ] . at small @xmath1 , with increasing @xmath0 the system , starting from the f - co phase , first enters to the c - co phase and then to the g - co state .",
    "since the gain in the magnetic energy when the system moves from a- to c - phase is larger then the gain in the kinetic energy in c to a transition the a - co phase is absent in this part of phase diagram . with increasing of @xmath1 at @xmath77 the co gap in c -",
    "co phase overcomes that one in a - co phase that results in opening of small window of a - co phase in the phase digram .",
    "we also note that with increasing of @xmath1 the se coupling needed to stabilize the afm configuration decreases since the bandwidth effect is overshadowed when the gap becomes larger .",
    "the different magnetic structures in fig.[f2 ] are separated by the first - order boundaries .",
    "there is a jump in the charge order parameter across the phase boundaries , since the value of order parameter @xmath73 depends on the effective bandwidth and hence on the underlying magnetic structure , as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 .      to describe the effect of orbital degeneracy",
    ", we consider the mf hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) with anisotropic hopping amplitude . in the momentum space",
    "the electronic part of the hamiltonian reads as : @xmath78 d_{{\\bf k}\\alpha } ^{\\dagger}d_{{\\bf k}\\beta}- \\delta\\sum _ { { \\bf k},\\alpha}d_{{\\bf k},\\alpha}^{\\dagger } d_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q } , \\alpha } \\label{10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the diagonalization of this hamiltonian ( see appendix ) leads to the four band model . in the case of f- and a - type spin ordering and at the filling corresponding to one electron per two mn - ions ( half - doped case )",
    "the gap is not opened at the fermi surface , and the chemical potential moves down with the lower two bands .",
    "we solve the gap equation self - consistently with one for the chemical potential . as it seen in fig.[f3 ] , the transition to the charge ordered state is not continuous and there exists a critical value @xmath81 above which the ordered state is favorable ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 for f- and a - type spin ordering , respectively ) . as for the @xmath84-type spin ordering , there is no difference between the one and two orbital models in this sense .",
    "the existence of the additional orbital only introduce the localized level which is empty at the filling we consider .",
    "the above hamiltonian ( 10 ) describes the f- , a- , c- , and g - type spin ordering on an equal footing .",
    "however the presence of additional orbital degree of freedom , with the peculiar anisotropic transfer amplitudes @xmath85 [ see eq.([2 ] ) ] results in the anisotropic de interaction @xcite and may lead to the stabilization of ce spin ordering .",
    "let us consider one zig - zag with two ferromagnetic bonds alternated in @xmath86 and @xmath87 directions ( fig.[f4 ] ) .",
    "the corner and middle sites are denoted by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , and the unit cell is given by four nonequivalent atoms .",
    "+    for further discussions it is convenient to adopt the following bases of the @xmath31 orbitals at nonequivalent sites : @xcite @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 @xmath93 on @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 sites , respectively [ see , fig.[f4 ] ] . in the new bases",

    "diagonalization of the above hamiltonian ( see appendix ) leads to the complicated band structure consisting of bonding and antibonding bands , @xmath100 , and nonbonding states @xmath101 . due to the topology of the zig - zag structure ,",
    "only the directional @xmath102 orbitals at @xmath103 sites give the input in the low energy bonding state [ see appendix for a details ] .",
    "while for the @xmath104 sites both two orthogonal orbitals do contribute",
    ". therefore , the orbital degeneracy is removed on the middle site sublattice and the carriers on this sublattice will occupy the directional orbitals , leading to the polarized orbital state with @xmath28 orbital ordering .",
    "we also emphasize , that at half - doping the bonding band is full and the system is a band insulator even in the absence of the charge ordering .",
    "the onset of the charge ordering renormalizes the gap to higher value .",
    "the behavior of the charge order parameter is depicted in fig.3 .",
    "the transition to charge ordered state takes place at @xmath105 , that is lower then that one for a- and f- type spin ordering .",
    "a smaller value of intersite coulomb repulsion is needed to introduce the charge ordered state in the state with the lower dimension of ferromagnetic component .",
    "the ground state phase diagram of the two - orbital model is given in fig.5 .",
    "the phases with different magnetic structures are separated by the first - order boundaries ( soled lines in fig .",
    "the transition from the charge ",
    "disordered to the charge  ordered version of the given magnetic structure is continuous ,",
    "there is no jump in the charge order parameter during the transition which does not change the symmetry of underlying magnetic structure ( the corresponding second - order boundaries are denoted by the dashed lines in fig.5 ) . at small value of @xmath1 with increasing of se coupling",
    "the system goes through four magnetic phases f , a , ce , and g consequently .",
    "due to the additional orbital degree of freedom , unlike to the one orbital model , there exist a finite phase space of a - type spin ordering in the small @xmath1 region @xmath106 .",
    "however , for @xmath107 , when the charge ordering is introduced in the a phase , and hence the bandwidth effect is suppressed , ce - co phase wins and the a - co phase is never realized in the phase diagram of the present model .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the ground state phase diagram of the one- and two - orbital extended double exchange models within the mean filed approximation at half - doping . in the case of the one - orbital model",
    "the mf theory predicts the continuous phase transition to the charge ordered state due to the intersite coulomb interaction @xmath1 . in the two - orbital model",
    "the character of the transition is changed by the introducing the nonzero critical value of @xmath1 . while the transition to charge ordered state with given magnetic structure is continuous , there is jump in of charge order parameter across the phase boundaries between the states with different symmetry of magnetic structure .",
    "depending on the intersite coulomb interaction @xmath1 and and superexchange coupling @xmath0 different types of spin ordering ( f- , a- , g - type ) accompanied by the charge ordering may take place in the ground state of the one - orbital model . the presence of orbital degeneracy with the peculiar anisotropic @xmath7 transfer amplitude introduces the new magnetic state , ce - type spin ordering , in the phase diagram of the two - orbital model .",
    "the c - type spin ordering is never achieved within this model due to its instability against the effective `` dimerization '' and formation of the zig - zag ferromagnetic order .",
    "the alternation of the ferromagnetic bonds in @xmath108 directions leads to the alternation of the hopping amplitude . as a result",
    "the bare band is splited into bonding and antibonding states and the `` dimerization '' gap opens on the fermi surface at half - doping .",
    "the ce - type spin ordered state is accompanied with @xmath28 orbital ordering , originated from the topology of the zig - zag structure .",
    "the ce - type spin / charge state also wins the co state with a - type afm ordering and there exists the phase boundary between the ce spin / charge ordered state and charge disordered ( cd ) a - type state [ see fig.5 ] .",
    "the experimentally detected competition between a - cd and ce - co states in the half - doped manganites could indicate that the parameters of the system are close to this phase boundary .",
    "therefore the small change of the bandwidth may drive the system from one to other state .",
    "that is also suggested by the huge oxygen isotope effect observed in la - pr compounds .",
    "@xcite a substitution of @xmath109 by the isotope @xmath110 narrows the carrier bandwidth due to the polaronic effect and as a result the electrostatic energy might overcome the kinetic energy and the charge ordered insulating state might be established .",
    "we would like to point out that there exist other physical factors and ingredients not included in present treatment that may stabilize the particular state and modify the phase diagram ( quantum nature of the spins , coupling to the jan - teller phonons , and on site coulomb interaction ) . as it was recently discussed in ref .",
    "the interorbital on - site coulomb interaction @xmath111 could be responsible for the experimentally observed charge ordered state . in the ce structure",
    "the orbital degeneracy is removed on the sublattice composed by the middle sites and the low energy state corresponds to the directional orbitals ( see appendix of the present paper ) .",
    "if charge carriers occupy the corner sites there will be a positive contribution from the @xmath111 term to the system energy . while , if only middle site sublattice is occupied this positive contribution disappears since the onsite coulomb term has the zero matrix element in this case .",
    "therefore , @xmath111 term in ce - type spin ordered state acts as a source of the charge ordering , but in a rather deferent way then the intersite coulomb repulsion .",
    "since the middle sites are stacked in @xmath18-direction @xmath111 induces experimentally observed @xmath112 charge ordering instead of the wigner crystal type co favored by the intersite coulomb interaction considered here . nevertheless , we believe that the main effect of the orbital degeneracy on the interplay of different type of magnetic ordering in charge - ordered state is at least qualitatively captured by the present treatment indicating the crucial importance of the electronic state degeneracy on the phase diagram .    financial support by the the intas program , grants no 97 - 0963 and no 97 - 11066 , are acknowledged .",
    "diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ 10 ] ) can be done by two subsequent canonical transformation .",
    "first , we diagonalize the free part of the hamiltonian by introducing the new fermionic operators @xmath113 with @xmath114 one finds the effective hamiltonian of the form @xmath115 .",

    "<S> a rich phase diagram is obtained in the mean - filed theory at zero temperature as a function of @xmath0 ( antiferromagnetic ( afm ) superexchange interaction ) and @xmath1 ( intersite coulomb repulsion ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the one - orbital model a charge - ordered ( co ) state appears at any value of @xmath1 with different types of magnetic order which changes with increasing @xmath0 from ferromagnetic ( f ) to afm ones of the types a , c and g . </S>",
