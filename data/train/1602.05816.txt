    "simple , two component models ( e.g. diskbb+powerlaw ) did not provide an acceptable fit to the 0.778 kev spectrum , and it is evident that in this particular low , soft accretion state , swift j1753.5 - 0127 does not exhibit a classical soft state spectrum . alhough it is not clear how such a steep power law component is produced , physically , this phenomenon is not unique to swift j1753.5 - 0127 .",

    "swift_-xrt observations shows that the source has indeed reached its softest state ever observed , with the hr dropping to @xmath30.20.3 , compared with @xmath30.4 during the failed state transitions studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ to investigate the broadband luminosity of the soft state of swift j1753.5 - 0127 , we estimate the unabsorbed flux ( 0.1100 kev ) to be 3.5@xmath4410@xmath45 erg @xmath46 s@xmath31 . it must be noted that this calculation is highly sensitive to @xmath47 and is thus only an estimate , due to the uncertainty of the spectral shape outside the 0.778 kev range of the observed spectrum . nevertheless , the chosen energy range is most representative of that required to calculate the intrinsic luminosity of the source .",
    "the distance , @xmath48 to the source is not known and there are a wide range of estimates @xcite .",
    "we adopt here the upper limits of @xmath48=2.83.7 kpc ( assuming a 5@xmath49 bh and binary inclination @xmath50 ) calculated by @xcite from fitting accretion disk models to the uv spectrum of the source . assuming a fiducial value of @xmath48=3 kpc we therefore estimate the luminosity to be 3.8@xmath4410@xmath51erg s@xmath31 , which , for a 5@xmath49 bh is 0.60% of the eddington limit . for larger bh masses",
    ", this value decreases .",
    "soft - to - hard state transitions have been seen to occur in lmxbs at luminosities between 0.3% and 3% eddington @xcite , though very rarely at the lower end of this range .",
    "swift j1753.5 - 0127 has therefore likely been observed to be in one of the lowest luminosity soft states recorded in bh systems , third only to those observed in 4u 1630 - 47 @xcite and the microquasar xte j1720 - 318 @xcite .",
    "+ however , to make comparisons with the aforementioned sources , we must estimate the luminosity from the same energy range . for 4u 1630 - 47",
    ", an eddington fraction was calculated from the 210 kev luminosity to be @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mass of the bh in units of 10 @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "we estimate the unabsorbed luminosity of swift j1753.5 - 0127 ( 210 kev ) to be @xmath54 erg s@xmath31 or @xmath55 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude higher than 4u 1630 - 47 , though it is still a very low transition luminosity . in the case of xte j1720 - 318 ,",
    "@xcite utilised the 3200 kev flux to estimate an eddington fraction of @xmath56 during the soft state .",
    "we estimate @xmath57 for swift j1753.5 - 0127 in this range .",
    "this is an order of magnitude lower than xte j1720 - 318 .",
    "+ so far we have seen several cases of unusual soft spectral states at very low luminosities in different sources , of which swift j1753.5 - 0127 is now the best - studied example .",
    "although all these states show soft spectra , they are not like standard disk blackbodies , instead showing very steep but power - law - like tails .",
    "this suggests the possibility that at such low luminosities the disk can persist but its spectrum is modified by strong compton scattering by plasma with a temperature not much higher than the disk itself , i.e. there is a significant disk ` atmosphere . '",
    "this in turn may suggest that disks at such low accretion rates are at the borderline of evaporating , perhaps to form the standard hard state corona ( e.g. via the mechanisms described by @xcite ) , yet somehow they are able to persist at low luminosities relatively stably in this borderline disk / corona state , compared to disks following the usual soft - hard transition .",
    "we can also use the fitting parameters from the ( simpl*diskbb)+powerlaw model to estimate the inner radius @xmath58 of the accretion disk of swift j1753.5 - 0127 .",
    "the model normalisation @xmath59 is related to the inner radius as follows :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the spectral hardening factor ( see @xcite and equation 1 of @xcite ) and @xmath62 is the distance to the source in units of 10 kpc . for a distance of 3 kpc ,",
    "@xmath10 ( calculated from x - ray spectral analysis of the source in the hard state ; @xcite ) , @xmath63 and @xmath9 ( a typical value ; @xcite ) we find @xmath64 , though this decreases with increasing @xmath65 and increases for larger distances .",
    "previous studies of the source in the hard state find a heavily truncated disk with @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that @xcite used a lower inclination ( @xmath67 ) , utilising this value in our calculation of @xmath58 would only decrease the value by @xmath68 .",
    "+ we can separately estimate @xmath58 by considering the friction free boundary condition @xcite . from this condition",
    ", the inner radius can be calculated as follows :    @xmath69    using the same values as above , we calculate @xmath70 km , which for a @xmath5 bh is @xmath71 .",
    "+ regardless of the boundary condition we choose , in the soft state of swift j1753.5 - 0127 the inner edge of the disk appears to have moved closer to the bh . in the case of this source ,",
    "it has not entered a typical soft state , in which the mass accretion rate will reach large eddington values ( @xmath72 ) , consistent with the disk having not yet reached the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "however , @xmath58 is significantly closer to the bh than that in the hard state .",
    "+ it is interesting to compare our value of @xmath58 with that of @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath73 to be an order of magnitude larger in the soft state than @xcite during one of the failed state transitions .",
    "this implies that the disk was closer to the bh ( @xmath74 for identical parameters as above ) during the short - lived intermediate state , which correlates with the higher disk temperature seen at this time .",
    "the lmxb swift j1753.5 - 0127 transitioned to a low luminosity soft state in march 2015 , previously unseen in this source , after @xmath310 yrs in the hard state .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is dominated by a soft accretion disk component and a hard power - law tail , though we find that a simple two component model does not constrain the data well and find that a third component is required .",
    "our best fit model describes the spectrum with a multi - temperature disk with @xmath75 kev which is scattered into a steep power law ( @xmath76 ) , plus an additional , hard ( @xmath77 ) power law tail .",
    "we discuss the possibility that the softer , steep power law component could be caused by the irradiation of the inner disk by the compton tail , but we find that the parameters are unphysical and the fit can be equally well replicated by including an additional multi - temperature disk component in place of the irradiated disk .",
    "we find that there is no evidence for fe emission at 6.4 kev ( a 90% confidence upper limit equivalent width of @xmath78 ev ) , nor for a reflection component in our best fit model .",
