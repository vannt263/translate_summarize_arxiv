    "the disk - to - star accretion rate is one of the most important parameters driving the evolution of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "however , it is difficult to directly measure the mass accretion rate , for which indirect empirical methods are necessary to estimate it .",

    "they are being used to quickly estimate accretion rates .",
    "the l@xmath0l@xmath1 empirical correlations have been derived using samples of pms stars by comparing their accretion luminosities , mostly obtained from the uv excess and line veiling , with the emission line luminosity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "currently , dozens of near - uv  optical  near - ir spectral lines have been found to correlate with l@xmath0 for classical t tauri ( tt ) stars ( for instance , the hydrogen balmer and paschen series , hei , oi , naid and caii transitions ,",
    "br@xmath3 ... etc ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* al14 hereafter ) .",
    "the correlations of the accretion luminosity with several of these lines have been extended both to the sub - stellar and the intermediate - mass herbig ae / be ( haebe ) regimes @xcite .",
    "apart from the observational effort involved to look for additional emission lines that could serve as accretion tracers , several investigations aim to provide physical links between some of the spectral transitions and the accretion process , which would explain the origin of the l@xmath0l@xmath1 correlations . in a nutshell , either the lines are directly tracing the accreting region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the correlation with forbidden lines like [ oi ] ( 6300 @xmath4 ) exhibited by haebes @xcite is more difficult to explain , as this line is not identified with accretion / winds but rather with the surface layers of the circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "a further challenge to the various explanations of the origin of the l@xmath0l@xmath1 correlations is that the variations in the accretion rate as measured from the uv excess do not generally correlate with the observed changes in the line luminosities @xcite .",
    "however , time delays between different physical processes could be present @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the accretion luminosity is also found to correlate with the luminosity of the central star ( l@xmath2 ) .",
    "the l@xmath0l@xmath2 correlation extends over @xmath5 10 orders of magnitude in l@xmath0 , and @xmath5 7 orders of magnitude in l@xmath2 , covering all optically visible young stars from the sub - stellar to the haebe regime ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , we aim to show that all ( near - uv , optical and near - ir ) l@xmath0l@xmath1 correlations in pms stars are driven by the relationship between the stellar luminosity and the accretion luminosity , and that therefore the accretion luminosity necessarily correlates with the luminosity of all spectral lines regardless of their physical origin . section [ sect : lacc - lstar ] introduces and partially re - analyses the l@xmath0l@xmath2 correlation in pms stars .",
