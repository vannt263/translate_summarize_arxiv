    "understanding the structure of the @xmath0 is a long - standing issue in hadron physics .",
    "the nominal location of the @xmath0 mass , 27 mev below the @xmath11 threshold , deviates prominently from the expected naive quark model pattern and indicates a more complex structure .",
    "following early work by dalitz _",
    "more than half a century ago  @xcite , the @xmath0 began to be considered as a quasi - bound @xmath10 state embedded in the @xmath6 continuum .",
    "motivated by such a picture , phenomenological @xmath10 potential models were designed to reproduce the @xmath0 mass together with two - body scattering data  @xcite .",
    "a more systematic framework emerged with developments of meson - baryon effective field theory based on the spontaneous breaking of chiral @xmath12 symmetry in low - energy qcd . in this theory",
    "the kaon is part of the pseudoscalar octet of nambu - goldstone bosons , but with an important explicit chiral symmetry breaking term introduced by its mass , @xmath13 gev , that reflects the relatively large mass of the strange quark , @xmath14 gev . over the years , chiral @xmath4 dynamics ,",
    "as the synthesis of chiral effective field theory and coupled channels methods  @xcite , has turned out to be a highly successful approach to deal with @xmath10 interactions and the @xmath0 .",
    "even though the phenomenological and the chiral su(3 ) @xmath10 interactions produce comparable results at and above @xmath10 threshold , they differ significantly in their extrapolations to subthreshold energies  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological @xmath10 interactions are constructed to describe the @xmath0 as a single pole of the scattering amplitude around 1405  mev , corresponding to a quasi - bound state of the @xmath10 system with a binding energy of about 30  mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath10-@xmath6 coupled - channels amplitude resulting from chiral su(3 ) dynamics has two poles , one of which is located around 1420 mev  @xcite while the other pole represents a broad structure above the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "the pole at 1420 ( rather than 1405 ) mev corresponds to a @xmath10 quasi - bound system with a binding energy of 15  mev , about half the binding produced with the purely phenomenological @xmath10 potentials .",
    "these differences in the pole structures come from different off - shell properties .",
    "the @xmath10 interaction based on chiral su(3 ) dynamics is necessarily energy - dependent : the nambu - goldstone boson nature of the @xmath15 dictates that the leading - order @xmath10 @xmath16-wave interaction is proportional to the time derivative of the antikaon field and thus varies linearly with the @xmath15 energy .",
    "consequently , as one extrapolates deeper into the subthreshold region , the attraction generated by this interaction becomes progressively weaker than the one proposed by the energy - independent phenomenological potentials . at the same time",
    ", corresponding differences occur in the strong @xmath17 channel couplings .",
    "hence the @xmath10 binding energies predicted by interactions based on chiral @xmath4 dynamics are systematically smaller than those suggested by the phenomenological models .",
    "these differences are further enhanced in the so - called few - body kaonic nuclei , such as the strange dibaryon resonance under discussion in the @xmath1-@xmath2 coupled system  @xcite .",
    "how a possible signature of this strange dibaryon resonance shows up in a suitable production reaction is of great interest as it reflects the two - body dynamics in the @xmath0 channel  @xcite .",
    "exploring the structure of the @xmath0 requires a precise determination of the @xmath10-@xmath6 interaction .",
    "the data base available to constrain these interactions includes the old @xmath11 scattering cross sections  @xcite , the @xmath10 threshold branching ratios  @xcite , and the kaonic hydrogen measurements  @xcite with special emphasis on more recent accurate siddharta data  @xcite .",
    "these latter data strongly constrain the @xmath10 input , as shown by the systematic study of chiral su(3 ) dynamics using next - to - leading order driving interactions  @xcite . the experimental data just mentioned are collected at and above the @xmath10 threshold . since @xmath6 elastic scattering can not be performed",
    ", the subthreshold energy region is only accessible by measuring mass spectra of decay products in reactions producing the @xmath0 .",
    "the relevant @xmath6 spectra have recently been measured in photoproduction reactions by the leps collaboration at spring-8  @xcite and by the clas collaboration at jlab  @xcite , and in @xmath18 collisions by the hades collaboration at gsi  @xcite . the importance of accurately determined @xmath6 spectra as constraints for the subthreshold @xmath10 interaction has also been emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "yet another process of prime interest is the @xmath19 reaction .",
    "it was studied long ago by braun @xmath20",
    "@xcite in a bubble - chamber experiment at @xmath21 momenta between 686 and 844 mev .",
    "a new experiment is ongoing at j - parc ( e31  @xcite ) with a 1 gev @xmath22 beam   process at lower energy has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . for theoretical studies with this kinematics ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite . ] . in the e31 experiment ,",
    "the @xmath6 production cross sections will be measured separately for all combinations of charges , i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "it is therefore important to establish a theoretical framework for a detailed analysis of this reaction .",
    "theoretical investigations of @xmath26 with comparable kinematics have previously been performed in simplified models assuming a two - step process@xcite . to extract the information of the subthreshold @xmath10 interaction from the experimental spectrum , an improved framework for the reaction mechanism is called for .    in this work",
    "a full three - body calculation of the @xmath1-@xmath2 amplitude is performed employing the coupled - channels alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) equations .",
    "we investigate how the @xmath0 resonance manifests itself in the differential cross section of the @xmath27 reaction . at j - parc",
    "it is planned to observe the @xmath0 in the @xmath6 mass spectrum measured by detecting the forward kicked - out neutron  @xcite .",
    "our calculation focuses on this observable .",
    "one of the aims is to study the role of different off - shell properties of the underlying interactions as they are realized in chiral @xmath4 dynamics versus phenomenological potential models .",
    "we thus employ two different types of @xmath10-@xmath6 interactions , i.e. , energy - dependent ( e - dep . ) and energy - independent ( e - indep . ) , and examine how the different off - shell properties of these interactions show up in the three - body dynamics .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : three - body ] , we introduce the ags equations for the three - body @xmath1-@xmath2 system and derive the cross section for the @xmath7 reaction .",
    "the two - body interactions used in this work are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : two - body ] .",
    "the numerically computed differential cross sections are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] .",
    "a summary follows in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we begin by constructing the three - body amplitudes relevant to the @xmath7 reaction . throughout this paper",
    "it is assumed that the three - body processes take place via separable two - body interactions given by the following forms in the two - body center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a vertex ( cutoff ) factor of the two - body channel @xmath30 with relative momentum @xmath31 and isospin @xmath32 .",
    "the interaction matrix @xmath33 is a function of the total energy @xmath34 in the two - body system . in the three - body system , we define the two - body energy as @xmath35 with the three - body energy @xmath36 and the spectator particle energy @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the relative momentum of the spectator particle @xmath39 .",
    "the explicit forms of the relevant two - body interactions are presented in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : two - body ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while the primary focus in this study is on the @xmath10 subthreshold region and the two - body @xmath10-@xmath40 dynamics governing the @xmath0 formation in the @xmath1 three - body system , it is also instructive to explore @xmath6 invariant mass spectra above @xmath10 threshold in @xmath41 .",
    "in fact our calculation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cross_above ] ) yields pronounced structures , especially for the charged channels ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , in the angle - integrated differential cross section . these structures are qualitatively different in the e - dep . and e - indep .",
    "approaches .",
    "the @xmath44 double differential cross section with the neutron emitted in forward direction is of special interest ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cross_above_0 ] ) .",
    "our three - body calculations predict a strongly developed maximum around @xmath45  gev for both the e - dep . and the e - indep .",
    "models , a feature that should be well observable .",
    "a less pronounced effect is seen in the @xmath46 channel which requires both charge exchange and strangeness exchange mechanisms .",
    "the appearance of the prominent maximum in @xmath47 around @xmath45  gev can be traced to a combination of subtle three - body mechanisms in the coupled @xmath48-@xmath49 system : the nucleon exchange process between the incident @xmath22 and the deuteron , with a propagating @xmath10 pair and a spectator nucleon , and subsequent @xmath15 exchange leading to the final @xmath6 and neutron .",
    "the momentum matching between these two basic processes in the three - body system produces the pronounced enhancement in the @xmath50 channel about 20  mev above @xmath10 threshold .",
    "the appearance of such a structure in @xmath47 raises of course the question of model dependence and sensitivity to cutoff variations in the two - body amplitudes .",
    "this cutoff dependence turns out indeed to be stronger in the three - body system with its off - shell dynamics , as compared to the two - body subsystems . in order to examine this issue ,",
    "we have performed calculations of the @xmath7 differential cross sections using the acceptable range of cutoff scales at the two - body vertices discussed previously and listed in table  [ cutoff_eb ] .",
    "this leads to the theoretical uncertainty bands displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_eb ] for @xmath51 and in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_forward_eb ] for the double differential cross section with forward - emitted neutron , both taken at an incident @xmath22 momentum @xmath52  gev .",
    "in particular , we have examined the influence of using the optimized cross section for @xmath53 while maintaining the other cross sections well reproduced within uncertainties ( compare the solid and dashed curves in figs .  [",
    "fig : cross_eb ] and [ fig : cross_forward_eb ] ) .",
    "while the absolute magnitudes of the differential cross sections are indeed subject to uncertainties , the structural patterns of the forward double differential cross sections for @xmath43 and @xmath42 final states remains quite stable with respect to cutoff variations , with the exception of the neutral ( @xmath25 ) combination for which no prediction is possible .    at the same time as this genuine three - body dynamical structure in the @xmath54 final state appears around @xmath55  mev , it is quite remarkable that @xmath47 with forward neutrons does not display a @xmath0 signal any more ( whereas it is still visible in the angle - integrated @xmath51 for @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of interferences of three - body mechanisms in @xmath57 and @xmath58 amplitudes which screen the @xmath10 pole contribution .",
    "within the framework of the coupled - channels ags equations , we have investigated how the signature of the @xmath0 appears in differential cross sections of @xmath59 reactions .",
    "two types of meson - baryon interactions , the e - dep . and e - indep .",
    "models , have been considered to illustrate how the difference of the subthreshold behaviors translates into the @xmath60 spectra .",
    "the e - dep .",
    "approach is generally favored because of its foundation in chiral su(3 ) effective field theory .",
    "characteristic structures reflecting the formation and dynamics of the @xmath0 in the @xmath1-@xmath49 three - body system are found in differential cross section as a function of the @xmath6 invariant mass . by comparison of results using e - dep . and e - indep .",
    "models , it may be possible to discriminate between these two approaches , especially in comparison with separately measured @xmath43 and @xmath42 invariant mass spectra . of particular interest in this context",
    "are double differential cross sections with detection of the emitted neutron in forward directions , to be measured in a forthcoming experiment at j - parc .",
    "detailed final state channel dependence originates from the interference of @xmath57 and @xmath58 components of the final @xmath6 states , providing important information not only on the @xmath57 but also the @xmath58 @xmath10-@xmath6 interactions .",
    "three - body dynamics in the coupled @xmath48-@xmath49 system is predicted to generate a pronounced maximum in the @xmath61 double - differential cross section with a forward - emitted neutron at a @xmath6 invariant mass @xmath62  gev .",
    "further detailed studies exploring this structure are under way .",
