    "@xmath0ta is the only nucleus present in nature in an isomeric state ( @xmath1 ) at an energy of 75.3 kev .",
    "its solar abundance is very small ( 2.48 , normalized to @xmath2 for si ) , thus presenting a challenge for different nucleosynthesis models ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of proposed production scenarios )",
    ".    in the s - process site thermal photons may excite higher - lying states in @xmath0ta which then decay back either to the @xmath3 ground state or to the @xmath4 isomer . to find these mediating states ( ms ) belic _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the stuttgart dynamitron facility with both enriched ( @xmath5 ) and natural ta targets .",
    "irradiations were performed for bremsstrahlung endpoint energies @xmath6@xmath7 mev .",
    "depopulation of the isomer was observed down to @xmath8 mev .",
    "this means that the lowest ms may have an excitation energy @xmath9 mev ( above the ground state ) .",
    "the experimental total integrated depopulation cross section @xmath10 then turns out to be @xmath11 ev @xmath12 .",
    "higher lying mediating states ( below 2 mev ) were found at @xmath13 mev ( @xmath14 ev @xmath12 ) , 1.51 mev ( @xmath15 ev @xmath12 ) , 1.63 mev ( @xmath16 ev @xmath12 ) , and 1.93 mev ( @xmath17 ev @xmath12 ) .",
    "the structure , spin and parity of the ms remain unknown , calculations in the framework of the two - quasiparticle - plus - phonon model ( tqpm ) @xcite failed to reproduce their energies as well as @xmath10 s ( ms found for @xmath18 mev ) .",
    "for a theoretical description of @xmath0ta we use the standard axially symmetric rotor model including coriolis mixing @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic degrees of freedom are described in the framework of the tqpm @xcite .",
    "the model hamiltonian is given by a deformed axially symmetric average field ( nilsson potential with parameters from @xcite ) , monopole pairing interaction ( proton and neutron gaps from @xcite ) and a long - range residual multipole - multipole interaction : @xmath19 the strength constants , @xmath20 , are fitted to experimental energies of the @xmath21vibrational states of the even - even core or taken from systematics .",
    "the model hamiltonian is treated in the bcs approximation .",
    "one - phonon even - even core excitations are obtained using the standard rpa @xcite .",
    "all terms of the two quasiparticle interaction in the model hamiltonian corresponding to the neutron - proton multipole - multipole interaction are replaced by a diagonal gaussian force with central , spin - spin , majorana and majorana spin - spin components with parameters from @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic model wave - functions are composed of one - neutron - quasiparticle plus one - proton - quasiparticle and one - neutron - quasiparticle plus one - proton - quasiparticle plus phonon components : @xmath22 where the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are determined using the variational principle .",
    "in the model , vibrational admixtures in neutron - proton wave functions can be calculated .",
    "taking into account the coriolis mixing ( without any attenuation ) enables us to predict possible transitions between the ground state and the isomer .",
    "recently , we improved our calculations @xcite .",
    "the model space comprises now 260 lowest intrinsic two - quasiparticle states with one - phonon components and corresponding rotational bands . for the calculation of electromagnetic transitions ( and branching ratios of the @xmath0ta levels to the ground state and the isomer ) ,",
    "@xmath25e1@xmath26 and @xmath27e1@xmath28 , @xmath25e2@xmath29 and @xmath27e2@xmath30 , @xmath25e3@xmath29 and @xmath27e3@xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 were used .",
    "theoretical energies were replaced by known experimental energies @xcite and internal conversion was taken into account .        1 .",
    "there are no ms at low energies ( below 600 kev ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ tasp ] where theoretical energies vs. intrinsic spin projection @xmath33 and parity are plotted .",
    "2 .   the total experimental transition rate @xmath34 for the process isomer @xmath35 ms @xmath35 ground state  can be calculated from @xmath36 and compared with the theoretical transition rate @xmath37 ^ 2 }   \\cdot \\left(\\frac{e_{ms}-75.3\\mbox { kev}}{\\hbar c}\\right)^{2l+1 } \\cdot   b_{eff}(xl ) \\ , \\ ] ] where we sum over the relevant multipolarities e1 , e2 , and m1 .",
    "@xmath38 is the effective reduced transition probability for the process isomer @xmath35 ms @xmath35 ground state . in fig .",
    "[ wtot ] the summed @xmath34 and @xmath39 are compared .",
    "the main trend is reproduced but we still fail to account for 1 or 2 orders of magnitude .      in our theoretical calculations using the tqpm and the standard axially - symmetric rotor model including coriolis mixing low - lying mediating states were found for the first time .",
    "the lowest mediating state lies at 670 kev , but the transition rate from the isomer to the ground state is very small ( see fig .",
    "[ wtot ] ) . a larger increase of the transition rate was found in the region around 1.2 mev near the lowest experimentally observed mediating state .",
