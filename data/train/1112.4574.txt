    "this paper is devoted to the study of two equivalent dynamical systems of the grigorchuk group @xmath0 , the action on the space of the marked schreier graphs and the action on the space of subgroups .",
    "the main object of study is going to be the set of the marked schreier graphs of the standard action of the group on the boundary of the binary rooted tree and their limit points in the space of all marked schreier graphs of @xmath0 .    given a finitely generated group @xmath1 with a fixed generating set @xmath2 , to each action of @xmath1 we associate its schreier graph , which is a combinatorial object that encodes some information about orbits of the action .",
    "the marked schreier graphs of various actions form a topological space @xmath3 and there is a natural action of @xmath1 on this space .",
    "any action of @xmath1 corresponds to an invariant set in @xmath3 and any action with an invariant measure gives rise to an invariant measure on @xmath3 .",
    "the latter allows to define the notion of a random schreier graph , which is closely related to the notion of a random subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "a principal problem is to determine how much information about the original action can be learned from the schreier graphs .",
    "the worst case here is a free action , for which nothing beyond its freeness can be recovered .",
    "vershik @xcite introduced the notion of a totally nonfree action .",
    "this is an action such that all points have distinct stabilizers . in this case",
    "the information about the original action can be recovered almost completely .",
    "further extensive development of these ideas was done by grigorchuk @xcite .",
    "the grigorchuk group was introduced in @xcite as a simple example of a finitely generated infinite torsion group .",
    "later it was revealed that this group has intermediate growth and a number of other remarkable properties ( see the survey @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we are going to use the branching property of the grigorchuk group , which implies that its action on the boundary of the binary rooted tree is totally nonfree in a very strong sense .    ]",
    "the main results of the paper are summarized in the following two theorems .",
    "the first theorem contains a detailed description of the invariant set of the schreier graphs .",
    "the second theorem is concerned with the dynamics of the group action restricted to that invariant set .",
    "[ main1 ] let @xmath4 be the mapping that assigns to any point on the boundary of the binary rooted tree the marked schreier graph of its orbit under the action of the grigorchuk group .",
    "then    * @xmath5 is injective ; * @xmath5 is measurable ; it is continuous everywhere except for a countable set , the orbit of the point @xmath6 ; * the schreier graph @xmath7 is an isolated point in the closure of @xmath8 ; the other isolated points are graphs obtained by varying the marked vertex of @xmath7 ; * the closure of the set @xmath8 differs from @xmath8 in countably many points ; these are obtained from three graphs @xmath9 choosing the marked vertex arbitrarily ; * as an unmarked graph , @xmath7 is a double quotient of each @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) ; also , there exists a graph @xmath12 such that each @xmath10 is a double quotient of @xmath12 .",
    "[ main2 ] using notation of the previous theorem , let @xmath13 be the set of non - isolated points of the closure of @xmath8 .",
    "then    * @xmath13 is a minimal invariant set for the action of the grigorchuk group @xmath0 on @xmath14 ; * the action of @xmath0 on @xmath13 is a continuous extension of the action on the boundary of the binary rooted tree ; the extension is one - to - one everywhere except for a countable set , where it is three - to - one ; * there exists a unique borel probability measure @xmath15 on @xmath14 invariant under the action of @xmath0 and supported on the set @xmath13 ; * the action of @xmath0 on @xmath13 with the invariant measure @xmath15 is isomorphic to the action of @xmath0 on @xmath16 with the uniform measure .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we define a map @xmath843 as follows . given @xmath844 and @xmath845 , let @xmath846 be an infinite word obtained from @xmath781 after replacing the first @xmath847 letters by the first @xmath847 letters of @xmath554 and adding @xmath848 to the @xmath849-th letter .",
    "clearly , @xmath850 .",
    "let @xmath851 be the remainder of @xmath839 under division by @xmath734 .",
    "one can check that the restriction of @xmath852 to the vertex set of the closed ball @xmath853 is an isomorphism of this ball with the closed ball @xmath854 whenever @xmath855 .",
    "therefore @xmath856 as @xmath463 .",
    "one consequence of lemma [ grig8 ] is that the graphs @xmath828 , @xmath829 , and @xmath830 are schreier graphs of the group @xmath0 . by construction ,",
    "each of these graphs admits a nontrivial automorphism , which interchanges vertices corresponding to the same vertex of @xmath814 .",
    "this property distinguishes @xmath828 , @xmath829 , and @xmath830 from the schreier graphs of orbits of the action @xmath547 .",
    "it follows from proposition [ sch4 ] and lemma [ grig4 ] that marked schreier graphs @xmath810 and @xmath858 are isomorphic only if @xmath859 .",
    "therefore the schreier graphs @xmath857 , @xmath555 admit no nontrivial automorphisms .",
    "the graphs @xmath828 , @xmath829 , and @xmath830 have linear structure .",
    "namely , one can label their vertices by @xmath860 , @xmath861 so that each @xmath860 is adjacent only to @xmath862 and @xmath863 .",
    "if @xmath39 is an automorphism of such a graph , then either @xmath864 for some @xmath865 and all @xmath861 or @xmath866 for some @xmath865 and all @xmath861 .",
    "assume that some @xmath10 has more than one nontrivial automorphism .",
    "then we can choose @xmath39 above so that the latter option holds with @xmath867 .",
    "take any path in @xmath10 that begins at @xmath54 and ends at @xmath55 and let @xmath244 be the code word of that path . since @xmath868 and @xmath869 for any integer @xmath536 , the path in @xmath10 with beginning @xmath870 and code word @xmath244 ends at @xmath871 .",
    "it follows that for any integer @xmath872 the path with beginning @xmath54 and code word @xmath873 ends at @xmath870 .",
    "in particular , this path is not closed .",
    "however every element of the grigorchuk group @xmath0 is of finite order ( see @xcite ) so that for some @xmath872 the reversed word @xmath873 equals @xmath645 when regarded as a product in @xmath0 .",
    "this conradicts with proposition [ sch1 ] .",
    "thus the graph @xmath10 admits only one nontrivial automorphism .",

    "the schreier coset graph of the subgroup @xmath775 is shown in figure [ fig4 ] . in view of lemmas [ grig6 ] and [ grig9 ] ,",
    "the automorphism group of this graph is the klein @xmath647-group .",

    "theorem [ main1 ] we are concerned with the mapping @xmath806 given by @xmath875 .",
    "let us also consider a mapping @xmath876 given by @xmath877 and a mapping @xmath878 given by @xmath879 . by proposition [ sch4 ] , @xmath880 for all @xmath555 . by proposition [ sub5 ]",
    ", @xmath39 is a homeomorphism .",

    "it is borel measurable due to lemma [ sub4 ] . also , @xmath881 is continuous at a point @xmath555 if and only if @xmath556 .",
    "lemmas [ grig5 ] and [ grig6 ] imply that the latter condition fails only if the infinite word @xmath554 contains only finitely many zeros .",
    "according to lemma [ grig2 ] , an equivalent condition is that @xmath554 is in the orbit of @xmath805 under the action @xmath547 . since the mapping @xmath5 is @xmath39 postcomposed with a homeomorphism , it is also injective , borel measurable , and continuous everywhere except the orbit of @xmath783 .    by lemma [ grig7 ] ,",
    "the graph @xmath7 is an isolated point of the image @xmath8 .",
    "since @xmath882 for any @xmath555 and @xmath683 and since the action @xmath269 is continuous ( see proposition [ sch2 ] ) , the graph @xmath883 is an isolated point of @xmath8 for all @xmath683 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath555 is not in the orbit of @xmath783 , then the graph @xmath810 is not an isolated point of @xmath8 as the mapping @xmath5 is injective and continuous at @xmath554 .",
    "it follows from lemma [ grig9 ] that the image @xmath8 and the orbits @xmath884 , @xmath834 are disjoint sets .",
    "note that the orbit @xmath884 consists of marked graphs obtained from the graph @xmath10 by marking an arbitrary vertex .",
    "lemma [ grig8 ] implies the union of those @xmath647 sets is the closure of @xmath8 .",
    "theorem [ main2 ] lemma [ tree5 ] combined with lemma [ grig4 ] implies that the action of @xmath0 on the closure of @xmath8 is a continuous extension of the action @xmath547 .",
    "the extension is one - to - one everywhere except for the orbit @xmath804 where it is four - to - one .",
    "namely , for any @xmath683 the point @xmath885 is covered by @xmath647 graphs @xmath883 , @xmath886 , @xmath887 , and @xmath886 . according to theorem [ main1 ] ,",
    "the graph @xmath883 is an isolated point of the closure of @xmath8 .",
    "when we restrict our attention to the set @xmath13 of non - isolated points of the closure , we still have a continuous extension of the action @xmath547 , but it is three - to - one on the orbit @xmath804 .",
    "by lemma [ grig2 ] , the group @xmath0 acts transitively on each level of the binary rooted tree @xmath508 .",
    "then proposition [ tree1 ] implies that the action @xmath547 is minimal and uniquely ergodic , the only invariant borel probability measure being the uniform measure on @xmath16 .",
    "since the action of @xmath0 on the set @xmath13 is a continuous extension of the action @xmath547 that is one - to - one except for a countable set and since this action has no finite orbits , it follows that the action is minimal , uniquely ergodic , and isomorphic to @xmath547 as the action with an invariant measure .",
