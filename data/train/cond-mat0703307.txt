    "there are many examples in which very deep grooves form at the intersections of grain boundaries and the surface in systems in which a liquid metal is in contact with a polycrystalline solid . in some systems , such as al - ga , zn - ga , cu - bi and ni - bi",
    ", the liquid film quickly penetrates deep into the solid along the grain boundary and leads to brittle intergranular fracture under the influence of even modest stresses .",
    "this is a form of liquid metal embrittlement ( lme ) .",
    "although this phenomenon is quite common in material processing , lme is not well understood .",
    "lme is particularly important in nuclear reactor scenarios in which liquid metals are used as coolants and as spallation targets .",
    "the al - ga couple is a particularly well - known lme system .",
    "several studies have shown that the maximum load a polycrystalline al sample in contact with liquid ga can sustain decreases as the quantity of ga on the grain boundaries increases ( characterized by exposure time of these al samples to ga ) eventually leading to intergranular brittle fracture .",
    "@xcite transmission electron microscopy  @xcite ( tem ) , scanning electron microscopy  @xcite ( sem ) , and synchrotron radiation micro - radiography studies  @xcite all show that liquid ga penetrates into grain boundaries in al at a remarkable rate , leading to a distinct channel morphology .",
    "the penetration of liquid ga along the grain boundaries produces wetting layers with thickness ranging from several monolayers  @xcite to several hundred nanometers ,  @xcite even in the absence of an applied load .",
    "interestingly , the rate of propagation of such liquid layers is strongly influenced by even very small stresses .",
    "@xcite based on these observations , the embrittlement of al by liquid ga is considered to be associated with the fast penetration of liquid gallium , resulting in rapid changes in grain boundary structure / bonding and in many properties of the polycrystal ( e.g. , fracture strength ) .",
    "@xcite    thermodynamically , wetting of a grain boundary by a liquid metal should be expected when the spreading coefficients @xmath1 satisfies : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the free energies of the grain boundary and solid - liquid interface , respectively .",
    "@xcite however , thermodynamic arguments do not explain the liquid channel morphology , the ga penetration kinetics , or the atomistic mechanism of ga penetration .",
    "the anomalously fast , time - independent penetration rate ( several @xmath5 m/s at room temperature  @xcite ) of very long nanometer - thick liquid films can not be explained in terms of the classical mullins grain boundary grooving  @xcite nor by normal grain boundary diffusion .",
    "@xcite    various models have been proposed to explain the kinetics and atomistic mechanisms by which the liquid phase penetrates quickly along grain boundaries , including corrosive dissolution ,  @xcite mixed diffusion - dissolution ,  @xcite self indentation - internal solution ,  @xcite coherency stresses ,  @xcite amorphous grain boundary / liquid transformation ,  @xcite and others .",
    "@xcite however , even for the well - known al - ga lme couple case , many fundamental questions remain .",
    "for example , the degree to which ga penetration along grain boundaries occurs in the complete absence of internal or external stresses is still unsettled .",
    "furthermore , the role of stress on grain boundary penetration is not well understood .",
    "further issues include whether lme is essentially `` replacement - like '' ( ga atoms replace al atoms at the grain boundary and the al atoms are transported away ) or `` invasion - like ''  @xcite ( ga atoms insert into the grain boundary without replacing al atoms ) .",
    "the latter process must generate stresses , which could be relieved by plastic deformation as the liquid layer thickens .",
    "clearly , the mechanisms by which grain boundary penetration occurs remain unsettled .",
    "the penetration of a liquid phase along grain boundaries is a complex phenomenon , involving several different types of simultaneous processes ; e.g. , dissolution / reprecipitation , liquid groove formation , grain boundary diffusion , and grain boundary segregation . because of the interplay between the underlying phenomena that occur in lme",
    ", it has been difficult to design experiments that can be easily interpreted to understand which processes control the phenomena and which are simply parasitic .",
    "we approach lme by performing molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of an al bicrystal in contact with liquid ga ( with and without an applied stress ) .",
    "the advantage of a simulation approach is that it is much easier to interrogate both microscopic and macroscopic events that occur during lme with a resolution rarely accessible to experiments ( ngstroms and picoseconds ) . as a first step , we tune a set of embedded - atom method ( eam ) potentials to reproduce the experimental solid - liquid al - ga binary phase diagram .",
    "we investigate how ga penetrates along the grain boundaries , the degree to which al dissolves into the liquid ga , the relative displacement of the grains , the stress distribution within the solid , and physical parameters that are useful for interpreting the penetration mechanism ( e.g. , grain boundary diffusivity , segregation of ga to the grain boundary , elastic constants ) .",
    "based on these simulation results , we propose a new mechanism for lme and compare it with general trends gleaned from a series of experimental studies in the literature . a brief report on this topic , focused upon different grain boundaries ,",
    "was reported in ref .  .",
    "a first step in the simulation of lme in the al - ga system is the development of a reasonable description of the atomic interactions . while several potentials have been developed for elemental al ( ref .   and one for ga ( ref .  ) , we are unaware of the development of potentials that were optimized to reproduce the properties of the binary al - ga system .",
    "the al potentials listed here are of the eam form , while the ga potential is a modified embedded - atom method ( meam ) potential ( that includes angular terms )  @xcite .",
    "while the meam ga potential reproduces many of the properties of ga , we focus here on the computationally more efficient eam class of potential for both al and ga . to this end , we develop al - ga eam potentials of the eam type originally developed by mei and davenport  @xcite for al .",

    "this is likely associated with ga atoms being inserted into the grain boundary to reduce the tensile stresses there .",
    "the largest atomic displacements observed within the grains adjacent to where ga has thoroughly penetrated the nearby grain boundary .",

    "[ fig : stressfield](c ) .",

    "we performed a series of md simulations of an al bicrystal in contact with liquid ga and examined the penetration of ga along the al grain boundaries in the presence and absence of an applied stress . even though the present simulations were relatively large , both in terms of the number of atoms modelled and simulation time , our atomistic simulation approach to lme , nonetheless , has some limitations .",
    "for example , the simulations were only able to describe the first @xmath51 ns of the lme process and the extent of the liquid metal penetration was limited to @xmath123 nm .",
    "this should be compared with many experiments in which thin ( nanometer - thick ) liquid films penetrate up to several hundred micrometers over time scales ranging from seconds to hours .",
    "because of these limitations , the stresses applied in the present simulation had to be much larger than those applied in experiment in order to observe lme .",
    "the relatively small size of our simulation cells also precluded observations of significant plastic deformation ( dislocation nucleation in small volumes is difficult and there were no pre - existing dislocations ) , even though plastic deformation would occur in macroscopic samples at this stress level .",
    "however , the fact that significant plastic deformation does not occur during our simulations was fortuitous since experiments show that lme occurs in al - ga at stresses which are too small to cause macroscopic deformation of the al .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations can complement continuum models and experiments .",
    "first , simulations can provide an atomic scale view of the dynamics of the system , grain boundary structure , and stresses and composition near the advancing liquid film layer front .",
    "such fundamental , high resolution data are rarely accessible in experiments : for example , although the synchrotron radiation x - ray microradiography  @xcite is very useful for _ in - situ _ observation of sub - micrometer ga wetting layers , the very early stages of the wetting process involves a ga layers that are only a few monolayers thick and are not visible with this technique ( typically , a layer thickness of at least @xmath124 nm is required for detection ) .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations provide a unique tool for understanding which materials properties are important in lme and for identifying which processes are rate - controlling .",
    "this is accomplished by careful design of idealized set of rigidly maintained conditions to emphasize certain effects and exclude competing factors which may influence the lme .",
    "while no interatomic potential is perfect , the eam potentials for the al - ga alloys were shown to successfully reproduce many of the important solid - liquid properties in this alloy system . to complement the known behavior of these potentials",
    ", we also performed an analysis of several other properties of this system that may affect lme , including grain boundary diffusivity and the tendency for ga grain boundary segregation .",
    "this gave us the ability to exclude certain models for lme from further consideration .",
    "our simulation results may be directly compared with many experimental observations in the literature .",
    "this is , in part , associated with the fact that al - ga is one of the most widely experimentally studied lme systems ( both polycrystals and bicrystals ) . among these , the recent series of tem studies by @xcite ,  @xcite and synchrotron radiation micro - radiography studies by ludwig and pereiro - lopez _ et al . _",
    "@xcite are of particular interest because they are both quantitative and provide microscopic observations .",
    "although these experimental techniques are very different , both studies report a consistent set of features .    although the time and length scales of the simulations and experiments differ , we demonstrated that our simulations were able to capture many of the experimentally observed trends in liquid ga penetration of grain boundaries in al .",
    "experiments showed that the application of tensile stresses ( as small as a few mpa ) to an al polycrystal sample , drastically increased the liquid metal penetration rate .",
    "@xcite recent synchrotron radiation x - ray micro - radiographic experiments  @xcite showed that the penetration behavior of liquid ga along two different types of symmetrical tilt bicrystals of al was greatly facilitated by the application of a tensile stress of only @xmath124 mpa .",
    "our simulations also showed that an applied stress significantly increases the rate of liquid metal penetration , although the applied stress level used in the simulations was approximately 100 times larger than that used in the experimental studies ( @xmath125 versus @xmath124 mpa ) .",
    "as in the macroscopic experiments ,  @xcite the simulations demonstrated that the penetration rate and thickness of the ga - rich layer increases with increasing grain size  @xcite ( under fixed grip conditions ) . since grain sizes in most real materials are much larger than those used in the simulations ( @xmath126 mm versus @xmath127 nm , a factor of @xmath128 ) , the difference in the magnitude of the applied stress necessary to facilitate the penetration rate in the simulations is understandable .",
    "it is clear that , even in the absence of an applied stress , many experimental samples may be subject to residual stresses resulting from sample fabrication , processing , polishing , or gripping .",
    "ludwig and pereiro - lopez _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that residual stress , introduced by sample preparation , can affect liquid metal penetration rates in both al bicrystals and polycrystals . in their experiment , susceptibility to grain boundary penetration",
    "was strongly influenced by the method in which the sample was gripped .",
    "two different gripping procedures were used in their experiments : `` gently screwing '' together between metal plates and `` gluing '' the al sample to cu supports using silver paint .",
    "the screwed samples exhibited larger liquid film propagation and thickening rates , as well as a larger probability that specific grain boundaries ( in al bicrystals ) could be penetrated at all .",
    "although the magnitude of these effects was not accurately quantified , the sensitivity of grain boundary penetration to gripping methods suggests that the detailed loading state ( e.g. , fixed stress or fixed strain ) may play an important role in liquid film penetration .",
    "this is consistent with the discussion of the simulation results presented above .    in many experiments",
    ", ga penetrates into al bicrystals as a thin layer that lengthened at nearly a fixed rate ,  @xcite whereas in experiments in polycrystalline al , the rate of propagation was more jerky and irregular .",
    "@xcite commonly , the penetration rate is higher in polycrystals than in bicrystals presumably because of higher residual stresses and more degrees of freedom for the relative motion of individual grains .",
    "@xcite the penetration rate was also observed to be very sensitive to grain boundary crystallography . _ in - situ _ synchrotron observations of high energy @xmath129 $ ] tilt boundaries by ludwig _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed the ga penetration rate was nearly constant with a velocity @xmath130-@xmath131 m/s . _ in - situ _ tem observations of several al bicrystal foils by @xcite  @xcite also showed a nearly constant ga penetration rate , @xmath132-@xmath133 m/s , depending on the grain boundary crystallography .",
    "these two experiments were performed under nominally similar conditions . in our simulations , we found that the ga penetration rate was also nearly constant , albeit with a velocity of 0.1 - 0.2 m / s which is significantly larger than experimentally observed in al bicrystals .",
    "the discrepancy is likely attributable to the fact that our simulation was performed at relatively high temperature ( @xmath58 k ) and with relatively large stresses ( to overcome the time scale limitations of md simulations ) .",
    "the _ in - situ _ experiments were performed at room temperature with a stress of several mpa , while the simulations were performed at 600 k with a stress of at least 250 mpa .",
    "another possible reason for the faster penetration rates in the simulations as compared with the experiments is that the minimum observable ga layer thickness in the simulations was @xmath134 nm versus at least @xmath124 nm in experiments .    in the present simulations",
    ", we observed that the separation between the pair of grains that meet at a grain boundary ( measured using markers that were some distance from the grain boundary ) increased as the ga - rich layer propagated down the grain boundary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gbseparation ] ) .",
    "a similar analysis was also performed in a series of experiments by ludwig _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite where the distance between two grains in al bicrystals was measured by image correlation techniques .",
    "they observed an increase of separation between the points by tens of nanometers during penetration even without an applied stress ( but possibly subject to residual stresses ) .",
    "although the time and length scales are somewhat different , these observations agree well with our simulation results .",
    "the discrepancy between the magnitudes of the relative displacements ( by two orders of magnitude ) can be explained by the same stress and grain size effects described above . both the simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gbseparation ] ) and experiments  @xcite show that the measured ga layer thickness @xmath116 is nearly zero until a time well beyond the time at which significant grain displacement was observed to begin .",
    "this suggests that the grain boundary opening below the liquid film tip is the results of the bond stretching associated with the stress field of the advancing ga penetration front .",
    "@xcite  @xcite observed generation of a moving strain field at the ga penetration front using tem .",
    "they proposed that the penetration front acts as a line defect with a singular strain field .",
    "our simulations also revealed that the moving ga penetration front was accompanied by a dislocation with its own unique singular stress pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stressfield ] ) .",
    "this dislocation seems to precede the advancing and thickening ga penetration layer .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the absence of an applied strain , no dislocation forms [ fig .",
    "[ fig : stressfield](a ) ] and the ga penetration rate decreases with time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : penetrationrate ] ) .",
    "however , when a strain is applied , dislocations form and climb at a fixed rate [ fig .",
    "[ fig : stressfield](b ) and ( c ) ] and the ga penetration rate is time independent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : penetrationrate ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the constant ga penetration rate observed in the strained solid is associated with the fixed rate of `` climb '' of dislocations . here",
    ", the applied strain plays essential roles in ga penetration : to aid the nucleation of dislocations at the grain boundary and to keep the grain boundary open to allow fast ga transport enough to move with the dislocations .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that application of a stress significantly promotes liquid metal penetration , resulting in a change from a diffusive to fixed rate penetration mode .",
    "the change of penetration kinetics is attributed to the nucleation and constant - rate climbing of grain boundary dislocations .",
    "why do the dislocations move down the boundary ?",
    "the dislocation sets up its own stress field ; in the present geometry , it is compressive above the dislocation line and tensile below .",
    "the chemical potential along the grain boundary is proportional to the grain - boundary traction  @xcite or @xmath93 and , hence , the chemical potential along the grain boundary changes abruptly at the dislocation .",
    "ga atoms in the grain boundary respond by jumping quickly from above the dislocation line to below it .",
    "this , in turn , moves the dislocation down , yet preserves the stress discontinuity ( i.e. , the dislocation is intact ) .",
    "this explains why the dislocation climbs down at a fixed rate .",
    "how fast does the dislocation climb ?",
    "this can be determined by solving the coupled elasticity / diffusion problem .",
    "similar problems were addressed by chuang  @xcite and gao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in the context of diffusive crack or wedge growth along a grain boundary subjected to an applied stress .",
    "@xcite the steady - state dislocation climb velocity @xmath135 in this model can be approximated as  @xcite @xmath136 where @xmath31 is the atomic volume of the species with grain boundary diffusivity @xmath137 , @xmath138 is the thermal energy , @xmath104 is the burgers vector , @xmath109 is the young s modulus , and @xmath110 is poisson s ratio .",
    "@xmath139 is a characteristic length associated with the jump in stress across the dislocation and should be of order of the dislocation core size ( i.e. , a few  ) and can be found by solving the singular coupled elasticity / diffusion problem .",
    "@xcite using values for ga in al in eq .",
    "( [ eq : climbvelocity ] ) yields @xmath140 m / s , which is consistent with the dislocation climb velocity in the present simulations .    the following model for the embrittlement of al by ga emerges .",
    "first , ga diffuses down the grain boundary in al below the liquid groove root and , if the quantity of the inserted ga is sufficiently large , a dislocation is nucleated at the grain boundary with the aid of the applied stress .",
    "the dislocation establishes its own stress field ; in the present geometry ; it is compressive above the dislocation and tensile below it .",
    "the first dislocation climbs down by stress - enhanced ga hoping across the dislocation core , leaving a tail of ga behind ) .",
    "this ga hopping leads to a constant dislocation climb rate that is independent of the remote applied stress .",
    "once the dislocation moves far enough from the groove root , another dislocation is nucleated .",
    "it too climbs down the grain boundary at the same rate , resulting in a uniform spacing of climbing dislocations .",
    "each dislocation further relaxes the applied stress until it reaches a level too small for further dislocation nucleation . at this point , however , the stress is not fully relieved .",
    "this residual stress is further relaxed by ga diffusion down the boundary .",
    "since ga weakens the al bonds at the grain boundary ,  @xcite this ga penetration leads to boundary decohesion , grain boundary opening , and crack formation / propagation ( i.e. , lme cracking ) .",
