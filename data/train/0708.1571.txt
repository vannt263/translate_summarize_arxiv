    "in this paper by _ form _ we mean a binary quadratic form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are integers and @xmath3 runs on the integers plane lattice .",
    "the integer number @xmath4 is called the _ discriminant _ of the form ( [ form ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we call a form _ elliptic _ if @xmath5 , _ hyperbolic _ if @xmath6 and _ parabolic _ if @xmath7 .    according to the usual terminology",
    ", the elliptic forms are said _ definite _ and , and _",
    "indefinite _ the hyperbolic ones .",
    "the problem of classifying and counting the orbits of binary quadratic forms under the action of @xmath8 on the @xmath3-plane dates back to gauss and lagrange ( @xcite,@xcite ) and was recently re - proposed by arnold in @xcite .",
    "the description of the orbits of the positive definite forms by means of the action of the modular group on the poincar model of the lobachevsky disc is well known : in this model , there is a special tiling of the disc such that every tile is in one - to - one correspondence with an element of the group , namely , the element that sends the fundamental domain to it . the upper sheet of the two - sheeted hyperboloid where the coefficients of positive definite forms lie is represented by the lobachevsky disc , so that every class of forms has one and only one representative in each domain .",
    "the complement to the plane of the lobachevsky disc , representing the hyperbolic forms , is not tiled by the same net of lines ( for instance , the straight lines of the klein model , separating the domains of the lobachevsky disc ) into domains of finite area .    in this article",
    "i show , however , that it is possible to introduce a special partition into separate domains of the one sheeted hyperboloid where the coefficients of the forms lie : in each of such domains every orbit has a finite  well defined  number of points .",
    "the situation is , however , intrinsically different from that of the lobachevsky disc , where there is no distinguished fundamental domain , i.e. , all domains of the partition are equivalent . in our partition of the de sitter world _",
    "there are two special domains _ , that we call _ fundamental_. an @xmath9 change of the system of coordinates ( in the plane @xmath3 of the forms , and , consequently , on the hyperboloid ) changes the shape of _ a finite subset of the partition s tiles _",
    "( including the shape of the fundamental domains ) , but preserves all the peculiar properties of the tiling :    \\1 ) the complement to the fundamental domains of the hyperboloid is separated , by the fundamental domains , into four regions , two of which ( called _ upper regions _ ) are bounded from the circle at @xmath10 of the hyperboloid and the other two regions ( _ down regions _ ) are bounded from the circle at @xmath11 ( note that the circles at infinite are invariant under the action of the group ) .",
    "\\2 ) each one of the two upper regions and of the down regions are partitioned into a countable set of domains which are in one - to - one correspondence with all elements of the semigroup of @xmath9 generated by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "\\3 ) every orbit has the same finite number of points , say @xmath14 , in each domain of the upper regions , and the same finite number of points , say @xmath15 , in each domain of the down regions .",
    "the fundamental domains contain @xmath16 of that orbit .",
    "to understand this unusual situation ( where the partition changes without changing the number of integer points in the corresponding domains ) we give an example where the reader may verify the properties 1 and 3 above ( see also figure [ capp12 ] to see more points of the orbits , and more domains ) .",
    "this figure shows some tiles of two different partitions ( related by a change of coordinates , namely by the operator @xmath17 ) of the hyperboloid ( projected onto an open cylinder ) and the points of the three different classes of integer quadratic forms with @xmath18 , lying in these tiles .",
    "the fundamental domains are marked by thick black boundary : they contain 5 points of the first orbit ( circles ) , 5 points of the second orbit ( black discs ) and 4 points of the third orbit ( squares ) .",
    "each domain in the upper regions contains 4 points of the first orbit , one point of the second , and 2 points of the third orbit .",
    "each domain in the down regions contains 1 point of the first orbit , 4 points of the second , and 2 points of the third orbit .",
    "the classical reduction theory introduced by lagrange for the indefinite forms says that there is a finite number of forms such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are positive and @xmath21 is less than @xmath2 .",
    "the reduction procedure , allowing to find these forms , can be described in terms of the model introduced in this work .",
    "we will see this relation in more detail in part ii .",
    "the reduction theory that follows directly from our model is in fact closer to that expounded in the book `` the sensual ( quadratic ) forms '' by j.h .",
    "conway @xcite , since here the ` reduced ' forms are those having @xmath22 .",
    "we prefer this definition for the following reason : the number of reduced forms by lagrange is equal to the number @xmath23 of forms in each domain of the upper regions in our partition , whereas the number of reduced forms in our definition is the number @xmath24 of reduced forms in the fundamental domain .    however , we point out that the essential new element , with respect to the known theories , is the geometrical view - point , allowing to see the action of the group in the space of forms , exactly as for for the modular group action on the lobachevsky disc .",
    "we introduce here also the classification of the types of symmetries of the classes of forms .",
    "this classification is closely related to the classification of the symmetries of the quadratic surds continued fractions periods , answering more recent questions by arnold @xcite , as we will show in the second part of the article .",
    "we will see there also how to calculate the number of points in each domain for every class of hyperbolic forms from the coefficients of a form belonging to that class .",
    "i am deeply grateful to arnold who posed the problem in @xcite .",

    "the element of the group corresponding to a domain indicates that the fundamental domain ( @xmath93 ) is sent to this domain by that element .",
    "one sees that any domain in the right half - disc is attained , from the fundamental domain , by an operator which can be written as an element of @xmath86 followed by the identity or by @xmath67 , and any domain in the left half - disc by an element of @xmath90 followed by the identity or by @xmath67 .",
