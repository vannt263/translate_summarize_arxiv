    "on the other hand , for observations with instruments with relatively poor angular resolution , such as cwi , it may be difficult to tell whether apparently diffuse emission is in fact due to a few unresolved , dense knots , thus potentially mistaking emission from the ism of small galaxies for emission from diffuse , intergalactic gas .",
    "it will be necessary to reach fluxes well below the optical background light ( obl , hereafter ) to detect emission from the diffuse igm .",

    "we predict a maximum intensity @xmath59 photon s@xmath3@xmath4sr@xmath3 , which might be within reach of the instrument capabilities .",
    "fireball  might also be able to detect c  emission at @xmath60 , whose surface brightness should be about an order of magnitude larger than its detection limit .",

    "as such , it is likely that both lines will simply be treated as unknown contaminants .",
    "however , cross - correlation with stronger lines , such as h  ly@xmath1 , may allow a statistical detection of singlets .",
    "a positive detection would provide proof that c  and o , and lines from beryllium - like atoms in general , are indeed an efficient cooling channel and would encourage further studies of emission in the far uv band .    finally , we caution the reader that the discussion presented in this section should only be taken as a rough guide to what may be possible with upcoming facilities .",
    "more robust conclusions would require a proper study of detectability , which would involve analysing virtual observations targeted to specific instruments , instrumental modes , and observing strategies and using realistic analysis techniques .",

    "the lines of different ions of the same element are strongly correlated , but the line ratios of ions from different elements show a larger scatter .",

    "finally , we recall that while the different simulations predict very similar h  ly@xmath1  emission , the predictions for this line are uncertain due to the importance of self - shielding from ionising radiation , resonant scattering , and absorption by dust , which are all ignored here .",
    "the potential impact is illustrated by the blue dashed curve labelled ` ref ss ' in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ both_pdf ] , which indicates the surface brightness pdf if we ignore all emission from gas with @xmath88 , an assumption that is very conservative for our purposes .",
    "we have investigated the nature and detectability of redshifted rest - frame uv line emission from the igm ( i.e.  @xmath89 ) at @xmath8 . while more strongly biased towards high - density gas than absorption lines , emission lines offer the possibility to directly map the distribution of the gas and metals in three dimensions . following the procedures of @xcite",
    ", we used a set of large , cosmological , hydrodynamical simulations taken from the owls  project @xcite to create simulated maps of a set of strong rest - frame uv emission lines .",
    "we focused on c , c , n , o , ne , si  and si  lines ( see table  [ eltable ] ) , which are the strongest metal lines that trace the diffuse igm and that can potentially be detected by current and upcoming optical instruments . for reference , we also showed results for h  ly@xmath1  and he  h@xmath1  and for the former we illustrated the potential impact of self - shielding and dust extinction by considering only the flux emitted by gas with @xmath90 , which provides a conservative estimate of the minimum signal that can be expected .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "depending on the line and the redshift , we predict a maximum surface brightnesses of order @xmath91 photon s@xmath3@xmath4sr@xmath3  in the redshift interval @xmath0 for 2  pixels ( see fig .",
    "[ redshift_pdf ] ) .",
    "the strongest igm emission comes from h  ly@xmath1 , provided we include emission from gas with @xmath92 .",
    "the highest surface brightness metal - line emission comes from c  and is about an order of magnitude fainter .",
    "the highest surface brightness regions for c , si , si  and o  lines are fainter than the brightest c  by factors of a few .",
    "the n  and ne  lines , as well as he  h@xmath1 , are substantially fainter but their maximum surface brightnesses still exceed @xmath2 photon s@xmath3@xmath4sr@xmath3  for @xmath5 ( and 2  pixels ) .",
    "2 .   lines from different ions trace gas in different temperature regimes .",
    "the gas responsible for the highest surface brightness metal - line emission typically has temperatures close to the peak of the corresponding emissivity curve .",
    "h  ly@xmath1 , he  ly@xmath1 , c , si  and si  lines prevalently trace gas with @xmath93k near galaxies , making them excellent probes of cold accretion flows and the colder parts of galactic winds",
    ". c   ( @xmath94k ) , n   ( @xmath95k ) , o   ( @xmath96k ) , and ne   ( @xmath97k ) trace the warmer gas in haloes and filaments and thus constitute powerful tools to study the whim and the warmer parts of outflows .",
    "while the brightest h  ly@xmath1  emission arises exclusively in highly overdense gas ( @xmath73 ) , at least if we assume the gas to be optically thin , a much wider range of overdensities contributes to the brightest pixels of he  ly@xmath1  and high - ionisation metal lines such as c , o  and ne .",
    "the spatial distribution of the emission is related to the ionisation state of the emitting gas .",
    "lower ionisation gas produces clumpier and more clustered emission , while higher ionisation gas produces smoother and more diffuse emission profiles .",
    "the degree of ionisation decreases with increasing density but increases with the temperature .",
    "as the emissivity increases with the gas density , emission from lower - ionisation gas tends to be brighter .",
    "indeed , we find for example that the beryllium - like atoms n  and o   ( which were not shown here because they only shift into the optical waveband for very high redshifts ) are stronger than their higher - ionisation lithium - like counterparts .",
    "we have compared our fiducial simulation with models that ignore sn feedback and/or metal - line cooling , with a model that includes highly mass - loaded `` momentum - driven '' galactic winds , and with a simulation that takes feedback from agn into account . while the faint metal - line emission is very sensitive to the inclusion and implementation of galactic winds ( because these are responsible for enriching the low - density igm with metals , where the weak emission is produced ) , the results for bright metal - line emission , and even more so for both faint and bright h  ly@xmath1  emission , are remarkably robust to changes in these physical processes .",
    "accurate cooling rates are required to predict the bright metal - line emission with a precision better than a factor of a few , particularly for lines that peak at temperatures for which the cooling time is short , such as o. agn feedback primarily affects the emission from the cores of haloes , reducing the brightest metal - line emission by up to factors of a few .",
    "highly mass - loaded galactic winds , on the other hand , can boost the brightest metal - line emission by similar factors .",
    "5 .   according to our predictions",
    ", muse  and kcwi  should be able to detect h  ly@xmath1  emission from regions with @xmath42 up to at least @xmath43 ( provided our optically thin calculation is appropriate in this regime ) , while h  ly@xmath1  from less dense regions and the he  h@xmath1  line should be visible at lower redshifts .",
    "c , o  and si  will all be detectable up to @xmath7 , while c  and si  should be detectable up to @xmath48 .",
    "the n  and ne  lines should also be within the capabilities of these instruments .",
    "we note , however , that lines with rest - frame wavelengths shorter than that of ly@xmath1  ( i.e.  c , o , ne , and si ) may suffer substantial foreground absorption , which we have not accounted for here .",
    "o  lines at @xmath58 and c  lines at @xmath60 are roughly within the sensitivity of the fireball  experiment , and should be considered as possible contaminants of ly@xmath1  emission .",
    "+ we conclude that several rest - frame uv emission lines from the high - redshift igm will become detectable in the near future , possibly starting with the cwi  which is already operating on palomar .",
    "observations of these lines have the potential to revolutionise studies of the interactions between high - redshift galaxies and their environment .",
    "lower ionisation lines provide us with tools to image cold accretion flows as well as cold , outflowing clouds .",
    "higher ionisation lines , on the other hand , will allow us to image the metal - enriched whim and galactic winds .",
    "such observations , particularly the simultaneous detection of multiple lines , will provide strong constraints on the density , temperature , and chemical composition of the gas .",
