    "these days the experimental techniques have made a lot of progress and good experimentalists have synthesized the nanoscale magnets which realize the models that had been discussed only theoretically before . among them are the bip - teno as the spin-@xmath1 two - leg ladder  @xcite , the compound [ ( cucl@xmath2tachh)@xmath3cl]cl@xmath2 ( tach=_cis , trans_-1,3,5-triamino - cyclohexane ) as the triangular spin nanotube  @xcite , and the oxygen molecules adsorbed on the inner surface of the porous material as a many - leg spin tube  @xcite .",
    "the spin ladders  @xcite and tubes  @xcite have attracted attention in the course of the extensive studies on the low - dimensional magnets , part of which started from the discussions on the haldane gap  @xcite of the one - dimensional spin chains .",
    "the appearance of the spin excitation gap is one of the interesting macroscopic quantum phenomena . in spin-@xmath0 systems , it occurs when the frustration in the spin - spin interaction or the lattice dimerization is introduced .",
    "a good example of the former case is the triangular spin nanotube  @xcite whose spontanous dimerized and gapped ground state had been theoretically investigated  @xcite and now got a strong possibility of an experimental realization in the near future  @xcite . during the course of studies on the low - dimensional systems , the huge amount of studies on the carbon nanotubes were done in the 90 s , and the striking properties on the electric conductivity of the chiral nanotubes were found out .",
    "namely , a carbon nanotube can be either a metal or a semiconductor , either of which is determined by the chiral vector  @xcite .    with the great progress in experiments and theories , it is now interesting in both respects to ask , if the carbon atoms are replaced by some magnetic ions on the chiral nanotubes and the antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions between them are introduced , are there any relations between the chiral vector and the magnetic properties analogous to the carbon nanotubes  @xcite ?",
    "the real experiments should be done in the near future . as for the numerical experiments ,",
    "we take the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnets on the chiral nanotubes made from the honeycomb strips as the simplest systems that the quantum effects bring about interesting properties .",
    "remarkably , these models always enable us to perform numerical experiments by the quantum monte carlo method without suffering from the notorious negative sign problem  @xcite .",
    "this is not generally the case for the spin nanotubes because they sometimes contain frustration in the spin - spin interactions  @xcite .",
    "the details are explained in the next section .",
    "we investigate the ground state properties of the spin chiral nanotubes with several kinds of chiral vectors .",
    "our model is the spin-@xmath0 antiferromagnetic heisenberg tube .",
    "the tube is made from a strip of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "an example of the strip is shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] . the honeycomb strip can be seen as the coupled dimerized chains in the strongest dimerization limit with the configuration of the dimers in the anti - phase way along the interchain direction . using the terminology of the low - dimensional strongly correlated systems , we call the bond along the dimerized chains as the ` leg ' and that along the interchain direction as the ` rung ' .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as follows .",
    "@xmath4 { \\mathbf s}_{j , k}\\cdot { \\mathbf s}_{j+1,k } \\nonumber \\\\ & + j_y\\sum_{j=1}^{l } \\left ( % \\left ( \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}{\\mathbf s}_{j , k}\\cdot { \\mathbf s}_{j , k+1 } % \\right ) + { \\mathbf s}_{j , n}\\cdot { \\mathbf s}_{j+m,1}\\right ) \\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the spin-@xmath0 operator with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) specifying the position on the leg ( rung ) .",
    "the number of legs is @xmath8 , and the number of sites along the leg is @xmath9 .",
    "we impose the periodic boundary condition in both of the rung and the leg directions such that @xmath10 and @xmath11 . if @xmath12 is finite , chirality is introduced in the tube structure .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 are positive .",
    "we set the @xmath15-axis along the dimerized chains .",
    "the ground state property in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath16 , is investigated .    in our spin nanotube , the same structure as that of the carbon nanotube",
    "is kept when the imposed periodic boundary condition along the rung direction satisfies the condition that @xmath17 is an even number . in this case , there is no frustration between the spin - spin interactions and we can perform numerical experiments by the quantum monte carlo method without suffering from the negative sign problem  @xcite .",
    "the chiral vector of the tube is defined by @xmath18 , where the lattice vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 are shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] . in terms of our parameters , it is written as @xmath21 .",
    "we determine the quantum critical points of the model and discuss their distribution in our parameter space .",
    "the positions of them are specified by the parameter @xmath22 which connects continuously the strong leg coupling limit at @xmath23 to the strong rung coupling limit at @xmath24 .",
    "the phase diagram is drawn on the @xmath25 axis .",
    "we note that the isotropic nanotube is realized on the point @xmath26 .",
    "the phase boundaries are determined by the the expectation value of the lieb - schultz - mattis slow - twist operator  @xcite , which is used to detect the bond order specific to the gapped states . for our model",
    ", it is defined as follows .",
    "\\right>_{0}\\ ] ] here @xmath28 means the expectation value in the ground state .",
    "the quantum critical points are given by the thermodynamic limit of the zeros of @xmath29 .",
    "the observables including @xmath29 are evaluated by the quantum monte carlo method with the continuous - time loop algorithm  @xcite , which is actually a finite - temperature algorithm , for several finite sizes . assuming the lorentz invariance  @xcite , the temperature @xmath30 is fixed to the value of @xmath31 .",
    "the critical point in both of the limits @xmath32 i.e. the thermodynamic limit at zero temperature , is determined by the crossing point of @xmath29 s calculated for several @xmath9 s .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ zl_example ] for the chiral nanotube with @xmath33 .",
    "we can identify the quantum critical point at @xmath34 .",
    "thus determined quantum critical points for several chiral nanotubes are shown in fig .",
    "the characteristic of the resultant distribution of the quantum critical points in fig .",
    "[ qcp ] is the difference with respect to the parity of the number of the fully dimerized chains , @xmath8 . for the nanotube with even ( odd )",
    "@xmath8 , the number of the quantum critical points is seen to be @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this reflects the well - known even - odd effect in the ground state of uniform ( i.e. non - dimerized ) spin ladders  @xcite that is expected to hold also to the spin tubes without frustration . in this effect , the even - legged uniform systems have an excitation gap while the odd - legged ones do not .",
    "we sum up with a few remarks on the comparison of the spin nanotubes with the carbon ones .",
    "we note that @xmath8 is written in terms of the chiral vector , @xmath37 , as @xmath38 .",
    "the topology of the ground - state phase diagram of the spin nanotubes is determined by the parity of @xmath8 , in contrast to the carbon nanotubes where the electric property on the point @xmath26 is known by asking whether @xmath39 is a multiple of @xmath40 or not .",
    "so far we have only determined the quantum critical points of the spin chiral nanotubes and discussed the topology of the ground - state phase diagram with respect to the chiral vector .",
    "further investigations are now in progress .",
