    "since its first proposal in 1993@xcite , quantum teleportation has been the subject of intensive study , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "up to now , quantum teleportation of superposed photon polarization states@xcite , superposed one - photon and vacuum states@xcite , and continuous variable light states@xcite has been demonstrated experimentally . although teleportation can be achieved ideally with the success probability of 1 and the fidelity of 1 , there exist many practical limitations , such as various sources of decoherence , finite efficiency of detectors , lack of reliable single - photon sources , difficulty with perfect bell - state measurements , and nonmaximal entanglement , that need to be overcome before the experimental performance can match ideal theoretical predictions .",
    "+ the process of teleportation may be regarded as the transfer of quantum information through a quantum channel .",
    "when the quantum channel is provided by a maximally entangled pair , quantum teleportation faithfully transmits the quantum information .",
    "amplitude errors during generation or distribution of entanglement , however , degrade the degree of entanglement .",
    "the practical question of importance is thus what one should or can do when the sender , alice , and the receiver , bob , share nonmaximal entanglement .",
    "different strategies should be adopted by alice and bob depending upon the situation .",
    "they may choose the teleportation scheme that would yield the maximum average fidelity . in some cases , however , what is required is not to obtain the maximum information but to avoid making any mistake even at the expense of lowered success probability . in such cases",
    ", they can adopt the strategy of `` conclusive teleportation''@xcite , in which the teleportation succeeds with the probability less than one but alice knows when it succeeds or not , and when it succeeds the fidelity of the teleported state is one",
    ". there are three approaches to conclusive teleportation that alice and bob can take .",
    "first , they may try to extract maximally entangled pairs out of the given nonmaximally entangled pairs through the process of entanglement concentration@xcite , and perform teleportation with the concentrated pairs .",
    "the number of the concentrated pairs is less than the number of the original nonmaximally entangled pairs , i.e. , the probability for concentration is less than one , but the fidelity of the teleported state using the concentrated pair as the quantum channel is one .",
    "second , alice may perform the standard bell - state measurements directly with the nonmaximally entangled pairs and let bob apply an appropriate unitary transformation with the aid of an auxiliary qubit to obtain the desired state probabilistically@xcite .",
    "the success probability is less than one , but bob knows whether he obtained the desired state or not by observing the state of the auxiliary qubit .",
    "third , alice may perform `` generalized measurements''@xcite(or positive operator valued measurement ) upon the nonmaximally entangled pairs that distinguish nonorthogonal `` bell - type '' states conclusively with a certain probability less than one@xcite .",
    "when the measurement outcome corresponds to the conclusive event , the teleportation succeeds with the fidelity of 1 . + it is this third approach we wish to study in detail here .",
    "we construct linear optical schemes that enable one to perform the desired generalized measurements for three different cases for which two basis states for a qubit are given by ( a ) @xmath0 , a single - photon state , and @xmath1 , the vacuum state , ( b ) @xmath2 , a vertically - polarized photon state , and @xmath3 , a horizontally - polarized photon state , and ( c ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 , two coherent light states with opposite phases .",
    "we analyze and compare the generalized measurement process for conclusive teleportation for the three cases .",
    "the reason we study and compare these three cases is that , although the basic principles governing the generalized measurement and teleportation processes may be the same regardless of the choice of qubit states , one may have significant advantages over another when the actual experimental implementation of the scheme is considered .",
    "we need only to recall that , in quantum key distribution , the choice of @xmath6 and @xmath7 has led to the phase coding scheme which offers significant practical advantages over the polarization coding scheme resulting from the choice of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in case of quantum teleportation with maximal entanglement",
    ", investigations in the past have revealed that the three cases require different levels of experimental sophistication in bell - state measurements and in state transformations@xcite .",
    "for example , polarizing beam splitters needed in bell - state measurements for case ( b ) are not required for case ( a ) ; instead , detectors in case ( a ) need to distinguish a single photon from two@xcite .",
    "the state transformations required in cases ( a ) and ( b ) are all unitary , but some transformations involved in case ( c ) are nonunitary@xcite .",
    "what makes case ( c ) still particularly interesting is the fact that four `` quasi bell states '' can in principle be all distinguished with a high probability using only linear optical means@xcite , whereas for cases ( a ) and ( b ) only two of the four bell states can be distinguished linear optically . since in general a different choice of qubit states leads to a different experimental setup for generalized measurements with different optical devices which may respond differently to an attempt to compensate for amplitude errors that caused nonmaximal entanglement , it should be of interest to analyze and compare in detail the experimental schemes for conclusive teleportation for different choices of qubit states .",
    "such comparison and analysis have indeed led to the main result of our work that the success probability is much more resistant to amplitude errors for case ( c ) than for case ( a ) or ( b ) .",
    "in this section we construct linear optical schemes for generalized measurements and analyze the generalized measurements that need to be performed with the proposed schemes , for the three different cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) mentioned in the previous section .",

    "the success probability for case ( c ) remains much closer to its maximum value for the same amount of amplitude errors .",

    "<S> we present linear optical schemes to perform generalized measurements for conclusive teleportation when the sender and the receiver share nonmaximal entanglement resulting from amplitude errors during propagation or generation . </S>",
    "<S> three different cases are considered for which the states to be teleported are unknown superpositions of ( a ) single - photon and vacuum states , ( b ) vertically - polarized and horizontally - polarized photon states , and ( c ) two coherent states of opposite phases . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized measurement scheme for each case is analyzed , which indicates that the success probability is much more resistant to amplitude errors for case ( c ) than for case ( a ) or ( b ) . </S>"
