    "single - photon devices play a crucial role in quantum information science , including quantum communication and quantum computing technology  @xcite .",
    "these devices are useful for quantum key distribution  @xcite , generation of entangled states  @xcite , quantum metrology  @xcite , single - photon quantum memory  @xcite , linear optical quantum computing  @xcite , and quantum simulations  @xcite .",
    "thus , a highly - efficient method for generating single - photons with low error is urgently required for quantum information processing .",
    "similar to coulomb blockade for electrons in mesoscopic electronic devices  @xcite , photon blockade , where the subsequent photons are prevented from resonantly entering a cavity , is a promising way to produce single - photon sources .",
    "photon blockade requires that the strength of the photon - photon kerr nonlinear interaction  @xcite is much larger than the decay rate of the cavity field .    in principle",
    ", the photon blockade can be measured by the second - order correlation functions of photons  @xcite .",
    "photon blockade in the optical frequency domain has been observed in : a trapped atom coupled to a cavity field  @xcite , a two - level system coupled to a bimodal microtoroidal resonator  @xcite , and a quantum dot coupled to single - mode field of a photonic crystal resonator  @xcite .",
    "recently , photon blockade in the microwave frequency domain was also observed  @xcite by coupling a superconducting artificial atom  @xcite to a transmission line resonator .",
    "a crucial prerequisite for photon blockade in these experiments  @xcite is to reach the strong field - atom coupling regime  @xcite , i.e. , the coupling strength between the cavity field and the dipole - quantum - emitter ( dqe ) exceeding the decay rates of both the cavity field and dqe .",
    "the strong dqe - field coupling can induce a strong nonlinear photon - photon interaction and could be used to produce photon blockade and single - photon sources  @xcite .",
    "however , when a cavity field works at the single - photon level , it is not easy to achieve a cavity - atom - induced strong photon - photon interaction .",
    "recently , photonic molecule   systems , consisting of two coupled cavities with kerr nonlinearities , were proposed to generate antibunching photon and photon blockade  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous studies  @xcite , it was found that the photon blockade can occur even in a weak field - atom coupling regime , when an additional cavity is coupled  @xcite .",
    "this new mechanism corresponds to a destructive quantum interference effect in nonlinear photonic molecule systems  @xcite .",
    "motivated by several studies  @xcite , various systems were proposed to achieve photon blockade and antibunching photons , such as coupled optomechanical systems  @xcite , dipolariton systems formed by cavity fields and excitons  @xcite , coherent - feedback controlled optomechanical systems  @xcite , and coupled microcavities with second- or third - order nonlinearities  @xcite .",
    "however , the role of the coupled cavity was not explored in detail .",
    "thus it is interesting to further explore this issue as a function of the coupling strength between the two cavities .    motivated by an experiment  @xcite on a photon turnstile , in which a dqe is embeded in a bimodal whispering - gallery - mode cavity ( wgmc )  @xcite , we here mainly study the mode coupling effect on the nonclassical properties of photons . for two strongly - coupled resonators  @xcite , two modes of two resonators",
    "are coupled to different nonlinear quantum systems or only one of the cavity modes is coupled to a nonlinear quantum system .",
    "however , here : ( i ) a single wgmc is used to support two degenerate counter - propagating cavity modes ; ( ii ) the mode coupling or normal - mode splitting between these two counter - propagating modes is realized by a scattering object  @xcite ; ( iii ) two cavity modes are coupled to the same dqe . compared to the studies where a two - level system is coupled to two modes of a cavity  @xcite , here",

    "we also compare our results with those in coupled - cavity systems  @xcite .",

    "such two wgm modes have a dqe - field coupling rate @xmath1 and intrinisc cavity decay rate @xmath2 .",
