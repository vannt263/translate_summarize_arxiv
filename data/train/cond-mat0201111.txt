    "charged colloids ( macroions ) might exhibit very surprising behaviors due to the coulomb interaction and the two different length scales involved there : ( i ) microscopic ( counterions ) and ( ii ) mesoscopic ( macroions ) .",
    "a very spectacular effect which has attracted great attention these last years is the phenomenon of overcharging @xcite .",
    "this situation occurs when the number of counterions in the vicinity of the macroion surface is so high that the macro - particle bare charge is overcompensated ( charge inversion ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed experimentally by electrophoresis @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "a massive effort has been recently devoted to elucidate this striking phenomenon .",
    "wigner crystal theories have been successfully applied to understand charge inversion @xcite and quantitative agreement was found with simulations @xcite .",
    "it turns out that all numerical and analytical methods , undertaken so far , neglect the _ discrete _ nature of the macroion charge distribution .",
    "but in realistic systems the macroion charge is not continuously distributed over the macro - particle , but rather carried by small microscopic ions .",
    "it is only very recently that a simulation study has been reported where the macroion charge discreteness has been considered @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the effect of the macroion charge distribution discreteness .",
    "in particular , we study this effect on the overcharging properties . besides we show that it is possible to have stronger overcharge in the discrete case than in the continuous case .",
    "the procedure is similar to the one used in a previous study @xcite .",
    "the macroion charge discretization is produced by using @xmath1 _ monovalent _ microions of diameter @xmath2 distributed _ randomly _ on the surface of the macroion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.snap ] ) .",
    "then the macroion structural charge is @xmath3 @xcite where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the positive elementary charge .",
    "the counterions have a charge @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for the counterion valence . the discrete colloidal charges ( dcc ) are _ fixed _ on the surface of the spherical macroion and are at a distance @xmath8 from the macroion center .",
    "thus to produce a random discrete charge distribution on the surface we generated ( uniformly ) randomly the variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath10 are the standard spherical angle coordinates .",
    "excluded volume is taken into account by rejecting configurations leading to an overlap of microions .",
    "phenomena such as surface chemical reactions @xcite , hydration , roughness @xcite are not considered .",
    "a md simulation technique was used to compute the motion of the counterions coupled to a heat bath acting through a weak stochastic force * w*(t ) .",
    "the motion of counterion _ i",
    "_ obeys @xmath12 where _ m _ is the counterion mass , @xmath13 is the potential force having two contributions : ( i ) the coulomb interaction and ( ii ) the excluded volume interaction , and @xmath14 is the friction coefficient .",
    "friction and stochastic force are linked by the dissipation - fluctuation theorem @xmath15 . for the ground state simulations the stochastic force",
    "is set to zero .",
    "excluded volume interactions are taken into account with a pure repulsive lennard - jones potential given by    @xmath16 + \\epsilon,\\ ] ]    if @xmath17 , and @xmath18 otherwise . for the microion - microion interaction ( the microion being either a counterion and/or a dcc ) , whereas @xmath19 for the macroion - counterion interaction , and @xmath20 is the cutoff radius .",
    "this leads to a macroion - counterion distance of closest approach @xmath21 .",
    "energy and length units in our simulations are related to experimental units by taking @xmath22@xmath23 ( with @xmath24 k ) , and @xmath25 respectively .    the pair electrostatic interaction between any pair _ ij _ , where _ i _ and _ j _ denote either a dcc , a counterion or the central charge ( for the case of the continuous surface charge distribution ) , reads    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the bjerrum length ( here @xmath28 ) describing the electrostatic strength .",
    "the macroion and the counterions are confined in a spherical impenetrable cell . the macroion is held fixed and is located at the center of the cell . to avoid image charge complications ,",
    "the permittivity @xmath29 is supposed to be identical within the whole cell ( including the macroion ) as well as outside the cell .",
    "the simplest way to quantify overcharging in salt - free environment is to compute the total electrostatic energy of the system in the _ ground state _ ( i. e. , @xmath30k ) as a function of the number of overcharging counterions @xmath31 .",
    "although this approach is very idealized , it allows an insight into the mechanisms governing overcharging .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in what follows we are going to compare systematically ( for a macroion charge @xmath32 ) the overcharging occurring in the continuous case ( cc ) , as is conventionally done , and in the discrete case ( with dcc ions ) .",
    "[ fig.snap ] shows a typical starting equilibrium configuration with a discrete macroion charge distribution where the system is globally neutral ( before adding excess overcharging counterions ) .",
    "[ fig.oc](a ) shows overcharging energy profiles for @xmath32 and @xmath33 counterions ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "it is observed that overcharging is stronger in the continuous case than in the discrete case as one could expect .",
    "more precisely the gain in energy as well as the maximal number of stabilizing overcharging counterions ( corresponding to a minimum in the @xmath35 curve ) are higher when the surface macroion charge is continuous .",
    "indeed , having in mind that overcharging is enhanced by counterion ordering , it is clear that in the discrete case where strong ionic pairing occurs ( between dcc site and counterion - see fig .",
    "[ fig.snap ] ) the counterion ordering is lowered and thus leads to a weaker charge inversion .",
    "however since overcharging occurs in the discrete case , the excess counterions still experience an attractive interaction with their neighboring dipoles ( ionic pairs ) .",
    "this ion - dipole interaction is the driving force for the overcharging in the discrete case with monovalent counterions .",
    "nevertheless it has been shown elsewhere @xcite that by decreasing the mean separation between dcc sites ( i. e. , increasing macroion charge density ) the difference in overcharging between discrete and continuous macroion charge distribution decreases .    when we consider @xmath36 counterions the situation is qualitatively different .",
    "indeed , one observes that for @xmath37 2 and 3 overcharging is even stronger in the discrete case [ see figs .",
    "[ fig.oc ] ( b - c ) ] .",
    "this is a rather counter - intuitive phenomenon , since ionic pairing is still effective .",
    "the crucial difference between monovalent and multivalent counterion systems is that overcharging occurs with ionic pairing for multivalent counterions ( since free monovalent dcc sites are unbound ) , whereas for monovalent counterions only ion - dipole interaction can take place ( since in the neutral state @xmath38 dcc site is already bound with a monovalent counterion ) . obviously for these systems under consideration depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig.oc ] ( b - c ) , the ionic pairing energy is a fundamental quantity that controls the overcharging strength .",
    "more precisely , the stronger the ionic bonding the more efficiently it overcomes the @xmath39 overcharge `` self - energy '' , and therefore the higher the overcharging for multivalent counterion systems .    beside of the ionic bonding strength",
    "there is another important parameter controlling overcharging : the surface macroion charge density .",
    "when the macroion charge density is high enough ( not reported here ) then the @xmath40 curves become quasi - identical for discrete and continuous charge distributions . in terms of length scales ,",
    "the relevant parameter controlling charge reversal with discrete distribution is the ration @xmath41 between the mean distance between dcc and the distance separation of the ionic pair . for low @xmath41",
    "the effects of discretization are very important whereas for @xmath42 one recovers the continuous limit .",
    "we carried out md simulations to elucidate the effect of discrete macroion charge distribution on the overcharging .",
    "we showed that overcharging is still effective in the discrete case .",
    "for multivalent counterions and a sufficiently low macroion charge density , overcharging can even be stronger in the discrete case than in the continuous case .",
    "future works will address aqueous solutions at finite temperature as well as the presence of salt - ions .",
    "note that in the usual @xmath43 case ( and only in this case ) , thanks to gauss theorem it is equivalent ( as far as the electrostatic field outside the macroion is concerned ) to consider a central point charge carrying the charge @xmath44 ."
