    "the statistical mechanics of linear polymers has long attracted the attention of physicists and chemists alike .",
    "the mechanics of dna is of considerable biological relevance to describing the free energy landscape controlling protein - induced dna bending .",
    "these protein - dna interactions are of central importance to cellular function on a microscopic scale , from chromosomal dna packaging , to transcription , and gene regulation , to viral packaging @xcite .",
    "protein - dna interactions typically induce short - length - scale dna bending which couples the chemical and physical properties of dna @xcite .",
    "a particularly important and successful application of polymer statistics has been in the description of double stranded dna ( dsdna ) by the wormlike chain model ( wlc ) . in the wlc model",
    ", dna is modeled as a fluctuating , linearly - elastic rod .",
    "this simple model has been remarkably successful in describing many aspects of dna mechanics and the statistics of semiflexible polymers generally . in particular",
    ", wlc describes the extension of a single dsdna molecule under an external force with impressive precision @xcite .    despite the notable theoretical and experimental success of the wormlike chain model , recent dna cyclization studies by cloutier and",
    "widom @xcite have cast doubt on the validity of the wlc model for describing the cyclization of short - contour - length sequences of dna . in still more recent cyclization studies , vologodskii and coworkers",
    "claim that the wlc model does accurately describe the cyclization of short dna sequences @xcite . nevertheless , as we will explain later a number of experiments",
    "do seem to point to a role for elastic breakdown in dna mechanics .    with the current experimental situation still in flux",
    ", it seems imperative to reevaluate the wlc model _ theoretically .",
    "_ we wish to answer the questions : _ ( i )",
    "_ how could such a simple theory hope to describe a complex molecule like dna ? _ ( ii ) _ more precisely , which classes of experiments would we expect to be successfully described by wlc model , and which might require a different theory ?",
    "do these experiments correspond to the known successes or the recently reported failures of the theory ?",
    "in other words , we are asking how much _ room _ do the classic tests of wlc model leave for generalization of this model , and how completely do these experiments test the wlc model ? finally , we must ask _ ( iii ) _ would a breakdown of the wlc model have any biological significance ?    the focus of this paper will be the theoretical analysis of these questions and the development and discussion of more general semiflexible polymer models .",
    "although these ideas are widely applicable to polymers statistics in general , the focus of this paper will be exclusively the mechanics of dna .",
    "we shall attempt a synthesis of the existing experimental knowledge to determine which aspects of dna bending are probed by existing experiments . in particular ,",
    "we determine which experiments are most sensitive to the dna mechanics relevant for understanding biological systems . in the remainder of this introduction",
    ", we shall quickly outline our answers to the questions posed above .",
    "first , to put the possible breakdown of the wlc model into perspective , it is helpful to consider the bending of macroscopic rods . to engineers in the mechanics community , whose work has been the study of macroscopic bending , the failure of a linear elastic model at high curvature is more pedestrian than remarkable .",
    "the linear elastic theory is understood to apply only to the small deflection limit .",
    "what is perhaps more remarkable to some is that a linear - elastic model describes a macromolecular polymer at all , let alone to the accuracy illustrated by force - extension measurements !    to put the success of the wlc model into perspective , it is helpful to consider dna mechanics from the viewpoint of the statistical mechanics of condensed matter systems .",
    "many physical properties of complicated condensed matter systems have been described by a small set of theories described in terms of renormalizable operators @xcite .",
    "regardless of the complicated structure of the theory at short length scales , the renormalization group ( rg ) guarantees that the long - length - scale chain statistics will be described * * with the right symmetries . as a consequence ,",
    "all semiflexible polymers share generic long - length - scale behavior : that described by the wlc model .",
    "physically , this loss of information about the microscopic details of molecular mechanics arises from the averaging effect of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the rg world - view leads us to expect that experiments like measuring the force - extension relation of long dna would reveal only generic behavior , insensitive to microscopic details of dna elasticity .",
    "but , on short enough length scales , the underlying structure of the theory becomes important .",
    "violations of the linear elastic theory , analogous to those observed in macroscopic bending , are therefore expected in experiments that probe the short - length - scale bending of dna .",
    "indeed , early afm imaging experiments did see the onset of deviations from wlc expectations on short scales @xcite .",
    "cyclization experiments , like the ones in , hold the prospect of greater sensitivity to the high - curvature regime .",
    "this paper develops the qualitative framework outlined above by introducing a generalization of the wormlike chain model . this class of models , introduced in , generalizes the wlc by describing a semiflexible polymer by an arbitrary local bending energy function .",
    "[gfret ] introduce an explicit toy model of dna bending , the `` sub - elastic chain '' model ( sec ) , motivated by imaging data on dna adsorbed to mica @xcite , and by recent nanoscale force measurements @xcite .",
    "illustrates a computational procedure for computing the tangent distribution function for arbitrary contour length in generalized theories . introduces the persistence length in generalized theories and shows that these theories converge to the wlc model at long contour length .",
    "the remainder of the paper focuses on the spatial distribution of the polymer .",
    "the spatial distribution is of particular importance for biological applications where the contribution of chain statistics to biological function can often be formulated in terms of an effective end - concentration , the jacobson ",
    "stockmayer factor ( @xmath0 factor ) .",
    "physically , this effective concentration is the probability density of the polymer having the correct configuration for binding to the binding site of a protein . introduces a method for computing the spatial and tangent - spatial distributions of generalized semiflexible polymer models in terms of a framework developed by spakowitz and wang @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "explicitly computes the spatial distributions for both the sec and wlc models for various contour lengths .",
    "we discuss the renormalization group applied to spatial distributions and show the predicted convergence of the sec and wlc models at long contour length . and [ gssf ] show that the force extension and the structure factor computed for general theories are nearly identical to the wlc model results , implying that these experiments do not probe the high - curvature chain statistics important for many biological processes . computes the cyclization @xmath0 factor for generic theories .",
    "we show that the sec model gives rise to the enhanced cyclization efficiency for short - contour - length sequences observed by cloutier and widom @xcite while leaving the long - contour - length @xmath0 factor identical to that predicted by the wlc model .",
    "finally , we discuss the results of this paper in the context of the recent cyclization measurements of vologodskii and coworkers @xcite and recent measurements of the deflection force for short sequences of dna @xcite .      following crick and klug s initial suggestion that dna might kink @xcite , many classical works investigated the structural implications of this conformational change at the single - basepair level ( reviewed in @xcite ) . indeed , many known dna - protein complexes do display kinks in the dna backbone .",
    "in contrast , our focus here is on physical measurements of dna mechanics on a mesoscopic , several - basepair scale relevant for biological processes like dna looping in vivo .",
    "as described in , both yan and marko and we previously formulated and solved `` kinking '' models , in which dna is assumed to undergo a sudden loss of bend stiffness beyond a critical stress @xcite .",
    "other related models were also formulated and solved in and @xcite .",
    "sucato et al .",
    "have also performed monte carlo simulations of kinkable chains , to obtain information about their structural and thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "unlike these prior articles , the present work explores the proposal that the breakdown of linear elasticity , when coarsegrained to the mesoscopic scale , is effectively less abrupt than in the kinking models .",
    "we suggest that such a model can reconcile the growing evidence for elastic breakdown with the generic absence of sharply kinked states when tightly - bent dna is observed microscopically .",
    "* the bending energy density of a general model of the sort just described can be written in terms of the arc length @xmath1 , the tangent vector @xmath2 along the curve , and its derivatives : @xmath3 where the energy density depends on arbitrarily high derivatives of the tangent vector @xmath4 .",
    "we shall not study this completely general framework , but a restricted subclass of models .",
    "* first we shall assume that the free energy density does not explicitly depend on the position @xmath5 ( the chain is homogeneous ) .",
    "strictly , this is not the case for dna since both the helical pitch and the sequence dependence spoil homogeneity @xcite .",
    "we will study the mechanics of dna on length scales longer than the helical repeat ( 3.6 nm ) , where helical effects approximately average to zero .",
    "sequence dependence is a more serious omission @xcite , but we make this approximation in order to get analytical formulas . having agreed to neglect helical effects , it is reasonable to add the assumption that the theory is rotationally invariant ( the bending stiffness is isotropic ) .",
    "last , we assume that the energy density involves only the first derivative of @xmath2 , the discretized version of curvature : @xmath6 by rotational invariance , the energy density is a function of the magnitude of the curvature only : @xmath7 * of these assumptions , the most subtle is that associated with discarding the derivatives of the curvature . in the interest of brevity , we shall call this condition locality since it describes theories of semiflexible polymers with the fewest derivatives of the tangents .",
    "it is not manifestly imperative that this restricted class of models describes dna .",
    "we have chosen this subset of general models motivated by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) experiments which we shall discuss in .",
    "* we will return to this point again briefly in the discussion ( ) .",
    "an important one - parameter family of polymer theories is described by an energy density that is quadratic in the curvature : @xmath8 * * a wlc model is completely characterized by one number , the elastic bending modulus @xmath9 .",
    "we define the statistical mechanics theory associated to an energy function @xmath10 in the canonical way .",
    "the probability of a coarse - grained chain conformation is given by the boltzmann law : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the partition function , determined by normalization , and we have defined the effective - coarse - grained free energy @xmath13 in units of @xmath14 . * in fact , we shall simply define the energy by . *    * *    to define a statistical mechanics theory , the notion of an energy density is not sufficient .",
    "we must also introduce a fundamental length scale on which to define the theory . to determine the partition function @xmath12",
    ", we must have an explicit method for enumerating all possible states . to be explicit ,",
    "we define the theory at scale @xmath15 by discretizing the configuration into links length @xmath15 , separated by torsional springs whose energy is a function of the deflection angle @xmath16 between adjacent links @xmath17 and @xmath18 . this discretized chain is pictured schematically in",
    ". we shall interpret ( or define ) the bending energy density by taking it to be the bending energy for a uniformly bent arc with deflection angle @xmath16 and length @xmath15 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the total bending energy @xmath13 for a configuration of links is the sum of these vertex energies .    in mechanics ,",
    "a continuum model would be defined by the limit as the link length goes to zero . in this limit ,",
    "the energy is independent of the link length @xmath15 . but this will not be the case in general statistical mechanics theories . the behavior of the theory , and experimental obeservables , depend on the fundamental length scale @xmath15 .",
    "there is , however , a    the systematic study of the length scale dependence of statistical mechanics theories is called renormalization group theory @xcite .",
    "if we confine our interest to the description of the tangents of the polymer ,    there is only one renormalizable term in the energy density with the right symmetries to meet our assumptions .",
    "the fact that more general energy densities always have continuum limits describable by wlc models does not mean , however , that the wlc exhausts the physically legitimate and interesting models for stiff polymers .",
    "after all , we can not expect continuum elasticity to remain valid on molecular length scales .",
    "rather , this observation only implies that models more general than wlc must be defined with respect to some finite length scale @xmath15 .",
    "the assumptions we made in imply that the partition function for an * * @xmath21 link chain decouples into @xmath22 factors of the * * partition function : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the out - going tangent of link vertex @xmath17 ( see ) . in the expression above ,",
    "* we have written the sum over the final tangent implicitly since we do not wish to limit ourselves to a particular dimension * both two and three dimensions are of experimental interest .",
    "we now introduce the fundamental tangent distribution function .",
    "the tangent distribution function is the conditional probability density for the final tangent , given an initial tangent .",
    "the fundamental tangent distribution function is the distribution function over just one link , length @xmath15 , and is related to the vertex energy by the boltzmann distribution ( ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath24 are the initial and final tangent respectively and the deflection angle at vertex @xmath17 is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the chain statistics of the theory are completely determined by the fundamental tangent distribution .",
    "we now introduce an explicit toy model for dna bending that differs dramatically from the wlc model .",
    "although the symbolic results below can be applied to the analysis of any of the semiflexible polymer models specified by , we will illustrate the method by using the toy model to compute experimental observables like force extension , the cyclization @xmath0 factor , etc .  for an explicit generalized theory .",
    "the model we will study has a bending energy that is softer for high curvature than the wlc model .",
    "nevertheless , it reproduces the successful long - length - scale predictions of wlc .",
    "we have already described one such model in an earlier paper @xcite and a similar model was also proposed by yan and marko @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the high curvature softening was introduced by allowing kinking , or curvature localization : beyond a critical strain , the dna s resistance to bending was supposed to fall suddenly to zero , or some small value .",
    "although these kinking models reproduced the two desired features mentioned above , they predicted that highly curved dna should be generically kinked @xcite .",
    "however , atomic force microscopy ( afm ) imaging of small minicircles generically shows them as round ( although kinking can be induced in unusual ionic conditions ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , tightly looped dna shows enhanced sensitivity to dnase digestion that is not concentrated on a single kink point , but rather is spread throughout the loop @xcite . finally , recent molecular - dynamics simulations of dna minicircles show the spontaneous formation of sharp bends without strand separation @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", this paper will explore a class of models with nonlinear dna elasticity but without the catastrophic breakdown characteristic of kinking .",
    "the bending energy functions we will study comes from the observation , well known in continuum mechanics , that a rod bending energy density that is non - convex in curvature induces kinking when the rod is strongly bent @xcite . to avoid kinking",
    ", we must therefore require that our effective bending energy density be everywhere a convex function of curvature , at least on length scales observable via electron microscopy ( em ) or afm imaging .    a simple choice of bending energy function that meets all the conditions mentioned , but is radically different from the wlc model , is : @xmath28 which defines a family of models parameterized by @xmath29 and @xmath15 that we call `` sub - elastic chain '' ( sec ) models",
    ". we will show that taking @xmath30 and @xmath31 nm gives rise to a model with the persistence length @xmath32 nm needed to describe the long - scale behavior of dna in moderate - salt solution @xcite . as a final motivation ,",
    "afm studies of the tangent - tangent correlation of dna adsorbed to mica appear to fit a bending energy of roughly this functional form @xcite .",
    "the model illustrates several of the points we wish to make . in particular , it is clear that high curvature , the bending stiffness in this model is softer than the corresponding wlc model at high deflection ( we shall show that the persistence length of , and the energy is nowhere non - convex .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that the sec model reproduces essentially the same behavior as wlc for those aspects of dna mechanics that have been well tested .",
    "* *    the reader may have several quite substantive objections to the claim that correctly describes the bending energy of dna in solution .",
    "these measurement were performed on dna , adsorbed to mica at low magnesium concentrations , then rinsed and dried before the dna conformations were scanned using an afm @xcite .",
    "it is believed that ( i ) the adsorption of dna to the mica substrate is weak enough that the chain can equilibrate on the surface and that ( ii ) the mica does not significantly affect the bending energy of the chain because the persistence length of the polymer is roughly the same as that measured in solution @xcite .",
    "there are also important limitations on the accuracy of these measurements due to the afm tip convolution , pixillation , and tracing algorithm used to extract the bending angles @xcite .",
    "another objection to the proposed model is that the energy is non - analytic at zero curvature .",
    "we wish to use these experiments only to motivate a class of models in which the bending energy becomes softer than quadratic at large deflection . for the moment , let us lay our fears aside and analyze the sec model to see what the consequences of the bending energy described by are .",
    "is this model , which is dramatically different from the wlc model on short length scales , compatible with other measurements of dna chain statistics on long length scales as suggested by renormalization group arguments ?",
    "can this type of model reproduce the anomalously high @xmath0 factor observed by cloutier and widom @xcite ? to answer these questions , the detailed form of the bending energy will not be particularly important .",
    "for instance , we could introduce a small quadratic regime to the bending energy without significantly affecting the predictions of the model or the fit to experiment . in the remainder of",
    ", we shall explicitly demonstrate that the tangent distribution function of the model approaches that predicted by the wlc model as the contour length of the chain increases .",

    "the force required to tightly bend short sections of dna has recently been directly measured by liphardt and coworkers @xcite via a fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) force sensor . in this experiment ,",
    "a sequence of dna 9.18 nm in length is tightly bent by a linking sequence of single - stranded dna as illustrated in .",
    "this contour length is represented in our theory by two links ( @xmath34 nm ) and a single vertex .",
    "the deflection angle is roughly @xmath35 .",
    "it is straightforward to estimate the deflection force in both the discrete wlc and sec models : @xmath36 ( in this estimate , we have used @xmath37 nm , half the contour length of the dsdna . )",
    "the experimentally measured force , @xmath38 pn , is approximately equal to that predicted by the model but is more than a factor of two smaller than that predicted by the elastic rod model ( wlc ) .",
    "these experiments again indicate that the wlc model fails to describe the high - curvature bending of short sequences of dna . at least at this deflection angle ,",

    "its bending energy function , however , is not meant to be a literal depiction of dna mechanics . in principle , the true bending energy function can eventually be deduced from statistical analysis of sufficiently accurate determinations of dna contours , obtained either in solution via cryo em , or when adsorbed to surfaces by afm or em .",
    "alternatively , the short - length - scale bending energy might be calculated using molecular dynamics simulations .",

    "for instance for dna looping , moving an operator ( the dna binding sequence ) a few base pairs can change the looping probability by an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this dramatic , short - contour - length dependence arises from the necessity of bring the dna operator into twist registry with the binding site .",
    "the twist degree of freedom of dna has also been described by a fluctuating elastic rod , the helical wormlike chain model ( hwlc ) @xcite . at long length scales ,",
    "this modified wlc model has successfully described the twist dependence of dna .",
    "nevertheless , at high enough strain the hwlc model breaks down .",

    "such generalized models are in principle a straightforward extension of the theory presented in this paper and new exact results for the hwlc model recently derived by spakowitz @xcite .",
