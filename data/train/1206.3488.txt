    "open dielectric cavities have attracted a large interest in recent years due to their numerous and potentially important applications @xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the crucial difference between dielectric cavities and much more investigated case of closed quantum billiards @xcite is that in the latter the spectrum is discrete but in the former it is continuous .",
    "indeed , the main subject of investigations in open systems is not the true spectrum but the spectrum of resonances defined as poles of the scattering @xmath0-matrix ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the wavelength of electromagnetic field is usually much smaller than any characteristic cavity size ( except its height ) and semiclassical techniques are useful and adequate for a theoretical approach to such objects . it is well known that the trace formulas are a very powerful tool in the semiclassical description of closed systems , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore , the generalization of trace formulas to different open systems , in particular to dielectric cavities , is of importance .",
    "the trace formula for resonances with transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarization in two - dimensional ( 2d ) dielectric cavities has been developed in @xcite and shown to agree well with the experiments and numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to the construction of the trace formula for 2d dielectric cavities but for transverse electric ( te ) polarization . due to",
    "different boundary conditions the case of te modes differs in many aspects from tm modes . in particular , a special treatment is required for the resonances related to brewster s angle @xcite at which the fresnel reflection coefficient vanishes .",
    "our main result is the asymptotic formula in the semiclassical ( aka short wave length ) regime for the average number of te resonances for a 2d dielectric cavity with refraction index @xmath1 , area @xmath2 and perimeter @xmath3 @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the mean number of resonances ( defined below ) whose real part is less than @xmath6 , the coefficient @xmath7 is given by the expression @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the fresnel reflection coefficient for the scattering on a straight dielectric interface at imaginary momentum @xmath10 the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",

    "[ sectweyl ] the first two weyl terms for the resonance counting function are derived .",
    "it is important to notice that , for te modes , one can have total transmission of a ray when the incidence angle is equal to brewster s angle .",

    "to describe a dielectric cavity correctly one should solve the @xmath11-dimensional maxwell equations .",
    "in many applications the transverse height of a cavity , say along the @xmath12 axis , is much smaller than any other cavity dimensions .",
    "in such situation the @xmath11-dimensional problem in a reasonable approximation can be reduced to two 2d scalar problems ( for each polarization of the field ) following the so - called effective index approximation , see e.g. @xcite for more details .    in the simplest",
    "setting , when one ignores the dependence of the effective index on frequency , such 2d approximation consists in using the maxwell equations for an infinite cylinder .",
    "it is well known @xcite that in this geometry the maxwell equations are reduced to two scalar helmholtz equations inside and outside the cavity @xmath13 where @xmath1 is the refractive index of the cavity , @xmath14 indicates the interior of the dielectric cavity , and @xmath15 for the tm polarization and @xmath16 for the te polarization .",
    "helmholtz equations ( [ equations ] ) have to be completed by the boundary conditions .",
    "the field , @xmath17 , is continuous across the cavity boundary and its normal derivatives along both sides of the boundary are related for two polarizations as below @xcite @xmath18 open cavities have no true discrete spectrum .",
    "instead , we are interested in the discrete resonance spectrum , which is defined as the ( complex ) poles of the @xmath0-matrix for the scattering on a cavity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the positions of the resonances can be determined directly by the solution of the problem and by imposing the outgoing boundary conditions at infinity @xmath19 the set ( [ equations])-([infinity ] ) admit complex eigen - values @xmath6 with im@xmath20 , which are the resonances of the dielectric cavity and are the main object of this paper . our goal is to count such resonances for the te polarization in the semiclassical regime .",

    "the circular dielectric cavity is the only finite 2d cavity , which permits an analytical solution .",
    "let @xmath21 be the radius of such a cavity .",

    "in fact , this equation is valid in the semiclassical limit for closed and open circular cavities with other boundary conditions as well .",

    "the last term is the new one related to the change of the sign of the te reflection coefficient .",
    "higher order terms in weyl s expansions and are not yet calculated so we prefer to use a conservative estimate of them as @xmath109 though all numerical checks suggest that for smooth boundary cavities it is @xmath110 .",
    "formula is the correct description for the resonances whose real part of the eigen - momentum @xmath6 corresponds to non - zero reflection coefficient ( i.e. @xmath111 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that when the reflection coefficient is zero its phase is not defined . for te modes",
    "there is a special branch of resonances for which semiclassically the real part does obey @xmath112 .",
    "the existence of such additional resonances were first discussed in a different context in @xcite .",
    "the approximate positions of these resonances can be calculated as follows .",
    "assume that the resonances have a large imaginary part .",
    "as @xmath113 tends to zero when @xmath114 one can approximate eq .   by @xmath115 from the asymptotic",
    "it follows that @xmath116 using this expression one concludes that the solution of the equation @xmath117 has the form @xmath118 this approximation is better for large @xmath1 when the imaginary part is large but it gives reasonable results even for @xmath1 of the order of @xmath47 . in practice one may use as the initial value for any root search algorithm ( cf .",
    "[ m_23_app ] ) .    from it follows that the ratio @xmath119 tends to @xmath98 defined in so these resonances are not taken explicitly into account in eq .",
    "( [ r_te ] ) . their number can be estimated as follows .",
    "the discussed resonances correspond to waves propagating along the boundary whose direction forms an angle with the normal exactly equal to brewster s angle @xmath120 if the length of the boundary is @xmath3 , the possible values for the momenta of such states in the semiclassical limit are @xmath121 with integer @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , the number of additional resonances related with brewster s angle is @xmath123 comparing it with eq .",
    "we conclude that the second term in the weyl expansion for the averaged number of resonances for te polarization is the following @xmath124 where the plus sign is used when the above additional resonances are taken into account and the minus sign corresponds to the case when these resonances are ignored .    for small values of @xmath1 the additional resonances are mixed with other resonances and their separation seems artificial . for large @xmath1 the additional branch of resonances is well separated from the main body of resonances and one can decide not to take them into account .",
    "in such a case , the minus sign has to be used in ( see below section  [ numerics ] ) .",
    "when the cavity remains invariant under a group of symmetry it is often convenient to split resonances according to their symmetry representations . for reflection symmetries",
    "it is equivalent to consider a smaller cavity where along parts of the boundary one has to impose either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions . in this case",
    "the total boundary contribution to the average counting function @xmath125 is given by the general formula @xmath126 here @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the lengths of the boundary parts with respectively neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions and @xmath129 is the length of the true dielectric interface .",
