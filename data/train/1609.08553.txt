    "a population of gravitationally lensed dusty star - forming galaxies ( dsfgs ) has been discovered by the south pole telescope ( spt ) survey @xcite and facilitated our understanding of the stellar , gas , and dust content of the high - redshift universe .",
    "one of the sources stands out as the most extraordinary discovered so far in the 2500 deg@xmath10 survey : spt - s j034640 - 5204.9 ( hereafter spt0346 - 52 ) at @xmath0 = 5.656 , among the highest - redshift dsfgs known .",
    "it has been the focus of a multi - wavelength observational campaign with _ hst _ , _ spitzer _ , _ herschel _ , the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) , and the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "our lens model obtained from alma 870 @xmath11 imaging shows that spt0346 - 52 is magnified by the foreground lensing galaxy ( at @xmath0 @xmath1 1.1 ) a factor of 5.6 @xmath6 0.1 with an intrinsic 870 @xmath11 flux of 19.6 @xmath6 0.5 mjy , and has an intrinsic size of @xmath12 = 0.61 @xmath6 0.03 kpc ( @xmath12 being half - light radius ; @xcite ) .",
    "multi - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting gives an intrinsic infrared ( ir ; 8 - 1000@xmath13 ) luminosity @xmath14 of ( 3.6 @xmath6 0.3 ) @xmath7 10@xmath8 @xmath9 and a star formation rate ( sfr ) of 4500 @xmath6 1000 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 @xcite . given its size , spt0346 - 52 turns out to have one of the highest ir luminosity surface density and sfr surface density @xmath4 of any known galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the central question is whether this high luminosity surface density arises solely from intense star formation , or if there is an obscured active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the dust temperature of spt0346 - 52 , 52.4 @xmath6 2.2 k @xcite , is higher than that of typical dsfgs and reaches into the territory of agn - dominated sources ( figure [ fig : lciilfir_td ] ) .",
    "spt0346 - 52 has an @xmath15}$]/@xmath16 ratio consistent with fir - luminous quasars at @xmath0 @xmath1 6 and also shows an @xmath15}$ ] deficit relative to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which has been observed in agn - dominated sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "it shows strong h@xmath18o emission lines @xcite similar to that of the strongly lensed quasars h1413 + 1143 and apm 08279 + 5255 @xcite .",
    "spt0346 - 52 is also optically obscured and does not show any indications of type-1 or type-2 agn in deep vlt optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "dsfgs are in a unique phase of galaxy formation and evolution where the assembly of the stellar and supermassive black hole ( smbh ) masses are believed to be closely coupled @xcite . to test if hosts an agn and determine whether it is star formation - dominated or agn - dominated , we resort to _ chandra_. hard x - ray emission ( rest - frame energies @xmath19 2 kev ) is the best indicator of agn activity . these high - energy photons can penetrate through heavy obscuration , revealing the signature of the accreting black hole . a significant fraction of x - ray detected dsfgs",
    "have been found to be agn - dominated in the x - ray , while some are powered by pure star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations of the well - studied dsfg samples from the alma laboca e - cdf - s submillimeter survey ( aless ; @xcite ) reveal that 17% of dsfgs appear to host an agn .",
    "we here compare spt0346 - 52 with these dsfgs and starbursts and quasars in the literature to understand the nature of the most extraordinary source found so far in the spt survey .",
    "in addition to x - ray , radio also can be used to distinguish star - forming galaxies from agn .",
    "radio continuum emission from galaxies arises due to both thermal and non - thermal processes in massive star formation .",
    "these same massive stars also provide the primary sources of dust heating in the interstellar medium and the fir emission is primarily due to the re - emitted starlight by dust .",
    "star - forming galaxies that are not radio - loud agn are observed to follow a tight fir - to - radio correlation that holds over five orders of magnitude in galaxy luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in contrast , radio - loud agn will exhibit elevated radio emission above this relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we utilize the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to probe the radio continuum emission of spt0346 - 52 to examine whether or not it is consistent with the fir - to - radio correlation .    in this paper , we present the results from x - ray observations with the _ chandra _ observatory and radio continuum observations with atca to constrain the agn activity , in combination with our existing multi - wavelength data .",
    "the galactic column density towards is @xmath20 = 1.8 @xmath7 10@xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "we assume a @xmath23cdm cosmology with @xmath24 = 69.3 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath25 = 0.286 , and @xmath26 = 0.713 ( wmap9 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt the definition of @xmath14 to be integrated over rest - frame 8 - 1000 @xmath11 and @xmath16 integrated over rest - frame 42.5 - 122.5 @xmath11 .",
    "we assume a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) throughout the paper .",
    "we present the new _ chandra _ x - ray and atca radio continuum data for spt0346 - 52 in this section .",

    ".multi - wavelength observed flux densities in mjy . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : chandra ]      spt0346 - 52",
    "was observed with atca for 3960s at 5.5 and 9.0 ghz and 4068s at 2.1 ghz on 2012 january 25 in the 6a array configuration using the cabb in the 1m-0.5k mode .",
    "the data was reduced in the same manner as in @xcite .",
    "the resultant synthesized beam sizes are 7.7@xmath27 @xmath7 5.2@xmath27 at 2.1 ghz , 3.3@xmath27 @xmath7 2.2@xmath27 at 5.5 ghz and 2.1@xmath27 @xmath7 1.3@xmath27 at 9.0 ghz .",
    "the continuum was not detected in any band and we place 3 @xmath28 upper limits ( i.e. , 3 @xmath7 rms noise values calculated within a 1@xmath29 region around the source position ) of 0.213 mjy at 2.1 ghz , 0.114 mjy at 5.5 ghz and 0.138 mjy at 9.0 ghz on the radio emission from the source .",
    "we place spt0346 - 52 on the @xmath16-@xmath30 plane ( ) in the context of x - ray quasars and starburst galaxies .",
    "there , we compare it with other smgs that are identified as smg - agn or smg - starbursts to determine if it is star formation - dominated or agn - dominated .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : lfir_lx ] , the starburst galaxies ( squares labeled with ` s ' ) from the literature occupy different locations than agn - dominated galaxies ( squares labeled with ` a ' ) and quasars ( dashed line and the gray region ) .",
    "the well - studied unobscured quasars of @xcite provide the fiducial x - ray to fir luminosity ratios ( the median ratio is @xmath30/@xmath16 = 0.05 and the gray region indicates the standard deviation ) for agn - dominated sources .",
    "the luminosity ratio for pure starburst galaxies is about two orders of magnitude lower .    for smgs , which may involve the co - evolution of super massive black holes and the host galaxies , a heterogeneous population has been observed . the dividing line between starbursts and agn is typically taken to be @xmath30/@xmath16 @xmath1 0.004 @xcite .",
    "the extensively studied aless smgs from @xcite are consistent with this notion .",
    "the x - ray to fir ratio upper limit for spt0346 - 52 is 0.0038 , slightly leftward of the dividing line , which indicates that it is consistent with being starburst - dominated in the x - ray .",
    "one caveat is that if the absorption for spt0346 - 52 is exceptionally high , the x - ray upper limit could be weakened .",
    "for example , if @xmath31 is 4 times higher ( the highest @xmath31 for aless smgs ) than what we adopted , the upper limit will be 1.3 times higher , which would move the limit slightly to the right of the dividing line between starbursts and agn in figure [ fig : lfir_lx ] .",
    "for this reason , we also can not exclude compton thick agn by @xmath16-@xmath30 alone ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the second potential caveat is agn x - ray variability . using the relation between x - ray luminosity and variability found by @xcite , the fractional variability of",
    "is expected to be 30% .",
    "a third potential caveat is the possibility of differential magnification between the star formation region and the agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have assumed a constant magnification of @xmath32 = 5.6",
    ". it could be that the star formation region is more magnified than the agn .",
    "the maximum difference in magnification between components of this galaxy found by @xcite is @xmath33 @xmath1 2 , which would move the red upper limit in figure [ fig : lfir_lx ] by the same amount .",
    "however , without a robust x - ray detection and resolved x - ray image of the system , it is impossible to say any more .    if we adopt @xmath30/@xmath16 = 0.05 for typical quasars and take the ratio ( @xmath30/@xmath16)@xmath34/(@xmath30/@xmath16)@xmath35 following @xcite , the agn fractional contribution to the fir luminosity is estimated to be at most 8% .",
    "we note that an agn in spt0346 - 52 would be fainter than the quasars studied by @xcite , and that seyfert 1 galaxies tend to be relatively more x - ray luminous than quasars .",
    "using the extensive seyfert observations of @xcite would shift the grey band in figure [ fig : lfir_lx ] ( and agn / starburst boundary ) to the right by a factor of a few .",
    "this would mean that the fir contribution of any agn in would be even smaller than our upper limit of 8% .",
    "although we can not completely rule out the presence of an agn in the system , it is certainly the star - formation that is dominating the fir emission , which is confirmed by fitting spectral energy distributions including an agn component in section [ sec : sedfitting ] .",
    "we previously performed sed fitting on with cigale fortran assuming no agn contribution in the ir @xcite , which is consistent with the nir photometric upper limits and fir detections .",
    "now we employ cigale python @xcite , which includes up - to - date star formation history models , stellar population synthesis models , ir re - emission models , and agn templates , to constrain the potential agn contribution in the ir .",
    "the photometric data points used in the sed fitting are listed in table [ tab : summary ] .",
    "we adopt a @xcite imf and the @xcite stellar population synthesis models . for star formation history , we assume a delayed-@xmath36 model which rises at early ages and then declines exponentially . this form of star formation history is generally expected for especially high - redshift galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use a combination of @xcite ir models accounting for the dust emission from the stellar component and @xcite agn templates .",
    "the @xcite agn models take into account two emission components associated with the agn : a power - law from the central source and the thermal and scattering dust - torus emission .",
    "the relative normalization of these components is handled through a parameter , fracagn , which is the fractional contribution of the agn to the total ir luminosity ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the model curve is also extended to radio wavelengths .",
    "the extension relies on the well - established fir - to - radio correlation for star - forming galaxies .",
    "cigale does not include synchrotron emission from agn .",
    "a pure starburst sed remains the best - fit sed ( i.e. , with the minimal reduced @xmath38 ) , constrained by all the photometric detections and upper limits from nir to radio wavelengths ( figure [ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "parameters are analyzed under a bayesian approach generating a posterior probability distribution function .",
    "the sed fitting failed to tightly constrain fracagn given the lack of mid - ir photometric points ( which differentiate between agn and star - forming galaxies ) and the loose constraint from the nir .",
    "the posterior probability distribution suggests that the agn component contributes at most @xmath120% to the total ir luminosity , with the highest probability being assigned to a contribution of 0 - 5% .",
    "this is consistent with the estimation from the @xmath30/@xmath16 ratio in section [ sec : lx_lfir ] .",
    "the model sed with the maximum 20% agn fraction is also plotted in figure [ fig : sed ] , which is inconsistent with the 100 @xmath11 herschel / pacs upper limit .",
    "the atca radio continuum upper limits at 2.1 ghz and 5.5 ghz are consistent with the fir - to - radio correlation for star - forming galaxies",
    ". the radio part of the sed for radio - loud agn would be at least a factor of @xmath1 2 higher ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have provided evidence that spt0346 - 52 is star formation - dominated in the ir . since our sfr is mainly constrained by the fir photometric data , @xmath14 being almost all from star formation suggests that the inferred sfr reflects the true sfr .",
    "we examine whether this observed high sfr can be physically explained in the framework of  maximum \" starbursts @xcite where a substantial fraction @xmath39 of available gas is consumed to make stars . following @xcite , the maximum (  schmidt - law \" ) sfr",
    "can be written as @xmath40    where @xcite defines @xmath39 as the star formation efficiency , @xmath41 is the gas fraction , @xmath42 is the total ( dynamical ) mass of the system , @xmath43 is the dynamical time , and @xmath44 is the circular velocity in km s@xmath3 .",
    "we use the definition in @xcite , @xmath44 = 0.67@xmath7@xmath45 = 410 km s@xmath3 ( @xmath45 = 613 @xmath6 30 km s@xmath3 measured from the low - j co(2 - 1 ) line ; @xcite ) . assuming a gas fraction of 0.3 - 0.8 , we utilize the observed sfr of 3600 @xmath6 300 @xmath46 using the @xcite conversion factor assuming a @xcite imf where sfr = 1.0 @xmath7 10@xmath47 @xmath14 ( @xmath9 ) . ] to derive @xmath39 , which turns out to be in the range of 0.3 - 0.7 .",
    "this range is higher than the typical star formation efficiency ( 0.15 - 0.2 ) observed in dsfgs @xcite .",
    "we further examine the sfr surface density @xmath48 expected from this framework .",
    "@xmath49    where @xmath50 is the total ( dynamical ) mass density within radius @xmath51 , in units of @xmath2 pc@xmath52 . for spt0346 - 52 , @xmath51 = 1.8 @xmath6 0.2 kpc and @xmath42 = ( 1.5 @xmath6 0.2 )",
    "@xmath7 10@xmath53 @xmath2 , derived in a spatially resolved co imaging study by @xcite . the observed @xmath4 = 1540 @xmath6 130 @xmath5 , from the dust emission .",
    "] in which the dust emission ( i.e. , the stellar emission reprocessed by dust ) is distributed in a compact area with an effective radius of 0.61 @xmath6 0.03 kpc , surpasses the theoretical @xmath48 by at least a factor of @xmath1 2 .",
    "it is one of the highest star formation densities of any known galaxy in the universe ( @xcite ) , although the nuclei of arp 220 have @xmath4 @xmath110@xmath54 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : size ] shows how spt0346 - 52 compares in sfr surface density to other starburst galaxies ( black ) and starbursts found in quasar host galaxies ( green ) at @xmath0 @xmath19 3 in the literature . spt0346 - 52 has an order of magnitude higher sfr than most other sources that lie within a factor of a few in star formation surface density . spt0346 - 52 stands out as the most extreme source at high redshift .",
    "if the starburst is supported by radiation pressure on dust grains in a disk , @xmath14 is consistent with the eddington - limited luminosity but the sfr surface density is above the @xmath1 1000 @xmath5 theoretical limit by @xcite .",
    "the eddington limit depends upon opacity , and the observed sfr for spt0346 - 52 lies in between the sfr@xmath55 for the optically thin limit and sfr@xmath56 for the optically thick limit from @xcite . the observed brightness temperature ( @xmath1 50 k ) is comparable to the dust temperature , which suggests that the gas may be approaching the optically thick regime ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the star formation activity in this source , while very vigorous , may still be sub - eddington .",
    "it is natural to suspect that the radiation pressure would drive outflows of cold dusty gas , which have been commonly observed from starbursting galaxies including ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sfe ] demonstrates the allowed @xmath39 and @xmath57 in the theoretical framework of  maximum starbursts \" .",
    "this observed extremely high @xmath4 may be explained by an especially high star formation efficiency ( @xmath39 @xmath19 0.4 ) relative to what has been observed in dsfgs .",
    "the gas fraction is constrained to be at least 40% .",
    "so far we have only detected a handful of dsfgs at @xmath0 @xmath19 5 , only a few hundred million years from the big bang ( @xcite ) .",
    "these sources are expected to harbor larger gas reservoirs available for star formation and be able to sustain a more elevated star formation efficiency than typical dsfgs @xcite .",
    "gas fractions of spt dsfgs derived using low - j co observations are in the range of 0.3 - 0.8 @xcite .",
    "bothwell et al . in preparation found that spt dsfgs ( spt0346 - 52 is not in this sample ) on average have very high gas fractions ( @xmath57 @xmath1 0.6 - 0.8 ) based on atomic carbon observations .",
    "the very high gas fractions could raise the @xmath4 without invoking extremely high star formation efficiency .",
    "emission from spt0346 - 52 has proved to be beyond the reach of our existing _ hst _ and _ spitzer _ data @xcite , which has prevented a detailed characterization of the established stellar mass .",
