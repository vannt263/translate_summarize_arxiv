    "isospin violation @xcite has recently been investigated in the context of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath2pt ) .",
    "this powerful technique @xcite casts the symmetries of qcd into effective lagrangians that are expressed in terms of pions and nucleons , which are the effective degrees of freedom of nuclear physics .",
    "these lagrangian building blocks can then be combined in a systematic way to develop isospin - violating forces . although most of the forces resulting from this procedure were anticipated and developed using phenomenological methods , new forces have also been found .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to complement the earlier work on isospin - violating two - nucleon @xcite forces by calculating the leading - order three - nucleon isospin - violating force , which breaks charge symmetry .",
    "in addition , we estimate the contribution of this force to the @xmath0he  @xmath0h binding - energy difference .",
    "this is the first such calculation of isospin - violating three - nucleon forces and completes the @xmath2pt calculations of isospin violation both charge - independence breaking ( cib ) and charge - symmetry breaking ( csb) through the first three orders .",
    "chiral perturbation theory is organized around power counting ( dimensional analysis @xcite ) , which allows estimates of the sizes of various mechanisms to be made in terms of the parameters and scales intrinsic to qcd . these scales",
    "( using weinberg power counting @xcite ) include the pion decay constant , @xmath3 93 mev , which sets the scale for pion emission or absorption , the pion mass , @xmath4 , which sets the scale for chiral - symmetry breaking , the typical nucleon momentum , @xmath5 ( which also determines the inverse correlation length in nuclei ) , and the characteristic qcd bound - state scale , @xmath6 , which is appropriate for heavy mesons , nucleon resonances , etc .",
    "the latter states are frozen out and do not explicitly appear in @xmath2pt , although their effect is present in the counter terms of the effective interactions .",
    "the resulting field theory is a power series in @xmath7 , and the number of implicit powers of @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xmath9 ) can be used to label individual terms in the lagrangian ( viz . , @xmath10 ) .",
    "in this way higher powers denote smaller terms , and this is a critical part of the organizing principle of @xmath2pt .",
    "we note that power - counting estimates of sizes are typically within a factor of 2 - 3 of the actual sizes .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon correlation - length scale is not relevant for one - body operators , occurs once for two - body operators , twice for three - body operators , etc .",
    "thus it is important to incorporate this mechanism into the power counting if we wish to compare mechanisms with differing numbers of interacting nucleons .",
    "in addition to adding the indexes `` @xmath9 '' for each of the individual lagrangians ( see above ) that are used in a given calculation , we must add 2 for each loop and @xmath11 - 1 for an @xmath11-body feynman diagram in order to determine the effective order @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thus three - nucleon forces with an order determined by an index @xmath13 should be comparable in size in nuclei to one - body operators ( such as the kinetic energy ) corresponding to an index @xmath9 , or a two - body force corresponding to an index @xmath14 .",
    "( notice that this accounting of the relative sizes of few - body forces is different from weinberg s @xcite by one order , which reflects the fact that we are counting the nucleon mass @xmath15 as @xmath16 , rather than @xmath17 . )",
    "this is the underlying reason why @xmath11-body forces in nuclei get systematically smaller as @xmath11 increases ( and this makes nuclear physics tractable ) .",
    "isospin violation in nuclei arises from three distinct mechanisms .",
    "the first is the up - down quark - mass difference , which dominates and makes the neutron heavier than the proton .",
    "the second mechanism is hard electromagnetic ( em ) interactions at the quark level , which tries to make the proton heavier than the neutron .",
    "this is also the mechanism that produces most of the pion - mass difference .",
    "the final mechanisms are the soft - photon interactions ( such as the coulomb interaction between protons ) that dominate isospin violation in nuclei .",
    "direct comparison @xcite of the sizes of the em and quark - mass terms demonstrates that the em terms ( which contain a factor of @xmath18 , the fine - structure constant ) are roughly the same size as quark - mass terms that are formally three orders smaller in the power counting .",
    "we adjust our power counting accordingly and adopt the convenient mnemonic of adding 3 to the order of the em - induced isospin - violating lagrangian when comparing sizes with quark - mass - induced mechanisms . henceforth our power counting for any em - induced interactions will contain this additional factor of 3 .",
    "our prior work on isospin - violating nucleon - nucleon forces ( both csb and cib ) in the context of chiral perturbation theory with the @xmath12-isobar integrated out @xcite identified the leading mechanisms for isospin violation in nuclei . in the next section",
    "we discuss their impact on the @xmath0he  @xmath0h binding - energy difference . in the following section we calculate the leading isospin - violating three - nucleon force and",
    "evaluate its contribution to @xmath0he  @xmath0h binding - energy difference",
    ". we then conclude .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the following ten mechanisms are expected to contribute dominantly to csb in nuclei :    @xmath19 the mass difference of the proton and neutron , @xmath20    @xmath19 the csb nuclear kinetic energy    @xmath19 the coulomb potential between protons    @xmath19 the breit - interaction ( @xmath21 ) corrections to the coulomb potential    @xmath19 the csb one - pion - exchange potential ( opep )    @xmath19 the csb short - range nuclear potential    @xmath19 the csb two - pion - exchange potential incorporating the nucleon - mass difference    @xmath19 the class iv csb interactions ( anti - symmetric in isospin coordinates and with a spin - orbit - type spin - space dependence )    @xmath19 an opep with class iv isospin structure that vanishes in the two - nucleon center - of - mass , but not in a three - nucleon system    @xmath19 a two - pion - exchange three - nucleon force proportional to the quark - mass - difference contribution , @xmath22 , to the nucleon - mass difference    we will briefly discuss each of them in turn in the context of the @xmath0he  @xmath0h binding - energy difference .",
    "the first four mechanisms are fairly well - known .",
    "they include the two largest mechanisms , and we start our discussion with them .",
    "the mass ( rest - energy ) difference of the nucleons , @xmath23 , contributes to the @xmath2pt lagrangian at order @xmath24 . from a nuclear - physics perspective it makes an uninteresting contribution to the mass difference of @xmath0he and @xmath0h and",
    "is conventionally removed , leaving only a binding - energy difference .",
    "although @xmath0h is heavier than @xmath0he , this removal leads to @xmath0he being less bound than @xmath0h by 764 kev , which is the target for all csb calculations in the three - nucleon systems .",
    "the nucleon - mass difference nevertheless plays a non - trivial role in intermediate states where two protons are converted to two neutrons ( or _ vice versa _ ) by exchanging pions .",
    "that effect was recently treated in a systematic fashion @xcite by removing the @xmath23 mass - difference term from the @xmath2pt lagrangian .",
    "this removes @xmath23 from asymptotic states and nuclear energies , but its effect in intermediate states is compensated by the addition of new terms in the lagrangian that must be incorporated in any calculations .",
    "the resulting scheme is much simpler to use than older techniques , and we will use it below .",
    "the kinetic - energy difference between two protons and two neutrons caused by their different masses corresponds to @xmath25 in power counting . in the trinucleon systems this mechanism leads to a robust 14  kev contribution @xcite to the binding - energy difference of @xmath0he and @xmath0h .",
    "the coulomb potential between two protons is the dominant csb interaction in nuclei . according to the way we bookkeep em interactions this is an effect one order down compared to the leading , isospin - conserving nucleon - nucleon force , so it is effectively an @xmath24 , or @xmath26 , term .",
    "this contribution has a nominal size in terms of scales given by @xmath27 1  mev , where @xmath18 is the fine - structure constant . in the trinucleon systems",
    "it has been well studied over several decades and leads to a robust and dominant 648  kev contribution to the 764  kev trinucleon binding - energy difference @xcite .",
    "small em contributions of relativistic order contained in the breit interaction ( viz . , the interaction between nucleon magnetic moments and between the currents associated with moving protons ) plus a smaller vacuum - polarization force appear two orders down ( @xmath25 or @xmath28 in our power counting ) . in terms of scales",
    "the relativistic contributions behave like @xmath29 25  kev . indeed , they lead to a robust @xcite 28  kev .",
    "the effect of csb on two - nucleon potentials is subsumed by the next four mechanisms on the list above , of which three are class iii and one is class iv .",
    "we will discuss them separately .",
    "charge - symmetry breaking in the pion - nucleon coupling constants can lead to a csb opep that has nominal size @xmath30 , which corresponds to @xmath31 .",
    "only an upper limit of size 50  kev ( with unknown sign ) constrains this mechanism @xcite .",
    "a conventional short - range interaction of undetermined strength corresponding to size @xmath31 ( and a nominal size of roughly 50  kev ) is also present @xcite .",
    "the last of the three class iii mechanisms is the recently calculated two - pion - exchange potential that incorporates various aspects of the nucleon - mass difference .",
    "it is of nominal order @xmath25 or @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "each of these three mechanisms contributes to the difference between the pp force ( with the em interaction removed ) and the nn force . at present",
    "the only experimental information on this difference is contained in the scattering - length difference .",
    "the resulting @xmath33 scattering - length difference @xcite of @xmath341.5(5 ) fm is then attributed to csb in the three forces discussed above , which can not be further disentangled at the present time .",
    "( of course , in principle these mechanisms could be separated thanks to their different ranges , provided that the nucleon - nucleon data is accurate enough . )",
    "this difference then produces a contribution to the @xmath0he  @xmath0h binding - energy difference of approximately 65(22 ) kev , a number that also appears to be robust@xcite .",
    "the class iv two - nucleon csb opep @xcite has a nominal @xmath30 or @xmath31 size , which is suppressed by nearly an order of magnitude by nature s fine tuning of @xmath23 to its physical value @xcite .",
    "this type of force is further suppressed in the trinucleon bound states because s - wave components of the wave function do not contribute to a spin - orbit force .",
    "although this force and a short - range force of order @xmath35 are formally part of the the csb two - nucleon potential , they make a negligible contribution to the trinucleon binding - energy difference .",
    "the last two mechanisms are three - body effects .",
    "the recent study @xcite of class iv csb forces found a peculiar two - body force that vanishes in the center - of - mass of two nucleons , but does not vanish in a system of more than two nucleons .",
    "although nominally of order @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 ) , this force should be much smaller than that for three reasons .",
    "the first reason is that this two - body force is constrained by kinematics to vanish in the center - of - mass of those two nucleons .",
    "in addition , this force is proportional to @xmath23 , which results from the cancellation of the separate quark - mass and em contributions and has been fine - tuned by nature to a rather small value ( a factor of 5 smaller than the nominal value of the power - counting estimate for the quark - mass part @xmath22 of that mass difference , viz . , @xmath347 mev ) .",
    "the final suppression is caused by approximate su(4 ) symmetry in the few - nucleon systems .",
    "the spin - isospin dependence of the force is antisymmetric under the interchange of those coordinates for the two nucleons , caused by a @xmath36 type of isospin dependence .",
    "the dominant component of the trinucleon wave function ( @xmath37 90% ) is the s - state ( an su(4 ) classification ) , which is completely antisymmetric under that interchange .",
    "these symmetry considerations cause the diagonal s - state matrix element of the force to vanish .",
    "the net result of these suppressions is that this force should be much smaller than its nominal order indicates ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) and is therefore very unlikely to be significant .",
    "the remaining force is a three - nucleon force of nominal order @xmath24 or @xmath38 that originates in the chiral - symmetry - breaking properties of the quark - mass difference .",
    "it has never before been calculated , and we turn to it in the next section .",
    "in this section we examine isospin - violating three - nucleon forces within chiral perturbation theory .",
    "isospin - conserving three - nucleon forces have been derived within this approach in refs .",
    "we follow the same method here . in particular , we ignore terms that cancel against recoil in the iteration of the two - nucleon potential .    the field redefinition that we employed in ref .",
    "@xcite eliminated the nucleon - mass difference in the free lagrangian at the cost of additional effective interactions proportional to powers of that mass difference .",
    "only lagrangian terms that had explicit time derivatives generated additional terms . incorporating the results of that field redefinition through orders @xmath39 and @xmath24 in the lagrangian ( including short - range two- and three - body terms ) plus several other terms from ref .",
    "@xcite leads to the following terms that contribute to isospin - violating three - nucleon forces at orders @xmath24 ( csb ) and @xmath30 ( cib ) , plus omitted terms that would contribute only to higher orders : @xmath40",

    "we will focus here on the first term , which is the largest of all ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "@xcite leads to the following three - nucleon force corresponding to @xmath31 .",
    "we define the total three - nucleon force @xmath42 as @xmath43 where the subscript refers to the number of the nucleon that emits both pions ( the other two nucleons each absorb one of those pions ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the expressions @xmath44 are symmetric under the interchange of nucleons @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we then find that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the isospin operator for nucleon @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the spin operator for nucleon @xmath49 , @xmath51 is the vector from nucleon @xmath45 to nucleon @xmath49 , @xmath52 @xmath53 is the axial - vector constant , and @xmath22 is the currently unknown quark - mass portion of the nucleon - mass difference .",
    "the three - nucleon force in eqs . ( [ eqno(3)],[eqno(4 ) ] ) is charge - symmetry breaking .",
    "it is remarkable that this force appears formally at the same order as the leading isospin - conserving three - nucleon force @xcite in the theory without an explicit @xmath12-isobar .",
    "that is , the factors of @xmath54 and @xmath16 are the same in both isospin - conserving and csb three - nucleon forces although , of course , the csb force is down by a factor of @xmath55 .",
    "csb is thus relatively large among three - nucleon effects , an unusual phenomenon .",
    "it is agreed that three - nucleon effects ( those not fixed by two - nucleon data ) provide about 1 mev of the three - nucleon binding energies .",
    "the leading three - nucleon forces contain relatively large sub - leading interactions ( due to effects of the @xmath12-isobar ) , perhaps by a factor of 3 or so . combining this with a factor of @xmath56",
    ", we could expect the csb force to contribute as much as 100 kev to the three - nucleon binding - energy difference .",
    "indeed , using the replacement @xmath57 ( which is strictly valid only if the goldberger - treiman @xcite relation is exact , that is , to lowest order ) , eq .",
    "( [ eqno(4 ) ] ) can be written as @xmath58 times a dimensionless function of coordinates ( in units of @xmath59 ) , spins , and isospins .",
    "assuming that the matrix elements of this function give numbers of order 1 and that @xmath60 has its naive - dimensional - analysis value of @xmath347 mev , we arrive at 50 kev as an estimate for the size of the csb three - nucleon force .",
    "this is significant , but obviously it could differ from the actual value by a factor of a few .",
    "the two sources of uncertainty in the size of this force are the values of @xmath22 and of the dimensionless function above .    in order to better estimate the size of this csb three - nucleon force ,",
    "we have implemented it in our faddeev codes .",

    "it has been suggested @xcite that it could be extracted from pion - production experiments @xcite , but it is unclear if this can be achieved in the near future .",
    "it is likely to be smaller by a factor of a few than the naive estimate , so @xmath347 mev is to be viewed as an overestimate . using @xmath342.5 mev for @xmath22 , the contribution of our three - nucleon force",

    "the coulomb interaction and associated ( relativistic ) breit - interaction corrections dominate , while the csb kinetic - energy difference ( k.e . ) , the sum of the short - range two - body csb force mechanisms , and the three - nucleon csb force ( calculated here for the first time ) all make significant contributions .",

    "these forces are transparently easy to implement , and we refrain from writing explicit forms .",
    "they correspond to @xmath30 or @xmath69 .    at the same sub - leading order",

    "[ fig3 ] . while in flight between two nucleons ,",
    "a charged pion can exchange a photon with the third nucleon .",
    "the photon couples either _ i ) _ to the charge of the nucleon and the energy of the pion , which in the nuclear environment is @xmath70 , or _",
    "ii ) _ through the momentum of the pion and the magnetic moment of the nucleon , which is a @xmath71 effect contained in the sub - leading lagrangian @xmath66 . in addition , there can be simultaneous emission of a photon and a charged pion by one nucleon followed by their absorption on two other nucleons .",
    "this can happen when the photon couples _ i ) _ to the pion - nucleon vertex through the gauging of the axial - vector coupling ( third term in eq .",

    "they break both charge independence and charge symmetry .",
    "notice that they are entirely determined by gauge and galilean invariance in terms of known parameters ( the axial - vector coupling of the pion , the pion charge , the nucleon charge and magnetic moment , and the pion and nucleon masses ) .",
    "effects from integrated - out resonances ( most importantly the @xmath12-isobar ) only appear one further order up .",
    "a subset of these em effects has been calculated before @xcite .",
    "we expect that these uncalculated parts of the csb force corresponding to higher orders in the power counting contribute only a few kev or less , which is roughly the level of uncertainty in the em corrections discussed above .",

    "( [ eqno(3 ) ] , [ eqno(4 ) ] ) .",
    "this force is charge - symmetry breaking and appears formally at the same order as the leading isospin - conserving three - nucleon force .",
    "csb could thus be a relatively large three - nucleon effect .",
    "its strength depends on @xmath74 , the contribution from the quark - mass difference to the nucleon - mass difference .",
    "we therefore can directly tie qcd to a three - nucleon effect .",
    "unfortunately the actual value of @xmath22 has not yet been determined in a model - independent way from low - energy data , nor from lattice qcd .",

    "( [ eqno(5 ) ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath64 mev for illustration , we find that 5 kev can be attributed to this force .",
    "this value is the same sign as the observed difference , and is somewhat smaller in magnitude than expected from naive dimensional analysis . as a consequence",
