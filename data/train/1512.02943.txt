    "the galactic center is of utmost interest owing to the presence of the central supermassive black hole sagittarius a * ( sgr  a * ) , the closest supermassive bh ( smbh ) , at a distance of 8.5  kpc with a mass of @xmath7 .",
    "clearly , the identification of the radio source sgr  a * ( and similar objects in other galaxies ) with a black hole is solely based on the fact that it is difficult to consistently associate the bulk of observational data with other astronomical objects @xcite . to make indirect experiments scientifically rigorous and compelling , sufficient completeness , consistency , and uniqueness of a large amount of observational data are required @xcite .    in the case of black holes ,",
    "the definitive experiment is the discovery of the event horizon , which simultaneously is an important test of einstein s general relativity ( gr ) in the strong - field regime .",
    "the discovery of the event horizon of the central galactic bh will possibly happen already in this decade .",
    "the smbh sgr  a * qualifies as a `` dormant '' quasar due to the low current activity across practically all the electromagnetic spectrum except the radio band .",
    "the low luminosity of sgr  a * additionally complicates its study . in the optical band ,",
    "the galactic center region is unavailable for observations due to the high optical depth caused by light scattering and absorption by the interstellar dust ( mostly consisting of carbon ) in the galactic disk .",
    "nevertheless , the dust turns out to be sufficiently transparent in the near infrared ( ir ) band inside the so - called baade window , at the edge of which the galactic center is located . due to this lucky fact ,",
    "observations of sgr  a * and its surroundings by ground - based telescopes are possible .",
    "the galactic center is also observed in the radio , x - ray , and gamma - ray bands . in the near - ir band , as well as in x - rays ,",
    "sgr  a * shows up as a transient source with rare outbursts ; in gamma - rays , the galactic center has not yet been reliably identified .",
    "the mean bolometric luminosity of sgr  a * is @xmath8  erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "various models have been elaborated to interpret the observed emission from sgr  a * ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the measurement of the mass of the supermassive black hole in the galactic center with a record high accuracy up to 10% is an important scientific achievement of the 21st century .",
    "it was made possible thanks to the analysis of multi - year ir observations of the high - velocity s0 stars that move around sgr  a * in eccentric orbits @xcite .",
    "the s0 - 2 star moving around the bh in an orbit with the eccentricity @xmath10 , major semi - axis @xmath11  mpc , orbital period @xmath12  yrs , and periastron velocity @xmath13  km  s@xmath9 is studied best .",
    "the highest velocity @xmath14  km  s@xmath9 , is observed for the s0 - 16 star .",
    "the star s0 - 102 has the shortest orbital period , @xmath15  yrs .    measurement of the keplerian orbital parameters of the s0 stars over more than 20 years allowed the first precise determination of the mass of sgr  a * : @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the stars s0 - 2 and s0 - 16 have been observed over more than one orbital period , which will further improve the black hole mass measurement .",
    "relativistic post - newtonian effects in the motion of the known s0 stars are small and can not be measured yet @xcite . however",
    ", the discovery of even faster s0 stars in the galactic center is quite possible . of great interest would be the detection of a pulsar moving around the bh sgr  a * in a short - period orbit .",
    "the mass and angular momentum of the galactic central bh can be inferred from observations of quasiperiodic oscillations .",
    "this method is applicable due to the relatively low luminosity of sgr  a * , at which the plasma surrounding the bh is transparent down to the event horizon .",
    "hot spots in the inner accretion disk or hot plasma blobs in nonequatorial orbits around the bh could produce such quasiperiodic oscillations .",
    "the signal from these hot blobs should be modulated with two characteristic frequencies : the rotational frequency of the bh event horizon and the frequency of latitudinal oscillations of the blob orbit .",
    "neither of these frequencies depends on the accretion model , and both are fully determined by the bh gravitational field .",
    "the interpretation of the quasiperiodic oscillations observed from the galactic supermassive bh in the x - ray and ir bands by the two characteristic frequency methods yields the most exact estimate of the mass @xmath3 and the spin @xmath4 ( kerr parameter ) of sgr  a * : @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "another fundamental problem discussed with regard to the central bh is the nature of dark matter , which is a major astrophysical enigma .",
    "if dark matter consists of elementary particles that can annihilate or decay , gamma - ray emission can be generated .",
    "currently , an extensive search for gamma - ray emission from dark matter is being carried out by the fermi - lat ( fermi large area telescope ) gamma - ray telescope .",
    "the galactic center is one of the most suitable sites to search for dark mater signals , despite the presence of strong backgrounds from the galactic disk .",
    "analytic models and numerical simulations of the dark mater halo suggest that the halo density strongly increases toward the center .",
    "therefore , the annihilation signal from the galactic center is expected to be quite significant @xcite .",
    "in addition , the formation of an additional dark matter peak around the central supermassive bh is predicted , which should appear as a bright point - like source in gamma rays .",
    "the fermi - lat space telescope reported an intriguing gamma - ray excess from the galactic center with an angular size of several degrees , which can not be explained by usual astrophysical sources but could be due to dark matter annihilation @xcite .",
    "this result is still unreliable and requires additional checks .",
    "presently , the search for the annihilation dark matter gamma rays is one of the `` hot '' points in astrophysics .",
    "the problem could be solved by the planned russian gamma-400 gamma - ray space observatory @xcite .",
    "without a doubt , great galactographic discoveries will be made in the 21st century primarily due to gr tests in the natural physical laboratory at the galactic center .",
    "possibly , already in the next decade , the event horizon of the sgr  a * bh will be discovered . with the mass @xmath17 ,",
    "the linear size of the bh event horizon in the case of extremely rapid spin is @xmath18  cm , which is about nine solar radii . from the distance @xmath19  kpc to the galactic center",
    ", an object of this size would have the angular diameter @xmath20 . to resolve it , an instrument with an angular resolution of a few micro arc seconds",
    "is needed .",
    "currently , only very long baseline radio interferometry ( vlbi ) in the millimeter and submillimeter bands enables the necessary micro - arcsecond resolution .    since 2007 , a substantial international collaboration has worked out the project called the event horizon telescope ( eht ) , which is primarily aimed at identifying the event horizon of the supermassive bh in the galactic center .",
    "the next prospective candidate is the smbh at the center of the nearby giant elliptical galaxy m87 @xcite . in that galaxy , however , the plasma surrounding the bh could be nontransparent due to a high accretion rate onto the bh .",
    "the eht project includes an array of radio telescopes located on different continents , which will operate as a single vlbi radio interferometer at the frequency of 230  ghz ( wavelength 1.3  mm ) . by 2020 ,",
    "the construction of a vlbi array including more than 13 antennas is planned , which will be capable of resolving the bh shadow illuminated either by background sources @xcite or by the surrounding accretion disk @xcite .    in russia ,",
    "the space observatory millimetron ( the spectrum - m project ) is under development , which will include a radio telescope in the millimeter and submillimeter bands placed near the lagrangian point l2 of the earth - sun system , where a nanoarcsecond angular resolution may be achieved in the radio interferometer regime @xcite . with such a high angular resolution , the bh `` shadow '' could be resolved .",
    "the shape of the outer boundary of the shadow from the extreme kerr bh against a bright background is shown in fig .",
    "[ bhshadow ]",
    ".    the eht project will undoubtedly be an extremely important experiment of the 21st century , which will allow testing the existence of bhs and hence gr in the strong - field regime . in the future",

    "as noted in the introduction , direct ir observations of the so - called s0 stars moving near the galactic center in eccentric orbits provide the strongest evidence of the presence of an smbh at the galactic center . in @xcite ,",
    "the characteristic radial dependence of the stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath22 , was derived for the first time from spectroscopic observations and measurements of proper motions of the stars , which corresponds to a keplerian motion of the stars around a very massive object . by 1996 ,",
    "the mass of the object was estimated to be @xmath23 . according to modern measurements of these stars ,",
    "the mass @xmath24 is enclosed within a sphere with the radius @xmath25  pc .",
    "such a very compact massive object can be identified only with a black hole .",
    "recent vlbi data in the centimeter band suggest the presence of an emitting region around sgr  a * approximately @xmath26 in size , which is apparently related to an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "a joint analysis of vla ( very large array ) interferometry at centimeter wavelengths and alma ( atacama large millimeter array ) observations at 100  ghz points to the presence of collimated outflows from sgr  a * with moderate relativistic velocities @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the ir and x - ray activity of sgr  a * is very low ; it appears as a series of very rare and short - duration outbursts , which are interpreted in terms of accretion of gas clouds , planets @xcite , comets , or asteroids falling onto the bh .",
    "nevertheless , during these rare outbursts , quasiperiodic oscillations in the ir @xcite and x - ray @xcite bands were discovered .",
    "the physical origin of these oscillations is discussed in section  [ qpo ] .",
    "the smbh in the galactic center is ` dormant ' because of a low rate of tidal disruption of stars and a small accretion rate of the ambient gas .",
    "the rate of tidal disruption of stars by a @xmath28 , under the condition @xmath29 ( see formula ( [ cr ] ) in section 4 ) can be represented in the form @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the local relaxation time , @xmath32 . at the galactic center , the tidal disruption rate @xmath33",
    "yr@xmath9 coincides within an order of magnitude with the dark matter accretion rate from the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "with such an accretion rate , the sgr  a * bh could have grown to its present mass over the galaxy lifetime . the smbh evolution in galactic centers due to tidal disruption of stars and",
    "dark matter accretion has been studied for many years ( also see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although bhs in galactic centers are small in size , their powerful gravitational field can affect giant structures and processes on galactic scales and beyond .",
    "for example , the accretion luminosity of smbhs in quasars could reionize all the gas in the universe @xcite . in active galaxies ,",
    "central bhs are powerful emitters in various bands , and also produce relativistic jets starting near the bh gravitational radius and propagating far beyond the galaxies @xcite .    during each tidal disruption event , occurring once every @xmath34 years , a short - lived accretion disk is formed around the bh for about 5 - 10  years . during this time interval ,",
    "the `` dormant '' quasar at the galactic center `` wakes up '' , its eddington luminosity becomes comparable to that of all stars in the galaxy , and relativistic jets are generated perpendicular to the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the past activity of sgr  a * could be traced back by recent observations of the diffuse iron line in 6.4  kev emission @xcite and hydrogen ionization in the central 1  pc region @xcite .",
    "two giant diffuse gamma - ray `` bubbles '' discovered by the fermi satellite symmetrically on both sides of the galactic disk plane @xcite may be a long - term imprint of this activity .",
    "fermi bubbles might be formed due to matter outflow from tidally disrupted stars flying close to the central bh @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosity of the fermi bubbles is @xmath35  erg  s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the bubbles have a size of up to 10 kpc and have a structure similar to the nonthermal microwave haze discovered by the wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) satellite @xcite , as well as to the extended x - ray emission lobes discovered by the rosat ( from german rosat satellite ) telescope @xcite .",
    "the features of gamma bubbles are consistent with the model of multiple energy injections from the galactic center due to the central bh activity @xcite .",
    "however , there is an alternative model explaining the energy pumping into the gamma bubbles by the energetic winds of protons and heavy ions from star formation inside the inner region about 200  pc in size @xcite .",
    "the central star cluster @xcite comprises the mass @xmath36 within @xmath37  pc .",
    "the corresponding virial velocity of stars in this cluster is @xmath38  km  s@xmath9 , and their number density is very high , @xmath39  pc@xmath40 , which is eight orders of magnitude higher than in the solar vicinity , @xmath41  pc@xmath40 .",
    "the radial density distribution found in @xcite from adaptive optical observations in the near ir using the vlt ( very large telescope ) at eso ( european southern observatory ) has the form @xmath42",
    "pc@xmath40 , where @xmath43 for @xmath44  pc  @xmath45  pc and @xmath46 for @xmath47  pc .    in the central cluster , old stars with enhanced metal abundance",
    "compared to the halo stars dominate . however , among the brightest stars , there is a sizeable fraction of young stars with different metallicities .",
    "it is currently unclear whether the young stars were formed where they are currently observed , or they were formed away from the center but migrated to small radii , for example , due to gravitational scattering on other stars .",
    "possibly , the young hot stars are responsible for the practically full ionization of hydrogen in the circumnuclear disk inside the inner 150  pc , while at larger distances ( up to 1  kpc ) , molecular hydrogen , whose density is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of ionized hydrogen , accounts for only 4% of the stellar mass @xcite .",
    "some massive ob stars , apparently , were formed in collisions and coalescences of less massive stars .",
    "it is also interesting to note that in the distribution of stars around sgr  a * , thin disks tilted by large angles to each other can be discerned , which could be due to a complex star formation history of the central cluster .",
    "it is possible that the stellar density maximum does not coincide with sgr  a * and is located @xmath48 to the east @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the formation history of the central part of the galaxy is more complicated .",
    "the local relaxation time of the total orbital energy @xmath49 of a star due to binary collisions of stars in the central stellar cluster is @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath52 is the total number of stars in the system , @xmath53 is the mass of the star , and @xmath54 is the local number density of stars . due to the high number density of stars , relaxation time ( [ te ] ) in the central cluster is significantly smaller than the galactic age , @xmath55  years .",
    "this means that the dynamical evolution of the central stellar cluster caused by relaxation processes significantly affects its structure on a time scale exceeding the dynamical time @xmath56  years . in self - gravitating stellar systems consisting of a large number of stars ,",
    "the relaxation time is significantly larger than the dynamical time : @xmath57 for @xmath58 . on time",
    "scales much shorter than the relaxation time , i.e. , for @xmath59 , the motion of stars in such systems is collisionless , and the orbital energy of stars is conserved , @xmath60 .",
    "conversely , for @xmath61 , orbital energies of stars change in a diffuse way .",
    "the dynamical evolution also depends on the gravitational interaction of stars with the central smbh inside the radius of its gravitational influence , @xmath62 . as a result",
    ", a stellar density peak can be formed near the bh due to the accumulation of stars in finite orbits ( i.e. , gravitationally connected with the bh ) with energies @xmath63 .",
    "the finite star reservoir is replenished due to infinite stars ( those gravitationally disconnected from the bh ) that transit to finite orbits due to gravitational interactions . the number density of infinite stars inside the bh influence radius @xmath64 scales as @xmath65 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    a similar problem of the relaxation of a multi - charged ion in plasma with the identical interaction mechanism was first considered in 1964 by gurevich @xcite , who calculated the distribution function of finite electrons around an ion as @xmath66 .",
    "this distribution function , which is a nonlinear isotropic solution of the stationary kinetic equation in the fokker - planck approximation , describes the diffusion of electrons toward the multi - charged ion .",
    "this distribution function corresponds to the electron number density peak near the ion : @xmath67 . a similar problem for the number density of stars around an smbh",
    "was considered by bahcall and wolf @xcite .    at the galactic center ,",
    "the flux of solar - type stars onto a bh is determined by their entering the loss cone @xcite , in which a star with a mass @xmath68 and a radius @xmath69 is tidally disrupted by the bh @xcite by flying near it at a distance closer than the tidal radius @xmath70 . for solar - type stars , this radius exceeds the gravitational radius of sgr  a*. only white dwarfs and neutron stars are `` swallowed up '' by this bh as a whole without being tidally destroyed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the tidal disruption of stars falling into the loss cone due to diffusion of their orbital angular momentum @xmath71 leads to an anisotropy of the distribution function at the orbital energies of finite stars @xmath72 , where the critical radius @xmath73 under the condition @xmath29 is expressed as @xcite @xmath74 for @xmath75 , the distribution function of finite stars in the gravitational field of a bh can be approximated as @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the minimum angular momentum of stars at which they reach the tidal disruption radius @xmath78 .",
    "the number density of stars attains a maximum at @xmath79 and tends to zero when approaching the tidal disruption radius @xmath78 . at @xmath80 ,",
    "the density peak does not form because there is no accumulation of finite stars around the bh .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show the number density of stars around an smbh at @xmath81 .",
    "the above asymptotic formulas for stellar distribution around an smbh are obtained with account for binary interactions from the corresponding solution of the fokker - planck equations .",
    "the binary interaction approximation remains partially valid for studies of dark matter particles inside the bh influence radius rh ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . but",
    "determining the boundary conditions at the bh influence radius in order to normalize the dark matter particle density is complicated due to additional uncertainties related to the dark matter interaction with the galactic disk and the bulge @xcite .",

    "according to the hierarchical model of galaxy formation , which is currently commonly recognized , low - mass galaxies ( protogalaxies ) are first formed , which later merge to form large present - day galaxies . because stellar disks are present in spiral galaxies , which were not destroyed in mergers , spiral",
    "galaxies must have been formed from single large density perturbations , and the mergers played a less significant role there than in ellipticals , at least at the late stages .",
    "nevertheless , some protogalaxies could merge with our galaxy .",
    "for example , the properties and composition of the bulge ( central spherical component ) of our and other spiral galaxies are very similar to those of small elliptical galaxies @xcite , and could be a remnant of one or several elliptical protogalaxies .",
    "observations in the 21  cm and 2.6  mm lines suggest the presence at the galactic center of a gas disk 3  kpc in diameter and 200 pc thick , tilted to the galactic plane by @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "this tilt could arise from mergers of stellar systems of protogalaxies with different orientations of their angular momentum .",
    "many of the protogalaxies or satellite galaxies were tidally disrupted and mixed up with the galactic matter .",
    "several star streams are known that most likely are remnants of satellite galaxies that merged recently with our galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is also assumed that some of the galactic globular clusters can be remnants of dwarf galaxies , whose outer parts were stripped by tidal gravitational forces @xcite .    to learn how the central smbh was formed in the galaxy ,",
    "it is necessary to understand at which stage the central bhs started forming in protogalaxies and how they subsequently merged .",
    "there are many reviews devoted to the formation of smbhs in the galactic and pre - galactic epochs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and we do not discuss these models here .",
    "we just mention several possible variants : gravitational collapse of supermassive stars and compact stellar clusters ; multiple mergers of stellar - mass bhs ( including those formed in explosions of the pre - galactic population iii stars ) ; and the presence of primordial bhs with high masses that served as seeds for galactic smbhs @xcite .",
    "after protogalaxies merge , central bhs can approach and coalesce .",
    "the coalescence mechanism of sufficiently massive bhs is generally well understood .",
    "it includes the dynamical friction that tends to move the remnant of a merging protogalaxy and its central bh toward the center of the new galaxy , and the orbital shrinking of a binary bh at late stages occurs due to gravitational wave emission .",
    "low - mass bhs have no time to settle at the galactic center over the galactic life time , and therefore they are likely to reside in the halo . because there is evidence that even small galaxies contain central bhs , the galactic smbhs could form from the coalescence of several less massive bhs .",
    "possibly , these bhs originally resided in the protogalaxies that formed the galactic bulge .",
    "the central dark matter density peak depends on how long ago the bh mergers stopped , because the density peaks must be destroyed partially or completely in the mergers . however , it is currently impossible to restore the merger history of the central bh .",
    "conversely , the possible annihilation signal allows density peak reconstruction and can be used to gain insight into the evolution history of the central galactic supermassive bh .",
    "besides the visible stars , additional mass can exist inside the region between the bh event horizon and the influence radius in the form of both individual objects and diffuse matter . at first , this additional matter can include dim low - luminosity stars , which can not be directly observed by telescopes .",
    "because the stellar mass function increases toward low masses , these stars can significantly contribute to the total density . at the galactic center",
    ", there should be `` remnants '' of stellar evolution : stellar - mass bhs and neutron stars .",
    "stellar - mass bhs , with relatively large masses , settle down closer to the galactic center due to the mass segregation and form a compact central subsystem .",
    "consequently , their contribution to the central density peak can be substantial @xcite .",
    "the contribution from neutron stars is unknown , but their presence in the central density peak is very likely .",
    "an active pulsar was indeed discovered at a distance of 0.1  pc from the central bh @xcite ; however , most of the neutron stars could be unavailable for observations .",
    "constraints on the dark matter density at the galactic center due to neutron star collapses into bhs were discussed in @xcite .",
    "bounds on the number of stellar - mass bhs at the galactic center can be derived from x - ray luminosity due to gas accretion .",
    "the effect is strongest when a gas cloud falls onto the galactic center .",
    "when this cloud flies across the central region , accretion onto usually `` quiet '' bhs and neutron stars can occur , and they can temporarily become bright in x - rays .",
    "this effect was discussed in @xcite with regard to the fall of the g2 gas cloud onto the galactic center . since 2011 ,",
    "the g2 cloud has been observed approaching sgr  a * with a velocity of several thousand km  s  @xmath85 , stretched by tidal forces @xcite .",
    "however , no expected tidal disruption and subsequent accretion of gas happened at the g2 cloud periastron passage .",
    "nevertheless , this can occur in coming years during the next approaches of g2 to sgr  a*.    all invisible mass at the galactic center must distort the total newtonian potential @xmath86 of a point - like bh . as a result ,",
    "orbits of the s0 stars are not closed and precess ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in one to",
    "two years , the degree of nonclosedness , i.e. , the newtonian orbital precession , will be securely measured for the best studied s0 - 2 star .",
    "thus , the total mass of dark matter within this stellar orbit with the characteristic size of 0.005  pc will be estimated .",
    "the non - relativistic precession of orbits of the high - velocity s0 stars can significantly exceed the corresponding relativistic precession ( similar to the mercury perihelion shift and the lense - thirring effect ) even in the presence of a moderate amount of dark matter in the galactic center .",
    "the existence of high - velocity s0 stars offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct the gravitational potential and to measure the mass distribution in the galactic center by measuring their orbits . for a power - law dark matter density @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath64 , and @xmath89 are constant parameters ,",
    "the precession angle df of an elliptical orbit of an s0 star in one revolution around the central bh is expressed as @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the hypergeometric function , @xmath92 is the orbital eccentricity , @xmath93 is the orbital parameter , @xmath4 is the major semi - axis , and mbh is the bh mass .",
    "nonrelativistic precession angle ( [ itog ] ) is qualitatively consistent with numerical calculations of the precession @xcite .",
    "the precession angle ( [ itog ] ) for @xmath94 coincides with the corresponding expression obtained analytically by another method in @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that for large eccentricity @xmath95 , the precession direction calculated in @xcite changes sign ( becomes positive ) and diverges in the limit as @xmath96 .",
    "apparently , the method of calculations used in @xcite is applicable only for @xmath94 , because the newtonian precession angle @xmath97 is always negative for other eccentricities and @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "a multi - parameter fitting of orbits of s0 stars , as well as the estimate of possible additional diffuse mass @xcite , showed that the diffuse mass inside the s0 - 2 star orbit does not exceed 3 - 4% of the bh mass .",
    "the expected measurement of the nonrelativistic orbital precession of the s0 - 2 star will improve this limit by two to three orders of magnitude or will allow determining the dark matter mass inside this orbit .",

    "due to the presence of numerous objects and the complex distribution of gas clouds , it is difficult to theoretically predict this gamma - ray background and to take it into account in data analysis .    by assuming the entire observed gamma - ray emission to be due to dark matter annihilation and the thermal mechanism of dark matter particle creation in the early universe , it is possible to conclude that the upper bound of gamma - ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies already excludes dark matter particles with masses @xmath107  gev @xcite",
    "however , attempts are being made to improve the background subtraction to find possible gamma - ray excess .",
    "for this , complex numerical models of the secondary generation of gamma - ray emission by cosmic rays are being constructed and careful data analyses of gamma - ray observations are being made .",
    "it is claimed in @xcite that dark matter particles masses @xmath108  gev are already excluded at the 68% c.l .",
    "this result , of course , needs independent confirmation .",
    "the analysis of data obtained by the first - generation gamma - ray telescope compton - egret ( compton gamma - ray observatory - energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ) revealed the presence of a gamma - ray excess at energies @xmath109  gev @xcite .",

    "the excess is well described by neutralino annihilation with the mass @xmath112  gev and the thermal cross section @xmath113  @xmath114  s@xmath9 under the assumption that the dark matter density profile is described by the modified navarro - frenk - white law @xmath115 where @xmath116  gev  cm@xmath40 and @xmath118  kpc .",
    "the observed gamma - ray excess is best fit by @xmath119 , while @xmath120 in the standard profile .",
    "the region@xmath121 is called the cusp @xcite .",

    "the bh gravitational field can redistribute the dark matter density profile to produce a spike .",
    "the central density spike is mostly formed due to the central bh .",
    "the presence of a bh at the center of a dark matter halo increases the central dark matter density inside the bh influence radius @xmath122  pc , where @xmath123  km  s@xmath9 is the velocity dispersion inside the inner cusp .",
    "the density spike formed evolutionarily together with the bh and its properties are fundamentally dependent on the bh formation history .",
    "if the bh was merging with other bhs , the dark matter density spike could be formed and destroyed several times .",
    "these perturbations decrease its density .",
    "conversely , if the bh evolution was relatively quiet , i.e. , if the bh was formed early and gradually increased due to slow accretion , then the dark matter density spike around the bh would also gradually increase to a high value @xcite .",
    "such a gradually formed density peak is called the `` adiabatic peak '' .",
    "the results of calculations in @xcite suggest that the density distribution in the adiabatic peak is approximately power - law with the exponent @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the power - law exponent in ( [ ghalonfw ] ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath126 , we find @xmath127 .",
    "the maximum density @xmath128 of dark matter in the spike is limited by the annihilation effect @xcite .",
    "the density increase stops at the inner radius where dark matter has time to annihilate during the characteristic bh lifetime @xmath129  yrs .",
    "if annihilation is insignificant , the density growth continues to a few gravitational radii of the bh , where the capture of particles by the bh becomes important .",
    "scattering of dark matter particles by stars @xcite can also affect the dark matter density distribution in the spike to produce a universal dark matter density profile @xmath130 .",
    "such a scattering also helps to fill the loss cone and increases the flux of particles onto the bh , leading to a gradual evolutionary increase in the bh mass @xcite .",
    "the angular size of the density peak is smaller than the angular resolution of the fermi - lat telescope .",
    "therefore , the spike in gamma rays should be seen as a point - like source .",
    "calculations of the annihilation signal from an adiabatic density spike @xcite show that in the case @xmath131 , even a fairly small fraction of dark matter @xmath132 within the s0 - 2 star orbit would produce the annihilation gamma - ray signal that could already be detected by fermi - lat .",
    "the absence of an annihilation signal ( more precisely , the low upper bound on the possible signal ) suggests a very small amount of neutralino dark matter , with @xmath131 at the galactic center .",
    "but then this dark matter could not affect the orbits of stars at the level available for current observations .",
    "according to @xcite , the adiabatic spike could exist for particle with masses @xmath133  gev only for a nonstandard annihilation cross section @xmath134 , where @xmath135 .",
    "due to a high velocity dispersion near the bh , the annihilation cross section must decrease in this case .",
    "then , in spite of the presence of a significant amount of dark matter in the density spike region , the annihilation signal would be weak due to the small annihilation cross section . in this case , however , the large mass of dark matter can already provide detectable newtonian precession of the s0-star orbits .",
    "thus , the search for a possible annihilation signal from the galactic center is an independent additional method to determine the dark matter distribution .",
    "the gamma - ray excess from the galactic center at @xmath136  1 tev observed by the hess ( high energy stereoscopic system ) telescope could be explained by dark matter particle annihilation with the constraints from the stellar dynamics for a power - law dark matter density profile with a free power - law exponent @xcite .",

    "the absence of the adiabatic spike could be due to previous mergers of the central bh @xcite or tidal effects from the surrounding stars .",
    "namely , stellar fly - by perturbs dark matter in the spike , such that the spike `` heats up '' and becomes less dense @xcite .",
    "binary scatterings ( due to self - interaction ) of dark matter particles @xcite or a mismatch of the dark matter profile with the bh @xcite could be other reasons .",

    "we note that additional boosting of the annihilation signal is possible due to the dark matter clustering into low - scale self - gravitating clumps @xcite .",
    "apart from detection of gamma - ray emission , searching with giant neutrino telescopes ( icecube , antares ( astronomy with a neutrino telescope and abyss environmental research ) , baikal - gcd ( baikal gigaton volume detector ) , etc . ) for neutrino signals from the galactic center , which can be generated in dark matter particle annihilation , is important @xcite .",

    "<S> we review the physical processes that occur at the center of the galaxy and that are related to the supermassive black hole sgr a * residing there . the discovery of high - velocity s0 stars orbiting sgr a * for the first time allowed measuring the mass of this supermassive black hole , the closest one to us , with a 10% accuracy , with the result @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> further monitoring can potentially discover the newtonian precession of the s0 star orbits in the gravitational field of the black hole due to invisible distributed matter . </S>",
    "<S> this will yield the `` weight '' of the elusive dark matter concentrated there and provide new information for the identification of dark matter particles . </S>",
    "<S> the weak accretion activity of the `` dormant quasar '' at the galactic center occasionally shows up as quasiperiodic x - ray and near - ir oscillations with mean periods of @xmath1 and @xmath2 min . </S>",
    "<S> these oscillations can possibly be interpreted as related to the rotation frequency of the sgr a * event horizon and to the latitude oscillations of hot plasma spots in the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> both these frequencies depend only on the black hole gravitational field and not on the accretion model . using this interpretation yields quite the accurate values for both the mass @xmath3 and the spin @xmath4 ( kerr rotation parameter ) of sgr a * : @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>"
