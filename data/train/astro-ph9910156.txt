    "two regions contain high - velocity ( hv hereafter ) molecular outflows , the irc2/i outflow in the bn / kl nebula and the orion  s region .    the first evidence of massive star formation in the orion  s region , located @xmath13 south of irc2 came from the presence of warm gas ( ziurys et al . , 1981 ) and large dust column densities ( keene , hildebrand & whitcomb , 1982 ) .",
    "subsequent observations of co with higher angular resolution showed the presence of a long filament at moderate velocities ( @xmath14km@xmath1s@xmath2 ) which has been interpreted as a redshifted monopolar jet powered by fir@xmath14 ( schmid@xmath12burgk et al . , 1990 ) .",
    "masers have been detected in the vicinity of fir@xmath14 but they are not related with the monopolar jet ( gaume et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , the h@xmath15o masers seem to be associated with the very fast bullets ( @xmath16km@xmath1s@xmath2 ) found in the compact bipolar outflow recently detected by rodrguez  franco et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which is perpendicular to the low velocity jet .",
    "due to its nearness and intense co emission , the prominent high - velocity co outflow in the kl nebula has been the subject of intense study in several rotational transitions of this molecule ( kwan & scoville , 1976 ; zuckerman , kuiper & rodrguez@xmath12kuiper , 1976 ; wannier & phillips , 1977 ; phillips et al . , 1977 ;",

    "the first observations showed the presence of outflowing gas at velocities up to @xmath17km@xmath1s@xmath2 from the cloud velocity .",
    "strong shocks produced by the interaction of the outflow from the powering source with the ambient material gives rise to strong emission of vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen h@xmath18 ( see e.g. nadeau & geballe , 1979 ) , h@xmath15o masers around the source irc2/i ( gaume et al , 1998 ) and molecules like sio , so , so@xmath15 ( wright et al . , 1996 ) produced by shock chemistry .    in spite of the large numbers of observations of this molecular outflow , its nature is so far unclear .",

    "this is powered by source i ( chernin & wright , 1996 ) .",
    "however the wide opening angle model can not account for a number of observational facts such as the spatial distribution and kinematics of the high and low velocity h@xmath15o and the sio masers ( greenhill et al .",
    ", 1998 ; doeleman et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , the morphology of the hv co emission at intermediate velocities shows that the outflow is offset from irc2/i by @xmath21 indicating that a complex channeling of the hv gas is needed if irc2/i is the powering source ( wilson et al . , 1986 ) .",

    "franco et al . ( 1999 ) has mapped the irc2/i molecular outflow with high sensitivity .",
    "the spatial distribution of the most extreme velocity shows the lack of bipolarity around irc2/i as expected from the wide opening angle model .",
    "these maps also reveal a ring - like structure of high - velocity bullets which also are difficult to account for if the outflow has a wide opening angle .",
    "franco et al . ( 1999 ) have proposed that the ring of the hv co bullets and the distribution and kinematics of the h@xmath15o masers could be explained if the outflow is driven by a precessing jet oriented along the line of sight .",
    "if this is the explanation , this will allow us to specify the main entrainment mechanism in molecular outflows ( see e.g. raga & biro , 1993 ; cabrit , 1995 ) .",
    "in this paper we present new maps of the co emission and analyze in detail the morphology of the co emission at moderate and extreme velocities in the irc2/i and orion  s molecular outflows , and present new arguments supporting the idea that the orion outflows are young and driven by high velocity jets .",

    "the jet is aligned along the line of sight , we have to rotate the outflow axis to point towards the observer . to do this",
    ", we have assumed that the outflows have a cylindrical geometry .",
    "the radial velocities have not been corrected for projection effects since this is a constant factor for all velocities .",

    "[ fig : modeloa]b and c respectively . remarkably , the area@xmath12velocity dependence derived for both jet driven molecular outflows are very similar to that found for the irc2/i outflow .",
    "these results strongly support the idea that the irc2/i outflow is also driven by a jet oriented along the line of sight .",
    "to explain the area@xmath12velocity dependence found for these outflows , we have considered a very simple model which mimics the kinematics of a bipolar jet . in this simple model ,",
    "the ejected material is very fast and well collimated around the symmetry axis .",
    "away from the jet axis , the material surrounding the jet is entrained generating the more extended low velocity outflow with lower terminal velocities .",
    "we have modeled this kinematics by using a simple velocity law given by    @xmath75    where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the spatial coordinates , @xmath79 is the collimation parameter of the outflow ( i.e. the radius of the jet ) , @xmath80 is the velocity of the molecular jet and @xmath81 is the direction in which the material is moving .",
    "when the material is within the jet ( @xmath82 ) @xmath81 is along the jet direction , while it is in the radial direction outside the jet .",
    "the bipolar morphology is taken into account by supposing that the hv gas is restricted to a biconical geometry .",
    "the model combines two kind of parameters : the intrinsic outflow parameters such as @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and the geometry ( i.e. the cone parameters ) .",
    "the collimation parameter is derived by fitting the observations , and @xmath80 , which can not be determined since the orientation of the jet along the line of sight is unknown , has been considered the terminal velocity measured for the data . if the symmetry axis of the cone is along the line of sight , the semi - axis of the ellipses on the plane of the sky ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) are directly measured from the size corresponding to the minimum terminal velocity contour ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bipolar]c and d ) .",
    "the length of the cone along the line of sight , @xmath85 , is a free parameter , determined from the model . under the assumptions discussed above",
    ", the model contains only two free parameters : the collimation parameter , and the size of the molecular outflow along the line of sight .",
    "the results of this simple model for the best fit to the data for the three outflows are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : modeloa]a , b , and c as solid lines , and the derived parameters are given in table [ tab : parametros ] .",
    "the results are very sensitive to small changes of the collimation parameter , but very insensitive to the size of the outflow along the line of sight .",
    "changes by @xmath86 in the collimation parameter greatly worsen the fit to the data . the data , however , can be fit with any length of an outflow larger than the value of the minor semiaxis of the ellipsoid .",
    "our results indicate a similar collimation parameter for the two outflows driven by low mass stars , but it is a factor of 2 larger for the irc2/i outflow .",
    "this difference can be related either to the fact that the low mass star outflows are much younger than that of the irc2/i outflow , or to different types of stars driving the outflows .",
    "we conclude that the overall kinematics and the morphology of the ehv gas observed in the irc2/i outflow is consistent with a jet driven molecular outflow oriented along the line of sight with a jet radius of 0.06@xmath1pc .",

    "the next question is , how does this model explain the mass distribution of the hv gas in the outflow ? .    in figure",
    "[ fig : masa - flujos]a and b we show masses derived from the co line intensities integrated in 5@xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2 intervals as a function of velocity .",
    "this figure shows that the bulk of the mass at moderate radial velocities is also found at the locations where the gas shows the largest terminal velocity . in the proposed jet",
    "driven model , this would correspond to the material located at small projected distance from the outflow axis ( i.e. in the jet direction ) .    at first glance , these results are surprising since one expects to find only the highest velocity gas in the jet direction .",
    "however , there are two possibilities which could explain the derived mass distribution in the irc2/i outflow . in the first",
    ", one assumes that the vicinity of the exciting source large quantities of gas moves with all velocities as a result of the dragging of the ambient material by the action of the jet . in the second",
    ", one assumes that just the opposite is true , i.e. the masses at moderate velocities are located far from the exciting source , only in the jet heads , where jet impacts on the ambient medium . in this case , the hv gas will appear with all velocities only in the direction of the jet .",
    "unfortunately , the orientation of the irc2/i outflow , along the line of sight , prevent us from determining which of the two proposed scenarios account for the data .",
    "again , we will compare the results for the irc2/i outflow with those obtained from the jet driven outflows l@xmath11448 and i@xmath13282 as described in section 6.3.1 .",
    "we have estimated the expected mass distribution of the l@xmath74 and i@xmath90 outflows if the jets were oriented along the line of sight .",
    "for these two outflows it is possible to separate the contribution to the total mass of the outflow for two different regions in the outflow . the head lobes , and the exciting source . figs .",
    "[ fig : masa - flujos]c to e show the mass distribution as a function of the radial velocity in these two regions for the l@xmath74 and the i@xmath90 outflows in velocity intervals of 10@xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "using the results of l@xmath11448 and i@xmath13282 , the bulk of the mass for all terminal velocities would arise from the head lobes close to the jet axis where one also observes the largest terminal velocities .",
    "only a small fraction of the mass is found close to the exciting source .",
    "these findings are consistent with the observations of the irc2/i outflow and implies that the largest fraction of the mass of the outflowing gas at low velocities is preferentially concentrated in the regions at the head lobes , and close to the jet axis .",
    "the similarity between the results obtained for the bipolar outflows l@xmath74 and i@xmath90 and those found in the irc2/i outflow suggest that the three outflows have a very similar mass distribution .",
    "this would indicate that the massive outflow driven by source i is produced by a jet and that a large fraction of the outflowing gas at low or moderate velocities is located at the end of jets in the head lobes , just in front and behind of the exciting source .",
    "the precessing jet scenario proposed for the molecular outflow in orion has important consequences in order to explain the different phenomena produced by the interaction of the outflow and the ambient gas like the h@xmath15 vibrationally excited emission ( h@xmath18 ) , the shock - chemistry found in this region , and the location and the origin of the low velocity and high velocity h@xmath15o masers .",
    "figure [ fig : modelo ] shows a sketch of the proposed model showing the regions where the different emissions could arise .",
    "according to this model ( rodrguez  franco et al . , 1999 ) , a precessing jet with very high velocities ( larger than 100@xmath1km@xmath1s@xmath2 ) is aligned close to the line of sight .",
    "the hv jet interacts with the surrounding material sweeping a considerable amount of gas and dust .",
    "the impact of the precessing jet on the ambient molecular gas produces a number of bow shocks in the head of the two lobes . within the most recent bow shocks",
    "one expects to observe h@xmath18 emission and bullets and the low and high velocity h@xmath15o masers as discussed in detailed by rodrguez ",
    "franco et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "a precessing jet would explain the distribution of the hv bullets and the large number of h@xmath15o masers at low radial velocities .",
    "we now will discuss how the proposed model can also explains the overall properties of the h@xmath18 emission and the `` plateau '' emission .",
    "the most straightforward evidence of the interaction between the high velocity jets and the ambient medium comes from h@xmath18 ( see e.g. , garden et al . , 1986 ; doyon & nadeau , 1988 ) . in our model",
    ", the h@xmath18 emission should mostly appear at the head lobes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : modelo ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath18 emission is expected to be located just in the intermediate layer between the jet and the hv co emission ( see rodrguez  franco et al . , 1999 ) , and one would , therefore , expect similar extent for both emissions .",
    "this is illustrated in the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : co - h2 ] where we present the comparison between the spatial distribution of the co emission in the bow shock and that of the h@xmath18 . in the proposed geometry",
    ", the h@xmath18 emission should be affected by the extinction produced by the hv blueshifted gas and dust located between the observer and the redshifted h@xmath18 layer . indeed , though the overall h@xmath18 and co bow shock emissions are very similar , there are also important differences . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : co - h2 ] , the most intense co bow shock emission is located between irc2 and the h@xmath18 peak 1 ( beckwith et al . , 1978 ) , just in the region where the h@xmath18 emission shows a minimum .",
    "this difference agrees with the idea of a large accumulation of material near the jet heads , close to the direction where the jet impinges .    from our co data , the largest column of density in the blueshifted bow shock",
    "is found @xmath23 north of irc2/i . at this position",
    "we derive , from the hv co data , an h@xmath15 column of density of @xmath91@xmath92 which corresponds to an extinction at 2.1@xmath93 m of @xmath94mag , in good agreement with the extinction of 0.6@xmath1mag derived by geballe et al .",
    "additional evidence in favor of the proposed geometry comes from the variation of the extinction as a function of the velocity derived from the h@xmath18 emission .",
    "scoville et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , and geballe et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , have found that the extinction in the h@xmath18 line wings is larger than at the line center by @xmath95mag .",
    "if the ejection is jet - driven , a large quantity of ambient material is accumulated in the head of the lobes near the outflow axis where one observes the largest radial velocities . therefore ,",
    "if the jet axis is oriented along the line of sight , the highest velocities should be the most affected by the extinction produced by the gas and dust pushed by the outflow . in a similar way , the proposed geometry can naturally explain the asymmetry observed in the h@xmath18 line emission in which the blueshifted emission is less extincted ( between 0.1 and @xmath96mag ) than the redshifted emission .    with the proposed scenario , one can estimate the ratio between the h@xmath18 and the co hv material in the bow shock . for the position of pk1 ,",
    "the vibrationally excited hydrogen column density is @xmath97@xmath92 ( brand et al . , 1988 ) , and the co column density obtained for both outflow wings is @xmath98@xmath92 .",
    "then , the co / h@xmath18 ratio would be @xmath99 .",
    "this indicates that , as expected , only a very small fraction of the shocked gas is hot enough to be detected in the h@xmath18 lines .",
    "even , after the correction for extinction , the thickness of the h@xmath18 layer must be at least two orders of magnitude thinner than the colder shocked co layer .",
    "the `` plateau '' component is the source of broad line wings in a number of molecules which are believed to be produced by shock chemistry .",
    "based in observations of molecules like so , so@xmath15 , sio and hco@xmath100 , which are good tracers of the low - velocity outflow , plambeck et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and wright et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have suggested that this low velocity emission arise from a ring or `` doughnut '' of gas expanding outward from irc2/i .",
    "the origin of these molecules is closely relate with shocks ( see martn ",
    "pintado et al . , 1992 ) , and they are produced by the interaction of the outflowing gas with the dense ambient clouds ( bachiller & prez  gutirrez , 1997 ) .    in the proposed model , the bulk of shocked gas occurs in the bow shocks produced in the heads of the two lobes , in the direction of the line of sight . as in the low mass outflows ( bachiller & prez  gutirrez , 1997 )",
    ", the bow shocks will favor the observation of molecules characteristics of a shock chemistry like hco@xmath100 , so , so@xmath15 or sio in the region of high density .",
    "this might explain why this emission has low velocity and is observed just around the outflow axis .",
    "a similar situation have been observed in l@xmath11157 , a low mass star driven outflow , whose axis is almost in the plane of the sky ( bachiller & prez  gutirrez , 1997 ) . in this outflow",
    "one can observe that the abundance of molecules like sio , ch@xmath101oh , h@xmath15co , hcn , cn , so and so@xmath15 is enhanced by at least an order of magnitude in the shocked region at the head of both lobes , with low abundance in the vicinity of the exciting source .",
    "most of the mass observed in molecular outflows is made by ambient material entrained by a `` primary wind '' from the central source .",
    "two basic processes of entrainment has been considered to explain the bulk of the mass in the bipolar outflows ( see e.g. cabrit , 1995 ) .    * viscous mixing layers at the steady - state , produced via kelvin ",
    "helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities at the interface between the outflow and the ambient cloud ( stahler , 1994 ) .",
    "* prompt entrainment , produced at the end of the jet head in a curved bow shock that accelerates and sweeps the ambient gas creating a dense cover with a low density cocoon surrounding the jet ( raga & cabrit , 1993 ) .",
    "studies of the co line profiles in several molecular outflows indicates that prompt entrainment at the jet head is the main mechanism for molecular entrainment ( see e.g. chernin et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , precessing jets have been also invoked to explain the large opening angles of bipolar outflows ( chernin & masson , 1995 ) .",
    "however , it has been argued that the precessing angles are small and the propagation of large bowshock seems to be the dominant mechanism in the formation of bipolar outflows for low mass stars ( gueth et al . , 1996 ) .    the proposed scenario ( a jet driven molecular outflow ) for the irc2/i outflow confirms that the main mechanism for entrainment in this outflow is also prompt entrainment at the jet heads , in agreement with the raga & cabrit ( 1993 ) model .",
    "however , the presence of hv bullets ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : bipolar]e and f ) are best explained ( see rodrguez  franco et al . , 1999 ) by the model of a precessing jet ( raga & biro , 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , the area - velocity relation is well explained in both , low mass star molecular outflows ( l@xmath11448 , i@xmath13282 ) , and in the massive star irc2/i outflow by a radial expansion from the exciting source similar to that found in the l@xmath11157 outflow ( gueth et al . , 1996 ) . as illustrated in the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelo ] this would be easily explained in the framework of the precessing jet with prompt entrainment since the shocked material will be always moving in the direction of the jet , i.e. , just in the radial direction from the exciting source .",
    "another important result from our data is the large transverse velocities measured from the co data which can be up to @xmath102% of the jet velocity .",
    "the large transverse velocities in jet driven molecular outflows will also explain the shell - like outflows as more evolved objects .",
    "the typical time scale for a young jet - like molecular outflow to evolve to a shell - like molecular outflow with a cavity of @xmath103pc will be of @xmath57years for the typical transverse velocity measured in the irc2/i outflow .",
    "this is in agreement with the ages found in shell like outflows powered by intermediate mass stars ( ngc@xmath17023 , fuente et al . , 1998 ) and low mass stars ( l@xmath11551-irs@xmath15 , plambeck & snell , 1995 ) .",
