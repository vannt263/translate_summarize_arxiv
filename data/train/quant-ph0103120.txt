    "first , we discuss the choice of cut - off radius @xmath96 and the asymptotic radius @xmath102 for our numerical calculations .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig3 ] illustrate effects of different values for electric dipole cut off radius @xmath96 . in general , we find that resonance peak shifts towards higher @xmath114 values as @xmath115 increases .",
    "because of the perturbative nature for the effective long range dipole interaction , @xmath115 is always taken to be much larger than @xmath116 . unless otherwise stated , we will use @xmath117 to present our results .",
    "the small @xmath115 dependence can be operationally fixed by a normalization against any dc - e field dependent experimental data .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows that , among all partial wave channels , scattering in the s - wave ( @xmath1 ) channel is the most sensitive with the choice of cut - off radius , while higher @xmath0 channel results remain almost unaffected .",
    "physically this @xmath115 dependence can be explained in terms of the centrifugal potential term @xmath118 which is absent for the s - wave channel . comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we see that the resonance at @xmath119 ( kv / cm ) is mostly due to the contribution from @xmath120 ( s - wave ) despite the anisotropic nature of dc - e induced dipole interaction . the coupling of s- to d - wave is the main reason for such a resonance as otherwise there seems no direct dipole interaction contributions to the s - wave channel .",
    "our extensive calculations show that typical values of @xmath121 are many orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath120 [ for @xmath122 ( mv / cm ) ] .",
    "this is explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the ratio for different partial wave cross sections are compared with the s - wave one .",
    "we see that at low energies , scattering cross section for @xmath123 channels are smaller than that for the s - wave ( @xmath1 ) by at least two orders of magnitude for @xmath122 ( mv / cm ) . at and near the resonance ,",
    "scattering for @xmath44 are absolutely negligible ( @xmath124 of @xmath125 ) in this case .    for @xmath126 ( kv / cm )",
    ", we find the @xmath115-dependence to be marginal as shown in fig .",
    "but at increased field strength the overall effect is not always negligible ( @xmath127% ) .",
    "next , we consider the low energy threshold dependence of the scattering cross section . as discussed earlier , we expect the asymptotic behaviour @xmath128 at sufficiently low energies .",
    "we have performed extensive calculations to assure that all reported results are asymptotically converging such that we indeed have reached this limit . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we display the variation of total scattering cross section @xmath129 as a function of energy ranging from nk to mk regime .",
    "we see that for @xmath130 ( kv / cm ) , @xmath129 becomes almost independent of energy below 1 ( @xmath131k ) , while at @xmath119 ( kv / cm ) @xmath129 varies almost linearly with inverse of energy in the range of @xmath132 ( nk ) to @xmath133 ( @xmath131k ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that at @xmath119 ( kv / cm ) , a resonance occurs at low energy as discussed later resulting in a divergent low energy cross section @xmath134 .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] is a selected result from odd ( @xmath0 ) partial wave channels for @xmath135rb ( fermion ) .",
    "no resonance structure was ever detected in such cases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we plot the scattering cross section of @xmath3rb for large fields @xmath136 ( mv / cm ) .",
    "as the field strength increases the resonance become more closely spaced .",
    "again , the major contribution to the scattering comes from s - wave channel , although increased coupling between s- and higher @xmath0- partial waves with field strength is responsible for the multiple peak resonance structure .",
    "the results presented so far are obtained by radial integrations of coupled schredinger equations .",
    "there are certain practical disadvantages of using such a exclusively numerical method .",
    "first , it takes considerable amount of time to obtain the results , since the propagation of solutions continue until the asymptotic radius , which can be of the order of @xmath137 or higher , is reached .",
    "the lower the energy , the longer the cpu time is needed because of increased @xmath138 ; second , the increase of either collision energy or dc - e field strength or both calls for reduced propagation step size which again prolongs numerical computations ; third , as discussed earlier , the asymptotic boundary is not well defined .",
    "therefore , no direct physical insight is gained about the resonance . in order to overcome these shortcomings of the numerical method",
    ", we have developed a mqdt for scattering with anisotropic dipole interactions .",
    "quantum defect theory ( qdt ) relies on matching numerically integrated scattering solutions to analytic solutions ( not asymptotic plane waves ) .",
    "the integration can be restricted to much shorter radius @xmath8 if appropriate analytical solutions are known .",
    "this not only makes the computation faster , the use of analytical solutions to the long range potential also helps to gain deep insight into resonance phenomena and low energy threshold behaviour .",

    "; the quantum defect @xmath131 accounts for effects of the ionic core on a highly excited electron .",
    "the idea of qdt has been successfully applied in atomic collisions and spectroscopy over the years @xcite .",
    "the multichannel version of qdt , known as mqdt provides a good theoretical framework for analysis of diverse phenomena in atomic and molecular physics . in collision theory , mqdt requires analytical solutions in all asymptotic channel potentials . in the present problem including anisotropic dipole interaction , the diagonal elements of potential matrix goes asymptotically as @xmath140 with @xmath141 for @xmath1 and @xmath142 for all other channels ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the exact solutions of these power law potentials have only recently become available through application of secular perturbation method @xcite .",

    "it becomes a slowly varying function of @xmath8 and approaches a constant at @xmath185 where the potential attains its power law asymptotic form ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "the matching point @xmath149 is therefore appropriately chosen such that @xmath184 becomes independent of @xmath8 .",
    "this is always possible as all analytic dependence on potential and collision energy is taken care of by the various @xmath186 functions .",

    "the effective potential @xmath229 ( diagonal term plus centrifugal barrier ) has a maximum ( barrier ) at @xmath230 given by the condition @xmath231 , i.e. @xmath232 and the barrier height is given by @xmath233 . since coefficient @xmath234 is proportional to field intensity @xmath235",
    ", @xmath236 is linearly proportional to @xmath235 .",
    "consequently , the barrier height becomes inversely proportional to @xmath237 .",
    "the coupling between s- and d - wave channels may lead to combined new bound or quasi - bound states or both at near - zero energies .",
    "the existence of these states is manifested in the form of scattering resonance .",
    "for instance when an incident low energy atom from s - wave channel hits a quasi - bound states supported by the d - wave centrifugal barrier , we may have a situation resemble what is commonly known as a feshach resonance @xcite .",
    "if there exists a bound state at or near zero energy , scattering cross sections will consequently be enhanced many - fold .",
    "this is indeed the case found in our earlier extensive numerical calculations . as will be proven in the next section on bound states , such resonance structures",
    "can be fully explained based on zero energy bound states using the mqdt .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , low energy scattering resonance is a signature of a bound or quasibound state near zero energy . at some critical dc - e field strength",
    ", a new bound state is formed at micro- or submicro - kelvin energy leading to the observed zero - energy shape resonance . in order to elucidate this point explicitly",
    ", we again rely on the two - channel model and find its last bound or quasibound state just below zero energy by the mqdt formulation .",
    "the asymptotic form of linearly independent base pairs @xmath238 and @xmath239 satisfying the schroedinger equation with a potential @xmath140 for @xmath240 can be expressed as @xmath241 where @xmath242 s are chosen to be real functions .",
    "for the two coupled channels discussed in the previous section , we have @xmath243^{-1},\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\left[\\{\\beta\\sin(\\pi\\nu)+\\alpha\\cos(\\pi\\nu)\\}g(-\\nu)-\\alpha g(\\nu)\\right],\\nonumber\\\\ w_{g-}^{(60)}&=&(4\\pi\\kappa)^{-1/2}[(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^2)\\sin(\\pi\\nu)]^{-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\left[\\{\\alpha\\sin(\\pi\\nu)-\\beta\\cos(\\pi\\nu)\\}g(-\\nu)+\\beta g(\\nu)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath244,\\nonumber\\\\ w_{g-}^{(32)}&=&2(2\\pi\\kappa)^{-1/2 } \\left[-\\frac{c_{-}(-\\nu)}{g(-\\nu)}\\delta^{\\nu}+ \\frac{c_{-}(\\nu)}{g(\\nu)}\\delta^{-\\nu}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] except for @xmath245 , all notations used here follow from earlier definitions as in appendix - a .",

    "the condition for the existence of a new bound state , i.e. eq .

    "since the value of @xmath262 is typically much smaller than @xmath263 near resonance , as an approximation , we can drop the two off - diagonal elements from @xmath184 .",
    "we then obtain two uncoupled bound spectrum series , given respectively by @xmath264 and @xmath265 the first condition eq .",
    "( [ cbeq2 ] ) gives bound states predominantly supported by s - wave channel .",
