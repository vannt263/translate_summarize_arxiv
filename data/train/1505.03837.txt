    "the aim of this appendix is to prove a tight upper bound on the quantum violation of the elegant bell inequality @xmath136 defined by ( [ elineq ] ) in the main text .    using the maximally entangled two - qubit state @xmath53 and projective measurements @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 on alice s side , while the following four projective measurements on bob s side @xmath148 we obtain the bell violation @xmath130 .",
    "we now show that this amount of bell violation for inequality @xmath136 is optimal . to this end , let us redefine the bell operator , @xmath149 , were @xmath150 is the standard bell operator defined by the inequality ( [ elineq ] ) and the measurement operators by alice and bob : @xmath151 finding the largest quantum violation of the elegant bell inequality   corresponds to maximising ( minimising ) the largest ( smallest ) eigenvalue of @xmath150 ( @xmath152 ) over all quantum observables @xmath153 and @xmath154 by alice and bob .    using the fact that @xmath155 , it is easy to see that @xmath152 admits a sum of squares ( sos ) decomposition in the form @xmath156 , where @xmath157 are linear combinations of the operators @xmath153 and @xmath154 as follows @xmath158    this implies that @xmath152 is positive semidefinite , hence @xmath159",
    ". therefore , the maximum quantum value of @xmath136 is upper bounded by @xmath130 .",
    "since this value is attained with a quantum realization presented above , we have a new tsirelson - type bound for quantum correlations .",
    "note that by applying the methods of refs .",
    "@xcite one gets the same upper bound of @xmath130 on the maximum quantum value of the bell inequality @xmath136 .",
    "here we give a detailed description of the bell setup used to generate global randomness exceeding 2 bits from two - qubit entangled states .",
    "note that according to the main text it is not possible to certify more than 4 bits of global randomness from any two - qubit state .",
    "since the observed statistics provide an upper bound to the intrinsic randomness of the setup , in order to obtain 4 bits , we have to find a pair of 4-outcome extremal measurements on a two - qubit state which yield @xmath160 for all results . to this end ,",
    "let us pick the maximally entangled state @xmath53 and alice s and bob s rank-1 extremal povm s as follows : @xmath161 where the four outputs are @xmath162 , and @xmath163 denotes the vector of three pauli matrices @xmath164 .",
    "alice s bloch vectors @xmath165 are distributed as @xmath166 while bob s bloch vectors @xmath167 look as follows @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a normalization factor and @xmath170 is a small positive constant .",
    "note that the measurements defined above fulfill two necessary conditions to approximate the value of @xmath160 for all results .",
    "( i ) vectors @xmath165 and @xmath167 become orthogonal when @xmath170 tends to zero .",
    "( ii ) both sets of vectors @xmath165 and @xmath167 span the three - dimensional space ( i.e. the povm elements are complex valued ) .",
    "let us now construct a 7-setting 2-outcome bell inequality which reads @xmath171 where @xmath172 .",
    "it is known that for a two - setting bell inequality @xmath173 the quantum maximum is @xmath174 . using this result",
    ", it is straightforward to establish the upper bound of @xmath175 on the maximum quantum value of the above inequality @xmath176 .",
    "this value can in fact be attained by using the state @xmath59 and observables @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 for @xmath181 and @xmath182 for @xmath183 , where the bloch vectors above are defined according to equations  ( [ ua],[vb ] ) . in this construction , the diagonal term @xmath184 forces alice and bob to choose correlated measurements , whereas the other parts of the inequality are used to steer alice and bob s measurements to the ones defined by the bloch vectors  ( [ ua],[vb ] ) .",
    "we now introduce a four - outcome measurement on alice s and bob s side , which will be used to generate the global randomness . with the help of the above inequality  ( [ forkineq ] )",
    ", we define a modified bell inequality similarly to equation  ( [ model ] ) in the main text as follows @xmath185 where @xmath135 is a strictly positive constant .",
    "the subtracted terms above will take care of aligning alice and bob s four - outcome measurements  ( [ rarb ] ) in the correct way ( i.e. force them to take a form having bloch vectors ( [ ua ] ) and ( [ vb ] ) ) .",
    "hence , in principle the probability @xmath160 can be approximated for all @xmath186 pairs provided @xmath170 tends to zero .    solving the above problem at order @xmath187 of the npa hierarchy we get a 121-dimensional moment matrix . by taking @xmath188 and @xmath189 ,",
    "the problem in this level can be solved on a desktop , and our technique certifies @xmath190 bits of global randomness .",

    "<S> by performing local projective measurements on a two - qubit entangled state one can certify in a device - independent way up to one bit of randomness . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that general measurements , defined by positive - operator - valued measures , can certify up to two bits of randomness , which is the optimal amount of randomness that can be certified from an entangled bit . </S>",
    "<S> general measurements thus provide an advantage over projective ones for device - independent randomness certification .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - local correlations observed when measuring entangled quantum particles certify the presence of intrinsic randomness in the measurement outputs in a way that is independent on the underlying physical realization of these correlations . </S>",
    "<S> while this relation between nonlocality and randomness had been noted by different authors since the seminal work by bell  @xcite , it is only recently that the tools to quantify the intrinsic randomness produced in bell setups were provided  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these tools were initially introduced in the context of device - independent randomness generation  @xcite , but have also allowed us to obtain a much better understanding of the relation between randomness and bell violations , two of the most fundamental properties of quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , today we know that maximal randomness can be certified from arbitrarily small amounts of non - locality or entanglement  @xcite , or that maximal randomness certification is possible in quantum theory , but not in general theories restricted only by the no - signalling principle  @xcite .    despite all this progress , there are still fundamental questions on the relation between randomness , non - locality , and entanglement that remain completely unexplored . in this work we consider and solve one of them : we obtain the maximal amount of randomness that can be certified in a standard bell scenario involving local measurements on one entangled bit or @xmath0 . in order to achieve this maximum </S>",
    "<S> the use of general measurement beyond projective ones , often known as positive - operator - valued measures ( povm ) , is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our results and techniques are also interesting because they provide one of the few examples in the context of bell non - locality where the use of these general measurements provides an advantage over standard projective measurements ( other examples can be found in  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we formulate the relation between randomness and non - locality in the setting of _ non - local guessing games _ as considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such games consist of two users , alice and bob , and an adversary eve . </S>",
    "<S> alice and bob perform local measurements on two separate quantum systems , labelled by @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> there are @xmath3 and @xmath4 possible measurements on particles @xmath1 and @xmath2 , each producing @xmath5 and @xmath6 possible results . </S>",
    "<S> measurement choices are labelled by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , while the corresponding results are labelled by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of alice and bob s systems is characterized by the finite set of @xmath15 probabilities @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the probability that outcomes @xmath11 and @xmath12 are obtained when performing measurements @xmath7 and @xmath8 on particles @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in our non - local guessing game , @xmath18 is assumed to be given , i.e. it is a promise on the behavior of alice s and bob s systems . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is for eve to guess as well as possible alice s outcome for a certain input @xmath19 . to achieve this </S>",
    "<S> , eve can prepare alice s and bob s system in any way compatible with the given behavior @xmath18 and the laws of quantum physics . a strategy @xmath20 for eve </S>",
    "<S> consists in @xmath21 a tripartite quantum state @xmath22 on a composite hilbert space @xmath23 of arbitrary dimension characterizing the possible correlations between alice s , bob s and eve s system , @xmath24 for each value of @xmath7 , a povm @xmath25 on @xmath26 with elements @xmath27 and for each value of @xmath8 , a povm @xmath28 on @xmath29 with elements @xmath30 characterizing the local measurements of alice and bob , @xmath31 a povm @xmath32 on @xmath33 with elements @xmath34 whose result is eve s best guess on alice s outcome . </S>",
    "<S> such a strategy is compatible with @xmath18 if @xmath35 the figure of merit of the game is the probability that alice s output and eve s guess coincide , maximized over all strategies @xmath20 compatible with @xmath18 ( a set which we denote @xmath36 ) : @xmath37 we refer to this quantity as the _ local guessing probability_.    we can also introduce a variant of the game in which eve attempts to guess both alice s and bob s outputs for a given pair of inputs @xmath38 in which case her strategies involve a povm @xmath32 with elements @xmath39 and the figure of merit is @xmath40 we refer to this quantity as the _ global guessing probability_.    the local and global guessing probabilities quantify the predictability of the result of measurement @xmath19 , or of pair of measurements @xmath19 and @xmath41 , by a quantum observer with an optimal description of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> taking minus the logarithm in base two of these quantities gives a measure of randomness expressed in bits . </S>",
    "<S> a bound on these quantities is often a central element in the analysis of actual randomness generation of expansion protocols , such as @xcite , where it directly determines ( up to statistical corrections ) the final amount of randomness generated .    </S>",
    "<S> note that we always have @xmath42 and @xmath43 since a simple strategy is for eve to simply guess the most probable outcomes of alice s and bob s measurements without exploiting any further detailed information about alice s and bob s systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , in general a non - trivial strategy performs strictly better than these trivial bounds . note that the guessing probabilities satisfy a convexity property in the sense that if @xmath18 admits the convex decomposition @xmath44 in term of quantum realizable behaviors @xmath45 , then @xmath46 and similarly for @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the fact that a strategy that eve can follow is to prepare alice s and bob s system with probability @xmath48 according to the behavior @xmath45 and use the optimal guessing strategy associated to @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular in the case in which the given correlations @xmath18 can be described by a local model , i.e. can be written down as a convex mixture of deterministic behaviors , one has @xmath49 and @xmath50 for any measurement @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the violation of bell inequalities does not necessarily imply that @xmath51 or @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> upper - bounds on the guessing probabilities can be computed using the navascues - pironio - acin ( npa ) hierarchy for quantum correlations  @xcite , as shown in @xcite .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to compute the maximal randomness that one can certify from one ebit . </S>",
    "<S> that is , our goal is to identify the correlations minimising the guessing probability among all those attainable by measuring an entangled state equal in its schmidt form to @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained quantity defines the optimal amount of randomness that can be certified in a device - independent way using an entangled qubit .    </S>",
    "<S> local measurements on such a state can always be viewed as povms acting on a qubit since the local schmidt dimension is 2 . in the case where the local qubit measurements are projective </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that 1 bit of local randomness @xcite and 2 bits of global randomness @xcite can be certified from an ebit . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the maximum that can be achieved under such measurements , since a qubit projective measurement has only two possible outcomes . beating those bounds </S>",
    "<S> thus requires considering more general measurements , beyond projective .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by stating a rather straightforward observation : no more than @xmath54 bits of local randomness and @xmath55 bits of global randomness can be certified by measuring an entangled state of dimension @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the convexity property of the guessing probabilities mentioned above and the fact that a povm acting on a space of dimension @xmath57 can always be decomposed as a convex sum of povms of at most @xmath58 outputs  @xcite , which can evidently contain at most @xmath54 bits of randomness . in the case of qubits , </S>",
    "<S> no more than 2 bits of local randomness and 4 bits of global randomness can be certified , i.e. twice as much than using projective measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> our main result is to construct two examples of qubit correlations saturating this bound on the local randomness . </S>",
    "<S> they thus provide examples of optimal randomness certification from one ebit . in the first example </S>",
    "<S> we prove analytically that the local randomness is 2 bits , while in the second we have to resort to semidefinite programming ( sdp ) techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> _ first optimal construction_ our first construction is based on non - local correlations obtained by measuring the two - qubit maximally entangled state @xmath59 with measurements @xmath60 on alice s side corresponding to @xmath61 and with measurements @xmath62 on bob s side corresponding to @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements are chosen so that they produce the maximal violation of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality  @xcite with all the possible pairs of measurements on the first particle , that is @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> finally a four - output measurement @xmath67 is included on the second particle . </S>",
    "<S> this seventh measurement by bob plays a special role in our construction as it is the one used to certify the two random bits . </S>",
    "<S> we denote it by @xmath68 , for random , and its measurement operators by @xmath69 , with @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement is rather generic but has to satisfy two requirements : ( i ) it is extremal in the set of qubit measurements and ( ii ) its measurement operators are such that @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> an example of such a measurement is given by a povm where @xmath72 and the bloch vectors corresponding to @xmath73 point to the direction of a tetrahedron .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements described above define the behavior @xmath18 which eve has to reproduce ( possibly using other quantum realizations of arbitrary dimension ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the four - output measurement @xmath68 , when acting on half of a maximally entangled state , gives @xmath74 for all @xmath12 and thus @xmath75 . as mentioned previously , this is only a trivial upper bound on the amount of intrinsic randomness , which is generally far from being tight . </S>",
    "<S> however , we now prove that for the correlations @xmath18 defined above the bound is tight and , therefore , @xmath76 and hence two - bits of local randomness can be certified from @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> to understand the main intuition behind the choice of state and measurements in our construction , the idea is to exploit the fact that , roughly speaking , the only quantum way of getting the maximal quantum violation of the chsh inequality , also known as the tsirelson s bound , is by performing anti - commuting measurements on a two - qubit maximally entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to these quantum correlations , which are unique , as tsirelson correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations generated in the previous quantum setup contain three blocks of tsirelson correlations for the different pairs of settings on particle @xmath1 and corresponding measurements on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the only state and measurements that could have produced these correlations should be , up to local unitary transformations , precisely pauli measurements @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath32 on @xmath1 acting on a two - qubit maximally entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> now , these three measurements when acting on half of a maximally entangled state allow reconstructing any measurement implemented on the other half . </S>",
    "<S> in fact they remotely project particle @xmath2 onto the eigenstates of these three observables , which are tomographically complete . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it should be possible from the observed correlations to reconstruct and certify the povm elements implemented on @xmath2 and conclude that they certify the desired amount of randomness . as we will see , this intuition is not entirely true due to a problem with complex conjugation , but it is enough to prove the desired result . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we believe this construction is interesting per se and may find applications in other problems of certification and self - testing of quantum devices .    after providing this intuition , </S>",
    "<S> let us now show that the given setup indeed certifies two bits of local randomness . </S>",
    "<S> as described earlier , any quantum strategy of eve corresponds to a tripartite state @xmath22 , a set of three observables @xmath79 for alice , six two - output observables @xmath80 and one four - output measurement @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy should reproduce the given correlations @xmath18 , as expressed ( [ qcorr ] ) , and thus also the chsh expectations @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies , given the self - testing property of the chsh inequality @xcite and following mosca - mckague @xcite , that up to a local isometry @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition @xmath84 and similarly @xmath85 . on the other hand , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is hermitian and unitary . </S>",
    "<S> basically this states that the three observables @xmath79 are necessarily the pauli measurements @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath32 acting on alice s system , except for @xmath88 for which a correction @xmath87 is needed . </S>",
    "<S> this correction reflects the fact that the optimal measurements leading to the three maximal chsh expectations given above are only defined up to a complex conjugation ( see @xcite for a discussion of this point ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now determine the action of the povm @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity of notation , let us denote it @xmath89 and the corresponding outcome operators @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations between the outcomes of this povm and alice s observables should equal those of the ideal set - up defined earlier , as expressed in ( [ qcorr ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath91 , where @xmath92 denotes the identity operator .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now note that the ideal povm elements @xmath69 used in the definition of @xmath18 can be written as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the basis of the four pauli operators and @xmath95 are complex coefficients defining the povm . we then have @xmath96 , hence @xmath97 .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath98 acts jointly on systems @xmath99 , without loss of generality we can decompose its operators as @xmath100 , where @xmath94 is the basis of the four pauli operators on @xmath2 and @xmath101 are arbitrary hermitian operators on @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> inserting these expressions for @xmath90 and using the specific form of @xmath103 and @xmath79 enforced by the chsh constraints , we find @xmath104 in the case @xmath105 and @xmath106 when @xmath107 .    </S>",
    "<S> introduce the normalized states @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the projector on the @xmath110 eigenspace of @xmath87 and @xmath111 is the projector corresponding to eve s outcome @xmath112 ( without generality we can assume eve s </S>",
    "<S> measurement @xmath32 to be projective ) . we can then write @xmath113\\label{povm1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath114 and @xmath115\\label{povm2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath107 , where we have defined the coefficients @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> note that these coefficients define a family of valid qubit povms @xmath117 with operators @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> these povms simply correspond to preparing an ancilla system @xmath102 in the state @xmath119 and performing the povm @xmath89 on the joint system @xmath99 .    </S>",
    "<S> now redefine @xmath120 as above but with the sign of @xmath121 changed . </S>",
    "<S> then this also defines valid povms , which are just the the complex conjugates of @xmath117 . with this redefinition , we can now write eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ povm1 ] ) and ( [ povm2 ] ) as @xmath122 for @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> we can interpret this as providing a convex decomposition for the ideal povm @xmath68 in term of the povms @xmath117 with respective weights @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> but since this povm is extremal , we must have @xmath125 for all @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular @xmath127 for all @xmath126 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us now rewrite the guessing probability for the input @xmath67 with these notations . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath128 which provide the two announced random bits .    </S>",
    "<S> _ second optimal construction_ our second construction to generate two random bits from a qubit is slightly simpler but the certification of randomness makes use of the numerical sdp techniques introduced in  @xcite based on the npa hierarchy for quantum correlations  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the construction is based on the elegant bell inequality introduced in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined in a scenario involving three measurements on alice s side and four on bob s . </S>",
    "<S> all measurements have two outputs and the inequality reads @xmath129 the maximal known quantum violation of the inequality is equal to @xmath130 and is obtained with a maximally entangled state , projective measurements @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 on alice , while bob s projective measurements are defined by the four vectors of a tetrahedron . in appendix </S>",
    "<S> a , we show that this known quantum violation is in fact optimal , which gives a new tsirelson - type bound for quantum correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a four outcome measurement @xmath68 , but now on alice s side . as </S>",
    "<S> above , this measurement will be used to generate the two random bits . </S>",
    "<S> given these configuration of measurements , we define the modified elegant bell inequality @xmath134 where @xmath135 is an arbitrary strictly positive constant . as </S>",
    "<S> the last term in the inequality is always negative , the bound follows from the bound on @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> the same argument implies that the quantum violation can not be larger than @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> if we use the known optimal qubit settings , given above , the only way of getting this maximal violation is if the povm elements of measurement @xmath68 are anti - aligned with the four projective measurements on bob s side , so that all probabilities @xmath137 are zero . </S>",
    "<S> but then , the corresponding measurement , when acting on half of a maximally entangled state , define two random bits on alice s side . the intuition , then , is that the maximal violation of the modified elegant bell inequality should certify the generation of two random bits for measurement @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> we used the numerical techniques in  @xcite to bound the randomness present in the correlations maximally violating  . recall that these techniques are based on sdp and , therefore , one has control over the precision of the numerical result . using these techniques at order @xmath138 with an arbitrary - precision solver  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we can show that the generated randomness by measurement @xmath68 in the previous setup is larger than @xmath139 bits .    </S>",
    "<S> _ noise robustness_ the numerical approach of  @xcite also allows one to study the robustness of the previous constructions against noise . </S>",
    "<S> a typical noise model consists of mixing , with weights @xmath140 and @xmath141 , with @xmath142 , the ideal quantum correlations with uncorrelated noise in which all outputs have the same probability . by decreasing @xmath140 , often known as visibility , the amount of certified randomness decreases . in figure  [ noise_sensitivity ] </S>",
    "<S> we plot a lower bound on the generated randomness as a function of the visibility for the two previous constructions . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the gain provided by the povm is fragile , in the sense that a small fraction of noise , of the order of 0.01 , makes the obtained randomness smaller than one bit , which is the randomness provided by projective measurements . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations are relevant , for instance , when thinking of a possible experiment showing the advantage of using povm s for randomness certification . </S>",
    "<S> a natural open question opened by our work is thus to identify robust setups for randomness generation using povm s .     of the guessing probability ) as a function of the visibility @xmath140 ranging from 0.85 to 1.0 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations are of the form @xmath143 , where @xmath144 are the quantum correlations yielding the maximum violation of the respective inequalities , and @xmath145 denotes the completely unbiased correlations that assign the same probability to each measurement outcome . </S>",
    "<S> the figure was obtained using level 2 of the npa hierarchy and thus only represents a lower bound on the maximal randomness ( note for instance that we do not recover the optimal values of 2 bits for @xmath146 ) . better noise resistance than the one provided by these curves </S>",
    "<S> may thus be obtained by performing a more complex analysis . ]    </S>",
    "<S> _ global randomness_ before concluding , we would like to briefly discuss the problem of global randomness . </S>",
    "<S> the question is whether it is possible to find bell setups involving a pair of maximally entangled qubits allowing the generation of @xmath147 bits of randomness . </S>",
    "<S> we mainly leave this question for future work . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we made some preliminary numerical searches , using slightly more complex variations of the previous construction based on the elegant bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> these constructions are described in appendix b. as shown there , they can be used to certify the generation of 2.8997 bits , which is both higher than the global randomness that can be certified with projective measurements and the local randomness that can be certified with general measurements .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions_ we have shown that an ebit can certify the presence of more than one bit of randomness locally and more than two bits globally . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of local randomness , we have found two constructions that can certify 2 bits of randomness , the maximal possible value . </S>",
    "<S> both constructions involve a maximally entangled state and the three pauli measurements on alice s side . in the first construction , the violation of three chsh inequalities are used to self - test the maximally entangled state and these three pauli measurements on alice s side . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn allows to self - test a four - outcome extremal povm on bob s , which generates the two bits of local randomness . </S>",
    "<S> our second construction is instead based on a single inequality  the elegant inequality introduced in @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we had to resort to sdp techniques to put a bound on the local randomness . </S>",
    "<S> a possible way to proof this bound analytically , would be to first proof that the elegant bell inequality also provides a self - test for the maximally entangled state and the three pauli measurements on alice s side . </S>",
    "<S> it would then be possible to add the four - outcome measurement on bob s side and use the same proof as above to conclude that it generates two random bits .    </S>",
    "<S> both constructions are quite sensitive to noise , as a fraction of noise of the order of 0.01 makes the obtained randomness smaller than one bit , which can already be obtained with more robust constructions based on projective measurements . </S>",
    "<S> a natural open question is thus to identify robust and optimal setups for randomness certification using povm s .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also found a construction based on povms which yields more than two bits of global randomness , the best that can be obtained with projective measurements , but less than the theoretical maximum of four bits . </S>",
    "<S> it remains an open question whether this maximum can actually be attained .    _ </S>",
