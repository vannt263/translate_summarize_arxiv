    "as already loosely described in the introduction , we consider a continuous - variable system which is coupled to two pointers , see fig .",
    "[ fig : measurement ] .",
    "this coupling is chosen in such a way that the position of the system to be measured moves ( or , in another phrasing , `` kicks '' @xcite ) the position of the first pointer whereas the corresponding momentum moves the position of the second pointer .",
    "we can therefore deduce information about the system from a projective measurement of the pointer positions after the coupling interaction .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this model can be found in refs .",
    "we closely follow these references and just recall those results which are essential for the present study .    , and the pointers , described by the bipartite state @xmath0 , interact with each other by means of an interaction hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "after the interaction process at time @xmath2 , a projective measurement of the pointer positions @xmath3 and @xmath4 is performed .",
    "an appropriate choice of @xmath1 enforces that the measurable values of the pointer observables are related to the system s initial position and momentum .",
    "hence , both of the latter can be retrieved from these measurement results .",
    "a fundamental question is therefore whether we can quantify the quantum uncertainty of such a simultaneous measurement by using the concept of an entropy . ]",
    "the total system is initially prepared in the state @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the system to be measured and @xmath0 represents the bipartite state of the two pointers .",
    "the coupling between system and pointers is described by the interaction hamiltonian @xcite @xmath7 with constant coupling strengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 in an appropriate scaling ( i.e.  @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote position and momentum of the system , respectively , whereas @xmath13 and @xmath14 indicate the momenta of either one of the two pointers .",
    "it is the bilinear construction of the interaction hamiltonian which is responsible for the behavior described above : the observable values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 move the positions of the first and second pointer , respectively .",
    "this is not surprising since eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) bears a strong resemblance to the displacement operator @xcite .",
    "however , the complete pointer dynamics are not immediately clear due to the mutual feedback of the three systems involved .      to understand the measurement coupling dynamics , we solve the corresponding heisenberg equations for the positions @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the pointers . for this purpose",
    "we assume that the interaction energy is much larger than the kinetic energy ( e.g. , realized by a short but strong interaction between the system to be measured and the pointers ) and we can therefore neglect free dynamics . for a given interaction time @xmath2",

    "[ sec : concepts of pointer - based simultaneous measurements ] , on pointer states which are initially localized states in phase - space and can be kicked by the system state to imprint its information on them as a displacement in position . therefore , it is reasonable to use vacuum states , or , more generally , squeezed states as initial pointer states . historically , such states have already been used in ref .",

    "we remark that the lowest possible collective entropy of a pointer - based simultaneous measurement with squeezed pointer states , i.e.  @xmath110 , can be reached with a squeezed system state which obeys eq .",

    "the constant bound , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wehrl ] ) , is apparently equivalent to this lowest limit .",
    "this result corresponds to the derivation of eq .",

    "in this final section we outline the most important results of this contribution and take a look at several aspects which still leave room for further considerations .",
    "we have analyzed a whole family of entropic uncertainty relation for pointer - based simultaneous measurements .",
    "this family includes specific cases which have been known previously .",
    "however , it has also allowed us to eliminate the influence of the system state to be measured from the bound while not neglecting the influence of the measurement setup .",
    "this has led us to the optimal bound which is equal to the collective entropy of minimal entropy states .",
    "such minimal entropy states are the well - known squeezed vacuum states .      in the previous sections we imposed several limitations in order to simplify our mathematical expressions .",
    "in particular , we chose a linear interaction hamiltonian with constant coupling strengths , squeezed pointer states and pure system states to describe the simultaneous measurement . furthermore , we neglected free dynamics of all systems involved . in the following we discuss which of these limitations may be loosened .",
    "linearity of the interaction hamiltonian is a crucial point of our discussion . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that higher order interaction terms only lead to corrections which are smaller than the main contribution of the linear term",
    ". therefore , our coupling model should be able to describe the key features of pointer - based measurements and consequently allows us to discuss the associated noise of the measurement apparatus in terms of entropies .",
    "it is , however , possible to generalize our considerations to time - dependent coupling strengths , which results in a more complicated expression for the noise terms @xcite .",

    "( [ eqn : noise ] ) . ]    using general pointer states instead of squeezed pointer states prevents us from applying lieb s theorem and we have to fall back onto different entropic uncertainty relations .",
    "for example , we could use a linearization approach to find an entropic bound , but there are also other possibilities ( with @xmath113 ) , and is , e.g. , valid due to the monotonicity of rnyi entropies , see a. rnyi , in _ proceedings of the fourth berkeley symposium on mathematical statistics and probability _ , vol . 1 ( university of california , berkeley , 1961 ) pp .",

    "lastly , extending our framework to mixed states for system and pointers requires us to rewrite most definitions and therefore can not be further discussed here .",
    "the underlying limitation is related to the fact that we use a projective measurement to read out the pointer observables .",
    "a more physical approach would incorporate an environment to which the pointers are coupled @xcite . by doing so",
    ", the pointer observables could emerge purely by decoherence effects .",
    "density matrices instead of pure states would appear naturally .",
