    "for those about to embark on the study of this paper , let us start with a warning : this article is not a report on ground - breaking results . neither will we present spanking new circuits , ripe for patent . rather in spirit of sm@xmath0acd s explicit policy to be `` a forum for the discussion of new ideas and methodologies ''",
    ", we would like to advocate the introduction of computer algebra into the design process of analog circuits . in order to do this , we present some examples , where computer algebra ( together with numerics ) was used in the design , especially the sizing of the given circuits .",
    "these examples do not represent a systematic approach , but they should be considered as tentative steps towards getting to know the capabilities ( and some of the shortcomings ) of computer algebra systems ( cas ) , and making these tools bring forth fruit in the daily work of electrical engineers .",
    "one of the principal problems in analog circuit design is to determine element values in a given circuit in such a way that the resulting network function is in accordance with some previously given performance specifications . in more mathematical terms",
    ": suppose the network function is demanded to be a rational function of form @xmath1 with the numbers @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 determined by the initial specifications .",
    "then we need to find an analog circuit @xmath5 built from elements , which themselves are described by parameters @xmath6 , such that its network function @xmath7 where the terms @xmath8 and @xmath9 are polynomials in @xmath10 satisfies @xmath11 in other words : at the end of the day , many design problems result in a system of nonlinear equations",
    "@xmath12    @xmath13 and @xmath14 for variables @xmath15    if indeed the terms @xmath16 are polynomials with coefficients in some number field , the set of solutions , otherwise also known as the zero set of ( [ designproblem ] ) , forms what is called an _",
    "affine algebraic variety _ , an object which belongs to the mathematical subdiscipline of _ algebraic geometry .",
    "_ thus when trying to solve these equations , we could profit both from the centuries of experience , mathematicians have gained in this particular field , and from the more recent results and algorithmic instruments developed  the concept of _ grbner bases , _ as well as the _ buchberger algorithm _ and its `` relatives '' which are realized in nearly all of the current computer algebra systems .",
    "the result would be exact ( `` symbolic '' ) descriptions of the sought after solution sets , from which we could deduce numeric results afterwards .",
    "now , when we take a look at the advances in symbolic methods applied to circuit design , we can make a peculiar observation : nowadays it has become nearly routine to calculate any given network function as a multivariable rational function of the complex frequency @xmath17 and the symbolic circuit elements ( even though there is still the problem of the combinatorial explosion for large circuits ) .",
    "however , when it comes to finding solutions for the nonlinear equations arising from the task of sizing a particular circuit , even if it is relatively small , researchers , as well as designers , fall back upon numerical means and various approximative methods with their various drawbacks .",
    "in section 6.3.3 .  of @xcite the following filter circuit was presented :        the aim there was to construct a fourth order butterworth filter with this topology .",
    "using one of the available symbolic analysis programs , we see that the circuits symbolic transfer function is given by @xmath18 with @xmath19 being a polynomial , and    -2em @xmath20    in order to specify element values in such a way that @xmath21 becomes the transfer function of a fourth order butterworth filter , we can proceed from these data by matching the coefficients with those numerical values , which can be found in any table for filter design , and then try to solve the resulting equations by numerical means . since we only have four equations for nine unknowns ,",
    "there is the need to reduce the existing degrees of freedom by more or less arbitrarily attaching numerical values to some of the element values .",
    "in fact , that is what was done in @xcite , where @xmath22 was set equal to @xmath23 and all the @xmath24 were set to @xmath25 ( all element values in this example are considered to be normalized ) ; afterwards some variant of the newton - raphson method was used , to deduce one single solution .",
    "the disadvantages of such an approach are obvious : using rounded values ( from precalculated tables ) introduces errors right from the start .",
    "both , the assignment of ( quite arbitrary ) numbers to arbitrarily chosen parameters , and the choice of a starting vector for the newton - raphson method might hinder from finding a solution , or even worse , might make a solution impossible    furthermore , questions like `` do alternatives exist ?",
    "how many are there ? '' , can not be answered either , and changing any of the numerical parameters forces us to redo most of the calculations .    when we tried to solve this design task , first of all we started with a slightly different approach , using the feldtkeller equation @xmath26 for the special case of the fourth order butterworth filter .",
    "thus we got rid of the precalculated approximate values for the @xmath27 by using instead the defining algebraic equations given by matching the coefficients from @xmath28 with @xmath29 consequently we enlarged the set of equations ( [ 4filterglg ] ) by adding @xmath30 to it , and regarding @xmath31 as further unknowns .",
    "even though in this paper we propose the usage of the algebraic capabilities of a cas , at this point we used mathematica ( version 6.0.1.0 ) as a numerical engine  not in order to approximate one solution , but to find approximates for * all * solutions .",
    "moreover as was done in @xcite , we also fix @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 since obviously the enlargement of the set of equations results in a bigger set of solutions , we were left with the final task of `` post - processing ''",
    "this zero set , by singling out those particular solutions for which @xmath35 determine a polynomial @xmath36 , all of whose zeroes have negative real part (= filter stability ) , and such that all the @xmath37 are _ non - negative _ (= realizability by classic elements ) .",
    "indeed , we observe that from all the possible solutions calculated , only nine satisfy the restrictions concerning the @xmath27 and again only one of these , @xmath38 results in the @xmath37 all being positive .",
    "so , where does computer algebra enter this picture ?    first of all mathematica s nsolve - procedure , which we used in the above task , at its core heavily depends on algebraic algorithms : the fact that it is able to calculate _ all _ solutions stems from the algebraic variety , which was defined by ( [ 4filterglg ] ) and ( [ bw ] ) , being _",
    "zero dimensional_. that is , it consists of finitely many points .",
    "again we can be sure of this fact , only because there is an algorithm  the _ buchberger algorithm ) . ] _  which is used by mathematica as a subprocedure of nsolve and which for any system of algebraic equations produces particularly well - behaved equivalent systems of equations ",
    "so - called _ grbner bases _  which allow much more insight into the properties of the zero set , and may be used for a subsequent elimination of variables .",
    "thus e.g. , when we apply mathematica s groebnerbasis - command to ( [ 4filterglg ] ) and ( [ bw ] ) , with the values of @xmath39 fixed as above , and the variables ordered lexicographically by @xmath40 ( which amounts to saying that first @xmath41 is to be eliminated , then @xmath42 etc . ) , then the resulting grbner basis contains the polynomial    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    in @xmath51 of degree @xmath52 which implies that there are only finitely many possible values for @xmath53 furthermore this grbner basis contains polynomials @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 each of which being linear in the respective @xmath57 and otherwise consisting only of a high degree polynomial in @xmath53 since these polynomials as part of a grbner basis have to be zero , too , consequently each zero of @xmath58 determines precisely one solution vector @xmath59 .",
    "those solutions , which result in the additional specifications for the @xmath60 to be fulfilled , originate from a factor of the polynomial @xmath58 of degree @xmath61 which can be calculated using mathematica s factor - procedure , when we allow the coefficients to be sums of integers and integer multiples of @xmath62 this factor polynomial is -1em @xmath63 substituting @xmath64 we see that its structure is effectively determined by a polynomial of degree @xmath65 which results in the number of admissable solutions being nine .",
    "to finish this section , let us remark that by modifying the feldtkeller equation to @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the fourth order chebyshev polynomial , and slightly changing the initial values for the @xmath68 after some trial - and - error we were able to calculate the following set of parameter values , with which we can make the initially given circuit into a chebyshev filter @xmath69    the question remains for each filter characteristic : which set of prescribed values for @xmath70 imply solutions for @xmath71 which make sense in an electrical engineering point of view , i.e. , for which positive @xmath70 do we get positive @xmath72 ?",
    "from @xcite - a students textbook in analog electronics - we take our next example : a rudimentary bjt amplifier circuit with only a few additional classic elements for biasing and sizing purposes ( see figure ( [ naundorfpicture ] ) ) .    -.4",
    "cm -1em   -0.4 cm [ naundorfpicture ]    -2em    the biasing resistances are given by @xmath73 and @xmath74 the biased transistor is modelled by concrete h - parameters @xmath75 and its capacitances @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .    with denoting its transfer function by @xmath78 a full symbolic analysis with sapwin 3.0 .",
    "gives @xmath79 and @xmath80 with @xmath81 with regard to the concretely given transistor parameters at the bias point , the nominator and denominator of @xmath21 become @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "thus , e.g.  setting @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 we get @xmath87 the poles being ( approximately ) @xmath88 this results in the bode plot shown in figure [ naundorf1 ] .     -0.4 cm",
    "-0.4 cm    we will now use this example as a problem in circuit design .",
    "our task shall be : with the bias point remaining unchanged , find parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 in such a way that a new transfer function @xmath91 is achieved , which has the same zeroes as @xmath92 and possesses two ( new ) poles @xmath93 and @xmath94 . introducing a new parameter @xmath95 ( since due to the simplicity of our design topology",
    ", we can not specify the maximal attenuation of @xmath96 as we will see below ) , we thus are asked to determine the parameters @xmath97 and @xmath90 in such a way that @xmath98 this is equivalent to @xmath99 factoring out common terms on both sides of the @xmath100-sign , we are left with a third order polynomial in @xmath17 with coefficients being integer polynomials in the variables @xmath101 to solve ( [ naundorfdesign ] ) we need to set these coefficients to zero , which consequently results in the following system of four algebraic equations since we consider @xmath93 and @xmath94 to be fixed . ] ( the @xmath102-th equation resulting from the coefficient of @xmath103 ) : -1em @xmath104    alhough this system is nonlinear , using its procedure solve , mathematica is able to calculate four symbolic solutions for @xmath97 and @xmath90 as functions of @xmath93 and @xmath105 voicing the explicit caveat : `` equations may not give solutions for all `` solve '' variables . '' .",
    "nevertheless , indeed there are only four different solutions .",
    "the first is irrelevant for the concrete problem at hand from an electrical engineering point of view , since it is given by @xmath106 and thus results in a trivial transfer function .    the second one",
    ", though it leads to nontrivial terms for @xmath107 and @xmath108 furthermore implies @xmath109 which again has to be considered absurd from an engineering point of view .",
    "finally , there are two solutions left which lead to two different valid sets of design parameters , both of them having in common that @xmath110    here we will not present the explicit formulas for @xmath111 but we will give a numerical example , and we will further show , how the formulas for @xmath112 ( and beyond this our claim , that there are only four solutions ) can be derived with the help of grbner bases .    first , for the numerical example let @xmath113 and @xmath114 then the two remaining approximate solutions of the above set of equations are @xmath115 and @xmath116    indeed , the corresponding bode plots for the respective circuits can be seen in figure 4 .    ) ( dashed ) , and ( [ drei ] ) ( thick),title=\"fig : \" ] -0.4",
    "cm    [ bode3 ]    finally , applying mathematica s groebnerbasis - command to the right - hand sides of equations ( [ naundorfglg ] ) , with the order of variables chosen to be @xmath117 results in a grbner basis consisting of @xmath118 polynomials with exactly one of them containing only the variables @xmath119 this particular polynomial is of degree four in the variable @xmath120 keeping in mind that the zero set of the original polynomials constituting ( [ naundorfglg ] ) is equal to the zero set of its grbner basis , we thus see that there truly are only four possibilities for the values of @xmath120    factoring this particular polynomial ( again with the help of mathematica ) we get the following factors : @xmath121 further analysis shows that @xmath122 results in @xmath123 and the solution of the linear ( with respect to @xmath90 ) equation implies the negative value of @xmath112 according to ( [ mies ] ) . thus the two solutions , whose existence we claimed above , have their origin in the quadratic equation ( [ qq ] ) .",
    "symbolic methods always suffer from one major deficiency  the `` combinatorial explosion '' of terms  which most of the time results in both , a massive , nearly insatiable demand for space , and an extraordinary high amount of computing time .",
    "this observation also applies to all grbner basis methods : it is known that by necessity the problem of finding a grbner basis in the general case needs an exponential amount of space . on the other hand , in recent years",
    "there have been major improvements with regard to the run - time behaviour of the original buchberger algorithm , which have resulted in faster and thus more powerful algorithms to compute grbner bases .",
    "as we could see in the above examples , even moderately sized small circuits already give rise to mid - sized equations , which again  by way of the methods from computer algebra  result in even bigger symbolic expressions for the sought - after design parameters .",
    "thus the `` new toolbox '' computer algebra , the usage of which i try to recommend with this article , seems to be doomed from the start .",
    "still , bad behaviour _ in general _ does not mean that the instruments from computer algebra _",
    "always _ behave there might be classes of problems for which results are computed fast , or can be written down very economically . as electrical engineers know , there are close ( but in the author s opinion by far not completely understood ) connections between a circuit s topology and the algebraic structure of its network function , which may be taken advantage of with regard to design tasks .",
    "take on the other hand researchers in symbolic methods , who are accustomed with the phenomenon of swelling expressions arising in the analysis of circuits . as a workaround a number of them have proposed so - called `` sequences of expressions '' .",
    "it is interesting to note that even electrical engineers without experience in methods of symbolic analysis may already be well versed in this `` sequential approach '' , if only they knew classic filter theory , in particular the cauer canonical forms of @xmath124-circuits .    in form of an example , let us show , what we mean .",
    "suppose we are given an @xmath124-ladder network , consisting of three inductances and three capacitances , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "-.4 cm     -1 cm    as is well known its impedance @xmath125 can be described by a continued fraction @xmath126 that , in fact , is just short hand for a sequence of expressions .",
    "this can be seen by deducing ( [ frak ] ) with a process of alternatively combining impedances in series and in parallel .",
    "thus we have @xmath127 where @xmath128 denotes the impedance of the ladder circuit , with @xmath129 having been removed .",
    "further : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the impedance of the circuit , that is left , when @xmath129 and @xmath132 have been removed .",
    "continuing like this , taking away one more circuit element in each step , this process can be repeated , until we get to one last impedance @xmath133 ( which would just consist of @xmath134 ) .    reinserting the various @xmath135 we get @xmath136 and thus are able to calculate @xmath137",
    "when conversely one wants to realize an lc transimpedance function as an lc ladder , classic theory tells us to expand the given rational function into a continued fraction ( an algorithm which in case of rational functions always comes to an end after a finite number of steps ) and read off the element values directly from this expression , which according to theorems in classic filter theory all are positive .",
    "if we want to bring together the capabilities of a cas for solving algebraic equations and the sequence of expression approach in our example , we first observe that we can easily calculate the form of the intermediate impedances @xmath138 i.e.  we have @xmath139 with @xmath140 and the @xmath60 denoting polynomials in the circuit parameters @xmath141    a sensible design task would now be to specify an impedance function @xmath142 with real numbers @xmath143 and to demand @xmath144 analogously to the above example of the bjt amplifier , by matching coefficients , this results in six nonlinear equations , which have to be solved for the variables @xmath145 and @xmath146 here we only present the ( easy ) solution ( determined by mathematica again ) for the first step , which is -1.5em @xmath147 to calculate further element values , this procedure needs to be repeated for the other @xmath148 thus one has to solve next the equations resulting from @xmath149 where @xmath128 should still be described in terms of the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath131 is given by the ansatz @xmath150 with new unknowns @xmath151 this has to be continued until we have equations for each set of coefficients of @xmath135 in terms of the coefficients appearing in @xmath152 plus additional equations for the element values . starting from those equations , successive",
    "reinserting leads to the desired expressions for the element parameters .",
    "one has to concede that  compared to the traditional continued fraction expansion ",
    "this procedure looks very cumbersome .",
    "but in fact , if one looks a little bit closer , it is equivalent to repeatedly doing polynomial division as part of a continued fraction expansion",
    ". furthermore our approach might be generalized to other impedance functions which need not come from ladders , but still ultimately result from a sequence of series , respectively parallel reductions applied to the initially given circuit , i.e.  the process of replacing two impedances in series , or in parallel by a single equivalent impedance in series to a single resistance @xmath153 from the resulting equation @xmath154 when only given the value of @xmath153 we can not deduce uniquely the values of the @xmath155 . beyond this",
    "there is a further generalization to handle delta - wye and wye - delta transformations .    on the other hand by results from epifanov and truemper",
    ", it is known that every planar two terminal graph can be reduced to a single edge by these four kinds of transformations ( plus removing loops and pendant edges ) .",
    "moreover there is an algorithm , developed by feo and provan , which calculates the sequence of necessary graph transformations . since to each of these transformations there corresponds an equation , which gives the value of the resulting element(s ) in terms of the values of previously existing elements",
    ", there always is a _ sequence of equations _ which leads from the initially given element values to the driving point impedance of a planar two terminal circuit .",
    "circuit design for ( midsized to large ) planar two terminal circuits , which consist of impedances only , thus becomes the task of `` reversing '' these equations , in an analogous manner to what we did with lc ladders .",
    "the author of this paper firmly believes , that computer algebra systems will be a valuable tool in tackling this particular problem .",
    "the challenge remains to find classes of circuits for which the _ sequence of reversed equations _ can be effectively calculated , or to prove  what might be also possible , and would be an interesting result in itself  that , besides the classic , continued- or partial - fraction - topologies attached to the names of cauer and foster , no such further classes exist .",
