    "very high energy cosmic ray ( vhe cr ) antiprotons are an essential diagnostic tool to approach the solution of several big topics of cosmology , astrophysics and particle physics , besides for studying fundamental properties of the cr sources and propagation medium . the enigma of the matter / anti - matter asymmetry in the local universe , that of the existence of antimatter regions , the signatures of physics beyond the standard model of particles and fields , as well as the determination of the essential features of cr propagation in the insterstellar medium , these are only a few research topics which would greatly benefit from the detection of vhe antiprotons @xcite .",
    "cosmic rays are hampered by the moon , therefore a deficit of crs in its direction is expected ( the so - called _ ` moon shadow ' _ ) . moreover ,",
    "the earth - moon system acts as a magnetic spectrometer .",
    "in fact , due to the geomagnetic field ( gmf ) the moon shadow shifts westward by an amount depending on the primary cr energy . the paths of primary antiprotons are therefore deflected in the opposite sense in their way to the earth .",
    "this effect allows , in principle , the search for antiparticles in the opposite direction of the observed moon shadow .",
    "if the energy is low enough and the angular resolution good we can distinguish the two shadows , one shifted towards west due to the protons and the other shifted towards east due to the antiprotons . at high energies ( @xmath1 10 tev ) the magnetic deflection is too small compared to the angular resolution and",
    "the two shadows can not be disentangled . at low energies ( @xmath2500 gev )",
    "the shadows are much deflected but washed out by the poor angular resolution , thus the sensitivity is limited .",
    "therefore , there is an optimal energy window for the measurement of the antiproton abundance .",
    "the argo - ybj experiment is especially recommended for the measurement of the cr antimatter content via the observation of the galactic cr shadowing effect due to : ( 1 ) good angular resolution and pointing accuracy and their long term stability ; ( 2 ) low energy threshold ; ( 3 ) real sensitivity to the gmf .",
    "indeed , the low energy threshold of the detector allows the observation of the shadowing effect with a sensitivity of about 9 standard deviations ( s.d . ) per month at @xmath3tev energy .    in this paper",
    "we report the measurement of the @xmath4 ratio in the tev energy region with all the data collected during the period from july 2006 to november 2009 .",
    "the argo - ybj experiment , located at the yangbajing cosmic ray laboratory ( tibet , p.r .",
    "china , 4300 m a.s.l . , 606 g/@xmath5 ) , is currently the only air shower array exploiting the full coverage approach at high altitude , with the aim of studying the cosmic radiation at an energy threshold of a few hundred gev .    the detector is composed of a central carpet large @xmath374@xmath6 78 m@xmath7 , made of a single layer of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) with @xmath393@xmath8 of active area , enclosed by a guard ring partially ( @xmath320@xmath8 ) instrumented up to @xmath3100@xmath6110 m@xmath7 .",
    "the apparatus has modular structure , the basic data acquisition element being a cluster ( 5.7@xmath67.6 m@xmath7 ) , made of 12 rpcs ( 2.8@xmath61.25 m@xmath7 each ) .",
    "each chamber is read by 80 external strips of 6.75@xmath661.8 @xmath5 ( the spatial pixels ) , logically organized in 10 independent pads of 55.6@xmath661.8 @xmath5 which represent the time pixels of the detector .",
    "the read - out of 18360 pads and 146880 strips are the experimental output of the detector @xcite .",
    "the rpcs are operated in streamer mode by using a gas mixture ( ar 15% , isobutane 10% , tetrafluoroethane 75% ) for high altitude operation .",
    "the high voltage set at 7.2 kv ensures an overall efficiency of about 96% @xcite .",
    "the central carpet contains 130 clusters ( hereafter , argo-130 ) and the full detector is composed of 153 clusters for a total active surface of @xmath36700 m@xmath7 . a simple , yet powerful , electronic logic has been implemented to build an inclusive trigger .",
    "this logic is based on a time correlation between the pad signals depending on their relative distance . in this way , all the shower events giving a number of fired pads n@xmath9 n@xmath10 in the central carpet in a time window of 420 ns generate the trigger .",
    "this can work with high efficiency down to n@xmath10 = 20 , keeping the rate of random coincidences negligible .",
    "the whole system , in smooth data taking since july 2006 firstly with argo-130 , is in stable data taking with the full apparatus of 153 clusters since november 2007 with the trigger condition n@xmath10 = 20 and a duty cycle @xmath185% .",
    "the trigger rate is @xmath33.6 khz with a dead time of 4@xmath8 .",
    "the main results after about 3 years of stable operation are summarized in @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of the shower parameters is split into the following steps .",
    "first the shower core position is derived with the maximum likelihood method from the lateral density distribution of the secondary particles @xcite . in the second step , given the core position , the shower axis is reconstructed by means of an iterative un - weighted planar fit able to reject the time values belonging to the non - gaussian tails of the arrival time distributions .",
    "finally , a conical correction with a slope fixed to @xmath11 = 0.03 rad is applied to the surviving hits in order to improve the angular resolution @xcite . unlike the information on the plane surface , the conical correction is obtained via a weighted fit which lowers the contributions from delayed secondary particles , not belonging to the shower front . in detail , we firstly fit a conical surface to the shower image , by minimizing the sum of the squares of the time residual distribution . at this stage ,",
    "all the particles hitting the detector have the same weight w@xmath12=1 . after computing the rms of the time residuals with respect to such a conical surface",
    ", we set k = 2.5 rms as ` scale parameter ' and perform the minimization of the square of the time residuals weighted sum , where w@xmath12=1 if the particle is onward the shower front , w@xmath12=@xmath13 otherwise .",
    "@xmath14 is a common tukey biweight function .",
    "the fit procedure is iterated , refreshing every time the scale parameter , until the last reconstructed direction differs from the previous one less than 0.1@xmath15 .",
    "the analysis reported in this paper refers to events collected after the following selections : ( 1 ) more than 20 strips on the argo-130 carpet ; ( 2 ) zenith angle of the shower arrival direction less than 50@xmath16 ; ( 3 ) reconstructed core position inside a 150@xmath6150 m@xmath7 area centered on the detector .",
    "moreover a quality cut to remove misreconstructed events is applied . according to the simulation ,",
    "the median energy of the selected protons is e@xmath171.8 tev ( mode energy @xmath180.7 tev ) .",
    "a detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the cr propagation in the earth - moon system @xcite has been developed in order to estimate the expected antiproton flux in the side opposite to the cr moon shadow .",
    "the simulation is based on the real data acquisition time .",
    "the moon position has been computed at fixed times , starting from july 2006 up to november 2009 .",
    "such instants are distant 30 seconds each other . for each time , after checking that the data acquisition was effectively running and the moon was in the field of view , primaries were generated with arrival directions sampled within the moon disc basing on the effective exposure time .",
    "after accounting for the arrival direction correction due to the magnetic bending effect , the air shower development in the atmosphere has been generated by the corsika v. 6.500 code with qgsjet / gheisha models @xcite .",
    "cr spectra have been simulated in the energy range from 10 gev to 1 pev following the results given in @xcite .",
    "about 10@xmath19 showers have been sampled in the zenith angle interval 0 - 60 degrees .",
    "the secondary particles have been propagated down to cut - off energies of 1 mev ( electromagnetic component ) and 100 mev ( muons and hadrons ) .",
    "the experimental conditions ( trigger logic , time resolution , electronic noises , etc . ) have been reproduced by a geant4-based code @xcite .",

    "the simulated events have been generated in the same format used for the experimental data and analyzed with the same reconstruction code .",
    "for the analysis of the shadowing effect , the signal is collected within a 10@xmath2210@xmath16 sky region centered on the moon position .",

    "the background has been estimated with two different approaches , the _ time swapping _ and the _ equi - zenith angle _ methods , as described in @xcite , in order to investigate possible systematic uncertainties in the background calculation .",
    "the significance map is obtained from the event and background maps after applying a smoothing procedure to take into account the angular resolution of the detector @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the two background calculation methods has shown that they give results consistent with each other within 1 s.d ..    n@xmath2340 and zenith angle @xmath24 .",

    "the significance of the maximum deficit is about 22 s.d .. the observed westward displacement of the moon shadow by about 1.5@xmath16 allows to appreciate the sensitivity of the argo - ybj experiment to the gmf .",

    "of course , whichever matter - antiprotons combination is obtained , the total amount of triggered events must not be changed , so that the fitting procedure consists in transferring mc events from the crs to the antiproton shadow and comparing the result with the data .    to make such a comparison",

    "let @xmath28 be the proton shadow , obtained by imposing a given power law spectrum .",
    "the observed moon shadow should be expressed by the following function : @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) where the first term represents the deficit in crs and the second term represents the deficit in antiprotons .",
    "this function must be fitted to the data to obtain the best value of @xmath31 .",
    "we also applied a second method to determine the antiproton content in the cosmic radiation . without introducing functions to parameterize the expectations , we directly compared the mc signal with the data .",
