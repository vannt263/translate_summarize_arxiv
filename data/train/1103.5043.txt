    "rdf provides a simple declarative data model of triples @xmath0 to describe resources .",
    "the number of rdf data sets has increased in diverse areas of application such as bioinformatics , social networks , geographic locations , books or films .",
    "the _ _ linked data project _ _ has emerged as an initiative to promote the use of rdf to publish structured data on the web in a distributed and interconnected manner  @xcite . linked open data ( lod ) cloud estimations",
    "show that more than 25 billion rdf triples are available and interconnected by roughly 1 billion links .",
    "sparql is a declarative language recommended by the w3c for extracting information from rdf graphs .",
    "it proposes graph pattern matching facilities to perform searches and data extraction .",
    "for instance , it provides the possibility of extracting subgraphs using the ` construct ` keyword , or finding certain variable bindings using the ` select ` clause .",
    "the semantics and complexity of the sparql query language have been fairly studied theoretically , showing that sparql algebra has the same expressive power as relational algebra  @xcite , although their conversion is not trivial  @xcite .",
    "several works  @xcite explore efficient sparql evaluation methods based on query evaluation optimization  @xcite . some heuristics include triple pattern reordering based on selectivity estimation  @xcite , dynamically restricting triple patterns  @xcite , risc - style query processing  @xcite and optimization based on `` star shaped groups ''  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , different triple patterns around one or few common variables .",
    "some techniques focus on minimizing the processing time of joins . in  @xcite",
    ", subject - subject joins are assumed to be very frequent operations , and they can be carried out in linear time ( _ w.r.t . _ the size of the tables ) .",
    "multi - way joins can also be performed instead of multiple individual joins  @xcite .",
    "rdf store benchmarking has also conjectured about sparql special features to provide sets of representative queries  @xcite .",
    "a recent work  @xcite motivates the need of characterizing lod usage patterns and analyzing who utilizes the information and how .",
    "this knowledge helps understand which resources are more useful and allows to adapt lod repositories to suit the real needs of the users . this study highlights the peculiarities of analyzing lod web server logs compared to the well - known traditional web log analysis . for instance , it compares the proportion of accesses to the two views of the same resource : the traditional human html view , and the semantic rdf perspective . ultimately , it performs a basic analysis of a set of sparql queries , counting the type of queries and triple patterns .",
    "the main objective of this work is analyzing real - world sparql queries to depict what kind of accesses the users perform , focusing on those clauses that are more expensive in terms of query evaluation , both from planification and index access points of view .",
    "this study is data - set - independent , in the sense that anyone could follow our methodology to analyze any sparql log , querying any rdf data set , supported by any rdf store or query engine .",
    "we consider that our study may assist the designers of indices , stores , optimizers and benchmarks in making reasonable assumptions and taking plausible decisions .    in section  [ s : sla ]",
    ", we first describe the properties of the logs and the preprocessing steps .",
    "then , we provide a comprehensive analysis of the clauses and structure of the queries . finally , section  [ s : cfw ] summarizes our conclusions and future work .",
    ".dbpedia and swdf query log statistics . [ cols=\"^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to characterize whether pattern graphs have star shapes , we propose using a serialization of the out - degree of each node of the graph in decreasing order .",
    "star - shaped graphs will have a central node with a high out - degree , and several leaf nodes with null out - degree ( for instance : ` 3 0 0 0 ` ) .",
    "then we count the frequency of each degree pattern as shown in table  [ tab : outdegree ] .",
    "we see that the most common is the most simple one with one single triple , which might be considered a trivial star and chain .",
    "if we keep browsing the rest degree patterns , we observe that there is a big proportion of appearances ( more than the @xmath1 ) of almost - star - shaped graph structures between @xmath2 and @xmath3 nodes .",
    "we noticed that previous analysis of sparql queries were not deep enough to take scientifically - supported design decissions when devising rdf stores .",
    "hence , we carried out a study of real - world sparql queries in order to understand how real users construct them .",
    "we expect our results to be valuable to rdf store designers , specially in the tasks of query evaluation planification and index construction .",
    "we consider our study to be fairly representative , since we have analyzed a large rdf data set log such as dbpedia , and then we have contrasted those results with swdf .",
    "we conclude that most queries are simple , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4 of dbpedia queries and @xmath5 of swdf just contain a single triple pattern . however , there are many examples of queries including expensive sparql operations , like ` union ` , ` optional ` and joins . the percent of queries using join ranges from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ,",
    "and they are typically of the types ss(@xmath8 ) , so(@xmath9 ) and oo(@xmath10 ) .",
    "we also detected that most queries ( @xmath11 ) have a star - shaped graph pattern , and the chains in @xmath12 of the queries have length one , with the longest path having a length of five .",
    "in future works , we plan to extend our work to other query logs to assess which of our observed behaviours are generalizable , and which are more domain - dependent .",
    "we will also study how the different query clauses affect final solutions , paying special attention to performance .",
    "then , we will be able to provide helpful advices to practitioners on how to leverage our results to improve real - world systems .",
