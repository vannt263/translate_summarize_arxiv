    "scalar models in @xmath4 space - time dimensions with orthogonal symmetry are widely used in many areas of physics .",
    "some applications of these @xmath0 models are quantum dots , high - temperature superconductivity , low - dimensional systems , polymers , organic metals , biological molecular arrays , and chains . in this paper",
    ", we focus on a physical system consisting of interacting pions and @xmath1 mesons at nonzero temperature @xmath5 . for three spatial dimensions ,",
    "@xmath6 , an analytical solution to this model does not exist .",
    "thus , one has to use many - body approximation schemes in order to compute quantities of interest , such as the effective potential , the order parameter , and the masses of the particles as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "as an approximation scheme never gives the exact solution , it is of interest to compare different schemes and assess their physical relevance .",
    "for @xmath7 the @xmath0 symmetry group for the internal degrees of freedom is locally isomorphic to the chiral @xmath8 symmetry group of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with @xmath9 massless quark flavors .",
    "the phenomena of low - energy qcd are largely governed by chiral symmetry .    in the case of zero quark masses",
    "the qcd lagrangian is invariant under @xmath10 transformations , @xmath11 being the number of quark flavors .",
    "however , the true symmetry of qcd is only @xmath12 , because of the axial anomaly which explicitly breaks @xmath13 due nontrivial topological effects @xcite . for @xmath11 nonzero but degenerate quark masses , the @xmath14 symmetry is explicitly broken , such that qcd has only a @xmath15 flavor symmetry . in reality",
    ", different quark flavors have different masses , reducing the symmetry of qcd to @xmath16 , which corresponds to baryon number conservation . in the vacuum ,",
    "the axial @xmath14 symmetry is also spontaneously broken by a non - vanishing expectation value of the quark condensate @xmath17 @xcite . according to goldstone s theorem ,",
    "this leads to @xmath18 goldstone bosons .",
    "the chiral symmetry is restored at a temperature @xmath5 which for dimensional reasons is expected to be of the order of @xmath19 mev .",
    "this scenario is indeed confirmed by lattice simulations , in which ( for physical quark masses ) a crossover transition at @xmath20 mev has been observed @xcite .    for vanishing quark masses , the high- and the low - temperature phases of qcd have different symmetries , and therefore must be separated by a phase transition .",
    "the order of this chiral phase transition is determined by the global symmetry of the qcd lagrangian ; for @xmath21 , the transition is of first order if @xmath22 ; for @xmath12 the transition can be of second order if @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "if the quark masses are nonzero , the second - order phase transition becomes crossover .",
    "the calculation of hadronic properties at nonzero temperature faces serious technical difficulties . for a nonconvex effective potential standard perturbation theory",
    "can not be applied .",
    "furthermore , nonzero temperature introduces an additional scale which invalidates the usual power counting in terms of the coupling constant @xcite . a consistent calculation to a given order in the coupling constant",
    "then may require a resummation of whole classes of diagrams @xcite .    a convenient technique to perform such a resummation and",
    "thus arrive at a particular many - body approximation scheme is the so - called two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) or cornwall - jackiw - tomboulis ( cjt ) formalism @xcite , which is a relativistic generalization of the @xmath24-functional formalism @xcite .",
    "the cjt formalism extends the concept of the generating functional @xmath25   $ ] for one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) green s functions to that for 2pi green s functions @xmath26   $ ] , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the one- and two - point functions .",
    "the central quantity in this formalism is the sum of all 2pi vacuum diagrams , @xmath29   $ ] .",
    "any many - body approximation scheme can be derived as a particular truncation of @xmath30   $ ] .",
    "an advantage of the cjt formalism is that it avoids double counting and fulfills detailed balance relations and thus is thermodynamically consistent .",
    "another advantage is that the noether currents are conserved for an arbitrary truncation of @xmath31 , as long as the one- and two - point functions transform as rank-1 and rank-2 tensors .",
    "a disadvantage is that ward - takahashi identities for higher - order vertex functions are no longer fulfilled @xcite . as a consequence , goldstone s theorem",
    "is violated @xcite .",
    "a strategy to restore goldstone s theorem is to perform a so - called external  resummation of random - phase approximation diagrams with internal lines given by the full propagators of the approximation used in the cjt formalism @xcite .    in the literature",
    "different many - body approximations have been applied to examine the thermodynamical behavior of the @xmath0 model in its linear and nonlinear versions . in ref .",
    "@xcite optimized perturbation theory was used to compute the effective potential , spectral functions , and dilepton emission rates .",
    "the cjt formalism has been applied to study the thermodynamics of the @xmath0 model in the so - called double - bubble  approximation @xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite sunset - type diagrams have been included .",
    "the @xmath32 expansion has also been used several times to study various properties of the @xmath0 model at zero @xcite and nonzero @xcite temperature .    in this paper , we derive the effective potential for the @xmath0 linear @xmath1 model within the auxiliary - field method @xcite .",
    "the auxiliary field allows us to obtain the nonlinear version of the @xmath1 model by a well - defined limiting process from the linear version .",
    "we demonstrate that , to two - loop order , the effective potential is equivalent to the one of the standard @xmath0 linear @xmath1 model without auxiliary field , once the one- and two - point functions involving the auxiliary field are replaced by their stationary values .",
    "we then calculate the masses and the condensates of the @xmath0 model at nonzero @xmath5 in one - loop approximation .",
    "although we restrict our treatment to one - loop order , the condensate equation for the auxiliary field introduces self - consistently computed loops in the equations for the masses .",
    "therefore , the one - loop approximation with auxiliary field is qualitatively similar to the standard double - bubble ( hartree - fock ) approximation in the treatment without auxiliary field .",
    "however , since the equations for the masses differ quantitatively , they lead to different results for the order parameter and the masses of the particles as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the order of the chiral phase transition depends sensitively on the choice of renormalization scheme . in the linear version of the model and for",
    "explicitly broken chiral symmetry , it turns from crossover to first order as the mass of the @xmath1 particle increases . in the counter - term renormalization scheme",
    ", this transition happens for smaller values of the @xmath1 meson than in the case where vacuum contributions to tadpole diagrams are simply neglected ( the so - called trivial regularization ) . in the nonlinear case",
    "the phase transition is of first order . besides",
    ", in the region where the parameter space of the model allows for physical solutions of the mass equations , goldstone s theorem is always respected .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the linear and nonlinear versions of the model are presented and it is shown how they can be related with the help of an auxiliary field . in sec .",
    "iii the effective potential and the equations for the condensate and masses are derived .",

    "iv the results are presented for the linear and nonlinear versions of the model in the case of non - vanishing and vanishing explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "section v concludes this paper with a summary of our results and an outlook for further studies .",
    "an appendix contains an alternative proof of the equivalence of the treatment with and without auxiliary field , and details concerning the renormalization of tadpole integrals .",
