    "solitons in any physical medium are subject to attenuation due to dissipation , hence it is necessary to apply gain which can support the solitons . a possibility which may find interesting physical applications is to create a localized gain , which will be a trap for solitons in a lossy medium . in terms of optical solitons , this can be easily realized for spatial solitons in a planar waveguide , where the gain may be applied to a narrow strip .",
    "however , for spatial solitons gain is a redundancy , as they are supported simply by the energy flux through the soliton itself . besides that ,",
    "in this work it will be shown that , in the simplest case when the spatial solitons are governed by the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , a pinned soliton supported by the localized gain can never be stable .",
    "on the other hand , realization of the local - gain trap for usual temporal solitons is impossible , as such a soliton runs ( for instance , in an optical fiber @xcite ) with the group velocity of light .",
    "an unique possibility to create a gain - induced trap in a lossy medium is offered by a fiber grating , i.e. , a bragg grating ( bg ) written on an optical fiber .",
    "fiber gratings are a basis for many photonic devices @xcite .",
    "a challenging possibility is to use fiber gratings for the creation of pulses of slow light , which is a topic of great current interest @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the existence of slow pulses suggest to try a local - gain - induced trap for solitons .    in fiber gratings",
    ", solitons exist due to the interplay between the bragg reflection and kerr nonlinearity of the bg - carrying fiber @xcite .",
    "these solitons were predicted analytically @xcite , and then they were created in the experiment @xcite . except for the case",
    "in which the bg soliton is very broad @xcite , this species of optical solitons is distinct from the usual nonlinear - schrdinger ( nls ) solitons @xcite in ordinary nonlinear optical fibers .",
    "as it was mentioned above , search for very slow solitons in fiber gratings , which were predicted long ago @xcite , is an issue of great interest @xcite .",
    "the standard mathematical model of the nonlinear fiber grating predicts a whole family of zero - velocity solitons @xcite , a part of which is stable @xcite .",
    "if realized experimentally , such a soliton would represent a pulse of standing light , with its left- and right - traveling components being in a permanent dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the bg solitons which have been observed in the experiment up to date are moving ones , their velocity being @xmath2 of the maximum group velocity of light in the fiber @xcite .",
    "the quest for zero - velocity solitons may be facilitated by means of a local defect in the bg that exerts an attractive force on a soliton , having thus a potential to be a soliton trap ( note that a local defect may trap light in the fiber grating via the four - wave mixing without formation of a soliton @xcite ) . besides its profound physical importance @xcite , such a soliton trap is also promising for the fiber - sensing technology @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the soliton with an attractive defect in the form of a local suppression of bg was studied recently in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter work also considered a trap combining the local bg suppression and a change in the refractive index ( these two effects may come together as a manifestation of a local inhomogeneity in the bg - carrying fiber ) . as a result",
    ", it has been demonstrated that a gap soliton may indeed be pinned by the local defect , and , moreover , a narrow ( delta - functional ) defect uniquely selects parameters of the stable trapped soliton @xcite ( this feature is described in more detail below ) .    however , a trapped soliton will be destroyed by fiber loss .",
    "indeed , taking into regard that the best fiber gratings ( used as dispersion compensators in optical telecommunications @xcite ) have the attenuation rate @xmath3 db / cm ( in hybrid grating waveguides , using glass and a sol - gel material , the attenuation may be lowered to @xmath4 db / cm @xcite ) , it is easy to estimate that a standing soliton will be destroyed during the time @xmath5 ns",
    ". therefore , it is necessary to support the trapped soliton by means of a locally applied optical gain , which is tantamount to the above - mentioned soliton trap induced by local gain .",
    "a related problem is a possibility to capture a moving soliton by the local gain .",
    "these issues are the main subjects of the present work . besides the fundamental interest to having",
    "permanently maintained trapped optical solitons , they may also be interesting for applications , such as optical memory .",
    "the local gain can be provided , for instance , by a short resonantly doped segment in the bg - carrying fiber . in this connection",
    ", we note that the moving bg soliton that was observed for the first time in the fiber grating had the temporal width @xmath6 ps @xcite . taking into regard the lorentzian contraction ( as it was mentioned above , the soliton was moving at a velocity equal @xmath7 of the maximum group velocity ) , the same soliton ,",
    "if stopped , would have the spatial width on the order of a few centimeters .",
    "thus , the locally pumped segment of the fiber may be approximated by a delta - function ( which we assume in the analytical model below ) if , roughly speaking , its size is @xmath8 mm .",
    "note that the maximum gain that can be provided by an -doped amplifier is @xmath9 db / cm @xcite . comparing this to the above - mentioned minimum damping rate @xmath4 db / cm",
    ", we conclude that the proposed scheme may be self - consistent .",
    "thus , the model to be formulated below assumes the local gain in the form of the delta - function ( in the numerical part of the work , a smooth approximation to the delta - function is used ) .",
    "the model also includes an imaginary part of the localized gain , which actually accounts for a local perturbation of the fiber s refractive index ( note that the dopant , if used to induce the local gain , may indeed affect the local refractive index ) .",
    "the imaginary part is necessary , as it will be seen that pure gain can not maintain a pinned soliton in a stable state . as for the size of the refractive - index perturbation @xmath10",
    ", it will be seen that @xmath11 is definitely sufficient to stably trap a soliton . in this respect , it is relevant to mention that a dopant added to a silica fiber usually induces a refractive index change @xmath12 , while in a polymer fiber it is @xmath13 .",
    "the latter value can readily produce a stable pinned state of the soliton , and the former one may be sufficient too .",
    "a relatively large jump of the refractive index between the doped segment and the rest of the fiber may induce an additional effect , viz .",
    ", reflection of light , although the reflection may be smothered by a sufficiently smooth profile of distribution of the dopant . an additional term in the basic model [ see eqs .",
    "( [ o1 ] ) and ( [ o2 ] ) below ] , induced by the reflection , would be the same which formally accounts for a local perturbation of the bg reflectivity .",
    "the latter type of the conservative perturbation was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a conclusion being that its effect is quite similar to that directly produced by the refractive - index perturbation , which is directly included in eqs .",
    "( [ o1 ] ) and ( [ o2 ] ) . for this reason",
    ", we do not consider the local reflection as a separate perturbation in this work ( in any case , it can be easily added , if necessary ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the model , and produce some analytical results .",
    "first of all , we consider the stability of the zero solution against small perturbations in the presence of the uniform loss and localized loss",
    ". an instability - onset threshold is found , and it is demonstrated that the instability does not take place unless the gain has an imaginary part . for the comparison s sake , we also briefly consider an allied model problem , viz .",
    ", the instability induced by a `` hot spot '' in the lossy nls equation , which produces quite similar results .",
    "then , we produce a family of exact analytical solutions for solitons pinned by the local inhomogeneity of the refractive index , in the absence of loss and gain .",
    "another analytical result predicts what particular pinned soliton is selected by the balance of the loss and gain , provided that they are small perturbations .",
    "a soliton selected by the energy balance is also found in the lossy nls equation with the hot spot ( in that case , it is always unstable ) .",
    "section 3 reports results of direct simulations of pinned solitons , in both the conservative version of the model , and in the full one .",
    "a surprising result is that , in the conservative model , a _",
    "single _ pinned soliton , out of their continuous family , is stable .",
    "if the initially created soliton has larger energy , it relaxes , via emission of radiation , to the stable one , and if the energy of the initial soliton is smaller than that of the stable one , the pulse decays into radiation ; the former observation can be explained by known results for the stability of the ordinary solitons in the unperturbed bg model @xcite .",
    "a similar result is also obtained , in the framework of the conservative model , at the end of section 3 for a pair of repulsive defects : in the case when they can hold a soliton at the midpoint between them , any pulse either relaxes to a uniquely selected soliton , or decays ( if the pair of repulsive inhomogeneities can not hold a soliton , it splits the soliton in two ) .",
    "it is relevant to mention that a nonlinear bg structure with two local defects was very recently studied as a promising model for all - optical switching @xcite .    in the full model ,",
    "all the pinned solitons demonstrate persistent intrinsic vibrations ; depending on the ratio of the loss and gain , and on the strength of the attractive refractive - index inhomogeneity , the amplitude of the vibrations may be small or large . in the former case",
    ", the pinned soliton may be regarded as an approximately stationary one , then the above - mentioned analytical prediction of the soliton selected by the balance between the loss and gain gives an error between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which may be explained by extra radiation loss .    in section 4 , collision of a moving soliton with the hot spot",
    "is considered by means of direct simulations . as a result",
    ", regions of passage and capture are identified in the soliton s parameter space in both the conservative and full models .",
    "in fact , the capture is incomplete : a part of the soliton s energy gets trapped , giving rise to a pinned soliton , while the other part passes and rearranges itself into another soliton .",
    "if the inhomogeneity is strong , a conspicuous part of the energy may bounce back .",
    "a localized gain inserted into a fiber grating is modelled by a @xmath16  -  function term added to the standard bg model , which includes coupled equations for the amplitudes of the right- and left - travelling electromagnetic waves , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the full model is then    @xmath19    where the maximum group velocity of light is normalized to be @xmath20 , the nonlinear terms account for the self- and cross - phase modulation induced by the kerr effect , the linear couplings represent the mutual conversion of the waves due to the resonant bragg scattering ( the conversion coefficient is also normalized to be @xmath20 ) . on the right - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ o1 ] ) and ( [ o2 ] ) , the fiber loss parameter @xmath21 is real and positive , while the local - gain strength @xmath22 may be complex , @xmath23 its positive real part being the gain proper , while the imaginary part accounts for a localized perturbation of the refractive index ( note that @xmath24 corresponds to a local increase of the refractive index ) .",
    "we start the analysis with the linearized version of eqs .",
    "( [ o1 ] ) and ( [ o2 ] ) , in order to analyze the stability of the zero solution in the presence of the localized gain .",
    "an eigenmode of small perturbations is sough for as    @xmath28    where the frequency @xmath29 may be complex , its imaginary part being the instability growth rate , and @xmath30 must have a positive real part .",
    "substituting this into the linearized equations yields @xmath31 where the square root is defined so that its real part is positive , and @xmath32 a_{\\pm } $ ] .",
    "further , the integration of the linearized equations in an infinitesimal vicinity of @xmath33 yields @xmath34 .    eliminating the amplitudes @xmath35 and @xmath36 by means of these relations , we obtain an equation @xmath37 where the expression ( [ gamma ] ) was substituted for @xmath22 . finally , combining eqs .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) and ( [ kog ] ) , we can find the eigenfrequency sought for : @xmath38 where the sign multiplier in front of the second term provides for the fulfillment of the above - mentioned condition @xmath39 .    a straightforward consequence of eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) is an expression for the instability growth rate , @xmath40 thus , the localized gain gives rise to the instability of the trivial solution , provided that it is strong enough : @xmath41 note that the instability is _ impossible _ in the absence of the local refractive - index perturbation @xmath42 .",
    "the instability - onset condition ( [ critical ] ) simplifies in the limiting case when both the loss and gain parameters are small ( while @xmath42 is not necessarily small ) : @xmath43",
    "lastly , we notice that the instability is oscillatory : as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) , @xmath44 , unless @xmath45",
    ".    as the onset of instability in a system combining uniform loss and local gain is a simple but new issue , for the comparison s sake it is relevant to briefly consider it in a similar model , viz . , the nls equation : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the spatial - dispersion coefficient , @xmath21 and @xmath48 having the same meaning as above .",

    "@xmath139 of the soliton parameter @xmath26 , such that if @xmath140 , the soliton decays into radiation , as is seen in fig .",
    "solitons with @xmath141 relax into a stable one with @xmath142 , see fig .",
    "finally , a soliton with @xmath143 directly gives rise to the stable soliton , see fig .",
    "2(c ) .    the examples shown in fig .",
    "2 pertain to @xmath144 , and similar results were obtained for other values of @xmath42 .",
    "available computational power imposes a limitation on accuracy with which @xmath145 can be identified .",
    "however , it was found that , for @xmath146 , the decrease of the soliton s amplitude , which is defined as @xmath147 , is less than @xmath148 after the evolution time @xmath149 , if @xmath150 is taken from the interval @xmath151 , hence , in any case , @xmath152 belongs to the same interval . for a much larger value of the perturbation parameter , @xmath153 , the corresponding interval is @xmath154 , hence @xmath155 belongs to this region .",
    "generally , @xmath156 slightly increases with @xmath76 .    figure  3 summarizes these results in the form of a plot in the @xmath157 plane , which shows the regions where the initial soliton relaxes to the stable one or decays into radiation . in the region",
    "@xmath158 @xmath159 , where the initial configurations are not true stationary solutions , this configuration decays into radiation immediately .",
    "these results , obtained for the conservative model with the local inhomogeneity of the refractive index , are very similar to those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the stability of the solitons pinned by an attractive inhomogeneity in the form of a local suppression of the bragg grating .",
    "a noticeable common feature of the results is the existence of the _ single _ ( up to the numerical accuracy available ) value @xmath160 of the parameter",
    "@xmath26 which the established soliton may assume . in both conservative models ( the ones considered here and in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath150 relaxes to @xmath161 if @xmath141 , and the soliton decays into radiation if @xmath162 , i.e. , the soliton with @xmath142 may be called a _",
    "semi - attractor_. in fact , it strongly resembles _ semi - stable _ solitons , which are stable against small perturbations in the linear approximation , but may be unstable if terms quadratic in the perturbations are take into regard . semi - stable solitons were recently studied in another context , as the so - called embedded solitons , see ref . @xcite and references therein .    the fact that all the solitons with @xmath163 , where @xmath156 is slightly larger than @xmath164 , relax to the value @xmath142 , may be related to a known property of the ordinary solitons in the unperturbed bg model ( @xmath165 ) : they are unstable if @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "thus , at least in the case when @xmath42 is small , it is natural to expect that any pinned soliton with @xmath167 will relax , as a result of the instability , to a value close to @xmath168 .",
    "what is less obvious , is the decay of the solitons with @xmath169 , and the fact that @xmath156 so weakly depends on @xmath170 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .      in direct simulations of the full model , which includes the loss and local gain , the exact solution ( [ solution ] ) of the conservative version was again used as the starting point .",
    "the evolution of the solution was simulated at a fixed value of the loss parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the local gain @xmath87 was varied in order to determine its value(s ) at which the soliton settles down to a stable pinned soliton .",
    "figure 4 shows the evolution of the soliton s amplitude , defined as @xmath171 , vs. @xmath49 , when the localized gain @xmath87 is varied .",
    "the other parameters are fixed , so that @xmath172 for a small value of @xmath87 ( @xmath173 in fig .  4 ) , which is insufficient to balance the loss , the soliton decays . for a slightly larger @xmath174 , the soliton s amplitude grows , then it temporarily settles down ( at the value @xmath175 in fig .",
    "4 ) , and , eventually , regular oscillations set in . a long simulation , up to @xmath176 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) shows that the intrinsic vibrations of the soliton are completely stable .",
    "the waveforms @xmath177 and @xmath178 , obtained at the end of the simulation for @xmath174 , are shown in figure 5(a ) .",
    "when the gain @xmath87 is further increased , the initial growth of the soliton s amplitude is sharper ; however , it is found that it again temporarily settles down to a nearly constant value close to the same level of @xmath175 as above , which is followed by the onset of persistent oscillations .",
    "when @xmath87 is still larger , the eventual oscillatory state becomes chaotic with large fluctuations .",
    "the corresponding waveforms of @xmath179 and @xmath180 at the end of the simulation ( @xmath181 ) for @xmath182 are shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) . it can be seen that conspicuous radiation tails are attached to the soliton , which implies a permanent energy leakage from it .",
    "this extra loss adds up to the direct dissipative loss , both being compensated by the localized gain .",
    "if @xmath87 is too large , the radiation wave field outside the main pulse grows to such an extent that the resulting waveform can not be regarded as a localized one .",
    "in fact , in this case it is observed that the main pulse separates from the point @xmath33 , drifts away , and dies down due to the loss .",
    "however , the strong localized gain generates a new `` soliton '' around @xmath33 , which later drifts away again , this process repeating itself quasi - periodically .    an important feature of these results is that a stable ( even though it is vibrating ) soliton is possible not at a single value of the gain , that exactly compensates the loss , but in a finite interval of values of the gain . the energy balance is maintained , in this case , through permanent emission of radiation by the soliton , which compensates the excessive gain .",
    "it is relevant to mention that a very similar mechanism , which gives rise to stable _ nonequilibrium solitons _ in an overpumped system of a different type ( that , however , also originates in nonlinear optics  the so - called split - step model ) , was recently considered in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that case",
    "too , the stability of the soliton is provided by the emission of radiation that balances the excess gain .",
    "a further insight in sustained intrinsic vibrations of the pinned soliton , and the transition from the regular oscillations to dynamical chaos , is provided by consideration of the spectrum of the function @xmath183 . in the established oscillatory regime ,",
    "the spectrum was computed at several different values of @xmath87 , while the other parameters were kept constant as per eq .",
    "( [ fixed ] ) .",
    "figure 6(a ) shows the spectrum for @xmath174 , which is the value barely enough to compensate the loss .",
    "it can be seen that the established oscillations are quasi - harmonic , with a single well - pronounced frequency @xmath184 ( in arbitrary units ) , and an additional tiny spectral component at the frequency @xmath185 ( which is , apparently , incommensurate with the main one ) .",
    "figure 6(b ) shows the spectrum for @xmath186 , which is similar to that in fig .",
    "the main frequency shifts down to a value about @xmath187 , with two other visible components found at the frequencies @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "then , suddenly , at a slightly larger gain , @xmath190 , many new conspicuous spectral components emerge , which is shown in fig .",
    "6(c ) , and corresponds to ( apparently ) chaotic intrinsic vibrations of the established soliton .",
    "the same behavior is observed at @xmath191 . at @xmath192 ,",
    "the picture suffers another abrupt change [ see fig .",
    "6(d ) ] : the power spectrum reverts back to the simple three - frequency - component structure reminiscent of the situation at lower @xmath87 , cf .",
    "a transition from a chaotic behavior , ( presumably ) accounted for by a strange attractor , to a simple quasi - harmonic behavior is known in the theory of dynamical systems , where it is called a `` boundary crisis '' of the chaotic attractor @xcite .",
    "the picture revealed by the simulations changes the third time at @xmath193 , with reappearance of a many - component chaotic - like spectrum , similar to that in fig .",
    "the chaotic behavior continues to higher values of @xmath87 .",
    "figure  6(e ) shows the spectrum at @xmath194 , where its structure is not simply a multi - component one , but continuous , which is characteristic for well - developed dynamical chaos .",
    "another way to describe basic properties of the pinned solitons in the full model is to identify , for various initial values of @xmath150 , a minimum value @xmath195 of the gain which is necessary to overcome the loss .",
    "figure  7 shows the evolution of the soliton s amplitudes as a function of time for @xmath196 and @xmath197 , the corresponding minimum values being @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 , while the other parameters are fixed , @xmath201 and @xmath202 [ note that all these values of @xmath150 exceed @xmath42 , hence the corresponding exact solitons in the conservative model do exist , according to eq .",
    "( [ interval ] ) ] .",
    "thus , unlike the conservative model , in the full model , values of @xmath150 essentially smaller than @xmath164 may give rise to a stable pinned soliton ( with intrinsic vibrations ) .",
    "however , the smaller the difference @xmath203 , the larger value of @xmath87 is necessary , as , according to eqs .",
    "( [ de / dt ] ) and ( [ amplitude ] ) , the rate at which the localized gain supplies energy to the soliton decreases @xmath204 as @xmath205 .",
    "on the other hand , analysis of the simulation results shows that the characteristics of the established soliton do not depend on the initial value of @xmath150 which excited it , but solely on the values of @xmath21 and @xmath206 , i.e. , the established soliton is a genuine _",
    "attractor_.    then , effects caused by varying the loss parameter @xmath21 were investigated .",
    "because of the necessity to satisfy the energy balance condition , @xmath87 needs to be changed to track the variation of @xmath21 . for each value of @xmath21",
    ", we tried to find the minimum size of @xmath87 that supports a stable soliton .",
    "results of these numerical experiments , obtained for fixed @xmath202 and @xmath207 , and a set of values @xmath208and @xmath4 , are displayed in fig .",
    "the respective minimum - gain values were found to be @xmath209 , and @xmath210 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , except for the second case , when the ratio @xmath211 is @xmath212 , in all the other ones the ratio takes values between @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "it is clearly seen from fig . 8",
    "that the amplitude of the established soliton monotonically increases with the growth of @xmath21 ( which is accompanied by the growth of the minimum gain necessary to support the soliton ) .",
    "it is also seen that it was never possible to produce a truly stationary soliton , but in some cases ( @xmath215 and @xmath4 ) it was possible to generate nearly stationary solitons with a small amplitude of intrinsic vibrations .",
    "in other cases ( @xmath216 and @xmath217 ) , varying @xmath87 by steps as small as it was admitted by the numerical scheme , it was _ not _ possible to adjust the gain so that to suppress the internal vibrations , i.e. , the established soliton remained a breather , rather than anything close to a fixed - point state .",
    "in all the cases presented in fig . 8 , @xmath21 and @xmath87 are small enough to treat them as perturbations .",
    "then , if the established soliton assumes a nearly stationary form , it is natural to expect that it must be close to the solution ( [ solution ] ) found in the conservative model , with some value of @xmath26 , and this @xmath26 must be related to @xmath21 and @xmath87 as per eq .",
    "( [ complicated ] ) .",
    "it was checked that the quasi - stationary solitons , in those cases in when they were found , are indeed close to the wave form ( [ solution ] ) .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath26 were identified by means of the least - squared - error fit to the expression  ( [ solution ] ) .",
    "then , for thus found values of @xmath26 and given values of @xmath21 , the equilibrium values of the gain @xmath87 were calculated as predicted by the analytical formula ( [ complicated ] ) .",
    "results of this are presented in table 1 .",
    "a noticeable fact obvious from table 1 is that , in all the cases , the numerically found equilibrium value of the gain exceeds the analytically predicted one by @xmath218 to @xmath219 per cent . because in all the cases , as it was stressed above , the established solitons are not completely stationary , a natural conjecture is that the slightly vibrating soliton continuously emits energy at a low rate , and this extra energy loss makes it necessary to have the gain somewhat larger than that which compensates the direct dissipative loss as per eq .",
    "( [ complicated ] ) .",
    "as concerns the comparison of the full model with its conservative counterpart , we recall that , in the conservative model , the stable pinned soliton always assumes a single value of @xmath26 for given @xmath42 ( and this value very weakly depends on @xmath42 , always being slightly larger than @xmath164 , see fig .",
    "3 ) . on the contrary to this ,",
    "in the full model the quasi - stationary soliton may be stable in a range of the values of @xmath26 , as it is evident from table 1 .",
    "finally , it has also been checked whether stable pinned solitons can be found when the `` hot point '' does not perturb the refractive index , i.e. , @xmath65 . as a result",
    ", it has been concluded that any finite positive @xmath42 ( the smallest value tried was @xmath220 ) may support a stable soliton in the pinned state , but if @xmath65 , the pulse set at @xmath33 finally drifts away , and then decays due to the loss . an explanation to this finding",
    "may be that all the solitons found in the model with loss and gain emit some radiation , see above , and asymmetric fluctuations in the emission rate create a weak random force that drives the soliton away .",
    "the soliton may be stably pinned not only by an attractive inhomogeneity , but also between two separated repulsive ones ( in the present context , each one will represent a locally suppressed refractive index , corresponding to @xmath79 ) .",
    "the consideration of this configuration is interesting by itself , and it also may be used to design a soliton - based optical oscillator , in which the eigenfrequency is easily controlled by the choice of the separation between the two repulsive points . in particular , in the framework of the perturbation theory ( for small @xmath221 ) , the soliton may be regarded as a quasiparticle in the external potential @xmath222 where the potential @xmath223 is given by eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) ( with @xmath224 ) , and @xmath225 is the separation between the two defects .",
    "we simulated the dynamics of this configuration in some detail , but only for the conservative case , @xmath61 .",
    "first of all , if @xmath225 is smaller than the proper size of the soliton , it sees the pair of the inhomogeneities , in the first approximation , as a single repulsive center , hence stable bound states are not possible . within the framework of the perturbation theory , eqs .",
    "( [ w2 ] ) and ( [ w ] ) make it possible to predict a critical value , @xmath226 , at which a stable equilibrium appears for the first time at @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding expression is cumbersome , but it easy to verify that @xmath227 monotonically decreases , with @xmath26 varying from @xmath228 to @xmath164 , from @xmath229 to the minimum value @xmath230 .",
    "direct simulations at finite @xmath42 demonstrate [ see an example in fig .",
    "9 ] that , in the case of relatively small @xmath225 , when the pinned state of the soliton is unstable , the dynamical evolution does not trivially reduce to pushing the soliton aside ; instead , a generic outcome is _ splitting _ of the soliton in two , which is accompanied by a spontaneous symmetry breaking ( in some cases , for instance if @xmath231 , the other parameters being the same as in fig . 9",
    ", the instability develops so slowly that it was not possible to identify the outcome ) .    with the increase of @xmath225 ,",
    "stabilization of the soliton trapped between the repulsive inhomogeneities becomes possible .",
    "the trapped states seem most stable around the value @xmath232 , see an example in fig . 10 . in this case , systematic simulations reveal a feature which strongly resembles the one reported above for the single attractive inhomogeneity in the conservative model : an established trapped state is stable for a single ( up to the accuracy of numerical simulations ) value of @xmath26 , which is very close to @xmath164 ; if @xmath233 , the soliton sheds off some radiation and eventually relaxes to the said single value of @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "10 ) , while if @xmath234 , the soliton gradually decays into radiation .",
    "thus , the single - valuedness of the stable soliton in the conservative model appears to be a generic property . for still larger values of @xmath225 ,",
    "the pinned state is less robust ; in particular , a soliton with @xmath235 may split , instead of relaxing to the stable one with @xmath236 .",
    "once the existence of stable pinned soliton has been established , the next natural step is to consider a possibility of capturing a free moving soliton by the `` hot spot '' . to this end",
    ", the soliton was first generated far from the spot by means of the newton - raphson method , as a stationary solution in the reference frame moving at some velocity @xmath237 ; a range of the velocities @xmath238 was thus investigated .",
    "then , the collision was considered , running direct simulations of eqs .",
    "( [ o1 ] ) and ( [ o2 ] ) .",
    "first , the collision experiment was performed in the conservative model , with @xmath239 .",
    "the parameter plane @xmath240 was explored with @xmath237 taking values @xmath241 , and @xmath42 taking values @xmath242 , while @xmath150 was kept constant at @xmath243 .",
    "if the inhomogeneity is weak , the moving soliton passes through it , see an example in fig .",
    "when the inhomogeneity strength is larger , @xmath244 , a part of the soliton still passes through it , but another part of the soliton s energy is captured by the local defect to form a pinned soliton , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "some radiation bouncing in the backward direction can also be observed when @xmath42 is large , or when the incident soliton is fast .",
    "naturally , more energy is trapped by the defect if @xmath42 is larger [ fig .",
    "11(c ) ] , and less energy is trapped if the soliton is faster .",
    "however , the value @xmath245 , at which the trapping begins , only weakly depends on the soliton s velocity @xmath237 .",
    "figure  12 summarizes these results , showing a border in the @xmath240 plane between the passage and partial - capture regions .",
    "next , we consider the collisions in the full model , with @xmath201 and @xmath87 @xmath246 .",
    "results reported in the previous section show that a stable pinned soliton exists at these values of the loss and gain ( the collisions were simulated only for small values of @xmath21 , as otherwise the soliton will be strongly attenuated still before the collision ) .",
    "the initial value of the soliton s parameter was again @xmath247 .",
    "the results obtained for the full model are not very different from those for the conservative one .",
    "when the gain @xmath42 is small , the soliton passes through , and if @xmath42 is larger , a part of the energy is trapped to form a pinned soliton .",
    "a difference from the conservative model is that the value of @xmath42 at which the inhomogeneity starts to capture a part of the soliton s energy in the conservative model is approximately independent of its velocity : @xmath248 if @xmath249 , while in the lossy model , this value of @xmath42 increases with @xmath237 , as is seen in fig .",
    "another representative set of numerical data can be displayed for a fixed value of the soliton s velocity , @xmath250 , while the parameter @xmath251 of the incident soliton takes values @xmath252 , and @xmath253 .",
    "these results are presented here only for the conservative model .",
    "simulations show that , if the moving soliton is heavy ( large @xmath251 ) or the inhomogeneity is weak , the soliton passes it .",
    "heavier solitons can pass through a stronger defect .",
    "if the inhomogeneity is strong ( @xmath42 is large ) , the soliton gets trapped , which is always accompanied by emission of radiation in both the forward and backward directions , and the radiation can further self - trap into secondary solitons . at small @xmath42",
    ", little energy is scattered away in either direction . if @xmath42 is larger , more energy is scattered forward , and when @xmath42 is still larger ( @xmath254 ) , more energy is scattered backwards , cf .",
    "figure 13 summarizes the results obtained for the interaction of the moving soliton and the localized attractive defect in the conservative model for the fixed velocity , @xmath250    it is natural to compare the results obtained for the conservative model with those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the interaction of the moving gap soliton with an attractive inhomogeneity in the form of a local suppression of the bragg grating . in that case ,",
    "when the soliton was heavy ( large @xmath26 ) , the interaction effectively reverted from attraction to repulsion , so that the incident soliton could bounce back . in the present model ,",
    "this unusual behavior has never been observed .",
    "in this work , we have introduced a model of a lossy nonlinear fiber grating with a `` hot spot '' combining the localized gain and attractive inhomogeneity of the refractive index ; the spot can be created by means of doping a short segment of the fiber . in the absence of the loss and gain ,",
    "a family of exact solutions for pinned solitons was found . in the full model including loss and gain , the instability threshold for the zero solution was found ; it was concluded that the instability is not possible without the presence of the imaginary part of the local gain , i.e. , a localized perturbation of the refractive index .",
    "further , for small values of the loss and gain , it was predicted what soliton is selected by the energy - balance condition .",
    "parallel to this , it was shown that , in the simpler model based on the nls equation , the pinned soliton can never be stable in the presence of the loss and local gain .    in direct simulations , we have found  that a single pinned soliton is stable in the conservative fiber - grating model .",
    "it is a semi - attractor : solitons with a larger energy relax to it via emission of radiation , while the ones with smaller energy completely decay into radiation .",
    "the same conclusion is obtained for solitons trapped between two repulsive inhomogeneities . in the full model with the loss and gain ,",
    "all the stable pinned pulses demonstrate persistent internal vibrations and emission of radiation .",
    "sometimes , they are almost stationary solitons , and in these cases the prediction based on the energy balance underestimates the necessary gain by @xmath255 to @xmath256 , which is explained by the extra radiation loss . if the loss and gain increase , the intrinsic vibrations become chaotic .",
    "collisions of free moving solitons with the `` hot spot '' were simulated too .",
    "the passage and capture regimes were identified for the solitons in the conservative and full models ; the capture is only partial , which actually implies splitting of the soliton .",
    "if was also found that , if a large part of the soliton s energy is radiated away , it may self - trap into secondary solitons .",
