    "the mass and internal structure of galaxy clusters reflect the properties of primordial density perturbations and the nature of dark matter .",
    "a most striking prediction from numerical simulations based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model of structure formation is that dark matter halos can be described by a universal mass density profile as found by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw ; also see moore et al .",
    "1999 ; fukushige & makino 2001 ; most recently navarro et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "these results have shown that cluster - scale halos should have relatively shallow , low - concentration mass profiles , where the power - law slope of density profile becomes more negative with increasing radius , approaching an asymptotic slope of @xmath29 around the virial radius .",
    "the dark matter halo mass function , of which galaxy clusters represent the high mass tail , is also sensitive to cosmological parameters , including for example the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath30 ( e.g.  white et al .",
    "1993 ; kitayama & suto 1997 ; haiman et al .",
    "2001 ; vikhlinin et al .  2008 ) .",
    "testing predictions from numerical dark matter simulations and probing dark energy require precise measurements of galaxy cluster masses , however it is non - trivial to define what is meant by the mass of a cluster because clusters do not have any clear boundary between themselves and the surrounding large - scale structure . by convention cluster mass",
    "is therefore defined as the mass enclosed within a three - dimensional sphere of a given radius with respect to the halo center such as the virial mass ( e.g. , white 2002 ) . given a working definition of mass , a method of mass measurement must be chosen , each of which suffers a number of advantages and disadvantages , as discussed below .",
    "the deep potential well of a galaxy cluster causes weak shape distortions of background galaxy images due to differential deflection of light rays , resulting in a coherent distortion pattern around the cluster center , known as weak gravitational lensing ( narayan & bartelmann 1996 ; bartelmann & schneider 2001 ; schneider 2006 ) .",
    "measuring this coherent distortion pattern allows us to map directly the mass distribution in a cluster without requiring any assumptions on the dynamical / physical state of the system ( e.g. , kaiser & squires 1993 ; fahlman et al .",
    "other methods rest on some assumptions : the velocity dispersion of member galaxies invoke assumptions on the velocity anisotropies , dynamical equilibrium of the cluster , and the geometry of the system .",
    "methods based on observations of @xmath0-ray and the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect usually rest on assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry .",
    "however , lensing - based methods also suffer several limitations .",
    "first , lensing observables are sensitive to the total mass distribution projected along the line of sight from an observer to source galaxies .",
    "therefore mass concentrations along the line of sight through a given cluster , which are not physically associated with the cluster , increase the uncertainty on cluster mass measurements from the lensing observables ( metzler et al .",
    "2000 ; white et al . 2001",
    "; hoekstra 2001 ; hamana et al .",
    "second , exhaustive spectroscopic redshift information is not available for cluster lensing observations . the limited information on source galaxy redshifts derived from the available broad - band photometry results in degeneracies between cluster parameters and the estimated source galaxy redshifts .",
    "furthermore , in practice it is not straightforward to isolate background , therefore lensed , galaxies based on the photometric data alone . in fact including unlensed galaxies ( mostly cluster members for low-@xmath31 clusters of interest ) into the lensing analysis appears to cause a significant dilution of the lensing distortion signals , thereby yielding biased estimations on cluster parameters ( e.g. , broadhurst et al . 2005 ; medezinski et al .",

    "; hoekstra 2007 ; umetsu & broadhurst 2008 ) .",
    "recently a possible tension between the cdm model predictions and the lensing observations has been reported : anomalously high concentration parameter estimates have been obtained for a1689 , cl0024 and ms2137 ( gavazzi et al .",

    "2003 ; broadhurst et al.2005 ; broadhurst et al .  2008 ;",
    "oguri et al .",
    "however , before a serious problem with cdm may be claimed , it is important ( among other things ) to address carefully the selection bias inherent in studying strong lensing clusters .",
    "specifically , strong lensing clusters are likely biased towards clusters with high concentrations and/or significantly non - spherical mass distribution ( e.g. , oguri et al.2005 ; hennawi et al .  2007 ;",
    "corless et al .",
    "a systematic weak lensing study of a large cluster sample is therefore an essential step towards resolving , or confirming , this tension .",
    "an important aspect of such a study is to minimize possible selection biases towards clusters with simpler ( presumably `` relaxed '' ) or more complex ( presumably `` unrelaxed '' ) gravitational potentials .",
    "a selection function that is blind to such factors would support increased understanding of possible biases in cluster mass estimates as a function of the dynamical state and shape of clusters ( dahle et al.2002 ; smith et al .",

    "2006 ; bardeau et al .",
    "2007 ; hoekstra 2007 ; okabe & umetsu 2008 ) .",
    "such a systematic weak lensing study would also be invaluable as the foundation for a careful comparison of lensing - based mass estimates with those from other methods , en route to measuring precisely the shape , scatter and normalization of mass - observable scaling relations and to calibrating the systematic errors inherent in each mass measurement method ( smith et al .",

    "these clusters are a sub - set of those studied by the local cluster substructure survey ( locuss ) project ( pi : g.  p.  smith ; also see smith et al .  in preparation ) , and have therefore been selected in a manner blind to the dynamical status and cluster morphology  see  [ sec : locuss ] for more details . the superb image quality , wide field capability , and 8-m aperture of subaru / suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) allow us to investigate in detail the accuracy achievable on cluster mass measurements with ground - based weak lensing data .",
    "it is also important to note that the redshift range of the clusters in this study is well - matched to the field - of - view of suprime - cam ( about one - quarter square degrees )  one pointing spans the entire virialized region of each cluster ( cluster - centric radii of @xmath32 ) , which is essential to achieve robust constraints on cluster virial masses .",
    "we explore different methods of cluster mass estimation , specifically , fitting of several different parametric mass profiles and the model - independent lensing aperture mass method .",

    "the locuss selection function is deliberately blind to the physical properties of clusters , other than the requirement to be bright enough in the x - ray band to lie above the rass flux limit . the sample is therefore expected to span a broad range of dynamical stages of cluster evolution , including extreme merger and extreme `` relaxed '' systems .",
    "one of the main goals of the survey is to calibrate mass - observable scaling relations , and to identify the main astrophysical systematic uncertainties in the use of these relations for cluster cosmology , in a similar vein to smith et al.s ( 2003 ) preliminary results on @xmath39 .",
    "the subaru data presented in this paper form the backbone of the scaling relation aspects of the survey .",
    "more generally , studies of the locuss sample are in progress combining data from a wide range of ground - based ( gemini , keck , vlt , subaru , sza , palomar , mmt , noao and ukirt ) and space - based ( hst , galex , spitzer , chandra and xmm - newton ) facilities .    the subaru prime focus camera , suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .  2002 ) , has the widest field - of - view ( fov ) ( @xmath40 ) among 8-m class telescopes , and can cover the entire region of a cluster at low redshift @xmath41 ( up to a few mpc in radius ) with one pointing . the large telescope aperture , wide fov , and superb image quality of subaru / suprime - cam therefore mean this is a uniquely powerful facility for an efficient ground - based weak - lensing study of a large sample of low redshift galaxy clusters .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : c - m ]    we quantify the possible trend by fitting the following function to the @xmath8-@xmath56 data points : @xmath57 this form is motivated by the simulation based studies ( e.g.  bullock et al 2001 ) and specified by two free parameters : normalization @xmath58 and mass slope @xmath59 .",

    "we randomly draw @xmath56 and @xmath8 for each cluster from the respective posterior distributions , and re - calculate the best - fit @xmath9-@xmath8 30000 times . from the mean relation derived from these samples , and the scatter around the mean",
    ", we estimate that the significance of our detection of anti - correlation between mass and concentration is unchanged , and conclude that the intrinsic correlation has a negligible effect on our results .",
    "we also checked whether the parameter fitting above causes a bias in the best - fit slope @xmath59 of the scaling relation @xmath62 by using simulated data .",
    "first , we generated 3000 simulated catalogs of the tangential shear profiles for 19 clusters including the errors at each radial bins that are modeled to reproduce the measured errors . in making this simulations the mass and concentration of each cluster are randomly chosen from the observed ranges of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the redshift of all clusters is fixed to a single redshift @xmath65 corresponding to the mean redshift of the 19 subaru clusters .",
    "note that the simulated cluster catalogs have no intrinsic scaling relation between @xmath8 and @xmath56 on average , i.e. @xmath66",
    ". then we estimated @xmath56 and @xmath8 parameters for each simulated cluster from the shear profile fitting to an nfw model , and made a fitting of the distribution of @xmath56 and @xmath8 for 19 clusters to the model @xmath8-@xmath9 relation ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : c - m ] ] ) . from the 3000 catalogs we found that the estimated slope of @xmath67 tends to be slightly biased as @xmath68 from the input value @xmath66 .",
    "the origin of this bias can again be ascribed to the degeneracy between mass and concentration for the shear profile fitting .",
    "nevertheless the amount of the bias is smaller than the @xmath55 statistical errors of @xmath59 estimation , @xmath69 , therefore we conclude that this effect is also insignificant .    the observed concentration - mass relation can be compared with the theoretical predictions based on large @xmath70-body simulations .",

    "the observed concentrations of @xmath74 clusters , i.e.  @xmath75 are consistent with the prediction , however the observed slope is steeper than the prediction , albeit at very modest statistical significance .",
    "it is also important to note that the clusters ( star symbols ) that are well fitted by an nfw profile have low concentrations of @xmath76 , while the distribution of clusters ( squares ) for which we can not discriminate between cis and nfw models extends to much large concentrations .",
    "the region enclosed by the two dashed lines shows the range of @xmath77 in which simulated clusters are typically distributed as shown in duffy08 ( also see jing 2000 ) .",

    "the observed statistical errors are so large that it s not possible to say whether there is any intrinsic scatter contribution .",

    "note that the @xmath0-ray results are derived using a much wider range of halo masses than our results  from galaxy to galaxy cluster scales .",

    "the lensing results indicate a steeper dependence than the @xmath0-ray results , but the discrepancy is not yet conclusive due to the large statistical errors .",
    "a further , careful study will be needed to resolve these possible discrepancies .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f7.ps    in figure  [ fig : cvir_hist ] we show the one - dimensional distribution of the concentration parameters for the 19 clusters in figure  [ fig : c - m ] .",
    "the mean values and error bars in each bin are computed from 3000 monte carlo redistributions of the clusters , assuming that the halo concentration of each cluster obeys the gaussian distribution with width given by the measurement error @xmath80 .",
    "note that the data points in different bins are correlated .",
    "interestingly the observed distribution contains a dip at @xmath81 , suggesting that a single log - normal model distribution may not fit the distribution very well .",
    "the solid and dashed curves show the results of fitting one and two log - normal distributions , respectively . given the large error bars ,",
    "the two models both give an acceptable fit to the data : the two log - normal distributions ( additional two model parameters compared to the one lognormal distribution ) improve the @xmath82 value only by @xmath83 .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to note that simulations have found similar structure in the distribution of predicted concentrations ( jing 2000 ; shaw et al .",
    "2006 ; neto et al.2007 ; duffy08 ) .",
    "it is argued in these studies that the physical origin of the structure lies in the dynamical status of clusters : more relaxed clusters tend to have high concentrations and vice versa ( also see smith & taylor 2008 )",
    ". it will therefore be important to explore further the concentration distribution by enlarging the sample size of clusters .",
    "( 170mm,170mm)f8.ps    in this section we study the stacked weak - lensing signal of 19 clusters in figure  [ fig : c - m ] .",
    "this approach has several important advantages .",
    "first , the _ average _ distortion profile is less sensitive to substructures within and asphericity of the individual cluster mass distributions and also to uncorrelated large - scale structure along the same line - of - sight .",
    "this is because these `` contaminating signals '' are averaged out via the stacking , under the assumption that the universe is _ statistically _ homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "second , stacking should boost the signal - to - noise ratio of the distortion signal at very small and large radii .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio at small radii is limited for a single cluster because the solid angle subtended by a radial bin shrinks at small radii thus reducing the number of galaxies over which the mean distortion signal is calculated .",
    "hence the signal - to - noise ratio suffers despite the signal peaking in these regions . on the other hand , at large radii",
    ", the binned solid - angle is much larger , helping to maintain signal - to - noise , however the signal becomes very small , and thus the signal - to - noise ratio declines .",
    "as discussed in   5.3 ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is optimized at intermediate radii . therefore",
    ", stacking helps to improve signal - to - noise as a function of radius , thus enabling a clearer investigation of ( i ) the curvature of the density profile that is a characteristic signature of the nfw prediction , helping us potentially to address the nature of dark matter ( e.g.  yoshida et al .",
    "2000 ) , and ( ii ) the distribution of mass outside the virial radius to address whether or not the outer slope of the nfw profile , @xmath84 , continues outside the virial radius ( e.g.  bertschinger 1985 ; busha et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "to study the stacked lensing signal , we divide the 19 clusters into two mass bins , based on whether the nfw model fits to individual clusters yielded a virial mass estimate of greater than or less than @xmath85 .",
    "this results in two sub - samples of 10 low - mass and 9 high - mass clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : stack ] shows the average distortion profile as a function of the projected radius in the physical length scale .",
    "note that the effect of different cluster redshifts was taken into account by using the weighting method in terms of the lensing efficiency functions of averaging clusters ( mandelbaum et al .",
    "2006 ; also see sheldon et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the projected radius is computed from the weighted mean redshift of the sampled clusters . however , we checked that , even if we use the single lensing efficiency for the mean cluster redshift , the results are almost unchanged due to the narrow redshift coverage of our cluster samples .",
    "note that the mean lens redshifts are @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the low- and high - mass samples , respectively .",
    "first , unsurprisingly , the stacked profiles yield _ very _ significant detections : the total signal - to - noise ratios are @xmath88 and @xmath89 for the low- and high - mass samples respectively .",
    "second , the lensing distortion signals are recovered over a wide range of radii , from @xmath90kpc to 3@xmath91mpc scales , spanning a factor of 50 in radius .",
    "note that the outer radial boundary corresponds to the size of the suprime - cam s fov for clusters at @xmath92 , and is a factor @xmath93 beyond the cluster virial radii determined from the individual nfw model fits .",
    "visual inspection of the stacked profiles also reveals that they are clearly not described by a single power law model , displaying very obvious curvature , reminiscent of the nfw prediction .",
    "we therefore fitted sis and nfw models to the stacked profiles , and show as solid and dashed curves are the best - fit nfw and sis models respectively .",
    "the non - linear corrections in the measured reduced shear are taken into account in these fits following the method in mandelbaum et al.(2006 ) , however for simplicity we ignore uncertainties in the alignment of cluster halo centers ; we will discuss this effect in detail in   [ sec : center ] .",
    "now very clearly the sis model is strongly disfavored at @xmath4 and @xmath5 significance for the low- and high - mass samples , respectively , estimated from the difference between the @xmath82 values of the best - fit nfw and sis models : @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the nfw model gives an acceptable fit to the data ( the cis model is also acceptable ) .",
    "the best - fit nfw parameters are @xmath96 , @xmath97 for the low - mass sample , and @xmath98 , @xmath99 for the high - mass sample , i.e.  relative accuracies of about @xmath100 for both @xmath8 and @xmath56 , an improvement by factor of 2 - 5 compared to the individual cluster constraints in figure  [ fig : dm_to_m ] . comparing the two mass bins",
    "reveals that the concentration parameter appears to be greater for the low - mass sample than for the high - mass one at @xmath101 significance .",
    "it is re - assuring that this difference is exactly consistent with the relation found from the individual cluster analysis of 19 clusters in figure  [ fig : c - m ] , even though the individual - cluster and stacked analyses involve non - trivial differences in the averaging procedures that are not necessarily equivalent for real clusters ( e.g.  due to non - spherical mass distribution and substructures ) .",
    "the measured distortion profile outside the virial radius is consistent with the outer slope of nfw profile , i.e.  we could not find any evidence that the mass distribution outside the virial radius , which mostly contains gravitationally unbound mass , declines more rapidly than is predicted by nfw .",
    "this is in contrast to the sharply truncated profile at the virial radius discussed by busha et al .",
    "( 2005 ; see also takada & jain 2004 ; prada et al .",
    "2006 ; baltz et al .",
    "the stacked distortion profiles also do not show any signature of associated large - scale structures such as filamentary structures surrounding the clusters , unlike the sdss stacked lensing results ( johnston et al .",
    "however the large - scale structure lensing signals are only expected to dominate at projected radii greater than @xmath102mpc .",
    "hence , by further extending the observed fields to obtain more radial range covered , it would be interesting to explore the lensing signals outside the virial radius to test the cdm structure formation scenarios sitting more in the linear regime .",
    "finally , we note that the results presented in this section help to explain the systematic difference between virial mass estimates between sis and nfw model fits to the individual clusters as found in fig .",
    "[ fig : msis_vs_mnfw ] .",
    "the virial mass estimates are dominated by the integral of the density profile on large radii around the virial radius .",

    "one of the most important systematic errors to which we have paid particular attention is the dilution of the weak - lensing signal due to contamination of background galaxy catalog by faint cluster galaxies .    as described in ",
    "[ sec : sample ] , we defined several samples of background galaxies according to different color / magnitude selection criteria : the magnitude - selected faint galaxy sample that is often used in the literature and a more secure `` red+blue '' galaxy sample , defined as faint galaxies redder and bluer than the cluster red - sequence by a minimum color offset .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare_c+m ] demonstrates the impact of dilution on estimates of the cluster parameters , comparing the best - fit nfw parameters obtained when using the faint and red+blue galaxy samples .",
    "it is clear that the concentration parameter for the faint galaxy sample is systematically smaller than for the red+blue sample for most of the clusters , i.e.underestimated due to the dilution effect inherent in the faint sample .",
    "the bias is measured to be @xmath265 . on the other hand ,",
    "the virial mass constraints are consistent between the two samples within the error bars : @xmath266 .",
    "this is because the virial mass is mainly sensitive to the overall shear amplitudes at large radii ( @xmath267 ) , and relatively insensitive to the distortion signals at small radii to which the concentration parameter is particularly sensitive .",
    "it is important to remember here that the dilution effect increases as cluster - centric distance decreases because the number density of faint cluster galaxies that contaminate the faint galaxy catalog is expected to roughly follow the underlying density profile of the cluster .",
    "thus our results indicate that correcting for the dilution effect is important to obtain unbiased , accurate constraints on cluster parameters , especially on the concentration parameter .",
    "it is nevertheless worth noting that , due to the limited information on galaxy colors and redshifts , the red+blue galaxy sample we have used may still be contaminated by member and foreground galaxies . according to the results in figure  [ fig : compare_c+m ] ,",
    "we should also bear in mind that the virial mass estimates are relatively unbiased , but the best - fit concentration parameters given in table  [ tab : massprofile ] may still underestimate the true value ( if an nfw profile represents the true mass distribution ) .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f11.ps",
    "however , unsurprisingly given the expected variation of dilution as a function of radius , the amplitude of the bias in mass measurements depends on the chosen aperture radius within which mass is measured . figure  [ fig : mall_to_mredblue ] shows the variation of the ratio of mass estimates from the faint and red+blue galaxy samples change as a function of the over - density used to define the cluster mass .",
    "as @xmath268 increases the cluster masses become progressively underestimated due to more significant dilution of the weak - lensing signal by cluster members .",
    "this is an important result when considering studies in which lensing - based mass estimates are compared with cluster observables at other wavelengths that are conventionally measured at over - densities exceeding @xmath24 .",
    "for example , @xmath0-ray observations , especially with _ chandra _ , are typically sensitive out to @xmath249 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mall_to_mredblue ] shows that , in this case , weak lensing may underestimate @xmath251 by a factor of 2 if the faint galaxy sample , based solely on the magnitude selection , is employed .",
    "therefore , the dilution effect should be carefully corrected for if weak lensing is used to estimate cluster masses with higher over - densities .      as described in   [ ssec : zs ] , we estimated redshifts of source galaxies using the well - calibrated cosmos photo-@xmath31 catalog .",
    "however , our analysis includes faint galaxies sometimes down to @xmath269 , while the cosmos galaxies are available only down to @xmath270 .",
    "hence our lensing results may be affected by a residual uncertainty in the source redshift , although such faint galaxies are generally assigned a smaller weight . a @xmath271 or @xmath100 change in the average distance ratio , which controls the overall amplitude of distortion signal , corresponds to @xmath272 or @xmath273 in the mean source redshift for a cluster at @xmath274 or 0.3 , respectively .",
    "a typical uncertainty in the mean source redshift , inferred from the photo-@xmath31 errors in the cosmos catalog , is a few @xmath275 at most , therefore a 10% level change in the mean redshift is unlikely .",
    "recall that a bias in the average distance ratio is linearly propagated into a bias in cluster mass estimates ( a 10@xmath275 change in @xmath276 yields a @xmath100 change in the best - fit mass parameter ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the concentration parameter is less affected by the bias in the distance ratio about by a factor of 2 , because the concentration is constrained by the shape of distortion profile .",

    "such a misalignment may cause a bias in measuring the tangential distortion profile and thus cluster model parameters .",
    "one advantage of our weak lensing analysis is we can measure variations in the goodness - of - fit of the nfw model fitting to the distortion profile by varying the cluster center , on an individual cluster basis ; this can be contrasted to the the stacked cluster - galaxy lensing where the cluster center of each cluster has to be _ a priori _ assumed before stacking ( johnston et al .",

    "more precisely , the results are computed from the variance of the best - fit parameters obtained from 100 monte carlo realizations of random cluster center identifications .",
    "the range of 10@xmath277 radius is based on the fact that the @xmath82 value for the best - fit model significantly degrades for most of our clusters if the cluster center is taken to be offset from the bcg position by more than @xmath278 , and is also consistent with the distribution of offsets between bcg centres and x - ray centroids ( sanderson et al .",

    "our fiducial analysis did not use the distortion signals at very small radii to avoid the effect of noisy measurements in bins that subtend small solid angles on the sky , in addition to seeking to minimize the impact of any mis - identification of the cluster center on the model fitting ( see the tangential distortion plots for each cluster field in appendix  [ sec : massmap ] to find the range of angular scales used ) .",
    "the square symbols in figure  12 show the mean variation in the nfw parameters obtained when shifting the innermost radial bin used in the analysis by @xmath279 with the cluster center being fixed to the bcg position .",
    "this uncertainty has a similar - level impact on the model parameters to the diamonds , and is again considered as an insignificant effect compared to the current statistical precision .",
    "finally we also study the effect of the radial binning scheme on the model fitting .",
    "we typically use @xmath3 bins in the tangential distortion profiles ; finer or coarser binning may change the results , because the intrinsic ellipticity noise contribution to the measurement errors is sensitive to the radial binning that determines the number of background galaxies contained in each radial annulus . the triangles",
    "show typical variations in the parameters when varying the bin number in the range @xmath280 $ ] , confirming that the best - fit parameters do not change significantly .",
    "this is partly because the effect of substructures on the azimuthally averaged tangential profile do not largely change with the radial bin variations .",
    "the possible biases are again small compared to the statistical errors .",
    "a chance projection of foreground / background mass structures can potentially affect the cluster parameter determination based on the `` non - local '' distortion profile , which is sensitive to the total interior mass in projection .",
    "it can locally boost the surface mass density , and hence can affect the tangential distortion measurement if this physically unassociated mass structure is contained within the measurement radius . for the determination of the nfw concentration parameter , it can lead to either an under- or over - estimation of the concentration depending on the apparent position of the projected mass structure .",
    "one way to overcome this is to utilize the convergence profile to examine the cluster mass profile , by locally masking out the contribution of the known foreground / background structure in the reconstructed mass map ( appendix  [ sec : massmap ] ; also see umetsu et al .",
    "2008 for the case of a2261 )",
    ". it should be again worth noting that these projection effects are averaged out in the stacked lensing signals .",

    "the projection effect is studied in more detail in our subsequent paper , confirming an insignificant projection effect for the current measurements ( oguri et al .",

    "the shape measurement method may involve systematic errors . as studied in detail by the step project ( massey et al .",
    "2007 ; heymans et al .  2007 ) , the various shape measurement methods developed to date differ in galaxy ellipticity measurements by up to a multiplicative bias of @xmath281 .",

    "the resulting distortion profiles were identical within the measurement errors to those based on the ksb methods described earlier in this paper . in summary ,",

    "the mass maps of individual clusters are shown in appendix  [ sec : massmap ] .",
    "since the shear and mass density fields are equivalent in the weak lensing regime , the mass maps do not carry any additional information on cluster parameters .",

    "an important feature of these models will be the use of pseudo - elliptical nfw models ( golse et al . , 2001 ) and inclusion of multiple halos in the models to capture the full two - dimensional structure of the clusters in the plane of the sky .",
    "jing & suto ( 2002 ) have also used numerical simulations to show that cdm halos are better fitted by a triaxial mass distribution than a spherical nfw model even in the statistical average sense , as naturally expected from collision - less nature of cdm particles .",
    "this is a very interesting possibility that has been explored recently by oguri et al .",

    "2010 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to compare our results on the distribution of cluster concentrations with the high concentration results obtained for several well - known strong lensing clusters , notably a1689 , cl0024 and ms2137 ( gavazzi et al .",

    "2009 ) . the important difference , beyond sample size , between these detailed single - object studies and our statistical study is that our cluster sample is unbiased with respect to the prevalence of strong - lensing arcs in the cluster cores ( figure  [ fig : lx_vs_z ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : c - m ] , the massive clusters in our sample generally have the lowest statistical errors , and indeed have low concentrations , @xmath299 ; i.e.  consistent with the simulation results . on the other hand , there are clusters displaying relatively high concentrations @xmath300 . an important test of the joint interpretation of our statistical results with those of single - object studies will be whether the presence of strong - lensing arcs in clusters is correlated with the high concentration of the cluster . increased sample size and joint strong / weak - lens modeling will both be central to this investigation .    vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) recently claimed very tight cosmological constraints based on the cluster mass functions at @xmath294 derived from chandra observations under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the relationship between @xmath0-ray observables and mass was calibrated using numerical simulations ( kravtsov et al .",
    "2006 ; nagai et al .  2007 ;",
    "vikhlinin et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the level of residual uncertainty in the absolute mass calibration was assessed by comparing the @xmath0-ray derived masses with the lensing mass estimates of hoekstra ( 2007 ) , claiming possible @xmath271-level residual uncertainties in the mass estimate . however , our results indicate that the lensing masses estimated at @xmath294 are sensitive to dilution of the weak - lensing signal by faint cluster galaxies , cluster masses being underestimated by @xmath301 at @xmath294 if dilution is not properly corrected for .",
    "therefore , if the absolute mass calibration primarily rests on the comparison with the lensing masses , the @xmath0-ray derived masses may still involve additional biases . in this sense ,",
    "a further large detailed comparison of @xmath0-ray and lensing masses for joint @xmath0-ray and lensing cluster samples is crucial . in particular detailed _ cluster - by - cluster",
    "_ comparison will be very important to pin down the sources of systematic errors due to physical differences between the clusters .",

    "we typically used the color - magnitude information , e.g. the @xmath302-@xmath303 information , to separate cluster members from non - members . note that because we focus on relatively low - redshift clusters , most non - member galaxies are very likely background galaxies thanks to the deep imaging data and the limited volume that lies between us and each cluster . to define the galaxy samples ,",
    "we first analyze the data using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in the dual - image mode , using the redder passband ( typically @xmath303-band ) for source detection .",
    "we extract all objects with isophotal areas larger than 10 contiguous pixels where each pixel ( @xmath304 ) needs to be @xmath305 of the local sky background .",
    "we calculate for each source the total magnitude in the ab - magnitude system using the mag_auto parameter .",
    "colors are calculated using the mag_aper parameters with the aperture size being set to 10 pixels in diameter .",
    "early - type cluster galaxies occupy a narrow well - defined locus , the so - called red sequence , in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "red sequence galaxies were selected as follows .",
    "first , point - sources were removed from the object catalog , and then the following relation ( or its equivalent in the case that different filters were available ) was fitted to galaxies brighter than 22nd magnitude in the redder filter : @xmath306 the best - fit values of @xmath307 and @xmath308 were determined such that the number of galaxies contained in the red - sequence is maximized allowing the red - sequence to have a finite width such as @xmath309 depending on the tightness of the observed color - magnitude relation .",
    "for example , the green points in figure  [ fig : cmr ] show the member galaxy sample for a68 .    in a few cases ,",
    "multiple combinations of the parameters @xmath307 and @xmath308 were found to fit the data . in such cases we identified the sequence that is most likely one inferred from the cluster redshift based on a passive evolution model of galaxy color and magnitude .",
    "interestingly , as discussed in appendix  [ sec : massmap ] , galaxies sitting in other red - sequences generally coincide with peaks in the weak - lensing mass maps , suggesting that they correspond to over - densities at other redshifts .",
    "we also identify the brightest cluster galaxy ( hereafter bcg ) in each cluster , and defined the nominal center of each cluster as the angular position of the bcg in each cluster .",
    "note that in some clusters the bcg does not sit on the red - sequence  we therefore visually checked such clusters to ensure correct identification of bcgs .",
    "the bcgs and the galaxies contained in the red - sequence with a finite width , which are all brighter than 22 mag ( ab ) , gives our member galaxy sample .",
    "this member galaxy sample is used to estimate the number density field as well as the luminosity density field of cluster galaxies for comparison with the lensing mass maps in appendix  [ sec : massmap ] .",
    "magnitude - selected background galaxy samples have often been used in previous studies of cluster weak lensing .",
    "although our main results are based on color - selected galaxies , we first define here our magnitude - selected , or `` faint '' galaxy samples .",
    "these samples are mainly used as a suite of reference samples against which our more sophisticated color - selection methods can be compared .    to ensure that the shape of galaxies can be measured reliably , the `` background '' galaxies used for weak - lensing analyses",
    "are required to be both well - resolved and have a sufficiently large integrated signal - to - noise ratio . on the latter point , we restrict our attention to galaxies with signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath310 as calculated with the imcat software . we also select galaxies with a half - light radius , @xmath311 , in the range @xmath312 , where @xmath313 and @xmath314 are the median and rms of the half - light radii of stellar objects selected over the entire suprime - cam fov .",
    "note that the upper limit of @xmath315 is chosen based on trial and error to avoid galaxies with saturated pixels and/or strange shapes typically originating from superpositions of two or more galaxies ( e.g.  okabe & umetsu 2008 ) . ] .",
    "then the faint galaxy sample is defined from the resolved , high signal - to - noise galaxies as those lying in the apparent magnitude ranges listed in table  [ tab : wl_para ]  typically @xmath316 .",
    "the bright magnitude limit is designed to minimize contamination of this sample by bright cluster members , and corresponds to the apparent magnitude of @xmath317 for an early - type galaxy at the median redshift of a cluster in our sample .",
    "the faint limit is a consequence of the signal - to - noise and size cuts discussed above .",
    "several authors have shown that faint galaxy samples such as those described above suffer contamination by faint cluster galaxies , and therefore weak - shear measurements based on such samples are diluted by cluster and foreground ( and thus unlensed ) galaxies ( e.g.  broadhurst et al .",
    "2005 ; limousin et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this paper",
    "we employ the method described by medezinski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and umetsu & broadhurst ( 2008 ) .",
    "first , to quantify the dilution effect we calculate the mean distortion strength of each cluster by averaging the tangential distortion profile ( eq .  [ [ eq:1d_gt ] ] ) over a range of radial bins : @xmath318 where @xmath319 runs over the radial bin labels , @xmath320 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1d_gt ] ) and @xmath321 is the total number of the radial bins used .",
    "the cluster lensing signals are greater with decreasing cluster - centric radius , and therefore this calculation assigns a greater weight to the lensing signals closer to the cluster center than those towards the edge of the fov .",
    "this is useful when quantifying the effect of dilution , because dilution is expected to be more significant at smaller cluster - centric radii as it roughly traces the cluster mass distribution , while the lensing distortion signals are non - local ( non - vanishing even beyond the virial radius ) and slowly decreasing with increasing radius .",
    "note that we do not include the lensing signals at very small radii @xmath322 , because on these scales the signals are very noisy due to the small numbers of galaxies in these radial bins , in addition to the impact of uncertainties in the cluster center position .",
    "as described above , sextractor was used to build the photometric catalogs , while imcat was used to measure galaxy shapes .",
    "therefore , before varying the color - selection criteria , it was necessary to match the sextractor and imcat catalogs . in doing so , we define the following matching criteria . for each object in the imcat catalog , the closest neighbor on the sky in the sextractor catalog is identified ; if positional difference between the two catalogs is less than 2 pixels ( @xmath323 ) , then the two objects are regarded as the same object , and otherwise are rejected . if we find multiple candidates in this matching procedure , although very rare , we take the one with the closest total magnitude as the corresponding object .",
    "( 90mm,90mm)f13.ps    figure  [ fig : dilution ] shows , for a68 as a typical example , the mean distortion strengths as a function of the varying background galaxy samples , where each galaxy sample is selected from the faint galaxy sample by further requiring that galaxies are redder or bluer than the red - sequence ( the vertical dashed line ) by a given color offset in the horizontal axis from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig_g+ ] ) . ] .",
    "note that the data points in the different color bins are highly correlated because each data point includes all galaxies at larger color offsets than the offset at which the point is plotted .",
    "first let us consider the results for galaxy samples redder than the red - sequence ",
    "i.e. right - ward of the vertical dashed line .",
    "the distortion strength changes as the color - cut becomes progressively redder due to both reduced cluster member contamination and to the change in average redshift of galaxies .",
    "all other things being equal the distortion strength should , in principle , become insensitive to color - offset when the color - cut is sufficiently large so as to render contamination and thus dilution negligible . in the case of a68",
    ", we therefore adopt a color cut of @xmath324 , as shown by the vertical red line .",
    "the background galaxy redshift distribution is expected to vary slowly with color offset , suggesting that the relatively abrupt jump in distortion strength either side of the vertical red line is contamination - related .",
    "similar red - side color - cuts are adopted for the other clusters , with values lying in the range @xmath325 $ ] .",
    "following the same logic on the blue - side we adopt a color - cut of @xmath326 and mark this with a vertical blue line ; in this case the insensitivity of distortion strength at the blue - side cut is more obvious than the red - side discussed above .",
    "the blue - side color - cuts are in the range of @xmath327 $ ] for the entire cluster sample .",
    "we then use the combined red@xmath328blue galaxy samples in our lensing analysis throughout this paper . despite the care that we have taken over the color - selection of background galaxies ,",
    "the rather limited color information that we have used here will inevitably allow some unlensed galaxies to leak into the red@xmath328blue galaxy catalogs . nevertheless , we are able to prove that our red@xmath328blue samples are less affected by the contamination than the faint galaxy sample . the effectiveness of our color selection methods is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nprofile ] .",
    "our method may be compared to alternative method where the dilution effect is corrected for by multiplying the measured distortion signal at a given radial bin with a correction factor inferred from the increased number density of faint galaxies at the radius ( e.g. , see kneib et al.2003 ; hoekstra 2007 ) . in this method , the stacked number density profile , as shown in figure  [ fig : nprofile ] , are usually used to infer the correction factor , because a measurement of the number density profile is noisy for individual cluster field  we have also found that we can not necessarily find a clear increase in the number density of faint galaxies at small cluster - centric radii for a single cluster field .",
    "therefore this alternative method does not allow the cluster - by - cluster correction of dilution .",
    "our method using a color - selected galaxy sample can thus be recognized as a more direct , unbiased way in a sense that our method purely rests on the lensing shape measurements and do not employ any correction factor to obtain cleaner distortion signals . we are planning to further improve the dilution correction with more accurate photometric redshifts obtained by adding more passband data , which is also invaluable to calibrate the source redshift uncertainties .",
    "( 90mm,90mm)f14.ps    since a selection of background galaxies is important , we also made another test as follows .",
    "figure  [ fig : stacked_dilution ] shows the _ stacked _ distortion strength for 21 clusters ( 22 clusters with color information minus zwcl0740 ) against different background galaxy samples as in figure  [ fig : dilution ] , but selected with a single color offset for all the clusters . with the help of stacking the distortion strength is smoothly varying against color , and a significant dilution of lensing signals is clearly seen if including faint galaxies with color similar to color of red - sequence galaxies .",
    "also evident is the dilution strength stays constant for the color offset @xmath329 at both red- and blue - sides .",
    "note that this color offset is comparable with the color cut employed for each cluster region as listed in table  [ tab : wl_para ] , giving another confirmation that our background galaxy selection is considered secure .",
    "( 170mm,170mm)f15.ps    given the results in figure  [ fig : stacked_dilution ] , figure  [ fig : compare_dil ] studies how best - fit parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath8 , change for each cluster if the background galaxy sample defined with the single color cut @xmath330 is used , compared to the results of our fiducial red+blue galaxy samples .",
    "it can be found that the results for two different samples are consistent within the statistical errors .",
    "thus our background galaxy selection is again considered robust .",
    "even so , we believe that it is more secure to define background galaxy catalog by setting the color cut on cluster - by - cluster basis , because the slope and normalization of red - sequence is different for each cluster , and the populations of member galaxies may also significantly differ for different clusters . more color information is needed to further refine background galaxy selection based on improved photo-@xmath31 information , which is our future project .",
    "the 3d mass enclosed within a sphere of a given radius @xmath331 ( see eq .  [ [ eq : m_delta ] ] for the definition of @xmath332 in terms of the mean over - density @xmath333 ) is an important parameter to characterize the cluster mass .",
    "the lensing fields at the projected radius @xmath334 from the cluster center ( @xmath335 is the angular diameter distance up to the cluster ) are sensitive to the 2d mass enclosed within a cylinder of the radius @xmath336 between an observer and source galaxies . for an isolated nfw halo ,",

    ", the 3d mass can be inferred from the 2d mass that is directly estimated from the lensing observables in a model - independent way .",
    "this inversion holds valid if the cluster mass distribution is well represented by an nfw profile ( see  [ sec : model - independ - mass ] for the detailed discussion ) .",
    "the coherent distortion pattern measured from background galaxy images also allows to directly reconstruct the two - dimensional map of the ( projected ) total matter distribution ( kaiser & squires 1993 ) .",
    "the mass density fields between different pixels in the mass map are highly correlated , so the correlations need to be properly taken into account when extracting some useful information from the mass map ( e.g. , umetsu & broadhurst 2008 ) .",
    "even so , the mass map is sometimes useful : comparing the mass map with other wavelength information ( member galaxy distribution , @xmath0-ray and/or sz maps , and so on ) , and inferring the dynamical stages of a cluster from the mass distribution ( the presence of substructures and asphericity ) . for this reason ,",
    "we show in this appendix the mass maps for the individual clusters of our sample , comparing with the number density and luminosity density maps of member galaxies .    in the following mass maps",
    "we also show the significance contours of the mass density , relative to the @xmath55 noise level expected from the intrinsic ellipticity noise . following the method developed in van waerbeke ( 2000 ) we use the gaussian smoothing function to quantify the noise level at an arbitrary angular position in the mass map , which is given as @xmath340 where @xmath341 is the intrinsic ellipticity noise computed in the similar manner as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig_g+ ] ) : @xmath342 ^ 2 $ ] using all the galaxies used in the mass map reconstruction .",
    "the angular scale @xmath343 is the width of the gaussian smoothing function , @xmath344 , and @xmath345 is the mean number density of galaxies over the field .",
    "thus the noise level in the mass map varies for each cluster , depending on the number density of background galaxies and the smoothing scale used .",
    "_ for the following mass maps , we use the faint background galaxy sample _ , because some of our cluster samples do not have color information , so only the background galaxy selection is available for the whole sample , yielding fair comparisons between the mass maps of different clusters .",
