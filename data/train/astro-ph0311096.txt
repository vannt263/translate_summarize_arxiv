    "the possibility of non - gaussianity in the cobe - dmr 4 year maps led to a rather protracted story .",
    "using `` single-@xmath0 '' bispectrum analysis , @xcite found strong evidence for non - gaussianity in the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature .",
    "this detection was followed by similar claims by @xcite and @xcite , and caused considerable consternation among theorists ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "further work , however , showed that claims other than those based on the bispectrum could not be reproduced @xcite .",
    "the bispectrum claims were confirmed by  @xcite .    later  @xcite",
    "cast serious doubts upon the cosmological origin of the observed signal .",
    "a systematic was identified which removed the observed `` single-@xmath0 '' bispectrum signal  the so - called eclipse season data , which should never have been used .",
    "however , when an extension to `` inter-@xmath0 '' bispectrum components was sought , a new non - gaussian signal was found for inter-@xmath0 separations of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "specifically , their observed values were found to concentrate uncannily close to zero instead of displaying the scatter expected from gaussian maps .",
    "this signal could not be blamed on any systematic effects studied by  @xcite or otherwise @xcite .",
    "it was also proved that the instrument high noise levels could at most dilute the observed signal , in spite of the noise correlations and anisotropy @xcite .",
    "it was also found that the observed signal did not extend to higher inter-@xmath0 separations @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "what shall we make of these claims in the light of the recent observations @xcite by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) ? in this paper we show that they do nt survive the new data , which displays consistency with gaussianity on the angular scales probed by cobe .",
    "this might seem at first suprising , given that the wmap data is considerably less noisy than the cobe - dmr dataset , and that noise can at most hide a non - gaussian signal",
    ". however one should never forget the issue of systematics . even though documented cobe - dmr systematics were shown not to correlate with the observed non - gaussian signal , the new data allows us to cast a new look at the problem .",
    "we find that a highly non - subtle combination of quadcube pixelization systematics and the `` eclipse data '' are to be blamed for the observed effect .",
    "this , we believe , closes the story .",
    "the moral is clear : care must be exercised regarding similar claims currently being made with wmap .",
    "we start by reviewing some results and definitions pertaining to the bispectrum . given a full - sky map , @xmath3",
    ", this may be expanded into spherical harmonic functions : @xmath4 the coefficients @xmath5 may then be combined into rotationally invariant multilinear forms ( see @xcite for a possible algorithm ) .",
    "the most general cubic invariant is the bispectrum , and is given by @xmath6 where the @xmath7 is the wigner @xmath8 symbol .",
    "the proportionality constant is usually chosen in order to enforce a roughly constant cosmic variance .",
    "in @xcite the choice was made @xmath9 , leading to the `` single-@xmath0 '' bispectrum @xmath10 .",
    "other bispectrum components are sensitive to correlations between different scales .",
    "selection rules require that @xmath11 be even .",
    "the simplest chain of correlators is therefore @xmath12  the ",
    "inter-@xmath0 bispectrum  and this was studied in  @xcite .",
    "other components , involving more distant multipoles , may be considered @xcite but they are very likely to be dominated by noise ; it is natural to assume that possible non - gaussian inter - scale correlations decay with @xmath0 separation .    we shall therefore consider ratios @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "these quantities are dimensionless , and therefore less dependent upon the power spectrum .",
    "they are also invariant under rotations and parity .    the theoretical importance of the bispectrum as a non - gaussian qualifier has been recognized in a number of publications ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite measured the pseudocollapsed and equilateral three point function of the dmr four year data .",
    "the bispectrum may be regarded as the fourier space counterpart of the three point function .",
    "the wmap mission @xcite was designed to make full sky cmb maps with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "there are ten differencing assemblies ( das ) in total , four in the w band at 94 ghz , two v band at 61 ghz , two q band at 41 ghz , one ka band at 33 ghz , and one k band at 23 ghz .",
    "the k and ka bands are dominated by galactic emission and therefore neglected for cosmological analysis .",
    "the maps are made using the healpix format with nside=512 @xcite .",
    "the total number of pixels in each map is @xmath16 .",
    "we use the coadded sum map of the q , v and w maps , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the sky map for the da @xmath19 with the foreground galactic signal subtracted , and @xmath20 is the noise per observation for da i , whose values are given by @xcite .",
    "we use the publicly available foreground cleaned maps , where the galactic foreground signal , consisting of synchrotron , free - free , and dust emission , was removed using the 3-band , 5-parameter template fitting method described in @xcite .",
    "we then use the kp0 mask to cut the galactic plane emission and the known point sources ( @xcite ) , retaining 76.8% of the sky .    the monopole and dipole are removed and we perform a harmonic analysis of the map obtaining the @xmath5 up to @xmath21 .",
    "this is performed using the fortran utility anafast , available in the healpix package .",
    "we then evaluate ( [ j3 ] ) and the @xmath22 obtained for the wmap data are compared to the distributions @xmath23 obtained from gaussian simulations subject to the appropriate beam , galactic mask and noise .",
    "these simulations take as input the lcdm power - law primordial power spectrum fit to the wmap , cbi and acbar data ( @xcite ) .",
    "the random fields were generated using the utility synfast of the healpix package .",
    "the distributions so obtained do not vary significantly from those obtained previously for cobe .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "we plot the inter-@xmath0 bispectrum of several renditions of the cobe data , and of wmap .",
    "the original cobe - dmr non - gaussian inter-@xmath0 signal @xcite was found using quadcube pixelization .",
    "possible deficiencies of this scheme were evaluated by aligning the pixelization system with galactic and ecliptic coordinates .",
    "the @xmath22 in both frames are plotted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "the dotted contours represent 1 , 2 and 3 sigma lines for the bispectrum arising from gaussian realizations .",
    "one would expect to see one in three coefficients lying outside the 1-sigma contour . instead ,",
    "for cobe - dmr maps we see a very close alignment with the peak of the distribution .",
    "this gives a reduced chi squared @xmath24 and @xmath25 for data in galactic and ecliptic pixelization , respectively .",
    "computing the distributions @xmath26 leads to @xmath27 ( and @xmath28 ) for maps in galactic ( ecliptic ) pixelization .",
    "these are the confidence levels for rejecting gaussianity on the grounds of the cobe bispectrum .    as can be seen from the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the wmap bispectrum does not have such an obvious lack of scatter .",
    "indeed it leads to @xmath29 , consistent with gaussianity .    what can be the origin of this discrepancy",
    "it is at once clear that we are not comparing like with like .",
    "the wmap project used the healpix pixelization scheme , and the tests made for the impact of quadcube upon the cobe map may not be conclusive . for example there may be an isotropic systematic effect , present no matter how one orients the coordinate system . to address this in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plotted ( solid line in bottom panel ) the @xmath22 from cobe 4 year maps rendered in healpix .",
    "we found @xmath30 , reducing the confidence level to 96% .",
    "hence the cobe / wmap discrepancy can partly be blamed on a poor pixelization scheme , but this is not enough : even in the healpix rendition cobe is much more non - gaussian than wmap .",
    "could we have missed the non - gaussian signal in wmap by looking at the wrong combination of frequencies ?",
    "equation ( [ coadd ] ) favours the q band , which is the most contaminated by galactic emission .",
    "galactic emissions have been proved to degrade non - gaussian large angle signals @xcite . however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] there is a remarkable consistency between the bispectrum observed in all wmap channels , a tribute to the very high signal to noise , but also to the lack of galactic contamination . by way of contrast",
    "the cobe inter-@xmath0 non - gaussian signal came mainly from the 53 ghz channel , which was also the least noisy channel .",
    "a related possible source of discrepancy is the galactic mask .",
    "the kp0 mask is significantly smaller than the extended galactic cut used in cobe @xcite .",
    "could the extra regions near the galactic plane hide a non - gaussian signal ? as the bottom pannel in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows this is not the case .",
    "subjecting the wmap data to the extended cut used by the cobe team in fact increases the wmap chi squared to @xmath31 .",
    "it would therefore appear that nothing has been missed , and that the wmap bispectrum on `` cobe '' large angular scales is indeed consistent with gaussianity .",
    "given that the higher noise levels in the cobe maps can at most dilute a non - gaussian signal ( a fact proved in @xcite even after taking noise correlations into account ) , we may conclude that a systematic error is behind the cobe non - gaussian signal .",
    "nevertheless , identifying the culprit is far from obvious : no documented cobe systematic mimics the observed inter-@xmath0 signal .",
    "the effects of the eclipse data @xcite on the @xmath22 , for example , are assessed in the top panel of fig .",
    "they give @xmath32 , leading a confidence level for rejecting gaussianity of @xmath33 .",
    "it turns out , however , that if we reject data collected during the eclipse season _ and _ construct a dmr 4-year map in healpix the puzzle is solved .",
    "this is shown in the middle panel in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we have plotted the @xmath22 inferred from such ( co - added ) maps .",
    "although the difference might look subtle , there is quite a substantial difference around @xmath34 .",
    "in fact the reduced chi squared in now @xmath35 , consistent with gaussianity .",
    "curiously the single-@xmath0 non - gaussian signal found by @xcite results mainly from @xmath36 at @xmath34 .",
    "this stops being a severe deviant once the eclipse data is excluded .",
    "it would now appear that the same happens for the @xmath37 , but only after a better pixelization scheme is introduced .",
    "the conclusion is that a combination of pixelization effects and the `` eclipse '' systematic is behind the inter-@xmath0 non - gaussian effect previously reported for cobe maps .",
    "curiously if we take a difference map ( cobe minus wmap ) the anomalous alignment of the @xmath22 is not present ( see top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . on the scales we are considering such maps picture cobe noise , plus cobe systematics , minus wmap systematics ( assumed to be small ) .",
    "thus one would expect the cobe @xmath22 signal to be enhanced in the difference map .",
    "the fact that it is not results from the non - linearity of the statistic being used , plus the subtle interplay of signal and systematic via the quadcube pixelization scheme .    in this paper",
    "we have concentrated on @xmath37 , because the single scale bispectrum anomalies have been explained long ago .",
    "however we have checked that no new anomalies on large angular scales emerge in the wmap data .",
    "we reserve to a future publication a complete study of the bispectrum of wmap of smaller angular scales . to our mind",
    "the work of @xcite is just the beginning .",
