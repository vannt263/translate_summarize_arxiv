    "grand unified theories ( guts ) are very attractive models in which the three gauge groups are unified at a high energy scale .",
    "however , one of the most serious problems to construct a model of guts is how to realize the mass splitting between the triplet and the doublet higgs particles in the higgs sector .",
    "this problem is so - called triplet - doublet ( td ) splitting problem .",
    "a new idea for solving the td splitting problem has been suggested in higher dimensional guts where the extra dimensional coordinates are compactified on orbifolds@xcite-@xcite . in these scenarios , higgs and gauge fields",
    "are propagating in extra dimensions , and the orbifolding realizes the gauge group reduction and the td splitting since the doublet ( triplet ) higgs fields have ( not ) kaluza - klein zero - modes .",
    "a lot of attempts and progresses have been done in the extra dimensional guts on orbifolds@xcite-@xcite .",
    "especially , the reduction of @xmath1 gauge symmetry and the td splitting solution are first considered in 6d models in refs .",
    "@xcite .    as for producing fermion mass hierarchies ,",
    "several trials have been done in the extra dimensional guts on orbifolds@xcite .",
    "the model in ref .",
    "@xcite can induce the natural fermion mass hierarchies and flavor mixings by introducing extra vector - like generations which propagate 6 and 5 dimensions , respectively .",
    "assuming that 4th ( 5th ) generation vector - like fields only couple to the 1st ( 2nd ) generation chiral fields , the suitable fermion mass hierarchies and flavor mixings are generated by integrating out these vector - like heavy fields .",
    "the mixing angles between the chiral fields and extra generations have been determined by the volume suppression factors .",
    "the gauge and higgs fields live in 6 dimensions with the anomaly - free contents , and the orbifolding and boundary conditions make the @xmath1 gauge group be broken to @xmath6 and realize the td splitting .    in this paper",
    "we will suggest an alternative , much simpler scenario based on the 6d @xmath0 susy @xmath1 gut on @xmath7 . for matter fields",
    ", we do not introduce extra vector - like generations in extra dimensions as in ref .",
    ". we will introduce 6d and 5d vector - like matter fields which contains the 1st and 2nd generation matter fields as the zero modes , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the 3rd generation matter fields are located on a 4d brane .",
    "the yukawa couplings for the 6d and 5d fields are suppressed by volume factors .",
    "then , as the result , the suitable fermion mass hierarchies and flavor mixings are generated at low energy .",
    "we consider the 6d @xmath0 susy @xmath1 gut with the vector - like matter contents , whose extra dimensional coordinates are compactified on a @xmath2 orbifold@xcite .",
    "the structure of extra 2d spaces are characterized by reflection @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xmath11 , and translations @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) . under the reflection @xmath8 and @xmath10 , @xmath14 is transformed into @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the physical space of @xmath19 . under the translation @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath14 are transformed into @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the physical space can be taken as @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the @xmath7 orbifold is just the same as the @xmath28 orbifold of a regular square .",
    "there are four fixed points at @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and two fixed lines on @xmath33 and @xmath34 on the orbifold .",
    "the bulk fields are decomposed by @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath12 . for examples",
    ", a 6d bulk scalar field @xmath35 is decomposed into @xmath36 according to the eigenvalues of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "notice that only @xmath39 can have massless zero - modes and survives in the low energy .",
    "we consider the gauge multiplet and two @xmath40 representation higgs multiplets propagate in the 6d bulk , which are denoted as @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we adopted the translations as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which commute with the generators of the georgi - glashow @xmath45@xcite and the flipped @xmath46@xcite groups , respectively@xcite .",
    "then , translations ( @xmath12 ) make the @xmath1 gauge group be broken to @xmath6 and realize the td splitting since the doublet ( triplet ) higgs fields have ( not ) kaluza - klein zero - modes .    the zero mode of the 6d bulk matter field , @xmath47 , is classified into four types as @xmath48 similarly , the zero mode of the 5d bulk field , which is propagating on the fixed line @xmath49 , is classified into @xmath50 where the 2nd @xmath51 sign represents the @xmath20 parity .",
    "now let us discuss matter contents in our model . in fig.[fig",
    "] we show the the matter configuration on the orbifold .",
    "we introduce the 3rd generation matter fields , @xmath52 of so(10 ) , on the 4d brane , @xmath30 .",

    "we also introduce two 5d bulk fields , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which contain zero mode components @xmath62 and @xmath63 of @xmath45 , and they are denoted as @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . in 6d bulk , we introduce 6d bulk vector - like fields , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which contain the 1st generation @xmath59 of @xmath45 as the zero mode . notice that this matter content induces the gauge anomaly neither on the 4d brane nor in 5d and 6d bulks .",
    "we also introduce the 4d brane - localized higgs fields , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , at @xmath30 , which are assumed to take vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of @xmath70 gev in the directions of @xmath71 .",
    "we impose the peccei - quinn symmetry and its charge on the multiplets : the matter fields , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 have zero , other matter multiplets have @xmath74 , @xmath75 representation higgs multiplets have @xmath76 , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 representation higgs multiplets have @xmath79 .",
    "the superpotential of the brane - localized matter fields is given by @xmath80 in which @xmath81 is an ultraviolet cut - off scale of @xmath82 gev .",
    "in addition to the superpotential in eq.([yukawa1 ] ) , there are the following interactions between the brane - localized fields and the bulk fields on the 4d brane , @xmath30 , @xmath83 we identify the zero modes of @xmath84 and @xmath85 as the 1st and 2nd @xmath86 massless matter fields , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively . below the compactification scale , the interactions in eq.([w6 ] ) induce the following yukawa couplings for the zero modes . @xmath89",
    "the 1st and 2nd generation @xmath86 multiplets of @xmath56 give the volume suppression factor @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , which are given by @xmath92 these volume suppression factors play crucial roles for generating the fermion mass matrices in the low energy .",
    "now we set @xmath93 gev , which means @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the cabibbo angle , @xmath96 .",
    "although the bulk higgs fields @xmath97 and @xmath98 also induce the volume suppression factor , @xmath90 , this effect is not available in the low energy by assuming the original yukawa couplings @xmath99s , @xmath100s being of @xmath101 in eqs.(4 ) and ( 6 ) and @xmath102 , on the 4d brane , @xmath103 , there are no volume suppressions for the higgs fields , where the original yukawa couplings @xmath99s , @xmath100s are of @xmath104 in eqs.(4 ) and ( 6 ) . in this case",
    ", however , td splitting should be solved by other mechanisms . ] .    for other unwanted matter multiplets , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ,",
    "the zero modes become heavy through the mass terms @xmath105 on @xmath103 , where we set the diagonal bases of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , for simplicity .",
    "it suggests that these unwanted matter fields decouple in the low energy .",
    "therefore the particle contents at the low energy become the same as those of the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) with right - handed neutrinos .    now let us show the mass matrices of the quarks and leptons . from eqs.([yukawa1 ] ) and ( [ w_4 ] ) , the mass matrices of the ordinal matter fields are given by @xmath108 for the up quark sector , the down quark sector , and the charged lepton sector , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xmath109 and @xmath110 are the vacuum expectation values of the weak higgs doublets .",
    "we write the mass matrices in the basis that the left - handed fermions are to the left and the right - handed fermions are to the right .",
    "we notice that all elements in the mass matrices have @xmath104 coefficients .",
    "the fermion mass hierarchies are given by @xmath111 with the large @xmath112 .",
    "the mass matrix of three light neutrinos @xmath113 through the see - saw mechanism@xcite is given by @xmath114 @xmath115 is about @xmath116 gev induced from the interaction @xmath117 on @xmath30 .",
    "we can obtain the suitable mass scale ( @xmath118 ev ) for the atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments , by taking account of the @xmath1 relation , @xmath119 .",
    "as for the flavor mixings , the ckm@xcite and the mns@xcite matrices are given by @xmath120 which realize the suitable flavor mixings roughly in order of magnitudes .",
    "they give us a natural explanation why the flavor mixing in the quark sector is small while the flavor mixing in the lepton sector is large@xcite-@xcite . for the suitable values of @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and down quark and electron masses",
    ", we need suitable choice of @xmath104 coefficients in mass matrices as in ref .",
    "@xcite . or , if @xmath104 coefficients are not determined by a specific reason ( symmetry ) in the fundamental theory , it is meaningful to see the most probable hierarchies and mixing angles by considering random @xmath104 coefficients@xcite . anyway , if the fermion mass hierarchies and flavor mixing angles should be determined from the fundamental theory in _ order _",
    "( power of @xmath95 ) not by tunings of @xmath104 coefficients , we should modify our mechanism .",
    "the modification in our scenario can be achieved in a simple way .",
    "we introduce a @xmath60 matter hyper - multiplet with pq - charge 1 on @xmath34 , instead of the brane - localized @xmath123 . by identifying the zero mode of this matter field as the 1st generation @xmath124 of @xmath56 ,",
    "the 1st generation @xmath124 induces a volume suppression factor , @xmath125 , similar to the case of @xmath126 representations . by this modification",
    ", we can obtain the modified mass matrices of quarks and leptons , which can induce the suitable values of @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and down quark and electron masses ( this type of mass matrices is the modification i in ref .",
    "furthermore , when we introduce @xmath127 and @xmath128 , in 6d bulk , and two @xmath60s on @xmath34 ( these bulk fields contain @xmath124 matter fields of @xmath56 as the zero modes ) , and identify the zero modes @xmath124 fields as 1st and 2nd , 3rd generations , respectively , we can obtain mass matrices of the small @xmath112 case in the similar manner ( modification ii in ref .",
    "in this paper , we have shown the models based on the 6d @xmath129 susy @xmath1 gut where the 5th and 6th dimensional coordinates are compactified on a @xmath2 orbifold .",
    "the gauge and higgs fields live in 6 dimensions .",
    "the td splitting and the gauge symmetry reduction are realized by the orbifolding .",
    "the matter fields are contained with the anomaly - free contents .",
    "we introduce the 6d and 5d matter fields , which contains the 1st and 2nd generation fields as the zero modes , respectively .",
    "the yukawa couplings for the bulk fields are suppressed by the volume factors .",
    "the fermion mass hierarchy has been realized , since the 1st ( 2nd ) generation fields propagate in 6d ( 5d ) .",
    "we have shown that the suitable fermion mass hierarchies and flavor mixings are generated by the volume suppression factors originated from extra dimensions .",
    "let us briefly discuss the susy breaking mechanisms . in the gaugino mediation scenario @xcite , the susy breaking field , @xmath130 , are located at a different fixed point from our brane , @xmath30 .",
    "then the gauginos obtain the susy breaking masses from the interaction with @xmath130 .",
    "the susy breaking for brane - localize matter fields are generated through the quantum effects of the gaugino masses . while the matter fields in extra dimensions can directly couple to the susy breaking fields , where non - universal contributions to susy breaking masses can be generated in general .",
    "since these non - universal susy breaking masses can give rise to too large flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) , the location of the susy breaking brane should be determined in order to avoid the large fcnc phenomenological problems in the gaugino mediation scenario@xcite . on the other hand , in the gauge mediation scenario",
    ", we can put the messenger sector on the 4d brane , @xmath103 , as in ref .",
    "the susy breaking masses for the light matter fields are highly degenerated where the fcncs are naturally suppressed as in the ordinal 4d gauge mediation models . for other susy breaking scenarios , the non - universal corrections to the soft susy masses can be arisen in the gravity mediation scenario in general .",
    "it is because the susy breaking effects are mediated by `` yukawa '' interactions not by gauge interactions .",
    "the `` yukawa '' interactions among the bulk fields always receive the volume suppressions , which violate the degeneracy of the soft susy breaking masses .",
    "the scherk - schwarz susy breaking @xcite might also give the non - negligible effects of breaking degeneracy , since the first and the second generation fields are mainly composed by the bulk fields in our models .",
