    "dilepton spectra taken in heavy - ion collisions exhibit an enhancement of yield , independent of the bombarding - energy , compared to the superposition of free hadronic decays in the invariant - mass region @xmath20 . while the dilepton enhancement found at sps energies",
    "has been related to modifications of the @xmath21-meson spectral function in the hadronic medium @xcite , the large pair yields observed by dls @xcite in c+c and ca+ca collisions at 1 gev / u remain to be explained .",
    "the high - acceptance dielectron spectrometer hades @xcite at gsi , darmstadt , is presently the only dilepton spectrometer operational in the sis energy regime of , succeeding the dls experiment . first results obtained in c+c collisions at 2 gev / u confirmed the general observation of an enhanced pair yield above the contribution expected from hadron decays after freeze - out @xcite . in this note",
    "we report on a measurement of inclusive electron - pair emission from @xmath1c+@xmath1c collisions at 1 gev / u . taken together ,",
    "both results allow to discuss the beam energy dependence of the pair yield .",
    "furthermore a direct comparison with the dls results @xcite has become possible , thus addressing ( and solving experimentally ) the long - standing `` dls puzzle '' .",
    "the dielectron yield measured in hades in @xmath1c+@xmath1c collisions at 1 gev / u was corrected for detection and reconstruction inefficiencies as described in @xcite . fig .  [ fig1 ] shows the resulting @xmath22 invariant - mass distribution of true pairs normalized to the average number of charged pions @xmath23 , as measured also in hades and extrapolated to the full solid angle .",
    "the obtained pion multiplicity per participant nucleon , i.e. @xmath24 , agrees well with previous measurements of charged and neutral pions @xcite .",
    "the quoted error of @xmath25 is dominated by systematic uncertainties in the pion efficiency correction and the extrapolation procedure .",
    "in addition to this overall normalization error , uncertainties caused by the electron - efficiency correction and by the subtraction of the combinatorial background add up quadratically to point - to - point systematic errors in the pair yield of @xmath26 ( also shown in fig .",

    "in addition , the ratio of cocktail b and a for 1 gev / u data is indicated ( dashed line ) . ]    we compare our data with a pair cocktail ( cocktail a ) , which was calculated from @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 meson decays to represent the radiation from long - lived mesons ( decaying mostly outside the fireball ) .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 dalitz yields are constrained by published data @xcite ; for the production rate of the @xmath30 meson we apply @xmath31-scaling @xcite .",
    "the cocktail calculation was performed with the pluto generator assuming anisotropic meson emission from a boltzmann - like thermal source ( for details cf .",
    "while experimental data and agree in the @xmath28 dalitz region , the cocktail strongly underestimates the measured pair yield for @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "this is not surprising , since one expects additional contributions from short - lived resonances , e.g. @xmath34 and @xmath21 . for the @xmath27",
    ", we assumed that its contribution scales with the @xmath28 yield at freeze - out and that the @xmath35 differential decay rates of @xcite are applicable .",
    "we modeled the broad resonance @xmath21 as a breit - wigner shape , with mass - dependent width @xmath36 ( @xmath37 gev ) @xcite , additionally modified by @xmath31-scaling accounting for the strongly reduced phase space at low beam energies .",
    "the resulting cocktail b is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( long - dashed line ) .",
    "adding these short - lived contributions increases the simulated yield above @xmath38 @xmath33 , but obviously our second calculation also falls short of reproducing the data .",
    "more sophisticated calculations , e.g. based on transport models , are clearly needed . for better visualization of the character of the excess yield",
    ", the ratio of data and cocktail a is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "this ratio is basically unity at low masses , where @xmath28 dalitz pairs dominate , but above @xmath39 @xmath33 it is large , indicating the onset of processes not accounted for by our cocktail a. fig .  [",
    "fig1](b ) also shows the corresponding ratio observed at 2 gev / u @xcite .",
    "it is evident that at 1 gev / u the overshoot of the data is much stronger than at 2 gev / u .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that the beam energy dependence of the excess yield above the known @xmath29 contribution @xcite , integrated over the @xmath2 mass range , scales like @xmath40 production @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the pair transverse momentum ( @xmath41 ) distribution for the excess region @xmath2 .",
    "note that in comparison to cocktail a the excess factor is constant at high @xmath41 , but increases steeply towards lower @xmath41 .",
    "-.5in0 in     for the invariant - mass region @xmath2 .",
    "line codes as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . ]    a direct comparison of hades and dls @xcite results can be achieved by a mapping of the measured hades pair yield onto the dls acceptance , defined in the 3-d space spanned by the pair variables @xmath42 and the rapidity @xmath43 .",
    "although the both apparatuses do not fully overlap for low - mass , low-@xmath44 pairs , in the excess region , the hades coverage is larger and almost fully contains the dls acceptance .",
    "transforming the multiplicities measured by hades to cross sections , this mapping allows for an almost model - independent comparison of the two data sets ( for details cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the hades - mapped invariant - mass distribution is shown together with the dls it is apparent that , within statistical and systematic uncertainties , both measurements are in agreement , in particular in the region of the excess yield .",
    "the same conclusion is obtained from the comparison of the @xmath44 distributions @xcite .",
    "-.5in0 in    c+@xmath1c at 1 gev / u by hades ( full triangles ) and at 1.04 gev / u by dls @xcite ( empty triangles ) .",
    "the invariant - mass distributions are compared within the dls acceptance .",
    "statistical and systematic errors are shown .",
    "overall normalization errors ( not shown ) are @xmath45 for the hades and @xmath46 for the dls data points . ]",
    "the agreement of the present data with the  for a long time disputed  results solves the `` dls puzzle '' experimentally .",
    "it poses , however , again the question of the origin of the pair excess . in this context ,",
    "studies of the elementary reactions @xmath47 and @xmath48 are important steps .",
    "indeed , recent calculations within a one boson exchange ( obe ) model @xcite suggest significantly larger than heretofore assumed contributions from @xmath49 and , mostly , @xmath50 quasi - elastic bremsstrahlung",
    ". moreover , transport calculations done with the hadron string dynamics ( hsd ) model @xcite using a parametrization of bremsstrahlung inspired by the new obe result @xcite seem to match both the hades and the dls @xmath1c+@xmath1c data .",
    "in this situation it is evident that the direct confrontation of the obe model calculations with @xmath47 and @xmath48 dilepton data measured with hades @xcite is mandatory to reach firm conclusions on the origin of dileptons at sis energies .",
