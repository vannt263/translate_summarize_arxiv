    "ever since the pioneering works of wigner and dyson @xcite , random matrix theory has been a major tool in the investigation of complex systems in physics , see _ e.g. _ refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the three `` classical '' random matrix ensembles , the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) and the gaussian sympletic ensemble ( gse ) have been studied in much detail @xcite and have proven of relevance in various applications , not alone in physics , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for examples .",
    "one of the characteristic features that is frequently used in investigations is the distribution of differences between eigenvalues .",
    "these level - spacing distributions are universal quantities , in the sense that they correctly describe the level - spacing distributions in many complex systems . in many applications ,",
    "experimentally observed or numerically calculated discrete data , such as energy levels of large nuclei , are analyzed and their spacing distribution is compared to that of the appropriate random matrix ensemble , where the choice of the appropriate ensemble is dictated by the symmetry of the system . besides the spacing between neighboring levels , also the spacing between levels separated by a fixed number of levels , _",
    "i.e. _ , next - nearest neighbors , next - next - nearest neighbors , _ etc .",
    "_ , has been considered .",
    "a recent example of an astonishingly precise agreement between energy levels of a hamiltonian and random matrix distributions was found in a simple tight - binding model of an electron moving on a planar quasiperiodic graph @xcite , which is used to model electrons in quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "but the distribution functions of random matrix theory are even of relevance in pure mathematics ; the paradigm of an application in number theory is the distribution of zeros of riemann s zeta function on the critical line @xcite",
    ".    however , there exists no simple closed form for the level - spacing distributions of the above - mentioned ensembles of random matrix theory .",
    "thus , in many cases , the empirical data are actually compared to a so - called wigner surmise , which corresponds to the spacing distribution of neighboring levels obtained from two - by - two random matrices , rather than from the limiting distribution for matrices of infinite size .",
    "for example , in the goe case , the difference between the wigner surmise and the true goe spacing distribution is rather small , but the example of the quasiperiodic tight - binding model @xcite shows that it may indeed be detected in physical applications . for the gue case ,",
    "the situation is somewhat better as the complete small spacing expansion for the nearest neighbor spacing distribution is known @xcite .",
    "numerical values , series expansions and a pad analysis for the nearest - neighbor spacing distributions can be found in @xcite . however , level spacings beyond the nearest - neighbor distributions , the spacing distributions of levels separated by a number of other levels , have scarcely been considered . however , explicit power series expressions are available @xcite , although the coefficients in the series still involve determinants that need to be evaluated .    here",
    "we employ the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the relation to differential equations of painlev type discovered by jimbo _ at al . _",
    "@xcite , to obtain series expansions or numerical estimates of these functions , compare also @xcite for connections between random matrices and painlev transcendents . in this paper , we generalize this approach to calculate series expansions for small spacings up to order @xmath0 for the higher level - spacing distributions of the gue .",
    "the expansions provide a detailed account of the small - spacing behavior of these distributions , and thus can be applied to analyze data .",
    "the exact coefficients involve ratios of large integer numbers , which makes them somewhat difficult to present in a paper .",
    "therefore , the analytic expressions of the expansion coefficients are not included ; they are provided in form of mathematica @xcite code on the author s homepage @xcite .",
    "the other two classical ensembles , the goe and the gse , can be treated in a similar fashion , although the calculation is somewhat more involved @xcite .",
    "the results for these two universality classes will be published separately .",
    "why are we interested in calculating these expansion to such high order in @xmath1 ?",
    "there are several reasons .",
    "first of all , the data suggest that the series have infinite radius of convergence , thus the level - spacing distributions appear to be analytic functions of @xmath1 .",
    "this means that , the more coefficients we know , the larger the interval where the truncated series gives a good approximation of the spacing functions .",
    "secondly , the higher level spacing distributions have leading terms of increasing power in @xmath1 , so in order to at least obtain the leading terms of the higher spacing function we have to expand all function during the calculation up to that given order in @xmath1 . in our case , expanding up to order @xmath2 just suffices to gives us the leading terms of the spacing distribution of levels separated by five other levels .",
    "thirdly , although it is , in principle , possible to integrate the system of coupled differential equations numerically and to obtain `` numerically exact '' results for the spacing functions , this does require the knowledge of at least the leading terms in the expansions as we can not integrate directly from @xmath3 .",
    "finally , it turns out to be very difficult to obtain a numerically exact distribution function in this way , because the distribution functions arise as differences between functions that grow exponentially with @xmath1 , and thus requires high precision numerics .",
    "in fact , the author was not able to integrate numerically the set of equations for the spacing functions with four or five intermediate levels , even though the algebraic computer package mathematica @xcite in principle allows for arbitrary precision arithmetics .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , the method used to calculate the spacing distribution is briefly summarized , following closely the discussion of ref .  @xcite .",
    "after that , the series expansion data are presented and their applicability is discussed .",
    "we end with some concluding remarks .",
    "the basic objects that usually are considered are the probabilities @xmath4 that an interval of length @xmath1 contains exactly @xmath5 eigenvalues . here",
    ", @xmath1 denotes the energy - level spacing in units of the mean level spacing .",
    "the gap probability @xmath6 that an interval of length @xmath1 contains no eigenvalue at all can be expressed as a fredholm determinant of a certain integral operator @xmath7 with a sine kernel , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "@xcite showed that this fredholm determinant can be expressed as @xmath8 where the function @xmath9 , considered as a function of the variable @xmath10 whereas @xmath11 is regarded as a parameter , is a solution of a painlev v differential equation @xmath12 \\ ;   = \\ ;   0 .",
    "\\label{eq : pv}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath11 is introduced via the boundary condition @xmath13 for @xmath14 . for the gue",
    ", @xmath15 is the generating function of the probabilities @xmath4 , thus @xmath16 where we defined @xmath17 the level - spacing distributions @xmath18 , which are the probability distributions to find two energy levels at a distance @xmath1 with @xmath5 levels lying in - between , are then obtained as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the usual nearest - neighbour spacing distribution .",
    "now , it is rather straightforward to derive series expansions for the distributions @xmath18 by making a power - series ansatz for the solution @xmath9 of the differential equation ( [ eq : pv ] ) with the appropriate boundary condition ( [ eq : ic ] ) .",
    "the distributions @xmath18 were computed with the commercial algebraic computer program mathematica @xcite .",
    "whereas it is rather easy to calculate the first few series coefficients in this way , a straightforward implementation of the equations in an algebraic programming language like mathematica will generally not succeed to calculate higher orders . in order to achieve this ,",
    "the calculation was split into smaller tasks and an iterative scheme was used , calculating the expansions coefficients one by one . in this way",
    ", it was possible to obtain the series expansions for the spacing functions @xmath18 up to order @xmath2 .",
    "small-@xmath1 expansions @xmath21 of the level - spacing distributions @xmath18 ( [ eq : pn ] ) can be obtained as follows . as a first step , we define functions @xmath22 by @xmath23 the function @xmath24 satisfies the differential equation ( [ eq : pv ] ) and behaves as @xmath25 for small @xmath10 .",
    "this follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ic ] ) , which also determines the small-@xmath10 behavior of @xmath22 for @xmath26 , @xmath27 for any @xmath28 , the functions @xmath22 , @xmath29 satisfy a coupled set of differential equations that are obtained by taking the derivative of the original painlev equation ( [ eq : pv ] ) with respect to @xmath11 and putting @xmath30 . for instance , for @xmath31 the set of differential equations becomes @xmath32 in order to obtain series expansions for the level - spacing distributions @xmath18 ( [ eq : pn ] ) with @xmath29 , we first compute series expansions for the functions @xmath22 for @xmath29 .",
    "this is done by inserting polynomials @xmath33 of order @xmath7 into the set of differential equations obtained from ( [ eq : pv ] ) , and implementing the initial conditions ( [ eq : ic0])([eq : icn ] ) by setting @xmath34 for @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the initial conditions ( [ eq : ic0 ] ) and ( [ eq : ic1 ] ) motivate the convenient choice of the expansion variable @xmath39 rather than @xmath10 .    from the expansions of the functions @xmath22 , @xmath29",
    ", we can derive expansions for @xmath40 with @xmath29 by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) , ( [ eq : d0 ] ) , and ( [ eq : dn ] ) . for example",
    ", we have @xmath41,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    .numerical values of expansion coefficients ( [ eq : ps ] ) of the level - spacing distributions @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47.[tab1 ] [ cols= \" > , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < \" , ]     and so forth .",
    "finally , this translates into an expansion for the level - spacing distributions @xmath18 via eqs .",
    "( [ eq : en ] ) and ( [ eq : pn ] ) .    as eq .",
    "( [ eq : pn ] ) involves two derivatives with respect to the variable @xmath1 , we need to obtain the expansions of the functions @xmath22 to two additional orders in @xmath10 ; so in order to achieve a result for @xmath18 that is correct to order @xmath0 in @xmath1 we have to compute the expansions of @xmath22 to order @xmath48 in @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , we need to expand the exponential function in @xmath49 ( [ eq : d0exp ] ) , whereas the integration on @xmath10 is trivially performed on polynomials . as a result ,",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath50 ( [ eq : ps ] ) are expressions involving rather lengthy rational numbers and powers of @xmath51 .",
    "the expansions for @xmath18 with @xmath52 are given in appendix  [ app1 ] ; for higher @xmath53 the lowest order in the small-@xmath1 expansion of @xmath18 is larger than @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical values of the expansion coefficients are given in table  [ tab1 ] , compare also the numerical values of the coefficients @xmath54 for @xmath55 given in ref .",
    "* table  4.1 ) .",
    "the modulus of the coefficients @xmath50 appears to decrease relatively rapidly with increasing order @xmath56 , so we may expect the series to converge on a rather large domain around the origin .",
    "to give an account of the accuracy of the expansions , we compare them to the result of a numerical integration of the coupled set of differential equations ( [ eq : pv0])([eq : pv2 ] ) derived from the original painlev equation ( [ eq : pv ] ) .",
    "these are also obtained using mathematica @xcite . in practice",
    ", we use initial values for the functions @xmath22 for small , but non - zero @xmath10 which are obtained from their expansions , and then integrate the system to larger values of @xmath10 .",
    "[ fig : p0 ]     [ fig : p1 ]    in fact , it turns out that this is not as easily done as stated .",
    "the reason is that some of the functions involved become very small or very large as @xmath1 is increased , and the computation of @xmath18 essentially involves the cancellation of these large terms . in particular , the functions @xmath22 behave asymptotically like @xcite @xmath57 for large argument @xmath10 .",
    "so , for @xmath26 , @xmath22 grows exponentially with @xmath10 , whereas @xmath18 is at most of order one , and eventually decreases as @xmath58 for large @xmath1 , see appendix  [ app2 ] where the asymptotic behavior of the functions @xmath18 for large spacings @xmath1 is discussed .",
    "[ fig : p2 ]    results for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : p0 ] , [ fig : p1 ] amd [ fig : p2 ] , respectively . apparently , the numerical solutions agree well with the series expansions of appendix  [ app1 ] up to about @xmath62 . for @xmath59 , the distribution function",
    "is well reproduced by the asymptotic form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p0dys ] ) down to @xmath63 . similarly , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : p1 ] and [ fig : p2 ] , the small-@xmath1 expansions of eqs .",
    "[ eq : pu1 ] and [ eq : pu2 ] describe the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath62 .",
    "the asymptotic forms of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : enbtw])([eq : pnas ] ) reproduce the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 very well for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . in principle , it should be possible to extend the @xmath68 expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : enbtw ] ) as well , at least for fixed values of @xmath5 , and thus improve the situation considerably .",
    "we presented series expansions for the spacing distributions @xmath18 of the gue .",
    "the expansion was calculated up to order @xmath0 in the spacing @xmath1 , and for all distributions @xmath18 . in practice",
    ", this means that for @xmath52 the leading terms up to order @xmath2 were obtained , whereas for @xmath53 the leading order is larger .",
    "the expansions agree with the complete series solutions obtained by mehta @xcite , which were derived in a different way .",
    "the explicit expansions give a very precise account of the small - spacing part of the spacing distributions , and might prove useful for comparisons with experimental or numerical data . the leading asymptotic behavior for large spacing",
    "was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by similar means .    within the same framework ,",
    "albeit slightly more involved , one can derive analogous series expansions for the spacing distributions of the goe and the gse .",
    "it is conceivable that other forms of expansions of the level spacing distributions @xmath18 for small @xmath1 might improve the convergence .",
    "a candidate might be to start from a wigner surmise type form as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
