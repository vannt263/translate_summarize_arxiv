    "the problem of the formation and evolution of clusters of galaxies has been one of the crucial topics of the last years ( see _ e.g. _ ryden & gunn 1987 , colafrancesco et al .",
    "1989 , antonuccio - delogu 1992 , kaiser 1993 , colafrancesco & vittorio 1993 , croft & efstathiou 1994 , dutta & spergel 1994 , mosconi et al .",
    "1994 , sutherland & dalton 1994 , efstathiou 1994 and colafrancesco et al .",
    "it is well known that the formation of cosmic structures is strictly related to the evolution of the density perturbations : in the present _ paradigm _ of structure formation , it is generally assumed that cosmic structures of size @xmath3 r form preferentially around the local maxima of the primordial density field , once it is smoothed on the filtering scale @xmath4 .",
    "these linear density fluctuations eventually evolve towards the nonlinear regime under the action of gravitational instability ; they detach from the hubble flow at _ turn around _",
    "epoch @xmath5 , given by : @xmath6^{1/2 } ( 1+z)^{3/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the mean background density , @xmath8 is the redshift and @xmath9 is the mean overdensity within the nonlinear region . after the _",
    "turn around _ epoch , the fluctuations start to recollapse when their overdensity defined by @xmath10 reaches the value @xmath11 .",
    "+ the evolution of the density fluctuations is described by the power spectrum , given by : @xmath12 with : @xmath13    since the density field depends on the power spectrum , which in turn depends on the matter that dominates the universe , the mean characteristics of the cosmic structures depend on the assumed model . in this context",
    "the most successful model is the biased cold dark matter ( hereafter cdm ) ( see _ e.g. _ kolb @xmath14 turner 1990 ; peebles 1993 ; liddle @xmath15 lyth 1993 ) based on a scale invariant spectrum of density fluctuations growing under gravitational instability . in such scenario the formation of the structures occurs through a `` _ bottom up _ '' mechanism .",
    "a simple model that describes the collapse of adensity perturbation is that by gunn & gott ( 1972 , hereafter gg72 ) .",
    "the main assumptions of this model are : * ( a ) * the symmetry of the collapse is spherical ; * ( b ) * the matter distribution is uniform in that region of space where the density exceeds the background density ; * ( c ) * no tidal interaction exists with the external density perturbations and * ( d ) * there is no substructure ( collapsed objects having sizes less than that of main perturbation ) .",
    "point * ( d ) * is in contradiction to the predictions of cdm models .",
    "it is well known that in a cdm universe , an abundant production of substructures during the evolution of the fluctuations is predicted .",
    "the problem of the substructures in a cdm universe and his consequences on structure formation have been widely studied in previous papers ( see _ e.g. _ antonuccio - delogu 1992 , hereafter a92 ; antonuccio - delogu & atrio - barandela 1992 , hereafter aa92 ; antonuccio - delogu & colafrancesco 1994 , hereafter ac94 , del popolo et al .",
    "1996 , gambera 1997 and del popolo & gambera 1997 hereafter dg97 ) .",
    "being a rather recent topic in cosmology much work has still to be done .",
    "+ the presence of substructure is very important for the dynamics of collapsing shells of baryonic matter made of galaxies and substructure of @xmath16 , falling into the central regions of a cluster of galaxies .",
    "as shown by chandrasekhar & von neumann ( 1942 , hereafter cvn42 ; 1943 ) , in the presence of substructure it is necessary to modify the equation of motion : @xmath17 since the graininess of mass distribution in the system induces dynamical friction that introduces a frictional force term .",
    "+ adopting the notation of gg72 ( see also their eqs . 6 and 8) and remembering that @xmath18 is the collapse time of a shell of baryonic matter in the absence of dynamical friction ( gg72 ) , one can write : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the critical density at a time @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the _ average density _",
    "inside @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "the equation of motion of a shell of baryonic matter in presence of dynamical friction ( kandrup 1980 , hereafter k80 ; kashlinsky 1986 and ac94 ) , using the dimensionless time variable @xmath25 , can be written in the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the overdensity within @xmath23 , @xmath28 is the coefficient of dynamical friction and @xmath29 is the expansion parameter of the shell ( see gg72 eq .",
    "6 ) , that can be written as : @xmath30 supposing that there is no correlation among random force and their derivatives , we have : @xmath31 ( k80 ) , where @xmath32 is the average _ `` duration '' _ of a random force impulse of magnitude @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the probability distribution of stochastic force ( which for a clustered system is given in eq .",
    "37 of aa92 ) .",
    "+ dg97 solved eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) numerically , showing qualitatively how the expansion parameter @xmath35 depends on the dynamical friction coefficient and how @xmath36 changes in the presence of dynamical friction , but without undertaking a more complete study of the dependence on the parameters .",
    "+ the plan of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we show how @xmath37 depends on the peaks height @xmath38 , on the parameter @xmath39 that we define there as the correlation function at the origin multiplied by the total number of peaks inside a protocluster , on the filtering radius @xmath4 and on the nucleus radius of the protocluster @xmath40 .",
    "a more detailed description of these parameters is given below . in sect .",
    "3 we give an analytical relation between the dynamical friction coefficient and the collapse time : @xmath41 in sect .",
    "4 we give a semi - analytical relation that links the dynamical friction coefficient with the parameters on which it depends : @xmath42 linking these two relations we also find the dependence of the dimensionless collapse time @xmath37 on the parameters used : @xmath43\\ ] ] in sect .",
    "5 we give a semi - analytical relation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 and @xmath1 : @xmath44 finally , in sect .",
    "6 we summarize our results and comment on their possible implications .",
    "dg97 showed how the expansion parameter @xmath35 depends on the dynamical friction , solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) by means of a numerical method but not taking into account the parameters on which @xmath28 depends .",
    "+ here we examine how the dynamical friction coefficient @xmath28 varies according to the parameters and how the collapse time depends on them .",
    "we consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) and the functions @xmath32 and @xmath34 , the former given by chandrasekhar ( 1943 ) , the latter ( for clustered system ) given by the so - called holtsmark law ( holtsmark 1919 ) : + @xmath45    \\nonumber \\\\    & = & 4 \\pi \\left| { \\bf f } \\right| w \\left ( \\left| { \\bf f } \\right| \\right )   \\label{eq : r } \\\\",

    "+ according to k80 : @xmath51 with : @xmath52 the original expression for @xmath53 given by k80 has been modified by aa92 to take into account clustering , and turns out to be given by : @xmath54 \\right\\ } \\right ]   \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given in aa92 respectively by the eqs .",
    "( 21 ) , ( 29 ) , ( 31 ) , ( 32 ) and ( 36 ) .",
    "+ here , we want to remind that @xmath59 is a linear function of the correlation function @xmath60 and that the general expression for @xmath59 , adopting the notation of aa92 is given by : + @xmath61    where masses are measured in units of solar mass @xmath62 and distances in @xmath63 mpc , so that @xmath64 will be measured in unit of @xmath63(mpc)@xmath65 , with @xmath66 the average mass of the substructure . since we have @xmath67 for all the cases that we consider in this paper",
    ", we can adopt the asymptotic expansion of @xmath68 demonstrated in the appendix of aa92 : @xmath69 ( see aa92 for details ) .",
    "@xmath68 does not depend on @xmath60 , but only on @xmath70 ( that is @xmath60 calculated at the origin ) .",
    "+ we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) and the other equations related for a outskirts shell of baryonic matter with @xmath71 inside the spherical regions ( protocluster ) , for different values of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 ) , the latter quantity being better defined in sect .",
    "4 . + after having determined @xmath28 solving numerically eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) , we get @xmath37 as a function of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) .",
    "we perform these calculations for different set of values of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 inside the following intervals :    @xmath77    the results that we have obtained are shown in figs . @xmath78 .    before commenting upon the figures , we want to remark that the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath79 is qualitatively shown in fig . 5 by ac94 .",
    "we observe that for @xmath80 the collapse time in the presence of a dynamical friction is always larger than in the unperturbed case but the magnitude of the deviation is negligible for larger @xmath79 , whilst for @xmath81 the deviations increase steeply with lower @xmath79 .",
    "then , having considered @xmath71 , the estimation we get for @xmath37 in sect .",
    "4 must be considered as a lower limit .",
    "1 we show the collapse time in the presence of dynamical friction , versus the peaks height , for different values of @xmath75 . in this picture , we show how @xmath37 grows for larger values of @xmath72 and for larger values of @xmath75 .",
    "similarly , in fig .",
    "2 we note how @xmath37 increases for larger values of @xmath72 and of @xmath82 .    the slope of the curves confirm our prevision on the behaviour of the collapse of a shell of baryonic matter falling into the central regions of a cluster of galaxies in the presence of dynamical friction : the dynamical friction slows down the collapse ( as dg97 had already shown ) and the effect , as we are showing in figs .",
    "1 and 2 , increases as @xmath39 , @xmath73 , @xmath83 grow .",
    "+ here we want to remind that we are considering only the peaks of the local density field with central height @xmath84 larger than a critical threshold @xmath72 .",
    "this latter quantity is chosen to be the threshold at which @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath85 is the typical size of the peaks and @xmath88 is the average peak separation ( see also bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) . +    in figs . 3 and 4",
    "we show how the collapse time varies with the nucleus radius of the protocluster @xmath89 .",
    "note how @xmath37 grows as @xmath89 decreases : the smaller the nucleus of the protocluster , the larger the time of collapse in the presence of dynamical friction ; besides we show how this effect increases for larger values of both @xmath72 and @xmath75 .",
    "like dg97 , we have solved eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) numerically and calculated the collapse time @xmath37 for different values of the dynamical friction coefficent @xmath28 .",
    "however , dg97 showed the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath28 qualitatively , whilst we have found also an analytic relation @xmath90 that links @xmath37 with @xmath28 in the range of values @xmath91 ( see also gambera 1997 ) .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in fig . 5 , where we report the collapse time @xmath37 versus the dynamical friction coefficient .",
    "we have determined the function @xmath92 through a least squares fit method .",
    "our best solution is given by : @xmath93 with : @xmath94 eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) and our results for @xmath95 from the numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) are in excellent agreement . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the correlation coefficient value obtained is : @xmath96 .",
    "as already shown by ac94 , it is possible to write down the dynamical friction coefficient @xmath1 as the sum of two terms : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the coefficient of dynamical friction of an unclustered distribution of field particles whilst @xmath99 takes into account the effect of clustering .",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : asa ] ) as : @xmath100 where , as demonstrated by a92 , the ratio @xmath101 depends only on @xmath75 and @xmath89 whilst @xmath102 is given by a92 : @xmath103^{1/2 } } { { \\langle n \\rangle_{av } r_{cl}^3 } }   \\log ( 1.36 \\langle n \\rangle_{av}^{2/3 }   r_{cl}^2 \\pi^{2/3})\\frac{1}{a^{3/2 } } \\label{eq : asc}\\ ] ] and , for a fixed value of @xmath9 , depends only on @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in the previous formula , @xmath106 is defined in bower ( 1991 ) , whilst @xmath107 and @xmath108 are defined in ac94 .",
    "therefore , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : asb ] ) as : @xmath109 where the parameters on which @xmath1 depends are the following :    * @xmath110 is the peaks height ; * @xmath111 is the filtering radius ; * @xmath112 is the parameter of the power - law density profile .",
    "a theoretical work ( ryden 1988 ) suggests that the density profile inside a protogalactic dark matter halo , before relaxation and baryonic infall , can be approximated by a power - law : @xmath113 where @xmath114 on a protogalactic scale .",
    "* @xmath115 is the product @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the total number of peaks inside a protocluster and @xmath118 is the correlation function calculated in @xmath119 . aa92",
    "have demonstrated that in the hypothesis @xmath120 , where @xmath66 is the average mass of the subpeaks , the dependence of the dynamical friction coefficient on @xmath117 and @xmath121 may be expressed as a dependence on a single parameter that we define as : @xmath122    the analytic relation @xmath123 , that links the dynamical friction coefficient with the parameters on which it depends , can be rewritten as the product of two functions : @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 with a least square method , we find the best function @xmath127 .",
    "first , we find an analytical relation between the dynamical friction coefficient in the absence of clustering @xmath98 and the parameters @xmath105 and @xmath128 .",
    "we obtain : @xmath129 with : @xmath130 we perform a @xmath131 test between the values of @xmath98 obtained from the last equation and the values of @xmath98 calculated integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : asc ] ) .",

    "+ we do the same job for the quantity @xmath134 , finding : @xmath135 with : @xmath136 an analogue @xmath131 test gives @xmath133 for the range @xmath137 .",
    "+ the function @xmath138 is given by the product of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : asg ] ) and ( [ eq : ash ] ) .",
    "these contain @xmath139 terms .",
    "@xmath140 however , we have also found an empirical formula with only @xmath141 terms that represents a good approximation .",
    "we performed a @xmath131 test between the results obtained from the @xmath142-term equation and the results obtained from the numerical integration .",
    "the result is @xmath143 .",
    "the same test performed on the @xmath144-term equation gives @xmath145 .",
    "our @xmath142-term equation reads as : @xmath146 with : @xmath147 the function @xmath148 is given by : @xmath149 ^ 2   +   a_2 \\left [    f_2(\\nu , r_f , r_0,\\xi )   \\right ] + a_3    \\label{eq : asn}\\ ] ] that is : @xmath150 ^ 2    + a_2 \\left [ \\eta_0 \\left ( 1 + \\frac{\\eta_{cl}}{\\eta_0 }",

    "our aim is to find a semi - analytical relation @xmath153 for the intervals @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",

    "we find @xmath156 for several values of @xmath1 inside the interval @xmath155 .",

    "( [ eq : p ] ) gives the result : @xmath168 .",
    "in sect . 2 of this work we showed in a quantitative way how the collapse time @xmath37 of a shell of baryonic matter made of galaxies and substructure depends on some parameters .",
    "when one of the parameters @xmath75 or @xmath82 or @xmath169 increases , the collapse time grows .",
    "it means that the effects of the presence of dynamical friction should be more evident in the outer regions of rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "besides , we show how the collapse time of an infalling shell increases with decreasing values of @xmath89 , and becomes very large for @xmath170 mpc ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . as a consequence , the slowing down of the collapse of an outer shell within a cluster of galaxies owing to the dynamical friction is more remarkable in the clusters with nucleus of little dimension . +   in sect . 3 of this paper we give an analytic relation that links the dimensionless collapse time @xmath37 with the coefficient of dynamical friction @xmath28 .",
    "this relation is in excellent agreement with the numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) for @xmath91 ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "then , we find an analytic relation between @xmath28 and the parameters on which it depends for the value @xmath171 ( we remind that the effects of the dynamical friction are negligible for @xmath172 ) .",
    "this is eq .",
    "( [ eq : asd ] ) , that can be considered as a _ `` low order '' _ approximation to a more realistic situation of an outer shell of a cluster of galaxies with @xmath173 .",
    "we also find an empirical formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : asm ] ) , that is a good approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : asmm ] ) .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the dimensionless collapse time on @xmath169 , @xmath174 , @xmath75 and @xmath82 is shown ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : asn ] ) ) .",
    "+ finally , we give an analytical relation that links @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 . here , we wish to stress the usefulness of an analytic relation like @xmath175 \\cdot   g ( { \\overline \\delta } ) $ ] .",
    "this is a powerful tool to estimate the effect of the dynamical friction in the outer regions of clusters of galaxies ( gambera et al . in preparation ) and to compare the observational data with the theoretical ones .",
    "this is a good method to test how important is the role of the dynamical friction in the collapse of the clusters of galaxies .",
