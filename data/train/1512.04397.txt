    "the large hierarchy between the masses of the first two and the third generation of standard model ( sm ) quarks seems to point to an intrinsic difference between the nature of these particles and suggest that the top quark plays a special role in the underlying mechanisms of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . while this problem is not addressed in the sm , various new physics ( np ) scenarios attempt to find a solution to this puzzle , with composite higgs models ( chms ) being nowadays one of the most compelling sm extension .    within this framework the higgs is assumed to be a bound state of a new strongly interacting sector with a cut - off at a scale @xmath2 , thus resolving the so - called _ big hierarchy problem _ of the sm , while the little hierarchy between the higgs mass and the cut - off scale is further ensured by the pseudo nambu goldstone boson ( pngb ) nature of the higgs . while this idea goes back to the 80s  @xcite , one modern ingredient of chms",
    "is the mechanism of _ partial compositeness _",
    "@xcite , which addresses the mass hierarchy between the sm fermions by postulating a sizable mixing of the third generation of quarks with the strong sector to which the higgs belongs .",
    "the simplest realisation of this idea is the minimal composite higgs model ( mchm )  @xcite , where the higgs arises from the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath3 , thus providing only four gbs and a custodial symmetry to prevent the @xmath4 parameter from large corrections .",
    "this idea was originally considered in the context of 5-dimensional ( 5d ) scenarios while deconstructed 4d effective descriptions were more recently proposed  @xcite .",
    "these explicit chm realisations present features of phenomenological relevance at colliders ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , as they include in their spectrum a full sector of composite resonances of the strong sector , both of spin 1 and spin 1/2 , below the cut - off @xmath5 and allow for a dynamical calculation of the higgs potential through the coleman - weinberg technique  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the 4d composite higgs model ( 4dchm ) predicts a finite one loop higgs potential that , for a natural choice of the model parameters , results in a higgs mass consistent with the atlas and cms measurements  @xcite .    in order to shed light on the possibility of np intimately correlated with the top sector ,",
    "the measurement of the top quark properties , and in particular of its couplings to the higgs and sm gauge bosons , are of primary importance . in this respect",
    "a leptonic collider will greatly increase the precision achievable the the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , due to the cleaner experimental environment with respect to a hadronic machine and the possibility of having a well defined initial state and controllable centre of mass ( com ) energy .",
    "moreover the possibility of having polarised initial state , or of measuring top quark polarisation in the final state , will be important to measure independently the @xmath6 and @xmath7 couplings , both contributing to @xmath8 production .",
    "future leptonic facilities will also be an excellent environment to measure the top quark mass , because of the colourless initial state .    in this proceeding we will show how the new particle content present in the 4dchm can affect @xmath1 production at future @xmath0 facilities in two ways .",
    "firstly , potentially large deviations of the @xmath9 coupling with respect to the sm prediction can arise due to mixing between the top quark and composite spin 1/2 resonances , the so - called top partners , and between the @xmath10 and additional composite spin 1 resonances , hereafter referred to as @xmath4 .",
    "secondly , the @xmath4s can enter as propagating particles in the diagrams describing @xmath1 production , thus contributing either on their own or via interference effect with the sm background . in order to cover different machines prototypes , as the international linear collider ( ilc )",
    ", the compact linear collider ( clic ) and the future circular collider ( fcc ) , we will work in an com energy ranging from @xmath11 up to 1 tev .",
    "many extensions of the sm predict large deviations of the @xmath10 couplings to a top quark pair . in chms",
    "these deviations are a consequence of the mixing between the right and left handed top quark components and the top partners present in the composite sector .",
    "the top quark couplings to the @xmath10 and the photon can be conveniently parametrised in terms of form factors defined by @xmath12 \\label{f}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the proton charge , @xmath14 is the top - quark mass , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the outgoing top ( antitop ) quark four - momentum and @xmath17 .",
    "the terms @xmath18 in the low energy limit are the @xmath19 vector and axial - vector form - factors , which can be easily translated into left and right - handed top quark couplings to the @xmath10 boson . while the lhc sensitivity to these quantities is quite limited , future @xmath0 facilities will improve the accuracy of these measurements of at least one order of magnitude , depending on the machine prototype details , the com energy , the luminosity , the selected final state and the possibility of using polarised beams .",
    "this is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ttz - coup ] , where the expected sensitivity in determining the form factors is illustrated for various collider prototypes . also reported in the right panel of the same figure are the typical deviations for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 couplings for various new physics scenarios and the 4dchm , the latter represented as black dots .",
    "these figures make therefore clear the importance of @xmath0 machines also in comparison to the high luminosity lhc options , at the end of which the 4dchm might not be disentangled from the sm .",

    "electroweak ( ew ) precision data and current lhc measurements bound top partners and @xmath4 resonances to have a mass above @xmath26 800 gev and 2 tev respectively .",
    "while top partners only affect @xmath1 production via modifications of the @xmath9 coupling , @xmath4 resonances can directly enter into the diagrams describing the @xmath0 process both for the inclusive cross section as well as for asymmetry observables  @xcite .",
    "this is well illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_afb_500 ] , where we present deviations from the sm predictions for the total cross section and for the forward backward asymmetry ( afb )   with @xmath27 the polar angle in the @xmath28 rest frame and @xmath29 denoting the number of observed events in a given hemisphere ] without ( left panel ) or with ( right panel ) the inclusions of the @xmath4s present in the 4dchm as propagating particles in the production diagrams for @xmath30  gev .",
    "the blue points are compliant with current ew precision data and lhc measurements , and clearly illustrate the importance of @xmath4 exchange even at a com energy well below the @xmath4s mass scale of @xmath26 2 tev , due to their interference effect with the sm background .     with @xmath31 500 gev without ( left ) and with ( right ) the inclusion of the @xmath4s present in the 4dchm as propagating particles in the production diagrams .",

    "blue points are compliant with current ew precision data and lhc measurements.__,title=\"fig : \" ]    we can then extract the sensitivity of an @xmath0 prototype to the relevant parameters of a typical chm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : colour_xi ] we plot , by using different colours , the predicted deviations for the cross section at @xmath32= 500 and 1000 gev in the 4dchm compared with the sm as functions of @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the typical coupling strength of the @xmath4 resonances , and @xmath35 , the compositeness parameter .",
    "for each point we have selected the configuration yielding the maximal deviation defined as @xmath36 .",
    "the points correspond to @xmath37@xmath38 tev , @xmath39@xmath40 and are obtained scanning over the other model parameters .",
    "we see that , by requiring a deviation larger than 2% to be detected , a 500 gev machine is sensitive to @xmath4 resonances with mass up to 3.5  tev .     at 500 and 1000",

    "in this proceeding , based on ref .",
    "@xcite , we have exploited a calculable version of a chm in order to test the sensitivity of future @xmath0 colliders to deviations in the cross section and fb asymmetry of @xmath1 production from the sm values .",
    "we have illustrated how these observables can be affected by both deviations in the @xmath43 couplings and by the presence of spin-1 resonances .",
    "the latter in particular can lead to sizable deviations also at com energies well below their mass scale , due to interference effects with the sm background .",
    "we have then finally mapped such predicted deviations into typical parameter of chms , namely the mass scale of the spin-1 resonances , @xmath44 , and the compositeness parameter , @xmath35 .",
