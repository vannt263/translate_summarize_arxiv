    "with the expansion of the internet services , people are becoming increasingly dependent on the internet with an information overload .",
    "consequently , how to efficiently help people find information that they truly need is a challenging task nowadays @xcite .",
    "being an effective tool to address this problem , the recommender system has caught increasing attention and become an essential issue in internet applications such as e - commerce system and digital library system @xcite .",
    "motivated by the practical significance to the e - commerce and society , the design of an efficient recommendation algorithm becomes a joint focus from engineering science to mathematical and physical community .",
    "various kinds of algorithms have been proposed , such as correlation - based methods @xcite , content - based methods @xcite , spectral analysis @xcite , iteratively self - consistent refinement @xcite , principle component analysis @xcite , network - based methods @xcite , and so on . for a review of current progress ,",
    "see ref . @xcite and the references therein .",
    "one of the most successful recommendation algorithms , called _ collaborative filtering _ ( cf ) , has been developed and extensively investigated over the past decade @xcite .",
    "when predicting the potential interests of a given user , such approach firstly identifies a set of similar users from the past records and then makes a prediction based on the weighted combination of those similar users opinions . despite its wide applications , collaborative filtering suffers from several major limitations including system scalability and accuracy @xcite",
    "recently , some physical dynamics , including mass diffusion ( md ) @xcite and heat conduction ( hc ) @xcite , have found their applications in personalized recommendations . based on md and hc ,",
    "several effective network - based recommendation algorithms have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these algorithms have been demonstrated to be of both high accuracy and low computational complexity .",
    "however , the algorithmic accuracy and computational complexity may be very sensitive to the statistics of data sets .",
    "for example , the algorithm presented in ref .",
    "@xcite runs much faster than the standard cf if the number of users is much larger than that of objects , while when the number of objects is huge , the advantage of this algorithm vanishes because its complexity is mainly determined by the number of objects ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "since the cf algorithm has been extensively applied in the real e - commerce systems @xcite , it s meaningful to find some ways to increase the algorithmic accuracy of cf .",
    "we therefore present a modified collaborative filtering ( mcf ) method , in which the user correlation is defined based on the diffusion process .",
    "recently , liu _",
    "@xcite studied the user and object degree correlation effect to cf , they found that the algorithm accuracy could be remarkably improved by adjusting the user and object degree correlation . in this paper , we argue that the high - order correlations should be taken into account to depress the influence of mainstream preferences and the accuracy could be improved in this way .",
    "the correlation between two users is , in principle , an integration of many underlying similar tastes .",
    "for two arbitrary users , the very specific yet common tastes shall contribute more to the similarity measure than those mainstream tastes .",
    "figure 1 shows an illustration of how to find the specific tastes by eliminating the mainstream preference . to the users @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the commonly selected objects",
    "1 and 2 could reflect their tastes , where 1 denotes the mainstream preference shared by all @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and 2 is the specific taste of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "both 1 and 2 contribute to the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "since 1 is the mainstream preference , it also contributes to the correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath3 , as well as @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "tracking the path @xmath4 , the mainstream preference 1 could be identified by considering the second - order correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "statistically speaking , two users sharing many mainstream preferences should have high second - order correlation , therefore we can depress the influence of mainstream preferences by taking into account the second - order correlation .",
    "the numerical results show that the algorithm involving high - order correlations is much more accurate and provides more diverse recommendations .",
    "[ 0.5 ] , @xmath3 and @xmath2 are correlated because they have collected some common objects , where object @xmath5 has been collected by all of the three users , while object 2 is only collected by user @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "denote the object set as @xmath6 and the user set as @xmath7 = @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 , a recommender system can be fully described by an adjacent matrix @xmath11 , where @xmath12 if @xmath13 is collected by @xmath14 , and @xmath15 otherwise . for a given user , a recommendation algorithm generates an ordered list of all the objects he / she has not collected before .    to test the recommendation algorithmic accuracy",
    ", we divide the data set into two parts : one is the training set used as known information for prediction , and the other one is the probe set , whose information is not allowed to be used .",
    "many metrics have been proposed to judge the algorithmic accuracy , including _ precision _",
    "@xcite , _ recall _ @xcite , _ f - measure _",
    "@xcite , _ average ranking score _",
    "@xcite , and so on .",
    "since the average ranking score does not depend on the length of recommendation list , we adopt it in this paper .",
    "indeed , a recommendation algorithm should provide each user with an ordered list of all his / her uncollected objects .",
    "for an arbitrary user @xmath16 , if the entry @xmath16-@xmath17 is in the probe set ( according to the training set , @xmath17 is an uncollected object for @xmath16 ) , we measure the position of @xmath17 in the ordered list .",
    "for example , if there are @xmath18 uncollected objects for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the 10th from the top , we say the position of @xmath17 is @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "since the probe entries are actually collected by users , a good algorithm is expected to give high recommendations , leading to small @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the mean value of the position @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( called _ average ranking score _",
    "@xcite ) , averaged over all the entries in the probe , can be used to evaluate the algorithmic accuracy : the smaller the ranking score , the higher the algorithmic accuracy , and vice verse . for a null model with randomly generated recommendations ,",
    "@xmath23 .",
    "besides accuracy , the average degree of all recommended objects , @xmath24 , and the mean value of hamming distance , @xmath25 , are taken into account to measure the algorithmic popularity and diversity @xcite . the smaller average degree ,",
    "corresponding to the less popular objects , are preferred since those lower - degree objects are hard to be found by users themselves .",
    "in addition , the personal recommendation algorithm should present different recommendations to different users according to their tastes and habits .",
    "the diversity can be quantified by the average hamming distance , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the length of recommendation list , and @xmath29 is the overlapped number of objects in @xmath16 s and @xmath14 s recommendation lists .",
    "the higher @xmath25 indicates a more diverse and thus more personalized recommendations .",
    "in the standard cf , the correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath14 can be evaluated directly by the well - known cosine similarity index @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the degree of user @xmath16 .",
    "inspired by the diffusion process presented by zhou _",
    "@xcite , the user correlation network can be obtained by projecting the user - object bipartite network .",
    "how to determine the edge weight is the key issue in this process .",
    "we assume a certain amount of resource ( e.g. , recommendation power ) is associated with each user , and the weight @xmath32 represents the proportion of the resource @xmath14 would like to distribute to @xmath16 .",
    "this process could be implemented by applying the network - based resource - allocation process @xcite on a user - object bipartite network where each user distributes his / her initial resource equally to all the objects he / she has collected , and then each object sends back what it has received to all the users who collected it , the weight @xmath32 ( the fraction of initial resource @xmath14 eventually gives to @xmath16 ) can be expressed as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the degree of object @xmath35 . for the user - object pair @xmath36 ,",
    "if @xmath16 has not yet collected @xmath17 ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) , the predicted score , @xmath38 , is given as @xmath39 based on the definitions of @xmath32 and @xmath38 , given a target user @xmath16 , the mcf algorithm is given as following    ( i ) : :    calculating the user correlation matrix @xmath40 based    on the diffusion process , as shown in eq .",
    "( 2 ) ; ( ii ) : :    for each user @xmath16 , based on eq . ( 3 ) , calculating the    predicted scores for his / her uncollected objects ; ( iii ) : :    sorting the uncollected objects in descending order of the predicted    scores , and those objects in the top will be recommended .",
    "the standard cf and the mcf have similar process , and their only difference is that they adopt different measures of user - user correlation ( i.e. , @xmath41 for the standard cf and @xmath32 for mcf ) .    [ 0.4 ] and the improvement ( ip ) vs. the sparsity of the training sets .",
    "all the data points are averaged over ten independent runs with different data - set divisions .",
    "the results corresponding to netflix data are marked.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we use two benchmark data sets , one is _ _ movielens _ _ , which consists of 1682 movies ( objects ) and 943 users .",
    "the other one is _",
    "_ netflix _ _ , which consists of 3000 movies and 3000 users ( we use a random sample of the whole netflix dataset ) . the users vote movies by discrete ratings from one to five .",
    "here we applied a coarse - graining method @xcite : a movie is set to be collected by a user only if the giving rating is larger than 2 . in this way , the _ movielens _ data has 85250 edges , and the _ netflix _ data has 567456 edges .",
    "the data sets are randomly divided into two parts : the training set contains @xmath42 percent of the data , and the remaining @xmath43 part constitutes the probe .    implementing the standard cf and mcf",
    "when @xmath44 , the average ranking scores on _ movielens _ and _ netflix _ data are improved from from 0.1168 to 0.1038 and from 0.2323 to 0.2151 , respectively .",
    "clearly , using the simply diffusion - based simlarity , subject to the algorithmic accuracy , the mcf outperforms the standard cf . the corresponding average object degree and diversity",
    "are also improved ( see fig.[fig22 ] and fig.[fig23 ] below ) .    [ 0.4 ] , vs. @xmath45 when @xmath44 .",
    "squares , circles and triangles represent lengths @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",

    "to investigate the effect of second - order user correlation to algorithm performance , we use a linear form to investigate the effect of the second - order user correlation to mcf , where the user similarity matrix could be demonstrated as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the newly defined correlation matrix , @xmath52 is the first - order correlation defined as eq . ( 2 ) , and @xmath45 is a tunable parameter . as discussed before , we expect the algorithmic accuracy can be improved at some negative @xmath45 .    when @xmath44 , the algorithmic accuracy curves of _ movielens _ and _ netflix _ have clear minimums around @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which strongly support the above discussion .",
    "compared with the routine case ( @xmath55 ) , the average ranking scores can be further reduced to 0.0826 ( improved 20.45% ) and 0.1436 ( improved 33.25% ) at the optimal values .",
    "it is indeed a great improvement for recommendation algorithms .",
    "since the data sparsity can be turned by changing @xmath42 , we investigate the effect of the sparsity on the two data sets respectively , and find that although we test the algorithm on two different data sets , the optimal @xmath0 are strongly correlated with the sparsity in a uniform way for both _",
    "movielens _ and _ netflix_. figure [ fig24 ] shows that when the sparsity increases , @xmath0 will decrease , and the improvement of the average ranking scores will increase .",
    "these results can be treated as a good guideline for selecting optimal @xmath45 of different data sets .",
    "figure [ fig22 ] reports the average degree of all recommended objects as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] that when @xmath44 the average object degree is positively correlated with @xmath45 , thus to depress the influence of mainstream interests gives more opportunity to the less popular objects , which could bring more information to the users than the popular ones . when the list length , @xmath28 , bing equal to 20 , at the optimal point @xmath56 , the average degree is reduced by 29.3% compared with the standard cf . when @xmath44 , fig .",
    "[ fig23 ] exhibits a negative correlation between @xmath25 and @xmath45 , indicating that to consider the second - order correlations makes the recommendation lists more diverse . when @xmath49 , the diversity @xmath25 is increased from 0.592 ( corresponding to the standard cf ) to 0.880 ( corresponding to the case @xmath53 in the improved algorithm ) .",
    "figure [ fig22 ] and figure [ fig23 ] show how the parameter @xmath45 affects the average object degree @xmath24 and diversity @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "clearly , the smaller @xmath45 leads to less popularity and higher diversity , and thus the present algorithm can find its advantage in recommending novel objects with diverse topics to users , compared with the standard cf . generally speaking , the popular objects must have some attributes fitting the tastes of the masses of the people .",
    "the standard cf may repeatedly count those attributes and assign more power for the popular objects , which increases the average object degree and reduces the diversity . the present algorithm with negative @xmath45",

    "interestingly , we found even for different data sets , the optimal value of @xmath45 exhibits a uniform tendency versus sparsity . therefore , if we know the sparsity of the training set , the corresponding optimal @xmath0 could be approximately confirmed .",
    "in addition , when the sparsity gets less than 1% , the improved algorithm would nt be effective any more , while as the sparsity increases , the improvement of the presented algorithm is enlarged .    ignoring the degree - degree correlation in user - object entries ,",
