    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) emit enormous amount of energy from their central , compact region . however , it is impossible to resolve this compact region with current instruments when the agns are at cosmological distances .",
    "observation of variability for such distant objects is a useful method for investigating the emitting mechanism as well as the internal structure of the compact region .",
    "therefore , a first pathway to progress is to detect their variability in various passbands and to study the detected variability in detail . in this regard ,",
    "it is essential to measure not only the magnitude of variability but also its error as accurately as possible .    recent monitoring observation of agns by differential photometory with ccds detected variability in almost all of the agns observed in the optical bands ( borgeest & schramm 1994 , netzer et al .",
    "1996 , giveon et al .",
    "determination of near - infrared ( nir ) variability in agns , for which optical variability has already been detected , leads to a better understanding of their emission mechanisms . in the dust reverberation model",
    ", the structure of the dust torus can be investigated from the time delay of the nir variability , which lagges behind the uv / optical variability ( cravel , wamsteker & glass 1989 , barvanis 1992 ) .",
    "neugebauer et al .",
    "( 1989 ) monitored 108 optically selected quasars in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and 10@xmath11 m bands , and discussed the probability of each agn having varied .",
    "however , the number of agns with nir variability measurements of comparable accuracy to the optical study , is still too small to derive general properties of variability . therefore , it is of prime importance at this stage to obtain more data of high accuracy on nir variability .    here",
    ", in this paper , we present the new @xmath12 variability data for 226 agns . to date , this is the largest sample systematically ovserved in the nir .",
    "each agn was observed twice .",
    "efficient and highly accurate detection of variability was achieved using differential photometry .",
    "the method of error estimation and the generality of the phenomenon of variability are discussed in this paper .",
    "various relations among detected variability , absolute @xmath13-magnitude and agn redshift will be discussed in paper iii .",
    "we have been conducting a project called magnum which is an acronym for multicolor active galactic nuclei monitoring ( kobayashi et al .",
    "1998a , 1998b ) .",
    "the magnum project aims to determine the distances to many agns from measurements of the time delay between nir and uv / optical valiabilities .",
    "this paper is therefore a preliminary target selection of agns with sizable variability , which will be monitored by the magnum project .",
    "the data analyzed in this paper was obtained using the image reduction processes described in  2 of paper i. we selected 226 agns from the calalogs of quasars and active galactic nuclei ( veron - cetty and veron 1993 , 1996 , 1998 ) , which will also be used as target agns for the magnum project .",
    "their right ascensions and declinations are shown in fig.1 of paper i , and their redshifts and absolute @xmath13-magnitudes in fig.2 of paper i.    all observations were performed with the nir camera picnic ( kobayashi et al.1994 ) mounted on the @xmath14 m infrared telescope at the institute of space and astronomical science ( isas ) , japan .",
    "agns were imaged by stepping the telescope in a raster pattern .",
    "two standard stars at different altitutes were observed three times each night in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands . in usual cases ,",
    "images were reduced automatically by the software picred developed for the picnic camera and optimized for the reduction of agn and qso images .",
    "each of agns was observed on two different nights with photometric standards .",
    "however , some problems arise when one wishes to regard the difference between two measured magnitudes as variability .",
    "one of the problems arises from different the psfs for agns and the photometric standards which occur due to variation of seeing and/or telescope tracking .",
    "adopting a larger aperture alleviates this problem , but at the same time it decreases the s / n ratio of an object image .",
    "the s / n ratio increases by increasing the integration time , but longer integration time obviously decreases the number of observable objects per night .",
    "another problem arises from the different atmospheric transmissivities at the different times when the agns and the photometric standards were observed .",
    "frequent observation of photometric standards alleviates this problem , but at the same time it decreases the observational efficiency .",
    "the atmospheric transmissivity as well as the seeing conditions could vary significantly , especially when a cloud comes into the line of sight .",
    "great care was taken to avoid such interviening clouds during the observations , but some very thin clouds were identified only after daybreak .",
    "the data taken on such nights and those on non - photometric nights were excluded from the analysis , which also leads to a loss of observational efficiency .",
    "the above problems stem from magnitudes of images taken on different nights , along different lines of sight , and under different instrumental conditions such as the tracking of the telescope .",
    "unless these problems are avoided , the standards - based photometry is not an accurate method for detecting the variability of agns .      in principle , the above problems from variations of psf and transmissivity are minimized by differential photometry .",
    "therefore , we adopted a method of differential photometry in order to detect the variability of agns with high accuracy and reliability . in the ideal case",
    "such that target agns and nearby reference objects are point sources and no errors exist in flat fielding , we describe the scheme of differential photometry which is used to detect the variability of agns .",
    "we measure instrumental aperture magnitudes of both agns and reference objects on two different nights .",
    "we regard their magnitude difference as reflecting real difference of their fluxes , because the systematic errors from variations of seeing and telescope tracking are cancelled out under the assumptions that the psfs in each field are the same within the required accuracy and that variation of atmospheric transmissivity equally affects all objects in each field .",
    "we therefore regard the change of measured magnitudes from different nights for each agn as its variability .",
    "cancellation of systematic errors in the case of differential photometry justifies our use of a smaller aperture , which results in smaller statistical errors as well .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a high observational efficiency is maintained by differential photometry , because the data taken through thin clouds can also be used .",
    "there remain some systematic errors that are not suppressed even by differential photometry .",
    "imperfect of flat fielding gives rise to errors in the magnitude difference between an agn and its nearby reference objects .",
    "variation in the psf is not completely canceled if intrinsic brightness profiles are not the same .",
    "furthermore , the possible variability of the reference objects , of course , is another source of error in determination of the valiability of the agn .",
    "however , as describe below , all these errors were not fatal in our analysis , where the images of agns are not very extended and most reference objects consist of stars .      identification of agns and reference objects observed on two different nights is an important step in differential photometry .",
    "we used images from a digitized palomer chart , or equivalently , the digitized sky survey ( dss ) , as positional references .",
    "the identification of each object on three frames , such as a dss frame and two nir frames taken on different nights , is more reliable than only on two nir frames .",
    "the dss images of all agns observed in this paper were obtained with a batch script from a database at the data analysis center of the national astronomical obvervatory , japan ( naoj ) ; dds2 images are of better resolution compared to those of dss1 .",
    "we use as many dss2 images as possible , while not excluding the use of dss1 images for the purpose of completeness .",
    "the size of the extracted dss images was @xmath15 arcmin@xmath16 . that size is larger than the mosaiced nir images we obtained .",
    "objects in the dss images were automatically detected by the iraf cl script which consists of the dao find task and a perl script .",
    "after some trial - and - error tuning of the detection parameters , we found that objects are distinguished from noise more easily in the dss images than in our nir images .",
    "associating each target agn with a dss image was done manually .",
    "the target was mostly located at the center , with some exceptions where it was a little away from the center owing to positional errors .",
    "the finding charts were prepared based on the information in the vv catalog . for efficient association ,",
    "the cl script was prepared and used in such a way that the nearest object from mouse - clicked point was searched .",
    "the found object was , if close enough , regarded as the target agn , otherwise an error message of ` not found ' was given .",
    "the result of detection / non - detection of agns and nearby reference objects were written in a text file within other additional information .",
    "objects in the nir images were automatically detected using the cl script similarly to the case for the dss images .",
    "luminosity of our agns is distributed over a wide range , so that a large number of noise images were detected when the threshold was set low enough to detect faint agns . in such a case , many false detections emerge near the faint end of the detected object distribution . an appropriate level of faint object detections was estimated and the faint object distribution was automatically smoothed with the iraf task for image replacement . by this operation , false detections were greatly decreased , though not completely excluded .",
    "together with nearby reference objects , most agns were detected in the automatic detection scheme , while some of faint agns required manual trial - and - error tuning of the detection parameters .",
    "however , invisible agns , or very faint agns that were not detected by any manual method were regarded as non - detections .",
    "the most central object was not always the target agn in the nir images , partly because the tuning of the telescope pointing was not done for some time .",
    "furthermore , since the fourth quadarant of the detector was out of order in the second of the two observation perios , an off - center region of the detector was used to detect the agns in the second periods .",
    "therefore it was necessary to identify and mark the target agns manually using the finding charts .",
    "it was necessary to identify reference objects automatically , because their number exceeds that of agns by about an order of magnitude and is beyond ability of manual operation .",
    "the dss and nir images were listed downwards from the top , and arranged according to their coordinates from north to south .",
    "the coordinates of detected objects or agns in such images were then transformed to the new coordinates in units of arcsec , placing each agn at the origin .",
    "identification between the dss and infrared images was performed by a usual least - squares fitting with two free parameters of rotation and expansion of the images . at the first step of the fitting , reference objects in the nir images and those in the dss images , if within a seperation of 10 arcsec",
    ", were regarded as the same objects .",
    "the fitting was iterated with a smaller aperture using new starting parameters which were obtained as the result of the last iteration .",
    "the lower limit for decreasing the aperture was set to be 2 arcsec , which is comparable to a typical fwhm for a point source in the nir images .",
    "the final value of rotation parameter was less than a few degrees , and that of the expansion factor was about @xmath17 for most cases .",
    "the automatic fitting was almost always successful , and the script produced from the last iteration was useful .",
    "for some cases where only very faint objects were detected in the images , the iteration did not show a tendency of convergence , so that manual operation was needed to tune the parameters .",
    "however , if even manual identification , the data were not used in our analysis .",
    "only the pairs of dss and nir objects , identified through the above fitting procedure , were regarded as the same objects .      in order to derive the variability of agns from the difference between their magnitudes observed on different nights ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the fiducial which should be subtracted from such difference .",
    "let @xmath18 be the difference between the instrumental magnitudes of the @xmath19-th reference object observed on two different nights , and @xmath20 its measurement errors , where @xmath19 runs from 1 to @xmath21 .",
    "the subscript 1 or 2 refers to the first or second measurement of the two observations , respectively .",
    "the distribution of @xmath22 is broader than expected from @xmath23 .",
    "this broadening likely stems from an error in the flat fielding which would equally affect all reference objects regardless of their luminosity .",
    "we incorporate this extra error @xmath24 in the estimation of the total error , so that the distribution of @xmath22 conforms to @xmath25 distribution .",
    "the value of @xmath24 is then obtained from solving the following equation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a weighted average given by @xmath28 where we set @xmath29 if no real value exists .",
    "substitution of the value of @xmath24 into equation 2 gives the value of @xmath27 which should be used as a fiducial in deriving the variability of agns .",
    "the uncertainty of this fiducial is estimated as @xmath30 the variability of agn is therefore given by @xmath31 and its error by @xmath32    the process of determining the fiducial @xmath27 is iterated , by excluding abnormal reference objects beyond a deviation of 5@xmath33 deviation .",
    "three iterations suffice to exclude all such abnormal objects which are mostly either misidentifications , or near the edge of frame , or intrinsicly variable stars .",
    "after convergence at @xmath34 , the iterative rejection is repeated at @xmath7 .",
    "an example of differential photometry is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the difference @xmath35 for mark 1320 in the @xmath1 band is plotted at @xmath36 , together with @xmath22 for five reference objects from @xmath37 to 5 .",
    "it is evident that the fiducial @xmath27 ( dashed horizontal line ) yields @xmath38 mag , that is , mark 1320 was brightened by 0.55 mag .      the determined variability , @xmath39 , of agns by differential photometry is less sensitive to psf variation as compared to that by standards - based photometry . in principle ,",
    "the effect of psf variation on differential photometry is canceled out , if the psfs of target and reference objects are of the same shape . however , since the target agns have more extended profiles than reference objects that are mostly stars , the effect of psf variation is not completely canceled out .",
    "the variability of agns , corrected for the effect of psf variation , is therefore given by @xmath40 and its error by @xmath41    we characterize the psfs of the reference objects by their fwhms measured with the cl script in the iraf imexamine task .",
    "there is a tendency for the fwhms from the iraf output to be larger for fainter objects . in order to avoid this tendency ,",
    "we use only the reference objects for which photon counts at their profile center exceed 50 .",
    "we estimate the difference @xmath42 for the @xmath19-th reference object around the target agn , where the subscript 1 or 2 refers to the first or second measurement from the two observations , respectively .",
    "we then derive the correction @xmath43 due to an intrinsic nonzero @xmath44 , by convolving the smaller - fwhm@xmath45 image to match the larger - fwhm@xmath45 image .",
    "this analysis was performed using the iraf gaus task , and the correction @xmath43 is derived as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "taking an average over all the reference objects around the target agn , we obtain @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which will be used to correct @xmath39 for the effect of a nonzero intrinsic psf .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "2 shows the correction @xmath46 plotted against @xmath47 , based on the data for which the accuracy of instrumental magnitude is better than 0.02 mag .",
    "it is clear that the better ( poorer ) seeing in the later of two observations gives fake darkening ( brightening ) in @xmath39 .",
    "the plots in this panel are fitted by a linear relation between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the dispersion around @xmath46 is expressed , in terms of @xmath47 , as @xmath48 the bottom panel shows the frequency distribution of @xmath46 . since the data are restricted to brighter agns of high accuracy , we can not individually correct the variability of agns in our sample . with this restriction , we rather estimate @xmath49 and @xmath50 from the combined @xmath12 data and substitute these values in equations 6 and 7 , irrespective of the passband .    here , the estimate of @xmath46 has been limited to bright agns only . however , contrary to the case of bright agns , the fake variability due to psf variation would be even smaller for fainter agns , because only the central , point - like part of their profiles is visible with their extended hosts mostly below detection .",
    "therefore , the estimate of @xmath49 from bright agns is also used to correct the variability of fainter agns in this paper .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this paper is a preliminary study for a monitoring program , magnum , which is expected to go fainter ( @xmath51mag ) and more accurately ( @xmath52mag ) , compared with our observations here .",
    "in such a program , the correction factor for each of agns is obtained as a function of varying luminosity and psf in the course of lon - term monitoring observations , and the method of convolving obtained images , as used here , may not be necessary .",
    "error estimation in the variability data is very important .",
    "when the error is sufficiently small , a fake variability originates from only the dispersion of the photometric data . on the other hand ,",
    "when the error is too large , the significance of any detected variability can not be certain .",
    "the variability of reference objects was fairly small , because most of them are stars .",
    "their corrected variability is denoted by @xmath53 , and the corrected error is calculated by @xmath54 .",
    "we divide the reference objects into subsamples according to their calculated errors binned at intervals of 0.01 . for the subsample in each error bin",
    ", we have constructed the frequency distribution of corrected variability , and derived the median @xmath55 and dispersion @xmath56 for a sample in each error bin centered at @xmath57 .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath55 and @xmath56 plotted against @xmath57 in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands .",
    "it is seen from this figure that the @xmath57 s are nearly equal to the @xmath56 s , but are mostly below the dotted line of @xmath58 .",
    "this indicates a slight overestimation of @xmath57 , which is desirable rather than the converse , so that our error estimation of differential photometry is quantitatively reliable over a range of error from 0.01 up to 0.1 for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "the medians , @xmath55 s , are almost equal to zero .      in this paper",
    "we have used a method of differential photometry to detect the nir variability of agns . on the other hand , however , we can also use a method of standards - based photometry to detect agn variability in our sample . in this section",
    "we compare the accuracies of these two methods when applied to the same agns .",
    "the differential photometry uses the instrumental , aperture magnitudes with a fixed aperture of @xmath59 pixels , while the standards - based photometry uses aperture magnitudes with @xmath60 and 15 pixels . by standards",
    "- based photometry we obtained a pair of magnitude and measurement error for each object observed on two different nights , and determined the magnitude difference @xmath61 and its error @xmath62 .",
    "the analysis below is limited to the data for which more than two reference objects were used for differential photometry .",
    "figure 4 shows the comparison between the variabilities of agns by differential photometry @xmath63 and by standards - based photometry @xmath64 for the case of the @xmath0 band .",
    "similar results in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands are not shown here .",
    "the distribution of data points , for the standards - based photometry with @xmath65 pixels , is elongated , more or less , along the diagonal in the @xmath63 versus @xmath64 diagram .",
    "however , increasing the aperture from @xmath65 to 15 pixels steadily increases the error ( see below ) , which destroys a clear correlation between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "figure 5 shows the comparison between errors by differential photometry @xmath66 and by standards - based photometry @xmath67 for the case of @xmath0 band .",
    "similar results in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands are not shown here .",
    "the first feature to be noticed is that many data points are concentrated along a linear sequence in the @xmath66 versus @xmath67 diagram .",
    "the second feature is that the sequence is inclined much closer to the @xmath67-axis for larger aperture .",
    "these features are consistent with a tendency in aperture photometry such that the s / n ratio becomes smaller for larger aperture , enhancing @xmath67 .",
    "the linear sequence seen in the @xmath66 versus @xmath67 diagram always has a slope much less than 1 .",
    "in particular , the slope is about 0.5 for the aperture of @xmath65 pixels , and about 0.1 for @xmath68 pixels .",
    "this shows that the accuracy of differential photometry is superior to standards - based photometry .",
    "a small number of outliers exist far above the linear sequence .",
    "their existence may be explained partly by larger fiducial error in differential photometry which gives a larger @xmath66 even for higher s / n ratio .",
    "such fiducial error may stem from a possible error of flat fielding , a contamination by variable stars in reference objects , and inaccurate photometry of objects near the edge of the frame . because of their small number , exclusion of such outliers from the sample does not improve the statistics in this paper .",
    "next , we quantitatively compare the accuracies of two methods , based on a frequency distribution of agns with respect to an error ratio @xmath69 . here the data plotted in fig . 5 are used .",
    "let @xmath70 be a fractional number of agns , having an error ratio larger than @xmath71 , relative to their total number .",
    "figure 6 shows the fraction @xmath70 plotted as a function of aperture for various values of @xmath71 in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands .",
    "this figure indicates that for most cases the fractional number of agns with the error ratio beyond unity comprises about @xmath72 in the sample . for standards",
    "- based photometry , the aperture which is 3 or 4 times larger than typical fwhm is usually used to avoid the influence of psf variation .",
    "this corresponds to an aperture of @xmath73 or 12 pixels , because a typical fwhm is about 3 pixels in our observations .",
    "such apertures give @xmath74 for @xmath75 , as seen from fig .",
    "therefore , the accuracy of differential photometory is @xmath76 times higher than that of standards - based photometry .    further suppression of fiducial error in differential photometry is possible , if the effects of flat - fielding error and inaccurate photometry near the frame edge can be minimized .",
    "it is then hoped that many bright reference objects can be chosen close enough to the target agn , but not too close to produce confusion .",
    "in such an ideal situation , the photometry only in some relevant area of all the dithering frames suffices , in contrast to the photometry over the entire dithered area as used in this paper .    in order for the magnum project to realize much higher accuracy in differential photometry , we select the candidate agns , which should satisfy the above criterion .",
    "owing not only to the sample selection , but also considering exposure time and dithering pattern , we can make the analysis go fainter without degrading the s / n ratio .",
    "a certain fraction of agns have certainly varied in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands . in this paper",
    ", we consider a sample of 226 agns data obtained with more than two reference objects and with an accuracy better than 0.1 mag .",
    "their variability data are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "we show the distribution of variability @xmath39 and redshift @xmath77 for the entire sample in fig . 7 , and the histogram with respect to @xmath39 in fig . 8 .",
    "as a measure of this variability , we introduce a ratio @xmath78 , and construct the frequency distribution of agns with respect to @xmath79 .",
    "figure 9 shows such a frequency distribution for our entire sample of 226 agns , and two samples of radio - quiet and radio - loud agns .",
    "all agns with @xmath80 are those that have varied most certainly and are included in the rightmost bin of @xmath81 .",
    "for both the entire sample and radio - quiet sample , the frequency monotonically decreases rightwards from the bin of @xmath82 to @xmath83 , and the peak occurs in the rightmost bin of @xmath81 .",
    "however , because of the small sample size , it is not easy to see similar features for the radio - loud sample .",
    "these results hold commonly for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "figure 10 shows the frequency distribution for the radio - quiet and radio - loud agns which are furthermore classified by rest - frame time interval @xmath84 between our two observations made for each agn . for the radio - quiet agns with short time interval of @xmath85 days ,",
    "the frequency monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath79 , and the frequency for @xmath80 is rare . on the other hand , for the radio - quiet agns , with the long time interval of @xmath86 days",
    ", the frequency stays almost constant over a range of @xmath87 , and shows a prominent peak at @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , most of radio - quiet agns that have certainly varied are those with time interval exceeding 400 days in rest frame . for the radio - loud agns , the frequency stays , more or less , constant , independent of time interval , though the sample size is too small to claim it definitely .",
    "figure 11 shows the frequency distribution for all agns which are divided by their error into three groups of high accuracy of @xmath88 , intermediate accuracy of @xmath89 , and low accuracy of @xmath90 .",
    "it is seen from this figure that the frequency distributions for these three groups differ remarkably from each other . for the high - accuracy group",
    ", the frequency is localized in the rightmost bin of @xmath80 , indicating that most agns in this group have certainly varied . on the other hand , for the low - accuracy group , the frequency",
    "is enhanced on the left .",
    "the frequency distribution for the intermediate - accuracy group is in between these two extremes .",
    "table 2 tabulates the estimated fraction of agns that have certainly varied with @xmath6 or @xmath7 confidence in various cases of different samples .",
    "the fraction of varied agns with @xmath6 confidence in the high - accuracy group is 85%(@xmath0 ) , 82%(@xmath1 ) , and 73%(@xmath2 ) , and the fraction for @xmath7 confidence is 73%(@xmath0 ) , 67%(@xmath1 ) , and 65%(@xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , based on the high - accuracy group with @xmath88 , we at least conclude that the detection rate of variable agns is about 80%(@xmath6 ) or 68%(@xmath7 ) .",
    "if the sample indeed contains some non - variable agns , the fraction of variable agns should become saturated as the accuracy increases . comparing three accuracy groups",
    ", we see no sign of such saturation towards higher accuracy . however , it is not possible to extrapolate this tendency ariving eventually at 100% to much higher accuracy , because other parameters are not uniform in the three accuracy groups . in particular , the high - accuracy group is biased in favor of nearby , bright , and radio - quiet agns .",
    "in contrast with our higher detection rate , neugebauer et al .",
    "( 1989 ) reported that about 24% of 108 agns in their @xmath9-band monitoring sample have certainly varied at the 99.7% confidence level , which is comparable to our result based on the low - accuracy group with @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , the shape of frequency distribution with respect to @xmath79 by neugebauer et al .",
    "( 1989 ) is also consistent with our result based on the low - accuracy group .",
    "consequently , it is likely that their low detection rate is only apparent because of the rather low accuracy in their observations which were based on the single detector with a @xmath91 arcsec beam .",
    "we present the @xmath12 variability data for a sample of 226 agns consisting mainly of seyfert 1 agns and qsos , each of which was observed twice in the period of @xmath92 in time interval of a year or more separating the observations . about a quater of the agns in each category are radio loud .",
    "the agns were selected covering a wide range of redshift from @xmath3 to 1 , and of absolute @xmath13-magnitude from @xmath93 mag to @xmath94 mag .",
    "the effect of psf variation can not be canceled completely in the differential photometry , because the target agns are not always seen as having the same psf profiles as the surrounding reference objects .",
    "the systematic error arising from this psf effect is estimated as about 0.01mag , which is smaller than other errors . considering all systematic errors from different sources",
    ", we were able to use a small aperture of 3 pixels , comparable to the seeing size .",
    "as a result , smaller statistical error was realized in the determination of agn variability by differential photometry than by usual standards - based photometry . in order to check the accuracy of our result",
    ", we also applied the differential photometry to the reference objects around agns , and confirmed that the above error estimation was reasonable , independent of the passband .",
    "significance of agn variability was measured by a ratio of variability relative to estimated error @xmath78 .",
    "since the @xmath79-values of the agns in our sample are similarly distributed irrespective of passband , we average the @xmath12 variabiliy for the agns of @xmath95 mag .",
    "then , the rate of variability detection , or the fraction of certainly varied agns in this sample is 58%(@xmath6 ) or 44%(3@xmath33 ) .",
    "we furthermore divide the sample into three groups of different error ranges such as high accuracy of @xmath88 , intermediate accuracy of @xmath89 , and low accuracy of @xmath90 .",
    "we then estimate the rate of variability detection in each of three groups .",
    "the frequency distribution of the agns with respect to @xmath79 for the low - accuracy group was skrewed towards smaller @xmath79 .",
    "on the other hand , for the high - accuracy group , the frequency distribution shows a prominant peak at @xmath80 , and the fraction of certainly varied agns in this group is 80%(@xmath6 ) or 68%(3@xmath33 ) .",
    "thus , the rate of variability detection is larger for higher accuracy .",
    "since this tendency shows no saturation , it does not exclude the possibility that all agns are indeed variable .    in conclusion ,",
    "the high detection rate in this paper is mainly obtained by our use of differential photometry with a small aperture of 3 pixels .",
    "the advantage of using differential photometry is to enable an efficient detection of variability in as many agns as possible with observations made only twice , with a long time interval of a year or more separating the observations .",
    "furthermore , the advantage of using a small aperture is not only to improve the s / n ratio but also to decrease the contribution of the agn host galaxy within the aperture , especially for nearby agns .",
    "we are grateful to h. okuda , m. narita and other staff of the infrared astronomy group of the institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) for their support in using their 1.3 m telescope .",
    "we thank the staff of the advanced technology center of the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) for their new coating of the primary mirror of the 1.3 m telescope at the isas .",
    "gratitude is also extended to the computer data analysis center of the naoj .",
    "this work has made use of the nasa / ipac extra galactic database ( ned ) , and has been supported partly by the grand - in - aid ( 07ce2002 , 10304014 ) of the ministry of education , science , culture , and sports of japan and by the torey science foundation .",

    "<S> all the objects were observed twice and their variability was measured by differential photometry .    </S>",
    "<S> a reduction method of differential photometry , optimized to the analysis of extended images , has been developed . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic error in variability arising from agns of highly extended images is estimated to be less than 0.01 mag in each of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic error arising from the flat fielding is negligible for most agns , although it is more than 0.1 mag for some particular cases . </S>",
    "<S> the overall average flat fielding error is 0.03 mag for the image pairs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these systematic errors are superseded by statistical errors , and the overall average total systematic and statistical errors amounts to 0.05 mag in the measured variability in each band .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that 58% of all the agns in the entire sample show variability of more than @xmath6 , and 44% of more than @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this result holds independent of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands . </S>",
    "<S> the detection rate of variability is higher for a subsample of higher photometric accuracy , and there appears no limit to this tendency . in particular , when we consider a subsample with small photometric errors of @xmath8 mag , the rate of @xmath6 detection is 80% , and 64% for @xmath7 detection . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that most agns are variable in the near - infrared . </S>"
