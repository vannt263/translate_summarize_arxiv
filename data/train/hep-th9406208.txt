    "the study of string - like objects has been actively pursued from both theoretical and experimental interests in various fields including condensed matter physics and biology . in particle physics and cosmology , the topological vortex string arising in field theory is one of the most interesting string - like objects .",
    "in particular , the abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) vortex string is the simplest one that splendidly shows typical properties of the vortex string @xcite . toward a better understanding of the physics on the vortex string , it is important to examine its geometric and topological properties in four space - time dimensions .",
    "we are especially interested in four dimensional extrinsic properties such as the entanglement of the vortex strings . for studying them ,",
    "we need a systematic formulation of the vortex string .",
    "the method used so far in evaluating the effective action of the vortex string in arbitrary shape is based on frster s parameterization of coordinates @xcite and the collective coordinates method @xcite . in this method , however , the cut - off dependence of the theory is not so clear and topological structures such as the self - intersection of the world sheet swept by the vortex string can not be so easily investigated .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to construct a more systematic and efficient formulation satisfying the following : ( i ) changes of the shapes of the vortex strings can be described , ( ii ) using perturbative expansions by appropriate parameters such as coupling constants , masses or cut - offs , one can perform systematic approximations , ( iii ) topological features of the vortex string can be easily examined .    in this paper , we present a `` topological '' formulation which satisfies the above three requirements and apply it to the arbitrarily shaped vortex strings in field theories with broken local or global @xmath2 symmetries .",
    "this is a relativistic generalization of the `` topological '' formulation used in the study of quantized vortices in superfluid helium @xcite .",
    "one of the characteristic features in our formulation is the appearance of an antisymmetric tensor field and a so - called topological bf term @xcite .",
    "we also adopt a manifestly lorentz invariant gaussian - type regularization for the @xmath3-functions in vorticity tensor currents . using our formulation",
    ", we first evaluate the effective action of the ano vortex string in the abelian higgs model , showing that it contains not only the nambu - goto term but also an extrinsic curvature squared term with negative sign .",
    "second , we examine the topological @xmath0 term , which for example appears as the chiral anomaly and the @xmath4 term .",
    "the evaluation of this term tells us that there are interesting relations between several geometric or topological quantities : polyakov s self - intersection number , ordinary self - intersection number , total twist number , self - linking number , writhing number and linking number .",
    "the expectation value of the @xmath0 term turns out to be the sum of polyakov s self - intersection number and the ordinary self - intersection number of the world sheet swept by the vortex string at the leading order of our approximation .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 term can be written as the difference of the sum of the writhing number and the linking number at the final time and the one at the initial time .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the chiral fermion number of the ano vortex strings in arbitrary shape by using the chiral anomaly and find it to be the sum of the writhing numbers of each vortex string ( modulo @xmath1 ) . to make the validity of our formulation clearer",
    ", we also study the dynamics of vortex strings in a model with a broken global @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "( in cosmology , the former ano vortex strings are called `` local strings '' and the latter ones are called `` global strings '' . ) in both models , it is also shown that the large higgs mass expansions are good approximations . as a whole",
    ", it is demonstrated that our `` topological '' formulation is useful to study the `` effective '' vortex strings .",
    "( the `` effective '' vortex string means the vortex string remaining after integration over massive fields in field theory . )    our formulation can be applied to several phenomenologies , although we do not completely discuss them in this paper .",
    "first , when we consider grand unified models with extra broken @xmath2 symmetries , then there can exist vortex strings which are topologically stable .",
    "their string tension is of order a gut - scale squared or possibly a fundamental string scale squared ( because the gauge coupling is smaller than 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , when the models have anomalous @xmath2 symmetries , it is interesting to investigate whether any fermion number can be violated through the effect of the vortex string .",
    "second , in the weinberg - salam theory , there appears the so - called @xmath5 string which is equivalent to the ano vortex string if one neglects other degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "it is a kind of sphaleron @xcite , which perhaps seems to be related to the weak - scale baryogenesis through the chiral anomaly @xcite .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the vortex string in arbitrary shape is important from the point of view of the fermion number violation . third , our theory can be directly applied to the cosmic string model @xcite and superconductor systems .",
    "finally , it should be noticed that the study of the effective vortex string would give us a new angle in understanding extrinsic properties of fundamental strings in four dimensional space - time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect . 2 and 3",
    ", we study the abelian higgs model with the vortex string .",
    "first , in sect .",
    "2 , we present our `` topological '' formulation and evaluate the effective action of the vortex string .",
    "next , in sect .",
    "3 , the @xmath0 term is examined and geometric or topological relations are shown .",
    "we also discuss the chiral fermion number of the vortex string in arbitrary shape . in sect .",
    "4 , we examine a model with the broken global @xmath2 symmetry . in sect . 5",
    ", we give conclusions and compare our results with previous ones . in appendix",
    "a , we explain the relation between polyakov s self - intersection number and the total twist number . in appendix b",
    ", we derive the relation between the intersection number and the linking number .",
    "in this section , we consider the abelian higgs model with an arbitrarily shaped vortex string in four space - time dimensions .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity we suppose the vortex string to be a closed one with circulation number one .",
    "it is easy to extend to the case with many vortex strings with arbitrary circulation numbers .",
    "we always use the euclidean formulation of field theory , so the model is described by the lagrangian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an ordinary @xmath2 gauge field , @xmath8 a complex scalar field and @xmath9 a field strength tensor of @xmath7 .",
    "the existence of the vortex string with circulation one means that when one takes a turn along any closed contour around the vortex string , the phase of the scalar field changes by 2@xmath10 . to get such a phase",
    ", we use the solid angle subtended by the vortex string @xmath11 where @xmath12 is any surface bounded by the vortex string : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denotes the position of the vortex string at time @xmath16 . in terms of this solid angle",
    ", the scalar field with the vortex string is described by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a regular function .",
    "when we substitute @xmath19 in ( [ eqn : ah ] ) , the differential term of @xmath19 changes and the covariance of ( [ eqn : ah ] ) is apparently broken .",
    "so we need an alternative formulation where the covariance is manifest and it is easier to deal with the vortex string .    we propose a manifestly covariant lagrangian with a topological term and a vorticity tensor current , which is equivalent to the original one ( [ eqn : ah ] ) in the sense explained later : @xmath20 where @xmath21 } \\delta^{(4)}(x - x(\\sigma ) ) \\label{eqn : cur}\\ ] ] is the vorticity tensor current and @xmath22 another @xmath2 gauge field for the vorticity , @xmath23 a rank two antisymmetric tensor field , @xmath24 a field strength tensor of @xmath22 , @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27}=a_{\\mu}b_{\\nu}-a_{\\nu}b_{\\mu}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath28 denotes the four dimensional location of the vortex string , where @xmath29 are the coordinates which parameterize the world sheet swept by the vortex string .",
    "actually , variations of ( [ eqn : tah ] ) with respect to @xmath23 lead to the constraint @xmath30 and if we choose the coulomb gauge @xmath31 and a gauge @xmath32 , then we get @xmath33 and @xmath34 so that this lagrangian ( [ eqn : tah ] ) turns out to be the original one ( [ eqn : ah ] ) into which the redefined scalar field @xmath19 is inserted . from now on , let us use the lagrangian ( [ eqn : tah ] ) as our starting point for the theory .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eqn : tah ] ) has some interesting properties .",
    "( i ) it has two types of gauge symmetries except the usual @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "the first one is another @xmath2 gauge symmetry : @xmath35 and @xmath36 with an arbitrary regular function @xmath37 .",
    "the second one is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is also an arbitrary regular function .",
    "the corresponding conserved tensor current is @xmath40 , so that the total vorticity @xmath41 is conserved .",
    "( ii ) it has the topological term @xmath42 , which is called a bf term . in general the bf term",
    "is used in evaluating linking numbers which are topological numbers counting how many times a string and a two dimensional membrane are entangled in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "the topological bf term is a generalization of the chern - simons term which plays an important role in the study of the quantized hall effect and anyon systems in @xmath43 dimensions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this term appears in various areas of theoretical physics , for example , in models with anomalous u(1 ) charges in superstring theory @xcite and four dimensional 2-form gravity @xcite . through this term",
    ", we may be able to search some connections between such theories and the present theory on the vortex string .",
    "( iii ) since the vortex string coordinates @xmath28 are contained only in the vorticity tensor current @xmath40 , which can describe the vortex string in arbitrary shape , our formulation is useful in many cases , for example , in cases where the vortex core needs regularizing or one derives the equation of motion of the vortex string .",
    "we are interested in the effective action of the vortex string defined by @xmath44= - \\ln\\int{\\cal d}\\phi{\\cal d}a_{\\mu}{\\cal d }                       a_{\\mu}{\\cal d}b_{\\mu\\nu }                       \\exp\\left(-\\int d^{4}x { \\cal l}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eqn : eff}\\ ] ] this path integral representation is suitable for the evaluation of the effective action since systematic perturbative expansions can be easily performed .",
    "we do not consider the quantization of @xmath45 and the effects from loops of the fields in this paper , although it is of course interesting to study them . before computing the effective action ,",
    "let us discuss some points to clarify our procedure .    as well known , in the static solution of the straight ano vortex , it is satisfied that @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the distant region from the vortex core , where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is an azimuthal angle ) and  @xmath50 \" implies  exponentially small \" . even in general cases with moving vortex strings , if we require that the energy is finite , it should be satisfied that @xmath46 and @xmath51 in the distant region from the vortex core",
    ". furthermore , since @xmath52 , the vortex string is topologically stable .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expand @xmath53 and @xmath54 around @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively in such a region .",
    "so , instead of @xmath53 and @xmath7 , let us adopt two scalar fields @xmath57 , @xmath58 and a vector field @xmath59 defined by @xmath60 after these replacements , our action still keeps the gauge invariance under @xmath61 , so that we get a gauge invariant effective action for @xmath22 when we integrate over the fields @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this fact is convenient for evaluating the effective action of the vortex string .    in the unitary gauge , where @xmath62 is replaced with @xmath63 ,",
    "the lagrangian becomes @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "propagators of @xmath57 and @xmath63 , which are denoted as @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , are given by @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the resulting feynman rules for the propagators and the vertices are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : pg ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : vt ] .",
    "note that since we do not exactly know the inside structure of the vortex core when the vortex string is moving , it is necessary to assume its structure and introduce an appropriate cut - off parameter .",
    "the ansatz which we actually apply to our system is that the @xmath72-function in the vorticity tensor current @xmath40 is regularized smoothly in the cut - off region . in this paper",
    ", we make use of the first expression of the following gaussian - type regularization : @xmath73 where the second expression shows that the momentum is effectively cut off at about @xmath74 . in this regularization ,",
    "the lorentz invariance is manifest and the conservation of the vorticity tensor current , @xmath75 , is also preserved .",
    "it is one of crucial reasons why our formulation is a convenient one to evaluate fine structures of the effective action of the vortex string and topological properties such as the self - intersection number of the world sheet swept by the vortex string .    in systematic estimations of the order of each tree diagram for the effective action",
    ", we can perform the large mass expansion by powers of @xmath76 when @xmath77 is larger than other mass scales .",
    "especially , in this large higgs mass expansion , the propagator of the higgs field @xmath57 can be treated as @xmath78 using ordinary relations between numbers of vertices , propagators and external lines for the diagrams , a simple power counting tells us that at the tree level the leading power of @xmath76 for feynman diagrams with @xmath79 circle ( @xmath80 ) , which are corresponding to parts of the effective action with @xmath79 vorticity tensor currents , is given by @xmath81 here m are @xmath82 , @xmath74 or @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes the characteristic length which represents the smoothness of the vortex string , that is , the magnitude of higher order derivatives of @xmath85 .",
    "hence , it turns out that the diagrams with smaller numbers of vorticity tensor currents are dominant for the effective action .",
    "let us turn our attention now to the evaluation of the effective action of the vortex string .",
    "the leading contribution @xmath86 to it , which has two vorticity tensor currents and corresponds to feynman diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ld ] , can be evaluated in the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 here we have used the conservation law of the vorticity tensor current @xmath40 .",
    "the form of @xmath86 expresses that massive particles propagate between two points on the world sheet swept by the vortex string .",
    "we will now evaluate the dominant effects arising in the case where two vorticity tensor currents approach each other . for that purpose , we adopt the proper time representation of the propagator @xmath89 : @xmath90 .",

    "the factor @xmath95 in ( [ eqn : l - lead-2 ] ) indicates that the region where @xmath96 is small mainly contributes to @xmath86 and the factor @xmath97 in ( [ eqn : l - lead-2 ] ) shows that the region where @xmath98 is the dominant part of contributions to @xmath86 when @xmath96 is small . putting these together",
    ", it turns out that the dominant contribution to @xmath86 comes from the region where @xmath99 is near @xmath100 , so let us consider the case where @xmath101 is near @xmath102 . in order to investigate the behavior of @xmath86 in the case where @xmath103 is near @xmath104",
    ", we define @xmath105 as @xmath106 and expand @xmath107 in powers of @xmath105 : @xmath108 after substitution of ( [ eqn : exp - x ] ) in ( [ eqn : l - lead-2 ] ) and integration over @xmath105 , the effective action @xmath86 takes the particularly simple form up to @xmath109 in powers of @xmath110 and @xmath111 : @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 . here",

    "here we have neglected contributions from boundaries and intersection points of the world sheet swept by the vortex string . in evaluating the second term of ( [ eqn : ng ] )",
    ", we have used the fact that the scalar curvature defined by @xmath124 is a total divergence .",
    "the first term in the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : ng ] ) is the nambu - goto action and the second term is the extrinsic curvature squared term which was investigated from the point of view of the qcd string @xcite .",
    "let us make a comparison between the string tension @xmath125 and the one @xmath126 evaluated by using the static ano vortex solution in the case where @xmath77 is much larger than @xmath127 .",

    "the ano vortex solution @xmath131 is regular for @xmath132 . using a cut - off @xmath133 such that @xmath134 , one can easily obtain the string tension @xmath126 , which is the energy per unit length along the third axis : @xmath135 the dominant contribution to the string tension @xmath136 comes from the intermediate region satisfying @xmath137 .",
    "in addition , the contribution from the vortex core , which is about @xmath138 , is much smaller than the dominant one . on the other hand",
    ", our string tension @xmath139 behaves like @xmath140 when @xmath141 .",
    "we therefore get @xmath142 if we require both string tensions are equal .",
    "this shows that our formulation is justified when we take about @xmath133 as @xmath74 .",
    "note that we should not use the expansion in positive powers of @xmath143 because @xmath144 , though it is valid to expand the theory in powers of @xmath76 when @xmath77 is large enough .",
    "this fact is one of our grounds for using the expansion in powers of @xmath76 . in addition",
    ", it may be worth pointing out that the exponential integral in the string tension @xmath145 given by ( [ eqn : st ] ) depends on only the ratio of @xmath146 to @xmath147 .",
    "as concerns the coefficient @xmath148 , there are two remarkable points .",
    "first , it takes the non - zero value with negative sign , which indicates that the vortex string prefers curving as far as it is smooth enough .",
    "our approximation is relevant only in the case where the characteristic length representing the curvature of the vortex string is large enough in comparison with the lengths @xmath76 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , so that the apparent unboundedness of the effective action ( [ eqn : ng ] ) is not a trouble within the approximation which we have used .",
    "one may notice that our theory is positive definite by the definition of the lagrangian ( [ eqn : tah ] ) .",
    "second , the @xmath148 is independent of @xmath127 and @xmath74 unlike the string tension @xmath125 .    to confirm the validity of the expansion by the large higgs mass ,",
    "let us evaluate the next leading contribution whose diagram has four vorticity tensor currents , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nld ] .",
    "the next leading effective action @xmath151 is dominated by the case where the four vorticity tensor currents approach in the same time , and the dominant term becomes the nambu - goto term .",
    "indeed , by repeating the procedure used previously , we can calculate @xmath151 : @xmath152 where @xmath153 here @xmath154 in the next leading string tension @xmath155 is a complicated function of @xmath156 but finite . as @xmath157 ,",
    "this function behaves like @xmath158 at most , so that the ratio of @xmath155 to @xmath125 is at most given by @xmath159 it demonstrates that this ratio is small if @xmath160 .",
    "our large higgs mass expansion is therefore valid under this condition on the higgs mass .",
    "this is consistent with the power counting of ( [ eqn : pc ] ) , because @xmath161 has been counted as @xmath109 in ( [ eqn : pc ] ) .",
    "it may be worth while to point out that the calculations for @xmath139 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 are somewhat similar to the ones for effective actions and @xmath164 functions in `` the zero - slope limit '' of ( fundamental ) string theory or non - linear @xmath104 models .",
    "more detailed investigation of this correspondence will be interesting .    to make our discussion clear , let us summarize the conditions used in our approximation . in the evaluation of the effective action of the ano vortex",
    "string we have supposed the following four conditions , under which our approximation is justified .",
    "( i ) the coupling constants are small : @xmath165 , @xmath166 .",
    "( this ensures that loop effects are small . )",
    "( ii ) the higgs mass is large enough than the mass of the gauge field : @xmath167 , meaning @xmath168 .",
    "( iii ) the vortex string is long and smooth enough in comparison with @xmath169 and @xmath170 : @xmath171 , @xmath172 .",
    "( @xmath84 denotes the characteristic length which represents the smoothness of the vortex string . )",
    "( iv ) the cut - off parameter @xmath173 of the @xmath3-function in the vorticity tensor current is smaller than the higgs mass and larger than @xmath83 : @xmath174 .",
    "( the condition @xmath175 is consistent with the analysis in which we have used the classical vortex solution as explained under ( [ eqn : ano ] ) . ) under the conditions ( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( iv ) , the large higgs mass expansion which we have adopted is allowed .",
    "we will also impose the same condition in evaluating the @xmath0 term in the next section .",
    "if one can construct a formulation for systematic evaluation of quantities on the vortex string without imposing the conditions ( iii ) and ( iv ) , then one would get more interesting information about the vortex string .",
    "for example , it would be possible to understand deep relations between the effective vortex string and the fundamental string .",
    "the purpose of this section is to examine geometric and topological properties of the abelian higgs model with vortex strings . in doing so ,",
    "our formulation is very useful , since we can treat the vortex string in arbitrary shape . to investigate these properties in detail , we concentrate on the topological term @xmath177 defined by @xmath178 which in general appears as the chiral anomaly and the cp violating @xmath179 term in the action . here",
    "the definition of the `` dual '' is the following : @xmath180 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath181 indicates the integral value of @xmath182 over all fields @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 except the vortex string coordinates @xmath45 in the path integral representation . as will be clarified below , this topological term is closely related to the geometric and topological properties of the vortex string such as the self - intersection number of the world sheet swept by the vortex string .",
    "notice that the world sheet swept by the vortex string can intersect with itself , that is , the vortex string coordinate @xmath45 is an immersion of a two dimensional parameter space into the four dimensional euclidean space - time @xmath187 . in subsequent subsections ,",
    "first we explicitly evaluate @xmath177 in the cases where the number of the vortex strings is conserved and the vortex string reconnection does not occur , then discuss its generalization .",
    "in addition , in the last part of this section we discuss the chiral fermion number of the ano vortex string .",
    "first , we study the case in which a single vortex string exists and the vortex string reconnection does not occur . since the gauge field @xmath188",
