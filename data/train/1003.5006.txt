    "a hundred years and more of fundamental research in atomic and nuclear physics has shown us that all matter is corpuscular , with the atoms that comprise us , themselves containing a dense nuclear core .",
    "this core is composed of protons and neutrons , referred to collectively as nucleons , which are members of a broader class of femtometre - scale particles , called hadrons . in working toward an understanding of hadrons",
    ", we have discovered that they are complicated bound - states of quarks and gluons , which are elementary and pointlike excitations whose interactions are described by a poincar invariant quantum non - abelian gauge field theory ; namely , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the goal of hadron physics is the provision of a quantitative explanation of the properties of hadrons through a solution of qcd .",
    "quantum chromodynamics is the strong - interaction part of the standard model of particle physics and solving qcd presents a fundamental problem that is unique in the history of science .",
    "never before have we been confronted by a theory whose elementary excitations are not those degrees - of - freedom readily accessible via experiment ; i.e. , whose elementary excitations are confined .",
    "moreover , we have numerous reasons to believe that qcd generates forces which are so strong that less - than 2% of a nucleon s mass can be attributed to the so - called current - quark masses that appear in the qcd lagrangian ; viz .",
    ", forces that generate mass from almost nothing , a phenomenon known as dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) .",
    "neither confinement nor dcsb is apparent in qcd s lagrangian and yet they play the dominant role in determining the observable characteristics of real - world qcd .",
    "the physics of hadrons is ruled by _ emergent phenomena _ , such as these , which can only be elucidated through the employment of nonperturbative methods in quantum field theory .",
    "this is both the greatest novelty and the greatest challenge within the standard model .",
    "we must find essentially new ways and means to explain precisely via mathematics the observable content of qcd .",
    "this contribution to these proceedings provides an introduction to hadron physics and a review of selected recent progress in this field made using qcd s dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) .",
    "the complex of dses is a powerful tool , which has been employed with marked success to study confinement and dcsb , and their impact on hadron observables .",
    "this is apparent from the detailed background material that is available in refs.@xcite and will be exemplified herein .",
    "the basic problem of hadron physics is to solve qcd .",
    "this inspiring goal will only be achieved through a joint effort from experiment and theory .",
    "the hadron physics community now has a range of major facilities that are accumulating data , of unprecedented accuracy and precision , which pose important challenges for theory .",
    "notable amongst these facilities is the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) in newport news , virginia . the interpretation and prediction of phenomena at jlab provide the themes for much of the material presented herein . in hadron physics , it is the feedback between experiment and theory that leads most rapidly to progress in understanding . the opportunities for researchers in hadron physics promise to grow because upgraded and new facilities will appear on a five - to - ten - year time - scale @xcite .",
    "asymptotic coloured states have not been observed , but is it a cardinal fact that they can not ?",
    "no solution to qcd will be complete if it does not explain confinement .",
    "this means confinement in the real world , which contains quarks with light current - quark masses .",
    "this is distinct from the artificial universe of pure - gauge qcd without dynamical quarks , studies of which tend merely to focus on achieving an area law for a wilson loop and hence are irrelevant to the question of light - quark confinement .    in stepping toward an answer to the question of confinement",
    ", it will likely be necessary to map out the long - range behaviour of the interaction between light - quarks ; namely , qcd s @xmath4-function at infrared momenta . in this connection",
    "we note that the spectrum of meson and baryon excited states , and hadron elastic and transition form factors provide unique information about the long - range interaction between light - quarks and , in addition , the distribution of a hadron s characterising properties  such as mass and momentum , linear and angular  amongst its qcd constituents .",
    "the upgraded and promised future facilities will provide data that should guide the charting process .",
    "however , to make full use of that data , it will be necessary to have poincar covariant theoretical tools that enable the reliable study of hadrons in the mass range @xmath5-@xmath6gev .",
    "crucially , on this domain both confinement and dcsb are germane .",
    "dressed - quark mass function , @xmath7 in eq.([sgeneral ] ) : _ solid curves _  dse results , obtained as explained in @xcite , `` data ''  numerical simulations of lattice - qcd @xcite .",
    "( nb .  @xmath8mev is the uppermost curve and current - quark mass decreases from top to bottom . )",
    "one observes the current - quark of perturbative qcd evolving into a constituent - quark as its momentum becomes smaller .",
    "the constituent - quark mass arises from a cloud of low - momentum gluons attaching themselves to the current - quark .",
    "this is dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) : an essentially nonperturbative effect that generates a quark mass _ from nothing _ ; namely , it occurs even in the chiral limit .",
    "( figure adapted from ref.@xcite . ) ]    it is known that dcsb ; namely , the generation of mass _ from nothing _ , does take place in qcd .",
    "it arises primarily because a dense cloud of gluons comes to clothe a low - momentum quark @xcite .",
    "this is best seen by solving the dse for the dressed - quark propagator ; i.e. , the gap equation , which yields the result illustrated in fig.[gluoncloud ] . however , the origin of the interaction strength at infrared momenta , which guarantees dcsb through the gap equation , is currently unknown . this relationship ties confinement to dcsb .",
    "the reality of dcsb means that the higgs mechanism is largely irrelevant to the bulk of normal matter in the universe .",
    "instead the single most important mass generating mechanism for light - quark hadrons is the strong interaction effect of dcsb ; e.g. , one can identify it as being responsible for 98% of a proton s mass .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the connection between confinement and dcsb is accidental or causal .",
    "there are models with dcsb but not confinement , however , a model with confinement but lacking dcsb has not yet been identified ( see , e.g. , secs.2.1 and 2.2 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this leads to a conjecture that dcsb is a necessary consequence of confinement .",
    "it is interesting that there are numerous models and theories which exhibit both confinement and dcsb , and possess an external control parameter such that deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration occur simultaneously at some critical value of this parameter ; e.g. , quantum electrodynamics in three dimensions with @xmath9 electrons @xcite , and models of qcd at nonzero temperature and chemical potential @xcite .",
    "whether this simultaneity is a property possessed by qcd , and/or some broader class of theories , in response to changes in : the number of light - quark flavours ; temperature ; or chemical potential , is a longstanding question .",
    "the momentum - dependence of the quark mass , illustrated in fig.[gluoncloud ] , is an essentially quantum field theoretic effect , unrealisable in quantum mechanics , and a fundamental feature of qcd .",
    "this single curve connects the infrared and ultraviolet regimes of the theory , and establishes that the constituent - quark and current - quark masses are simply two connected points separated by a large momentum interval .",
    "the curve shows that qcd s dressed - quark behaves as a constituent - quark , a current - quark , or something in between , depending on the momentum of the probe which explores the bound - state containing the dressed - quark .",
    "it follows that calculations addressing momentum transfers @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mass of the hadron involved , require a poincar - covariant approach that can veraciously realise quantum field theoretical effects @xcite .",
    "owing to the vector - exchange character of qcd , covariance also guarantees the existence of nonzero quark orbital angular momentum in a hadron s rest - frame @xcite .",
    "the dressed - quark mass function has a remarkable capacity to correlate and be party to explaining a wide range of diverse phenomena .",
    "this brings urgency to the need to understand the relationship between parton properties in the light - front frame , whose peculiar properties simplify some theoretical analyses , and the structure of hadrons as measured in the rest frame or other smoothly related frames .",
    "this is a problem because , e.g. , dcsb , an established keystone of low - energy qcd , has not been realised in the light - front formulation .",
    "the obstacle is the constraint @xmath12 for massive quanta on the light front @xcite .",
    "it is therefore impossible to make zero momentum fock states that contain particles and hence the vacuum is trivial .",
    "only the zero modes of light - front quantisation can dress the ground state but little progress has been made with understanding just how that might occur . on the other hand , it is conceivable that this dressing is inextricably tied with the formation and structure of goldstone modes and not otherwise a measurable property of the vacuum .",
    "this conjecture is being explored @xcite .",
    "in addition , parton distribution functions , which have a probability interpretation in the infinite momentum frame , must be calculated in order to comprehend their content : parametrisation is insufficient",
    ". it would be very interesting to know , e.g. , how , if at all , the distribution functions of a goldstone mode differ from those of other hadrons @xcite .",
    "it is worth stating plainly that the potential between infinitely - heavy quarks measured in numerical simulations of quenched lattice - regularised qcd  the so - called static potential  is simply _ irrelevant _ to the question of confinement in the real world , in which light quarks are ubiquitous .",
    "in fact , it is a basic feature of qcd that light - particle creation and annihilation effects are essentially nonperturbative and therefore it is impossible in principle to compute a potential between two light quarks @xcite .",
    "a perspective on confinement was laid out in ref.@xcite .",
    "confinement can be related to the analytic properties of qcd s schwinger functions , which are often called euclidean - space green functions .",
    "for example , it can be read from the reconstruction theorem @xcite that the only schwinger functions which can be associated with expectation values in the hilbert space of observables ; namely , the set of measurable expectation values , are those that satisfy the axiom of reflection positivity .",
    "this is an extremely tight constraint .",
    "it can be shown to require as a necessary condition that the fourier transform of the momentum - space schwinger function is a positive - definite function of its arguments , and is discussed and illustrated in sec .  2 of ref.@xcite .",
    "from this standpoint the question of light - quark confinement can be translated into the challenge of charting the infrared behavior of qcd s _ universal _ @xmath4-function .",
    "( although this function may depend on the scheme chosen to renormalise the theory , it is unique within a given scheme @xcite . of course , the behaviour of the @xmath4-function on the perturbative domain is well known . )",
    "this is a well - posed problem whose solution is an elemental goal of modern hadron physics and which can be addressed in any framework enabling the nonperturbative evaluation of renormalisation constants .",
    "through the gap and bethe - salpeter equations ( bses ) the pointwise behaviour of the @xmath4-function determines the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking ; e.g. , the behaviour in fig.[gluoncloud ] .",
    "moreover , the fact that these and other dses connect the @xmath4-function to experimental observables entails , e.g. , that comparison between computations and observations of the hadron mass spectrum , and hadron elastic and transition form factors , can be used to chart the @xmath4-function s long - range behaviour .    in order to realise this goal",
    ", a nonperturbative symmetry - preserving dse truncation is necessary .",
    "steady quantitative progress can be made with a scheme that is systematically improvable @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mere existence of such a scheme has enabled the proof of exact nonperturbative results in qcd .",
    "for example , there are veracious statements about radially - excited and hybrid pseudoscalar mesons @xcite ; and regarding the @xmath13-@xmath14 complex and @xmath15-@xmath13-@xmath14 mixing , with predictions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite . in connection with these systems ,",
    "only theoretical studies that are demonstrably consistent with the results proved in refs.@xcite can be considered seriously .",
    "in addition , a novel result for the pion susceptibility was recently obtained via the isovector - pseudoscalar vacuum polarisation @xcite ; viz .",
    ", in the neighbourhood of the chiral - limit the pion susceptibility can be expressed as a sum of two independent terms : @xmath18 the first expresses the pion - pole contribution and involves the so - called vacuum - quark condensate .",
    "the second is identical to the vacuum chiral susceptibility , which describes the response of qcd s ground - state to a fluctuation in the current - quark mass .",
    "equation([main ] ) is a remarkable result , which is nonetheless readily understood .",
    "recall that in the absence of a current - quark mass , the two - flavour qcd action has a su@xmath19su@xmath20 symmetry ; and , moreover , that ascribing scalar - isoscalar quantum numbers to the qcd vacuum is a convention , contingent upon the form of the current - quark mass term .",
    "it follows that the massless action can not distinguish between the continuum of sources specified by @xmath21 hence , the regular part of the vacuum susceptibility must be identical when measured as the response to any one of these sources , so that @xmath22 for all choices of @xmath23 .",
    "this is the content of the so - called `` mexican hat '' potential , which is used in building models for qcd .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath24 depends on whether the chiral symmetry is dynamically broken , or not ; and the strength of the interaction as measured with respect to the critical value required for dcsb @xcite .",
    "when the symmetry is dynamically broken , then the goldstone modes appear , by convention , in the pseudoscalar - isovector channel , and thus the pole contributions appear in @xmath25 but not in the chiral susceptibility .",
    "it is valid to draw an analogy with the weinberg sum rule @xcite .      despite the successes achieved with the systematic scheme",
    ", one anticipates that significant qualitative advances in understanding the essence of qcd could be made with symmetry - preserving kernel _ anstze _ that expresses important additional nonperturbative effects , which are impossible to capture in any finite sum of contributions .",
    "such an approach has recently become available @xcite and is worth summarising herein .",
    "consider , e.g. , pseudoscalar and axial - vector mesons , which appear as poles in the inhomogeneous bse for the axial - vector vertex , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are flavour labels .",
    "an exact form of that equation is ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 are relative momenta , @xmath30 is the total momentum flowing into the vertex , and @xmath31 , etc . )",

    "of course , no constituent - quark - model can be connected systematically with qcd .",
    "nevertheless , as we observed above , the presence of orbital angular momentum in a hadron s rest frame is a necessary consequence of poincar covariance and the vector - boson - exchange character of qcd @xcite , so there is a realisation in qcd of the quark - model anticipation .",
    "extant studies of realistic corrections to the rainbow - ladder truncation show that they reduce hyperfine splitting @xcite .",
    "hence , with the comparison between eqs.([epsilonrl ] ) and ( [ epsilonbc ] ) one has a clear indication that in a poincar covariant treatment the bc - consistent truncation magnifies spin - orbit splitting , an effect which can be attributed to the influence of the quark s dynamically - enhanced scalar self - energy @xcite in the bethe - salpeter kernel .",

    "model ratio @xmath93 evaluated at @xmath88gev@xmath89 , _ dashed curve _ , and @xmath90gev@xmath89 , _ solid curve_. @xmath94 . under the right conditions , @xmath93 should equal the ratio of kaon - to - pion drell - yan cross - sections , and we reproduce that obtained from a sample of dimuon events with invariant mass @xmath95gev @xcite . ]    in fig.[shigetanisoft ] we depict our computed distributions themselves and relevant ratios .",
    "aspects of the curves are model - independent .",
    "for example , owing to its larger mass , one anticipates that the @xmath96-quark should carry more of the charged - kaon s momentum than the @xmath57-quark .",
    "this explains , in a manner which is transparent in this model , why the support of @xmath97 is shifted to lower-@xmath98 than that @xmath99 .",
    "qcd evolution is an area - conserving operation on the distribution function , which shifts support from large-@xmath98 to small-@xmath98 .",
    "thus , while both @xmath100 for @xmath101 , @xmath102 these observations explain the qualitative behaviour of the evolved distributions . concerning the ratio , as a consequence of the form of the evolution equations , the value of the ratio at @xmath85 is invariant under evolution .",
    "at the other extreme , the value of the ratio at @xmath103 approaches one under evolution owing to the increasingly large population of sea - quarks produced thereby .",
    "while a symmetry - preserving description of mesons is essential , it is only part of the physics that nonperturbative qcd must describe since nature also presents baryons , light - quarks in three - particle composites .",
    "an explanation of the spectrum of baryons and the nature of interactions between them is basic to understanding the standard model .",
    "the present and planned experimental programmes at jlab , and other facilities worldwide , are critical elements in this effort .",
    "no approach to qcd is comprehensive if it can not provide a unified explanation of both mesons and baryons .",
    "we have explained that dcsb is a keystone of the standard model , which is evident in the momentum - dependence of the dressed - quark mass function  fig.[gluoncloud ] : it is just as important to baryons as it is to mesons .",
    "the dses furnish the only extant framework that can simultaneously connect both meson and baryon observables with this basic feature of qcd , having provided , e.g. , a direct correlation of meson and baryon properties via a single interaction kernel , which preserves qcd s one - loop renormalisation group behaviour and can systematically be improved @xcite .    in quantum field theory",
    "a baryon appears as a pole in a six - point quark green function .",
    "the residue is proportional to the baryon s faddeev amplitude , which is obtained from a poincar covariant faddeev equation that sums all possible exchanges and interactions that can take place between three dressed - quarks .",
    "a tractable faddeev equation for baryons @xcite is founded on the observation that an interaction which describes colour - singlet mesons also generates nonpointlike quark - quark ( diquark ) correlations in the colour-@xmath104 ( antitriplet ) channel @xcite .",
    "the lightest diquark correlations appear in the @xmath105 channels @xcite and hence only they need be retained in approximating the quark - quark scattering matrix that appears as part of the faddeev equation @xcite .",
    "diquarks do not appear in the strong interaction spectrum @xcite but the attraction between quarks in this channel justifies a picture of baryons in which two quarks within a baryon are always correlated as a colour-@xmath104 diquark pseudoparticle , and binding is effected by the iterated exchange of roles between the bystander and diquark - participant quarks .",
    "here it is important to emphasise strongly that qcd supports _ nonpointlike _ diquark correlations @xcite .",
    "hence models that employ pointlike diquark degrees of freedom have little connection with qcd .",
    "numerous properties of the nucleon have been computed using the faddeev equation just described .",
    "herein we draw only two examples from comprehensive analyses of nucleon electromagnetic form factors @xcite .",
    "to introduce the results , we note that the nucleon s electromagnetic current is @xmath106 where @xmath30 ( @xmath107 ) is the momentum of the incoming ( outgoing ) nucleon , @xmath108 is the momentum transfer , and @xmath109 and @xmath110 are , respectively , the dirac and pauli form factors , from which one obtains the nucleon s electric and magnetic ( sachs ) form factors @xmath111     . computed ratio of flavour - separated contributions to neutron s dirac form factor ( @xmath112nucleon mass ) _",

    "the predicted @xmath113-dependence owes to the presence of axial - vector diquark correlations in the nucleon .",
    "it has been found @xcite that the neutron s singly - represented @xmath57-quark is more likely to be struck in association with an axial - vector diquark correlation than with a scalar , and form factor contributions involving an axial - vector diquark are soft . on the other hand ,",
    "the doubly - represented @xmath58-quark is predominantly linked with harder scalar - diquark contributions .",

    "we depict @xmath3 computed using the faddeev equation @xcite .",
    "given that it is common practice to compare nucleon form factors with an empirical dipole , the dse result is presented in a similar way .",
    "namely , the function @xmath115 was fitted to the dse result on @xmath116 .",
    "this domain excludes the region whereupon pion cloud effects are significant and maximises coverage of the domain on which the quark - core calculation is most reliable .",
    "the fit produced @xmath117 cf .",
    "the empirical value , @xmath118 , which is just 14% smaller .",
    "the dse predictions in fig.[gmngilfoyle ] depend sensitively on the momentum - dependence of the dressed - quark mass function , which feeds into properties such as the diquarks mass and size .",
    "since in the computation of elastic and transition form factors , the probe s input momentum @xmath119 is principally shared equally amongst the dressed - quarks , then each absorbs a momentum fraction @xmath120 .",
    "thus , to scan the behaviour of the mass function on the domain @xmath121\\,$]gev@xmath89 , upon which its character changes from nonperturbative to perturbative , one requires @xmath122\\,$]gev@xmath89 .",
    "the figure illustrates that comparison and feedback between dse results and forthcoming precision data on nucleon form factors can serve as a means by which to empirically chart the momentum evolution of the dressed - quark mass function , and therefrom the infrared behavior of qcd s @xmath4-function .",
    "in particular , it should enable the unambiguous location of the transition boundary between the constituent- and current - quark domains that is signalled by the sharp drop apparent in fig.[gluoncloud ] and which can likely be related to an infrared inflexion point in qcd s running coupling , whose properties are determined by the @xmath4-function .",
    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) is a fact in qcd .",
    "it is manifest in dressed - propagators and vertices , and , amongst other things , it is responsible for : the transformation of the light current - quarks in qcd s lagrangian into heavy constituent - like quark s , in terms of which order was first brought to the hadron spectrum ; the unnaturally small values of the masses of light - quark pseudoscalar mesons ; the unnaturally strong coupling of pseudoscalar mesons to light - quarks ",
    "@xmath123 ; and the unnaturally strong coupling of pseudoscalar mesons to the lightest baryons  @xmath124 .",
    "herein we have illustrated the dramatic impact that dcsb has upon observables : the spectrum , secs.[spectrum1 ] and [ spectrum2 ] ; hadron form factors , secs.[ff1 ] and [ ff3 ] ; and parton distribution functions , sec.[ff2 ] .",
    "a `` smoking gun '' for dcsb is the behaviour of the dressed - quark mass function .",
    "the momentum dependence manifest in fig.[gluoncloud ] is an essentially quantum field theoretical effect .",
    "exposing and elucidating its effects therefore requires a nonperturbative and symmetry - preserving approach , where the latter means preserving poincar covariance , chiral and electromagnetic current - conservation , etc .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) provide such a framework .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies are underway that will identify observable signals of @xmath125 and thereby explain the most important mass - generating mechanism for visible matter in the standard model .",
    "there are many reasons why this is an exciting time in hadron physics .",
    "we have focused on one .",
    "namely , through the dses , we are positioned to unify phenomena as apparently diverse as the : hadron spectrum ; hadron elastic and transition form factors , from small- to large-@xmath113 ; and parton distribution functions .",
    "the key is an understanding of both the fundamental origin of nuclear mass and the far - reaching consequences of the mechanism responsible ; namely , dcsb .",

    "<S> dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) is a remarkably effective mass generating mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> it is also , amongst other things , the foundation for a successful application of chiral effective field theories , the origin of constituent - quark masses , and intimately connected with confinement in qcd . using the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) </S>",
    "<S> , we explain the origin and nature of dcsb , and elucidate some of its consequences , e.g. : a model - independent result for the pion susceptibility ; the generation of a quark anomalous chromomagnetic moment , which may explain the longstanding puzzle of the @xmath0-@xmath1 mass splitting ; its impact on the behaviour of the electromagnetic pion form factor  thereby illustrating how data can be used to chart the momentum - dependence of the dressed - quark mass function ; in the form of the pion and kaon valence - quark parton distribution functions , and the relation between them ; and aspects of the neutron s electromagnetic form factors , in particular @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that in solving qcd , a constructive feedback between theory and extant and forthcoming experiments will most rapidly enable constraints to be placed on the infrared behaviour of qcd s @xmath4-function , the nonperturbative quantity at the core of hadron physics ; and emphasise throughout the role played by confrontation with data as a means of verifying our understanding of nature .     </S>",
