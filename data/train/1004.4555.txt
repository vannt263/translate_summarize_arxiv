    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions , anisotropic flow describes the collective motion of particles with respect to the reaction plane , and it is conventionally characterized  @xcite by fourier coefficients v_n = n ( - ) [ vndef ] where @xmath4 denotes the azimuthal angle of an outgoing particle , @xmath5 is the orientation of the reaction plane , and @xmath6 denotes the harmonic .",
    "so far three such coefficients are found finite at rhic , namely , directed flow @xmath0 , elliptic flow @xmath7 and 4@xmath8 order harmonic flow @xmath9 .",
    "this paper will focus on the directed flow , the first fourier coefficient .",
    "directed flow describes the sideward motion of fragments in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions , and it carries early information from the collision  @xcite .",
    "the shape of directed flow at midrapidity is of special interest because it might reveal a signature of a possible phase transition from normal nuclear matter to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "it is argued that directed flow , as a function of rapidity , may exhibit a flatness at midrapidity due to a strong , tilted expansion of the source .",
    "such expansion gives rise to anti - flow  @xcite or a 3@xmath10 flow  @xcite component .",
    "the anti - flow ( 3@xmath10 flow component ) is perpendicular to the source surface , and is in the direction that is opposite to the direction of the bouncing - off motion of nucleons .",
    "if the tilted expansion is strong enough , it can even overcome the bouncing - off motion and results in a negative @xmath3 slope at midrapidity , producing a wiggle - like structure . in  @xcite",
    ", it is emphasized that proton @xmath0 can serve as a probe for the first order phase transition , as calculation shows that proton @xmath3 does not show negative slope for a hadronic equation of state ( eos ) without a qgp phase transition .",
    "note that although the calculation is done with a first order phase transition at sps energies , the direct cause of the negative slope is the strong , tilted expansion , which is also relevant at top rhic energies .",
    "a wiggle structure is also seen in rqmd  @xcite , and it is attributed to the baryon stopping and positive space - momentum correlation . in this picture , no phase transition is needed , and pions and nucleons flow in opposite directions . to distinguish between baryon stopping and anti - flow associated with a phase transition , it is desirable to measure the @xmath3 for identified particles and compare the signs of their slope at midrapidity .",
    "the centrality dependence of proton @xmath3 may have implications for a possible first order phase transition .",
    "it is expected that in very peripheral collisions , protons flow in the same direction as spectators . in mid - central collisions , if there is a phase transition , the proton @xmath3 slope at midrapidity may change sign and become negative .",
    "eventually the slope diminishes in central collisions due to the symmetry of collisions .    at low energies ,",
    "it is shown by the e895 collaboration  @xcite that k@xmath11 has a negative @xmath3 slope around midapidity , while lambda and protons have positive slope  @xcite .",
    "it is explained by a repulsive kaon - nucleon potential and attractive lambda - nucleon potential .",
    "the na49 collaboration  @xcite has measured the @xmath0 for pions and protons , and negative @xmath3 slope is observed by the standard event plane method .",
    "the three particle correlation method @xmath12 , which is believed to be less sensitive to non - flow effects , gives negative slope too , but with larger statistical error . at top rhic energies",
    ", @xmath0 has been studied for charged particles by both the star and the phobos collaborations  @xcite .",
    "it is found that @xmath0 in the forward region follows the limiting fragmentation hypothesis well , and @xmath13 depends only on the incident energy , but not on the size of the colliding system at a given centrality .",
    "the system size independence of @xmath0 can be explained by hydrodynamic calculation with an titled initial condition  @xcite .",
    "the systematic study of @xmath0 for identified particles at rhic did not begin until recently because it is more challenging for two reasons , 1 ) @xmath0 for some identified particles ( for example , protons ) is much smaller than that of charged particles , thus is more difficult to measure , 2 ) it demands more statistics to measure @xmath0 for identified particles other than poins .",
    "in this analysis we used 62 million events for au + au collisions at @xmath2 gev , all taken by star s minimum bias trigger during rhic run 2007 .",
    "charged particles are identified by their energy loss inside star s time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite , and @xmath14 are reconstructed by their charged daughter tracks inside the tpc .",
    "track quality cuts are the same as used in  @xcite .",
    "the centrality definition of an event was based on the number of charged global tracks in the tpc with track quality cuts : @xmath150.5 , a distance of closest approach ( dca ) to the global vertex less than 3 cm , and 10 or more fit points .",
    "additional weight is assigned to each event in the analysis accounting for the bias in the vertex z direction , due to the inclusion of hits of silicon vertex tracker in tracking for year 2007 data production .",
    "in addition , the transverse momentum @xmath16 for protons are required to be larger than 400 mev@xmath17 , and dca are required to be less than 1 cm , in order to avoid the beam - pipe background .",
    "the same cut is applied to anti - protons as well to enssure a fair comparison with protons .",
    "the high end of the @xmath16 cut is 1 gev@xmath17 where protons and pions have the same energy loss in the tpc and thus become indistinguishable .",
    "the event plane angle is determined from the sideward deflection of spectator neutrons measured by star s shower maximum detector at zero degree calorimeters ( zdcsmd ) , which are located close to beam rapidity and have the minimum contribution from non - flow .",
    "the description of measuring @xmath0 using the zdcsmd event plane can be found in  @xcite .",

    "errors in this plot ( and other data figures in this paper ) are statistical only .",
    "systematical uncertainties are studied by varying track quality cuts , and are found to be negligible .",
    "calculations from rqmd and qgsm are scaled by a factor of 2.5 and 0.18 , respectively . following convention ,",
    "the sign of spectator @xmath0 in the forward region is chosen to be positive , to which the measured sign of @xmath0 for particles of interest is only relative .",
    "the pion @xmath3 result follows closely to the published charged particle result  @xcite and it shows a negative slope at midrapidity .",
    "most models either predict the wrong sign of pion @xmath0 or the wrong magnitude by a signifiant factor   winter workshop on nuclear dynamics , it is shown that the directed flow of charged particles can be explained by hydrodynamic calculation with a tilted initial condition . ] , which indicates that it is a challenging job to understand the dynamics happening at early stages . in this sense",
    "the measurement presented in this paper will offer strong constraints on models .",

    "pions are the dominant particles produced and they carry the flow of the bulk .",
    "it is not a surprise to see that anti - protons , also as produced particles , follow the flow direction of pions .",
    "they both have negative slope at midrapidity , which is consistent with the anti - flow picture .",
    "@xmath3 of protons , however , exhibits a flatter shape than others .",
    "the mass difference between protons and pions can not explain the flatness of proton @xmath3 because the anti - protons have the same mass as that of protons , yet they flow close to pions .",
    "indeed , the observed @xmath0 for protons is a convolution of directed flow of produced protons with that of transported protons , and the flatness of inclusive proton @xmath3 around midrapidity can be explained by the negative flow of produced protons being compensated by the positive flow of protons transported from spectator rapidity , as a feature expected in the anti - flow picture .",
    "charged kaon ( up triangles ) and @xmath1 ( down triangles ) @xmath0 as a function of rapidity for 10 - 70% au + au collisions at @xmath2 gev , pion @xmath3 ( empty stars ) is shown as a reference . ]",
    "[ fig : kaonv1 ] shows @xmath0 of kaon and @xmath1 as a function of rapidity , for centrality 10 - 70% .",
    "pion @xmath0 is also plotted for comparison .",
    "kaon @xmath0 is a unique measurement because the kaon / proton cross section is smaller than the pion / proton cross section , thus its directed flow is less likely to be `` induced '' by the shadowing effect .",
    "the plot shows that both kaon and @xmath1 have negative @xmath0 slope , which means that the observed @xmath0 is not likely to be caused by the shadowing effect .    on the other hand , anti - flow has difficulties in explaining the centrality dependence of @xmath0 , as shown by fig . [",

    "if there is an anti - flow due to the strong , tilted expansion , one expects such an effect is larger in mid - central collisions than that in peripheral collisions . as a consequence , proton @xmath0 slope , which is expected to be positive in very peripheral collisions , will change its sign to negative in mid - central collisions and approach zero in central collisions . due to the large statistical error",
    ", we can not exclude the possibility that proton v1 can be positive in 70 - 80% central collisions .",
    "however , in 30 - 80% central collisions , proton @xmath0 slope is found mostly negative and the magnitude decreases with decreasing centrality . in more central ( 5 - 30% ) collisions ,",
    "proton @xmath0 slope becomes extremely small , while anti - proton @xmath0 slope remains negative and continues to follow that of charged particles ( mostly pions ) .",
    "anti - flow may cause a difference between @xmath0 of protons and anti - protons , and such difference is expected to be accompanied by strongly negative @xmath0 . in data , the large difference between proton and anti - proton @xmath0 is seen in 5 - 30% centrality , while strongly negative @xmath0 is found for protons , anti - protons and charged particles in a different centrality ( 30 - 70% ) .",

    "it changes its sign to negative as shown by the data point at @xmath25 gev , measured by na49 experiment . with previous measurements , which include only one point above @xmath24 gev",
    ", one can not conclude if proton @xmath0 slope continues to decrease or stays close to zero when energy increases , the addition of the data point from rhic indicates that proton @xmath0 slope remains close to zero at @xmath2 gev .",
    "judging over the broad energy range , the transition of the trend happens around @xmath24 gev , making it a discontinuous point , and interestingly , it coincides with the energy vicinity where @xmath26 exhibits a kink  @xcite . hopefully the on - going beam energy scan program will map out the region of interest with details .",
