    "_ fixed - target at approximately tev energies ? did nt we do that for over twenty years ending a decade ago ? why revisit that strategy ? _",
    "a renaissance in tev - energy fixed - target physics has become possible because of new detector technologies and improvements in accelerators since the 1990 s . as a result",
    ", we can describe a fixed - target physics program , focusing on the charm and neutrino sectors .",
    "the program is unique to a @xmath01  tev fixed - target facility and complements the ongoing physics program envisioned by the community for the late 2010 s .",
    "there are two possible sources of @xmath01  tev protons which may be available .",
    "the first is the tevatron at fermilab , which can be modified for fixed - target running .",
    "details on how this machine can be run at higher intensity and higher efficiency than in the past are discussed in appendix a of this paper .",
    "the second possible source is the sps+  @xcite which is planned at cern as part of the lhc upgrade program .",
    "the fixed - target program described here can run during times when the sps+ is not providing beam to lhc .",
    "the energy of sps+ is expected to be about 1  tev . for the results presented here ,",
    "we have assumed 800  gev protons on target since this is the capability of the existing machine",
    ". however , the physics case only improves for running at 1  tev .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the strength and richness of an envisioned fixed - target program . in particular",
    ", this paper concentrates on a new study of discovery potential in the charm sector , which would utilize slow - spill beams .",
    "a future @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing and violation ( ) experiment with three years of running could reconstruct an order of magnitude more flavor - tagged  decays than will be reconstructed by the @xmath3-factory experiments with their full data sets .",
    "the resulting sensitivity to  parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 is found to be much greater than current world sensitivity .",
    "however , to illustrate that this is a well - rounded program , we also explore ideas in the neutrino sector .",
    "we review the case for a precision electroweak neutrino experiment running from a very pure sign - selected high energy @xmath6 beam , which has been discussed in more detail elsewhere  @xcite and we present new studies on two promising and unique avenues for beyond standard model neutrino searches using beam dump production .",
    "the first of these uses @xmath7 charged current events produced by a proton beam in the 800  gev to 1  tev range .",
    "the second is a search for neutral heavy leptons produced in the beam dump . emphasizing the breadth of physics possible in the high - energy neutrino scattering sector of this new fixed target program , an extensive study of high - precision qcd",
    "is described in a separate paper  @xcite .",
    "this combination of experiments represents an integrated program aimed at discovery of new physics . at the same time",
    ", each of these experiments will provide a wide array of interesting and valuable measurements within the standard model .",
    "the program is very physics rich and will provide opportunities for many physicists .",
    "the result is a compelling opportunity for the future .",
    "as mentioned , there was a very successful fixed - target charm program at the fermilab tevatron  @xcite .",
    "not only did it provide high precision measurements ( some of which remain the most precise even today ) , but it also advanced flavor physics thinking in a way that still underlies many current analyses .",
    "it also demonstrated the utility of precision vertexing for heavy flavor physics , paving the way for the incorporation of silicon tracking systems in all the latest experiments .",
    "the fixed - target charm program ended when the applied technologies were more - or - less played out , and attention turned to the opportunities at colliders , both at @xmath8 and hadron machines .",
    "the reason to now revisit the possibility of a fixed - target charm experiment is a combination of increased interest in charm mixing ( now observed ) and possible  in the charm system , and the availability of technology well beyond what was available at the end of the previous program  @xcite .",
    "a tevatron fixed - target experiment may be the most cost - effective way forward in the charm sector , as the tevatron would not need to be run in collider mode . also , the beam energy could be reduced and still remain far above charm production threshold .",
    "such an experiment at the tevatron has the potential to greatly improve upon the sensitivity to mixing and  achieved by the b factories .",
    "we note that the most sensitive measurements of mixing and  rely on measuring decay - time distributions . for this type of measurement",
    ", a fixed - target experiment has an advantage over an @xmath8 @xmath3 factory experiment due to the fact that the mean decay length is notably larger than the vertex resolution .",
    "we will address these physics opportunities below .",
    "in the recent `` roadmap for us high - energy physics '' written by the particle physics project prioritization panel ( p5 ) , future operation of the tevatron was not considered .",
    "however , there exists a plan to keep the tevatron cold after completion of the collider program such that it could easily be operated again should sufficiently compelling physics opportunities arise .",
    "0.30 in    a fermilab tevatron fixed - target experiment could produce very large samples of @xmath9 mesons that decay via @xmath10  .",
    "the decay time distribution of the `` wrong - sign '' @xmath11 decay is sensitive to @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing parameters @xmath12 and  @xmath13 .",
    "additionally , comparing the @xmath1 decay time distribution to that for @xmath2 allows one to measure or constrain the  parameters @xmath4 and @xmath14 .",
    "this method has been used previously by fermilab experiments e791  @xcite and e831  @xcite to search for @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing .",
    "however , those experiments ran in the 1990 s and reconstructed only a few hundred flavor - tagged @xmath11 decays . technological advances in vertexing detectors and electronics made since then",
    "make a much improved fixed - target experiment possible .",
    "we estimate the expected sensitivity of such an experiment , and compare it to that of the @xmath3 factory experiments  and .",
    "those experiments have reconstructed several thousand signal decays and using these samples , along with those for , have made the first observation of @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing  @xcite .",
    "the cdf experiment has also measured @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing using @xmath11 decays  @xcite .",
    "although the background is much higher than at an @xmath8 experiment , the number of reconstructed signal decays is larger , and the statistical errors on the mixing parameters are similar to those of .",
    "although we focus on measuring @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , a much broader charm physics program is possible at a tevatron experiment .",
    "we also briefly present some of these other opportunities .",
    "we estimate the expected signal yield by scaling from two previous fixed - target experiments , e791 at fermilab and  at desy .",
    "these experiments had center - of - mass energies and detector geometries similar to those that a new charm experiment at the tevatron would have",
    ".      took data with various trigger configurations .",
    "one configuration used a minimum - bias trigger , and from this data set the experiment reconstructed @xmath17 @xmath9-tagged `` right - sign '' @xmath18 decays in @xmath19 hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "this yield was obtained after all selection requirements were applied . multiplying this rate by the ratio of doubly - cabibbo - suppressed to cabibbo - favored",
    "decays @xmath20",
    "@xcite gives a rate of reconstructed , tagged  decays per hadronic interaction of @xmath21 . to estimate the sample size",
    "a tevatron experiment would reconstruct , we assume the experiment could achieve a similar fractional rate .",
    "if the experiment ran at an interaction rate of 7  mhz ( which was achieved by  using a two - track trigger configuration ) , and took data for @xmath22 live seconds per year , then it would nominally reconstruct @xmath23 flavor - tagged  decays per year , or 192000 decays in three years of running .",
    "here we have assumed a trigger efficiency of 50% relative to that of  , which is a simple estimate : the trigger needs to be more restrictive than the minimum - bias configuration of , but , on the other hand , the technology has advanced since   was designed and the trigger latency and other inefficiencies should be substantially reduced .",
    "fermilab e791 was a charm hadroproduction experiment that took data during the 1991 - 1992 fixed - target run .",
    "the experiment ran with a modest transverse - energy threshold trigger , and it reconstructed 35 @xmath9-tagged  decays in @xmath24 hadronic interactions  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a rate of @xmath25 reconstructed decays per hadronic interaction . assuming a future tevatron experiment achieves this fractional rate , one estimates a signal yield of @xmath26 per year , or 207000 in three years .",
    "this value is similar to that obtained by scaling from .",
    "we have assumed the same trigger+reconstruction efficiency as that of e791 .",
    "we note that e791 had an inactive region in the middle of the tracking stations where the @xmath27 beam passed through , and a future tevatron experiment could avoid this acceptance loss .",
    "we do not include any improvement for this in our projection .",
    "we compare these yields with those that will be attained by the @xmath3 factory experiments after they have analyzed all their data .",
    "the  experiment reconstructed 4024 @xmath9-tagged  decays in 400  of data  @xcite , and it is expected to record a total of 1000  when it completes running .",
    "this integrated luminosity corresponds to 10060 signal events .",
    "the  experiment reconstructed 4030 tagged  decays in 384  of data  @xcite , and the experiment recorded a total of 484  when it completed running in early  2008 .",
    "thus the total  data set corresponds to 5080 signal events . adding this to the estimated final yield from   gives a total of 15100  decays .",
    "this is less than 8% of the yield estimated for a tevatron experiment in three years of running .",
    "the kek - b accelerator where  runs is scheduled to be upgraded to a `` super-@xmath3 '' factory running at a luminosity of @xmath28  @xmath29s@xmath30  @xcite .",
    "there is also a proposal to construct a super-@xmath3 factory in italy near the i.n.f.n .",
    "frascati laboratory  @xcite .",
    "an experiment at either of these facilities would reconstruct very large samples of @xmath31 decays .",
    "in fact the resulting sensitivity to @xmath32 and @xmath33 may be dominated by systematic uncertainties . this merits further study .",
    "we note that many of the systematic errors obtained at a future tevatron experiment are expected to be smaller than those at an @xmath8 collider experiment , due to the superior vertex resolution and @xmath34 identification possible with a forward - geometry detector .",
    "the lhcb experiment has a forward geometry and is expected to reconstruct @xmath31 decays in which the @xmath9 originates from a @xmath3 decay . the resulting sensitivity to mixing parameters",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 has been studied in ref .",
    "this study assumes a @xmath35 cross section of 500  @xmath36b and estimates several unknown trigger and reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "it concludes that approximately 58000 signal decays would be reconstructed in 2  of data , which corresponds to one year of running .",
    "this yield is similar to that estimated for a tevatron experiment .",
    "however , lhcb s trigger is efficient only for @xmath37 mesons having high @xmath38 , _ i.e. _ those produced from @xmath3 decays .",
    "this introduces two complications :    1",
    ".   some fraction of prompt @xmath39 decays will be mis - reconstructed or undergo multiple scattering and , after being paired with a random soft pion , will end up in the  sample ( fitted for @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "as the production rate of prompt @xmath37 s is @xmath40two orders of magnitude larger than that of @xmath3 s , this component may be non - negligible , and thus would need to be well - understood when fitting .",
    "2 .   to obtain the @xmath9 vertex position ( _ i.e. _ the origin point of the @xmath1 ) , the experiment must reconstruct a @xmath41 vertex , and the efficiency for this is not known .",
    "monte carlo studies indicate it is 51%  @xcite , but there is uncertainty in this value .",
    "the lhcb study found that , for @xmath42 , a signal - to - background ratio ( @xmath43 ) of 0.40 , and a decay time resolution ( @xmath44 ) of 75  fs , the statistical errors obtained for @xmath32 and @xmath33 were @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "these values are less than half of those that we estimate can be attained by the @xmath3 factories by scaling current errors by @xmath47 : @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "as the signal yield , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 of a future tevatron experiment are similar to those for lhcb , we expect that similar errors for @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be attained .",
    "the cdf measurement of charm mixing  @xcite uses 12700 @xmath31 decays from 1.5  of integrated luminosity .",
    "this could increase by about a factor of five by the end of run ii at the tevatron collider . assuming that both statistical and systematic errors are reduced by the square root of the anticipated increase in luminosity , one estimates errors of @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , at the end of run ii . to compare to these estimates",
    ", we have done a `` toy '' monte carlo ( mc ) study to estimate the sensitivity of a tevatron experiment .",
    "the results obtained are similar to those of lhcb : for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56  fs , and a minimum decay time cut of @xmath57 ( to reduce combinatorial background ) , we find @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "these errors are the rms s of the distributions of residuals obtained from fitting an ensemble of 200 experiments .",
    "a typical fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toymc_fit ] .    note that it is difficult to know when a tevatron charm experiment might be performed and results available .",
    "that makes it challenging to say what may be the world situation by the time such an experiment is done .",
    "the point of this paper is to say what such an experiment might achieve .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     preliminary scanning of simulated nc and cc @xmath60 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 events up to 300  gev , based on a microboone - like lartpc with 3 mm wire spacing , verifies the viability of the technology to meet the physics goals of the proposed experiment .",
    "distinct electromagnetic showers from electrons and photons , tracks from muons , pions , kaons , protons , as well as displaced vertices due to ( _ e.g. _ ) photon conversion , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , are clearly evident , facilitating the identification of individual particles and resonances .",
    "example simulated @xmath7 cc events are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nutau_tauenunu_evd ] and  [ fig : nutau_taurhonu_evd ] , demonstrating the expected resolution and pattern of energy deposition hits from typical interactions .",
    "this position and calorimetric resolution is absolutely necessary in order to kinematically reconstruct a charged @xmath63 from its decay products .",
    "the concept of adding a magnetic field to a lartpc has recently been proposed , with bench tests of its practicality performed on small detectors  @xcite .",
    "this project may offer the first step at deploying the technology at the kiloton scale .",
    "if a magnetic field is employed within the tpc , charge - sign identification is possible , which will reduce the combinatorial background in kinematically reconstructing @xmath7 charged current interactions , allow separate @xmath7 and @xmath64 measurement , provide a method of observing potential direct  in neutrino and charged @xmath63 interactions , and provide a second method of track momentum / energy determination especially useful for events with exiting tracks .",
    "one of the major concerns with lartpc technology is lar purity , with current technology limiting charge drift distance to less than 2 - 3  m. the neutrino events at the @xmath65(100  gev ) scale will be very forward boosted , such that the lartpc s drift distance can be short relative to the beam - coordinate .",
    "therefore , sufficient lar purity may be attained with existing purification technology , even for a kiloton - scale detector , at the expense of additional readout planes or a smaller modular geometry .",
    "combining the increased flux of protons delivered by the proton source ( _ e.g. _ the fnal tevatron ) with the use of a lartpc detector with a mass @xmath66 times that of donut s 0.5  ton as well as twice the running time , will result in a delivered flux observed at the detector approximately @xmath67 that observed by donut over its six - month run , equivalently @xmath68(6 million ) @xmath7 charged current interactions with one year of data .",
    "here we highlight the prospects for measuring charged and neutral current @xmath69matter scattering , observing @xmath69electron scattering and probing electromagnetic properties of the tau neutrino . in the standard model ,",
    "@xmath69 charged current interactions are mediated by @xmath70-boson exchange .",
    "there is only one measurement ( with error bars around 50% ) of the charged - current scattering cross - section with initial - state tau neutrinos  @xcite , and it agrees with standard model expectations .",
    "the expectations are that the @xmath71 transitions are well - described by the standard model thanks to abundant data on @xmath63 lepton processes , including @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath74+hadrons , @xmath75 , etc .",
    "the measurement precision of @xmath7 charged - current events is of the utmost importance as it provides a normalization for neutral - current measurements , which are only very poorly constrained .",
    "furthermore , a @xmath63-lepton sensitive neutrino detector may also place bounds on flavor - violating processes such as @xmath76 .",
    "even though these are already strongly constrained by the nomad experiment  @xcite , a @xmath7-rich beam might significantly improve on current bounds .    in the standard model , neutral current interactions",
    "are mediated by @xmath77 boson exchange . unlike charged - current processes",
    ", neutral current processes involving @xmath69 are only very poorly constrained , especially for interactions with final state @xmath69 and @xmath60  @xcite . in more detail , if we add to the standard model effective operators of the type ( see eq .",

    "@xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "a high statistics @xmath7-rich experiment should be able to significantly improve on current bounds or , perhaps , reveal new physics in the neutrino sector .",
    "finally , a high statistics experiment should also be sensitive to @xmath83-scattering events .",
    "these can be used ( see section on nusong ) to look for different manifestations of physics beyond the standard model . with a @xmath69-rich beam ,",
    "one can place bounds on what is usually referred to as the magnetic moment of the tau neutrino . in more detail ,",
    "one is sensitive to interactions of the type @xmath84f_{\\rho\\sigma } , \\label{eq : mu_tau}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the electromagnetic field - strength .",
    "the nature of the dimensionless coefficients @xmath87 depends on the nature of the neutrino fields ( majorana versus dirac ) and their magnitude is expected to be negligibly small in the absence of new physics beyond the standard model , which here is characterized by the new physics scale @xmath88 . what is referred to",
    "as the magnetic moment of a particular neutrino flavor is process dependent and involves different functions of the @xmath87 coefficients .",
    "while bounds on the @xmath60 and @xmath6 magnetic moments are presently many orders - of - magnitude better than that of @xmath7 , it is clear that the information one can acquire with a next - generation @xmath7 experiment is independent from and possibly competitive with measurements previous obtained with @xmath60 and @xmath6 scattering ( even if neutrinos are majorana fermions and the appropriate matrix of @xmath87-coefficients is anti - symmetric ) .",
    "the proposed @xmath7 experiment is wholly complementary to a next - generation program measuring @xmath60 and @xmath6 scattering , such as nusong .",
    "astrophysics also provides some stringent flavor - independent bounds , but these are often model dependent and need to be confirmed by terrestrial experiments .",
    "finally , we note that other electromagnetic properties of the tau neutrino can be probed by neutrino electron scattering ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    additionally , an intense @xmath7-rich neutrino beam offers a potentially large sample of highly polarized single charged @xmath63 leptons which may be uniquely exploited to measure the charged @xmath63 anomalous magnetic moment form factor as well as the  electric dipole moment .",
    "this sample of neutrino - produced single @xmath63 s may also provide an independent measurement of other @xmath63 properties in an environment with very different systematic uncertainties than those of the electron - positron collider experiments where the vast majority of @xmath63 physics has been studied in the last three decades .",
    "the combination of lartpc s fast triggering , high spatial and energy resolution , and particle identification by specific ionization energy loss allows a rich program of neutrino physics .",
    "the primary measurement of this experiment will be the high precision relative cross section measurement , @xmath89 , for charged current interactions of @xmath60 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 neutrinos , which provides a sensitive test of the standard model as outlined in the previous section .",
    "when combined with measurements / limits from nusong or current limits on the magnetic moment of @xmath6 and @xmath60 , similar searches for events consistent with neutrino magnetic moment interactions in a @xmath7-rich beam can provide sensitivity to the @xmath7 magnetic moment comparable to the present limits for @xmath60 and @xmath6 .    despite the much smaller sample of @xmath63 s as compared to present b - factories ( @xmath90 @xmath63 s ) , the unique environment of this detector and production mechanism provide a very different set of systematic uncertainties which allow an interesting laboratory for the verification of virtually all @xmath63 properties , including branching fraction measurements as small as @xmath91 . for example , utilizing the sample of @xmath92 charged @xmath63 leptons resulting from @xmath7 charged current interactions with one year of exposure , several measurements of charged @xmath63 properties are also possible .",
    "in particular , due to the significant and predictable polarization of the single charged @xmath63 s produced by @xmath7 charged current interactions , this experiment is potentially much more sensitive to the anomalous magnetic moment form factor and  electric dipole moment of the charged @xmath63 than previous experiments .",
    "further neutrino physics which may be measurable in this detector includes exclusive cross section measurements , such as coherent - pion production in neutral current and charged current interactions as well as @xmath93 charged and neutral current interactions .",
    "the significant size and low energy threshold of the lartpc also allows measurement of solar neutrino rates as well as burst - supernova neutrino sensitivity out of time with the beam spill . the proximity of the detector to the surface , expected pointing resolution of reconstructed tracks , and the size of the detector will yield a significant rate of cosmic - ray induced muons offering a wealth of interesting potential opportunities ranging from the observation of climactic changes in the atmosphere to searching for point sources of cosmic rays and sensitivity to the solar magnetic field .",
    "though the @xmath7 has been assumed to exist for over thirty years , only nine @xmath7 charged current interactions have been observed directly .",
    "precision study of this particle and its interactions is clearly warranted in order to determine if its nature is as predicted by the standard model and provides a unique laboratory to search for new physics .",
    "the proposed program of neutrino and charged @xmath63 physics is broad enough to support a wide variety of studies alongside the primary studies of the electroweak interactions of the @xmath7 using @xmath94 larger sample of interactions than has been observed previously .",
    "the proposed 1  kt size of the lartpc for this experiment is a natural choice to achieve the desired physics goals while also providing an intermediate step in the development of the lartpc technology between microboone ( 100 t ) and dusel ( 5 + kt ) .",
    "the addition of a solenoidal field would significantly enhance the physics capabilities of the project while pioneering the technological advancement of coupling lartpcs with a magnetic field at the kiloton scale .",
    "singlet ( sterile ) neutrino states arise in models which try to implement massive ( light ) neutrinos in extensions of the standard model .",
    "three singlet states @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are associated with the three active neutrinos . in the original see - saw mechanism ,",
    "these new states have very large masses , but variations like the nmsm model  @xcite give them masses which are within reach of experimental searches .",
    "limits exist from laboratory experiments , but they extend to masses up to 450  mev , and apply to couplings with the @xmath60 or @xmath6",
    ". an upgraded tevatron machine could enlarge the domain of exploration in masses and couplings with the study of neutrinos coming from @xmath37 and @xmath3 decays .",
    "for the first time , mixings to the @xmath7 could be efficiently investigated .",
    "such a search can be envisaged in the beam - dump of the @xmath7 experiment .      if heavy neutrinos exist , they mix with active neutrinos through a unitary transformation .",
    "any neutrino beam will contain a fraction of heavy neutrinos at the level @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the mixing matrix element between the heavy state @xmath100 and the charged lepton , @xmath101 ( @xmath101 being @xmath102 or @xmath36 or @xmath63 ) . at low energy accelerators ,",
    "neutrinos are produced in @xmath103 and k decays . at higher energies , charm and beauty",
    "kinematically , the mass range allowed for the production of a heavy @xmath100 depends on the emission process",

    "kaons allow larger masses , up to 450  mev .",
    "@xmath37 decays extend the range to @xmath01.4  gev for @xmath102 and @xmath36 channels , ( but only to 180  mev for the @xmath63 channel ) , and @xmath3 decays to @xmath04.5  gev ( 3  gev for the @xmath63 channel ) .",
    "the flux of n accompanies the flux of known neutrinos at the level of @xmath98 .",
    "corrections to this straightforward result come from helicity conservation which applies differently here .",
    "for example , for massless neutrinos , it suppresses @xmath106 decays relative to @xmath107 decays .",
    "this is not true anymore for @xmath105 .",
    "phase space considerations have also to be taken into account .",

    "they will decay through purely weak interactions .",

    "decay modes also depend on the @xmath100 mass .",
    "as soon as the mass is greater than 1  mev , the first channel to open is @xmath109 . with increasing masses , new modes open , and one can obtain @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 . for higher mass states potentially produced in b decays , new modes become relevant .",

    "mixings can be equal or different in production and decay .",
    "thus , one tests 6 different combinations of mixings in principle .",
    "this has been attempted at cern by the low energy experiment ps191  @xcite with @xmath117 protons of 19  gev on target , or about @xmath118 neutrinos ( essentially all @xmath6 ) crossing an empty detector volume",

    "this allows the search of @xmath100 states with masses up to 4.5  gev , mixing in particular with the @xmath7 .",
    "since the limits vary as the square root of the accumulated neutrino flux , the number of protons on target has to be maximal .",
    "the experiment consists in detecting a decay vertex arising in an empty volume set in a neutrino beam and characterized by , in most cases , two charged tracks .",
    "the detector requires a decay volume as large as possible followed by a calorimeter . in principle , the search is better done at low energy .",
    "however , in order to extend the region of potential masses , one has to produce b s and this is only done at high energy .",
    "the advantage of an upgraded tevatron machine comes directly from the much increased luminosity available . if , instead of being done in a beam dump , the search is done in a neutrino beam , for example in parallel with nusong , the background coming from neutrino interactions is also substantially increased . in 12 m of air",
    "the number of interactions amounts to several 10000 events .",
    "charged current events will give a muon in the final state in 99% of the cases .",

    "[ fig : decayvolume ] .",
    "the background from interactions becomes manageable .",
    "a higher vacuum would require much more sophisticated techniques .",
    "a good spatial resolution plane is necessary between the decay volume and the calorimeter in order to precisely reconstruct the decay vertex .",
    "the best limits on couplings come from exclusive channels : @xmath111 and @xmath127 for low masses , @xmath128 and @xmath129 for intermediate masses , and @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 for higher masses .",
    "the decay channels involving @xmath102 and @xmath36 can be totally reconstructed .",
    "two essential constraints arise : 1 ) the reconstructed direction of arrival must point to the neutrino production target and 2 ) the invariant mass of the detected particles must reconstruct a fixed mass .",
    "for example , one can search for a @xmath134 .",
    "this means that the calorimeter must have the track reconstruction and identification capability .",
    "it must be fine grained and preferably come with a magnetic field .",

    "heavy neutral leptons arise in models which try to accommodate massive active neutrinos .",
    "searches have been done in low energy neutrino beams .",
    "the advantage of an upgraded high energy machine is two - fold : the high energy allows exploration in a larger domain of masses , up to the @xmath3 mass , and the high luminosity pushes down the limits .",
    "in particular , it can set meaningful limits on the practically unexplored couplings to the @xmath63 .",
    "the fascinating possibility of finding sterile neutrinos could be uniquely tested in such an experiment .",
    "this paper presents examples of the compelling physics that can result from a @xmath01  tev fixed target facility .",
    "we have especially highlighted the discovery potential in the charm sector , which would utilize slow - spill beams .",
    "we also considered forefront physics in the neutrino sector .",
    "we reviewed an existing idea for precision electroweak studies . also , we presented two new promising and unique avenues for beyond standard model neutrino searches using beam dump production .",
    "the first of these uses @xmath7 charged current events which are produced above threshold by a proton beam in the 800  gev to 1  tev range .",
    "the second is a search for neutral heavy leptons produced in the beam dump .",
    "this combination of experiments represents an integrated program aimed at discovery of new physics which is complementary to other approaches under discussion for the future .",
    "previous 800  gev fixed - target operation of the tevatron ran with a maximum throughput of roughly 25 - 28 @xmath142 protons ( 25 - 28  tp ) per pulse every 60  sec with a duty cycle of roughly 33 - 40% .",
    "the beam was shared , over a 20 - 23  sec flat - top period , between slow spill experiments and neutrino experiments which required fast extracted beams . to meet the demands of nusong",
    ", the facility needs to be able to deliver approximately @xmath143 protons on target over five years of running at 66% overall operation efficiency per year .",
    "this translates to an average particle delivery rate during running of about 1.8  tp / sec . assuming that only a 40  sec ramp will be required for nusong",
    ", each ramping of the tevatron would need to deliver about 75  tp , more than 2.5  times the previous record intensity .",
    "the subsections below address some of the major issues regarding re - institution of a tevatron fixed - target program , and issues associated with meeting the above intensity demand .",
    "the original tevatron fixed - target program ran at 800  gev and stress and strain on the superconducting magnets was a major issue early in the program .",
    "issues with lead restraints within the cryostat were eventually identified and all dipole magnets were repaired in the tunnel in the late 1980 s . since that time , the tevatron has been able to average over 250,000 cycles between failures of dipole magnets  @xcite .",
    "this `` rate '' includes failures of collider - specific magnets , such as low - beta quadrupoles .",
    "note that a neutrino program which demands @xmath143  pot , using a synchrotron that delivers 75  tp every cycle , requires about 2.7 million cycles  thus , on the order of 10 failures could be expected during the course of the experiment .",
    "once the fixed - target operation was halted and only collider operation was foreseen , the capability to repair and rebuild tevatron magnets was greatly reduced at the laboratory . however , assuming no need for building new magnets from scratch , capabilities still exist to perform repairs and , along with the given inventory of spare tevatron magnets and corrector packages , a multi - year fixed - target operation consistent with the above is sustainable from this aspect  @xcite .",
    "ramp rate studies of tevatron dipole magnets have been performed , and rates of 200 - 300  a / sec can be maintained at 4.6@xmath144  k without quenching  @xcite .",
    "the current power supply system can still perform at this level . to increase reliability , however , some ps system components may need to be upgraded .",
    "additionally , the tevatron rf system is still capable of running in the fixed - target state , though beam loading effects and appropriate compensation will need to be investigated for the anticipated higher intensity operation .",
    "two main injector ( mi ) pulses would be used to fill the tevatron . at 3  sec per 150",
    "gev mi cycle , this constitutes a 15% impact on other mi demands .",
    "the record intensity extracted from the tevatron in a cycle at 800 gev was almost 30  tp in 1997 , though 20 - 25  tp was far more typical . at that time",
    ", the bunch length during acceleration would shrink to the point where a longitudinal instability at higher energies ( @xmath0600 gev ) , resulting in aborts and sometimes quenches .",
    "this was compensated as well as possible with `` bunch spreading '' techniques ( blowing up the emittance via rf noise sources ) .",
    "today , the main injector is capable of providing greater than 40  tp per pulse , which could , in principle , fill the tevatron to 80  tp .",
    "many improvements to the tevatron beam impedance have been made during run ii , including , for example , reduction of the lambertson magnet transverse impedances which were identified as major sources .",
    "additionally , advances in rf techniques / technology and damper systems , _ etc_. , may allow , with enough studies and money , much better compensation of these effects , if required .",
    "this is a primary r&d point , if intensities near 75  tp are to be realized in the tevatron .      returning",
    "the tevatron to fixed - target operation would require the re - installation of the extraction channel in the a0 straight - section from which beam would be transported to the existing switchyard area and on to the experimental target station .",
    "the electrostatic septa were located at the d0 straight section and could straightforwardly be reinstalled in the original configuration .",
    "all of this equipment is currently in storage and available for use .",
    "the b0 straight section , currently housing the cdf detector , would be replaced with standard long straight section optical components .",
    "thus , the higher heat leak elements presently installed in the b0 and d0 regions would be absent , requiring less demands from the cryogenics system .",
    "the other necessary piece of hardware is the slow - spill feedback system , referred to as `` qxr '' which employs fast air - core quadrupoles installed at warm straight sections in the tevatron for fast feedback tune adjustment during the resonant extraction process .",
    "again , this equipment mostly still exists , though it may be desirable to perform a low - cost upgrade to modernize some electronic components .",
    "the neutrino experiment being discussed has requested `` pinged '' beam , short bursts of particles brought about by the qxr system .",
    "nusong will likely require tens of _ pings _ per cycle , during an assumed 1 sec flat - top .",
    "resonant extraction is an inherently lossy process , on the scale of 1 - 2% , determined by the particle step size across the thin electrostatic septum wires . historically , loss rates were tolerable with between 20 - 30  tp extracted over 20 sec .",
    "pings , each lasting on the scale of 1 - 2  ms with approximately 5  tp per ping  and sometimes higher  were extracted routinely for the tevatron neutrino program .",
    "thus , 15 or more such pings over a 1  sec flat top should be straightforward .",
    "alternative methods for fast extraction could be contemplated , though perhaps at a price .",
    "for instance , if an appropriate rf bunching scheme ( using a 2.5  mhz rf system , for example ) can be employed to prepare bunches spaced by 400  ns , then a fast kicker magnet system might be able to extract 50 such bunches one - by - one to the switchyard , a much cleaner extraction process . spreading the beam across fewer , longer bunches may also help to mitigate coherent instability issues .",
    "this opens up another possible r&d point to pursue . to set the scale , the highest intensity extracted in a single pulse ( _ i.e. _ not during a slow spill ) without quenching the tevatron was about 10  tp  @xcite .",
    "( also , this was a test , not a normal operational procedure . )",
    "the exact method used for 800  gev operation would be a point closely negotiated between the laboratory and the experiment(s ) using the beam .",
    "both resonant extraction and kicker methods should be feasible within reasonable constraints .",
    "the abort system used during high intensity fixed - target operation was located at c0 and was capable of absorbing 1  tev proton beams at 30  tp , repeatedly every `` several '' seconds , to the abort dump .",
    "while not used in collider operation , this beam dump and beam delivery equipment near the c0 straight section is still available and still accessible , and requires re - installation of extraction devices and their power supplies . the ultimate parameters of the neutrino experiment being discussed pushes the beam stored energy from about 3.5  mj ( 27  tp at 800  gev ) toward 10  mj .",
    "the design limits of this system would need to be re - examined , and the implications and environmental impact of re - establishing this area as the primary abort must be looked at carefully .",
