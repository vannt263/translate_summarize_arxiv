    "among a large variety of random walk and primordial noise models / choices , a distinguished role is played by heavy - tailed symmetric lvy - stable distributions , commonly thought to be an exclusive support for so - called lvy flights .",
    "that view is founded on the concept of independent and identically - distributed random variables of the jump - type and a broad class of infinitely divisible distributions , that are admitted by generalizing the familiar central limit theorem , as encoded in the lvy - khintchine formula .",
    "stable densities generically have no second moments .",
    "the response of lvy noise to external potentials is most often quantified by means of the langevin equation with an additive lvy ( stable ) driver .",
    "the affiliated distribution functions ( pdfs ) obey so - called fractional fokker - planck equations where , in order to handle heavy - tailed pdfs , the ( brownian case ) second spatial derivative is replaced by the fractional one of order @xmath3 , c.f . @xcite-@xcite and references therein . under confining conditions , the second moments of resultant pdfs may exist and then the temporal behavior of the variance may be employed to quantify ( on suitable time scales ) sub- , or super - diffusive features of the underlying jump - type dynamics .    in our previous papers @xcite we have noticed that in addition to standard langevin equation based methods , an alternative modeling approach is worth investigation .",
    "it is based on the concept of the lvy - schrdinger semigroup - driven dynamics , @xcite .",
    "contrary to the familiar ( in the context of the brownian motion ) mapping of the fokker - planck equation into the hamiltonian dynamical system , the non - gaussian case makes a distinction between these two dynamical patterns of behavior .",
    "they are inequivalent .",
    "our departure point was , and still remains , the `` stochastic targeting '' ( also named `` reverse engineering '' ) strategy , @xcite : given an invariant pdf @xmath4 , design a stochastic jump - type process for which that preselected density is a unique _ asymptotic _ target . in case of langevin - driven processes ,",
    "the basic reconstruction goal amounts to deducing the drift function of the process .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , given the very same @xmath4 , we have addressed the existence issue of a semigroup - driven dynamics ( e.g. the fractional version of the generalized diffusion equation ) , which relies on the existence of a semigroup potential @xmath5 . since @xmath4 is presumed to be shared with the langevin - driven lvy process , we know that it has a non - gibbsian functional form , @xcite .",
    "therefore standard thermalization and ( ultimate ) thermal equilibrium concepts are invalid in the lvy context .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have relaxed the common pdf constraint and addressed a fully fledged reconstruction problem for the semigroup dynamics : given an invariant pdf , identify the semigroup - driven lvy process for which the prescribed pdf @xmath6 may stand for a unique asymptotic one . since , to this end , there is no need to invoke the langevin connection , the ensuing non - gibbsian obstacle does not appear anymore .",
    "indeed , under new premises , asymptotic pdfs in the gibbs form are admissible and a class of jump - type processes , non - trivially responding to environmental inhomogeneities , becomes largely extended to pdfs that are definitely related to gibbsian thermal equilibria , @xcite .",
    "the last observation suggests a possibility of a major recasting of the original `` reverse engineering '' problem of ref .",
    "@xcite which was designed to handle jump - type processes only .",
    "namely , while before we have set common invariant pdfs for various jump - type processes , presently we shall consider invariant pdfs that are shared by , seemingly disparate , jump - type ( discontinuous ) and diffusion - type ( continuous ) processes .",
    "invariant pdfs that show up a power - law behavior ( being e.g. of the inverse polynomial form ) are here allowed and thus an issue of a proper thermalization framework ( gibbsian equilibria ) , that encompasses heavy - tailed distributions , reappears again .    an issue disregarded in the past",
    "@xcite is that generic lvy pdfs ( like e.g. the familiar cauchy distribution ) , plainly against casual views , may be embedded in suitable `` exponential families '' of pdfs @xcite . a careful exploitation of standard ( shannon )",
    "entropy extremum principles , @xcite , allows to single out a concrete lvy pdf as a specific exponential family member , at a uniquely defined inverse temperature value .",
    "anticipating further discussion , let us point out that our major observations are quite general and refer to a broad class of pdfs that are associated with symmetric stable noises and their perturbed ( confining regime ) versions .",
    "it is only an analytical and numerical tractability reason , that makes us mostly to refer to the cauchy driver in the present paper .",
    "we note that in the heavy - tailed asymptotic regime of diffusion - type processes , the process remains continuous and there is not ( albeit appealing ) `` switch '' to any jumping scenario . for all times",
    "we deal with a diffusion proceeding in conservative force fields , whose pdf asymptotic features ultimately appear to mimic those normally attributed to jump - type processes .    in a slightly careless manner one may think of a transition `` from a diffusive motion to the lvy flight behavior '' .",
    "the corresponding transient phenomena ( that have been literally interpreted as a transition from a diffusive to jump - type motion ) were experimentally recorded in the past @xcite .",
    "the diffusion vs jump scenario interpretation issue has appeared as well in the semiclassical description of so - called optical lattices , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite .",
    "apart from an obvious possibility to regard the lvy driver ( and thus to invoke the corresponding non - gaussian probability distribution ) as the major random displacement mechanism , it is perhaps less obvious that the wiener driver actually may give rise to heavy - tailed pdfs as well . then we encounter the dynamically generated intermediate and/or transitional regimes , where the number of the pdf moments asymptotically drops down to a finite number or none at all .    to elucidate these points , here we employ as a toy model ( albeit directly related to the previously mentioned optical lattice issue ) a one - parameter family of cauchy power pdfs , @xcite : @xmath7 as a reference exponential family of pdfs ( see e.g. @xcite ) that comprises the classic cauchy distribution as its member .",
    "this familiy is an exponential one due to a trivial transformatin into the gibbs - loking function with a logarthmic exponent .",
    "( actually , for each `` canonical '' lvy pdf an analogous exponential family embedding can be accomplished . )",
    "the above cauchy family arises naturally via the _ standard maximum entropy principle .",
    "namely , one seeks an extremum of the ( dimensionless ) shannon entropy @xmath8 of a continuous probability distribution @xmath9 under the constraint that the expectation value @xmath10 takes an a priori prescribed value , @xcite .",
    "_    if we regard a logarithmic function @xmath11 as an external force potential , with @xmath12 being interpreted as the forward drift in the langevin equation , then we end up with a familiar fokker - planck equation ( wiener driver in action ) .",
    "a functional form of the force term is identical to that of the physically motivated `` cooling force '' in optical lattice discussions @xcite . with",
    "that restoring force , we are capable of generating all members of the above cauchy family as target pdfs in the large time asymptotic of diffusion - type processes",
    ". this linear fokker - planck equation option has appeared in the literature before , @xcite , also in the attempt to interpret the cauchy family as a family of tsallis distribution functions @xcite .",
    "all members of the cauchy family can be achieved as asymptotic targets for jump - type processes .",
    "both the lvy - langevin and lvy semigroup driven dynamics may be employed to this end . in turn , the same `` targeting '' is valid if we resort to diffusion - type processes .",
    "an important intrinsic property of the cauchy family has to do with a number of moments of those pdfs .",
    "for a while , let us consider a parameter @xmath13 in eq .",
    "to assume integer values only : @xmath14 .",
    "then one immediately observes that the cauchy hierarchy of pdfs , c.f .",
    "[ fig : jed ] , involves a monotonically growing number ( as parameter @xmath15 grows from @xmath16 to infinity ) of moments of the probability distribution , beginning from none at all for @xmath16 .",
    "the growing number of moments in existence amounts to an improvement of the pdf localization and entails increasing strength of confinement of cauchy jumps ( e.g. flights ) , c.f .",
    "also @xcite , if the cauchy driver is assumed to be in action .    .",
    "]    an appealing feature of the cauchy family is that , even if looking exceptional in many respects , it has received an ample literature coverage not only in the semiclassical analysis of optical lattices @xcite-@xcite . in below",
    ", we shall elaborate a bit on another physically important context of tsallis entropies and related ( via entropy maximum principles ) tsallis pdfs .",
    "indeed , cauchy family pdfs were discussed in search for a statistical and thermal ( equilibrium ) foundation for tsallis entropies and associated with them probability distributions .",
    "that includes asymptotic properties of various fokker - planck equations , nonlinear being included , as a dynamical justification for them , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite . from a thermal equilibrium point of view",
    ", in reference to heavy - tailed pdfs , our approach appears to provide an alternative proposal to that originally formulated in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "subsequently we shall discuss in some detail various random motion scenarios that may generate the above cauchy family of pdfs in their large time asymptotics .",
    "after identifying the involved cauchy semigroup dynamics , we shall demonstrate that diffusion - type processes as well generate heavy - tailed ( cauchy , to be specific ) pdfs , in affinity with the case of jump - type processes described by fractional fokker - planck equations .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , it turns out that the conventional diffusive dynamics may be regarded as an alternative ( to the fractional one ) dynamical model of random behavior that produces non - gaussian pdfs .",
    "this includes heavy tailed ones , that are casually thought to arise exclusively in relation to `` free '' ( we stress the role of independent , identically distributed random displacements ) jump - type random motions .",
    "in fact , we demonstrate the validity of the diffusive relaxation scenario from an initial @xmath17 or a gaussian function to virtually _ any _ member of cauchy power pdf hierarchy . in the diffusive dynamics ,",
    "the resultant pdfs appear to have the gibbs - boltzmann form ( as should be for the exponential family of pdfs ) .",
    "all those observations readily extend to a broad variety of non - gaussian pdfs that have been invented in connection with the concept of confined lvy flights .",
    "our discussion uncovers an interplay between lvy and diffusion - type processes that has been left basically ignored in the current `` stochastic modeling '' literature .",
    "we point out that , in principle , one may even not be able to discriminate between these two classes ( continuous vs discontinuous ) of random processes , if in the vicinity of respective ( common for both ) equilibrium states",
    ". such observation may be particularly useful to avoid erroneous interpretation , in cases when an experimentally founded data analysis indicates a transient dynamics with a ( possibly unusual ) crossover behavior , like e.g. that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper langevin noises ( lvy and wiener driver alike )",
    "are considered as additive . for a completeness of exposition , we point out that there are reports in the literature that langevin equations with the multiplicative ( wiener ) noise do give rise to heavy - tailed distributions , see e.g. ref .",
    "an influential ref . @xcite appears to have harmed an open - minded approach to extremum entropy principles , with regard to heavy - tailed probability distribution functions .",
    "its main message has been often uncritically repeated : `` the derivation of distributions with inverse power tails from a maximum entropy formalism would be a consequence only of an unconventional auxiliary condition that involves the specification of the average value of a complicated function '' .",
    "this statement has been amplified at the end of section 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite : `` it is difficult to imagine that anyone in an a priori manner would introduce a set of auxiliary conditions that could yield the logarithmic term that appears in the ( shannon ) entropy function associated with the lvy distribution . '' in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pertinent formula ( their eq .",
    "( 7 ) ) is called the `` ad hoc constraint '' .",
    "a possible way out of this apparent difficulty has been proposed in the past .",
    "it amounts to abandoning the standard shannon entropy usage in extremum principles and deviate towards non - extensive generalizations of the notion of entropy ( effectively one ends up with a non - extensive thermostatistics ) , so that the heavy - tailed distribution would `` more or less naturally '' arise .",
    "that has been suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite and followed in the interpretation of experimental data in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite .",
    "we wish to demonstrate that the non - extensive proposal is _ not the only admissible route , if one looks for mechanisms that generate heavy - tailed target pdfs .",
    "the conventional shannon entropy strategy appears to work satisfactorily as well . _    if one seeks for an extremum of the shannon entropy @xmath18 of a continuous probability distribution ( @xmath19 is boltzmann constant and parameter @xmath20 determines the characteristic length of a system ) , under the constraint that the expectation value @xmath21 @xcite , an automatic outcome is a gauss density @xmath22 , where an ( implicit ) lagrange multiplier @xmath23 takes the value @xmath24 .",
    "finally , the presupposed gibbs thermal equilibrium condition imposes @xmath25 , @xcite .",
    "let us indicate that for generic gibbsian densities @xmath26 , where @xmath27 stands for an external potential and @xmath28 is a normalization factor , the previous moment constraint corresponding to the lagrange multiplier @xmath23 may readily be generalized to the form @xmath29 whose equivalent form is @xmath30 .",
    "so called `` ad hoc '' constraints of refs . @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "albeit with no reference to any effective potential , nor exponential ( gibbs - looking ) recasting of the involved pdfs , are nothing more than the demand @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for _ any a priori pre - selected lvy stable pdf .",

    "the preceding analysis shows that standard classification of anomalous diffusion processes as `` subdiffusions '' or `` superdiffusions '' on the basis of the exponent @xmath104 , is invalid in the presence of external forces .",

    "we have paid attention not only to random processes that have found their place in the literature , all stemming from different forms of langevin modeling ( here , only additive noise has been considered ) , but also to alternative jump - type scenarios based on the concept of the semigroup - driven dynamics , @xcite .",

    "we note that a traditional interpretation of random data relies on the existence of at least two lower moments of involved probability distributions .",
    "therefore , the case of lvy flights could have been placed within this interpretational paradigm only under confining conditions . in such case",

    "at this point we have passed to an approximation of the variance @xmath285 by the power law @xmath286 , with the hope that its validity would shed some light on the problem of assigning terms like `` subdiffusion '' or `` superdiffusion '' to anomalous transport processes .",

    "one can alternatively use incompatible microscopic mechanisms to model an engineered asymptotic approach to the same a priori prescribed non - gaussian target pdf .    if those pdfs are an outcome of a statistical analysis of experimental data , clearly a distinction between diffusive and jumping patterns of dynamical behavior appears not to be that sharp as commonly expected . on the other hand , a possible discrimination tool , e.g.",
    "the single - particle / molecule experiments in the nano- or mesoscopic domain should be set under scrutiny , since microscopic features of motion may not be verifiable at current levels of precision / resolution in collecting the data .",
    "the specific stochastic model that would seemingly fit to the data , might possibly be not more than a lucky guess , to be invalidated in a more thorough analysis .",
    "another message worth spelling is that apparently divorced dynamical mechanisms ( langevin - cauchy , cauchy semigroup and diffusion - type process ) may share common asymptotic pdfs .",
    "contrary to the wide - spread belief , heavy - tailed probability distributions , casually associated with jump - type processes , may as well have gaussian ( e.g. diffusive ) origins .",
    "that is possible if drift functions refer to properly functioning potentials , which we attribute to a cumulative effect of inhomogeneities of the environment ) .",
    "their role would be to _ attenuate the casually considered counterbalancing of the wiener driver , `` normally '' necessary to eliminate heavy tails of the resultant pdf .",
