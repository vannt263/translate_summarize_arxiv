    "the theory of bridges was developed by tutte in  @xcite in order to answer fundamental questions regarding graphs and their matroids , such as when a binary matroid is graphic .",
    "moreover , in his latest book  @xcite he expressed the belief that this theory is rich enough to enjoy more theoretical applications . in this work we use the theory of bridges to derive a decomposition result for binary signed - graphic matroids .",
    "the main result is the following theorem which states that deletion of a cocircuit naturally decomposes a binary signed - graphic matroid into minors which are all graphic apart from one which is signed - graphic , while these conditions are also sufficient for a binary matroid to be signed - graphic .",
    "let @xmath1 be a connected binary matroid and @xmath2 be a non - graphic cocircuit",
    ". then @xmath1 is signed - graphic if and only if :    * @xmath3 is bridge - separable , and * the @xmath3-components of @xmath1 are all graphic apart from one which is signed - graphic .",
    "this decomposition follows the lines of an analogous result for graphic matroids by tutte in  @xcite , however it differs in many ways mainly due to the more complex nature of cocircuits in signed - graphic matroids with respect to cocircuits in graphic matroids .",
    "signed - graphic matroids have attracted the attention of many researchers over the past years ( see  @xcite among others ) , while recently it has also been conjectured that they may be the building blocks of a @xmath0-sum decomposition of dyadic and near - regular matroids  @xcite .",
    "an overview of previous decomposition results regarding signed - graphic matroids and signed graphs can be found in  @xcite . however , the majority of the results presented in that work are mainly decomposition results for signed graphs rather than for signed - graphic matroids .",
    "specifically , based on previous results of pagano  @xcite and gerards  @xcite , the authors of  @xcite provide two main decomposition theorems for a signed graph @xmath4 ; one theorem concerning the case in which the associated signed - graphic matroid @xmath5 is binary and one theorem concerning the case in which @xmath5 is quaternary .",
    "the notion of @xmath0-sums of signed graphs is introduced by pagano in  @xcite while gerards introduces the similar notion of @xmath0-splits @xmath6 in order to provide decomposition results for signed graphs whose complete lift matroids are regular ( see  @xcite for a definition of the complete lift matroid of a signed graph ) . in  @xcite , these notions are slightly altered and extended so that the signed - graphic matroid of the @xmath0-sum of two signed graphs @xmath7 and @xmath8 will be equal to the matroidal @xmath0-sum of the associated signed - graphic matroid @xmath9 and @xmath10 . by using these @xmath0-sum operations of signed graphs and the results of  @xcite , the above mentioned decomposition theorems regarding the class of signed graphs with binary or quaternary matroids are proved in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way .",
    "section  [ sec_preliminaries ] presents all the necessary theory about graphs and matroids .",
    "bonds in signed graphs , which play a central role in this work , are classified in this section and the connection with the cocircuits in the corresponding signed - graphic matroid is made . in section  [ subsec_tangled_graphs ]",
    "we restrict ourselves to binary signed - graphic matroids and their graphical representations , tangled signed graphs .",
    "section  [ sec_decomposition ] is the main section of this paper , where the necessary structural theorems which provide the connection between a tangled signed graph and its corresponding matroid are presented .",
