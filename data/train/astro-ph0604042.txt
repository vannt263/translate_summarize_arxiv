    "black holes are a direct consequence of the physics described in einstein s theory of gravity .",
    "there is a great deal of indirect astronomical observational evidence for these exotic objects in two mass ranges : stellar mass black holes , with masses of 4 - 15 times the mass of our sun ; and supermassive black holes , with masses ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath2 solar masses .",
    "there is also some evidence for intermediate - mass black holes , those with masses of a few hundred to a few thousand solar masses ( see filippenko & ho 2003 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "since most nearby galaxies harbor supermassive black holes at their centers @xcite , the merging of galaxies , an essential part of the galaxy formation process , is thought to be the prevalent method in which supermassive black hole binaries are formed .",
    "accordingly , such systems should be common in galaxies .",
    "an understanding of the evolution and formation of these systems is important for an understanding of the evolution and formation of galaxies in general .",
    "the evolution of a binary supermassive black hole involves three stages @xcite , which are summarized by @xcite as follows : ( 1 ) as the galaxies merge , the supermassive black holes sink toward the center of the new galaxy via dynamical friction forming a binary ; ( 2 ) the binary continues to decay mainly due to the interaction of stars on orbits intersecting the binary , which are then ejected at velocities comparable to the binary s orbital velocity , carrying away energy and angular momentum ; ( 3 ) finally , if the binary s separation decreases to the point where the emission of gravitational waves becomes efficient at carrying away the last remaining angular momentum , the supermassive black holes coalesce rapidly .",
    "there is circumstantial evidence that most binary black holes merge in less than a hubble time @xcite .",
    "therefore , the most massive systems that are able to coalesce in less than a hubble time will create the loudest gravitational wave events in the universe @xcite , which might be detectable by a low - frequency gravitational wave experiment such as the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) .",
    "our ability to resolve both supermassive black holes in any given binary system depends on the separation between them , and on their distance from earth .",
    "it is believed that the longest timescales in the evolution of a supermassive binary black hole system leading up to coalescence is the stage in which the system is closely bound ( @xmath3 pc ) , meaning that in most of these systems the black hole pair can only be resolved by vlbi observations ( see review by komossa 2003a detailing observational evidence for supermassive black holes binaries ) . some source properties like x - shaped radio galaxies and double - double radio galaxies , helical radio - jets , double - horned emission line profiles , and",
    "semi - periodic variations in lightcurves have been taken as indirect evidence for compact binary black holes though other explanations are possible .",
    "the bl lacertae object oj 287 is a candidate for harboring a supermassive binary black hole , inferred from the characteristics of its optical lightcurve , which shows repeated outbursts at 11.86 y intervals @xcite . combining optical as well as radio observations",
    ", @xcite presented a new interpretation which suggests that at intervals of 11.86 y , the secondary black hole crosses the accretion disk of the primary black hole , causing a thermal flare visible only in the optical . about a year later , the disturbance propagates down the relativistic jet and results in the growth of new synchroton - emitting shocks visible both in the optical and radio . the observed 11.86 y period corresponds to the orbital period of the compact binary black hole .",
    "some wider systems have , however , been found more directly .",
    "the ultra luminous galaxy ngc 6240 , discovered by the chandra x - ray observatory , was found to have a pair of active supermassive black holes at its center @xcite , separated by a distance of 1.4 kpc .",
    "another system that has been known for some time is the double agn ( 7 kpc separation ) constituting the radio source 3c 75 , which was discovered by the vla to have two pairs of radio jets @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present further observations of the radio galaxy 0402 + 379 , which was discovered by @xcite to contain two central , compact , flat spectrum , variable components ( designated c1 and c2 ) , a feature which has not been observed in any other compact source .",
    "@xcite remarked upon the unusual properties found in this source and proposed several physical explanations .",
    "one possible scenario is for one component to be a foreground or background source , instead of being associated with 0402 + 379 .",
    "however , because of the small separation between c1 and c2 ( 7.3 pc ) , and because of a faint bridge of radio emission found connecting components c1 and c2 , this theory was ruled out .",
    "a second explanation was that the nucleus was being gravitationally lensed .",
    "however , based on the significant difference in the lightcurves of components c1 and c2 , and the close proximity of 0402 + 379 ( @xmath4 ) , this theory was also eliminated .",
    "two other scenarios were proposed by @xcite , which could not be conclusively ruled out and remained as possible explanations .",
    "the first of these suggest that component c2 could be a knot in the southern jet , with c1 classified as the core . to test this hypothesis we performed high frequency , high resolution very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations of 0402 + 379 , designed to resolve any jet component and to look for relative motions .",
    "the final explanation is that c1 and c2 are two active nuclei of a supermassive binary black hole system .    throughout this discussion , we assume h@xmath5=75 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , q@xmath5 = 0.5 , and 1 mas = 1.06 pc",
    "vlba observations were made on 2005 january 24 and june 13 at 0.317 , 4.976 , 8.410 , 15.354 , 22.222 , and 43.206 ghz .",
    "four ifs with a bandwidth of 8 mhz were observed in 32 channels in both r and l circular polarizations .",
    "four - level quantization was employed at all six frequencies .",
    "the net integration time on 0402 + 379 was 115 minutes at 0.3 ghz , 69 minutes at 5 ghz , 69 minutes at 8 ghz , 122 minutes at 15 ghz , 251 minutes at 22 ghz , and 249 minutes at 43 ghz .",
    "standard flagging , amplitude calibration , fringe fitting , bandpass calibration ( using 3c 84 for bandpass calibration and 3c 111 for gain calibration ) , and frequency averaging procedures were followed in the astronomical image processing system ( aips ; van moorsel et al .",
    "opacity corrections were performed for the 22 and 43 ghz data .",
    "aips reduction scripts described in @xcite were used for a large part of the reduction . all manual editing , imaging , deconvolution , and self - calibration",
    "were done using difmap @xcite .      to further study this source , we obtained fully - calibrated vlbi data taken in 1990 @xcite , in 1996 ( vcs ; beasley et al .",
    "2002 ) , in three epochs ( 1994 , 1996 , and 1999 ) of the cj proper motion survey ( britzen et al .",
    "2003 ) and in 2003 @xcite .",
    "these data were imaged and modeled in difmap to aid in analysis of motions , variability , and spectra of 0402 + 379 .",
    "further information regarding these observations can be found in table [ observations ] .",
    "observations were made with the gbt on 2005 october 14 .",
    "we used the 18 - 22 ghz k - band receiver , which uses dual beams separated by 3@xmath8 in azimuth .",
    "the gbt beamwidth is @xmath9 at 22 ghz , and pointing uncertainties were @xmath10 .",
    "pointing was corrected hourly using 0402 + 379 itself , which has sufficient continuum emission .",
    "the telescope was nodded between two positions on the sky such that one beam was always centered on the position of 0402 + 379 during integration .",
    "the spectrometer was configured with two bandpasses of 200 mhz each , overlapped by 20 mhz at the redshifted h@xmath7o frequency of 21.075 ghz , so that the total coverage was @xmath11 2700 km s@xmath6 with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy . the spectral resolution was equivalent to 0.33 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the zenith system temperature was between 40 and 55 k for the duration of the run .",
    "atmospheric opacity at 22 ghz was estimated from system temperature and weather data , and ranged from 0.09 to 0.12 at the zenith .",
    "the data were reduced using gbtidl .",
    "we found that the higher frequency if was subject to a 60 mhz ripple across the baseband , most likely the result of known imperfections and temperature sensitivities of the if transmission .",
    "to reduce the effects of the bandpass ripple we subtracted polynomials of order 4 and 8 from the first and second ifs respectively .",
    "we were left with some small residual ripples , but the period of 60 mhz is large enough that any maser emission present would have been apparent nonetheless .",
    "we hanning - smoothed the spectra following calibration .",
    "the 1@xmath12 rms sensitivity of these observations is @xmath132 mjy per km s@xmath6 .",
    "no maser emission was detected .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of the core of 0402 + 379 on 2004 december 11 with the 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ; ramsey et al 1998 ) marcario low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ; hill et al .",
    "two 600s exposures were taken , using the g3 vph grism , a schott og 515 blocking filter and a 1.5@xmath14 slit placed at the parallactic angle .",
    "the resulting spectrum covers @xmath15 @xmath16 at @xmath17 @xmath16 resolution .",
    "we applied standard iraf calibrations and find that the spectrum is similar to that obtained by @xcite , with a reddened continuum and seyfert 2 emission lines at a redshift of @xmath18 ( 16,460 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "in figure [ het_spectrum ] we show the h@xmath19 region of the spectrum , where the only strong lines are present .",
    "the lines are resolved with gaussian width @xmath20 @xmath16 , after deconvolution of the instrumental resolution . here",
    "the uncertainty is the range in the fitted linewidths for the various species ; this substantially exceeds the statistical error .",
    "the lines appear asymmetric with a red shoulder suggesting two components with a @xmath21 @xmath16 separation , i.e. a component velocity separation of @xmath22 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the residual to the line fit in figure [ het_spectrum ] also shows significant excesses in the line wings , suggesting the presence of a broader h@xmath19 component .",
    "optical imaging is at present quite limited , but in the palomar sky survey images 0402 + 379 appears as a relatively bright r = 17.2 elliptical galaxy embedded in a halo of patchy faint emission , extending to an apparent companion 25  to the ne .",
    "line emission ( oi & nii ) is seen from this region in the het spectra , suggesting the presence of disturbed photo - ionized gas .",
    "an optical image in @xcite also shows this faint emission .",
    "these authors comment that the elliptical core has a `` flat brightness distribution '' .",
    "the 2mass @xcite j@xmath23k color of 0402 + 379 is 1.757 , and this is consistent with the value expected for quasars at 0402 + 379 s redshift @xcite the j@xmath23k color could indicate star formation activity from a recent merger , or an obscured agn consistent with the radio galaxy identification for this source .",
    "additional optical imaging would be useful to understand the dynamical state of 0402 + 379 s core and the origin of the excitation of the surrounding nebulosity .",
    "a source appears near 0402 + 379 in the rosat bright source catalog @xcite .",
    "1rxsj040547.3 + 380308 gives 0.21 pspc cnts s@xmath6 .",
    "using the galactic absorption in this direction @xmath24 , and assuming a typical agn power law index of @xmath25 this corresponds to an unabsorbed 0.1 - 2 kev flux of @xmath26 or a luminosity @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 . the radio flux density of 0402 + 379 at 5 ghz is 1.1 jy @xcite which is a radio luminosity of @xmath29 ergs sec@xmath6 hz@xmath6 .",
    "this is in agreement with the x - ray to 5 ghz radio luminosity correlation of @xcite .",
    "the rosat archive also contains two hri pointings of this source for a combined exposure of 27 ks .",
    "these show that the x - ray source is largely resolved , extending over a radius of @xmath30 and appears to follow the faint diffuse emission surrounding the galaxy core .",
    "the bulk of the x - ray flux lies between the elliptical and its companion , further supporting the interaction hypothesis .",
    "the x - ray luminosity for this diffuse emission is comparable to the agn estimate above , e.g. @xmath31 for a @xmath32 kev raymond - smith plasma , and likely dominates the flux of the rosat all - sky survey source .",
    "we find that the x - ray emission of 0402 + 379 is unique ; of the 35 known cso s ( compact symmetric objects ) this is the only source detected in the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "thus , further x - ray observations could abet optical data in probing the nature of this emission and the connection with recent merger and/or nuclear activity .",
    "figure [ vlba05maps1 ] shows naturally weighted 0.3 and 5 ghz images from the 2005 vlba observations . the structure of the source at 5 ghz reveals the presence of two diametrically opposed jets , as well as two central strong components , one directly between the jets and the other one also between the jets but offset from the center .",
    "following the convention established by @xcite , we designated the aligned central component as c2 , and the offset central component as c1 . as we can see in figure [ vlba05maps1 ] , the 5 ghz image spans @xmath33 mas ( @xmath33 pc ) , corresponding to a small region in the central part of the 0.3 ghz image , which shows structure on scales of @xmath34 mas ( @xmath34 pc ) .",
    "the orientation of the 0.3 ghz image is consistent with that seen by the vla at 5 ghz @xcite .",
    "the vla image shows extended emission going northwards , whereas the northern jet seen in our 5 ghz image is pointing in the northeast direction , suggesting that at some point the jet changes direction and starts moving northwards , probably as a consequence of interactions with the surrounding medium .",
    "the vla 1.5 ghz image @xcite also shows the extended emission going northwards .",
    "the southern jet seen in our 5 ghz image is pointing in the southwest direction , which is consistent with both the 1.5 ghz and the 5 ghz vla images .",

    "the overall structure of the source is similar to that at 5 ghz , both jets are present as well as the two central components ( c1 and c2 ) .    it is clear that for higher frequencies the two central components are easily distinguished and remain unresolved , while both jets become fainter and are heavily resolved . at 22 ghz",
    "these effects are readily apparent , and become more prominent at 43 ghz , where the jets can barely be detected .",
    "before these observations were made , the highest frequency for which data had been taken for this source was 15 ghz .",
    "elliptical or circular gaussian components were fitted to the visibility data using difmap .",
    "we obtained an estimate for the sizes of c1 and c2 based on our 15 , 22 , and 43 ghz model fits . in this case",
    ", we fit circular gaussian components for both c1 and c2 , obtaining an average value of 0.173 @xmath11 0.045 mas or 0.183 @xmath11 0.048 pc for c1 , and 0.117 @xmath11 0.033 mas or 0.124 @xmath11 0.035 pc for c2 .      in order to explore questions pertaining to motion and variability in 0402 + 379",
    ", we obtained fully calibrated 5 ghz vlbi data taken in 1990 @xcite , as well as 5 ghz vlba data taken in three epochs ( 1994 , 1996 , and 1999 ) of the cj proper motion survey @xcite and in 2003 @xcite . combining these data with our 2005 observations at 5 ghz",
    ", we were able to probe motion and variability in this source over a time baseline of 15 y.    motion and variability studies were performed by fitting eight elliptical gaussian components in difmap to the 2003 visibility data .",
    "then , we used this model to fit the 5 ghz data corresponding to the 1990 , 1994 , 1996 , 1999 , and 2005 epochs .",
    "we let only position and flux density vary ; all other parameters were held fixed at the 2003 values .",
    "results from our fits are listed in table [ big_gaussian ] , and figure [ vlba05model ] shows the components model , where we have labeled each of them and we also added arrows showing the direction of motion of each component , which will be explained below .    to study component variability in 0402 + 379 , we compared the flux density for components c1 and c2 , the mean flux density of the southern components ( s1 , s2 , s3 , and s4 ) , and the mean flux density of the northern components ( n1 and n2 ) over each of our 6 epochs at 5 ghz .",
    "the above regions were chosen primarily on the basis of their isolation relative to other components in the source .",
    "errors for each region were computed on the basis of the rms noise and our estimated absolute flux calibration errors ( @xmath35 for the 1990 and 1994 mk ii vlbi epochs , and @xmath36 for the 1996 , 1999 , 2003 , and 2005 vlba epochs ) .",
    "the resulting fractional variation light curves are shown in figure [ lightcurves ] .",
    "these light curves were created by dividing each region s flux density at each epoch by the mean region flux density found from averaging all epochs . to aid in readability of our graph , the aligned component ( c2 ) , the northern lobe , and the southern lobe",
    "are displaced on the @xmath37-axis by 1 , 2 , and 3 units , respectively .    from figure [ lightcurves ] and table [ big_gaussian ] we find that component c1 substantially increases in flux over the 15 y baseline , starting from 18 mjy in 1990 and increasing in brightness to 59 mjy in 2005 .",
    "we also find that component c2 is variable , ranging from less than 10 mjy in 1990 , to 24 mjy in 1996 , and 20 mjy in 2005 .",
    "because our 1990 epoch was observed with mk ii vlbi , this apparent variability could be in part attributed to poor data quality .",
    "however , the measured flux for all other components in 1990 is quite consistent with that in our later epochs , suggesting that the calculated upper limit for component c2 s flux in 1990 is reliable and that the observed variability in this component is significant . for the southern and northern components",
    ", we find that there is no substantial variation in the fluxes over the 15 y baseline .",
    "based on the time variability observed in both c1 and c2 we can estimate the size of these components .",
    "however , in this case the variability time scale found for c1 and c2 is quite long ( roughly 5 to 10 y ) , which gives a weak upper limit on the sizes of the components of a few parsecs , consistent with the estimate made in  [ radiocont ] .    to calculate the relative velocity of the components , we chose component c1 as the reference , based on its strength , compactness , and isolation relative to other components in the source .",
    "we compared the relative motion for each epoch by fitting a line to each component s relative position , split into @xmath38 and @xmath37 components , as a function of time .",
    "results of this fitting process are listed in table [ motions_table ] , and plotted in figure [ c2 ] .",
    "the results of this analysis reveal significant motion for the northern hot spots n1 and n2 , yielding a value of 0.054 @xmath11 0.008 mas / y , or ( 0.185 @xmath11 0.008)c , and 0.033 @xmath11 0.006 mas / y , or ( 0.114 @xmath11 0.019)c respectively .",
    "these results show that the northern jet is moving away from the two central components to the northeast .    for the southern components s2 and s3 ,",
    "significant motion was also found , yielding 0.0073 @xmath11 0.0025 mas / y , or ( 0.0251 @xmath11 0.0085)c , and 0.016 @xmath11 0.003",
    "mas / y , or ( 0.056 @xmath11 0.010)c respectively .",
    "for the other two southern components , s1 and s4 , even though the values found for the velocities were larger than those found for s2 and s3 , the values obtained in the fitting for @xmath39 were large , a fact that can be verified by looking at figures [ s1](d ) and [ s1](g ) .",
    "however , for the projected @xmath38 position of component s4 with time , the @xmath39 obtained was nearly unity , which gives us some confidence in the motion of this component , at least in the @xmath38 direction .",
    "we conclude then that , on average , the southern jet is moving away from the two central components to the southwest , though more slowly than the northern jet .",
    "the results obtained for c2 show no significant motion .",
    "the value obtained for the limit on the motion of this component is equal to 0.0067 @xmath11 0.0094 mas / y , or less than 0.088c .    in figure [ vlba05model ]",
    "we draw arrows showing the direction of motion found for each component , as well as their relative magnitude .",
    "it is important to note that we placed arrows even for those components for which we do not claim significant motion .",
    "by appropriately tapering our 22 ghz 2005 data , we obtained an image resolution matched to our 8 ghz continuum image .",
    "these two images were then combined to generate an image of the spectral index distribution across the source ( figure [ vlba05spix8 - 22 ] ) . in both hotspots of the source , n2 and s2 ,",
    "a steep spectrum was found , whereas in both central components , the spectrum is flat . a plot of flux density as a function of frequency is included in the image of the spectral index distribution for both c1 and c2 .",
    "the values for the flux densities used in order to make these plots were measured from matching resolution images .",
    "details regarding these results are listed in table [ peak_fluxes ] .",
    "four possible scenarios were proposed by @xcite in order to explain the unusual properties found in 0402 + 379 .",
    "two of them were ruled out , but the possibility that c1 or c2 was an unusual jet component in a dense ism could not be conclusively eliminated .",
    "our high resolution observations confirm the compactness of component c2 , and measure a size of 0.124 @xmath11 0.035 pc .",
    "c2 is found to have no significant motion , whereas significant flux density variability is found .",
    "the spectral peak is shown to be at @xmath40 ghz .",
    "it is possible that either or both c1 and/or c2 could be a jet component lit up in a collision with a dense interstellar medium . in this scenario",
    "the low observed velocity ( @xmath41c ) is due to the impact with the ism , and the spectrum is modified by local acceleration of particles .",
    "difficulties with the jet component explanation are ( 1 ) it requires a dramatic change in the jet axis on timescales of a few 10s of years , while the larger scale emission ( see figure [ vlba05maps1 ] ) indicates that the jet axis has been fairly stable on time scales up to 10@xmath42 y ; ( 2 ) a large gradient in density needs to be invoked to decelerate c1 and/or c2 but allow the hotspots to advance @xcite ; ( 3 ) if c2 is the core responsible for the observed jets and hot spots , and c1 is a jet component , then the counterjet is conspicuous in its absence given the orientation of the source close to the plane of the sky indicated by the source symmetry .",
    "the absence of a jet associated with c1 might at first seem unusual since only 6 of 87 ( 7% ) sources in the first caltech - jodrell bank vlbi survey ( cj1 - the survey in which 0402 + 379 was imaged by xu et al .",
    "1995 ) show naked cores with no sign of a jet at 5 ghz . at lower flux levels , however , which are more appropriate since c1 by itself would not have made it into the cj1 sample , the fraction of naked cores increases to 6 of 24 sources ( 25% - taylor et al .",
    "thus the absence of a jet from c1 is not by itself evidence against the identification of c1 as an agn .",
    "the characteristics found in c1 and c2 are typical of agn ; in a complete survey of 32 sources imaged at 43 ghz , @xcite found no unresolved , isolated jet components .",
    "this , together with the morphology of 0402 + 379 , leads us to surmise that neither c1 nor c2 is likely to be a jet component .",
    "this leaves the remaining most likely explanation that c1 and c2 are both active black holes in a compact system . for the remainder of the discussion",
    "we assume that this is the case and explore what we can learn about such a system from the present observations .",
    "we can use the het and the vlba observations to obtain kinematic constraints on the mass of the black hole system . at our observed separation , an orbital velocity of",
    "300km / s implies a system mass of @xmath43(@xmath44 km s@xmath6)@xmath45 ( @xmath46 pc ) m@xmath47 the suggested line splitting from the optical spectra thus implies a mass of a few times @xmath48 . if both radio nuclei are also optically active and show comparable emission line strengths , as expected , then the observed gaussian line widths put a limit on the line fwhm of @xmath49 km s@xmath6 , implying a limit on the combined black hole mass of @xmath50 .",
    "note that the hi absorption profiles of @xcite also found velocity structure of @xmath51 km s@xmath6 extending over a transverse distance of @xmath52 pc . on this scale",
    "the mass contribution from gas and stars is not significant , so the limit obtained reflects the mass of the binary black hole system and indicates a high mass system .",
    "the implied mass , @xmath53 , could be dominated by the agn , if the absorption occurs in the nuclear region .",
    "alternatively the two velocity systems might be probing line - of - sight velocities in the products of a recent merger .",
    "an alternative estimate for the central compact object mass can be derived from the blue luminosity of the host bulge @xcite .",
    "the observed v magnitude of 0402 + 379 is @xmath54 @xcite , after correcting for the galactic @xmath55 and a median b - v color index of @xmath56 for 484 ellipticals in the uppsala general catalogue ( ugc ) , we obtain a b magnitude of 17.8 .",
    "this corresponds to a central compact object mass of @xmath57 , in reasonable accord with the estimates above , given that this may still be a disturbed system .      using our system mass estimate equal to 1.5 @xmath58 m@xmath59 and the projected radial separation between them derived from our 2005 maps ( 7.3 pc ) , we find from kepler s laws that the period of rotation for such a binary supermassive black hole system should be @xmath60 y. this period corresponds to a relative projected velocity between components c1 and c2 of @xmath61 c. the upper limit found for component c1 , @xmath41c , is consistent with the expected relative velocity between c1 and c2 , assuming a stable , keplerian orbit . to actually constrain the masses of the black holes",
    "would require observations over a longer time baseline ( @xmath62 y ) .",
    "what sort of gravitational wave signal might a binary supermassive black hole in 0402 + 379 generate ? assuming the current separation is 7.3",
    "pc and the total mass is @xmath63  the natural gravitational wave frequency @xcite is approximately @xmath64 hz .",
    "this is well below the expected minimum frequency of lisa .",
    "although 0402 + 379 may be a long way from generating a detectable gravitational wave signal it may represent a source of noise important for future observations of cosmologically produced gravitational radiation .",
    "ultra low frequency gravitational radiation generated during inflation @xcite has an upper limit of 10@xmath65 hz .",
    "thus , a population of black hole binaries like 0402 + 379 may generate substantial noise which could interfere with the detection of the physics of inflation .",
    "an estimate of this noise contribution requires a population synthesis model ( e.g. , sesana et al . 2005 ) which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the final stage in the evolution of a binary black hole system is the gravitational radiation stage , where the semimajor axis decreases to the point at which gravitational radiation becomes the dominant dissipative force .",
    "a binary black hole on a circular orbit will merge within the time @xcite :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the masses of the black holes , and @xmath69 is the separation between them , once the system is in the final stage . using the projected radial separation between the black holes we measure for 0402 + 379 ( 7.3 pc ) and assuming they both have a mass equal to @xmath70",
    ", we obtain a merger time equal to @xmath71 y. some other loss of angular momentum will be necessary if this system is to merge in less than a hubble time .",
    "it is not clear whether , at present , dynamical friction losses or gas dissipative effects ( see komossa 2003a , merritt & milosavljevi 2005 ) are strong enough to bring the binary to the gravitational radiation loss regime within a hubble time .",
    "this relates to the issue of the probability of catching the binary at its present ( modest ) separation .",
    "are we seeing a recent merger in the act of core coalescence or has the binary stalled and must now await loss - cone replenishment and/or re - supply of nuclear gas ?",
    "the fact that both nuclei are active ( radio bright ) suggests on - going accretion and implies dissipation today . only a larger sample of imaged active nuclei can address the fraction of the population in this state , for example the vlba imaging and polarization survey ( vips , taylor et al . 2005 ) which will image 1169 sources .      assuming that c2 is the origin of the radio emission on parsec scales",
    ", we can constrain the orientation of 0402 + 379 . in the simple beaming model for simultaneously ejected jet components moving in opposite directions , both the arm length ratio @xmath72 and the flux density ratio @xmath73 depend on the intrinsic speed @xmath74 and the angle of the twin jets to the line of sight @xmath75 . the arm length ratio ,",
    "@xmath76 , is given by    @xmath77    where the apparent projected distances from c2 ( assumed to be the origin of radio emission ) are @xmath78 for the northern jet ( approaching side ) and @xmath79 for the southern jet ( receding side ) , and the apparent proper motions are @xmath80 for the northern jet and @xmath81 for the southern jet .",
    "similarly , the flux density ratio , @xmath82 , between the northern and southern jet is    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the spectral index , @xmath85 for a continuous jet , and @xmath86 for discrete jet components ( c.f .",
    "lind & blandford 1985 ) .    in order to determine the arm length ratio we calculated the distances from n2 and s2 to c2 ( using the values shown in table [ big_gaussian ] ) , yielding a value of @xmath87 .    for the proper motion ratio we proceeded as follows .",
    "we determined a flux density weighted average velocity , for both the northern and southern components , with respect to c2 , using the values shown in table [ motions_table ] ( calculating the @xmath38 and @xmath37 components separately and then calculating the resultant value ) . following this procedure",
    "we obtained a value of @xmath88 .",
    "the flux density ratio was obtained dividing the sum of the fluxes of the northern components by the sum of the fluxes of the southern components ( see table [ big_gaussian ] ) , yielding a value of @xmath89 .",
    "if doppler boosting dominates the appearance of 0402 + 379 then all the ratios calculated should be in agreement according to equations [ arm_ratio ] and [ flux_ratio ] .",
    "however , using @xmath90 and estimating a value for the spectral index of both the north and south hotspots of @xmath91 ( see table [ peak_fluxes ] ) , we find that @xmath92 , @xmath88 , and @xmath93 , results that are far from agreement , thus ruling out doppler boosting as the dominant effect . a possible explanation for this discrepancy could be an enhancement in the density of the interstellar medium to the south of the core , which will reduce the velocity in that direction ; slow the expansion over time , thus changing the arm length ratio ; and increase the flux density of the southern jet .",
    "additional supporting evidence for this hypothesis comes from the enhancement in hi opacity to the southwest @xcite . assuming that the density enhancement is a recent phenomenon",
    ", we can use the arm length ratio obtained in addition to equation [ arm_ratio ] to get @xmath94 .",
    "this result implies that the intrinsic velocity must be at least 0.4c and @xmath95 must be less than @xmath96 .    using the relative velocity between the northern and southern jets ( calculated from the values obtained for the flux density weighted averaged velocities of both the southern and northern components ) as well as the distance between components s2 and n2 , we estimated the age of the current radio emission to be @xmath97 y.",
    "if the slower jet velocities for the southern jet are used then the age for the southern lobe is three times as large .",
    "note that these jet ages are much less than the @xmath98 y binary period in  [ smbh ] , so we expect no significant orbital displacement of the jet components .",
    "based on the compactness , motion , variability , and spectra of the two central components in 0402 + 379 we conclude that they are both active nuclei of a single galaxy .",
    "this pair of agn forms the closest binary black hole system yet discovered with a projected separation of 7.3 pc .",
    "the total mass of the system is estimated to be @xmath99 m@xmath100 , and the gravitational radiation frequency to be 2@xmath101 hz .",
    "energy losses due to gravitational radiation are not yet significant , so that other mechanisms must be invoked if the orbit is to decay . 0402 + 379 may be the tip of an iceberg for a population of supermassive black hole binaries with parsec scale separations . such a population may produce significant gravitational wave radiation which may need to be considered for the detection of gravitational radiation in the ultra to very low frequency bands .",
    "having found one system in the cjf sample @xcite of 293 sources , we might expect to find others in a larger survey .",
    "the vips @xcite will image 1169 sources and hopefully find additional compact binary black holes .",
