    "`` how many wz sge - type dwarf novae are known ? ''  this recent question by an acquainted astronomer was the motivation of this paper .",
    "wz sge - type dwarf novae ( dne ) or wz sge - type objects are a class of su uma - type dwarf novae which is a kind of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) [ for general information of cvs , dne , su uma - type dwarf novae and superhumps , see e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae are defined by the presence of superhumps , which have periods longer than the orbital period by a few percent .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae are known to show short , normal outbursts and superoutbursts and superhumps are always present during superoutbursts .",
    "wz sge - type dwarf novae were originally proposed as a group of dwarf novae with unusually high ( @xmath18 mag ) amplitudes and rare outbursts ( approximately once a decade ) .",
    "the definition has been changing as our knowledge improved , and currently the definition is somewhat different from the original one .    in the 1990s",
    ", there were only a handful of wz sge - type dwarf novae and they were generally considered to be a rare population of dwarf novae or cataclysmic variables  it was common knowledge among astronomers working in that epoch . since 2004 , however , the situation has been dramatically changing thanks to the increased activity of sky surveys and amateur astronomers , and the number of wz sge - type dwarf novae discovered in a year reached nearly ten in 2014 .",
    "since much information has been collected since the last compilation of wz sge - type dwarf novae @xcite and collection of early superhumps in various objects @xcite , we are tempted to review the recent progress of this field .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on optical ( and sometimes near - infrared ) photometric observations and deal with the current understanding of the outburst phenomenon , superhumps and early superhumps , evolutionary status and related topics .",
    "we do not deal with other interesting topics related to wz sge - type objects , such as pulsation of the white dwarf ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and hard x - ray emission during outburst ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this paper also does not deal with detailed spectroscopic analysis ( including doppler tomograms ) , oscillations , ultraviolet and x - ray observations .    the paper is loosely arranged in the order of the definition ( and historical background ) , observations , theories and interpretation .",
    "however , the topics are often related each other , we put some theoretical background and short interpretations in the observation part , so that readers can know implications of observational features more easily .    in this paper",
    ", we use abbreviated names whose full names are listed in table [ tab : wzsgemember ] .",
    "the data referred to as @xcite@xcite include the public data from the aavso international databasehttp://www.aavso.org / data - download@xmath2 . ] .",
    "when the class `` wz sge - type dwarf novae '' was first proposed after the dramatic discovery of the second historical outburst of wz sge ( see e.g. @xcite ) , two cataclysmic variables uz boo and wx cet were reported to comprise a distinct sub - group of the dwarf novae together with wz sge @xcite .",
    "the properties of this subgroup were that they show ( b1 ) large outburst amplitudes ( approximately 8 mag ) , ( b2 ) slow declines from outbursts , and ( b3 ) long intervals between outbursts . among these properties , ( b1 ) and",
    "( b3 ) have been generally used to define this class .",
    "the property ( b2 ) probably referred to the long duration of the outbursts ( now confirmed to be superoutbursts ) rather than the decline rate itself .",
    "observation of wx cet in quiescence by @xcite supported the spectroscopic similarity of wx cet to wz sge proposed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite used in their famous atlas of southern and equatorial dwarf novae a classification of wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "this publication listed wx cet , al com , uz boo , v890 aql and wz sge as wz sge - type objects and rz leo , go com , v551 sgr , yy tel , ao oct and vy aqr as candidate wz sge - type objects .",
    "this list was selected by the low outburst frequency and large outburst amplitudes , and some objects were included simply due to the lack of observations or overestimation of the amplitudes ( among them , v890 aql turned out to be a chance mis - identification of an asteroid : @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also suggested v358 lyr to be a candidate wz sge - type dwarf nova .",
    "@xcite provided a list of objects which were considered to be wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "this list consisted of vy aqr , uz boo , wx cet , al com , do dra , v592 her , rz leo , wz sge and bz uma and was apparently selected by the long ( more than 4  yr ) recurrence time .",
    "@xcite listed bc uma as an object having properties similar to wz sge .",
    "@xcite provided a slightly modified set of properties : ( d1 ) the duration of the outbursts is greater ( weeks , versus days in ordinary dwarf novae ) , ( d2 ) the time between outbursts is greater ( years versus months ) , and ( d3 ) the size of the outbursts is greater ( 68 mag vs 25 mag ) .",
    "@xcite also listed a possible property ( d4 ) the strengths of their emission lines in quiescence are greater than those of typical dwarf novae .",
    "@xcite studied wx cet in detail . after a comparison of objects suggested to be similar to wz sge",
    ", @xcite concluded that there is no reason to retain the distinction between wz sge and su uma subclasses of dwarf novae .",
    "the conclusion was mainly drawn from the presence of normal ( short ) outbursts and superhumps in what were supposed to be wz sge - type objects  these properties were then considered as properties common to su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "@xcite , however , summarized the objects listed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and provided a convenient list of `` properties of possible , probable and certain wz sge stars '' , which has , rather ironically , become the prototypical collection of wz sge - type candidates .",
    "it would be noteworthy that these `` classical '' definitions did not include the lack ( or rarity ) of short outbursts , which has long been discussed particularly in wz sge .      in the late 1980s ,",
    "observations of faint cvs with ccds became more popular ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "howell s group systematically observed previously neglected faint cvs in high galactic latitudes and found many short - period systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "during the course of these surveys , @xcite noticed that ( for systems below the period gap ) the mean outburst amplitude for the halo dwarf novae is 3 mag greater than for the disk dwarf novae .",
    "they finally reached a concept of `` tremendous outburst amplitude dwarf novae '' or toads @xcite .",
    "the term toads was sometime used as a synonym of wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "both the historical definitions ( subsection [ sec : historical ] ) and toads , however , suffered from strong contamination of ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae , since they were primarily based on the amplitude of outbursts ( especially in toads , the amplitude was the sole criterion ) and the second proposed prototype , wx cet , was , after all , shown to be a rather normal su uma - type dwarf nova ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) whose historical outbursts were missed likely due to poor observational conditions .",
    "there were many similar cases , such as vy aqr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such a contamination of ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae to the proposed subclass unavoidably blurred the border , if any , between su uma - type and wz sge - type subclasses and complicated the discussion .",
    "it was a natual consequence that the distinction between wz sge and su uma subclasses could not be confirmed @xcite .",
    "@xcite even stated that the extreme behavior of the wz sge stars is not a result of the approach of the secondary towards the limit of its evolution as a non - degenerate star at an orbital period ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath180 min , perfectly contrary to the current understanding .",
    "this conclusion was probably a result of inclusion of do dra , which is an outbursting intermediate polar with long cycle lengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; the contamination by various classes of objects apparently seriously damaged the discussion around that time .    the case for toads was even more serious , since they were classified only by the amplitude of outbursts , and @xcite severely criticized the distinction of dwarf novae by outburst amplitudes by showing the continuous distribution of outburst amplitudes .",
    "in the meantime , several objects which had been proposed to be similar to wz sge - type dwarf novae underwent a dramatic outburst .",
    "this epoch coincided with the second - stage progress of ccd photometry in cv research : using small telescope(s ) and ccd to detect short - term variations during outburst , which was first systematically conducted by the author ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the first case was in hv vir in 1992 april @xcite . during the early stage of the outburst ,",
    "double - wave periodic modulations were detected .",
    "although these modulations were detected independently by different groups ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and our group ) , the distinction of these modulations from ( ordinary ) superhumps should await yet another object .",
    "our result of hv vir in 1992 was published in @xcite following modern interpretation .",
    "the second case was in al com in 1995 [ although there were outbursts of ll and in 1993 december ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and uz boo in 1994 august ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the observational condition for these objects was not favorable enough to securely characterize the nature of these objects ] .",
    "the 1995 outburst of al com was well - observed and the existence of double - wave modulations during the early stage of the outburst was established ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that their period is almost same as the orbital period .",
    "these double - wave modulations having period equal to the orbital period were also recorded in the 19781979 outburst of wz sge @xcite , and they were started to be recognized as properties unique to wz sge - type dwarf novae ( cf .",
    "these modulations were called early superhumps @xcite , outburst orbital humps @xcite or superorbital modulations @xcite .",
    "since the term `` superorbital period '' is now widely used in different meaning in x - ray binaries ( e.g. @xcite ) , the last name is rather confusing and is not used for these double - wave modulations during outburst .",
    "@xcite proposed to use `` early humps '' .",
    "now the term `` early superhumps '' appears to be used most frequently and we use this term in this paper .",
    "the common existence of early superhumps almost exclusively in dwarf novae with infrequent large - amplitude , long - lasting outbursts became clearer as new observations became available .",
    "although early observations are still somewhat less clear ( eg cnc in 1996 november - december : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , rz leo in 2000 december @xcite ) , two dramatic outbursts of wz sge in 2001 july and al com in 2001 may ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) led to secure and impressive detection of these modulations .",
    "after these detections , early superhumps have been regularly detected in dwarf novae with similar systems and the existence of early superhumps gradually became the defining characteristics of wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "this classification received support from theoretical consideration .",
    "@xcite identified early superhumps as manifestation of the 2:1 resonance [ note that @xcite was the first to point out that double peaked light curve in wz sge can be related to the 2:1 resonance ] .",
    "this resonance is almost impossible to achieve for ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae , and only objects with extreme mass - ratios are expected to show early superhumps .",
    "the modern definition of wz sge - type dwarf novae showing early superhumps as manifestation of the 2:1 resonance is favorable in several respects : ( 1 ) it is based on the physical mechanism involved in variation , ( 2 ) the double - wave profile of early superhumps is very characteristic and they can be identified even if the orbital period is not known , and ( 3 ) the objects showing these early superhumps comfortably fit the classical definition of wz sge - type dwarf novae . as discussed later , the appearance of early superhumps is inclination - dependent and it is problematic that not all objects achieving the 2:1 resonance show early superhumps .",
    "although it is widely accepted that objects showing early superhumps ( persisting at least several days ) are classified as wz sge - type dwarf novae , the classification is somewhat ambiguous for objects without detectable early superhumps .      since the early period on , the complexity of outburst light curves of wz sge - type dwarf novae ( and candidates ) received attention . a short ( @xmath11  d ) dip was noticed in al com as early as @xcite .",
    "@xcite also noticed a similar dip in wz sge during the 19781979 outburst of wz sge .",
    "@xcite stated that dips in the declining branches of the outbursts might be a distinctive feature of wz sge - type stars ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite also remarked on this phenomenon .",
    "a collection of light curves showing a variety of complexity can be seen in @xcite .",
    "although the dip phenomenon was recorded in wz sge and al com , the phenomenon now referred to as rebrightenings ( or echo outbursts ) received attention since the detection of two rebrightenings in an x - ray transient v518 per = gro j0422@xmath432 .",
    "@xcite suggested that x - ray transients and wz sge - type dwarf novae ( referred to as toads in their paper ) have common characteristics by presenting the two post - outburst rebrightenings in uz boo which underwent an outburst in 1994 .",
    "although this conclusion was based on visual observations and the existence of multiple rebrightenings in uz boo was somewhat doubtful , the existence of four rebrightenings was confirmed during the 20032004 and 2013 outbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the epoch - making phenomenon was the outburst of eg cnc in 1996 november - december .",
    "six rebrightenings were detected by a large collaboration mainly conducted by the vsnet team @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon was announced in real - time on the internet and a theoretical paper @xcite was issued with a reference to our preprint .    since then , a long rebrightening similar to those in wz sge and al com was recorded in cg cma @xcite .",
    "recent observations have indicated wz sge - type dwarf novae are frequently associated with multiple rebrightenings ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and this phenomenon has been considered to be potential defining characteristics of wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "some authors classify objects with multiple rebrightenings as wz sge - type dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism of multiple rebrightenings , however , is not as well understood as early superhumps , and it is not known whether ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae never show multiple rebrightenings .      in recent years , objects with large - amplitude outbursts ( typically @xmath18 mag , at least greater than 6 mag ) that exhibit early superhumps at least for several days during the early stage of long outbursts have been unambiguously classified as wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "as theory predicts @xcite , some low - inclination systems do not show detectable early superhumps .",
    "in such cases , the existence of a long - duration segment ( approximately 10  d or more ) without short - term photometric variations before starting to exhibit ordinary superhumps has been usually considered as a signature of `` unobservable '' early superhumps .",
    "objects showing large - amplitude outbursts with this signature have been usually identified as wz sge - type dwarf novae although there is currently no way to confirm that the 2:1 resonance is indeed working .",
    "the presence of multiple rebrightenings is considered to be supportive evidence .",
    "these criteria general match the historical category .",
    "the shortest measured intervals of long outbursts in objects satisfying these criteria is slightly over 4  yr ( ez lyn ; @xcite ; @xcite and ot j213806 ; @xcite ) , and one exceptional case of @xmath1450  d al com in 2013 and 2015 , the latter lacked the stage of early superhump but showed a long rebrightening .",
    "the problem of this criteria will be discussed later .",
    "figure [ fig : discyear ] indicates the discovery statistics of wz sge - type objects .",
    "the year when the wz sge - type nature ( in the modern sense ) was recognized is used to draw this figure .",
    "up to 2000 , wz sge - type object were rare objects and they were sometimes called by `` the @xmath5-th wz sge - type object '' . there has been a dramatic increase of the number since 2004 , when asas-3 @xcite started discovering new wz sge - type objects . in recent years , the tendency is more striking after the increase of discovery by crts @xcite , master @xcite and asas - sn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the most recent year of 2014 ,",
    "the contribution of the surveys are : crts ( 1 ) , master ( 1 ) , asas - sn ( 9 ) and amateur discoveries ( 6 ) .",
    "although asas - sn has been discovering a great number of wz sge - type objects , wide - field survey of bright transients by amateur astronomers still has a great impact in this field .",

    "this figure can be compared to figure 13 ( distribution of outburst amplitude of all dwarf novae ) in @xcite , who criticized the concept of toads by indicating that the distribution of amplitudes makes a smooth continuum .",
    "although we no longer use the amplitude as the primary criterion of wz sge - type dwarf novae , it is evident that wz sge - type dwarf novae occupy the region with largest outburst amplitudes .",

    "is recorded in sss j224739 . since the measurement of outburst amplitudes is severely limited for large - amplitude systems and fainter objects ,",
    "the present statistics is severely biased for objects with smaller amplitudes .",
    "measurements of more reliable quiescent magnitudes to determine the amplitudes are desired for many less - studied objects , although wz sge - type dwarf novae usually stay 1 mag or more brighter than the pre - outburst ( for example , v455 and has not returned to the pre - outburst level even six years after the 2007 outburst according to the crts data ) , these measurements would require additional years .    the objects with smallest values are v1108 her , ez lyn , eg cnc , pt and , sdss j161027 and ss lmi .",
    "the quiescent magnitude of v1108 her is difficult to measure due to the close companion .",
    "the magnitudes are approximate for pt and and ss lmi , and may be underestimated ( or these objects may be borderline objects ) .",
    "ez lyn is an eclipsing system and the outburst amplitude is expected to be smaller than if the object were seen from pole - on .",
    "considering these examples , many of wz sge - type objects with low outburst amplitudes in this survey may not reflect the true strength of the outburst .",
    "this would strengthen that the majority of wz sge - type objects have amplitudes larger than 7 mag .",

    "of course , not all outbursts were detected in the objects with multiple known outbursts and these values contain intervals longer than the actual ones . instead , many objects have only one outburst detections and it is impossible to determine the intervals .",

    "besides the claim of the enhanced orbital signal during rebrightenings in wz sge @xcite ( see subsection [ sec : outhist ] for the discussion ) , there was possible transient appearance of the orbital signal in the low - inclination system gw lib near the end of the superoutburst plateau @xcite .",

    "when the secondary star in the system becomes degenerate , the system reaches the `` period minimum '' and the orbital period then increases .",
    "this is due to two reasons : the thermal time - scale of the secondary exceeds the mass - transfer time - scale and the mass - radius relation is reversed for degenerate dwarfs .",
    "the systems evolved beyond the period minimum are usually called `` period bouncers '' .",

    "wz sge itself was also claimed to have a small @xmath43 @xcite by the same method .",

    "we briefly review the outline of the method here .",
    "the precession rate of the disk , @xmath45 , is equivalent to the fractional superhump excess ( in frequency ) @xmath46 and it is related to the conventional fractional superhump excess ( in period ) @xmath47 by a relation @xmath48 .",
    "the dynamical precession rate @xmath49 is @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the angular orbital frequency and the dimensionless radius measured in units of the binary separation @xmath40 .",

    "@xcite ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the laplace coefficient @xmath56 considering that the superhump wave is confined to the 3:1 resonance region during stage a ( hence the pressure effect can be neglected and the precession frequency reflects the pure dynamical one ) , we can substitute @xmath52 by the radius of the 3:1 resonance . @xmath57",
    "then @xmath58 becomes a function of @xmath37 and we can directly estimate @xmath37 from @xmath59 of stage a superhumps .",
    "this method is particularly useful for wz sge - type objects , since they usually show early superhumps , which have periods almost identical with the orbital periods , and stage a superhumps develop immediately following the stage of early superhumps . after a typical waiting time of @xmath110  d ( subsection [ sec : shdelay ] ) , we can relatively easily detect stage a superhumps and determine mass ratios . in papers",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , a sizable number of wz sge - type objects have been determined for @xmath37 using this method .",
    "the most up - to - date evolutionary diagram is shown in @xcite .",
    "@xcite also demonstrated that traditional methods ( such as @xcite ; @xcite ) for determining @xmath37 using ( stage b ) superhumps during the superoutburst plateau give systematically small @xmath37 values for small-@xmath37 systems because the pressure effect decreases the precession rate of this eccentric disk , and this relative importance of the effect is larger for systems with smaller precession rates ( i.e. wz sge - type objects ) .",
    "this explains why @xcite listed so many candidates for period bouncers using the fractional superhump excess .",
    "see @xcite for more detailed discussion .",
    "this new method has clarified mass ratios of many wz sge - type objects and clarified the evolutionary path to an unprecedented detail .",
    "according to the estimates in @xcite , many wz sge - type dwarf novae ( wz sge itself , too ) have mass ratios near the borderline between lower main - sequence and brown dwarf secondaries . the most recent work @xcite indicates a high concentration of wz sge - type object around orbital periods of 0.0540.056  d and mass ratios 0.060.08 .",
    "the spread of mass ratios in this region and the absence of objects in shorter periods suggests that these objects are indeed near the period minimum , and wz sge - type objects are indeed located near the period minimum .",
    "now it is no wonder some objects ( such as wz sge , @xcite ) have some evidence of infrared emission from the secondary while other objects have either undetectable secondaries or brown dwarf secondaries have been identified by eclipse studies in wz sge - type candidates ( subsection [ sec : evolution ] ) .",

    "this value may be considered as an empirical limit of mass ratios which enable the 2:1 resonance in outburst .",
    "some objects have apparently higher ( above 0.10 ) mass ratios but still show early superhumps .",

    "this relation strengthens our impression ( in our series papers up to @xcite ) that wz sge - type objects having properties similar to those of su uma - type dwarf novae have larger @xmath36 and extreme wz sge - type objects have smaller @xmath36 .",
    "we have derived @xmath65 we should note , however , this relation does not necessarily holds in longer period systems ( ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae ) as suggested by the presence of a number of long - period su uma - type objects with unusual values of @xmath36 ( e.g. @xcite ) .    assuming this linear relation holds in all wz sge - type objects , figure [ fig : wzpdottype7 ] can be directly read as a diagram between @xmath3 , @xmath37 and the outburst type .",

    "@xcite was the first to demonstrate the presence of the `` period spike '' around the period minimum .",

    "although eclipse observations have revealed a number of objects which contain secondaries whose masses are comparable to brown dwarfs ( see subsection [ sec : evolution ] for such objects ) , the majority of the theoretically expected period bouncers remained almost a missing population .",
    "although @xcite listed candidates based on several criteria , most of the listed objects did not meet sufficiently many criteria .",
    "@xcite listed estimates of @xmath37 values for some objects using the traditional method for converting fractional superhump excesses to @xmath37 .",
    "as already introduced in subsection [ sec : stageamethod ] , this traditional method gives systematically small @xmath37 values for low-@xmath37 objects like wz sge - type objects @xcite , and some of the listed objects in @xcite may not be good candidates for period bouncers .",

    "these objects , together with sss j122221 and ot j184228 , share common properties : ( 1 ) extremely long - lasting phase ( 100200 cycles ) of stage a ( subsection [ sec : stageadur ] ) and ( 2 ) very slow fading rates ( less than 0.05 mag d@xmath70 ) ( subsection [ sec : slowfading ] ) and ( 3 ) long superhump periods ( longer than 0.065  d ) .",
    "we consider they are currently known best criteria of period bouncers if they undergo superoutbursts .",
    "@xcite also made a statistical consideration assuming that mass - transfer rates ( from the secondary ) for these systems are 10100 times lower than ordinary su uma - type objects with similar superhump periods , based on the standard evolutionary model assuming the gravitational wave radiation as the main source of angular momentum loss , reached a conclusion that the recently discovered fraction of these candidate period bouncers among su uma - type dwarf novae can account for the theoretically expected population of period bouncers .",
    "characterization of these objects by detailed observations is now desired to unveil the nature of period bouncers . a further search for objects (",
    "some objects are already proposed in this paper , see section [ sec : wzsgelist ] ) using the above criteria will surely enrich our knowledge in period bouncers and cv evolution .",

    "if the secondary is a normal lower main - sequence star , the @xmath37 values for such systems should fall far outside the upper limit ( @xmath37=0.09 according to subsection [ sec : qdist ] ) of the 2:1 resonance .",
    "there are two possibilities in such systems : ( 1 ) either the white dwarf and or the secondary is anomalous and the true @xmath37 is smaller , or ( 2 ) higher-@xmath37 systems enable the 2:1 resonance in certain conditions .",
    "we consider ( 2 ) as an interesting possibility , since these objects have longer recurrence times compared to ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the outburst amplitude is also large ( 8.0 mag in v1251 cyg ) .",
    "we consider that in such systems the mass is more accumulated than in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae and the disk can reach the 2:1 resonance when the outburst is violent enough .",
    "@xcite showed that the absolute magnitudes of outbursting dwarf novae are almost constant following a weak linear function of the orbital period .",
    "@xcite refined the relation using greatly improved statistics and showed that the absolute magnitudes of outbursting dwarf novae are a good `` standard candle '' .",
    "the relation has a theoretical foundation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) assuming that the disk - instability model is responsible for dwarf nova outbursts ( section [ sec : outmech ] ) .",
    "as we will see in subsection [ sec : mainout ] , wz sge - type superoutbursts are different from ordinary su uma - type superoutbursts in that there is a phase of viscous decay before ordinary superhumps appear . during this phase ,",
    "the disk mass is much larger than ordinary su uma - type superoutbursts and the maximum brightness is not expected to be a standard candle .",
    "we instead used the magnitude when ordinary superhumps appears . as we will see in subsection [ sec : mainout ] , the disk is expected to have a size close to the radius of 3:1 resonance and the condition is analogous to ordinary su uma - type superoutbursts . in table",
    "[ tab : quimag ] , we collected magnitudes of wz sge - type objects when ordinary superhumps appear [ the data source is observations in @xcite@xcite ] .",
    "the measurement of these magnitudes is usually very easy and has a typical error of @xmath710.1 mag .",
    "only the objects with certain quiescent magnitudes ( such as sdss magnitudes ) are selected in the table .",
    "the order of the table is the same as in table [ tab : wzsgemember ] .",
    "we have added candidate period bouncers at the bottom for comparison purposes even though some of these objects do not have certain quiescent magnitudes .    since there is no estimate for the absolute magnitude",
    "when ordinary superhumps appear in the literature , we describe them as differences from quiescent magnitudes . in figure",
    "[ fig : quimag ] , we show the result together with su uma - type objects other than wz sge - type objects ( we call ordinary su uma - type objects in this subsection ) .",
    "since this figure is only for a comparison purpose , we omit the table and source information for each su uma - type object to avoid too much complexity and simply list the objects as the form of a footnote . in this diagram , ordinary su uma - type objects are widespread , while wz sge - type objects have surprisingly similar outburst `` amplitudes '' when superhumps start to appear .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of these values ( excluding candidate period bouncers ) are 6.4 and 0.7 mag , respectively .",
    "the values for the su uma - type objects are 4.3 and 1.1 mag , respectively . considering the variability in quiescence and the effect of inclination ( we neglected the both effects ) , it would not be an exaggeration to say that all wz sge - type objects essentially have the same outburst `` amplitudes '' when superhumps start to appear .",
    "if the absolute magnitude at the appearance of ordinary superhumps is constant , this implies that the quiescent absolute magnitudes in wz sge - type objects are almost the same , which gives somewhat different impression from figure 4 in @xcite .",
    "another surprise is that these `` amplitudes '' are only marginally larger ( only by 0.8 mag ) in period bouncers ( mean 7.2 mag and standard deviation 0.6 mag ) compared to wz sge - type objects .",
    "if it is indeed the case , absolute magnitudes in quiescence may not be a useful tool for selecting period bouncers .",
    "we consider the zero point of this figure bu two methods .",
    "the first one is according to the well - known relation in @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the outburst is @xmath72 for @xmath3 of most wz sge - type objects , this relation gives @xmath73=5.3 [ the dependence on @xmath3 is so small that even if we assume a period of 2.0  hr , @xmath73=5.1 ] . for su uma - type dwarf novae",
    "are in agreement with our magnitudes when superhumps start to appear within 0.5 mag . ] according to our assumption , the condition when ordinary superhumps appear is the same both in ordinary su uma - type objects and wz sge - type objects .",
    "if it is indeed the case , we can adopt the zero point of @xmath74=5.3 for this figure .",
    "the second one is to use the wz sge - type objects with known parallaxes .",
    "the distance of 43.5(@xmath710.3 ) pc for wz sge ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , 104(@xmath430 , @xmath6120 ) pc for gw lib @xcite , and 74 pc for v455 and ( listed in @xcite ) , give zero points of 6.7 , 5.1(@xmath710.6 ) and 6.6 , respectively .",
    "since wz sge and v455 and are high - inclination systems , and gw lib is nearly a pole - on system @xcite , these values need to be corrected . by using the corrections in table 1 in @xcite ,",
    "these values become 5.5 , 6.0(@xmath710.6 ) and 5.9 , respectively . considering the uncertainties",
    ", the zero point of the figure will be in the range of @xmath74=5.3 and @xmath74=5.8 .",
    "this value is close to the absolute magnitude of the plateau phase of @xmath74=5.5(@xmath710.2 ) in @xcite .",

    ", @xcite discovered that early superhumps developed while the object was still brightening ( see also subsection [ sec : eshevol ] ) , which excluded the possibility that _ the outburst is initiated by a sudden mass - transfer burst_. after lucid explanation of early superhumps by the 2:1 resonance by @xcite , @xcite considered that the 2:1 resonance is the most promising explanation for early superhumps .",
    "@xcite , however , claimed the detection of enhanced orbital humps in the phase - averaged light curves in the later stage , and claimed that they are the best evidence for enhanced mass - transfer in wz sge - type outburst .",
    "@xcite discussed this issue and they concluded that the enhanced orbital humps are the aspect effect in a high - inclination system by modeling the orbital light curves based on dissipation pattern of the superhump light source . according to @xcite , what looked like the enhanced hot spot by eclipse observations by @xcite is actually the superhump light source .      both di(tti)-type model and di model modified by the mtb - type effect",
    "have been proposed to explain outbursts of wz sge - type objects .",
    "the most serious consequence for the di - type model is that it requires extremely low quiescent viscosity is needed ( @xmath75 : @xcite ; @xmath76 : @xcite ) to explain the extreme interval ( 33  yr ) of outbursts in wz sge by avoiding inside - out outburst caused by viscous diffusion during quiescence .",
    "there are two approaches to tackle with this problem : ( 1 ) the quiescent viscosity is indeed extremely low in wz sge - type objects , and ( 2 ) quiescent viscosity is similar to that of ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae , but outbursts are suppressed . the approach ( 1 )",
    "is by @xcite , while a representative approach ( 2 ) is by @xcite , who considered the truncation of the inner disk either by magnetic fields @xcite or by the coronal syphon flow @xcite and avoided thermal instability to occur .",
    "the outburst should necessarily by initiated by mtb - type enhanced mass - transfer in the latter model .",
    "@xcite proposed a model in that the inner disk is truncated by the magnetism of the white dwarf and the mass - transfer rate is just above the critical mass - transfer rate .",
    "this model did not require an enhanced mass - transfer to produce an outburst .",
    "although @xcite succeeded in reproducing the long recurrence time , such an approach with a standard @xmath77 have their own problem , that is , the resultant duration of the outburst should be shorter than reality [ i.e. the duration should be similar to ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae ; in the case of @xcite , the duration was only 6  d ] since the stored mass is roughly inversely proportional to @xmath77 [ @xcite ; @xcite , who referred to such a disk as a `` leaky bucket '' in comparison to a low-@xmath77 as a `` big bucket '' ] .",
    "@xcite also criticized the model by @xcite based on the short duration of the computed outburst and on the absence of short outbursts preceding superoutburst in actual observation .    in the meantime ,",
    "the origin of the quiescent viscosity became more apparent , and @xmath77 can become very small in cold accretion disks ( such as in the disks with very low mass - transfer rate as in wz sge - type objects ) since the magnetic fields decay due to finite conductivity in the cold disk @xcite .",
    "this interpretation was proposed by @xcite , who considered a model to reproduce repetitive rebrightenings in eg cnc .",
    "although there have recently been less arguments against the low-@xmath77 model after the development of our knowledge about the origin of viscosity in accretion disks , attempts with standard @xmath77 in line with the idea by @xcite have been sought [ e.g. `` magnetic propeller '' model in @xcite ] . for a detailed comparison of different models , see @xcite .    in the tti model ,",
    "the wz sge - type outburst is explained in the following way ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath77 is sufficiently low [ the model by @xcite considered no viscosity in quiescence , and @xcite considered the consequences of a finite viscosity ] , the transferred matter does not spread by diffusion and stored in the outer part of the disk .",
    "this condition avoids the matter to spread to the inner disk and cause an inside - out outburst , which is not supported by observation .",
    "the accumulation time is long enough , and the stored angular momentum is sufficient to expand the disk beyond the 3:1 resonance once outburst occurs and all outbursts become superoutbursts ( cf . @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the stored mass in the disk is large , the outburst starts with a long viscous decay ( subsection [ sec : outtype ] ) , and when the 3:1 resonance starts working , superhumps develop and the outburst follows the evolution of a superoutburst of ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the main difference in this model from ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae is the absence of normal outbursts and the presence of a long viscous decay at the start of the superoutburst . at the time of @xcite ,",
    "early superhumps were not known and the 2:1 resonance was not considered . later this viscous decay phase is found to be governed by the 2:1 resonance and this resonance suppresses the growth of the 3:1 resonance ( subsection [ sec : shdelay ] ) .",
    "the repeated rebrightenings of eg cnc ( 19961997 ) attracted many researchers .",
    "@xcite proposed a working model in which the rebrightenings could be reproduced if @xmath77 remained higher than in quiescence some time after the end of the main superoutburst . @xcite",
    "originally considered the possible source of this high @xmath77 as a result of remaining turbulence in the disk which remains eccentric for a long time after the end of the superoutburst .",
    "this model was refined by considering the magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) origin of viscosity and its decay after the superoutburst @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that systems with rebrightening(s ) and systems with positive @xmath36 are well correlated .",
    "as introduced in subsection [ sec : stagebpvar ] , @xcite considered that positive @xmath36 is a result of expansion of the disk beyond the 3:1 resonance , and suggested an interpretation that the matter beyond the 3:1 resonance produces rebrightenings .",
    "although such an expansion of the disk has not been confirmed by numerical simulations ( it is essentially difficult to introduce disk instability - type condition in 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation ) , this `` reservoir of cool matter '' beyond the 3:1 resonance has been favored by infrared excess ( subsection [ sec : outburstcolor ] ) and the presence of na d absorption during the rebrightening phase ( subsection [ sec : outburstspec ] ) .",
    "we consider the matter beyond the 3:1 resonance is still a viable hypothesis .",
    "@xcite also followed this interpretation as the source of mass supply to the disk .    in the original tti model @xcite , the termination of the superoutburst could not be physically derived but was treated as a free parameter to best",
    "reproduce the observation .",
    "it was naively ( with some observational support ) considered that when the disk no longer becomes sufficiently eccentric , the tidal instability became insufficient to sustain the superoutburst and the rapid decline starts .",
    "@xcite reconsidered this issue and proposed that in objects with small tidal torques ( i.e. small-@xmath37 systems with @xmath78 ) the state of the superoutburst can be quenched even in the presence of an eccentric disk .",
    "@xcite showed this decoupling of thermal and tidal instabilities can explain both rebrightenings in wz sge - type objects and short recurrence times of er uma - type objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "the low-@xmath37 condition is common between these objects and the only difference is that wz sge - type objects have very low mass - transfer rates while er uma - type objects show high ones .",
    "this idea of decoupling was an extension of the working model by @xcite to reproduce the extremely short ( 19  d ) supercycle of rz lmi , and the smaller tidal effect for the matter beyond the 3:1 resonance followed @xcite .",
    "the recently published paper by @xcite followed the same line as in @xcite and indicated that rebrightenings can be understood as `` repeated reflections of transition waves which mediate changes between the hot and the cool state of the accretion disk and travel back and forth in the outer disk region '' . in this interpretation ,",
    "the inner part of the disk remains permanently hot during the rebrightening phase .",
    "@xcite also explained `` mini - rebrightenings '' as a result of the intermediate state in the so - called s - shape of the thermal equilibrium curve .",
    "@xcite also supposed the necessity of continuous mass inflow from the outermost region , and they ascribed this source to the storage of matter beyond the 3:1 resonance , as originally suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also noted that observations indicate faster rise than decline in rebrightenings ( cf .",
    "subsection [ sec : rebprop ] ) , indicating that the heating wave should move faster than the cooling wave .",
    "as the term `` echo outbursts '' was originally introduced to describe phenomenon in x - ray binaries @xcite , which is somewhat different ( repeated upward deviations from the exponential declines in classical x - ray transients ) from the phenomenon in wz sge - type dwarf novae and these `` echoes '' in x - ray binaries were interpreted as the irradiation - induced mass - transfer , it was quite natural that there were mtb - type explanations for wz sge - type rebrightening .",
    "[ we should note that @xcite already indicated that the irradiation effect is expected to be much smaller in dwarf novae than in x - ray transients .",

    "@xcite tried to reproduce rebrightenings in eg cnc by an enhanced mass - transfer .",
    "@xcite partly succeeded in reproducing the light curve .",
    "@xcite supported this interpretation by the claimed detection of enhanced orbital humps during the rebrightening phase . as is evident from the result of numerical simulation by @xcite , this type of enhanced mass - transfer results a temporary shrinkage of the disk radius ( cf .",
    "recent observations of systems with multiple rebrightenings did not show such a shrinkage of the disk radius as determined from the superhump periods with the modern interpretation of precession rates , since the pressure effect can be neglected in cool , post - superoutburst disks ( ) .",
    "we consider that the enhanced mass - transfer model is not currently a viable one for explaining ( at least for ) repeated rebrightenings .",

    "the above models have no interpretation why some wz sge - type objects show rebrightening(s ) while others do not . as we have seen in this paper ( subsection [ sec : rebevol ] ) , higher-@xmath37 objects tend to show single rebrightenings .",

    "am cvn - type objects tend to more complex light curves of superoutbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "we provided the updated list of nearly 100 wz sge - type dwarf novae mainly based on the data obtained by the vsnet collaboration up to @xcite and discussed the statistics .",
    "the major findings we obtained can be summarized as follows .",
    "* wz sge - type dwarf novae are best defined as objects showing early superhumps .",
    "these variations are considered to be manifestation of the 2:1 resonance , and the resonance condition makes a distinction between wz sge - type dwarf novae and ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "in addition to this , the presence of long or multiple rebrightenings is also ( almost ) unique to this class of objects . *",
    "the median outburst amplitude is 7.7 mag and the majority of objects have amplitudes larger than 7.0 mag . *",
    "the orbital periods are mostly below 0.06  d , but there are objects with longer periods , some of which are considered to be period bouncers . * the median interval of observed superoutbursts is 11.5  yr , although this statistics is affected by various biases .",
    "the shortest known interval of superoutbursts is 450  d. * we reviewed the outburst type and showed representative examples of the light curves : type - a outbursts ( long - duration rebrightening ) , type - b outbursts ( multiple rebrightenings ) , type - c outbursts ( single rebrightening ) , type - d outbursts ( no rebrightening ) , and type - e outbursts ( double superoutbursts ) . *",
    "the outburst type is generally reproduced in each object on different superoutburst occasions , but there was an apparent exception in wz sge in 1946 .",
    "* we presented the updated atlas of early superhumps .",
    "* early superhumps are shown to grow during the rising phase of the superoutburst . *",
    "the amplitudes of early superhumps systematically decay as the outburst proceeds .",
    "the decay is slower in magnitude scale than flux scale . *",
    "the mean amplitudes of early superhumps are mostly less than 0.1 mag , and only a few systems show amplitudes larger than 0.2 mag .",
    "we can , however , detect early superhumps with amplitude larger than 0.02 mag in 63% of the studied wz sge - type dwarf novae , making early superhumps a useful distinguishing feature for wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "* we computed theoretical light curves assuming the model by @xcite .",
    "the result supports that the existence of many objects with low - amplitude early superhumps is consistent with low inclinations of these systems .",
    "the model predicts a larger number of high - amplitude systems than observation , which needs to be resolved . *",
    "as reported in earlier works , the outburst type has a strong correlation with period variation of superhumps and the orbital period . * the delay of appearance of ordinary superhumps",
    "is strongly correlated with the orbital period .",
    "we consider this is a result of the stronger 2:1 resonance in short - period systems .",
    "* using the recently developed method of measuring mass ratios using developing phase of superhumps ( stage a superhumps ) , we have been able to measure mass ratios of many wz sge - type objects . mass ratios of wz sge - type object have a peak around 0.070.08 .",
    "* we have identified a limit of mass ratio enabling the 2:1 resonance to be 0.09 .",
    "* by using these mass ratios , we showed that there is a linear relation between the period variation of superhumps and the mass ratio in wz sge - type objects . by using this relation",
    ", we were able to draw an evolutionary picture of a large number of wz sge - type .",
    "* we have identified the type of outburst to be an evolutionary sequence : type c @xmath0 d @xmath0 a @xmath0 b @xmath0 e , with some outliers for type - b objects . * the duration of stage a ( evolutionary phase ) of superhumps is also well correlated with the estimated mass ratios , supporting that this duration reflects the growth time of the 3:1 resonance . * by using these new tools ( mass ratios from stage a superhumps ) and duration of stage a , we have been able to identify candidates for period bouncers better than any existing criteria .",
    "combined with mass ratios from period variation of superhumps , some of the objects with multiple rebrightenings are considered to be period bouncers .",
    "* we have shown that the magnitude when ordinary superhumps appear can be used as a standard candle and have shown that many wz sge - type objects have relatively homogeneous quiescent absolute magnitudes .",
    "candidate period bouncers have slightly fainter ( by 0.8 mag ) quiescent absolute magnitudes .",
