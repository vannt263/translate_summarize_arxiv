    "<S> a longstanding conjecture by belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifshitz that the singularity in generic gravitational collapse is spacelike , local , and oscillatory is explored analytically and numerically in spatially inhomogeneous cosmological spacetimes . with a convenient choice of variables </S>",
    "<S> , it can be seen analytically how nonlinear terms in einstein s equations control the approach to the singularity and cause oscillatory behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic picture requires the drastic assumption that each spatial point evolves toward the singularity as an independent spatially homogeneous universe . in every case , </S>",
    "<S> detailed numerical simulations of the full einstein evolution equations support this assumption .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1tt@xmath0#1    _ introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ even though much of the theoretical effort in gravitational physics is focused on either quantum gravity or astrophysical sources of gravitational waves , the most fundamental properties of general solutions to einstein s equations remain unknown . </S>",
    "<S> foremost among these is the nature of the singularity that forms in generic gravitational collapse . </S>",
    "<S> powerful theorems due to penrose and hawking and others @xcite predict that some kind of singular behavior will result . </S>",
    "<S> however , the proofs of these theorems require very little of the details of the field equations and are thus unable to provide details of the nature of the singularity . </S>",
    "<S> many different types of singular behavior arise in a variety of special cases , but which , if any , of these characterize generic collapse is not known . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is hard to see that one could hope to answer the question . </S>",
    "<S> einstein s equations are second order nonlinear partial differential equations ( pde s ) in @xmath1 spacetime dimensions for the metric variables restricted by four constraints and with the freedom to impose four coordinate conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it is by no means clear that numerical relativity can help to answer this question either since a code will `` blow up '' if any variables become singular .    </S>",
    "<S> the surprising message of this essay then is that progress in understanding singularities in generic gravitational collapse can indeed be made . </S>",
    "<S> it requires a judicious choice of variables and a synergy between numerical simulations which suggest the patterns and analytic predictions which guide the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions are based on the properties of solutions with one or two directions of spatial symmetry . while these are not the most general solutions of einstein s equations , we believe they are sufficiently generic and sufficiently consistent with each other to indicate how completely general solutions are likely to behave .    </S>",
    "<S> approximately thirty years ago , belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifshitz ( bkl ) @xcite proposed , based on a perturbative analysis , that the singularity in generic collapse was spacelike , local , and oscillatory . in their picture , each spatial point evolves toward the singularity as a distinct mixmaster universe . </S>",
    "<S> their claim has been criticized but never unambiguously proven or refuted . </S>",
    "<S> in addition substantial effort is required to follow their arguments . </S>",
    "<S> our recent work , however , substantially supports their predictions and suggests a simple scenario : it appears that , despite their complexity , einstein s equations in the approach to the singularity have an attractor which is dominated by nonlinear terms acting as effective potentials for the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> these potential terms act primarily on one of the gravitational field degrees of freedom and lead to a generic asymptotic solution that supports the bkl description of the generic singularity as spacelike , local , and oscillatory . </S>",
    "<S> other information , such as spatial dependence and the behavior of the other degrees of freedom , is carried along by the dominant behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> our method of studying a given family of solutions as they approach the singualrity is essentially the following @xcite : we first determine the velocity - term dominated ( vtd ) solutions corresponding to the family . </S>",
    "<S> these are solutions of the ode s which result from the truncation of einstein s equations to eliminate all terms containing spatial derivatives ( plus certain others ; see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the vtd solutions are parametrized by spatially - dependent constants of integration ( the `` vtd parameters '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then substitute these solutions into the einstein equations or into the corresponding hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> if , for generic vtd parameters , the terms in the equations or the hamiltonian containing spatial derivatives become exponentially small ( hence , dynamically irrelevant ) as @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the time of the spacelike singularity ) , then we predict that the family is asymptotically velocity - term dominated ( avtd ) in the sense that a generic solution of the einstein equations asymptotically approaches a vtd solution . </S>",
    "<S> if not , we monitor which terms might become important ( as a result of exponential growth ) , and we try to predict the subsequent behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> we have applied this `` method of consistent potentials '' ( mcp ) to various families of cosmological solutions such as the gowdy spacetimes @xcite , the gowdy spacetimes with magnetic fields @xcite , and @xmath4 symmetric spacetimes @xcite . in all cases , using a choice of time based on geometric invariants connected with the symmetry , we get a clear prediction : either that the spacetime solutions in the family are avtd , or that they have oscillatory behavior characterized by a sequence of avtd - like epochs punctuated by `` bounces '' which involve the short - term awakening of certain of the `` potential '' terms </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , numerical simulations of solutions of the full einstein equations ( for each family ) have in all cases agreed ( at generic spatial points ) with the mcp predictions . </S>",
    "<S> while these numerical simulations can not be followed all the way to the singularity , they can be taken sufficiently far , with sufficient accuracy , to verify the simple bkl scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall now discuss some of the details of these studies , starting with a look at spatially homogeneous cosmologies .    </S>",
    "<S> _ homogeneous cosmologies . </S>",
    "<S> _ for a spatially homogeneous cosmology with flat spacelike hypersurfaces ( bianchi i ) , the hamiltonian for einstein s theory takes the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are respectively canonically conjugate to @xmath8 , the logarithm of the isotropic scale factor , and @xmath9 , the ( logarithmic ) anisotropic shears , and we have the kasner solutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are parametrized by the constants @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotically ( @xmath11 ) , the shear satisfies @xmath12 with @xmath13 satisfying as a consequence of the constraint ( [ kasnerh ] ) @xmath14    for more general homogeneous cosmologies , the hamiltonian @xmath15 adds a term @xmath16 which in certain cases @xcite takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are positive constants . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions corresponding to @xmath15 with this form of the potential are the well - studied mixmaster solutions @xcite . to see the oscillatory behavior of mixmaster solutions from the mcp point of view </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the bianchi i hamiltonian ( [ kasnerh ] ) is exactly the vtd version of the mixmaster hamiltonian , and the vtd solutions are the kasner spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> if we now substitute these kasner solutions into ( [ mixmasterv ] ) , as @xmath20 we have @xmath21 a few moments of reflection will show that the restriction ( [ kasnerrestrict ] ) implies that any generic values of @xmath22 will cause one of the @xmath23 to grow and the others to decay . </S>",
    "<S> the growing term provides an exponential potential for the dynamics . a bounce off the potential changes the sign of the appropriate combination of momenta . </S>",
    "<S> what happens then is that a pattern of growing and decaying terms continues indefinitely . </S>",
    "<S> it has long been known that this picture is borne out by the full solutions to einstein s equations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an example showing the evolution of the @xmath24 s and @xmath25 vs @xmath26 is given in fig .  1 .    _ inhomogeneous cosmologies . _ </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the gowdy family of spacetimes on @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> these allow spatial dependence in one direction with periodic boundary conditions and are described in terms of @xcite @xmath28 , @xmath29 , essentially the @xmath30 and @xmath31 polarizations of gravitational waves , and a background @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this model has the nice feature that the dynamical equations for the wave amplitudes @xmath33 , @xmath34 decouple from the constraints which yield @xmath35 as a function of the wave amplitudes .    </S>",
    "<S> einstein s evolution equations are obtained from the hamiltonian density @xcite @xmath36 where the @xmath37 s are the conjugate momenta and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> is set equal to @xmath39 . ] </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian constraint is the equation for @xmath40 ( where the overdot means @xmath41 ) while the momentum constraint is one for @xmath42 . neglecting spatial derivatives in the evolution equations yields , in the limit @xmath2 , the vtd solution @xmath43 with all the momenta dependent only on @xmath44 and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> substitution in ( [ gowdyh ] ) shows that the only terms in @xmath46 which could fail to be exponentially small are @xmath47 @xmath48 will grow exponentially if @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 will grow if @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> bounces off @xmath48 and @xmath50 eventually drive @xmath52 into the range @xmath53 , yielding a consistent avtd solution at almost every spatial point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  2 shows how this process works for @xmath48 and @xmath50 and @xmath33 vs @xmath54 at a typical spatial point .    </S>",
    "<S> the `` magnetic gowdy '' model is obtained by a change of topology and the addition of a magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vtd solution ( [ gowdyavtd ] ) is unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( [ gowdyh ] ) picks up an additional term @xmath55 where the constant @xmath56 measures the strength of the magnetic field and @xmath35 is now dynamical . </S>",
    "<S> substitution of the vtd solution ( [ gowdyavtd ] ) into ( [ gowdyv3 ] ) yields as @xmath2 @xmath57 the range @xmath53 which allows @xmath48 and @xmath50 to become exponentially small causes @xmath58 to grow . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the mcp picture , no value of @xmath52 leads to avtd behavior . </S>",
    "<S> further mcp qualitative study @xcite indicates that at each spatial point , @xmath48 , @xmath50 , and @xmath58 alternately awaken , causing bounces characteristic of local mixmaster behavior . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations support this prediction with typical behavior shown in fig .  3 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to generalize the plane symmetric gowdy model on @xmath27 by removing one of the killing vectors . </S>",
    "<S> this yields vacuum @xmath4 symmetric models @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , the dynamical degrees of freedom , now called @xmath59 and @xmath60 , no longer decouple from the background described by @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . </S>",

    "<S> the choice @xmath71 defines the collapsing direction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vtd solution as @xmath2 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and the remaining momenta are functions of @xmath65 and @xmath52 but constants in @xmath54 . upon substitution of the vtd solution ( [ u1avtd ] ) into ( [ u1h ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> it is seen immediately that the gowdy - like potential terms @xmath78 become negligible if @xmath79 , @xmath80 , as in gowdy . </S>",
    "<S> the very complicated terms in ( [ u1h ] ) with spatial derivatives have a simple exponential behavior . given @xmath81 , the inverse conformal metric @xmath82 is dominated by @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> examination of the terms in ( [ u1h ] ) shows that all but one of them have the exponential factor @xmath84 the remaining term is @xmath85 now as @xmath2 , the hamiltonian constraint , with the vtd solution substituted in , becomes @xmath86 this restriction means that @xmath87 so that @xmath88 implies the exponential decay of terms with the behavior of ( [ u1vlam ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> models with @xmath89 have the predicted avtd behavior @xcite . ] on the other hand , @xmath50 will decay exponentially only if @xmath90 which is inconsistent with ( [ u1havtd ] ) . thus @xmath50 must increase exponentially if @xmath73 and @xmath76 are positive . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian constraint restriction means that @xmath50 will grow approximately as @xmath91 so that @xmath50 will act as a potential for the @xmath59 degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> a bounce will yield @xmath92 which will cause @xmath48 from ( [ u1v1 ] ) to grow exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> a bounce off @xmath48 will cause the cycle to repeat . </S>",
    "<S> all other variables will remain consistent with the vtd solution . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , this extremely simple picture describes the results of numerical simulations of the full @xmath4 symmetric model einstein equations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of @xmath48 , @xmath50 , and @xmath59 vs @xmath54 at a typical spatial point is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions . _ the asymptotic approach to the singularity of a sequence of increasingly complicated cosmological spacetimes has been examined . </S>",
    "<S> the vtd solution is substituted into the relevant hamiltonian to obtain a prediction as to whether terms not present in the vtd solution become exponentially small . in the homogeneous mixmaster case , we find that no matter what the value of the vtd constants , one of three dominant exponential potential terms will always grow . in the vacuum gowdy case , there are two such potentials at every spatial point and a window , @xmath93 , consistent with avtd behavior . </S>",
    "<S> addition of a magnetic field ( with a suitable change of topology ) removes this window and causes the system to oscillate indefinitely as the three potentials grow and decay . </S>",
    "<S> detailed study shows this to be truly local mixmaster behavior @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> generic @xmath4 symmetric models have oscillations between two rather than three potentials at every spatial point although no value of @xmath94 is consistent with the avtd solution .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that , in the inhomogeneous case , this simplified picture follows from the mcp analysis if the time dependences of a variety of spatially dependent functions are assumed to be negligible compared to the exponentials we have singled out . in every case , this drastic assumption holds true in numerical simulations of the full einstein evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we could evolve toward the singularity using ode s at every spatial point rather than pde s . </S>",
    "<S> thus the bkl conjecture that the generic approach to the singularity is local is very strongly supported . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not yet clear whether , generically , the further conjecture that our observed oscillations are mixmaster is also correct .    for the inhomogeneous models , </S>",
    "<S> the local nature of the dynamics is plausible . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to show that the horizon size goes to zero as @xmath2 in both the gowdy @xcite and @xmath4 cases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the chosen time coordinate , the spatial points causally decouple . </S>",
    "<S> information from other sites , carried through the spatial derivatives , ceases to propagate .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several implications of these results . </S>",
    "<S> first , the local nature of the approach to the singularity means that our choice of cosmological boundary conditions is merely a convenience . </S>",
    "<S> the indicated behavior should arise asymptotically in any generic collapse leading to a spacelike singularity . </S>",
    "<S> second , as bounces occur at different spatial points at different times , the amount of spatial structure in the gravitational waves will increase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> third , these results are certainly consistent with a generic spacelike singularity ( at @xmath3 ) although this was not known before these studies to be a property of @xmath4 symmetric models .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity of our picture despite the generality of the one killing field spacetimes suggests that further generalization is possible . within the models discussed here , </S>",
    "<S> one may for example introduce a scalar field of the type known to suppress mixmaster oscillations in the homogeneous case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> implementation of the mcp analysis leads in all classes of inhomogeneous models studied here to the prediction that the oscillations will be suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions have not yet been checked by numerical simulation .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the generalization to the zero killing field case may be within reach . </S>",
    "<S> while precise , quantitative numerical studies in @xmath95 and @xmath1 dimensions must still come to terms with numerical difficulties caused by the spiky features seen in the gowdy models @xcite , the local nature of the collapse means that the qualitative features can be seen even at coarse spatial resolutions . </S>"
