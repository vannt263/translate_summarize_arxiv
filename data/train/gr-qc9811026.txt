    "recently much progress has been made in understanding the formation of singularities in realistic black holes .",
    "after the seminal work by poisson and israel @xcite , the outcome of several investigations with spherical models ( see @xcite for a general overview ) was that the spacetime develops a null scalar singularity at the cauchy horizon ( ch ) whose subsequent evolution eventually stops at the final spacelike singularity at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in particular the petrov type d component @xmath1 of the weyl curvature diverges exponentially with advanced time at this lightlike hypersurface , although the  measured \" tidal distortion is bounded .",
    "the metric tensor is regular in a suitable local chart adapted to the inner horizon and the metric perturbations are small .",
    "this scenario is likely to be essentially the same in more general contexts than spherical symmetry @xcite , but the structure of the singularity is more complicated then since the square of the weyl tensor @xmath2 is dominated by the radiative component @xmath3 of a petrov type n curvature @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting question whether quantum effects can modify the classical evolution of the fields in a significant way .",
    "as far as the classical evolution is concerned , causality does not permit our ignorance about the correct form of the dynamics in the inner , planckian curvature regions of the interior to infect the description of the overlaying layers in terms of classical general relativity .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath4 is in fact timelike in the interior of a spherical hole .",
    "this picture changes in quantum field theory because in loop calculations even states localized outside the light - cone have an impact on the value of the renormalized quantities .",
    "one can then imagine that the metric fluctuations near the inner horizon modify the infrared region where the weyl curvature is still growing but it has not yet reached planckian levels . in particular it is interesting to see if the presence of some  self - regulator \" mechanism could prevent the local curvature from diverging at the ch .",
    "an indication has been given in @xcite where it has been noticed that the classical divergence of the mass function in an evaporating black hole ( bh ) can be damped out by the contribution of the blueshifted influx of the hawking radiation at late advanced times .",
    "more complete investigations in four dimensions @xcite have been performed in the semiclassical approximation by considering a massless minimally coupled scalar field , but they were inconclusive about the  sign \" of the quantum correction , _",
    "i.e. _ about whether it would lead to a stronger or to a weaker divergence .    the objective of the present investigation is to show that quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field indeed weaken the strength of the singularity at the inner horizon .",
    "this result is obtained by studying the running of the newton constant at large momenta by means of the non - perturbative renormalization - group equation @xcite which governs the scale dependence of the effective average action @xmath5 for gravity @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 is a wilson - type effective action with a built - in infrared ( ir ) cut - off at the mass scale @xmath6 .",
    "the functional @xmath5 is obtained by integrating out the quantum fluctuations with momenta between a fixed ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff @xmath7 and the variable ir cutoff @xmath6 . in this framework , a renormalizable theory with the classical action @xmath8 is quantized by solving the flow equation subject to the initial condition @xmath9 and letting then @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( after suitable renormalization ) .    what makes the effective average action an ideal tool for studying quantum gravity is the fact that this method can also be used in order to renormalization group - evolve ( coarse grain ) the actions of non - renormalizable effective field theories .",
    "in this case one assumes that there is some fundamental theory which has been `` partially quantised '' , _",
    "i.e. _ its quantum fluctuations with momenta from infinity down to a fixed scale @xmath7 have been integrated out already .",
    "this leads to an effective action @xmath12 which , when evaluated in tree approximation , correctly describes all phenomena with typical momenta of the order @xmath7 .",
    "if we are interested in processes at smaller momenta @xmath13 we can construct a new effective action , appropriate for the lower scale , by setting @xmath14 and solving the flow equation for @xmath15 with this initial condition .",
    "it is clear that for effective theories the limit @xmath16 should not be performed ; hence the non - renormalizability of a theory does not pose any problems in this context .",
    "quite generally , the effective action @xmath17  or the average action @xmath5  encapsulates _ all _ physical effects of a given theory .",
    "once we have identified its leading terms for a given range of momenta , no other quantum corrections beyond those which are already contained in the running coupling constants parametrising the approximate form of @xmath5   need to be taken into account . in the case at hand , a truncated derivative expansion in powers of the curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives is a sensible approximation as long as @xmath18 since the terms omitted are suppressed by higher powers of @xmath19 .",
    "( @xmath20 denotes the planck mass . ) within this approximation , the most relevant term in the action is the einstein - hilbert term since it has the smallest canonical dimension . as a consequence ,",
    "the most important effects of quantum gravity are encoded in the running of the associated coupling , i.e. newton s constant .",
    "thus , when we increase @xmath6 from the classical ( _ i.e _ , ir ) domain to larger values in order to explore gravity at smaller distances , the first sign of a non - classical behaviour is a changing value of newton s constant . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the regime of momenta where , on the one hand , the first quantum gravitational effects appear already while on the other hand higher order invariants ( @xmath21 terms , etc . )",
    "are not yet important .    in the following",
    "we shall consider einstein gravity as an effective field theory and we identify the standard einstein - hilbert action with the average action @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is some typical `` observational scale '' at which the classical tests of general relativity have confirmed the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "we assume that also for @xmath24 , _ i.e. _ at higher energies , @xmath15 is well approximated by an action of the einstein - hilbert form as long as @xmath6 is not too close to the planck scale .",
    "the two parameters in this action , newton s constant and the cosmological constant , will depend on @xmath6 , however , and the flow equation will tell us how the running newton constant @xmath25 and the running cosmological constant @xmath26 depend on the cutoff .",
    "their experimentally observed values are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the newton constant defines the planck mass according to @xmath29 .",
    "we fix a scale @xmath30 in such a way that it is still sufficiently below the planck scale so that @xmath15 is not yet very different from the einstein - hilbert action , but is already large enough for quantum gravitational effects to play a role .",
    "we start the renormalization group evolution at the scale @xmath7 with bare parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 which should be thought of as functions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we shall use our result for the function @xmath35 $ ] , in order to study the impact of the scale dependent newton constant on the mass - inflation scenario .    in a sense",
    ", we shall `` renormalization group improve '' the classical metric describing the late - time behavior of the spacetime near the ch .",
    "our method is similar to the following renormalization - group based derivation of the uehling correction to the coulomb potential in massless qed @xcite .",
    "one starts from the classical potential energy @xmath36 and replaces @xmath37 by the running gauge coupling in the one - loop approximation : [ uel ] e^2(k)=e^2(k_0)[1-b(k / k_0)]^-1 , be^2(k_0)/6 ^ 2 .",
    "hereby one may identify the renormalization point @xmath6 with the inverse of the distance @xmath4 because in the massless theory this is the only relevant scale .",
    "the result of this substitution reads [ rea ] v(r)=-e^2(r_0 ^ -1)[1+b(r_0/r ) + o(e^4)]/4r where the ir reference scale @xmath38 has to be kept finite in the massless theory . note that eq.([uel ] ) is the correct ( one - loop , massless ) uehling potential which is usually derived by standard perturbative methods @xcite .",
    "obviously the position dependent renormalization group improvement @xmath39 , @xmath40 encapsulates the most important effects which the quantum fluctuations have on the electric field produced by a point charge .",
    "we argue that analogous substitution @xmath41 with an appropriate @xmath42 yields the leading modification of the spacetime metric .",
    "considering a spherically symmetric , charged bh the metric can be conveniently expressed using the coordinates @xmath43 on the radial two - spaces @xmath44 = _ const _ and the function @xmath45 that measures the area of those two - spheres whose line element is @xmath46 .",
    "the metric element is then @xmath47 by defining the scalar fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 through @xmath50 the einstein equations reduce to the two - dimensionally covariant equations [ einstein ] & & r_;ab+g_ab=-4g_obs r ( t_ab - g_abt ) + & & r-2_r = 8g_obs(t-2p ) where the static electro - magnetic field is generated by a charge of strength @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the stress - energy tensor of the matter field whose two - dimensional trace is @xmath53 and tangential pressure is @xmath54 . from the conservation laws one finds the following two - dimensional wave equation for the mass function [ wave ] & & m=-16 ^ 2r^3g_obst_ab t^ab + 8g_obs f(p - t ) + & & + 4r^2 g_obst-4r^2g_obsr_,at^,a .",
    "this latter equation is the key to understanding the phenomenon of the mass - inflation .",
    "the late time behavior of the external gravitational field produced during the collapse of a star is that of a ( kerr - newman , in general ) black hole of external mass @xmath55 perturbed by a tail of gravitational waves whose flux decays as @xmath56 with @xmath57 for a multi - pole of order @xmath58 . as a consequence of the boundary conditions set at the event horizon ,",
    "the @xmath59 interaction term between the influx and out - flux of gravitational waves scattered from the inner potential barrier triggers a divergent source term for the local mass function @xmath60 .",
    "the outflow can be modelled as a radial stream of light - like material particles because of the infinite blue - shift near the cauchy horizon .",
    "it is possible to show @xcite that near the ch [ www ] m(v , r)~v^-pe^_0 v ( v ) where @xmath61 is the standard advanced time eddington - finkelstein coordinate .",
    "( @xmath62 denotes the surface gravity of the static black hole that characterises the external field configuration . )",
    "it must be observed that in eq.([wave ] ) the strength of the gravitational interactions between out - flux and influx is proportional to the newton constant .",
    "hence small changes in @xmath63 due to renormalization effects are then exponentially amplified by the mass function like in a magnifying lens ! in particular if gravity is asymptotically free the classical divergence of the mass function can be weakened by the decreasing of the newton constant at small distances .    to    in order to discuss this phenomenon in the mass - inflation scenario we consider the model analysed in @xcite for the scalar field collapse although our result should not depend on this particular framework .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic portion of the spacetime at late retarded times ( the  corner \" region near the point h in fig.([corn ] ) ) before the strong focusing region where @xmath64 .",
    "the null kruskal coordinates @xmath65 are thus introduced , being _ 0 u=-(_0 u ) , _ 0 v=-(_0 v ) were @xmath66 are the retarded and advanced time coordinates . in a neighbourood of @xmath67 an approximate analytical solution of the einstein equations and the wave equation for a massless minimally coupled scalar field @xmath68",
    "can be found @xcite .",
    "the explicit asymptotic expression for the metric is [ metric ] & & ds^2 = -2 r_0 r du dv + r^2 d^2 + & & r^2 = r_0 ^ 2 -2g_obs[a(u)+b(v ) ] where @xmath69 is the location of the ch in the static bh spacetime configuration .",
    "the dimensionless functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 are regular at the ch , @xmath72 , but @xmath73 diverges like @xmath74 as @xmath75 while @xmath76 is positive definite and @xmath77 is bounded . even though the metric coefficients and the scalar field @xmath68 are both regular at the ch , the mass function is divergent for @xmath75 being [ mass2 ] m(u , v )    we consider the evolution of the above geometry in the mass - inflating regime starting from a value of the coordinate @xmath78 for which the mass function is already exponentially growing @xmath79 ( we assume @xmath80 in planck units ) but the curvature has not yet reached planckian values .    at this point",
    "we need an explicit expression for the running newton constant .",
    "we use the result obtained in @xcite where , for pure gravity , the evolution of @xmath5 has been obtained in the `` einstein - hilbert approximation '' where only the @xmath81 and @xmath82 operators are considered in the renormalization group flow .",
    "this amounts to truncating the space of all the actions to those of the form [ ansa ] _",
    "k[g,|g]=(16g(k))^-1 d^4x\\ { -r(g)+2(k)}+s_gf[g,|g ] where @xmath83 is the classical background gauge fixing term . for this truncation",
    "the flow equation reads [ evo1 ] & & k _ k _ k[g,|g ] = 12tr + & & -trwhere @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote the background metric , the hessian of @xmath5 with respect to the `` ordinary '' metric argument @xmath87 , and the faddeev - popov ghost operator , respectively .",
    "the operators @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the ir cutoffs in the graviton and the ghost sector , respectively .",
    "they are defined in terms of an arbitrary smooth function @xmath90 ( interpolating between zero for @xmath91 and a constant @xmath92 at @xmath93 ) by replacing @xmath94 with the graviton and ghost kinetic operator , respectively . inside loops , they suppress the contribution from modes with covariant momenta @xmath95 .    upon projecting the renormalization group flow on the two dimensional space spanned by the operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 the functional flow equation becomes two ordinary differential equations for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the equation for the scale - derivative of the running dimensionless newton constant @xmath96 is found to be [ flw ] k_k g(k ) = [ 2+(k)]g(k ) where @xmath97 is an anomalous dimension involving two known functions @xcite of the cosmological constant , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which depend on the choice for @xmath90 .",
    "contrary to the running of the dimensionless gauge coupling @xmath100 in qed , the beta - function describing the running of the newton constant is not universal .",
    "it is scheme dependent even in the lowest order of the loop expansion . in our framework",
    "this is reflected by the @xmath101-dependence of @xmath102 .",
    "to lowest order of an expansion in powers of @xmath19 one may ignore the impact of the running cosmological constant on @xmath103 and set @xmath104 .",
    "thus , returning to physical units and retaining only the leading term of the @xmath19-expansion the solution to eq.([flw ] ) reads [ renorm ] g(k)=g_obs[1-g_obsk^2 + o(k^4/m_p^4 ) ] .",
    "for pure gravity one obtains @xmath105 which assumes the numerical value @xmath106 for a standard exponential cutoff @xcite .",
    "while @xmath107 depends on the shape of @xmath101 , it can be shown that @xmath107 is positive for any choice of this function .",
    "consequently pure gravity is `` antiscreening '' : newton s constant decreases as @xmath6 increases , _",
    "i.e. _ it is large in the ir and becomes smaller in the uv .",
    "eq.([renorm ] ) is believed to be reliable as long as @xmath7 is still below the planck mass .",
    "if @xmath108 the effect , in the renormalised system , of higher curvature invariants such as @xmath21 , @xmath109 or @xmath110 which were omitted from the ansatz ( [ ansa ] ) is indeed small .",
    "in fact , those invariants have been classified accordingly to their anomalous scaling dimension which characterise the linearised renormalization group flow near the gaussian fixed point @xcite .",
    "the result is that the flow in the uv region is determined only by the `` relevant '' operators @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and that any other invariant with a higher canonical dimension is suppressed by additional powers of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we shall then assume that [ domain ] k",
    "< k_uv = m_p / a with @xmath113 a fixed number well above unity .",
    "this defines the domain of validity of our approximation .",
    "it is straightforward to include matter fields . in our model",
    "it might appear natural to keep the electro - magnetic field classical but quantise the full scalar field .",
    "the only effect on the running of @xmath63 is to shift the parameter @xmath107 .",
    "using the same cut - off as above , one finds @xcite @xmath114 which , again , is positive and leads to the same qualitative features as pure gravity .",
    "the running of @xmath63 has dramatic consequences for the mass - inflation scenario .",
    "the leading quantum correction of the metric is obtained by replacing @xmath33 in eq.([mass2 ] ) for the mass function by the running newton constant @xmath25 with an appropriately chosen scale @xmath6 . since @xmath115 for any value of @xmath116 we conclude that _ the quantum corrections tend to damp the increase of the mass function_. this qualitative conclusion is independent of the precise definition of the cut - off @xmath6 .",
    "it is a rather robust results therefore .",
    "we are now going to implement this mechanism in an iterative calculation , where the zeroth - order solution for the metric is substituted into the running of @xmath63 in order to calculate the first - order correction of the metric .",
    "for the sake of simplicity let us now consider the simpler case of the cross - flow model discussed in @xcite .",
    "the first question to be answered is what is the analogue of the identification @xmath40 which we used in qed .",
    "we are looking for a @xmath117-dependent cut - off @xmath42 which respects general coordinate invariance and which measure the typical mass scale set by the curvature of spacetime .",
    "since in the case at hand the metric is spherically symmetric , the natural candidate for the cut - off is the `` coulombian '' component of the weyl curvature @xcite : @xmath118 .",
    "more precisely we use the classical metric ( zeroth - order approximation ) to define the position dependent ir cutoff by [ cih ] k^2(v)=_u \\ { b^2|_2| } = _ u \\ { b^2g_obsm(u , v)/r^3_0 } with @xmath119 another fixed number much larger than unity and the maximum is performed over the region near @xmath120 . here",
    "we are invoking a kind of adiabatic approximation where the use of a position dependent cutoff is justified because the mass function @xmath121 is almost constant on the length scales at which the eigenmodes integrated out are varying .",
    "( a similar approximation has already been used in @xcite in a semi - classical calculation . ) from @xmath122 one obtains a running newton constant as a function of the @xmath123 coordinate [ guv ] g(v)=g_obs where = b^2 _ u \\ { g_obs^3 a(u)/r^4_0 } .",
    "it is now possible to evolve the classical geometry in eq.([metric ] ) by considering the running newton s constant in the einstein equations . within our approximation ,",
    "the improvement amounts to replacing g_obst_ab = g_obst_ab^in(v)+ g_obst_ab^out(u ) with t_ab^imp= g(v)t_ab^in(v)+ g_obst_ab^out(u ) .",
    "this modified energy - momentum tensor is then covariantly conserved since it satisfies @xmath124 .    from the bianchi identities one obtains the following wave equation for the mass function [ wave2 ] & & ( gm ) = -16 ^ 2r^3g^2t_abt^ab+ e^2(g_,a2 r)^;a .",
    "the general solution is uniquely determined once the value of the fields along the characteristic @xmath125 and @xmath78 are given .",
    "asymptotically the improved metric is still of the form ( [ metric ] ) but eq.(8 ) is now replaced by r^2=r^2_0 - 2g(v)b(v)-2g_obsa(u ) . by noticing that @xmath63 approaches its bare value very rapidly one finds that the leading term ( as @xmath75 ) on the right hand side of eq.([wave2 ] ) is now given by the classically divergent @xmath59 contribution",
    "thus , after the inner potential barrier , one finds the solution m(u , v ) ( 1-a)- e^2 g_obs4 r_0 ^ 3aa which replaces the classical expression ( [ mass2 ] ) . inserting the function",
    "@xmath126 one has more explicitly for the leading term [ enns ] m(u , v ) ( 1-av(-(-_0 v))^(p+2 ) ) ( u)v(-(-_0 v))^(p+2 ) this is our main result .",
    "it confirms our earlier conclusion about the damped increase of the mass function within an improved approximation which takes the back - reaction of the metric into account .    a priori it might have appeared equally possible to perform the substitution @xmath127 directly in the einstein equations .",
    "the identification @xmath128 leads to a non - linear equation for @xmath6 that up to @xmath129 is equivalent to @xmath130 which was used before .",
    "however it is important to observe that in this case a decreasing @xmath63 leads to the additional effect of lowering the value of the surface gravity at the inner horizon which , too , damps the increase of the mass function .",
    "it should also be stressed that the above results were obtained by integrating out only the field modes with momenta between @xmath131 and @xmath132 . while lowering the ir cutoff even further",
    "is difficult from the technical point of view ( the adiabatic approximation is not available any longer ) the monotonicity of the function in eq.([renorm ] ) suggests that taking additional modes into account will lead to an even stronger damping of the classical increase of the mass function . on the other hand , by adding further matter fields the antiscreening nature of the gravitational interaction could be destroyed in principle .",
    "@xcite a condition on the number of the various species of fields implying @xmath133 can be read off . )",
    "we nevertheless believe that the qualitative features of our discussion will hold for arbitrary matter systems with @xmath134 .",
    "in particular for the matter system consisting of a massless minimally coupled scalar field considered in this investigation the quantum - corrected geometry is less singular than its classical counterpart .",
    "we have discussed a possible physical mechanism which has the effect of damping the classical increase of the mass function behind the potential barrier inside a realistic black hole .",
    "we believe that this mechanism is operative already for black holes with masses @xmath135 and before the cauchy horizon singularity is reached , _",
    "i.e. _ in a regime of sub - planckian curvatures where it can be calculated reliably .",
    "on the basis of the present investigation we can not make any claim about the fate of the singularity at the ch .",
    "however , one can speculate that if the decrease of @xmath63 continues and that @xmath136 at the ch , the geometry of the spacetime near the late - time portion of the ch is regular with a sub - planckian weyl curvature . in order to settle this issue completely a more complete calculation",
    "is needed and we hope to address this problem in the future .",
