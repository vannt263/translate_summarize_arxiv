    "variability was very early established as a trade mark of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "variability has also been used as a key tool to derive physical properties of agn : characteristic time scales were used to infer sizes of the emitting regions , lags between the ionising continuum and the line response have been used to determine black hole masses ( @xmath0 ) , multi - wavelength light curves have been used to study the geometrical and physical connections between the different regions around the central engine .    the scenario accepted until recently for the interplay of the emitting regions is that variability is driven by the emission from the x - ray corona located close to the central black hole ( e.g. , collin - souffrin , 1991 ; krolik et al .",
    "1991 ; clavel et al . , 1992 ; collier et al .",
    "1999 ; cackett et al .",
    "the negligible optical inter - band lags was early evidence that pointed towards reprocessing of high - energy photons by the accretion disc , where the characteristic distances between the different emitting regions correspond to the light travelling time ( collin - souffrin , 1991 ; krolik et al .",
    "1991 ; clavel et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "later on , the measurement of short lags between the x - ray emission and the optical , and the leading of the x - rays whenever significant lags were determined ( e.g. , edelson et al . , 1996 ;",
    "wanders et al . , 1997 ;",
    "shemmer et al . , 2001 ; desroches et al . ,",
    "2006 ) , lent support to this picture ( see also nandra et al . , 2000 for evidence supporting reprocessing from the correlation between the uv flux and the spectral shape of the x - ray emission ) , since for intrinsic disc variability shorter wavelengths should lag longer wavelength emission by long ( viscous ) time - scales . also , light curves showed that the amplitude of the x - ray variations was much larger than that seen in the optical , which can be explained by the damping of the signal during the disc reprocessing .",
    "however , a full picture of the interplay between the x - ray corona and the disc might not be complete just yet , as new evidence seems to suggest that long term optical variability is driven by accretion rate fluctuations in the disc itself ( see section 3.1 and also arvalo et al . , 2008 , 2009 , and references therein )",
    ".    long term ( @xmath1 years ) , well sampled optical , uv , and x - ray monitoring of agn is available for several sources ( e.g. , breedt et al . , 2010 ; chatterjee et al .",

    "clavel et al .",
    ", 1991 , clavel , wamsteker & glass , 1989 ) .",
    "however , near - ir data of similar quality has been lacking until recently .",
    "the new implementation of robotic observations and queue - based operations of other telescopes is changing this situation rapidly .",
    "suganuma et al .  ( 2006 ) presented high quality optical and near - ir light curves for 4 seyfert 1 galaxies obtained over 3 years of intense monitoring .",
    "the analysis of these observations , together with some other data available in the literature , showed that the lags observed at near - ir wavelengths are in very good agreement with the location of a putative dusty torus whose inner face should be found at the dust sublimation radius , i.e. , at a distance proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 corresponds to the luminosity of the central source .",
    "this behaviour is expected for a torus that intercepts a significant fraction of the near - uv and optical flux from the central source and reradiates it in the near and mid - ir . in this scenario ,",
    "any flux variations in the central source will be followed by variations at these near - ir wavelengths , with a delay that will be characterised by the location of the torus inner face , which corresponds to the distance at which dust no longer sublimates under the strong glare of the central radiation .",
    "near - ir emission , however , can be emitted by the colder regions of an accretion disc itself , although there is no clear theoretical predictions of the real extent of the outer regions of the disc .",
    "kishimoto et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have presented evidence for near - ir disc emission in quasars in polarised flux .",
    "they find that the spectral energy distribution is very close to @xmath4 , as expected for a shakura - sunyaev @xmath5 disc .",
    "more recently landt et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have shown that emission from an accretion disc and hot dust are required to explain the continuum around 1 micron in a sample of agn .    in this paper",
    "we will present near - ir observations for ngc  3783 and mr  2251 - 178 , and argue that we have detected near - ir variability from their accretion discs .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we characterise our targets ; in section 3 we describe the acquisition and analysis of the data ; in section 4 we give estimates for the host contribution to our nuclear photometry ; in section 5 we present our results in the form of light curves , cross correlation analysis , flux - flux plots and spectral energy distributions ; finally , section 6 discusses our findings and the summary is presented in section 7 . in this article",
    "we adopt a concordance @xmath6cdm cosmology with @xmath7 = 70 km / s / mpc .",
    "ngc  3783 is a well studied nearby seyfert galaxy located at a distance of 42 mpc ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "early reverberation mapping campaigns were reported by reichter et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and stirpe et al .",
    "revised results were later reported by onken & peterson ( 2002 ) and peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , finding a black hole mass of @xmath9 .    for mr  2251 - 178 ,",
    "a very nearby quasar ( @xmath10 ) , a black hole mass of @xmath11 was recently reported by wang , mao & wei ( 2009 ) using spectroscopic data and applying the luminosity - radius relation for the broad line region as calibrated by green & ho ( 2005 ) .",
    "we have also obtained spectroscopic data for mr  2251 - 178 using the rc spectrograph on the 1.5 m telescope at ctio and operated by the smarts consortium .",
    "the data were obtained on the 20th of december 2006 and reduced and calibrated in the standard way .    following peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we measure a line - width for h@xmath12 of 4,145 km / s . using our light curves ( presented in section 5.1 )",
    "we determine an average 5100  flux of @xmath13 ergs / s/@xmath14/ . for a distance of 274 mpc",
    ", we obtain a black hole mass of @xmath15 , in complete agreement with the value determined by wang , mao & wei ( 2009 ) .",
    "these estimates are also in agreement with the lack of an observed break in the x - ray power spectrum density , which puts an lower limit to the black hole mass of @xmath16 ( summons et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "optical and x - ray monitoring for ngc  3783 and mr  2251 - 178 were already presented elsewhere ( arvalo et al . , 2008 ; arvalo et al . ,",
    "the analysis of the optical and x - ray light curves showed that while the time delay observed between the x - ray and the optical bands for mr  2251 - 178 was consistent with @xmath17 days , ngc  3783 required that some optical flux was produced about 6 light days away from the region where the x - rays were produced ( arvalo et al .",
    ", 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "crucially , both sources showed that optical long term variations ( time scales of years ) presented very large fluctuations which could not be explained by the reprocessing of the x - ray light curve .",
    "hence , arvalo et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 ) have suggested that the long term variability seen in the optical is driven by the intrinsic fluctuations of the accretion flow and is characterised by the disc viscous time scales .    in this work",
    "we have extended the coverage of the optical light curves by one year for ngc  3783 and two years for mr  2251 - 178 .",
    "the data initial reduction followed the same steps detailed in arvalo et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "the photometry was obtained taking all images to a common seeing and then performing aperture photometry with a diameter of 3.7 arc - seconds .",
    "the j , h , and k observations were obtained between the 1st of december 2006 and the 1st of august 2009 for ngc  3783 , and between the 1st of august 2006 and the 20th of november 2009 for mr  2251 - 178 .",
    "we used the andicam camera mounted on the 1.3 m telescope at ctio and operated by the smarts consortium .",
    "the field of view corresponds to 140 arc - seconds , with a pixel size of 0.274 arc - seconds .",
    "exposure times were 40 seconds in the j band and 20 seconds in the h and k bands .",
    "the mean seeing was @xmath18 , with the smaller values found in the k - band .",
    "the average sampling of the light curves was @xmath19 days with a period of intensive ( @xmath1 daily ) monitoring during the second year of observations for both sources .",
    "simultaneous optical observations in the b and v - bands were also obtained and reduced as outlined above .",
    "the data reduction followed the standard steps of dark subtraction , flat fielding , and sky subtraction using consecutive jittered frames .",
    "the light curves were constructed from relative photometry obtained through a fixed aperture of 2.7 and 3.6 arc - seconds in diameter for ngc3783 and mr2251 - 178 , respectively , after all images were taken to a common seeing by convolving each image with a gaussian of width @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the width corresponding to some of the worst seeing conditions ( dates with even poorest seeing were discarded ) and @xmath22 is the width of each individual image . for ngc",
    "3783 five different comparison stars were used to obtain the relative photometry whenever available . mr  2251 - 178 however , had only one comparison star within the field of view .",
    "photometric errors were computed as the squared sum of the standard deviation due to the poissonian noise of the source and sky flux within the aperture , plus the uncertainty of obtaining the measurement itself .",
    "this last error was estimated as the dispersion in the photometry of the stars available in the field of view between two consecutive exposures and it was found to range from 0.02 to 0.05 in fractional flux .",
    "one component that should be taken into account when studying agn variability is the light contribution within the used aperture from the stellar population of the host galaxy .",
    "high mass sources might be spared from this correction if they have high accretion rates , but for systems with massive black holes and low accretion rates it is now known that the host will also contain a massive spheroid which should be accounted for since the emission from the active nuclei might not completely dominate the total observed flux . in the following subsections we will estimate this contribution for ngc  3783 and mr  2251 - 178 .",
    "ngc  3783 was studied using the acs camera on board the hubble space telescope by bentz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and the galaxy was modelled as a combination of a bulge , disc and bar in the f550 m filter ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the amount of host light in our 3.7  optical apertures at this wavelength corresponds to @xmath24 ergs / s/@xmath25/ , while for the 2.7  near - ir apertures it corresponds to @xmath26 ergs / s/@xmath25/  ( m.  bentz , private communication ) , with more than 95% of this flux coming from the bulge . to extrapolate this measurement at 5100  to near - ir wavelengths we will assume that only the bulge contributes significantly to the measured fluxes and will use the spectral energy distribution of the appropriate stellar population .",
    "the stellar populations in bulges vary as a function of their luminosity .",
    "massive bulges are characterised by old stellar populations which are well represented by a single epoch of star formation ( peletier et al . , 1999 ;",
    "peletier & balcells , 1997 ) , while the colours of less massive bulges found in late type galaxies are better characterised when younger stellar populations are also included ( carollo et al . , 2007 ) . from the determination of the black hole mass in ngc  3783 the mass of the bulge",
    "is found to be @xmath27 ( hring & rix , 2004 ) , at the lower limit of the range in the peletier s sample , and therefore it should be well represented by a stellar population with 1 to 2 times solar metallicities and ages around 9 - 12 gyr .",
    "we have used the simple stellar population models from the work of maraston et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , scaled to the hst measurement at 5100 , to determine the host contributions to the near - ir fluxes .",
    "a correction is introduced to account for the different apertures used during the photometric measurements in the optical and near - ir images .",
    "it is found that , after scaling , the single stellar population model with @xmath28 and 9 gyr contributes less to the near - ir flux than the model with @xmath29 and 12 gyr by a factor of 1.41.5 , while the contributions are nearly equal in the b and v bands .",
    "the final b - band value reported in table 1 corresponds to the average from these two extreme values and agrees within 25%  with the value derived by alloin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) using a similar aperture . for a visualisation of the contributions ,",
    "see section 5.4.1 .",
    ".host contribution within a 2.7aperture in diameter .",
    "all fluxes are in units of ergs / s/@xmath25/ . for ngc  3783",
    "the fluxes represent the average of single stellar populations taken from maraston et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . for mr",
    "2251 - 178 @xmath30-band total bulge flux estimates come from marconi & hunt ( 2006 ) .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our analysis clearly indicates the detection of variable near - ir emission from the disc of mr  2251 - 178 and suggests that some disc near - ir emission is also present in ngc  3783 .",
    "evidence is groing that accretion disc emission is indeed visible in the near - ir regime ( landt et al .",
    ", 2011 ; kishimoto et al . , 2008 ; minezaki et al . ,",
    "in fact , based on the cross - correlation analysis of the optical and j and h - band data for ngc  4395 , minezaki et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argue that the observed variability comes from the outer region of the accretion disk .",
    "in addition , tomita et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have assumed the presence of a variable disc component that extends from the optical to the near - ir to interpret the light curves of mcg  + 08 - 11 - 011 .",
    "they find a sed index for this component of @xmath32 , still consistent with the predicted value of 1/3 .",
    "suganuma et al .  (",
    "2006 ) did not find direct evidence in any of their sources for the presence of near - ir emission arising from the accretion disc .",
    "in fact , their optical versus near - ir flux - flux plots for ngc  5548 , ngc  4051 and ngc  3227 ( their figure 13 ) look like pure scatter diagrams , except for ngc  7469 where some correlation seems to be present . this seems to indicate that in these sources the variable near - ir emission is dominated by the distant large torus , or by the much slower variations of the accretion flow in the outer parts of the accretion disc . on the other hand , in mr  2251 - 178",
    "the variable near - ir emission is dominated by the reprocessing of x - rays by the disc .",
    "uttley et al .  ( 2003 ) already pointed out that the nature of the disc reprocessed emission will depend on the location of those regions of the disc exposed to the x - ray illumination .",
    "the range of temperatures that characterise the reprocessed emission will depend on the thermal structure of the disc , which in turn is determined by the black hole mass and the accretion rate as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , for @xmath35 expressed in eddington units .",
    "furthermore , uttley et al .  ( 2003 ) invoke results from x - ray binaries to argue that the size of the x - ray emitting region , expressed in units of @xmath36 , is constant for all sources .",
    "therefore , for small accretion rates and/or large black hole masses , we expect a cold accretion disc , where the near - ir emitting region will be located at small values of @xmath37 and will be more likely to be exposed to a significant fraction of the x - ray flux .",
    "the opposite situation , a hot accretion disc , is expected for sources characterised by small black hole masses and/or large accretion rates .",
    "the _ fast _ variability observed in different bands , which traces the variations produced by the central x - ray source , therefore , represents a tool that allow us to map the regions being illuminated and heated by x - ray flux .    to test this scenario",
    "we have gathered the values of the black hole masses and accretion rates for our sources and those found in suganuma et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , minezaki et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and kishimoto et al.,(2008 ) .",
    "these are presented in table 5 . for ngc  3783 and mr",
    "2251 - 178 the accretion rates are based on the observed bolometric luminosities , and not on the values determined during our sed fitting .",
    "this is because our determination of @xmath35 only accounts for the direct release of gravitational power into the disc , while the x - ray heating is determined by the observed value of @xmath38 .",
    "however , the high energy emission ( and any released mechanical energy ) is also powered by the gravitational potential energy which ultimately takes the form of a hot corona ( and a mechanical jet ) . since we do not have a prescription to relate @xmath35 with @xmath38",
    ", @xmath38 remains as an extra parameter in the sed models .",
    "as before , measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath35 for ngc  3783 are fairly accurate , while clear uncertainties remain for mr  2251 - 178 . besides , the black hole estimates presented in section 2 , the determination of the bolometric luminosity for mr  2251 - 178 is rather vague : assuming the bolometric corrections computed by marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we find that the b - band luminosity predicts @xmath39 ergs / s , while the 2 - 10 kev luminosity gives @xmath40 ergs / s .",
    "this shows that mr  2251 - 178 is fairly `` x - ray loud '' , with an @xmath41 index of 1.2 ( for a definition of @xmath41 see tananbaum et al . , 1979 )",
    ", close to the edge of the distribution for quasars and local seyferts ( zamorani et al . , 1981 ; grupe et al . ,",
    "hence , there is about one order of magnitude uncertainty in the bolometric luminosity of mr  2251 - 178 , as well as in its accretion rate .",
    "table 5 shows that mr  2251 - 178 is located in the lower part of the distribution of @xmath42 values when compared with local ngc seyferts and , if its lower accretion rate is confirmed , it fits well within the range of @xmath42 values shown by kishimoto s sample of quasars .",
    "however , the power to @xmath43 clearly introduces a weak dependency on @xmath44 , and given the uncertainties involved in these measurements it is still premature to draw firm conclusions .",
    "in fact , ngc  4395 ( for which the detected intra - day near - ir variations also argue in favor of j and h - band disc emission ; minezaki et al . ,",
    "2006 ) , has a value of @xmath42 well consistent with the other ngc galaxies .",
    "hence , even though table 5 could be telling us that mr  2251 - 178 hosts the coolest accretion disc it remains to be tested further whether the combination of these two fundamental parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath35 , is sufficient to fully determine the temperature distribution in thin accretion discs .",
    "as already shown in this work the geometry of the disc ( e.g. , the presence of flaring , humps , or tapering of the disc ) might also play a significant role .",
    "this finding could have important implications for the analysis of other sources with small @xmath42 ratios where the near - ir emission is normally interpreted as a dust emission while it might correspond to emission from the accretion disc .",
    "we have obtained high quality near - ir light curves for two nearby agn : ngc  3783 and mr  2251 - 178 , which are characterised by very different values of their black hole mass .",
    "the light curves track variations on time - scales from a few days up to three years for ngc  3783 and four years for mr  2251 - 178 . from the analysis of these data , together with the results already presented in arvalo et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 ) we find the following :    1 .",

    "2 .   for ngc  3783",
    "the optical and near - ir cross correlation analysis suggests that two emitting regions are present in the j - band emission , one consistent with a short lag and another found much further out .",
    "we identify these regions as the accretion disc and a dusty torus .",
    "the h and k lags ( @xmath45 days ) are consistent with the presence of dust in a torus located at the sublimation radius .",
    "3 .   for mr  2251 - 178",
    "the lags measured between all near - ir and optical wavelengths are consistent with lags of @xmath46 days .",
    "this suggests that the variable near - ir emission arises from the accretion disc in this source .",
    "4 .   from the cross correlation analysis we find no direct evidence for the presence of a dusty torus in mr  2251 - 178 as expected from the delays predicted by the suganuma et al .  ( 2006 ) relation .",
    "we checked that the emission is not due to the presence of beaming emission from a radio jet .",
    "flux - flux plots for both sources are consistent with the findings from the cross correlation results .",
    "the linear relations observed between the optical and near - ir bands in mr  2251 - 178 confirm that the variable near - ir emission originates in the accretion disc .",
    "however , some near - ir excess seen at low optical fluxes might suggest the presence of a dusty torus . 6 .   we determined a satisfactory sed representation for ngc  3783 adopting a model of an @xmath5-disc illuminated by a central x - ray source plus a dusty torus at a distance consistent with the dust sublimation radius .",
    "the model is able to reproduce the optical and near - ir spectral energy distribution as well as other timing constraints .",
