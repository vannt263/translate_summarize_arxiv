    "since seiberg - witten theory was introduced in 1994 , many techniques in @xmath0-dimensional topology have been developed to show that a large class of simply connected smooth @xmath0-manifolds admit infinitely many distinct smooth structures . among them , a knot surgery technique introduced by r.  fintushel and r.  stern turned out to be one of the most powerful tools changing the smooth structure on a given @xmath0-manifold  @xcite .",
    "the knot surgery construction is following : suppose that @xmath3 is a simply connected smooth @xmath0-manifold containing an embedded torus @xmath4 of square @xmath5 .",

    "then fintushel and stern proved that , under a mild condition on @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the knot surgery @xmath0-manifold @xmath12 is homeomorphic , but not diffeomorphic , to a given @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath3 is a simply connected elliptic surface @xmath1 , @xmath4 is the elliptic fiber , and @xmath2 is a fibred knot , then it is also known that the knot surgery @xmath0-manifold @xmath13 admits not only a symplectic structure but also a genus @xmath14 lefschetz fibration structure  @xcite .",
    "note that there are only two inequivalent genus one fibred knots , but there are infinitely many inequivalent genus @xmath15 fibred knots for @xmath16 .",

    "on the one hand , fintushel and stern  @xcite conjectured that the set of all knot surgery @xmath0-manifolds of the form @xmath13 up",

    "some progresses related to the conjecture were obtained by s. akbulut  @xcite and m. akaho  @xcite . but a complete answer to the conjecture for prime knots up to mirror image is not known yet . furthermore , fintushel and stern  @xcite also questioned whether any two in the following @xmath0-manifolds @xmath18 are mutually diffeomorphic or not .",

    "let @xmath26 be a genus five lefschetz fibration structure on @xmath27 .",
    "then , by investigating the monodromy group @xmath28 of @xmath26 , we get the following theorem .",

    "that is , for any @xmath32 with @xmath33 ( mod @xmath21 ) , @xmath34 is equivalent to @xmath35 and therefore @xmath27 is the same symplectic @xmath0-manifold as @xmath36 .",
