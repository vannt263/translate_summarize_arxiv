    "various techniques have been developed for quantum control @xcite , which can be divided into coherent and in - coherent ones .",
    "quantum coherent optimal control is a powerful tool for designing control fields , although finding the control fields is a time - consuming task .",
    "recently , it has found applications in many problems @xcite .",
    "quantum lyapunov control was proposed as a good candidate for quantum state engineering .",
    "it has been well developed in both theory and applications in the last decades @xcite .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite investigated different types of lyapunov functions , schemes of field design and their convergence . in ref .",
    "@xcite , lyapunov control was applied to driving an open quantum system to its decoherence - free subspace , preparing entanglement states , and enforcing adiabatic evolutions .    in quantum lyapunov control ,",
    "the control fields are designed to make the lyapunov function decrease monotonically , while the system is asymptotically steered to a desired state .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system under control takes the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the free hamiltonian which can usually not be turned off .",
    "stand for the external control hamiltonians with @xmath3 the corresponding control fields .",
    "lyapunov control can be understood as a local optimization @xcite with the control fields determined at every instant of time in feedback form .",
    "similar to quantum coherent optimal control , lyapunov control can be used to deal with different forms of hamiltonian systems .",
    "however , the calculation of control fields for lyapunov control is much easier since it does not need iteration .",
    "another merit of lyapunov control is that the shape of control fields is flexible @xcite .",
    "lyapunov control is mostly used to prepare quantum states .",
    "this method can be extended to produce unitary operators ( quantum gates ) in view of its advantages .",
    "sklarz and tannor studied the creation of quantum gates in the subspace of a direct sum or direct product hilbert space by local - in - time control ( lyapunov control ) working in the interaction picture with respect to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of the free hamiltonian @xmath1 , the time - evolution operator can usually not reach a stationary one in the schrdinger picture .",
    "our goal in this letter is to prepare desired time - evolution operators in the schrdinger picture by lyapunov control such that quantum gates might be easier to realize in the laboratory frame .",
    "we use a tracking strategy for engineering time - evolution operators .",
    "the lyapunov function is designed to be a distance between the time - evolution operator @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the target quantum gate . in this way",

    "note that tracking the time - dependent operator @xmath5 in the schrdinger picture is equivalent to tracking @xmath6 in the interaction picture .",
    "however , if @xmath7 in the interaction frame , the evolution operator @xmath8 in the schrdinger picture is generally not @xmath6 and the gate time @xmath9 with @xmath10 is not clear .",
    "therefore , it is more convenient to calculate the field in the schrodinger picture .",
    "the letter is organized as follows .",
    "we present in section 2 the lyapunov function and the design of control fields based on a tracking strategy . in section 3.1",
    ", we demonstrate the implementation of the hadamard gate with a typical single - qubit hamiltonian . in section 3.2 ,",
    "the cnot gate is realized in two - spin systems with the ising and heisenberg interactions .",
    "we show further in section 4 that the time - evolution operator can stay in the local equivalence class of the cnot gate forever with the same control as in section 3.2 .",
    "this is the main difference between the present lyapunov control and the other strategies discussed in the literature @xcite where the aimed quantum gate is obtained at a fixed time .",
    "finally , we summarize our work in section 5 .",
    "our task is to design control fields to realize a target quantum gate ( or a desired family of quantum gates ) by lyapunov control in a closed system .",
    "the dynamical equation for the time - evolution operator @xmath4 is @xmath11 where @xmath1 is the free hamiltonian and @xmath2 @xmath12 are the control hamiltonians with @xmath3 the control fields . at the initial time , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the identity operator . for simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath15 throughout this letter .",
    "we restrict our discussion to finite dimensional quantum systems where all the operators can be represented by @xmath16 matrices .",
    "if the time - evolution operator @xmath4 is driven to @xmath6 ( the target operator ) with all the control fields being turned off , @xmath4 will evolve as @xmath17 which is usually different from @xmath6 at a later time . to be specific ,",
    "consider an @xmath18-dimensional system in the space spanned by the eigenstates of @xmath1 which is written as @xmath19 .",

    "clearly @xmath8 evolves under @xmath1 except the trivial case , @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , one can not asymptotically steer the system to a target operator @xmath6 as @xmath25 .",

    "for example , @xmath45 can be designed to avoid non - zero field at @xmath47 in order to be experimentally feasible .",
    "constant @xmath45 is adopted in this letter for simplicity .",
    "tracking control can be classified by its goals into two categories : trajectory tracking and orbit tracking @xcite .",

    "our lyapunov function is formally designed in the same way as in the trajectory tracking , i.e , @xmath27 with @xmath48 .",

    ", this design will require more complicated calculations due to the minimization of the distance .",
    "we ll show in the following sections that the lyapunov function eq.([eqn : lya ] ) is effective to produce quantum gates .",
    "we then explain how the target operator is obtained . with @xmath59 in mind , when @xmath28 has a good recurrence property , it is clear that @xmath4 will reach @xmath6 precisely at some finite times if @xmath4 is driven into the orbit of @xmath28 .",
    "in the case of nonrecurrent @xmath28 , assume @xmath4 is driven to the orbit of @xmath28 at @xmath60 .",

    "if @xmath62 , we are sure that after a finite time @xmath63 , @xmath64 , the desired operator can still be reached precisely . in addition , it is worth mentioning that the tracked operator @xmath28 is not unique in the sense that all operators in the form of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is a real constant ) are equivalent to @xmath28 .",
    "the parameter @xmath66 can be chosen freely ( positive or negative ) making it easier to drive @xmath4 to @xmath67 @xmath68 such that the desired gate can be reached precisely .",
    "it is easy to see that the orbit of @xmath65 is also @xmath57 according to our definition .",
    "in the circuit model of quantum computation , a quantum gate ( or quantum logic gate ) is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of qubits .",
    "it is the building block of a quantum computer , like the classical logic gate for contemporary computers .",
    "it is proved that any unitary transformation can be decomposed into single - qubit and two - qubit gates @xcite .",
    "thus the two kinds of gate play a fundamental role in quantum computation . in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate how to use the lyapunov method to achieve the single - qubit hadamard gate and the two - qubit cnot gate .",
    "the hadamard gate acts on a single qubit .",

    "however , when implementing a quantum gate , @xmath66 and @xmath74 are known in advance by computer simulation . so the robustness against @xmath66 need not be considered in experiments .",
    "the reason for the sudden change of fidelity is that when @xmath132 , the tracked operator @xmath133 is ineffective which leads to @xmath134 and @xmath135 when @xmath60 is small",

    "in contrast , more operations are needed to realize the cnot gate with the heisenberg coupling @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the heisenberg coupling may be reduced to the ising coupling when the condition @xmath150 is satisfied @xcite .",

    "we apply the proposal to the implementation of the hadamard gate and the cnot gate at some instance of time . besides",
    ", we find that with the ising interaction , the time - evolution operator can be driven into the local equivalence class of the cnot gate and stay in that class forever .",
    "the advantages of the traditional lyapunov control , e.g. , easy and flexible design of control fields , no measurement induced decoherence , will contribute to the implementation of quantum gates . meanwhile , there are some limitations to be improved in our method .",
    "first , the gate time @xmath9 is determined after the simulation which may be inconvenient when the control is applied .",
    "second , our method may not be effective in general to implement other quantum gates or realize quantum gates in other ( complex ) hamiltonian systems . at last , the fact that the evolution operator can be driven into the equivalence class of the cnot gate may not be available with other coupling hamiltonians .",
