    "bootstrap percolation was originally introduced by chalupa , leath and reich @xcite in the context of magnetic disordered systems in 1979 . since then",
    ", it has been studied extensively by physicists and sociologists , mainly due to its connections with various physical models and a variety of applications such as neuronal activity @xcite and jamming transitions @xcite .",
    "bootstrap percolation can be essentially considered as an activation process on networks : ( ) nodes are either active or inactive ; ( ) once activated , a node remains active forever ; ( ) initially , each node is in an active state with a given probability @xmath5 ; ( ) subsequently , inactive nodes become active if they have at least @xmath6 active neighbors ; ( ) nodes are activated in an iterative manner according to the condition in ( ) , until no more nodes can be activated .",
    "this process has been investigated on different kinds of networks including lattices @xcite , trees @xcite , random networks @xcite , and so on .",
    "bootstrap percolation has found applications in modeling the spreading of information @xcite , the propagation of infection @xcite , the adoption of new products and social behaviors @xcite such as trends , fads , political opinions , belief , rumors , innovations and financial decisions .",
    "for instance , one may decide to buy a product when recommended by more than @xmath6 users and trust a message when told by at least @xmath6 neighbors ; cf .",
    "the well - known rule , `` what i tell you three times is true '' @xcite . in this way",
    ", the process leads initially localized effects propagating throughout the whole network .",
    "moreover , a broad range of generalized formulations of bootstrap percolation on social networks are investigated , such as watts model of opinions @xcite , in which @xmath6 is replaced by a certain fraction of the neighbors , and disease transmission models with different degrees of severity of infection @xcite .",
    "real networks are often embedded in space @xcite and social networks are no exception .",
    "previous empirical studies on online social networks @xcite , email networks @xcite and mobile phone communication networks @xcite have confirmed a spatial scaling law , namely , the probability density function ( pdf ) of an individual to have a friend at distance @xmath0 scales as @xmath1 , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "in fact , prior to these empirical observations , kleinberg @xcite has proposed a spatial network model by adding long - range links to a 2-dimensional lattice , and he has proved that when @xmath8 , the structure is optimal for information navigation . recently , hu _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested the optimization of information collection as a possible explanation for the origin of this spatial scaling law .",
    "although extensive studies have shown that the spatial organization can change the dimension , which dominates many important physical properties of networks @xcite , how it influences the spreading process on social networks under the framework of bootstrap percolation remains unclear .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically study bootstrap percolation on kleinberg s network , which is a typical artificial social network , being well - accepted by academic society . setting the size of the giant active component as the order parameter",
    ", we find the distribution of long - range links lengths can change the order of phase transition . in particular , a critical exponent is found to be @xmath9 , above which a hybrid phase transition ( mixed of first order and second order ) is observed .",
    "surprisingly , we find both the first - order and the second - order critical points are constant when @xmath10 , insensitive to @xmath6 and other parameters . when @xmath11 , the second - order critical point increases as the decreasing of @xmath4 . meanwhile , as the decreasing of @xmath4 , there is either a decreasing first - order critical point or the absence of the first - order phase transition , which depends on @xmath6 and other parameters .",
    "these results indicate that the spatial scaling exponent @xmath12 , observed in real social networks , may be resulted from some deep - going principles in addition to the optimization of navigation and information collection , which is not yet fully understood now .",
    ") and one long - range link ( colored black ) . the probability density function of a node to have a long - range link at manhattan distance @xmath0 scales as @xmath13 . for the target node @xmath14 ( colored red ) , when @xmath15 , there are eight candidate nodes ( colored green ) , from which we can choose an uncoupled node @xmath16 to make a connection . for another target",
    "node @xmath17 , we can choose to connect it with @xmath18 when @xmath19.,width=359 ]    kleinberg model @xcite is a typical spatial network model , which has been well justified by empirical data @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "kleinberg s network is constrained on a 2-dimensional periodic lattice consisting of @xmath20 nodes .",
    "in addition to its initially connected four nearest neighbors , each node @xmath14 has a random long - range link to a node @xmath16 with probability @xmath21 , where @xmath4 is a tunable exponent and @xmath22 denotes the manhattan distance , which quantifies the length of the shortest path between node @xmath14 and node @xmath16 , following strictly the horizontal or vertical links in lattices .",
    "since the number of nodes at distance @xmath0 to a given node is proportional to @xmath23 in a @xmath24-dimensional lattice , the probability @xmath25 can be mapped to a probability density function , @xmath26 . in the present 2-dimensional case ,",
    "the probability density function scales as @xmath1 .",
    "an illustration of a 2-dimensional kleinberg s network can be found in figure [ fig1:lattice ] .    in order to numerically implement the spatial scaling law @xmath27 , we add long - range links to a 2-dimensional periodic lattice in a smart way as follows .",
    "first , a random length @xmath0 between 2 and @xmath28 is generated with probability @xmath1 , which ensures the scaling in advance .",
    "second , random segmentations of length @xmath0 to @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the only constraint that @xmath31 are done to determine candidate nodes , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are both integers .",
    "namely , for an uncoupled node @xmath14 with coordinates ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , named target node , all candidate nodes are these with coordinates ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) such that @xmath31 .",
    "the above procedure ensures all candidate nodes at distance @xmath0 from the target node are uniformly distributed .",
    "hence , we can randomly choose an uncoupled candidate node ( i.e. , a node withour any long - range link ) to make an undirected link to target node @xmath14 . in exceptional cases that all candidate nodes have been coupled , we randomly choose an uncoupled node from the whole network to accomplish the linking .",
    "we repeat such procedure for the rest uncoupled nodes until each node of the network has one undirected long - range link such that the degree of each node is exactly 5 .",
    "we focus on the following three indicators : ( ) the relative size of the giant active component ( @xmath36 ) at the equilibrium , i.e. , the probability that an randomly selected node belongs to the giant active component ; ( ) the number of iterations ( @xmath37 ) to reach the equilibrium , which is usually used to determine the critical points for the first - order phase transition @xcite ; ( ) the relative size of the second giant active component ( @xmath38 ) , which is usually used to detect the critical points for the second - order phase transition @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2:sgc ] shows rich phase transition phenomena when taking @xmath36 as the order parameter .",
    "when @xmath10 , @xmath36 shares almost the same behavior and the system undergoes a hybrid phase transition ( see figure [ fig2:sgc](a ) ) .",
    "we can see that @xmath36 has a continue increasing at @xmath39 ( the second - order critical point ) , where the second - order phase transition is present .",
    "in contrast , @xmath36 has a discontinue jump directly from about 0.60 to exact 1 at @xmath40 ( the first - order critical point ) , where the first - order phase transition occurs .",
    "to our surprise , we find that these two critical points are constant when @xmath10 , as indicated by the four overlapping @xmath41 curves in figure [ fig2:sgc](a ) .",
    "when @xmath11 , there is only a second - order phase transition with an increasing @xmath42 as the decreasing of @xmath4 ( see figure [ fig2:sgc](b ) ) . specifically , the second - order critical point is @xmath43 when @xmath44 and @xmath45 when @xmath46 .",
    "although @xmath36 goes up sharper after @xmath5 exceeds @xmath42 as the decreasing of @xmath4 , simulations justify that the curve of @xmath36 is continuous .",
    "that is to say , the type of phase transition is fundamentally second - order when @xmath11 .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) , @xmath37 ( c ) and @xmath38 ( d ) as a function of @xmath5 for different @xmath4 after @xmath47 bootstrap percolation on kleinberg s networks .",
    "two different types of @xmath48 are observed , including a hybrid phase transition and a second - order phase transition .",

    "when @xmath11 , there is only a second - order phase transition with an increasing critical point as the increasing of @xmath4 , where @xmath38 reaches its maximum at different @xmath42 .",
    "dash lines mark identification of critical points .",
    "results are obtained by simulations on networks with size @xmath49 and averaged over 1000 realizations.,width=396 ]    finding critical points via simulations is always a difficult task that requires high precision .",
    "when @xmath10 , where the hybrid phase transition is present , we are able to determine @xmath50 by calculating the number of iterations ( @xmath37 ) in the cascading process , since @xmath37 sharply increases when @xmath5 approaching @xmath50 for the first - order phase transitions @xcite . accordingly , @xmath50 is calculated by plotting @xmath37 as a function of @xmath5 ( see figure [ fig2:sgc](c ) ) .",
    "we can see that @xmath37 reaches its maximum at the same @xmath5 when @xmath10 , which is the evidence that @xmath40 is constant .",
    "analogously , by plotting the size of the second largest giant active component @xmath38 as a function of @xmath5 , we can precisely identify @xmath42 @xcite , at which @xmath38 reaches its maximum ( see figure [ fig2:sgc](d ) ) .",
    "it is found that @xmath42 increases as @xmath4 decreases , as @xmath39 ( @xmath10 ) , 0.176 ( @xmath44 ) and 0.256 ( @xmath46 ) .     and",

    "firstly , we fix @xmath12 to determine @xmath50 . on the one hand",
    ", there is an intersection for curves of @xmath36 at @xmath53 under different network sizes ( see figure [ fig3:points](a ) ) , which can be considered as the critical point according to the finite scale analysis @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the corresponding @xmath37 reaches its maximum at @xmath54 when @xmath55 ( see figure [ fig3:points](b ) )",
    ". combining these two evidences , a more accurate first - order critical point is identified as @xmath62 .",
    "conversely , we fix @xmath57 to determine @xmath60 . from figure [ fig3:points](c )",
    "we can see that @xmath36 has two phases : exact 1 or around 0.58 when @xmath63 .",
    "there is a strong evidence that @xmath36 undergoes a first - order phase transition .",
    "if the increasing of @xmath36 is continuous , it is impossible to observe such gap between the two phases . from figure [ fig3:points](d ) , we can see that the corresponding averaging @xmath37 reaches its maximum at @xmath64 .",
    "combining these two evidences , we precisely identify the critical exponent as @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , the critical point for @xmath66 should be constant , otherwise we can not observe the separation of two phases in figure 3(c ) for a fixed value @xmath57 .",

    "we find that the varying of @xmath4 , which dominates the distribution of long - range links lengths , can change the order of phase transition .",
    "two kinds of phase transitions are observed , consisting of the second - order phase transition and the hybrid phase transition .",
    "overall , @xmath71 is confirmed to be the critical exponent , above which the hybrid phase transition ( the region labeled ii ) is present .",
    "once again , we confirm that both the first - order and the second - order critical points for hybrid phase transition are constant as @xmath40 and @xmath39 when @xmath10 . in the first - order phase transition region ,",
    "@xmath48 curves are overlapped , suggesting that the properties of bootstrap percolation on kleinberg s spatial networks have no difference if @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath11 , the first - order phase transition is absent , leaving @xmath36 undergoes only a second - order phase transition ( the region labeled i ) with an increasing critical point as the decreasing of @xmath4 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath42 is about 0.259 when @xmath69 , where all long - range links lengths are 2 .",
    "we have tested our findings for different threshold parameters @xmath6 and the number of long - range links associated with a node @xmath72 .",
    "some significant observations are robust : ( i ) the existence of critical point @xmath73 , above which a hybrid phase transition occurs with two constant critical points , whose values depend on @xmath6 and @xmath74 , and ( ii ) the existence of a second - order phase transition when @xmath11 , with an increasing critical point @xmath42 as the decreasing of @xmath4 . in contrast , in some parameter spaces , the first - order transition could be observed even when @xmath11 , but with a decreasing critical exponent @xmath50 as the decreasing of @xmath4 .",

    "we have studied bootstrap percolation on spatial networks , where the distribution patterns of long - range links are found to be able to affect the order of phase transition . in particular , we find a robust critical point @xmath82 , above which the @xmath48 curves are almost the same and the two critical points are constant .",
    "such result indicates that the topological properties of kleinberg s networks are close to each other when @xmath85 in 2-dimensional space .",
    "in fact , the critical point @xmath12 has been empirically observed in many real networks @xcite , which may be resulted from complex self - organizing processes toward optimal structures for information collection @xcite and/or navigation @xcite . since the cascading processes of kleinberg s networks show almost the same features when @xmath10 , this critical point @xmath82 is indeed corresponding to the structure with the smallest average geographical length of links , which can exhibit as effective spreading of information as networks with even longer shortcut links .",
    "this is to some extent relevant to the principle of least effort in human behavior @xcite .",
    "our results are also relevant to the control of information spreading . for example , when @xmath86 , if we would like to make as more as possible people to know the information , the optimal choice of the fraction of initially informed people should be @xmath87 , since larger initially informed population provides no more benefit ( as shown in figure 2(a ) ) but requires higher cost .",
    "furthermore , we expect to verify our findings in an analytical way based on kleinberg s networks , spatial embedded random networks @xcite and multiplex networks @xcite .",
    "besides , to assign each node one long - range link is a high - cost strategy when generating spatial networks , we leave individualized number of long - range links associated with each node and partial spatial embedding as future works .",
