    "einstein s general relativity has proved to be the simplest theory for successful understanding of a number of experiments and observations . still , on the other hand , there seem to be growing indications that a yet - to - be - discovered scalar field might play fundamental roles in cosmology .",
    "a list of the possible sources include the one expected from higher - dimensional theories of gravitation such as superstring / m theory and a scalar field ( a volume modulus ) which couples to 4-dimensional gravity after compactification , also those in the context of the brane world scenario .",
    "we may reasonably expect that realistic consequences of these hypotheses can be implemented in terms of the scalar - tensor theory proposed first by jordan @xcite , developed later by brans and dicke @xcite .",
    "one of the recent focuses of the scalar field is aimed particularly at the origin of the dark energy which appears to be required from the observed acceleration of the universe , with the renewed interest of today s version of the cosmological constant problem , culminating to the twin questions ; fine - tuning problem and the coincidence problem .",
    "we argued @xcite that the scalar - tensor theory is precisely that causes the behavior , @xmath0 realized numerically by @xmath1 @xcite , where @xmath2 is today s age of the universe in units of the planck time @xmath3 , hence preparing another simple implementation of the scenario of the decaying cosmological constant as discussed in @xcite and @xcite .    before reaching conclusions to be compared with observation , however , we must go through certain complications including details on the choice of the conformal frames among other things .",
    "also many consequences derive from leaving the brans - dicke model @xcite , as required ultimately by a single technical aspect on the attractor nature of the cosmological solutions .",
    "this motivated us to develop a general framework of studying dynamics of the system including the scalar field taking the unique roles of the conformal transformation properly into account .",
    "after a brief introduction of the action of the scalar - tensor theory in both conformal frames , the jordan and the einstein frames in section ii , we enter section iii to develop a formulation in the einstein frame in which we may trace how the cosmological solutions evolve in two - dimensional phase space .",
    "we assume the presence of the exponential potential of the scalar field corresponding to the simple cosmological constant in the jordan frame .",
    "it is crucially important to make a right choice of the new extended time - coordinate other than the conventional cosmic time . also of central importance",
    "is to deal with self - autonomous systems .    in subsection iii -",
    "a we discuss the fixed points in phase space .",
    "we show that there are two different sets of fixed points : one ( fp1 ) is for the well - known universe of scalar - field dominance , and the other ( fp2 ) represents a new type of the universe in which the matter fluid energy is scaled to the potential of the scalar field because of the coupling with the matter fluid .",
    "we find that the universe of the latter type always expands in the same way as the radiation - dominant universe in the einstein frame . in subsection iii - b , we present the stability analysis and the behavior of the attractor solutions .",
    "flows of trajectories in phase space are illustrated for the examples taken from the radiation - dominant universe .",
    "basically the same analysis will be repeated in section iv now in the jordan frame .    in section",
    "v we generalize the argument to the power - law potential with a monomial of the scalar field multiplied by the cosmological constant chosen in the preceding section in the jordan frame .",
    "we find a new type of inflation at the fixed point fp2 even for the potential which is too steep to cause inflation without the coupling with the matter fluid .",
    "section vi is devoted to the concluding remarks .    in appendix",
    "a , we discuss the effect of the curvature term not included in the preceding sections . in the subsequent three appendices , we add related discussions on the accelerating universe .",
    "appendix b reveals the presence of a complication in the numerical analysis in the jordan frame , while in appendix c we discuss the attractor nature of the scale - invariant model as an alternative to the brans - dicke model .",
    "the final appendix d will be devoted to offering another simplified approach to the power - law potential .",
    "we discuss cosmology in the scalar - tensor theory of gravitation .",
