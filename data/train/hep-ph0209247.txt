    "then , we further investigate its properties by comparing four kinds of local potentials : 1 ) the one which gives the same scattering phase shift as that of the original nonlocal potential , 2 ) the one which gives the same born phase shift , 3 ) the energy - dependent potential obtained from the wave function , and 4 ) the energy - dependent potential obtained by using the wkb method .",

    "( [ eq : u0re ] ) , when @xmath131 is small , the potential at @xmath101 increases by @xmath163 , which is 0.46@xmath109 .",
    "though one has to add the contribution from the interaction to see the energy dependence of the repulsive core of the two - baryon systems , it is interesting to see that the short - range part of the potential may move by a large amount as the energy increases . above about @xmath157 @xmath152 ,",
    "the potential gradually decreases .        the phase shift given by this energy - dependent local potential from the wkb method",
    "is plotted in figure [ psvedep](a ) .",
    "overall feature is well simulated by this potential . the momentum where the sign of the phase shift changes , however , becomes smaller .",
    "the deviation from the original one comes from the approximation used to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : edep2 ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ eq : edeprl ] ) , but not from the wkb method . this is confirmed by employing the born approximation for each potential in eq .",

    "we plot the wave function from the energy - dependent potential by wkb method for the @xmath45 case in figure [ wfn2a ] .",
    "the wave function is similar to the original one in spite of the deviation found in the phase shift , probably because the size of the potential is rather small .",

    "the potential has attractive pocket in the short range region with a barrier around @xmath164 fm . both of the barrier and the attractive pocket becomes smaller as the energy increases .",
    "the phase shifts for @xmath166 @xmath152 of the @xmath143 case are shown for in figure [ psvedep](b ) .",

    "( [ eq : edeprl ] ) .    the wave function from the energy - dependent potential by wkb method for the @xmath143 case in figure [ wfn2b ] .",
    "the wave function at @xmath157 @xmath152 is similar to the nonlocal one . on the other hand ,",
    "that of @xmath156 @xmath152 deviates largely because the resonance occurs at the lower energy .",
    "pauli - blocking effect on the kinetic term is investigated by employing the quark cluster model .",
    "the effect can be expressed by a potential which is highly nonlocal .",
    "it is found that the pauli - blocking effect does not cause a simple attraction or repulsion . in order to see this point ,",
    "we have calculated the phase shifts for two cases , namely , the one where the normalization factor @xmath44 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu ] ) ) is larger than 1 and the other case where @xmath44 is smaller than 1 . in the first case ( @xmath45 , which corresponds to the two - nucleon @xmath80-wave channel ) ,",
    "the phase shift is attractive at low energy region while it becomes repulsive as the energy increases . in the second case ( @xmath143 , which corresponds to @xmath141n(@xmath142=3/2,@xmath80=1 ) ) , the phase shift is repulsive at low energy region while it becomes attractive as the energy increases .",
    "these behaviors of the phase shifts can be understood in the following way . since the pauli - blocking changes the degrees of the mixing between the incoming wave and the 0@xmath0 state of the inter - cluster wave function , the behavior of the resulting effect above the energy of the 0@xmath0 state is different from that in the lower energy - region .",
    "we also look into the properties of this nonlocal potential by constructing four kinds of local potentials : 1 ) the one which gives the same scattering phase shift as that of the original potential , 2 ) the one which gives the same born phase shift , 3 ) the one with energy dependent potentials obtained from the wave function , and 4 ) the one with energy dependent potentials obtained by the wkb method . it is found that the behavior of the equivalent local potentials depends strongly on the size of the pauli - blocking effect .    in the channel where the pauli - blocking effect is small ( @xmath45 ) , the former two local potentials , which are very similar to each other ,",
    "simulate the nonlocal potential well even for the off - shell behavior .",
    "the energy dependent potentials given by the wkb method can also be obtained and found to increase as the energy increases .    on the other hand , where the pauli - blocking effect is large ( @xmath143 ) , the off - shell behavior of the equivalent local potential is very different from the original one .",
    "it is because the local potential simulates the almost - forbidden resonance by having a deep attractive pocket at the very short range with a large barrier .",
    "therefore it is very difficult to simulate the on- and off - shell behavior of the nonlocal potential simultaneously in terms of the local potential .",
    "however , if we keep the main part of the nonlocal potential , namely , the term coming from the @xmath1-@xmath5 component , the rest terms can be nicely simulated by a local potential not only for the on - shell but also for the off - shell behaviors .",
    "we have also calculated the energy - dependent potential by the wkb method and found that it becomes complex potential at some area . for the higher energy ,",
    "the obtained potential is real .",
    "there we also find an attractive pocket and a barrier , both of which disappear as the energy increases .",
    "the preset work indicates that in a certain channel the nonlocal treatment is essential .",
    "the place where the off - shell features become important , such as the baryons in nuclei , it should be checked whether the use of a local potential is appropriate or not . for this purpose ,",
    "nonlocality in the contribution from the interaction between quarks should also be considered .",
    "it is also interesting to see the situation in coupled - channel systems , which is now underway .",
