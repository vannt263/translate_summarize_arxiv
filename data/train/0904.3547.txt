    "two of the most important scales in physics are the planck scale ( @xmath12  gev ) and the weak scale ( @xmath13  gev ) , and there is a longstanding problem in explaining the disparity between these scales .",
    "the traditional view is to adopt @xmath14 as _ the _ fundamental scale and attempt to derive @xmath15 through some dynamical mechanism ( e.g. renormalization group evolution ) . in recent years , however , a new framework with a diametrically opposite viewpoint has been proposed , in which @xmath15 is instead the fundamental scale of nature  @xcite .",
    "d - brane string compactifications with low string scale and large extra dimensions allow a definite representation of this innovative premise  @xcite .    tev - scale superstring theory provides a brane - world description of the standard model ( sm ) , which is localized on membranes extending in @xmath16 spatial dimensions , the so - called d - branes .",
    "gauge interactions emerge as excitations of open strings with endpoints attached on the d - branes , whereas gravitational interactions are described by closed strings that can propagate in all nine spatial dimensions of string theory ( these comprise parallel dimensions extended along the @xmath17-branes and transverse dimensions ) .",
    "the apparent weakness of gravity at energies below few tevs can then be understood as a consequence of the gravitational force `` leaking '' into the transverse compact dimensions of spacetime .",
    "this is possible only if the intrinsic scale of string excitations is also of order a few tevs .",
    "should nature be so cooperative , a whole tower of infinite string excitations will open up at this low mass threshold , and new particles of spin @xmath18 follow the well known regge trajectories of vibrating strings : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the regge slope parameter that determines the fundamental string mass scale @xmath21    in a series of recent publications  @xcite we have computed open string scattering amplitudes in d - brane models and have discussed the associated phenomenological aspects of low mass string regge recurrences related to experimental searches for physics beyond the sm at the lhc . in this work",
    "we extend our previous discussion in three directions .",
    "the first is a calculation of non - resonant @xmath22- and @xmath23-channel exchanges for the dominant @xmath24 subprocess contributing to hadronic dijets .",
    "the second is a calculation of stringy contributions to @xmath25 monojet , @xmath25 dilepton + jet , and @xmath26 trijet , which parallels our previous analysis of @xmath27 + jet  @xcite .",
    "the third is an update of our dijet analysis to asses the range of discovery of stringy resonances in the first run of the lhc at 10  tev center - of - mass energy .",
    "we consider the extensions of the sm based on open strings ending on d - branes , with gauge bosons due to strings attached to stacks of d - branes and chiral matter due to strings stretching between intersecting d - branes  @xcite . to develop our program in the simplest way",
    ", we will work within the construct of a minimal model in which we consider scattering processes which take place on the ( color ) @xmath28 stack of d - branes , which is intersected by the ( weak doublet ) @xmath29 stack of d - branes , as well by a third ( weak singlet ) @xmath30 stack of d - brane .",
    "these three stacks of d(3+p)-branes entirely fill the uncompactified part of space - time and wrap certain @xmath31-cycles @xmath32 inside the compact six - dimensional manifold @xmath33 . in the bosonic sector , the open strings terminating on the @xmath28 stack contain the standard gluons @xmath34 and an additional @xmath35 gauge boson @xmath36 ; on the @xmath29 stacks the open strings correspond to the weak gauge bosons @xmath37 , and again an additional @xmath38 gauge field .",
    "so the associated gauge groups for these stacks are @xmath39 @xmath40 , and @xmath30 , respectively ; the physical hypercharge is a linear combination of @xmath41 @xmath38 , and @xmath30 , plus in general a forth @xmath42 , which is not relevant for the following discussion .",
    "the fermionic matter consists of open strings , which stretch between different stacks of d@xmath17-branes and are hence located at the intersection points .",
    "concretely , the left - handed quarks are sitting at the intersection of the @xmath43 and the @xmath44 stacks , whereas the right - handed @xmath23 quarks comes from the intersection of the @xmath43 and @xmath45 stacks and the right - handed @xmath46 quarks are situated at the intersection of the @xmath43 stack with the @xmath47 ( orientifold mirror ) stack .",
    "all the scattering amplitudes between these sm particles , which we will need in the following , essentially only depend on the local intersection properties of these d - brane stacks .",
    "such intersecting d - brane models involve at least three kinds of generic mass scales .",
    "first , of course , there is the fundamental string scale , given in ( [ ms ] ) in terms of the slope parameter @xmath20 .",
    "second , compactification from ten to four dimensions on an internal six  dimensional space of volume @xmath48 defines a mass scale : @xmath49 third , wrapping the color stack @xmath43 and the weak stack @xmath44 of d@xmath17-branes ( we are neglecting the other stacks for the moment ) around the internal @xmath31-cycles @xmath50 defines two volumes @xmath51 of these sub - spaces and their associated masses @xmath52 : @xmath53 in order to streamline our discussion of kaluza - klein and string winding modes associated to internal @xmath31-cycles we make a simplifying assumption that they are `` isotropic '' _",
    "i.e_.  one needs only one scale to characterize each @xmath31-cycle .",
    "these three types of fundamental dimensional parameters of d - brane models are linked to 4d physical observables in the following way : first , the 4d planck mass given by @xmath54 determines the strength of gravitational interactions . here",
    ", the dilaton field @xmath55 is related to the string coupling constant through @xmath56 .",
    "thus , for a string scale @xmath57 , the volume of the internal space @xmath33 needs to be as large as @xmath58 .",
    "second , the 4d gauge couplings of the strong and weak interactions are given in terms of the volumes @xmath51 as @xmath59 again for a string scale @xmath57 and using the known values of the strong and weak gauge coupling constants : @xmath60 and @xmath61 at the string scale ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) we can compute the volumes of the internal cycles , assuming weak string coupling . to be specific , we choose @xmath65 , and",
    "then we obtain : @xmath66    the string mass scale @xmath67 and the volumes @xmath51 of the internal cycles are closely related to the masses of those stringy particles that can be possibly seen at the lhc .",
    "first , there is the infinite tower of open string regge excitations of the known sm particles .",
    "these are completely model independent , i.e. independent of the compactified dimensions .",
    "they have the same quantum numbers under the sm gauge group as the gluons and the quarks , but in general higher spins , and their masses are just square - root - of - integer multiples of the string mass @xmath67 .",
    "the first regge excitations of the gluon @xmath68 and quarks @xmath69 will be denoted by @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the first excitation of the @xmath36 ( the extra @xmath71 boson tied to the color stack ) will be denoted by @xmath72 .",
    "only one assumption will be necessary in order to set up a solid framework : the string coupling must be small for the validity of perturbation theory in the computations of scattering amplitudes . in this case , black hole production and other strong gravity effects occur at energies above the string scale , therefore at least the few lowest regge recurrences are available for examination , free from interference with some complex quantum gravitational phenomena .",
    "in fact , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , some basic properties of regge resonances like their production rates and decay widths are completely model - independent .",
    "second , in any d - brane compactification there is an infinite tower of internal open string kk excitations of the sm fields along the d@xmath17-branes .",
    "these particles have sm quantum numbers and , if the internal cycles are isotropic , their masses can be written as @xmath73 where the integer @xmath74 labels individual kk mass levels .",
    "note that these levels may be degenerate : for instance , the lowest kk level is typically @xmath31-fold degenerate in orientifold compactifications . using the same value for the string coupling constant we can , using eqs.([vol ] ) and ( [ mkkvol ] ) ,",
    "compute the masses of the first ( @xmath75 ) strong and weak kk excitations for two possible brane scenarios , namely iia orientifold with intersecting d6-branes ( @xmath76 ) and iib orientifolds with wrapped d7-branes ( @xmath77 ) : @xmath78 the presence of these kk modes is a generic property of d - brane models however their masses and their couplings to the sm particles depend on the details of the compactification manifold . depending on the internal topology , there is also the possibility of charged winding states around internal 1-cycles inside @xmath79 .",
    "if they exist , e.g. in toroidal - like compactifications , their masses are proportional to the radii of the wrapped cycles : @xmath80 typically the parameter @xmath81 is an integer and accounts for winding numbers .",
    "more generally , @xmath81 may also be a positive real number comprising further details of the d ",
    "brane setup like intersection angles or displacement . here",
    "again , one expects a certain degeneracy in each level .",
    "finally , in addition to the ( universal ) regge , kk and winding modes , which are charged under the sm , there typically exist several other neutral particles , like transverse kk modes , several moduli scalars and other closed string states .",
    "however , these states interact only gravitationally , _",
    "i.e. _ at string one  loop , with the sm fields , and hence are not relevant for lhc physics .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  ii presents an overview of all formulae relevant for the @xmath2- , @xmath22- , and @xmath23-channel string amplitudes of lowest massive regge and kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations leading to dijets .",
    "armed with the full - fledged string amplitudes of all partonic subprocesses , in sec .",
    "iii we study the main features of the dijet angular distributions and we elucidate how future measurements of these distributions can provide a potent method for distinguishing between different compactification scenarios . in sec .",
    "iv we study the various final - state topologies arising in the @xmath82 jet channel .",
    "we show that , for @xmath83  tev , monojet , trijet , and dilepton plus jet configurations could provide corroborative evidence for regge excitations in d - brane models . in sec .  v we quantify signal and background rates of regge recurrences in the early lhc run , operating at 5  tev per beam .",
    "we show that dijet signals of string excitations at the lhc may be so large that they could be exposed to in the early days of running .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .  vi .",
    "the physical processes underlying dijet production in @xmath84 and @xmath85 collisions are the scattering of two partons @xmath86 , producing two final partons @xmath87 that fragment into hadronic jets .",
    "the corresponding @xmath88 scattering amplitudes @xmath89 , computed at the leading order in string perturbation theory , are collected in ref .",
    "the amplitudes involving four gluons as well as those with two gluons plus two quarks do not depend on the compactification details and are completely model - independent .",
    "all string effects are encapsulated in these amplitudes in one `` form factor '' function of mandelstam variables @xmath90 ( constrained by @xmath91 ) : @xmath92 the physical content of the form factor becomes clear after using the well - known expansion in terms of @xmath2-channel resonances @xcite : @xmath93,\\label{bexp}\\ ] ] which exhibits @xmath2-channel poles associated to the propagation of virtual regge excitations with masses @xmath94 .",
    "thus near the @xmath74th level pole @xmath95 : @xmath96 in specific amplitudes , the residues combine with the remaining kinematic factors , reflecting the spin content of particles exchanged in the @xmath2-channel , ranging from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .    in the following",
    "we isolate the contribution to the partonic cross section from the first resonant state .",
    "the @xmath2-channel pole terms of the average square amplitudes contributing to dijet production at the lhc can be obtained from the general formulae given in ref .",
    "@xcite , using eq.([nthpole ] ) . however , for phenomenological purposes , the poles need to be softened to a breit - wigner form by obtaining and utilizing the correct _ total _ widths of the resonances  @xcite .",

    "one possibility is to have the qcd kaluza - klein threshold above the string scale , @xmath140 , with other cycles being larger , _",
    "i.e_. @xmath141 .",
    "this is certainly consistent with @xmath142 , _",
    "i.e. _ , with the qcd coupling being the strongest one",
    ". however , it is not possible to accomplish the suppression of _ all _ kaluza - klein particles in this way , for the following reason .",
    "near @xmath143 , poisson resummation in @xmath128 brings the volume factor @xmath144 which converts the string coupling @xmath134 into @xmath145 and exposes the ( unphysical ) @xmath23- channel poles at the masses @xmath146 associated to kaluza - klein excitations of electro - weak vector bosons ( possibly winding along the qcd cycles ) . thus the same volume hierarchy that lifts the qcd kk threshold beyond the string scale brings down the winding states of electro - weak gauge bosons below the string scale .",
    "the `` consolation prize '' is that the corresponding amplitudes come with the smaller electro - weak coupling @xmath145 .",
    "in general , any hierarchy will leave some kk or winding states below the string scale .",
    "we find that quark - quark scattering amplitudes , which do not exhibit resonant behavior in the physical domain of kinematic variables ( except for the massless @xmath22- and @xmath23-channel poles ) , are particularly sensitive to a possible hierarchy of various compactification cycles because kk and winding modes can produce a considerable `` continuum '' background below the string threshold . in order to obtain a rough numerical estimate of such effects , we assume @xmath147 and take the @xmath148 limit of eq.([fgfun ] ) , keeping only the contribution of the lightest excitations of electro - weak bosons : @xmath149 the factor @xmath150 takes into account a possible degeneracy of the lowest level while @xmath151 takes into account the effects of finite thickness of the brane intersections .",
    "any realistic model must contain d - branes with at least three extra spatial dimensions , therefore it is reasonable to set @xmath152 .",
    "d - brane thickness effects are also model - dependent , , with @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the angle between electro - weak and qcd stacks .",

    "but they are exponentially suppressed in the limit @xmath156 . in our numerical analysis",
    ", we will be considering @xmath157 , assumming that such kk scale is sufficiently low for ignoring the effects of d - brane thickness and setting @xmath158 .",
    "futhermore , we set @xmath159      as discussed in the introduction , the gauge group associated with the color and electroweak stacks are @xmath162 and @xmath40 .",
    "these extra @xmath71 s are a source of dramatic differences in the scattering amplitudes from the field theoretic expectation .",
    "a striking example of this can be seen in the @xmath163 process described by eqs .",
    "( [ qq ] ) and ( [ f27 ] ) .",
    "the first term in ( [ f27 ] ) , the `` 1 , '' describes @xmath22-channel gluon exchange of an @xmath164 gluon , whereas the second term is the contribution from the @xmath23-channel exchange of a charged @xmath165 @xmath166 .",
    "what is apparently missing is the @xmath22-channel exchange of the neutral @xmath167 , which is certainly present in the @xmath165 field theory .",
    "the source of this effect can be traced to cancelations of the @xmath38 and @xmath165 contributions . in ref .",

    "furthermore , the kinematic factor @xmath182 supplies the corresponding @xmath183 pole term .",

    "* analyses of the various final - state topologies arising in the @xmath291 jet channel show that , for @xmath292  tev , monojet , trijet , and dilepton plus jet configurations could provide corroborative evidence for regge excitations in d - brane models .",
    "* excitation cross sections for regge recurrences in the early lhc run , operating at 5  tev per beam are sizeable .",
