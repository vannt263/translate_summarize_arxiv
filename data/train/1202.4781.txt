    "the study of the solutions corresponding to the electrical impedance equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the conductivity and @xmath2 denotes the electric potential , is fundamental for the proper understanding of a wide variety of boundary value problems , that posses special relevance in different branches of mathematical physics . among many important problems , it is particularly interesting the one corresponding to the electrical impedance tomography , because of its importance in applied physics and engineering . as a matter of fact , only taking into account the medical imaging applications , no doubts remain about its relevance .    the study of this inverse problem , correctly posed in mathematical terms by a.p .",
    "calderon @xcite , is based upon iterative methods that employ solutions of the forward problem , attempting to fulfil a certain boundary condition ( usually upcoming from physiological measurements ) , by introducing variations in the conductivity function at every step , in order to reduce the difference between the theoretical @xmath2 and the measured one ( see e.g. , the classical work @xcite ) .    yet",
    ", the mathematical complexity of ( [ int:00 ] ) posed so strong challenges , that the electrical impedance tomography remained only as an alternative medical imaging technique , seldom considered among the basic clinical applications .",
    "as a matter of fact , the electrical impedance tomography is still considered an ill posed problem .    in this direction ,",
    "the mathematical foundations dedicated to this topic , perhaps received one of the most important contributions when v. kravchenko in 2005 @xcite , and independently k. astala and l. pivrinta in 2006 @xcite , discovered that the two - dimensional case of ( [ int:00 ] ) was completely equivalent to a special kind of vekua equation @xcite , which had been deeply studied in a variety of works , been the most important those published by l. bers @xcite and by i. vekua @xcite .",
    "the list of novel works arising after such discovering , is as long as it is interesting .",
    "still , it shall be pointed out that just some of them are dedicated to the engineering applications , since it is not clear how to model a wide variety of physical phenomena , in order to make them susceptible to be analysed by means the modern theory of pseudoanalytic functions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this work intends to make a positive contribution in this direction .",
    "already in @xcite was posed a basic idea for interpolating values of conductivity within bounded domains , in order to obtain a certain class of analytic representations : two - dimensional separable - variables functions , one of the keys to fully applied the novel mathematical methods into engineering problems .    in this work ,",
    "a more general methodology is posed , based upon the main conjecture arising from @xcite . starting with some examples for which the conductivity functions are known in exact form , the elements of the pseudoanalytic function theory are used , for the first time , to approach solutions of the forward boundary value problem for ( [ int:00 ] ) , considering conductivity distributions upcoming from geometrical figures .",
    "even the full set of examples is provided for a circular domain , the results can be extended to a wide variety of bounded domains .",
    "thus , the methods provided along these pages , could well be ready for studying images corresponding already to physical experimental models .",
    "following @xcite , let the complex - valued functions @xmath3 satisfy the condition @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the complex conjugation of @xmath6 : @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the standard imaginary unit @xmath9 .",
    "thus , any complex - valued function @xmath10 can be expressed by means of the linear combination of @xmath6 and @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are purely real functions .",
    "two complex functions that fulfil ( [ pre:00 ] ) shall be called a _ generating pair _ @xmath15 .",
    "bers @xcite introduced the @xmath15-derivative of the function @xmath10 according to the expression : @xmath16 but this derivative will exist if and only if @xmath17 here @xmath18 notice that these operators are classically introduced with the factor @xmath19 , but it will result somehow more convenient to omit it int his work .    introducing the functions @xmath20 the expression ( [ pre:01 ] ) of the @xmath15-derivative will turn into @xmath21 as well the condition ( [ pre:02 ] ) can be written as @xmath22    the functions defined in ( [ pre:03 ] ) are called the _",
    "characteristic coefficients _ of the generating pair @xmath15 , and the functions @xmath10 satisfying the condition ( [ pre:05 ] ) are named @xmath15-pseudoanalytic .",
    "indeed , the equation([pre:05 ] ) is know as the _ vekua equation _",
    "@xcite , and in many senses is the foundation of the present work .",
    "the following sentences were originally presented in @xcite and @xcite , and they have been slightly adapted for the purposes of this paper .",
    "[ th:00 ] the elements of the generating pair @xmath15 are @xmath15-pseudoanalytic : @xmath23    let @xmath24 be a non - vanishing function within a bounded domain @xmath25 .",

    "let @xmath32 be a set of generating pairs , and let every @xmath33 be a successor of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the set @xmath35 is called a generating sequence . moreover , if there exist a number @xmath36 such that @xmath37 the generating sequence is said to be periodic , with period @xmath36 .    finally ,",
    "if @xmath38 , the generating pair @xmath39 will be embedded into the generating sequence @xmath35 .",

    "l. bers also introduced the concept of the @xmath28-integral of a complex - valued function @xmath10 .",
    "the detailed conditions for its existence can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath28 be a generating pair of the form .",

    "specifically , if we consider the @xmath28-integral of the @xmath28-derivative of @xmath10 , we will have : @xmath53 here @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is a fixed point in the complex plane . but according to the theorem [ th:00 ] , the @xmath28-derivative of @xmath6 and of @xmath11 vanish identically , thus the expression ( [ pre:09 ] ) can be considered as the @xmath28-antiderivative of @xmath56 .",
    "[ def:00 ] the formal power @xmath57 belonging to the generating pair @xmath34 , with formal degree @xmath58 , complex constant coefficient @xmath59 , center at @xmath55 , and depending upon @xmath54 , is defined according to the expression : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are complex constants that fulfil the condition : @xmath63 the formal powers with higher degrees are calculated according to the recursive formulas : @xmath64 where @xmath65 notice the integral operators in the right side of the last expression are @xmath34-antiderivatives .",
    "the formal powers posses the following properties :    1 .",
    "every @xmath66 is an @xmath34-pseudoanalytic function . 2 .",
    "let @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are real constants .",
    "the following relation holds @xmath70    let @xmath10 be an @xmath34-pseudoanalytic function .",
    "then it can be expressed by means of the so - called taylor series in formal powers : @xmath71 since any @xmath34-pseudoanalytic function @xmath10 accepts this expansion , this is an analytical representation for the general solution of the vekua equation ( [ pre:07 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the two - dimensional case of the equation ( [ int:00 ] ) : @xmath72 as it has been shown in several previous works ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , if @xmath1 can be expressed by means of a separable - variables function @xmath73 introducing the notations @xmath74 the equation ( [ int:00 ] ) will turn into the vekua equation @xmath75 for which the functions @xmath76 conform a generating pair . from ( [ eie:00 ] )",
    "it is easy to see that this pair is embedded into a generating sequence with period @xmath42 , because @xmath24 is separable - variables , according to theorem [ th:01 ] .",
    "the possession of an explicit generating sequence , allows the construction of the formal powers ( [ pre:10 ] ) , so we can approach any solution for ( [ eie:01 ] ) , which will be closely related with the solutions of ( [ int:00 ] ) according to the relations ( [ eie:00 ] ) .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "one special and very important relation between the solutions of ( [ int:00 ] ) and of ( [ eie:01 ] ) was elegantly posed in @xcite , and this idea will play a central role in the present work .",

    "the last statement implies that any boundary condition @xmath82 , imposed for the solutions @xmath2 of ( [ int:00 ] ) , can be approached according to the expression : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are real constants .",
    "summarizing , when a separable - variables conductivity function @xmath1 is given within a bounded domain @xmath86 , and a boundary condition @xmath82 is imposed for the solution of ( [ int:00 ] ) , it will be always possible to construct a finite set of functions , subset of ( [ eie:03 ] ) , such that @xmath87^{2}dl<\\epsilon , \\label{eie:04}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "one of the main objectives of this work is to contribute into the construction of a new theory for the electrical impedance tomography problem .",
    "hence it is natural to search for the mathematical tools that will allow us to fully apply the modern pseudoanalytic function theory into the analysis , e.g. , of medical images .",
    "this means that it is necessary to introduce interpolation methods that , given a set of conductivity values defined into a bounded domain on the plane , can reach separable - variables functions .",
    "one of the first approaches in this direction was posed in @xcite , and it was properly analysed in @xcite . indeed",
    ", the last reference is completely dedicated to prove the following assessment .",
    "[ con:00 ] @xcite let @xmath1 be a function defined within a bounded domain @xmath90 , possessing discontinuities only of the first kind .",

    "a simplified illustration of the procedure for the construction of such piecewise function , is provided along in figure 1 , and a brief explanation of the central ideas will be provided now .    for simplicity , we will consider hereafter the domain @xmath86 as the unitary circle , noticing that all postulates can be extended to a wide set of bounded domains , that are of special interest in many branches of applied mathematics , physics , and engineering .",
    "the first step is to divide the domain @xmath86 into a number @xmath93 of subsections , as shown in the figure [ fig : eie00a ] . along a strait line crossing every subsection , parallel to the @xmath94-axis , we will collect a number @xmath95 of conductivity values , in order to introduce an interpolating function @xmath96 depending only upon the spatial variable @xmath94 .",
    "we will posses then a set of @xmath93 interpolating functions , one for every subsection , as shown in figure [ fig : eie00b ] .",
    "finally , we state that the conductivity function in every subregion will have the separable - variables form @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the number of the subregion , @xmath99 is the common @xmath100-coordinate of all points collected in the @xmath98-subregion , and @xmath101 is a positive real constant such that @xmath102 .",
    "the postulate remains a conjecture because not any formal extension of the theorem posed in @xcite , about the completeness of the set ( [ eie:03 ] ) , is known for the case of piecewise separable - variables functions within bounded domains .",
    "yet , the full set of examples presented in @xcite shows that the representation ( [ eie:05 ] ) is useful for solving the dirichlet boundary value problem of ( [ int:00 ] ) , since the numerical calculations succeed to approach the boundary conditions provided by known exact solutions , for a variety of conductivities that were both separable - variables and non separable - variables by definition .",
    "this property will be now extended for analysing conductivities upcoming from geometrical distributions , precisely as those employed in physical measurements @xcite . to achieve this",
    ", we will consider a limit case of the conjecture [ con:00 ] that will result specially useful for these classes of conductivities .",

    "[ pro:00 ] every conductivity function @xmath1 , defined within a bounded domain @xmath25 , and possessing only discontinuities of the first kind , can be considered the limit case of a piecewise separable - variables conductivity function @xmath103 of the form ( [ eie:05 ] ) , when the number @xmath93 of subsections , and the number @xmath95 of collected values at every subsection , tend to infinity .",
    "this is @xmath104 moreover , since @xmath105 where @xmath98 is the number of the subsection , it follows from theorem [ th:01 ] , that the generating sequence corresponding to this limit case , employed for numerically approaching the formal powers , will be periodic with period @xmath47 .",
    "let us consider that @xmath86 has been sectioned into @xmath93 subdomains @xmath106 , by employing the set of equidistant @xmath94-axis parallel lines @xmath107 since @xmath86 coincides with the unitary circle , it can be described by the union of @xmath93 subdomains , defined according to the expressions",

    "@xmath112 it immediately follows that @xmath113 this implies that every @xmath114 will be confined into a segment of a parallel line to the @xmath94-axis .",
    "indeed , when the @xmath115 , @xmath86 can be represented by the set of the line segments @xmath116    beside , since the number @xmath95 of conductivity values , collected along the line @xmath117 within every @xmath114 , also tends to infinite , not any interpolation method will be required for obtaining the @xmath118 functions .",
    "they will simply coincide with the original values of the function @xmath1 over the elements of the set ( [ eie:08 ] ) .",
    "finally , from ( [ eie:07 ] ) , it follows that @xmath119 which , according to the last sentence of the theorem [ th:01 ] , will provoke that the corresponding generating sequence , employed to numerically approach some of the formal powers ( [ eie:03 ] ) , will be periodic with period @xmath47 .",
    "we now analyse a selected set of analytic conductivity functions for which exact solutions are known , in order to examine the effectiveness of the method posed in proposition [ pro:00 ] .",
    "thereafter , we will consider conductivity distributions upcoming from geometrical distributions , whose analytical representation is , in general , unknown , imposing certain boundary conditions that will help us to appreciate the behaviour of the technique in this special and important cases .",
    "a detailed description of the numerical methods used to approach the solution , that fulfil the boundary condition of every example , can be found in @xcite .",
    "since we are considering the unitary circle , and taking into account the validity of the expression ( [ eie:04 ] ) , that as a matter of fact is a lebesgue integral - type operator , let us introduce an inner product for the elements of the finite set    @xmath120    according to the formula @xmath121 where @xmath89 , and @xmath122 it follows that we can obtain a set of @xmath123 orthonormal functions @xmath124 , such that we can approach an imposed boundary condition @xmath82 according to the expression @xmath125 where @xmath126 are real constant coefficients .",
    "notice that the apparent lose of one base function is because , by virtue of the definition [ def:00 ] , we have @xmath127 thus @xmath128 .",

    "this case was selected because of the variations of conductivity that take place within the unitary circle .",
    "unfortunately , for avoiding the indetermination of the tangent functions contained into the particular solution ( [ ns:02 ] ) , we could only consider the case @xmath135 .",
    "an illustration of this conductivity is given in the figure 2 .",
    "within the unitary circle.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : ns00 ]    the number of points located around @xmath51 , when imposing the boundary condition , does not necessarily has to coincide with the number @xmath136 of orthonormal functions , as it is shown in @xcite , where the collocation method is employed . nevertheless , on behalf of simplicity , this work will consider @xmath137 equally distributed points around the perimeter of the unitary circle , and @xmath138 base functions @xmath139 .",
