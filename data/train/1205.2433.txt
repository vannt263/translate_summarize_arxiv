    "percolation is one of the most studied phenomena in statistical physics since it is closely related to several phase transitions in a wide range of systems . as a typical interdisciplinary subject",
    ", the literature shows contributions of researchers from different areas as mathematics , physics , civil engineering , soil science , hydrology etc . treating a wide range of problems from infiltration and porous flow to jamming and glassy transitions , passing by order - disorder models and magnetism @xcite .",
    "a definition to percolation could be simply stated as following : considers a regular two - dimensional square lattice ( @xmath3 ) in each the vertex are connected by bonds which are present with probability @xmath4 ; with we start with one single bond occupied and randomly sort a new bond to connect two neighbors sites , eventually a large cluster will span along the entire system and we say that the system has percolate .    despite its simplicity",
    ", several open problems still challenge any theoretical treatment ; for example , the exact value for the threshold percolation probability , @xmath0 , for the regular lattice in three dimensions is not known , and even the continuity of the probability density function at @xmath0 still is an open problem ( for general facts in percolation see @xcite . the major importance in determine the percolation threshold and how it depends on the dimensionality of the space , @xmath5 , is due to the link between percolation and phase transitions in natural systems .",
    "several emergent phenomena arise near to the critical point , where power - law and fractal behaviors are observed .",
    "most of these phenomena could be explained considering the cluster size distribution of similar components along the system , and percolation plays a major role to understand the mechanism involved in these natural processes .    in the recent years",
    ", a particular attention was paid in literature on the study of irregular lattices , or complex networks .",
    "a central characteristic of these networks is an inhomogeneous distribution of bonds , or links , by node , and even a wide distribution of bond lengths .",
    "hence , a natural question arises : what is the percolation threshold and how it behaves in function of the network parameters ?",
    "several works @xcite have studied this problem , but most of them have focused the applications , _ e. g. _ , the ising model in complex networks @xcite . here , we present a more generic study of this problem from the percolation theory point of view",
    "; we introduce a percolation model with multiple bond ranges extending the usual bond percolation definition in the square lattice : we draw a bond to connect two sites in the lattice randomly chosen among a list of available sites within a given range .",
    "thus , by means of this generalization of the standard model we expect to unveil possible hidden features which arise when we combine several bond ranges , and expect to shed some light in the problem of percolation in more complex networks .",
    "our primary aim is to verify a very recent conjecture from de lima et al @xcite which states that the percolation threshold should be a decreasing function of the second range , when two bond ranges , @xmath6 , are available , and theorem 1 in @xcite which states that the @xmath0 value in this case converges to the bond percolation threshold in a @xmath7 hypercubic lattice in the limit of @xmath8 going to infinite .",
    "it worth to mention that add a new bond range is equivalent to increase the freedom degrees of the system , thus an operation analogous to increase the spatial dimension @xmath5 .",
    "here , we present an extensive numerical study of the percolation threshold , @xmath0 , for two - range , @xmath6 , and three - range , @xmath9 , bond percolation models . in the three - range model ,",
    "the predicted value when @xmath10 and @xmath11 , is the percolation threshold of the @xmath12 hypercubic lattice .",
    "surprisingly , the numerical results have shown a non - monotonic behavior for specific combinations of @xmath8 and @xmath13 which are not predicted by the theory .",
    "the paper is structured as following : in order to well state the problem and present the analytical conjectures , we present the model definition and the theoretical predictions in the limit of diverging ranges in the next section .",
    "the numerical procedure and simulation results are discussed in the following and we drawn some conclusions and perspectives at the final section .",
    "let @xmath14 be a graph with a countably infinite vertex set @xmath15 .",
    "consider the bernoulli site percolation model on @xmath16 which associates to each vertex the values 1 ( `` occupied '' ) and 0 ( `` vacant '' ) with probability @xmath4 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "this can be done considering the probability space @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the @xmath21-algebra generated by the cylinder sets in @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the product of bernoulli measures with parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we denote a typical element of @xmath22 by @xmath24 .    given two vertices @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we say that @xmath25 and @xmath26 are connected in the configuration @xmath24 if there exists a finite path @xmath27 of occupied vertices in @xmath15 , such that @xmath28 and @xmath29 belongs to @xmath30 for all @xmath31 .",
    "we will use the short notation @xmath32 to denote the set of configurations where @xmath26 and @xmath25 are connected .    for a given vertex @xmath25 ,",
    "the cluster of @xmath25 in the configuration @xmath24 is the set @xmath33 .",
    "we say that the vertex @xmath25 percolates when the cardinality of @xmath34 is infinite ; we will use the following standard notation @xmath35 .",
    "once @xmath25 fixed , we define the percolation probability of the vertex @xmath25 as the function @xmath36\\mapsto [ 0,1]$ ] with @xmath37 .",
    "the percolation threshold ( or critical point ) , @xmath38 , is defined by @xmath39 ; \\theta(p)=0\\}~.\\ ] ]    from now on , the vertex set @xmath15 will be @xmath40 and for each positive integer @xmath8 define @xmath41 let s define the graph @xmath42 that is , @xmath43 is the @xmath44 equipped with nearest neighbors bonds and long range bonds with length @xmath8 parallel to some coordinate axis .",
    "observe that @xmath43 is a transitive graph , hence the function @xmath45 does not depend on @xmath25 and we write only @xmath46 to denote @xmath47 on the graph @xmath43 .    consider the sequence , @xmath48 , of the percolation thresholds of the graphs @xmath43 . in @xcite ( see theorem 1 ) , it is proven that @xmath49 that is , the percolation threshold of @xmath43 converges to the percolation threshold of the hypercubic ( nearest neighbor ) lattice in @xmath50 dimensions .",
    "it is also conjectured @xcite that the sequence @xmath48 is non increasing in @xmath8 .",
    "one goal of this work is to simulate long range percolation on the graph @xmath51 in @xmath52 .",
    "these simulations , as described in the next section , show that @xmath53 goes to @xmath54 monotonically , confirming the theorem 1 and the conjecture in @xcite .",
    "theorem 1 and the conjecture in @xcite can be generalized for bond percolation with multiple ranges . given a sequence @xmath55 with @xmath56 , consider now the graph @xmath57 as @xmath58 .",
    "that is , @xmath57 is @xmath44 decorated with all bonds parallel to each coordinate axis with lengths @xmath59 in this case theorem 1 of @xcite states that @xmath60 and the conjecture says that the probability of percolation on the graph @xmath57 is non decreasing in each variable @xmath61 .    in this work",
    ", we also perform simulations in the case @xmath62 , considering bonds with three different ranges 1 , @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "the results support the theorem 1 and the conjecture in @xcite ( in this case , @xmath13 should be a multiple of @xmath8 ) .",
    "one interesting feature displayed by simulations is that the percolation threshold is not monotone in @xmath8 , with @xmath13 fixed .    .",
    "note that there is 6 short - range bonds ( a - f ) with the same length as the central bond , and 8 long - range bonds ( 1 - 8 ) .",
    "the sites connected to the central bond are filled with different gray levels , depending on the range of the bond linked to the site . [",
    "fig : fig01 ] ]",
    "to 6 values of @xmath63 . note that all curves tend to cross at the same point .",
    "considering two consecutive system sizes , we measure the ordinate value of the crossing point .",
    "the inset shows the crossing values obtained in function of the inverse of the geometric mean between the system sizes , @xmath64 .",
    "the independent term of the linear fit correspond to the best estimative for the percolation threshold to a infinite system size , and matches perfectly with the exact value @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig : bond1r ] ]    in this section we present the numerical approach used in the simulations .",
    "we consider a square two - dimensional regular lattice as the site substrate of the model .",
    "when a link to a given range is open , two sites in a column , or in a line , will be connected to each other forming a bond - see figure [ fig : fig01 ] . for each bond , besides to the six neighbors in the same range , there are eight neighbors consisting of bonds of another length .",
    "thus , in the 2-range version of the model there are 14 neighbors and , in the 3-range , 22 neighbors to be taken into account for every new bond opened .",
    "the algorithm used to estimate the percolation threshold is based on the work of newman and ziff @xcite . basically , we label each bond of the lattice assigning the first @xmath66 natural numbers to bonds of unitary length ( where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the system size ) ; the labels @xmath69 to @xmath70 are assigned to the range @xmath8 , and so on .",
    "thus , we enumerate all the possible bonds to be opened in the system from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the number of ranges considered .     bond percolation model , with @xmath74 .",
    "the plot shows the value of @xmath75 considering 6 values of @xmath76 .",
    "the inset shows the finite size analysis used to obtain the best estimative for the percolation threshold at the infinite system ( see the caption of figure [ fig : bond1r ] ) .",
    "this procedure is repeated for each value of @xmath8 considered in this version of the model , and the dependence of the threshold percolation in function of @xmath8 is shown in figure [ fig : pc2r ] .",
    "[ fig : bond2r ] ]    in this way , each realization consists of a random permutation in the list of the bonds to be opened , varying the occupation probability , @xmath4 , from 0 to 1 . after",
    "each bond is open , the percolation condition is tested using the modified hoshen - kopelman algorithm to identify the clusters @xcite .",
    "the probability of a given site to belong to the infinite cluster is then estimated from the simulated data using the normalization procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the code was developed in c and purebasic @xmath77 languages .",
    "purebasic @xmath77 code developed by m. schnabel is procedure - oriented and 1000 samples of a system with @xmath78 , single range percolation model , takes around two minutes to run in an amd athlon x64 1.9 ghz and 3 gbytes ddr2 ram machine .",
    "it is about @xmath79 faster then the similar c implementation .    in order to validate the code developed ,",
    "we initially consider the bond percolation model limited to a single range , in a square lattice of linear extension @xmath68 , with periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "we simulate 1000 realizations for each system size , @xmath80 , and calculate the probability of a given site belongs to the infinite cluster , @xmath75 , figure [ fig : bond1r ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : bond2r ] we show the corresponding calculation for the two - range bond model considering @xmath74 .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 or @xmath9 the 2-bond and 3-bond models , respectively , where @xmath81 .",
    "the percolation criterion used assumes that the infinite cluster arises when there is a path of connected bonds crossing the entire system , vertically and horizontally , not using the periodic boundaries .",
    "although the particular choice used for this criterion , we believe that we would get qualitatively identical results even for other choices , as discussed in the next section",
    "figure [ fig : bond2r ] presents the procedure used estimate the percolation probability to the 2-range model @xmath6 , with @xmath74 . considering different values of @xmath8 , it is straightforward the calculation of @xmath82 for increasing @xmath8 , which is shown in figure [ fig : pc2r ] .",
    "the limiting value for @xmath10 is @xmath83 , close to the expected value for the bond percolation threshold at the @xmath7 hypercubic lattice - @xmath84 @xcite as stated by theorem 1 @xcite .",
    "thus , we can conclude from this plot that the percolation threshold exhibits a monotonic dependence on @xmath8 , supporting the conjecture in @xcite , and confirming the prediction for the limit @xmath10 stated by theorem 1 .",
    ", for 2-range bond models , with increasing range @xmath8 .",
    "there is no justification for the fit function used and the line is only to guide the eyes .",
    "the limit value of @xmath0 is obtained from the fitting parameter @xmath85 .",
    "[ fig : pc2r ] ]    the results for the 3-range model are shown in figure [ fig : pc3r ] .",
    "we consider five different values to @xmath13 , and all the possible @xmath8 between 1 and @xmath13 .",
    "all results are shown in figure [ fig : pc3r ] .",
    "we can observe some striking features : first , there is a clear downward trend of @xmath0 with increasing @xmath13 . to @xmath13",
    "fixed , generally @xmath0 decreases with @xmath8 , except when @xmath8 approaches to @xmath13 , or to the half - value of @xmath13 .",
    "this trend was observed for @xmath13 even , odd or prime .",
    "for @xmath86 a curious feature appeared : the value of @xmath0 increases about @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we do not have a good explanation for this match so far .",
    "the increase to @xmath89 can be also be attributed to the correspondence with @xmath86 , as 32 is multiple of 8 ; however , for ranges of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , for example , a similar effect was not observed , discarding this conjecture .",
    "considering the curves for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , they all behave similarly , with @xmath0 decreasing with @xmath8 except for @xmath8 around to @xmath13 or @xmath94 . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the increasing at @xmath94 is more discreet , but occurs between @xmath96 and @xmath97 , since the half - value of @xmath13 is not an integer .",
    "the curves for @xmath86 and @xmath98 show different features .",
    "we observe that the decrease of @xmath0 with @xmath8 is more subtle , but the increasing at @xmath13 and @xmath94 is quite evident .",
    "the peaks observed at @xmath99 are unexpected and not well understood for the moment .",
    "the limit value of @xmath100 around to @xmath101 , approaches to the bond threshold percolation value at @xmath12 hypercubic lattice , @xmath102 @xcite , which is expected when the two long ranges tend to infinity .",
    ", for 3-range bond models , in function of the range @xmath8 ; five different curves corresponding to increasing @xmath13 are shown .",
