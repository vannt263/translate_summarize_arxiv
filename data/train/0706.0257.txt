    "vibro - impacting systems are interesting examples of non - linear dynamical systems , exhibiting new levels of complicated dynamics due to their non - smoothness and have important industrial applications , see dibernardo2006 and references therein .",
    "research in this field was initiated by studies of impacting linear oscillators @xcite - fo1994 as well as closely related accelerator models of particle physics originating from the fermi model @xcite - @xcite .",
    "a very characteristic feature of such systems is the presence of non - standard bifurcations such as border - collisions @xcite - @xcite and grazing impacts @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .",
    "such events often lead to complex chaotic motion , see @xcite for a review of border - collision and grazing bifurcation phenomena .",
    "little work was done , however , on basins of attraction of different attractors typically coexisting in impacting systems .",
    "early results were obtained in wh1987 , wh1992 , no1992 .",
    "it seems however , that the structure of basins of attraction , especially in the case of coexistence of grazing dynamics and periodic orbits , deserves a further study .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate dynamics near the grazing manifold and basins of attraction for a motion of a material point in a gravitational field colliding with a moving motion - limiting stop .",
    "typical example of such dynamical system , related to the fermi model , is a small ball bouncing vertically on a vibrating table @xcite - @xcite . since evolution between impacts",
    "is expressed by a very simple formula the motion in this system is easier to analyze than dynamics of impact oscillators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section of this paper a one - dimensional motion of a material point in a gravitational field ,",
    "colliding with a limiter , representing unilateral constraints , is considered .",
    "it is assumed that , at impact , there is an inelastic rebound with coefficient of restitution @xmath0 @xcite__. _ _ next , the poincar section is defined and the return map , describing evolution from an impact to the next impact , is derived generalizing and extending our previous results @xcite . in section @xmath1",
    "we find periodic points and determine their stability . in section @xmath2 the grazing manifold",
    "is computed .",
    "it turns out that the poincar map is not well defined on the grazing manifold .",
    "however , we demonstrate that the map can be continued to the whole grazing manifold after appropriate regularization procedure , except from some critical points .",
    "then the nonlinear equation for time of the next impact is approximately solved and dynamics is linearized in the vicinity of the grazing manifold .",
    "it is shown that on the grazing manifold there are trapping as well as forbidden regions which are determined explicitly .",
    "finally , basins of attraction are studied in section @xmath3 .",
    "more exactly , we investigate boundary between basins of grazing dynamics and periodic motion which , for large velocities , becomes very complicated .",
    "let us consider motion of a material point moving vectically in a gravitational field and colliding with a moving motion - limiting stop , representing unilateral constraints .",
    "let motion of the point in time intervals between impacts be described by equation:@xmath4where @xmath5 , while motion of the limiter is expressed as:@xmath6with known function @xmath7 .",

    "the coefficient of restitution is a measure of the elasticity of the collision between the material point and the limiter , and is also a measure of energy dissipated during a collision .",
    "the coefficient of restitution can be determined experimentally or computed on the basis of a specific model of collisions . in the present work we shall assume that @xmath17 is known and constant .",
    "it follows from the dynamics that @xmath18 is a continuous function of time while @xmath19 , continuous within all time intervals @xmath20 , is subject to discontinuous changes in time instants @xmath21  described by the impact equation ( impact2 ) . by @xmath22 , @xmath23 we understand the left - sided and right - sided limits of @xmath24 for @xmath25 , respectively , for every @xmath26 . in what follows",

    "equations similar to ( [ map ] ) were derived in @xcite for position of the limiter in the special form @xmath69 and correct stability conditions for fixed points of the map were determined .",
    "however , the authors did not use the non - dimensional variables as in ( [ mapfinal ] ) or ( [ mapxv ] ) and hence their map contained redundant control parameters .",
    "moreover , they did not compute the map for the velocity just after the impact , @xmath23 , for which the important inequality @xmath70 or ( [ condition2 ] ) holds , but for the velocity just before the impact , @xmath71 .",

    "the map ( [ map(holmes ) ] ) was studied theoretically ho1982 while experimental results were reported in @xcite .",
