    "internal gravity waves , outcome of perpetually agitated density - stratified oceans , are known to play a critical role in the dynamics of our planet s energy balance : they absorb energy to form , carry energy over long distances as they propagate , and release energy where they break @xcite .",
    "the latter phenomenon usually gives rise to considerable mixing ( c.f .",
    "* ) whereby nutrients also get distributed , which is vital for a wide range of marine life @xcite .",
    "more than a century long research has shed a lot of light on various features of internal gravity waves .",
    "nevertheless , many aspects of their inception and fate is yet not well understood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , the precise mechanism that transfers energy from longer waves to the high - frequency part of the spectrum , where internal waves are more prone to breaking , is yet a matter of dispute . aside from linear processes such as interaction of internal waves with the seabed topography and",
    "sloped continental shelves , several nonlinear instability mechanisms have also been put forward .",
    "for instance , we now know that internal waves may undergo instability due to triad resonance .",
    "all discovered destabilizing mechanisms for an internal wave ( few named above ) , however , have one thing in common that they require some type of perturbations in order to get initiated .",
    "these perturbations can come from , for instance , seabed corrugations or presence of other waves forming resonance triads .    here",
    ", we show that there are internal gravity waves in the ocean that are _ inherently _ unstable , that is , they simply can not sustain their form . through the mechanism studied here , specific internal waves _ naturally _ ( without requiring any perturbation ) give up their energy _",
    "permanently _ to their higher harmonics through a one - way irreversible harmonic - generation resonance mechanism .",
    "consider the propagation of internal waves in an inviscid , incompressible , adiabatic and stably stratified fluid of density @xmath0 , bounded by a free surface on the top and a rigid seafloor at the depth @xmath1 .",
    "let s define a cartesian coordinate system with @xmath2-axes on the mean free surface and @xmath3-axis positive upward .",
    "newton s second law , conservation of mass , and conservation of energy provide five equations for the evolution of the components of the velocity vector @xmath4 , density @xmath5 , and the pressure @xmath6 .",
    "these governing equations together with three boundary conditions ( two kinematic boundary conditions on the free surface and the seabed , and one dynamic boundary condition on the free surface ) uniquely determine the five unknowns and the surface elevation @xmath7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we assume internal waves are small perturbations to a stable background state at equilibrium .",
    "therefore , density can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the background ( unperturbed ) density .",
    "similarly , we define a pressure perturbation @xmath10 via @xmath11 such that @xmath12 . with some standard manipulation , the governing equations can be written in terms of either of the five variables involved in this problem .",

    "for @xmath36 only one solution exists in the first quadrant ( with its mirrors in the other quadrants ) .",
    "this solution corresponds to a wave whose associated fluid particle motion is maximum near the free surface and decreases as the depth increases .",

    "therefore these branches show _ internal _ waves .",
    "the number of maxima in the amplitude of velocity along the vertical water line determines the mode number of the branch ( the first three are marked on the right - side of figure [ fig1 ] with arrows ) .",
    "a cut - off frequency @xmath32=1 sets an upper frequency limit for internal waves .",
    "it is to be noted that the dispersion relation , although has a different form , is in fact graphically very close to the one under rigid lid assumption @xmath38 .",

    "with the linear solution to and its properties at hand , we move to the second order equation by collecting @xmath39 terms obtained from the substitution of into .",
    "the second order equation has the exact same form as of the leading order equation on its left - hand side , but with nonlinear terms , arising from nonlinear functions @xmath17 , on its right - hand side .",
    "these nonlinear terms are multiplication of the linear solution ( and its derivatives ) and , it turns out that , they constitute forcing terms with wavenumber and frequency @xmath40 .",
    "now if @xmath41=0 , then it means that these forcing terms have a harmonic which is the same as the natural harmonic of the linear system .",
    "this is a resonance scenario through which a new second order solution may emerge and may grow large enough to the extent that it becomes comparable to the leading order solution ( beyond which the naive expansion is not valid anymore ) .",
    "we would like to note a subtle point here that at the second order the right - side of is identically zero ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore a potential harmonic - generation resonance is only possible through the nonlinear terms in the free surface boundary condition .",
    "if a rigid - lid assumption or a linearized form of the free surface boundary condition is employed ( which is usually the case in the investigation of internal waves ) the resonance harmonic generation will simply not obtain unless a non - uniform stratification or boussinesq terms are considered .    to see whether it is possible to satisfy the resonance condition required for the second harmonic of an internal wave to exist as a free propagating wave , we also plot in figure [ fig1 ] the contours of @xmath41=0 ( red dash - dotted curves ) for first four internal wave modes .",
    "intersections of these contours with the contours of @xmath42=0 ( solid blue curves ) identify waves whose second harmonics are also solution to the dispersion relation .",
    "some of these intersections are marked in figure [ fig1 ] by red circles and are identified by lowercase characters .",
    "it is easy to find the corresponding second harmonic by multiplying a designated ( red circle ) frequency and wavenumber by a factor of two , or alternatively by finding intersections of contours of @xmath43=0 ( green dashed curves ) and @xmath35 ( denoted by black squares and uppercase characters ) .",

    "it is to be noted that the second harmonic of an internal wave always belongs to a lower mode than the mode of the original wave .",
