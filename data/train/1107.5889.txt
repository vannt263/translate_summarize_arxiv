    "the in - medium properties of hadrons play an important role in understanding the strong interactions , the heavy ion collisions and the nuclear astrophysics .",
    "there have been many experiments devoted to study the in - medium hadron properties . the upcoming fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research )",
    "project at gsi provides the opportunity to extend the experimental studies into the charm sector .",
    "the cbm ( compressed baryonic matter ) collaboration intends to study the in - medium properties of the hadrons , including charmed mesons @xcite , while the @xmath11 collaboration will focus on the charm spectroscopy , and mass and width modifications of the charmed hadrons in the nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , the in - medium properties of the charmed mesons become excellent subjects in recent years",
    ".    the suppression of the @xmath12 production in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( such as rhic or lhc ) may be one of the important signatures to identify the possible phase transition to the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "although the dissociation of the @xmath12 in the quark - gluon plasma due to color screening reduces its production , the effects of hadron absorptions @xcite and co - mover interactions @xcite also play an important role , and one should be careful to make definitive conclusion .",
    "the in - medium modifications of the hadron properties can affect the productions of the open - charmed mesons and the @xmath12 in the heavy ion collisions , as the higher charmonium states are considered as the major source of the @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "if the mass reductions of the @xmath13 , @xmath14 mesons are large enough , the excited charmonium states can decay to the @xmath15 pair instead of decaying to the lowest state @xmath12 , the @xmath12 itself can also decay to the @xmath15 pair at even higher nuclear density @xcite , although the excited charmonium states undergo mass modifications in the nuclear matter .",
    "the @xmath13-meson can also be produced through the reaction @xmath16 in the heavy ion collisions , on the other hand , the @xmath13-mesons couple strongly through the inelastic channels such as @xmath17 @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the in - medium mass modifications of the @xmath19 mesons have been studied with the qcd sum rules @xcite , the quark - meson coupling model @xcite , the coupled - channel approach @xcite , etc .",
    "the works on the scalar @xmath0 , @xmath20 mesons are few @xcite , it is interesting to study their mass modifications in the nuclear matter to see whether or not the decaying of the higher excited charmonium states to the @xmath8 pair is facilitated .",
    "just like the @xmath13 meson , the @xmath0 meson contains a charm - quark and a light quark .",
    "the existence of a light quark in the charmed mesons results in much difference between the in - medium mass modifications of the charmed - mesons and charmonium states .",
    "the former have large contributions from the light - quark condensates , while the latter are dominated by the gluon condensates @xcite . in this article",
    ", we study the mass modifications of the @xmath21 mesons in the nuclear matter using the qcd sum rules @xcite , furthermore , we study the corresponding mass modifications of the @xmath22 mesons considering the heavy quark symmetry . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "hilger and kampfer study the in - medium mass modifications of the scalar @xmath21 mesons and quantify the @xmath23 mass splitting using the qcd sum rules , the hadronic spectral density they choose differs from that of the present work . in ref.@xcite , tolos et al study the in - medium properties of the scalar mesons @xmath0 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the coupled - channel approach and reproduce them as dynamically - generated resonances .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we study the in - medium mass modifications of the scalar mesons @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 with the qcd sum rules in sec.2 ; in sec.3 , we present the numerical results and discussions ; and sec.4 is reserved for our conclusions .",

    ", the @xmath26 can be divided into the vacuum part @xmath27 and the static one - nucleon part @xmath28 , which is expected to be valid at relatively low nuclear density , and the @xmath29 can be approximated in the linear density of the nuclear matter @xcite , @xmath30 where the @xmath31 denotes the density of the nuclear matter , and the forward scattering amplitude @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33 the @xmath34 denotes the isospin averaged current , @xmath35 the @xmath36 denotes the @xmath37 or @xmath38 quark , the @xmath39 is the four - momentum carried by the current @xmath34 , the @xmath40 denotes the isospin and spin averaged static nucleon state with the four - momentum @xmath41 , and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 can be neglected at the normal nuclear matter with the saturation density @xmath47 , as the fermi momentum @xmath48 is a small quantity @xcite .    in the limit @xmath49",
    ", the @xmath50 can be related to the @xmath2 scattering @xmath51-matrix , @xmath52 , where the @xmath53 is the @xmath2 scattering length . near the pole position of the @xmath0-meson",

    "then the mass - shift of the @xmath0-meson can be approximated as @xmath62    in the low energy limit @xmath63 , the @xmath64 is equivalent to the born term @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 .",
