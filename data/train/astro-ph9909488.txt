    "gs182624 was discovered serendipitously in 1988 by the _ ginga _ satellite ( makino et al . 1988 ) at an average flux of 26 mcrab ( 140 kev ) and was fitted by a single power law spectrum with @xmath6 . whilst showing some evidence for variability during 198889 ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ; int zand 1992 ) , _ rosat _ pspc observations in 1990 and 1992 ( barret et al . 1995 ) found comparable flux levels and no x - ray bursts were detected during 8 hours exposure on the source .",
    "the spectrum was well fitted by a single power law with @xmath7 and an absorption column , @xmath8 @xmath2 .",
    "temporal analysis of both the _ ginga _ and _ rosat _ data yielded a featureless @xmath9 power spectrum extending from @xmath10500 hz ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ; barret et al .",
    "1995 ) , with neither quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) nor pulsations being detected .",
    "since there was no detection prior to _ ginga _ , the source was catalogued as an x - ray transient .",
    "its similarities to cyg x1 and gx3394 in the low state , both in spectrum and temporal behaviour ( hard x - ray spectrum and strong flickering ) , led to an early suggestion by tanaka ( 1989 ) that it was a soft x - ray transient with a possible black - hole primary . following its detection by _ cgro",
    "_ osse in the 60200 kev energy range , strickman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) doubted the suggestion of a black - hole primary after examining the combined spectrum from both _",
    "ginga _ and osse .",
    "they found that this required a model with an exponentially cut - off power law plus reflection term .",
    "the observed cut - off energy around 58 kev is typical of the cooler neutron star hard x - ray spectra .",
    "the suggestion that gs182624 contains a neutron star was also discussed in detail by barret et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , where they compared the luminosity of the source with other x - ray bursters .",
    "the recent report of 70 x - ray bursts in 2.5 years by _ bepposax _ wfc ( ubertini et al . 1999 ) and an optical burst by homer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) confirms the presence of a neutron star accretor .",
    "following the first _",
    "pspc all - sky survey observations in september 1990 , and the determination of a preliminary x - ray position , a search for the counterpart yielded a time variable , uv - excess , emission line star ( motch et al .",
    "1994 ; barret et al .",
    "the source had @xmath11 , and an uncertain v magnitude ( @xmath12 ) , due to contamination by a nearby star .",
    "subsequent high - speed ccd photometry by homer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) yielded a @xmath5 2.1 hr optical modulation , but confirmation of its stability requires observation over a longer time interval .",
    "we therefore carried out an _ asca _ observation and simultaneous _ rxte_/optical observations of gs182624 in order to study its spectral behaviour and very short timescale variability , as well as the 2.1 hr optical modulation . in table 1 , we summarize the _ asca _ , _ rxte _ and saao observations used in this work .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "an outline of all the x - ray and optical observations is given in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we report the spectral analysis of _ asca _ data for both persistent and burst emission .",
    "rxte_/optical observations , including the analysis of a simultaneous x - ray / optical burst are also presented .",
    "we discuss the implications of the x - ray bursts and constrain the nature of the source from the delay between the x - rays and optical in section 4 .",
    "we present the overall timing study of the _ asca _ and _ rxte_/optical observations in a companion paper ( homer et al .",
    "1999 , henceforth paper ii ) .",
    ".a journal of the x - ray / optical observations of gs182624 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "x - ray and optical bursts from gs182624 were previously reported by ubertini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , int zand et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and homer et al .",
    "our x - ray / optical observations of gs182624 showed three x - ray bursts , of which two were observed by _",
    "asca _ , whereas one was observed by _",
    "rxte _ simultaneously with the optical . on the basis of their spectral properties and time profiles , all the bursts have a cooling trend during their decays and exhibit blackbody spectra with temperatures of a few kev .",
    "the time profiles show fast rise times of 79 s and long decay times ranging from 2060 s depending on the energy band .",
    "we therefore interpret the three bursts detected from gs182624 as type i bursts ( hoffmann et al .",
    "the relatively long rise time ( @xmath13 s ) , as compared to bursts in other systems , indicates that the burst front may have enough time to spread over the whole neutron star surface during the rise to burst and suggests that the burning is homogeneous over the surface of the neutron star .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that we see no evidence for pulsations during the burst .",
    "we note that x - ray burst rise times in other sources have been observed to be smaller than @xmath56 sec ( see e.g. sztajno et al .",
    "1986 ; lewin et al .",
    "1987 ) , making this system rather unique .",
    "the burst rise times derived by int zand et al .",
    "( 1999 ) range from 58 s which are also consistent with our observations .    for the simultaneous burst we may compare the ratio of the persistent to peak fluxes , in both the x - ray and optical , using the results of lawrence et al .",
    "they derived a simple power law relation between the changes in u , b and v band fluxes and the corresponding x - ray flux variations during a well - studied burst of x1636536 , with @xmath14 , where @xmath15 varies with passband .",
    "our burst shows that @xmath16 which is comparable to the value @xmath17 found for x1636536 in the @xmath18 band , which is the closest approximation to our white light passband .",
    "hence , we may imply that the reprocessed emission from the gs182624 burst is also approximately that from a blackbody ( with a temperature set by the degree of x - ray irradiation ) , where the optical passband is on the rayleigh - jeans tail ( lawrence et al .",
    "1983 ) .    the x - ray burst observed by rxte shows evidence for an increase in the burning area during the early rise phase , but no evidence for photospheric radius expansion . note that this is consistent with the fact that most x - ray bursts showing photospheric radius expansion have rise times less than @xmath51 sec ( see lewin et al .",
    "however , by assuming that our observed peak luminosity of @xmath19 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 is near the eddington limit of @xmath20 ergs s@xmath3 for a 1.4 m@xmath21 neutron star , we can set an upper limit to the distance to gs1826@xmath2224 .",
    "we derive a maximum distance of @xmath23 kpc .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the upper limit from _ bepposax _ nfi observations ( @xmath24 kpc ; int zand et al .",
    "1999 ) and the optical lower limit of 4 kpc ( barret et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the luminosity ratios are @xmath25 55 and @xmath5 50 for the bursts observed with _ asca _ and _ rxte _ , respectively .",
    "this is comparable with that found by _",
    "wfc ( @xmath26 ; ubertini et al . 1999 ) . coupling this value with an estimated stable accretion rate of @xmath27 m@xmath21 yr@xmath3 ( ubertini et al . 1999 ) , the burst must involve a combined hydrogen - helium burning phase ( lewin , van paradijs & taam 1995 ) .",
    "this relatively long burst also resembles the theoretical results of x - ray bursts driven by rapid proton capture process , or rp - process ( see hanawa & fujimoto 1984 ; taam 1981 ; bildsten 1998 ; schatz et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "pedersen et al . (",
    "1982 ) have shown that the optical burst mainly reflects the geometry of the system and that the contribution of intrinsic radiative processes is small .",
    "hence the correlated optical and x - ray bursts discussed above are useful as probes of the structure and geometry of the compact object surroundings . within the framework of the low - mass x - ray binary system",
    ", the reprocessing can occur in the accretion disk and the companion star . based on our",
    "observed mean delay of @xmath28 s for the optical burst with respect to low energy x - rays , we can then constrain the orbital period of the system . by kepler s law",
    ", the light travel time of 24 s corresponds to an orbital period of 1.65.5 hr if we assume a 1.4@xmath29 neutron star and a companion star mass of 0.11.1@xmath29 ( i.e. for a low - mass main sequence star and stable mass transfer ) .",
    "hence , this range of periods provides support for the @xmath30",
    "hr orbital period proposed by homer et al .",
    "lastly , from only one simultaneous optical / x - ray burst , we can not draw a firm conclusion as to whether the optical burst is due to reprocessing in the disk or on the surface of the companion star . however , given that the source is a low inclination system ( @xmath31 70@xmath32 ; homer et al .",
    "1998 ) and the ratio of smearing to delay is @xmath33 , the reprocessing is expected to be dominated by the accretion disk .",
    "it is important in future studies to search for the possibly variable delays if the reprocessing occurs on the surface of the companion star ( matsuoka et al .",
    "1984 ) or the ` thick spot ' in the disk proposed by pedersen et al .",
    "whether the dominant reprocessor is the companion star or the ` thick spot ' , one expects the ratio of optical to x - ray flux in a burst to vary periodically .",
    "moreover , the optical delay would vary as a function of orbital phase as suggested by pedersen , van paradijs & lewin ( 1981 ) .",
    "ubertini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) recently proposed a 5.76-hr quasi - periodicity in the occurrence of x - ray bursts in gs182624 , which makes this problem difficult to resolve with current low - earth - orbit satellites .",
    "however , with upcoming missions such as _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ , much longer continuous x - ray coverage will be possible , and together with ground - based telescopes will enable us to probe the structure of this source in much greater detail .",
    "we are grateful to darragh odonoghue ( saao ) for his advice on the the use of the uct - ccd for high - speed photometry and his help with the subsequent reductions .",
    "we also thank lars bildsten for valuable comments and fred marang ( saao ) for his support at the telescope , and the _ rxte _ soc team for their efforts in scheduling the simultaneous time .",
    "this paper also utilizes results provided by the asm/_rxte _ team .",
