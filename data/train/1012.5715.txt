    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) astrometry is an important method to measure the structure of the milky way galaxy ( mwg ) . by measuring the accurate position of the source and its time variation ,",
    "the source distance and proper motion can be determined directly .",
    "vlbi astrometry at 10 @xmath9as accuracy of the galactic h@xmath0o and ch@xmath10oh maser sources with the vlbi exploration radio astrometry ( vera ) and the very long baseline array ( vlba ) can determine accurate distances at kpc - scale with the errors less than 10% ( see for example @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the galactocentric distance of the sun , @xmath8 , and the galactic circular rotation velocity at the sun , @xmath7 , are two fundamental parameters to study the structure of the mwg and they are called here as the galactic constants .",
    "the rotation curve of the mwg and all kinematic distances of the sources in the mwg are derived from these parameters . since 1985 ,",
    "the international astronomical union ( iau ) has recommended to give the values of @xmath11 kpc and @xmath12 km s@xmath5 .",
    "however , recent studies report the values different from them ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "estimation of the galactic constants is , however , affected by several independent assumptions ; the peculiar motion of the source , systematic non - circular motions of both the source and the local standard of rest ( lsr ) due to the spiral arm potential , the non - axisymmetric potential of the mwg , the warping motion of the galactic disk , and , furthermore , the motion of the sun with respect to the lsr . in this paper",
    "to simplify the situation we assume that the source moves with the perfect circular rotation on the disk .",
    "the circle with the raduis of the galactocentric distance @xmath8 of the sun is called as the solar circle .",
    "all the sources on the circle perform the circular motion with the circular velocity @xmath7 of the lsr , provided that the non - circular motion of a source in the galactic disk is negligible .",
    "due to the symmetric geometry , the radial velocity of a source on the circle is observed to be zero with respect to the lsr , and the proper motion of the source depends only on the galactic rotation velocity @xmath7 of the lsr .",
    "therefore , we can derive @xmath7 from the measured proper motion of the source on the circle",
    ". we can also derive @xmath8 from the heliocentric distance of the source , since the source , the sun , and the galactic center make an isosceles triangle ( figure [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "thus , we can find directly the value of the angular velocity @xmath13 of the lsr from @xmath14 .",
    "traditionally , this value has been derived from the oort constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 on the basis of the kinematic analysis of stars in the solar neighbourhood ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the value of this ratio is a constraint to estimate one of the galactic constants from the other .",
    "although the iau gives recommended values of the galactic constants , at least one of them should be revised , if the ratio is inconsistent to the observed value .",
    "onsala 2 north ( on2n ) is a massive star - forming region located at the galactic coordinates of @xmath17 . its radial velocity @xmath18 with respect to the lsr",
    "is observed to be @xmath19 km s@xmath5 in the nh@xmath10 and cs lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite detected the h@xmath0o masers of on2n at the radial velocity range from @xmath20 to 9 km s@xmath5 , with their peak flux densities of @xmath21@xmath22 jy .",
    "these h@xmath0o masers are associated with a 7 mm radio continuum source and an nh@xmath10 core as well , which are located at approximately 2 \" south from the ultracompact h region , g75.78 + 0.34 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , on2n is considered to be one of the sources on the solar circle .",
    "we made astrometric observations of the h@xmath0o masers in on2n with vera .",
    "based on these proper motions and trigonometric parallax measurement , we estimate the galactic constants @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath13 .",
    "in this paper we use the `` lsr velocity '' or @xmath18 as the radial velocity with respect to the frame moving toward @xmath23 , @xmath24 with @xmath25 km s@xmath5 namely , a provisional solar motion with respect to the lsr to be determined after the traditional definition in radio astronomy since 1960s ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we observed h@xmath0o masers at the rest frequency of 22.235080 ghz in the star - forming region on2n with vera at 14 epochs spanned about two years .",
    "the day of year ( doy ) of these epochs are 112 , 206 , 246 , 305 , 350 in 2006 , 009 , 051 , 095 , 132 , 222 , 277 in 2007 , 005 , 104 , and 192 in 2008 , which are 53847 , 53941 , 53981 , 54040 , 54085 , 54109 , 54151 , 54195 , 54232 , 54322 , 54377 , 54470 , 54569 , and 54657 in the modified julian day ( mjd ) , respectively .",
    "the data of the first to third epochs were used to estimate the coodinates of h@xmath0o masers .",
    "we analyze the data of the rest 11 epochs in this study . at each epoch ,",
    "the h@xmath0o masers in on2n and a position reference continuum source , icrf j201528.7 + 371059 ( hereafter j2015 + 3710 ) , were simultaneously observed in a dual - beam mode for about 10 hours . the typical on - source integration time was 6 hours for both on2n and j2015 + 3710 .",
    "j2015 + 3710 is listed in the vlba calibrator survey 2 ( vcs2 : @xcite ) .",
    "j2015 + 3710 was detected with a peak flux density of 0.82 jy in each epochs .",
    "the separation angle between on2n and j2015 + 3710 is .",
    "the instrumental phase difference between the two beams was measured continuously during the observations by injecting artifical noise sources into both beams ( @xcite ) .",
    "left - hand circular polarization signals were sampled with 2-bit quantization , and filtered with the vera digital filter unit ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data were recorded onto magnetic tapes at a rate of 1024 mbps , providing a total bandwidth of 256 mhz , which consists of 16 if channels with a band width of 16 mhz each .",
    "one if channel was assigned to on2n , and the other 15 if channels were assigned to j2015 + 3710 , respectively .",
    "correlation processing was carried out on the mitaka fx correlator . the frequency and velocity spacings for on2n were 15.625 khz and 0.21 km s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "data reduction was conducted using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "an amplitude calibration was performed using the system noise temperatures during the observations . for phase - referencing",
    ", a fringe fitting was made using the aips task fring on j2015 + 3710 with a typical integration time of 1 min and a time interval of 30 sec .",
    "the solutions of the fringe phases , group delays , and delay rates were applied to on2n in order to calibrate the visibility data .",
    "phase and amplitude solutions obtained from self - calibration of j2015 + 3710 were also applied to on2n .",
    "visibility phase errors caused by the earth s atmosphere were calibrated based on gps measurements of the atmospheric zenith delay which occurs due to tropospheric water vapor ( @xcite ) .",
    "after the calibration , we made spectral - line image cubes each of which extent on the sky is @xmath26 pixels with 0.05 mas using the aips task imagr .",
    "the typical size of the synthesized beam was @xmath27 mas with position angle of .",
    "the rms noise for each image was approximately 0.11 jy beam@xmath5 .",
    "the signal - to - noize ratio of 7 was adopted as the detection criterion .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the scalar - averaged cross - power spectra of h@xmath0o masers in on2n observed with the vera mizusawa - iriki baseline on 2007/051 and 2008/104 .",
    "the intense emissions with the flux density of @xmath28 jy were detected at the lsr velocity range from @xmath29 to 5 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the center of the velocity range of the intense emissions is close to the lsr velocity of the associated molecular cloud at @xmath30 km s@xmath5 of the nh@xmath10 and cs lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of @xmath18 of h@xmath0o masers is found in the range @xmath31 km s@xmath5 seen in the previous monitoring observations in 19952004 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also detected the blueshifted components at @xmath32 and @xmath33 km s@xmath5 and the redshifted component at 19 km s@xmath5 , which were not detected in the preveous observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thirty h@xmath0o maser spots were detected over the half of year and at more than three epochs .",
    "they were in the lsr velocity range from @xmath34 to 19 km s@xmath5 , and distrubuted with an area of 1.0``@xmath350.4 '' .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the distribution of internal motion of the maser spots in on2n .",
    "the reference position of the map is set at the position of a maser spot at @xmath36 km s@xmath5 , which is estimated to be @xmath37 .",
    "although the h@xmath0o masers are located at 2 \" south from the peak of the 6 cm radio continuum emission ( @xcite ) , they are spatially coincident with the peaks of the 7 mm radio continuum emission and the nh@xmath10 ( 3,3 ) emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute motion of the respective h@xmath0o maser spot , i.e. its motion with respective to the position reference source j2015 + 3710 , is given by the sum of the proper motion and the annual parallactic motion . in order to separate these two motions we performed monitoring observations of the h@xmath0o masers of on2n for about two years .",
    "we made a combined parallax fit , which means a fitting of the positions of 30 h@xmath0o maser spots to a common parallax , but different proper motion and position offset for each spot .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] and table [ tab:1 ] show the results of the combined parallax fit . as can be clearly seen in figure [ fig:3 ]",
    ", the observed points demonstrate a sinusoidal modulation with a period of 1 year caused by the annual parallax . for this fitting",
    ", we assigned independent `` error floors '' in quadrature with the formal position fitting uncertainties .",
    "trial combined fits were conducted and a separate reduced @xmath38 ( per degree of freedom ) statistics was applied for the right ascension and declination residuals .",
    "the error floors of 0.088 mas and 0.111 mas in the right ascension and the declination respectively , were then adjusted iteratively so as to achive a reduced @xmath38 per dgree of freedom near unity in each coordinate . combining all of the fittings",
    ", we obtained the trigonometric parallax of the h@xmath0o maser spots @xmath39 mas .",
    "the parallax gives the heliocentric distance of on2n @xmath40 kpc .    in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] , we also show the estimated parallaxes using individual fitting for each maser spot .",
    "we made this individual fitting only for 14 maser spots which were detected over one year .",
    "the obtained parallaxes from the individual fitting are consistent with each other and with the result of the combined fit .",
    "this means that the parallax obtained by the combined fitting is reliable .",
    "the systemic motion of the source can be estimated as an averaged motion of all maser spots , provided that internal motion is random or symmetric .",
    "we believe that this may be reasonable for on2n because of the following two reasons .",
    "the averaged radial velocity of all maser spots is @xmath41 km s@xmath5 which is close to the systemic radial velocity derived from the associated molecular cloud .",
    "this suggests that the maser spots move rather symmetrically .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the residual proper motion vectors , which are differences between the individual proper motions and the average .",
    "we did not find any strong asymmetric motion .",
    "therefore , we find that the reasonable absolute proper motions are not biased by the internal motions of on2n .",
    "thus , the systemic proper motion of on2n is estimated to be @xmath42 mas yr@xmath5 as the average motion of all 30 maser spots .    using the galactic coordinates of on2n @xmath43 ,",
    "the proper motion components in the galactic coordinates are calculated to be @xmath44 mas yr@xmath5 corresponding to the linear velocity of @xmath45 km s@xmath5 at the distance of 3.83 kpc .",
    "we note that these values are still affected by the solar motion , because the observed proper motion is not relative to the lsr but to the sun .",
    "to convert this observed velocity to that with respect to the lsr , we have to fix the solar motion relative to the lsr .",
    "as mentioned in  1 we use the solar motion in the traditional definition of @xmath46 km s@xmath5 after @xcite .",
    "km s@xmath5 shown in @xcite is inconsistent to the definition by themselves .",
    "] we note that this set of values is very close to the one found by @xcite ( see table 5 ) on the basis of the stellar motion analysis of the hipparcos proper motions in the solar neighbourhood . using this traditional solar motion ,",
    "the observed proper motion is converted to @xmath47 mas yr@xmath5 and the corresponding linear velocity is @xmath48 km s@xmath5 relative to the lsr .",
