    "the interaction of high - intensity and ultra - short electromagnetic fields with condensed matter is an important subject from both fundamental and technological points of view @xcite . to investigate dynamics of electrons and phonons in real time ,",

    "one example of its use is creating coherent phonons and measuring their properties @xcite .",
    "the vibration is detected by measuring the change of reflectance of the probe pulse .",
    "however , this requires a good understanding of the dielectric properties of the surface excited by the pump pulse .",
    "another example is the energy deposited by strong laser pulses close to the damage threshold .",
    "they produce high - density electron - hole pairs at the surface of dielectrics , causing strong reflection for the probe pulse @xcite .",
    "it is even now possible to measure the population of high - density electron - hole pairs in the time resolution less than a femtosecond @xcite .",
    "however , the existing theory describing these effects is largely phenomenological .",
    "the dielectric properties of laser - excited material are often modeled with the drude model @xcite , assuming that excited electrons behave like free carriers .",
    "we have been developing a first - principles theoretical approach to describe electron dynamics in crystalline solids induced by the intense and ultrashort laser pulses .",
    "we rely upon the time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite , solving the time - dependent kohn - sham ( tdks ) equation in real time and real space @xcite .",
    "we have applied our approach to the optical breakdown @xcite , coherent phonon generation @xcite , high harmonic generation @xcite , and coupled dynamics of electrons and electromagnetic fields in a multiscale description @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we apply the tddft to dielectric properties of a medium excited by short , intense laser pulses .",
    "the method is to solve the tdks equation in the medium in the presence of an external electromagnetic field having both pump and probe pulses .",
    "thus , we simulate the pump - probe experiments numerically .",
    "the theory describes the electron dynamics fully quantum mechanically but assuming that the electrons only interact via a time - dependent mean field .",
    "thus , the theory is only expected to be justified before the times when electron - electron collisions have substantially affected the electronic structure .",
    "a separate issue is the creation of phonons . for the excitation energies we consider here",
    ", the electron - electron collision time sets a more stringent limit than the phonon interactions .    to interpret the results , we compare with several more simplified models .",
    "one model that is often used is based on a drude response of the excited quasiparticles , which embedded in a dielectric medium @xcite .",
    "this requires a number of parameters to be fitted .",
    "another model ignores the dynamics that created the excited electronic states , replacing it by a thermal ensemble of electrons @xcite .",
    "one can carry out the tddft calculation of the linear response of the thermal system and compare it directly with the response to the pump - excited system .",
    "we will find that many features of response can be understood even at a quantitative level with the simpler treatments .",

    "the relation of the vector potential @xmath5 in the unit cell to the external electromagnetic field exciting the system depends on a number of factors including possible macroscopic polarization fields . in the present analysis",
    ", we assume a transverse geometry as discussed in ref .",
    "the sample is treated as infinite in the direction of the polarization vector so there appears no polarization field inside the solid .",
    "of course the field is also affected by the absorption and the reflection from the surface region , but we do nt attempt here to express the results in terms of the incident laser intensity .",

    "this is seen by the phase difference between the current and the electric field , which is shifted by @xmath27 at the beginning of the field pulse ( @xmath28 fs ) .",
    "as the intensity of the pulse increases , the system absorbs energy by the excitation of electron - hole pairs . as a result ,",
    "the phase difference decreases .",
    "note that the current shows a weak oscillation at high frequency after the pulse has passed .",
    "making a fourier analysis , we find that it is dominated by frequencies around 3.9 ev/@xmath29 .",

    "as seen from the figure , both excitation energy and the number of excited electrons increase with increasing the applied field intensity . at low intensity region , they scale with the square of the field intensity .",
    "this is because two photons are required for electrons to be excited across the direct band gap . as seen from the bottom panel , the electronic excitation energy per excited electron - hole pairs",

    "as will be seen later , the dielectric property of excited matter also shows a large change from that in the ground state at field intensities above this value .      to extract dielectric properties of excited matter , we compare two calculations , one solving the tdks equation of eq .",

    "since there are no dissipative processes in the tddft under alda , the properties of the system should not change after some initial period when the phases of the excited orbitals become incoherent .",
    "figure [ delay ] shows how the extracted dielectric function depends on delay time for one of the cases .",
    "we have selected delay times over a range that corresponds to a full cycle of the pump pulse , since that frequency could be imprinted on the phases of the particle at later times .",
    "the range of the delay times is 19.00 fs , 19.67 fs , 20.33fs , and 21.67fs .",
    "the latter three delay times correspond to a quarter , a half , and one period of the pump pulse @xmath51 added to the first time .",

    "the difference comes from the nonequilibrium distributions of electrons and holes in @xmath17-space in the numerical pump - probe experiments .    in the embedded drude model",
    ", there are three parameters determining the quasiparticle plasmon contribution , namely the density of quasiparticles , their effective mass @xmath56 , and the collision time @xmath57 .",
    "the density of quasiparticles is known from the tddft or thermal calculation , but the other quantities are fit . from the real part of the dielectric function , we find increase of the effective mass as the pump field intensity increases as expected from the band structure .",
    "we find the calculated dielectric functions show substantial imaginary part . in the thermal electron model ,",
    "the collision time of as short as 1.2 fs gives reasonable fit .",
    "this short value for the collision time is unexpected , since there are no explicit collision terms in the time - dependent kohn - sham equation that we solve .",
    "we believe the short collision time comes from the elastic scattering of electrons from atoms rather than from electron - electron or electron - phonon interactions , but we lack a simple model to exhibit this aspect of the response .",

    "<S> we calculate the dielectric response of crystalline silicon following irradiation by a high - intensity laser pulse , modeling the dynamics by time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pump - probe measurements are numerically simulated by solving the time - dependent kohn - sham equation with the pump and probe fields included as external fields . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the excited silicon shows features of a particle - hole plasma in its response . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the calculated response with a thermal model and with a simple drude model . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal model requires only a static dft calculation to prepare electronically excited matter and agrees rather well with the tddft for the same particle - hole density . </S>",
    "<S> the drude model with two fitted parameters ( electron effective mass and collision time ) also shows fair agreement at the lower excitation energies ; the fitted effective masses are consistent with carrier - band dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted drude lifetimes range from 6 fs at weak pumping fields to much lower values at high fields . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the drude model does not give a good fit to the imaginary dielectric function at the highest fields . comparing the thermal model with the drude </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the extracted lifetimes are in the same range , 1 - 13 fs depending on the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these short drude lifetimes show that strong damping is possible in the tddft , despite the absence of electron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> one significant difference between the tddft response and the other models is that the response to the probe pulse depends on the polarization of the pump pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the imaginary part of the dielectric function can be negative , particularly for the parallel polarization of pump and probe fields . </S>"
