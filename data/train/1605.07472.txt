    "collisionless magnetic reconnection is a basic plasma process for the abrupt release of magnetic energy . understanding the process is crucial to discuss planetary magnetospheres , solar corona , the solar wind , laboratory plasmas , and astrophysical plasma environments .",
    "collisionless reconnection is a highly nonlinear , complex process , in which the electromagnetic field and the plasma particle motion interact with each other .",
    "the reconnection mechanism has not yet been fully understood , but numerical simulations provide a way to investigate the underlying physics .    since early research with particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations",
    ", it has been recognized that a small - scale electron - physics layer is embedded inside a broader ion - physics layer in collisionless magnetic reconnection .",
    "for example , @xcite presented a narrowly collimated electron jet inside a broader ion outflow .",
    "this picture was further extended by successive pic simulations , @xcite which were large enough to separate electron - scale structure from the ion - scale structure . @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the electron - physics layer evolves into the inner core region and the fast elongated jet .",
    "although these results raised a question concerning long - term behavior of magnetic reconnection,@xcite now many scientists agree that the inner core region controls the reconnection rate .",
    "the entire layer is often called the electron current layer ( ecl ) or the electron diffusion layer .",
    "hereafter we call it the electron current layer ( ecl ) .",
    "the inner core is called the dissipation region ( dr ) or the electron diffusion region ( edr ) .",
    "this is the site of dissipation physics , arising from complex electron motions ( see @xcite for a review ) . as of today ,",
    "the dr is ambiguously defined , and there are many different opinions on its rigorous definition.@xcite promising signatures to identify the dr are enhanced energy dissipation,@xcite electron nongyrotropic behavior,@xcite electron phase - space hole along the inflow direction,@xcite and characteristic velocity distribution functions ( vdfs).@xcite    the jet is popularly referred to as the super - alfvnic electron jet , because its bulk speed exceeds the alfvn speed in the inflow region .",
    "this fast jet has characteristic features such as violation of the electron ideal condition,@xcite diamagnetic - type momentum balance,@xcite an electron pressure anisotropy,@xcite electron nongyrotropy,@xcite bipolar polarization electric fields @xmath0 ( the so - called hall electric fields ) , and highly structured electron vdfs.@xcite these issues are usually discussed separately .",
    "the number of attempts to comprehensively explain these signatures has been limited .",
    "there have been many observational studies on the ecl during magnetic reconnection in the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "@xcite studied a magnetotail reconnection event with cluster spacecraft . with the help of a map of electron vdfs by pic simulation",
    ", they identified that the satellite crossed an electron - scale thin current layer near the x - line .",
    "@xcite reported an informative reconnection event in the magnetotail with the geotail spacecraft .",
    "they detected both bi - directional electron flows that outrun ion flows and an energy dissipation site around the x - line.@xcite @xcite studied another magnetotail reconnection event with ion - electron decoupling .",
    "they reported additional signatures in the ion - electron decoupling region , such as the energetic electron fluxes .",
    "@xcite reported a dr - crossing in the magnetotail with themis .",
    "they observed nongyrotropic electron vdfs and perpendicular heating inside the ecl .",
    "they also showed that the ecl is a site of electron energetization .",
    "in addition , there have been several observations of super - alfvnic electron jets inside the reconnection outflow exhaust in the magnetosheath,@xcite in the magnetotail,@xcite and in the solar wind.@xcite these results support the standard picture of the ecl , the central dr and extended electron jets .    in the above observations , time and spatial resolutions were rather limited to discuss electron physics in great detail . in order to probe electron - scale structures in near - earth reconnection sites at ultra - high resolutions ,",
    "nasa recently launched the magnetospheric multiscale ( mms ) spacecraft in 2015.@xcite mms is planned to move to the earth s magnetotail in 2017 , where magnetic reconnection often occurs in an anti - parallel configuration .",
    "it is expected that mms will encounter @xmath1 reconnection events.@xcite once it encounters reconnection events , mms is expected to resolve the aforementioned structures .    since spacecraft",
    "observe vdfs , it is important to understand the electron motion behind the vdfs in pic simulations .",
    "@xcite was one of the first to discuss electron vdf and associated particle motion .",
    "they examined vdfs near the magnetic island in the downstream region .",
    "@xcite found that electron vdfs are elongated in the field - aligned direction in the inflow region .",
    "as already introduced , @xcite studied spatial distribution of electron vdfs by pic simulation to interpret satellite data .    in order to prepare for the mms observation ,",
    "a growing number of works are devoted to electron vdfs in pic simulations .",
    "@xcite visualized the complex structure of the electron vdf in the dr .",
    "they reconstruct the vdf at high resolution , by back - tracing particle orbits in the pic field and by using a liouville s theorem .",
    "the vdf contains discrete striations in a triangular - shaped envelope .",
    "shuster et al.@xcite presented that electron vdfs contain various discrete components in the outflow exhaust .",
    "they further examined the structure of the electron vdf over the ecl , with help from test - particle simulations . @xcite examined electron vdfs in the ecl . in the dr , they gave semi - analytic expressions to the fine structure of the vdf .",
    "in the downstream , many arcs were found in the vdfs and they were attributed to a gradual remagnetization of electrons . @xcite inferred particle dynamics in driven reconnection from the spatial distribution of vdfs .",
    "they claimed that the field - aligned electron population in the inflow region is injected into the super - alfvnic electron jet .",
    "most recently , @xcite studied the electron heating mechanism in the exhaust region in detail .",
    "with help from test particle simulations , they found that parallel heating by the curvature drift acceleration and perpendicular heating by the gradient - b drift acceleration account for a highly structured vdf near the magnetic flux pile - up region .",
    "these vdfs are ensembles of electrons , following various complex trajectories in the reconnection system .",
    "in addition to a gyration and a parallel motion , several classes of electron particle motions are reported in the previous literature , such as a speiser motion around the dr@xcite and a field - aligned bounce motion in the inflow region.@xcite they are proven to be building blocks of the vdfs . however , it is not clear whether these particle motions and/or their combinations can explain everything about electron vdfs .",
    "in fact , as reviewed in this section , the ecl structure is found to be much more complicated than previously expected .",
    "it is possible that some electrons travel through new orbits near the reconnection site and that they have an impact on the reconnection dynamics and observational signatures . in order to better interpret the electron vdfs to deeper",
    "discuss kinetic reconnection physics , it is important to understand electrons particle orbits and dynamics in a modern reconnection simulation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to comprehensively discuss electron fluid properties , vdfs , self - consistent trajectories , and relevant particle dynamics around the ecl in magnetic reconnection .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we briefly review nongyrotropic particle motions in a curved magnetic field in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "next , we describe the numerical setup of a 2d pic simulation in section [ sec : setup ] . the simulation results are presented in several ways .",
    "section [ sec : fluid ] presents macroscopic fluid quantities . in section [ sec :",
    "kinetic ] , we present electron kinetic signatures such as vdfs and phase - space diagrams . in section",
    "[ sec : traj ] , we will discuss self - consistent electron trajectories in detail . in section [ sec : comp",
    "] , we utilize the trajectory datasets to further examine vdfs and spatial distribution of electrons .",
    "the relevance to the satellite observation is briefly addressed in section [ sec : et ] .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] contains discussions and summary .",
    "we outline basic properties of particle ( electron ) trajectories in a highly bent magnetic field.@xcite here we consider a simple parabolic field , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the reference magnetic field , @xmath4 is the length scale of the current sheet , and @xmath5 is the normal magnetic field .",
    "this system resembles the outflow region in magnetic reconnection at the lowest order .",
    "the equation of motion , @xmath6 , can be rewritten @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gyrofrequency about @xmath5 and @xmath9 is a characteristic frequency .",
    "the electron motion is characterized by the ratio of the two frequencies,@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the minimum curvature radius of magnetic field line and @xmath12 is the electron s maximum gyroradius .",
    "this parameter is known as the curvature parameter .",
    "the curvature radius solely depends on the field - line geometry , while the gyroradius @xmath13 depends on the electron velocity @xmath14 or the electron energy @xmath15 .",
    "note that both @xmath14 and @xmath16 are constant in this system , because @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath18 , the gyration about @xmath5 dominates .",
    "if the parameter falls below the unity , @xmath19 , the electron motion becomes nongyrotropic .",
    "in particular , the motion becomes highly chaotic for @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , because the two oscillations of different kinds interfere with each other .",
    "several characteristic orbits appear for @xmath22 , as will be shown in the next paragraphs .",
    "figure [ fig : theory ] demonstrates typical electron orbits for @xmath23 in the 3d space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : theory]a ) , the velocity space ( figs .",

    "the blue orbit demonstrates a well - known speiser orbit.@xcite after entering the midplane from the upper left , it slowly turns its direction from @xmath28 to @xmath29 due to the gyration about @xmath5 .",
    "then it exits in the @xmath29 direction . near the midplane ( @xmath30 )",
    ", the electron mainly travels in @xmath31 , while bouncing in @xmath25 at the frequency of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 in eq .",
    "this is the so - called meandering motion . in the velocity space",
    ", the @xmath5-gyration near the midplane corresponds to a half circle in @xmath34@xmath35 , as can be seen in figure [ fig : theory]c .",
    "the electron velocity rotates anti - clockwise from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the fast @xmath25-bounce motion is evident in @xmath38 , as indicated by the arrow in figure [ fig : theory]b .",
    "since the meandering motion consists of two opposite gyrations , the electron moves back - and - forth along arcs in @xmath38 .",
    "it finally exhibits a zigzag pattern in the 3d velocity space .",
    "the @xmath25-bounce motion also corresponds to the rotation around the center in the phase - space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : theory]d ) .",
    "the red orbit belongs to another kind of nongyrotropic orbit .",
    "it is called a regular orbit or an integrable orbit.@xcite when the @xmath25-motion fully resonates with the gyration about @xmath5 , the electron travels through a figure - eight - shaped orbit , hitting a fixed point at the midplane ( see also the left panel of fig .  4 in ref .  ) . in the vicinity of the figure - eight - shaped orbit ,",
    "electrons keep bouncing in @xmath25 and do not escape away from the midplane .",
    "it was further shown that the electrons are trapped on the surface of a ring - type torus , but the reader is referred to @xcite paper for detail . because of the @xmath25-bounce motion , we usually see closed circuits in the phase space ( fig .  [",

    "an electron jet as well as other electron - scale structures grows in time .",
    "they are well developed at the time of our interest , @xmath64 .",
    "we study this time step , because we studied other aspects in our previous studies,@xcite and because it is early enough to avoid major effects from the periodic boundary in @xmath55 .",

'' in the downstream of the remagnetization front , unmagnetized ions form a broad current layer.@xcite properties of this ion current layer was studied in our previous work.@xcite in figure [ fig : snapshot]b , it is interesting to see electron divergent flows in the vertical ( @xmath74 ) directions near the remagnetization front .",
    "the maximum jet speed is @xmath75 , also comparable with the inflow alfvn speed .",

    "the noncrossing speiser orbits can be further classified into noncrossing global speiser orbits and noncrossing local speiser orbits ( sec .  [ sec : noncrossing ] ) .",
    "as seen in vdfs in figure [ fig : vdf2 ] , the noncrossing electrons are confined in a low - energy part of the vdfs .",
    "they are the majority in number density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dist]a ) .",
    "one can order - estimate a typical energy of the noncrossing electrons ( @xmath308 ) in the following way : considering that the plasma density is nearly uniform over the reconnection site ( @xmath309 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot]f ) , we obtain @xmath310 from the pressure balance across the ecl .",
    "we find that ions sustain most of the perpendicular pressure .",
    "since the ion bounce motion sustains the polarization field , the electrostatic potential energy should be a small fraction ( @xmath311 ) of the ion energy , @xmath312 .",

    "this yields @xmath314 , in agreement with @xmath315 in figures [ fig : phase432]c , [ fig : phase432]f , and [ fig : vdf2]fa .    from the macroscopic viewpoint , the noncrossing electrons challenge the conventional understanding of ( 1 ) electron mixing and ( 2 ) electron heating during magnetic reconnection .",
    "first , as discussed in section [ sec : comp ] , the high - energy electrons from the two inflow regions mix with each other in the ecl . on the other hand , the noncrossing electrons do not enter the ecl due to the hall field @xmath0 .",
    "they start to mix with each other only downstream of the remagnetization front ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dist]b ) , where the hall field @xmath0 disappears ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot]c ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : snapshot]h , we recognize the enhanced energy dissipation around the dr , where the high - energy global speiser electrons start to mix with each other , and near the remagnetization front ( indicated by a circle ) , where the noncrossing electrons start to mix with each other .",
    "it is interesting to see that the nonideal energy transfer corresponds to these sites of electron mixing .",
    "the relevance between the dissipation measure @xmath316 and electron mixing deserves further research .",
    "second , the electron heating mechanisms have been actively studied in the last few years.@xcite these works reported electrons parallel heating outside the ecl inside the outflow exhaust .",
    "they implicitly assume the local - type speiser motion , while the relevant self - consistent orbits have not been investigated .",
    "in fact , @xcite showed in figure 2(d ) of their paper that the electron jet region , flanked by the bipolar @xmath81 layers , extends @xmath317 s away from the x - line .",
    "this is favorable for the noncrossing electrons .",
    "we expect that the noncrossing electrons are an integral part of the electron vdfs of the exhaust region .",
    "the electron heating mechanism should be investigated in more detail , by considering the noncrossing electrons .",
    "a question is whether these results are applicable to magnetic reconnection in the actual magnetotail , because we have employed artificial parameters in our pic simulation .",
    "the parameters include the mass ratio ( @xmath318 ) , the density ratio ( @xmath319 ) , the ratio of the plasma and gyro frequencies ( @xmath320 ) , and plasma beta ( @xmath321 ) in the inflow region .",
    "the mass ratio controls the relative size of the ecl within the reconnection site .",
    "however , as long as the ecl is well resolved , there is no reason to alter the electron physics .",
    "we expect that our results scale to the real mass ratio .",
    "since tenuous inflow plasma occupies the reconnection site , the density ratio ( @xmath319 ) should control only the build - up time of the ecl structure .",
    "the frequency ratio @xmath322 in the inflow region will be important , because it controls electrostatic properties around the ecl .",
    "@xcite we expect that the hall field @xmath323 will be important for @xmath324 . as we estimated in ref .  , the inflow frequency ratio in our pic simulation is @xmath325 in the tail lobe , we expect @xmath326@xmath327 for @xmath328 nt and @xmath329-@xmath330 .",
    "thus , our results will be applicable to the magnetotail reconnection .",
    "the plasma beta @xmath321 , in particular , the electron beta @xmath331 , may be another important factor . in the cold limit of @xmath332 , as in the magnetotail",
    ", we expect that fine structures will be more evident in electron vdfs.@xcite    the noncrossing electrons can be more pronounced in magnetic reconnection in different configurations .",
    "we address two favorable cases of driven - type reconnection and asymmetric reconnection . in the so - called driven systems ,",
    "inflow plasmas are continuously injected toward the reconnection site .",
    "in such a case , the ions inter - penetrate deeper than in the undriven case and therefore the polarization electric field becomes stronger .",
    "then we expect more noncrossing electrons on both sides of the midplane .",
    "in fact , @xcite presented an electron phase - space diagram across the x - line in a pic simulation of driven reconnection ( fig .",
    "5 in ref .  ) .",
    "the diagram shows clear signatures of noncrossing electrons , two high - density electron regions in red inside the ion meandering region .",
    "in asymmetric systems , there is often a density gradient across the two inflow regions .",
    "previous pic simulations@xcite reported a strong normal electric field on the low - density side of the boundary layer .",
    "this is a polarization field and this electric field layer overlaps the dr .",
    "in such a case , the low - density side of the dr is very favorable for noncrossing electrons . at the earth s magnetopause ,",
    "magnetic reconnection takes place between a high - density magnetosheath plasma and a tenuous magnetospheric plasma , continuously driven by the solar wind .",
    "we expect that noncrossing electrons will be a key player for understanding the physics of magnetopause reconnection .",
    "since the sunward polarization electric field will be enhanced , magnetospheric electrons will rarely mix with magnetospheric plasma in the exhaust region .",
    "in addition , the reconnection system may involve an out - of - plane magnetic field ( the so - called guide - field ) .",
    "in fact , reconnection events with a guide - field have been observed even in the earth s",
    "magnetotail,@xcite where we expect antiparallel magnetic fields .",
    "since a small guide - field alters the ecl structure,@xcite the noncrossing electron orbits will be modified accordingly .",
    "a guide - field tends to magnetize electrons even in the dr , while the polarization electric field persists in the guide - field case .",
    "electron orbits in guide - field reconnection deserve independent research .",
    "we have also ignored the variation in the @xmath121 direction . at this point , it is not clear whether our picture persists in 3d configurations or not .",
    "nevertheless , it is encouraging that the satellite observation is consistent with the simulation with noncrossing electrons ( sec .",
    "[ sec : et ] ) .    in this work , we have investigated particle dynamics in the electron current layer ( ecl ) in collisionless magnetic reconnection in an antiparallel magnetic field . by tracking self - consistent trajectories in the two - dimensional pic simulation , we have found new classes of electron orbits .",
    "the electron motion in and around the ecl is much more complicated than we have expected before .",
    "the new orbits , as well as previously known orbits , are schematically illustrated in figure [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "in the inflow region , electrons are gyrating and fast - bouncing in the parallel direction , as extensively studied by @xcite .",
    "near the separatrices , some electrons stream along the field lines toward the x - line . once electrons enter the dr , they undergo the speiser motions of global type.@xcite the electrons slowly turn around to the outflow directions while bouncing in @xmath25 .",
    "others travel through the speiser motions of local - reflection type . inside the ecl",
    ", there exists an figure - eight - shaped ( crossing ) regular orbit.@xcite the polarization electric field introduces noncrossing regular orbits on the jet flank and noncrossing speiser orbits .",
    "similar to the traditional speiser orbits , the noncrossing speiser orbits can be categorized as the global type and the local reflection type , although their difference is ambiguous .",
    "downstream of the remagnetization front , some speiser electrons remain around the center as nongyrotropic electrons , while others travel near the separatrices in field - aligned electron outflows .    considering particle orbits ,",
    "we have discussed key properties of the electron jet .",
    "the electrons are traveling through speiser orbits .",
    "the fast bulk speed , electron nonidealness , anisotropy , and nongyrotropy are consequences of the electron nongyrotropic motion in the @xmath19 regime .",
    "the noncrossing orbits are consistent with the electron density profile , the energy - dependent spatial distribution of electrons , and the electron mixing sites with nonideal energy transfer .",
    "they correspond to the following observational signatures of the ecl : ( 1 ) the super - alfvnic electron jet will be populated by high - energy nongyrotropic electrons .",
    "( 2 ) the electron density is lower than in the jet flank region .",
    "( 3 ) the electron energy - time diagram will exhibit the two - step profile .",
    "we hope these predictions will be confirmed by the mms spacecraft@xcite in the second science phase targeting the magnetotail .",
