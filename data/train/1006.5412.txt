    "observations on large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite and cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite@xmath1@xcite indicate that the universe is highly homogeneous and isotropic on large scales . under standard assumptions on the matter",
    "content , in general relativistic cosmological models , isotropy is a special feature , requiring a high degree of fine tuning in order to reproduce the observed universe .",
    "recent years have witnessed the emergence of the idea of an accelerating universe due to some observational results @xcite@xmath1@xcite .",
    "this signifies a remarkable shift in cosmological research from expanding universe to accelerated expanding universe .",
    "now , the problem lies in detecting an exotic type of unknown repulsive force , termed as dark energy  ( de ) which is responsible for the accelerating phase of the universe .",
    "the detection of de would be a new clue to an old puzzle : the gravitational effect of the zero - point energies of particles and fields @xcite .",
    "the total with other energies , that are close to homogeneous and nearly independent of time , acts as de .",
    "the paramount characteristic of the de is a constant or slightly changing energy density as the universe expands , but we do not know the nature of de very well ( see @xcite@xmath1@xcite for reviews on de ) .",
    "de has been conventionally characterized by the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath2 which is not necessarily constant .",
    "the simplest de candidate is the vacuum energy @xmath3 , which is argued to be equivalent to the cosmological constant @xmath4 @xcite",
    ". the other conventional alternatives , which can be described by minimally coupled scalar fields , are quintessence @xmath5 , phantom energy @xmath6 and quintom ( that can across from phantom region to quintessence region ) as evolved and have time dependent eos parameter .",
    "some other limits obtained from observational results coming from sn ia data @xcite and sn ia data collaborated with cmbr anisotropy and galaxy clustering statistics @xcite are @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "however , it is not at all obligatory to use a constant value of @xmath0 . due to lack of observational evidence in making a distinction between constant and variable @xmath0 , usually the equation of state parameter",
    "is considered as a constant @xcite with phase wise value @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 for vacuum fluid , dust fluid , radiation and stiff fluid dominated universe , respectively .",
    "but in general , @xmath0 is a function of time or redshift @xcite@xmath1@xcite .",
    "for instance , quintessence models involving scalar fields give rise to time dependent eos parameter @xmath0 @xcite@xmath1@xcite .",
    "also some literature is available on models with varying fields , such as cosmological model with variable equation of state parameter in kaluza - klein metric and wormholes @xcite . in recent years",
    "various form of time dependent @xmath0 have been used for variable @xmath13 models @xcite .",
    "recently ray et al @xcite , akarsu and kilinc @xcite have studied variable eos parameter for generalized dark energy model .",
    "bianchi type - v universe is generalization of the open universe in frw cosmology and hence its study is important in the study of de models in a universe with non - zero curvature @xcite . a number of authors such as collins @xcite , maartens and nel @xcite , wrainwright et al @xcite , canci et al @xcite , pradhan et al @xcite and yadav @xcite have studied bianchi type - v model in different physical contexts . recently yadav and yadav @xcite have studied anisotropic de models with variable eos parameter . in this paper , we have investigated the de models with variable @xmath0 in bianchi type - v universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the metric and field equation are presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we deal with the solution of field equations and discussion .",
    "finally the result are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we consider lrs bianchi type v metric in the form @xmath14 where a and b are the function of t only .",
    "+ the simplest generalisation of eos parameter of perfect fluid may be to determine the eos parameter separately on each spatial axis by preserving the diagonal form of the energy - momentum tensor in a consistent way with the considered metric .",
    "thus , the energy momentum tensor of fluid is taken as @xmath15\\ ] ] then , one may parametrize it as follows , @xmath16 = diag\\left[1 , -\\omega_{x } , -\\omega_{y } , -\\omega_{z}\\right]\\rho\\ ] ] @xmath17\\rho\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the energy density of fluid , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the pressures and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the directional eos parameters along the x , y and z axes respectively .",
    "@xmath0 is the derivation - free eos parameter of the fluid .",
    "we have parametrized the deviation from isotropy by setting @xmath25 and then introducing skewness parameter @xmath26 that are deviation from @xmath0 along y and z axis respectively .",
    "+ the einstein field equations , in gravitational units ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , are @xmath29 where the symbols have their usual meaning . + the einstein s field equation ( [ eq4 ] ) for the bianchi type v space - time ( [ eq1 ] ) , in case of ( [ eq3 ] ) , lead to the following system of equations @xmath30",
    "@xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 here , the sub indices 4 in a , b , and elsewhere denote differentiation with respect to t. + integrating equation ( [ eq8 ] ) , we obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the positive constant of integration .",
    "we substitute the value of equation ( [ eq9 ] ) in equation ( [ eq7 ] ) and subtract the result from equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , we obtain that the skewness parameter on z - axis is null i.e. @xmath36 thus system of equations from ( [ eq5 ] ) - ( [ eq8 ] ) may be reduce to @xmath37 @xmath38 now we have three linearly independent equations ( [ eq9 ] ) - ( [ eq11 ] ) and four unknown parameters @xmath39 .",
    "thus one extra condition is needed to solve the system completely . to do that",
    ", we have used the law of variation of hubble s parameter that yields a constant value of deceleration parameter .",
    "+ the average scale factor of bianchi type v metric is given by @xmath40 we define , the generalised mean hubble s parameter @xmath41 as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the directional hubble s parameter in the direction of x , y and z respectively . + equation ( 13 ) , may be reduces to @xmath45 here the line - element ( [ eq1 ] ) is completely characterized by hubble s parameter h. therefore , let us consider that mean hubble parameter h is related to average scale factor @xmath46 by following relation @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are constant . such type of relation have already been considered by berman @xcite for solving frw models .",
    "later on many authors ( singh et al @xcite and references therein ) have studied flat frw and bianchi type models by using the special law of hubble parameter that yields constant value of deceleration parameter .",
    "+ the deceleration parameter is defined as @xmath50 from equations ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( 15 ) , we get @xmath51 @xmath52 using equations ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) , equation ( [ eq16 ] ) leads to @xmath53 the sign of @xmath54 indicates whether the model inflates or not .",
    "the positive sign of @xmath54 corresponds to standard decelerating model where as the negative sign of @xmath54 indicates inflation .",
    "it is remarkable to mention here that though the current observations of sn ia ( permutter et al 1999 , riess et al 1998 ) and cmbr favour accelerating models i.e. @xmath55 . but both do not altogether rule out the decelerating ones which are also consistent with these observations ( vishwakarma 2003 ) . + from equation ( [ eq17 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the law of average scale factor r as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the constant of integration .",
    "+ from equation ( [ eq20 ] ) , for @xmath59 , it is clear that the condition for accelerating expansion of universe is @xmath60 .",
    "equations ( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) lead to @xmath62 from equations ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath63    where l is the constant of integration and @xmath64 . +",
    "thus the hubble s parameter @xmath65 , scalar of expansion @xmath66 , shear scalar @xmath67 and spatial volume @xmath68 are given by @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 using equations ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq20 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) , the energy density of the fluid is obtained as @xmath73 using equations ( [ eq11 ] ) , ( [ eq21 ] ) , ( [ eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq27 ] ) , the equation of state parameter @xmath0 is obtained as @xmath74 } { 3\\left[1-\\frac{n^2}{l^2d^2}\\left(dt+c_{1}\\right)^\\frac{2(n-1)}{n}\\right]}\\ ] ]        from equation ( [ eq27 ] ) , we note that @xmath75 is the decreasing function of time .",
    "this behaviour is clearly shown in fig .",
    "2 , as a representative case with appropriate choice of constants of integration and other physical parameters using reasonably well known situations . from equation ( [ eq28 ] )",
    ", it is observed that the equation of state parameter @xmath0 is time dependent , it can be function of redshift z or scale factor r as well",
    ". the redshift dependence of @xmath0 can be linear like @xmath76 with @xmath77 @xcite or nonlinear as @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the sn ia data suggests that @xmath7 @xcite while the limit imposed on @xmath0 by a combination of sn ia data ( with cmb anisotropy ) and galaxy clustering statistics is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "so , if the present work is compared with experimental results mentioned above then , one can conclude that the limit of @xmath0 provided by equation ( [ eq28 ] ) may accommodated with the acceptable range of eos parameter .",
    "the value @xmath79 is the case of vacuum fluid dominated universe . but here , we are dealing with the solution for @xmath61 , therefore in this case , vacuum fluid dominated universe is meaningless .",
    "also we see that during evolution of universe , at an instant of time @xmath80^\\frac{n}{2n-2}-c_{1}\\right)$ ] , the @xmath0 vanishes .",

    "in this paper , we have studied dark energy model with variable eos parameter @xmath0 . the model is derived by using law of variation of hubble s parameter that yields a constant value of deceleration parameter .",

    "@xmath0 is found to be time varying and negative which is consistent with recent observations @xcite . in case ( i )",
    ", we have shown that , @xmath0 is evolving from @xmath103 and finally end up with @xmath104 , representing two phases of universe i.e. @xmath105 ( phantom fluid dominated universe ) and @xmath106 ( quintessence),[fig . 3 and fig . 4 ] .",
    "where as in case ( ii ) , for @xmath88 , from equation ( [ eq38 ] ) , we have obtained that , at cosmic time @xmath107 , @xmath108 and when @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that at early stage , universe was dominated by phantom fluid and at late time it will be vacuum fluid dominated universe [ fig .",
    "also it is seen that that in both cases , @xmath111 , therefore the proposed models do not approach to isotropy at any time .",

    "+ the main fetures of the models are as follows +   though there are many candidates such as cosmological constant , vacuum energy , space - time curvature , cosmological nuclear energy , etc as reported in the vast literature for de , the proposed models in this paper at least present a new candidate ( eos parameter ) as possible suspect of the dark energy .",
    "+   the dark energy models are based on exact solution of einstien s field equations for the bianchi type v space - time filled with perfect fluid . to our knowledge ,",
    "the literature hardly witnessed this sort of exact solution for bianchi type v space - time .",
    "so the derived de models add one more feather to the literature .",
    "the de models presents the dynamics of eos parameter @xmath0 provided by equations ( [ eq28 ] ) and ( [ eq38 ] ) may accommodated with the acceptable range @xmath7 of sn ia data ( knop et al 2003 ) .",
