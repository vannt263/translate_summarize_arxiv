    "after the static properties as masses , widths and magnetic moment , a good comprehension of the form factors in the ground state as well as in the excited state , is required . in the field of nucleon resonances , in particular , the nature of the nucleonic resonance @xmath2 , the _ roper resonance _",
    ", with isotopic spin @xmath3 and usual spin @xmath3 ( excited nucleon ) is still not well known .",
    "this resonance was discovered during the phase shift analysis of data on @xmath4-scattering @xcite , it is predicted by most of the quark models , but never directly observed .    the measurement of transition nucleon form factors is mostly based on studies with electromagnetic probes where one measures the different polarization observables for meson electroproduction processes .",
    "however , due to the isospin nonconservation in the electromagnetic interaction , a photon does not have a definite value of isospin .",
    "therefore it is not possible to separate the isoscalar and isovector contributions , using only data about inclusive @xmath5and @xmath6collisions , but , due to the isoscalar selectivity of the deuteron probe ( in the framework of a @xmath7channel @xmath8exchange approximation for the process @xmath9 ) , it is possible to determine the isoscalar amplitude separately . in this respect hadronic processes",
    "may be considered as the necessary and complementary tools to study the isotopic structure of @xmath10interactions .",
    "the study of @xmath11structure by hadronic probe has known advantages with respect to real or virtual photons : large values of cross sections , advanced technics of high intensity @xmath12 and @xmath13 beams , polarized targets and polarimeters , absence of problem of radiative corrections , natural selection of isoscalar @xmath14-excitation , if one chooses isoscalar particles , as @xmath15 or @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the reaction mechanism is not well known @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath8exchange seems to be the best mechanism to describe the @xmath14-excitation in @xmath18 or @xmath19collisions : the @xmath20 coupling constant is large , a spin one exchange allows to obtain very specific polarization phenomena and energy - independent cross section . in the framework of this mechanism , it is possible to predict all observables for the reaction @xmath21 in terms of deuteron electromagnetic form factors and isoscalar form factors of @xmath22 transitions @xcite .    in this contribution we will recall the properties of the @xmath21 and @xmath23 reactions in the framework of @xmath8 ( @xmath24- ) exchange and derive the relevant polarization observables",
    "the differential cross section has been measured in the past at incident energy @xmath26=1.6 gev @xcite and more recently at @xmath26=2.3 gev , at the saturne accelerator @xcite .",
    "polarization observables have been measured at saturne @xcite and dubna @xcite .",
    "the existing data on the differential cross section for this reaction show the presence of at least two mechanisms in the intermediate energy region ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "one is the coherent excitation of @xmath15 with pion production ( fig .",
    "1a ) , which results in a deck peak @xcite , in the energy spectrum of the scattered deuterons .",
    "the isotopic spin of this peak is @xmath28 , but the spin @xmath29 and the space parity @xmath30 of the deck peak may not have a unique value .",
    "the deck effect decreases when the energy of the colliding particles increases , while the role of a second mechanism , the direct @xmath11 excitation , must become more important .",
    "this can be described by a @xmath7channel exchange by mesonic states ( fig .",
    "2b ) , with @xmath31 and with different @xmath32 : @xmath33 .    the tensor analyzing powers , which are strongly negative ,",
    "show a large similarity with the tensor polarization data measured in @xmath34 elastic scattering @xcite , therefore suggesting the @xmath8meson being the most probable mediator .",
    "an extended version of a model based on @xmath7channel @xmath35-exchange has been published in @xcite .",
    "let us recall here two main results : the linearity of the cross section as a function of a kinematical variable @xmath36 , defined below , and a factorization of the tensor analyzing power in a function of the deuteron and the @xmath14 electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the differential cross section , corresponding to diagram @xmath37 ( with @xmath35-exchange ) , can be written in the following form : @xmath38,\\ ] ] where : @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the invariant effective mass of @xmath41 , in the process @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is the proton ( deuteron ) mass .",
    "the notation of four - momenta is illustrated in fig .",
    "the linear @xmath45dependence of the differential cross section is a direct consequence of the spin one @xmath8exchange in the @xmath7channel . in a general case",
    "the inclusive scattering process @xmath46 is characterized by 3 independent variables : @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the dependence of the cross section from @xmath50 and @xmath51 has a dynamical character and is described by the corresponding sf s for the @xmath52 and @xmath53 vertexes .",
    "the linearity of the dependence ( 1 ) of the double differential cross section on @xmath54 can be experimentally tested by a measurement of the differential cross section , at three different energies of the initial deuteron ( 3 different values of @xmath48 ) , at fixed values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this linearity is a direct consequence of the @xmath8exchange mechanism , and such measurement would be an experimental test of the validity of the @xmath8exchange mechanism , equivalent to the rosenbluth fit for electron - hadron scattering .",
    "one can mention that the rosenbluth fit allows also to separate the contributions of longitudinal and transversal photon polarizations to the differential cross section of any process @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , the study of the @xmath45linearity of the double differential cross section for processes @xmath21 will allow to separate two different structure functions . at the limit @xmath56",
    ", we have : @xmath57 i.e. the differential cross section becomes @xmath48-independent , as it is expected for a @xmath7channel exchange of a spin - one meson . in case of @xmath58 or",
    "@xmath59exchange the cross section has to decrease with @xmath48 according to : @xmath60 these different properties should help to sign experimentally the @xmath8exchange contribution .",
    "the predictions for this observable , in case of @xmath8 , @xmath58 or @xmath59exchange are very different and are given below .",
    "the @xmath61-vertex can be described , in the general case , in terms of two independent form factors with the following spin structures : @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the unit vector along the three - momentum transfer , @xmath65 is the vector of polarization of the initial ( final ) deuteron and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are form factors related to the deuteron form factors .",
    "the tensor analyzing power is : @xmath68 it is possible to induce tensor analyzing power even in the case of @xmath59exchange ( spin 0 particle ) , only if one takes into account high order effects ( interaction with derivatives ) which are characterized by @xmath69 .    in this case",
    "the @xmath70-vertex is characterized by a single spin structure , @xmath71 , and using the @xmath72-vertex in the form : @xmath73 , one can find @xmath74 , positive and @xmath7independent .",
    "the form factor @xmath75 of the @xmath76vertex is proportional to the magnetic form factor of the deuteron ( in the impulse approximation ) .",
    "the tensor analyzing power in @xmath21 , @xmath77 , can be written in terms of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are linear combinations of the standard electric , @xmath82 , magnetic @xmath83 and quadrupole @xmath84 deuteron form factors .",
    "the ratio @xmath85 characterizes the relative role of longitudinal and transversal isoscalar excitations in the transition @xmath86 .",
    "it can be written , for the excitation of any nucleon resonance @xmath14 , as follows : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the longitudinal form factor , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the two possible transversal form factors , corresponding to total @xmath91-helicity equal to @xmath3 and @xmath92 , for proton and neutron .",
    "the excitation of overlapping resonances with finite values of widths , introduces a @xmath40-dependence in @xmath85 as follows : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a breit - wigner function for the @xmath95-resonance with a definite normalization : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the pion mass .",
    "the interference due to the excitation of different resonances does not appear in the inclusive processes .",
    "it is contained in the angular distribution of the decay products ( for example @xmath98-production ) , on which an integration is implicitely performed in the previous formulas .    from eq .",
    "( 5 ) one can see that all information about the @xmath99-vertex is contained in the function @xmath85 only . a zero value of @xmath85 results in a @xmath7 and @xmath40-independent value for @xmath77 , namely @xmath100 , for any value of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the ratio @xmath85 is calculated using the collective string model in @xcite , assuming @xmath101 symmetry , including the contributions of the following resonances : @xmath102 , which are overlapping in this energy region .",
    "of these four resonances only the roper resonance has a nonzero isoscalar longitudinal electromagnetic form factor .",
    "the longitudinal amplitudes of @xmath103 and @xmath104 excitations vanish because of spin - flavor symmetry , while both isoscalar and isovector longitudinal couplings of @xmath105 and @xmath106 excitations vanish identically .    in fig .",
    "2 we report the theoretical predictions for @xmath77 , using eqs .",
    "( 5 - 6 ) , together with the existing experimental data . in such approximation",
    "@xmath77 is a universal function of @xmath50 only , without any dependence on the initial deuteron momentum .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath77 for @xmath107 @xcite , for different momenta of the incident beam are shown as open symbols .",
    "these data show a scaling as a function of @xmath50 , with a small dependence on the incident momentum , in the interval 3.7 - 9 gev / c . on the same plot",
    "the data for the elastic scattering process @xmath108 @xcite are shown ( filled stars ) .",
    "these different data show a very similar behavior : negative values , with a minimum in the region @xmath109 and their value increase toward zero at larger @xmath110 .",
    "the lines are the result of the @xmath35-exchange model for the @xmath21 process : for @xmath111 ( dashed - dotted line ) , the calculation based on @xcite for the roper excitation only is represented by the dotted line and for the excitation of all the four resonances by the the full line .",
    "the deuteron electromagnetic form factors have been taken from @xcite , a calculation based on relativistic impulse approximation , and they reproduce well the @xmath112data for @xmath34 elastic scattering @xcite . when @xmath113 or",
    "if the contribution of the deuteron magnetic form factor @xmath80 is neglected , then @xmath77 does not depend on the ratio @xmath85 , and coincides with @xmath114 for the elastic @xmath34-scattering ( with the same approximation ) .    from fig .",
    "2 it appears that the @xmath7behavior of @xmath77 is very sensitive to the value of @xmath85 especially at relatively small @xmath85 , @xmath115 .",
    "the values of @xmath85 , predicted by model @xcite , give a very good description of the data , when taking into account the contribution of all four resonances .",
    "these data , in any case , exclude a very small value of @xmath116 as well as very large values of @xmath85 .",
    "such sensitivity of @xmath77 for @xmath21 to the ratio of the corresponding isoscalar form factors of the @xmath14-excitation gives an evident indication of the excitation of the roper resonance in this process .",
    "the predicted dependence of the ratio @xmath117 and of @xmath77 , on the initial deuteron momentum is not so large , in agreement with experimental data .",
    "this model for @xmath21 may be improved , taking into account for example , other meson exchanges , or the effects of the strong interaction in initial and final states .",
    "however the corrections that can be added to the model presented here are strongly model and parameter dependent , and are not justified by the existing experimental data .",
    "let us note in this connection , that , in the considered model , all t - even polarization observables are nonzero and large in absolute value .",
    "this is an intrinsic property of @xmath35-exchange . but all t - odd polarization effects cancel , because we neglected the strong interaction in initial and final states . in case of collinear kinematics , all one spin t - odd polarization observables vanish , in any model .",
    "the most simple t - odd polarization observable , which exists in the general case for the collinear kinematics , corresponds to the following correlation coefficient : @xmath118 , @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the proton polarization and @xmath121 is the deuteron tensor polarization .",
    "a measurement of these observables will give a direct information on the presence and intensity of the final or initial strong interaction .",
    "the tensor analyzing power @xmath77 , being a t - even observable , is less sensitive to such effects .",
    "let us calculate the ( vector ) transfer polarization coefficients @xmath123 ( with @xmath124 , @xmath125 or @xmath126 ) from initial to final deuterons , in the processes @xmath122 , in the framework of @xmath8 exchange . using the corresponding parametrization of the @xmath127vertex",
    ", one can find the following formulas , for the nonzero polarization transfer coefficients : @xmath128 for @xmath111 we obtain simply : @xmath129 : all coefficients are positive and @xmath7independent .",

    "( 3 ) , one can see that @xmath132 has a strong @xmath133 and @xmath85 dependence .",
    "the point where all lines for different @xmath85 are crossing is due ( as for @xmath77 ) to a special combination of @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( see the numerator of eq . ( 6 ) ) .",
    "at @xmath136 , @xmath137 , for any value of @xmath85 , as @xmath138 .",
    "the largest sensitivity to @xmath85 is in the region @xmath139 and the position of zero crossing is strongly @xmath140dependent .",
    "the polarization properties of the produced protons in the processes @xmath142 or @xmath143 depend essentially on the kind of the produced meson and on the quantum numbers ( @xmath144 ) of the nucleonic resonance in the intermediate state : @xmath145 .",

    "<S> the purpose of this contribution is to stress the great importance of polarization observables for the study of nucleon resonances , in particular in the case of deuteron and proton probes . </S>",
    "<S> polarization observables play a unique role in signing the reaction mechanism and bring new information in the microscopic description of baryon resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we will calculate the relevant polarization observables , for @xmath0- and @xmath1-collisions , in case of inclusive reactions and for some selected exclusive channels . </S>"
