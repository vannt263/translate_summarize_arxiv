    "their properties differ significantly from those of the bare uncoupled excitations , though they originate from them .",
    "the lower polariton ( lp ) has a peculiar dispersion law with a deep minimum at small wavevectors , characterized by a tiny mass . at high densities ,",
    "the build - up of a large population at the bottom of this branch is favoured by bosonic final - state stimulation as soon as the occupation per mode of the lower polariton states exceeds unity .",
    "coherent light - emission , called polariton lasing , results from this macroscopic population due to the finite lifetime of the polaritons which leak out of the cavity via their photonic component .",
    "this is only one of the many outstanding phenomena  @xcite that have attracted more and more attention to the field of polaritonics in inorganic semiconductor microcavities since the pioneering observation of the strong coupling regime .",
    "@xcite    the weak binding energy and oscillator strength of wannier - mott excitons characteristic of inorganic semiconductors are limitations that can be overcome employing organic semiconductors having strongly bound frenkel excitons with a large oscillator strength .",
    "@xcite the strong coupling regime in an organic based microcavity was first observed at room temperature using a porphirine molecule ( 4tbppzn ) dispersed in a polysterene film as optically resonant material at room temperature ,  @xcite and later in a variety of organic materials  @xcite including polyacene molecular crystals .",
    "@xcite the latter are also characterized by the presence of well developed vibronic replicas that participate in polariton formation and affect their luminescence .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the case of inorganic microcavities , manifestations of bosonic stimulation using organic cavity polaritons have been quite elusive .",
    "recently , however , several non - linear phenomena were reported : room temperature polariton lasing in an anthracene single crystal microcavity ,  @xcite indirect pumping of j - aggregate lasing microcavities ,  @xcite and non - linear emission in polymer - based microcavities .",
    "@xcite in anthracene , the observation of a threshold for nonlinear emission was accompanied by a significant line narrowing and by a collapse of the emission lifetime . in that case",
    ", a comparison with the best - case estimate of the threshold for conventional lasing inferred from amplified stimulated emission measurements shows that the lasing threshold observed in the strongly coupled microcavity is slightly lower than that anticipated for a conventional laser .",
    "@xcite the temperature dependence of the polariton lasing threshold has also been investigated and shows an order of magnitude decrease from room temperature to low temperatures .",
    "@xcite these experiments demonstrate the high excitation density regime of polariton bosonic stimulation , which could pave the way to the observation in organic based microcavities of other phenomena related to polariton fluidics where weak polariton - polariton interactions may also manifest .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , we develop a semiclassical kinetic model to describe the onset of the non - linear threshold for polariton lasing in anthracene - based microcavities .",
    "we show , in particular , that the mechanism providing the bosonic final - state stimulated formation of the ensemble of lower cavity polaritons is the vibrationally assisted radiative decay of incoherent excitons , previously populated by non - resonant pumping . in section  [ sec : me ] , we set up a minimal master equation to describe the polariton population dynamics , we make a realistic choice of material parameters and we fit the experimental data on the pump dependence of the polariton emission , pointing out the relevance of bimolecular quenching processes . in section  [ sec : scattering ] , we calculate microscopically the efficiency of the relevant scattering process justifying the value obtained from the fit . in section  [ sec : temperature ] , we consider within our model the dependence of the polariton lasing threshold on temperature .",

    "we model the dynamics of the lasing process using a minimal rate - equation approach . in this section",
    ", we estimate the typical time - scale of the mechanism which selectively transfers excitations from the reservoir to the bottom of the polariton branch , without any assumptions regarding its microscopic nature .",
    "the anthracene crystal has two molecules per unit cell and strongly anisotropic optical properties .",
    "@xcite excitations in this material are well - described within the frenkel - exciton framework , which is based on the intramolecular promotion of an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied one . because of molecular dipole - dipole interaction , the excitation can propagate , resulting in two orthogonal transition dipole moments , @xmath0 , directed along the in - plane @xmath1 and @xmath2 axes . when a thin anthracene crystal is placed between two mirrors , light couples to both @xmath3- and @xmath4-polarized excitons and creates two orthogonally - polarized lower polariton branches .",
    "measurements are usually reported for light polarized along @xmath1 and @xmath2 :  @xcite in these cases the @xmath5 and @xmath6 in - cavity light polarizations separately couple to the dipole moments @xmath0 and no mixing effect is present .",
    "we focus only on @xmath4-polarized excitons ,  @xcite i.e. those with largest oscillator strength , for which lasing has been reported  @xcite and neglect other polaritonic and excitonic states .",
    "the initial relaxation of the pump excitations is also neglected , and the presence of an effective excitonic reservoir at a fixed energy independent on the cavity properties is considered .",
    "@xcite we note that the experimental photoluminescence ( pl ) from anthracene microcavities shows always a clear maximum at energy @xmath7 ev regardless of the cavity thickness ,  @xcite and indeed lasing has been achieved in a cavity where the minimum of the lp is exactly at @xmath8 ev .",
    "this is a signature that the microscopic dynamics resulting in the lasing phenomenon is that of a two - level process rather than that of the well - known polariton bottleneck .",
    "we thus develop a two - level master equation for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the surface density of reservoir excitons and of lasing polaritons located near @xmath11 , respectively .",
