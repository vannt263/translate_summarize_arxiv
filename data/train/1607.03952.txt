    "in scalar - tensor theories the gravitational interaction is mediated both by a metric tensor and a scalar field .",
    "the interest in this type of theories of gravity is connected with the expectation that the observed late - time accelerated expansion of the universe may be understood without a dark - energy ( de ) component @xcite .",
    "instead , it is the modified ( compared with einstein s theory ) geometrical sector which is supposed to provide the desired dynamics@xcite .",
    "this may be seen as a geometrization of de .",
    "different aspects of scalar - tensor theories in general or subclasses of them have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "scalar - tensor theories are formulated either in the einstein frame or in the jordan frame .",
    "both frames are related by a conformal transformation .",
    "while matter and scalar field energies are separately conserved in the jordan frame , the dynamics of both components is coupled in the einstein frame for any equation of state ( eos ) different from that of radiation . because of the complex structure of scalar - tensor theories , simple solutions are difficult to obtain , even if the symmetries of the cosmological principle are imposed . hence , in practice , the background expansion rate is usually obtained via numerical integration of the equations of motion . in general , the scalar - tensor - theory based cosmological dynamics may substantially differ from standard cosmology .",
    "our focus here is on the simplest possible extension of the standard @xmath1cdm model that scalar - tensor theory can provide . in this minimalist approach",
    "we remain in the vicinity of the standard model at the present epoch and we aim to quantify the differences between scalar - tensor theory and general relativity ( gr ) by establishing a structure in which the scalar field @xmath0 explicitly enters an analytic solution of the dynamics such that for @xmath2 the standard @xmath1cdm limit is recovered . to this purpose",
    "we construct a simple model which is analytically solved in the einstein frame . with the help of a conformal transformation we then demonstrate how the field @xmath0 , which is given as a certain power of the scale factor , enters the ( jordan - frame ) hubble rate . here",
    "we rely on an effective gr description of the jordan - frame dynamics to determine the geometric equivalent of de .    in more detail ,",
    "our starting point is a simple , analytically tractable expression for the coupling between nonrelativistic matter and the ( einstein frame ) scalar field which modifies the standard decay of the matter energy density with the third power of the cosmic scale factor .",
    "this interaction - triggered deviation of the standard decay in the einstein frame is modeled by a power - law behavior in terms of the einstein - frame scale factor . under this condition and",
    "if additionally an effective energy density and an effective pressure , linked by a constant  bare \" eos parameter , are assumed , an explicit solution of the einstein - frame dynamics is obtained with the mentioned power as an additional parameter .",
    "a straightforward conformal transformation then allows us to obtain the hubble rate and the deceleration parameter in terms of this parameter in the jordan frame as well . for the value zero of such new parameter ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath2 , both frames become indistinguishable and reproduce the dynamics of the standard @xmath1cdm model .",
    "otherwise one has a variable @xmath0 and the dynamics in both frames becomes different , deviating from that of the standard model . the analytic expression for the hubble rate which explicitly clarifies the impact of the scalar field on the cosmological dynamics is the main achievement of this paper .",
    "we shall confront the deviations from the standard model with data from supernovae of type ia ( snia ) , the differential age of old galaxies that have evolved passively ( using @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the hubble rate and @xmath5 is the redshift parameter ) and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
