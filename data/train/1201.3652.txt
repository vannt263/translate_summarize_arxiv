    "at the core of many problems of scientific interest is a spatially extended system that is driven far - from - equilibrium to yield spatiotemporal chaos ( aperiodic dynamics in both space and time )  @xcite .",
    "examples include the dynamics of the weather and climate  @xcite ; fluid turbulence  @xcite ; the intricate patterns that occur for reacting , diffusing and advecting chemicals  @xcite ; and the transition to chaos in excitable media such as cardiac tissue  @xcite .",
    "it is expected for systems such as these that the dimension describing the attractor of the dynamics will be very large . as a result , the powerful ideas of chaotic time series analysis  @xcite , as well as geometrical based approaches for estimating the dimension  @xcite , are difficult to apply and are often ineffective .",
    "however , with the advance and availability of sophisticated parallel algorithms and supercomputing resources these high - dimensional systems are accessible to lyapunov exponent and lyapunov vector based diagnostics .",
    "using the standard approach  @xcite of simultaneously evolving the tangent space equations with frequent gram - schmidt reorthonormalizations allows one to compute the spectrum of lyapunov exponents . with knowledge of the lyapunov exponents",
    "the fractal dimension can be estimated using the well known kaplan - yorke equation  @xcite .",
    "a powerful aspect of this approach is that very large dimensions are now accessible with an algorithm that scales readily to parallel computing resources . using this approach we discuss results for rayleigh - bnard convection which is the buoyancy driven fluid convection that occurs in a shallow fluid layer that is heated uniformly from below .",
    "rayleigh - bnard convection is a canonical system for the study of pattern formation in systems that are driven far - from - equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the study of rayleigh - bnard convection continues to play an important role in building our physical understanding of the complex dynamics that occur in driven spatially - extended systems .",
    "the desire for a quantitative understanding of high - dimensional spatiotemporal chaos for experimentally accessible systems is an important challenge . in this paper",
    "we discuss results for experimentally accessible conditions with fractal dimensions as large as 50 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge this represents the highest dimension dynamics that have been explored using lyapunov based diagnostics for laboratory conditions .",
    "knowledge of the fractal dimension can be used to provide fundamental insights into the underlying chaotic dynamics .",
    "the numerical value of the fractal dimension provides an estimate for the number of chaotic degrees of freedom that are active in the system  @xcite .",
    "given the number of chaotic degrees of freedom that describe the dynamics one can construct estimates for the length scales of these degrees of freedom on average .",
    "in addition , the variation of the fractal dimension with changing system parameters allows one to probe quantitatively how the attractor accommodates different dynamics .    in the literature",
    "there are a number of new insights provided by the study of fluid convection using information gained from computing lyapunov based diagnostics .",

    "@xcite demonstrated that rayleigh - bnard convection exhibited extensive chaos for large periodic domains with aspect ratios @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the side length of the domain , and @xmath3 is the depth of the fluid layer . in this",
    "study the system parameters were chosen to yield the spiral defect chaos state  @xcite .",
    "the spatiotemporal dynamics of the leading order lyapunov vector was studied and was found to be largest in regions where roll pinch - off events were occurring .",
    "it was suggested that the dynamics of these local defects were contributing significantly to the disorder as opposed to the visually striking spiral structures .",
    "scheel and cross  @xcite used the leading - order lyapunov exponent and lyapunov vector to perform a careful study of the time - periodic and chaotic dynamics that occur in a small cylindrical convection layer with @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the radius of the convection domain ) .",
    "they conclude that repeating local defect dynamics involving roll pinch - off events contribute significantly to the short - time lyapunov exponent without affecting the long - time lyapunov exponent .",
    "interestingly , they find that the non - repeating roll pinch - off events are what contribute significantly to the long - time lyapunov exponent .",
    "this raises several interesting questions .",
    "how does the leading order lyapunov exponent discern between repeating and non - repeating events ?",
    "how do the other lyapunov exponents in the lyapunov spectrum respond to these events ? in this paper we will shed some further insight upon these questions .",

    "@xcite computed the spectrum of lyapunov exponents for chaotic convection in cylindrical domains for aspect ratios @xmath7 .",
    "it was determined that rayleigh - bnard convection was extensively chaotic for @xmath8 .",

    "@xcite explored the leading - order lyapunov exponent and lyapunov vector for the domain chaos state that occurs for rayleigh - bnard convection in a rotating domain .",
    "an interesting feature of domain chaos is the presence of propagating fronts as well as localized defect structures .",
    "a careful study revealed that not all defect structures contributed equally to the leading order lyapunov exponent , a result that is in agreement with the findings of scheel and cross  @xcite for the spiral defect chaos state .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed study of chaotic rayleigh - bnard convection using diagnostics based on the spectrum of lyapunov exponents and lyapunov vectors for a range of experimentally relevant conditions . in section",
    "ii we describe the numerical approach used to compute the flow fields , lyapunov exponents , and lyapunov vectors . in section iii",
    "we discuss the dynamics of the lyapunov exponents , the spatiotemporal features of the leading order lyapunov vector , and the variation of the fractal dimension with system parameters .",
    "lastly , in section iv we present our concluding remarks .",
    "rayleigh - bnard convection is the buoyancy - driven motion that results when a thin layer of fluid is heated uniformly from below .",
    "the fluid motion is described by the boussinesq equations , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a unit vector in the @xmath11-direction that opposes gravity , @xmath12 is the prandtl number , @xmath13 is the rayleigh number , @xmath14 is the fluid velocity , @xmath15 is the pressure , and @xmath16 is the temperature .",
    "the equations are nondimensionalized using the layer depth @xmath3 for the length scale , the vertical diffusion time for heat @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the thermal diffusivity for the time scale , and the constant temperature difference between the bottom and top plates @xmath19 as the temperature scale .",
    "the no - slip boundary condition is applied to all material surfaces @xmath20 and the lateral side - walls of the cylindrical domain are assumed to be perfectly conducting @xmath21 the rayleigh number , @xmath22 is the control parameter that is most often varied in experiment .",
    "small values of @xmath13 correspond to simple , often time - independent flows ; intermediate values of @xmath13 correspond to complex chaotic flows as studied here ; and large values of @xmath13 correspond to strongly driven turbulent flows  @xcite .",
    "it will be convenient to use the reduced rayleigh number @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the critical rayleigh number for an infinite layer of fluid .",
    "the prandtl number , @xmath25 is the ratio of momentum and thermal diffusivities . the magnitude of the prandtl number is inversely related to the strength of the mean flow  @xcite .",
    "the mean flow is a weak but long - range flow field that originates from the reynolds stress term and is driven by roll curvature , roll compression , and gradients in the convection amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the mean flow is very difficult to measure experimentally  @xcite and has a dramatic effect upon the linear stability of the convection rolls  @xcite .",
    "its importance is not due to its strength , but because it is a nonlocal effect acting over large distances ( many roll widths ) and advects the pattern  @xcite .",
    "the aspect ratio of the domain @xmath26 is a measure of the spatial extent of the system .",
    "the dynamics of the flow field depends strongly upon the aspect ratio of the fluid layer  @xcite . for small domains",
    "the sidewalls tend to frustrate the dynamics due to the tendency of the convection rolls to approach a sidewall with the roll axis perpendicular to the boundary . in cylindrical domains",
    "this leads to the presence of wall foci which can penetrate several roll wavelengths into the domain .",
    "as the aspect ratio increases the influence of the sidewalls diminishes .",
    "we compute the spectrum of lyapunov exponents @xmath27 using the standard procedure described in detail in ref .  @xcite . for each exponent a set of equations linearized about eqs .",
    "( [ eq : boussinesq1])-([eq : boussinesq3 ] ) are evolved simultaneously to yield the dynamics of perturbations arbitrarily close to the full nonlinear system .",

    "for incompressible fluid flow the pressure is implicitly determined by the requirement of the conservation of mass . as a result , the vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 do not include @xmath15 and @xmath34 , respectively . in our notation , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the jacobian of the flow that results when rewriting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : boussinesq1])-([eq : boussinesq3 ] ) as @xmath37 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the perturbation equations are @xmath38 and @xmath39 at all material walls .",
    "the perturbations are reorthonormalized using a gram - schmidt procedure after a time @xmath40 to yield the magnitude of their growth @xmath41 where the normalization is defined over the interior volume @xmath42 as , @xmath43 dv}. \\label{eq : normal}\\ ] ] each reorthonormalization yields a value of the instantaneous lyapunov exponent , @xmath44 this is repeated and the average value of @xmath45 yields the finite time lyapunov exponent @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of reorthonormalizations performed .",
    "the limit @xmath48 yields the infinite - time lyapunov exponent .",
    "the leading - order exponent @xmath49 describes the growth of the line separating two trajectories in phase space , @xmath50 describes the growth of a two - dimensional area of initial conditions , and @xmath51 describes the growth of an @xmath52-dimensional ball of initial conditions .",
    "the exact number of exponents required for the sum to vanish corresponds to the dimension of the ball of initial conditions that will neither grow nor shrink under the dynamics and is referred to as lyapunov or fractal dimension @xmath53 .",
    "given only the lyapunov exponents , @xmath53 can be determined from the kaplan - yorke formula , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the largest @xmath56 for which @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath53 is the minimum number of active degrees of freedom that contribute to the chaotic dynamics  @xcite .    to solve the system of equations given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : boussinesq1])-([eq : boussinesq3 ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tangent1])-([eq : tangent3 ] ) we used a highly efficient , parallel spectral element code developed to solve the boussinesq equations .",
    "this code has been used in a number of numerical explorations of rayleigh - bnard convection that have been discussed in the literature  ( c.f .",
    "the underlying numerical approach is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and a discussion of its application to rayleigh - bnard convection can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our numerical simulations",
    ", we begin from a small random perturbation on the order of @xmath58 to the linear conduction temperature profile with zero velocity field .",
    "the initial conditions for the tangent space equations are zero perturbation velocity and a random temperature perturbation with a magnitude on the order of @xmath59 .",
    "a typical value of the numerical time step is @xmath60 and we perform a gram - schmidt reorthonormalization every 10 time steps . within each spectral element",
    "we have used 11@xmath61 order polynomials to represent the field variables .    over the course of this work",
    "we have performed numerous tests by varying the numerical parameters used in the code to ensure the validity of our numerical results .",
    "in particular , we have performed simulations for varying time steps and spatial discretizations to ensure that our results for the lyapunov - based diagnostics are accurate and reproducible . for a typical numerical simulation",
    "we integrate the equations for approximately 15 horizontal diffusion times to allow for initial transients to decay .",
    "we then use the numerical data from the latter half of the simulation to compute the lyapunov diagnostics that we report here .",
    "where possible we have included error bars in our results to reflect the variation in the quantities presented based upon our numerical results .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "a fundamental understanding of high - dimensional chaotic dynamics in spatially extended systems remains a vast and important challenge . in this paper , we have used large scale numerics to provide a quantitative link between powerful ideas of dynamical systems theory and a fluid system that can be explored in the laboratory .",
    "we have gone to considerable computational effort to perform simulations for the geometries , boundary conditions , and system parameters that are of experimental relevance .",
    "our computation of the lyapunov based diagnostics provide results that are currently not possible to obtain analytically or experimentally and we have used these to provide new physical insights .",
    "although the lyapunov based diagnostics we have quantified are not directly accessible to experimental measurement , at least not in any straightforward way that we can suggest , the values we present are an important benchmark for comparison as further experimental and theoretical work is conducted .",
    "for example , it may be possible to connect our results with experimental measurements using ideas based upon lagrangian coherent structures  @xcite or computational homology  @xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", our work suggests that it would be interesting to explore the dynamics of the spectrum of lyapunov _ vectors _ using the more recently suggested approach of characteristic lyapunov vectors that satisfy oseledec splitting  @xcite .",
    "overall , we anticipate that our results will be useful to those interested in controlling , predicting , and modeling high - dimensional chaotic systems .",

    "we have also had many fruitful discussions with mike cross , paul fischer , janet scheel , keng - hwee chiam , magnus einarsson , and nicholar oconnor ."
