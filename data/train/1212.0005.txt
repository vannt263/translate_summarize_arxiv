    "the bright saturn nebula ngc7009 is known for its rich and prominent optical recombination lines ( orls ) of heavy element ions , especially those of o  ii , ever since the spectrophotographic observations of wyse @xcite , who published and analyzed deep spectra of the orion nebula and nine planetary nebulae ( pne ) , including ngc7009 .",
    "he identified and measured several dozen o  ii permitted lines in ngc@xmath5 in the wavelength range 3700  6750 , although accurate measurements of many of those o  ii lines were hampered by line blending . at the end of this paper wyse @xcite expressed the desire of having more accurate measurements of the o  ii permitted lines .",
    "aller & kaler @xcite identified more than 100 o  ii permitted lines in the spectrum of ngc7009 .",
    "large numbers of permitted lines of other ionic species , such as c  ii , n  ii , n  iii , o  iii , ne  ii , were also detected .",
    "the majority of these permitted lines are mainly excited by recombination .",
    "other possible excitation mechanisms , such as the dielectronic recombination , radiative charge transfer , and resonance fluorescence by starlight or by some other prominent nebular emission lines , are all by their nature selective , which means that they tend to excite lines from specific spectral terms of certain parity and multiplicity only ( e.g. , grandi @xcite ; liu & danziger @xcite ; liu , danziger & murdin @xcite ) . with high signal - to - noise ratio , high spectral resolution and wide wavelength - coverage spectra of pne now available , more and more orls of fainter intensities from heavy element ions that arise from many different multiplets",
    "are observed and provide an opportunity to study the radiative and dielectronic recombination processes and test the accuracy of the recombination theories for non - hydrogenic ions .",
    "the first systematic study of the orls in ngc7009 was carried out by liu et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter lsbc ) , who analyzed dozens of o  ii orls , using effective recombination coefficients calculated in the intermediate coupling scheme for transitions from the 3d3p and 4f3d arrays , and coefficients calculated in the _ ls_coupling scheme for transitions from the 3p  3s array .",
    "lsbc found clear deviations from the _ ls_coupling in the 3d3p and 4f3d transitions .",
    "luo , liu & barlow ( @xcite , hereafter llb01 ) presented high - quality observations of several dozens ne  ii orls in ngc7009 , and derived the ne@xmath1/h@xmath2 abundance ratios from them .",
    "along with the advance of observational techniques that have enabled the detections of many faint orls of heavy element ions in photoionized gaseous nebulae , the recombination theories of heavy element ions , such as c  ii , n  ii , o  ii , and ne  ii , have seen steady improvements since early 1980s ( e.g. storey @xcite ; nussbaumer & storey @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; escalante & victor @xcite ; pquignot , petitjean & boisson @xcite ; storey @xcite ; lsbc ; kisielius et al .",

    "the high - quality atomic data have been widely used to reveal the physical conditions ( electron temperatures and densities ) under which the orls of heavy element ions arise , and to determine ionic and elemental abundances from them ( e.g. liu et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in nebular astrophysics",
    "there has been a long - standing dichotomy whereby the ionic and elemental abundances of c , n , o and ne relative to hydrogen determined from orls ( e.g. c  ii m6 @xmath64267 , n  ii m39b @xmath64041 , o  ii m1 @xmath64649 and m48a @xmath64089 , ne  ii m55e @xmath64392 ) are systematically higher than those derived from the much brighter collisionally excited lines ( cels , often referred to as forbidden lines ) . with high - quality optical spectra now available , detailed studies of this problem have been carried out for several archetypal pne ( lsbc and llb01 for ngc7009 ; liu et al .",

    "@xcite , b ; robertson - tessi & garnett @xcite ; wesson , liu & barlow @xcite ; wang & liu @xcite ) .",
    "the abundance discrepancy factors ( adfs ) , defined as the ratio of the abundance derived from orls to that deduced from cels , typically lie in the range 13 .",
    "but for a significant number of pne , adf values exceeding 5 , or even 10 , are seen .",
    "the highest adf value ( @xmath370 ) of all pne is found in hf2 - 2 ( liu et al .",
    "another dichotomy that is closely related to the problem of abundance discrepancy is that nebular electron temperatures derived from the traditional diagnostic [ o  iii ] nebular - to - auroral line ratio are generally higher than those derived from the balmer jump ( bj ) of hydrogen recombination spectrum ( e.g. peimbert @xcite ; liu & danziger @xcite ) .",
    "a number of postulations have been raised to explain these problems ( e.g. peimbert @xcite ; rubin @xcite ; viegas & clegg @xcite ) , but all failed to provide a consistent interpretation of all the available observations .",
    "recenltly , nicholls , dopita & sutherland @xcite explored the possibility that electrons in h  ii regions and pne depart from a maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium energy distribution and suggested that a  @xmath7-distribution \" for the electron energies , which are widely found in solar system plasmas , can explain the temperature and abundance discrepancies in h  ii regions and pne . the bi - abundance nebular model proposed by liu et al .",
    "@xcite , who postulated that pne ( probably also h  ii regions ) contain h - deficient inclusions , provides a better and natural explanation of the dichotomy . in this model ,",
    "the faint orls of heavy element ions originate mainly from the  cold \" , h - deficient inclusions , while the stronger cels are emitted from the warmer ambient plasma with ` normal ' chemical composition .",
    "deep spectroscopic surveys and recombination line analysis of individual nebulae in the past decade has yielded strong evidence for the existence of such a  cold \" component ( see recent reviews by liu @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is the second of the two papers devoted to very deep spectroscopy of ngc7009 . in the previous paper ( fang & liu @xcite , hereafter paper  i )",
    ", we presented high - quality spectra of ngc7009 and tabulation of all detected lines , including their observed and dereddened intensities , many of which were obtained via careful deblending using the technique of multi - gaussian profile fitting .",
    "we also carried out plasma diagnostics using the cel ratios , the h  i recombination spectrum ( including the balmer and paschen decrements of the line spectrum , and the balmer and paschen jumps of the continuum spectrum ) , and the he  i and he  ii recombination spectrum ( including the he  i recombination line ratios , and discontinuities of the he  i and he  ii recombination continua ) . the average electron temperature yielded by cels , @xmath8(cels ) , is higher than that from the h  i balmer jump , @xmath8(h  i  bj ) , which in turn is higher than the temperature derived from the he  i recombination line ratios , @xmath8(he  i ) .",
    "the current paper focuses on analyses of the optical recombination spectra of heavy element ions detected in the spectrum of ngc7009 .",
    "new effective recombination coefficients , including those for the n  ii and o  ii recombination spectrum that were calculated in the intermediate coupling scheme , are now available and are utilized in the analyses .",
    "plasma diagnostics based on the orls of heavy element ions are carried out in section2 , and the electron temperatures derived from the n  ii and o  ii orl ratios agree with each other and are both close to 1200  k. thus the general pattern of electron temperatures , @xmath8(cels ) @xmath9 @xmath8(h  i  bj ) @xmath9 @xmath8(he  i ) @xmath9 @xmath8(n  ii , o  ii  orls ) , which was predicted by the bi - abundance nebular model ( liu @xcite ) and has been seen in many pne , is confirmed in the current analysis of ngc7009 . a comprehensive analysis of individual multiplets of the c  ii , n  ii , o  ii , and ne  ii recombination spectra are presented in section3 .",
    "the lines are critically examined for potential blending effects .",
    "comparison is made for the observed and predicted relative intensities of the best observed transitions , using the latest effective recombination coefficients .",
    "ionic and elemental abundances are derived in section4 , where adfs for the c , n , o , and ne ionic abundances are calculated .",
    "the results are discussed in section5 , followed by a summary in section6 .",
    "reliable atomic data , most importantly the effective recombination coefficients of abundant heavy element ions such as c  ii , n  ii , o  ii , and ne  ii , are key to the spectroscopic analysis of photoionized gaseous nebulae .",
    "most of the _ ab  initio _ calculations of heavy element ions aimed for astrophysical applications hitherto were carried out in the _ ls_coupling scheme .",
    "this approximation tacitly assumes a statistical distribution in the population of the fine - structure levels of the recombining ions ( i.e. , 1:2 for the n@xmath1 @xmath10p@xmath11 and @xmath10p@xmath12 levels in the case of n  ii ; 1:3:5 for the o@xmath1 @xmath13p@xmath14 , @xmath13p@xmath15 and @xmath13p@xmath16 levels in the case of o  ii ) .",
    "the assumption of _ ls_coupling may give satisfactory results for some of the low - lying transitions such as those belonging to the 3p3s configuration , but not for many of the transitions from the higher 3d3p or 4f3d configurations .",
    "in low - density objects such as h  ii regions and evolved pne , the relative populations of the ground - term fine - structure levels of the recombining ion actually have density - dependence and deviate from the statistical distribution , and so do the relative emissivities of resultant recombination lines .",
    "a better treatment of the recombination and the following cascading in a proper coupling scheme is vital for probing the physical conditions in gaseous nebulae .",
