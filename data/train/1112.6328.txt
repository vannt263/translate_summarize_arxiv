    "the latter indicate a stiff nuclear matter eos at high density . in the following",

    "the hulse - taylor pulsar psr b1913 + 16 had the highest precisely known mass of @xmath7m@xmath8 , with most pulsars clustering around this value @xcite . however , the observation of @xmath6 and shapiro delay in the low mass x - ray binary j1903 - 0327 @xcite allowed the determination of the mass for the corresponding millisecond pulsar to @xmath9m@xmath8 . in 2010 ,",

    "the dynamical effects of phase transitions on neutron stars and core - collapse sne were first discussed by migdal @xcite in 1979 , and later studied by takahara and sato @xcite as well as brown @xcite . in the early 90s , gentile et al .",
    "@xcite performed general relativistic hydrodynamic core - collapse sn simulations including a phase transition to strange quark matter for critical densities of @xmath12 .",
    "the authors tested different setups of the quark - hadron mixed phase , finding the formation of two shock waves .",
    "the first shock wave is caused by the usual stiffening of the hadronic eos for @xmath13 , which halts and reverts the infall of matter in the center of the collapsing iron core ( core - bounce ) .",
    "the second wave is formed due to the softening of the eos in the quark - hadron mixed phase together with the subsequent stiffening in pure quark matter . as neutrino transport",
    "was not included in the calculations , the dynamics of the shock waves could only be followed for a few ms .",
    "simulations including neutrino transport were performed by e.g. nakazato et al . @xcite .",

    "the quark - hadron phase transition was modeled by a gibbs construction @xcite .",
    "the studied progenitor stars had masses of @xmath15m@xmath8 , whereas the gravitational collapse of such massive stars usually ends with the production of a black hole @xcite . due to the softer hybrid eos",
    ", the onset of quark matter accelerates the black hole formations by tens to hundreds of ms in comparison to simulations with the original shen eos . while the earlier collapse results in a shortening of the neutrino emission , the softening of the eos influences the neutrino spectra .",
    "both effects can be used as indicators for a quark matter phase transition . however , as hyperons and different nuclear interactions @xcite can have similar imprints on the neutrino signal , further studies are required . in this work",

    "figure [ mr_plot1 ] shows the mass - radius relations for different parameter sets in eq.([bag_eos ] ) .",
    "hadronic matter is described by the relativistic mean field tm1 model @xcite which is also the basis for the shen eos .",
    "the three parameter sets with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , shown in fig",
    ".  [ mr_plot1 ] , have been tested on their impact in one dimensional sn simulations based on general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics and three flavor boltzmann neutrino transport @xcite .",
    "the simulations show that due to the low critical densities , the quark - hadron mixed phase sets in already at core - bounce , when matter in the center of the collapsing iron core reaches densities around @xmath16 .",
    "however , as the quark fraction is small and @xmath26 , the hybrid eos is very similar to the one of hadronic matter @xcite , and the dynamics proceed like in a normal core - collapse sn for the first @xmath27ms .",
    "the core - bounce launches a hydrodynamic shock wave which starts to propagates outwards . on its way",
    ", it loses energy due to the disintegration of infalling heavy nuclei and production of neutrinos . as the shock wave moves across the neutrinospheres ,",
    "the neutrinos are emitted in a burst dominated by electron neutrinos @xmath28 .",
    "this energy loss turns the expanding shock into a standing accretion shock ( sas ) .",
    "as shock - heated matter continues to be accreted through the sas on the surface of the proto neutron star ( pns ) , the density and temperature in its interior rise and a growing volume of the pns enters the mixed phase . the quark fraction in the mixed phase increases which leads to a softening of the eos .",
    "this , together with the growing gravitational mass of the pns eventually triggers its collapse to a more compact hybrid star configuration .",
    "similar to the study of gentile et al .",
    ", a second shock wave forms and propagates outwards . shock heating of the infalling neutron rich matter leads to the production of @xmath29 , as well as @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , which are released in a second burst as the second shock wave propagates across the neutrinospheres .    , and @xmath32 .",

    "the critical densities for the onset of the mixed phase for @xmath36 are around @xmath37 , however , due to the similar stiffness of the quark and hadron eoss , the mixed phase extends up to @xmath38 for low t. as the temperature rises above @xmath39mev , the mixed phase experiences a significant reduction and the critical densities become low .",
    "however , for such high values of @xmath4 , the inclusion of pions and hadron resonances becomes important and would most likely change the shape of the phase diagram .    .",

    "we find that quark matter appears very late - around @xmath43s after core bounce and does not influence the sn dynamics @xcite .",
    "the reason for this outcome can be seen in fig .",
    "[ phase_diag_as07_a ] which shows the onset of the mixed phases for the discussed quark eoss .",

    "in addition we plot the densities and temperatures in the center of the pns shortly before and during the first @xmath40ms after the core - bounce . while it can be seen that for the soft models , matter in the pns enters the quark - hadron mixed phase , the critical densities for the new parameter set are too high .",

    "the onset of strangeness in core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) can be studied by implementing hyperons and strange quark matte in sn equations of state ( eoss ) .",
    "hereby , the chosen parameter sets must fulfill restrictions from the recent finding of a two solar mass pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 , which is only compatible with a stiff high density nuclear matter eos .",
    "within currently applied quark eos models , high critical densities were shown to shorten the time to black hole formation in the gravitational collapse of massive progenitor stars .",
    "for the onset of quark matter with a soft eos at critical densities @xmath17 around nuclear matter saturation density @xmath45@xmath1 , the proto neutron star collapses to a more compact hybrid star configuration within hundreds of ms after core - bounce .",
    "this launches a shock wave which leads to the sn explosion and releases a neutrino burst , dominated by @xmath29 .",
    "the properties of the neutrino burst are dependent on @xmath17 as well as the model of the progenitor star .",
