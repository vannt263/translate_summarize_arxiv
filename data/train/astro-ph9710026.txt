    "damped ly@xmath0 ( dla ) absorbers are the class of qso intervening systems with highest hydrogen column density , @xmath3 atoms @xmath4 . several properties of these absorbers indicate that they are high - redshift progenitors of present - day galaxies ( wolfe et al .",
    "1986 , wolfe et al .",
    "spectroscopic observations show , in addition to high hi column densities , metal lines of low ionization and velocity dispersions typical of gas rich galaxies .",
    "imaging studies of fields around qsos with foreground dla absorption at low redshift ( @xmath5 ) reveal the presence of gas - rich galaxies with a variety of morphological types ( le brun et al .",
    "an indepedent and remarkable piece of evidence in favour of a galactic origin comes from the behaviour of @xmath6 , the comoving mass density of neutral gas in dla absorbers in units of the critical density of the universe .",
    "the fact that @xmath7 equals the mass density of luminous matter ( stars ) at the present epoch , and that @xmath6 decreases with time , is interpreted as evidence of gas consumption due to star formation since @xmath8 to the present time ( wolfe et al .",
    "1995 ) . at high redshift @xmath6 is at least 10% of the barionic content of the universe and therefore understanding the nature of dla galaxies will give important contraints to cosmological models involving structure formation in the early universe ( klypin et al .",
    "a commonly accepted origin of dla absorbers is in spiral galaxies , ( wolfe et al .",
    "1995 , prochaska & wolfe 1997b ) , but an origin in dwarf galaxies has also been suggested ( york et al .",
    "1986 ; tyson 1988 ; pettini , boksenberg & hunstead 1990 ; molaro et al . 1996 ; matteucci , molaro & vladilo 1997 ) .    studies of elemental abundances in dla systems give important clues for understanding which kind(s ) of galaxies are responsible for the absorption .",
    "in addition , the study of dla abundances over a large redshift interval will eventually allow us to trace the chemical evolution of the absorbers over a large interval of look - back time , up to the early stages of galactic nucleosynthesis , providing fundamental tests to models of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "abundance measurements in dla systems do not depend critically on ionization corrections because these absorbers are optically thick to ionizing radiation ( h@xmath9 ev ) . as a consequence , species that are dominant in hi regions have negligible ionization corrections , as confirmed by detailed photoionization calculations ( lu et al .",
    "1995 ; viegas 1995 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the abundances observed in dla absorbers may not represent the real chemical composition of the system if part of the elements is removed from the gas to the solid phase ( dust grains ) , as it happens in the interstellar medium of our galaxy where elements with very different dust depletions are known to exist ( jenkins 1987 ; savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "in dla absorbers the relative abundances of elements expected to have different dust depletions , such as zn and cr , suggest that dust is indeed present , even though with a lower dust - to - gas ratio than in the galaxy ( pettini et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "more direct evidence for dust in dla systems has been found from reddening studies of qsos with and without foreground damped absorption ( pei , fall & bechtold , 1991 ) .",
    "a relatively large number of abundance determinations in dla absorbers has been collected since it has become possible to observe qsos at sufficiently high spectral resolution ( see list of references quoted in table 2 ) .",
    "attempts to interpret the relative abundances ( i.e. element - to - element abundance ratios ) observed in dla absorbers have lead , however , to contradictory conclusions . from one side claims have been made that the pattern of relative abundances resembles that of galactic halo stars , having in common an enhancement of the alpha elements and a deficiency of manganese relative to iron ( lu et al .",
    "1996 , prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) . from the other side ,",
    "evidence has been presented for nearly solar [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in spite of the low metallicity level of the absorbers ( molaro et al .",
    "1996 , molaro et al .",
    "these contradictory conclusions are probably due to the fact that the presence of dust in dla absorbers is not properly taken into account .",
    "several attempts have been done to reproduce the observed abundances by combining different intrinsic abundance patterns with dust depletion patterns of galactic interstellar type ( lauroesch et al .",
    "1996 ; kulkarni , fall & truran 1997 ) . according to these studies , neither a halo - like nor a solar - like metallicity pattern match the observations perfectly . in the present work the effect of the dust on the determinations of the elemental abundances is studied in detail by deriving equations that take into account the level of metallicity , the dust - to - gas ratio and the intrinsic abundance pattern of dla absorbers .",
    "differently from the analysis performed by kulkarni , fall & truran ( 1997 ) , in the present study each individual dla system is treated separately and the extinction induced by the dust is taken explicitely into account . the general equations that link observed abundances to real abundances of the absorbers are presented in section 2 .",
    "simplified forms of these equations are then used in section 3 to predict possible dust depletion patterns in dla systems . in section 4",
    "is presented the method for estimating dust - to - metals ratios , dust - to - gas ratios and dust - corrected abundances in individual dla absorbers ; the method is applied to available abundance measurements of dla systems .",
    "the relations between dust and metals in dla absorbers are examined in section 5 .",
    "the implications for our understanding of the nature of dla galaxies are discussed in section 6 and the results are summarized in section 7 .",
    "the observed abundance ratio by number ( x / h)@xmath10 of an element x in a dla absorber is determined from measurements of the column densities in the gas phase of the system , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the observed abundance",
    "is usually expressed in logarithmic form relative to solar composition @xmath13_{{\\rm obs}}= \\log ( {   { { \\rm x}}\\over { { \\rm h } } } ) _ { { \\rm obs}}-     \\log ( {   { { \\rm x}}\\over { { \\rm h } } } ) _ { \\sun }   ~.\\ ] ] however , this is not the real abundance since the column density of atoms in dust , @xmath14 , is not considered in ( 1 ) . the total column density ( @xmath15 ) would instead give the real ratio ( x / h)@xmath16 and hence the real abundance @xmath13_{{\\rm dla}}=   \\log ( {   { { \\rm x}}\\over { { \\rm h } } } ) _ { { \\rm dla}}-                     \\log ( {   { { \\rm x}}\\over { { \\rm h } } } ) _ { \\sun } ~.\\ ] ] by introducing the _ fraction in dust _ of the element x @xmath17 it is easy to derive a relation between the observed and the real abundance @xmath13_{{\\rm obs}}= \\left [ { { { \\rm x}}\\over { { \\rm h } } } \\right]_{{\\rm dla}}+   \\log   \\left (   1 - f_{{{\\rm x } } }   \\right )    ~~.\\ ] ]    to introduce the effect of the dust in the above expression we start by defining the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the extinction optical depth in the spectral region of interest in the rest frame of the absorber .",
    "the above definition is the same of pei , fall & bechtold ( 1991 ) provided the hydrogen column density@xmath20 is expressed in units of 10@xmath21 @xmath4 .",
    "if we call @xmath22 the column density of dust grains per unit area along the line of sight , the optical depth is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the _ average extinction cross - section of the grains_. for spherical grains of radius @xmath25 the cross - section for extinction is @xmath26 where the efficiency factor for extinction @xmath27 can be estimated in the framework of mie scattering theory ( see e.g. wickramasinghe 1967 ) . if we call @xmath28 the number of grains with radii in the range ( @xmath25,@xmath29 ) per unit volume , then it is possible to define @xmath30 through the relation @xmath31 we will use , however , the most general form ( 6 ) to avoid any assumption on the geometry of the grains .",
    "we then define the _ average number of atoms of the element x per dust grain _",
    "@xmath32 which is related to the chemical composition of the dust since the number ratio of two elements x and y in the dust grains will be ( x / y)@xmath33 = @xmath34 .    from ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 )",

    "relation ( 9 ) is not suited for comparing observed and real abundances because it includes several unknown quantities . in order to obtain a more useful relation",
    "it is convenient to normalize the quantities in the dla absorbers in units of the corresponding galactic quantities .",

    "this expression for the fractions in dust can be written in a simpler form if we require the condition @xmath45 for any element , which is equivalent to assume that _ the dust has same chemical composition and same average number of atoms per grain as galactic dust .",
    "_ this equivalence follows from the fact that the relative abundance of two elements in the dust is @xmath46 .",
    "a constant relative abundance in the dust is consistent with current understanding of grains chemical composition ( see e.g. discussion in section 12.2 and 12.3 by savage & sembach 1996 ) . in practice ,",
    "once the chemical composition and the average number of atoms are specified , also the grain sizes are specified . therefore , also the extinction coefficient , which depends on the dielectric properties and geometry of the grains is determined , the only left degree of freedom being the exact shape of the grains .",
    "therefore , once the condition @xmath45 is satisfied , also condition @xmath47 is virtually satisfied , and hence @xmath48 .",

    "the fractions in dust @xmath44 can be considered as input parameters which are known with reasonable accuracy from galactic interstellar studies , as we show in the next section .",
    "by analogy to the definition of logarithmic dust depletion in the galactic interstellar medium @xmath52 we define the dust depletion in dla systems as @xmath53 where the number ratios @xmath54 are measured in the gas phase in each case .",

    "iron is used as the zero point for the metallicity level .",
    "we have computed the fractions in dust @xmath44 from ( 15 ) by adopting dust depletions typical of galactic warm disk ( savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "more details are given in the notes to table 1 .",

    "the case s100 is nothing else than the galactic depletion pattern for low density lines of sight ( galactic warm disk ) . by comparing this pattern with the cases s75 and",
    "s50 one can see that the absolute values of the depletions decrease when the dust - to - metals ratio is reduced . however , _",
    "the scaling law of the differential depletion is not linear _",
    ", contrary to what assumed in previous works ( see e.g. lauroesch et al .",
    "rather , _ the differential depletion between pairs of elements tends to vanish as the dust - to - metals ratio decreases_. this implies that elements moderately depleted in the galaxy can still have a non negligible depletion when less dust is present . as an example , si depletion decreases by only 0.3 dex , compared to a decrease of 1 dex of fe , when @xmath57 is reduced from 1.0 to 0.5 .",
    "more surprising results are found when an abundance pattern different from the solar one is considered . in the columns labeled h100 , h75 , and",
    "h50 we give the depletions expected for an intrinsic abundance pattern typical of galactic halo stars , again for dust - to - metals ratios @xmath57 = 1.00 , 0.75 and 0.50 , respectively .",
    "the adopted values of halo star abundances are taken from francois ( 1988 ) , sneden , gratton & crocker ( 1991 ) , and ryan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , at a metallicity level @xmath60 characteristic of dla absorbers ; we refer to the notes in table 1 for more details .",
    "the very small deviations from the solar pattern found for [ cr / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] are treated here as real to show how even small deviations can affect the dust depletion pattern . from the results shown in table 1",
    "one can see that _ inversions in the differential depletion pattern may appear if the dla abundance pattern is not solar .",
    "_ for instance , underabundant elements such as mn and cr are more depleted than fe in halo - like models , contrary to what found in galactic interstellar gas .",
    "overabundant elements tend , on the other hand , to be less depleted . as an example , ti depletion is quite modest in halo - like models while it is comparable to iron depletion in galactic gas .",
    "it is also interesting to note that _ no solutions are allowed for underabundant elements with high fraction in dust ( @xmath61 ) unless the dust - to - metals ratio is sufficiently low .",

    "instead of using eq .",
    "( 12 ) to estimate the effect of a given dla abundance pattern on the observed abundances , we will follow the opposite approach of deriving the real abundance pattern starting from the observed ratios . by applying eq .",
    "( 12 ) to the elements x and y and combining the resulting equations it is possible to find the real abundance ratio @xmath64_{{\\rm dla } } }       = 10^ {      \\left [   { { { \\rm x}}\\over { { \\rm y } } }   \\right]_{{\\rm obs } } } +       {   { \\tilde{k}}\\over { \\tilde{z } } }    \\cdot     \\left (       f_{{{\\rm x}},{{\\rm ism } } }    -         f_{{{\\rm y}},{{\\rm ism } } }   \\cdot 10^ {   \\left [ { { { \\rm x}}\\over { { \\rm y } } } \\right]_{{\\rm obs } } }    \\right)\\ ] ] from the observed abundance ratio .",

    "( 17 ) can be applied to other elements for deriving their intrinsic abundance .",
    "this method can be applied to individual dla systems for which suitable abundances measurements are available . in the following sub - sections we describe the results of the application of this procedure to currently available measurements .      in order to determine the dust - to - metals ratio from eq . ( 18 ) we need at least two elements for which @xmath65_{{\\rm dla}}= 0   $ ] in dla systems .",
    "studies of metal poor stars in the galaxy indicate that iron - peak elements elements generally trace each other down to metallicities comparable to those found in dla absorbers ( see third column of table 1 and references quoted therein ) .",
    "a relatively large amount of observations of iron - peak elements are available for dla systems , as can be seen in the updated summary of measurements presented in table 2 .",
    "the use of iron - peak elements is therefore the most natural choice to determine the dust - to - metals ratio .",
    "however , a few caveats have to be considered",
    ". from one side , observed dla [ mn / fe ] ratios show an underabundance which is difficult to understand in terms of dust depletion ( lu et al .",
    "in addition , some deviations from solar ratios are found in metal - poor stars for [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] , [ co / fe ] ( ryan et al .",
    "1996 ) , and for [ cu / fe ] ( sneden , gratton & crocker 1991 ) . for cr , however , these deviations are significant only at [ fe / h ] @xmath67 and are negligible at the metallicity level typical of dla systems . taking also into account the number of available measurements , this leaves zn , fe and cr as the best candidates for using eq . (",
    "thanks to the long - standing observational effort of pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) , a relatively large number of zn and cr measurements are available .",
    "these overlap in many cases with fe ( and sometimes ni ) determinations based on keck observations ( lu et al .",
    "1996 and refs . therein ) .",
    "the form of the denominator of the right side of ( 18 ) indicates that the use of any pair of elements with similar fractions in dust and gas - phase abundances must be avoided , because a small observational error would lead to a large error in the dust - to - metals ratio .",
    "this precludes the use of cr and fe , as can be seen in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "since zn has a much smaller fraction in dust than cr and fe we have determined the dust - to - metals ratio from ( 18 ) by using zn as the element x and cr or fe as the element y.    table 2 includes the 17 dla systems for which a zn measurement exists , rather than an upper limit , together with a cr or fe determination .",
    "the resulting dust - to - metals ratios are shown in table 3 . in 8 cases",
    "the determinations are obtained independently from [ zn / cr ] and [ zn / fe ] ratios .",
    "we do not find a systematic difference between the 8 results in common , the average percent difference being @xmath68 .",
    "this agreement gives us confidence on the method adopted and on the assumption that these elements indeed trace each other in dla systems , at least down to the level of metallicity of the present sample .",
    "for these 8 cases we adopt the average of the two independent determinations as the final dust - to - metals ratio . for the other cases we adopt the individual result , being confident that fe vs. cr systematic effects should be negligible .",
    "an attempt to derive the dust - to - metals ratio using [ zn / ni ] leads to values systematically higher by about 20% than the values derived from [ zn / cr ] and [ zn / fe ] .",
    "this suggests that a weak deviation from solar iron - peak relative composition may be present for ni , even though the suspect has been advanced that ni abundances could be affected by uncertainties in the niii oscillator strengths ( lu et al .",
    "1996 ) . for these reasons ,",
    "dust - to - metals ratios determined from [ zn / ni ] ratios are not considered here .",
    "the typical random error of the dust - to - metals ratio derived in this way can be estimated by neglecting the contribution of @xmath69 in the denominator of the right side of ( 18 ) .",
    "the error of the dust - to - metals ratio equals that of the [ zn / y ] measurement , which is typically of 0.1 dex , although in some cases it can be as low as 0.05 dex .",
    "in addition to this random error , systematic errors are introduced through the galactic fractions in dust used in ( 18 ) . to quantify this effect",
    "we computed the dust - to - metals in two cases : ( i ) zinc completely undepleted , i.e. @xmath70 , and ( ii ) zinc mildly depleted , with @xmath71 .",
    "the resulting dust - to - metals ratios , also shown in table 3 , are systematically lower by @xmath72 20% in the first case relative to the second case .",
    "uncertainties in fe and cr fractions in dust would yield a much smaller systematic error since @xmath73 for current range of fe and cr dust depletions observed in galactic interstellar clouds .",
    "having derived the @xmath74 ratio for individual dla systems we can now use relation ( 17 ) to estimate relative abundances corrected from dust effects . in table 4",
    "we list additional abundance measurements available for the dla systems of the sample shown in table 3 .",
    "dust - corrected relative abundances are given in table 4 below each gas - phase determination and are shown in a synoptic view in fig .",
    "1 . internal errors of the corrected relative abundances are quite low , as estimated from the dispersion of the 5 [ si / fe ] measurements , @xmath75 dex , and of the 7 [ ni / fe ] measurements , @xmath76 dex . by applying error propagation to ( 17 )",
    "one can see that the total random error of the dust - corrected ratios is typically @xmath72 0.15 dex , but can be as low as @xmath72 0.05 dex for the most precise measurements .",
    "in addition , systematic errors related to the uncertainty of the @xmath44 and @xmath77 parameters should be taken into account . the use of dust - to - metals ratios derived by assuming zinc completely undepleted",
    "would systematically reduce the dust corrections ; however , the net effect on the corrected ratios is in most cases less than 0.05 dex .    a first result clear from fig .",
    "1 is that the spread of the dust - corrected relative abundances for any given [ x / fe ] ratio is generally within the range of the expected errors , suggesting that _ the sample of dla systems investigated is chemically homogeneous over the range of metallicities from nearly solar down to 1.5 dex . _",
    "the most important result visible if fig .",
    "1 , however , comes from the analysis of the element - to - element abundance pattern . if the intrinsic abundances of dla systems were similar to metal - poor galactic halo stars , the ratios shown in fig .",
    "1 should deviate from the solar pattern , with the only exception of [ ni / fe ] . quite surprisingly _ the dust - corrected ratios are remarkably close to solar .",
    "_ errors due to uncertainties of the fractions in dust @xmath44 and @xmath77 should produce different effects for any given pair of elements x and y , and would tend to destroy the solar - like pattern .    of course , as we discuss in detail in the following paragraphs , the relative abundances are not _ exactly _ solar .",
    "it is also important to note here that departures from solar ratios in dla systems are found when nitrogen abundances are considered ( lu 1997 , priv .",

    "( 1996 ) to suspect the presence of a constant offset between stellar and dla measurements .",
    "our results can be instead explained in terms of the expected trends of iron - peak elements .",
    "the ratios of alpha elements to iron - peak elements is the best indicator of halo - like metallicity pattern . in the early stages of chemical evolution",
    "the products of type ii snae , rich in alpha elements , are expected to dominate the observed abundances and to produce the overabundance of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio which is observed in galactic metal - poor stars . at later stages",
    ", the contribution of type ia snae reduces the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio to the typical values observed in galactic stars of solar metallicity ( see e.g. matteucci , molaro & vladilo 1997 ) . at a metallicity",

    "however , as we have shown in section 3 , even a mild underabundance of the [ mn / fe ] ratio can lead to an inversion of the dust depletion pattern , manganese becoming more depleted than iron .",
    "this explains why the dust correction can increase the observed [ mn / fe ] ratio , as it happens in the two cases shown in table 4 .",
    "the dust corrected ratios indicate in fact a modest underabundance of manganese .",
    "this underabundance is smaller than expected for a halo - like chemical composition and the [ mn / fe ] ratio is marginally consistent with a solar composition .",
    "we note that this conclusion does not depend on the adopted cosmic abundance for manganese . for consistency with the results of ryan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) we have renormalized the dla measurements by adopting solar photospheric abundance for mn , instead of the solar meteoric value used by lu et al . (",
    "should we adopt the meteoritic value , we would find a [ mn / fe ] lower by 0.14 dex in the dla systems , but also the [ mn / fe ] ratio for galactic halo stars should be decreased , down to [ mn / fe ] = @xmath88 dex , and the dust corrected ratios would still be in between the solar - like and the halo - like case .",
    "the basic assumption of the present work is that dust affects the observed abundances in dla absorbers .",
    "we can test this assumption by comparing the dust - to - gas ratios derived from the observed abundances with dust - to - gas ratios obtained from reddening determinations .",

    "this method is conceptually similar to that originally used by pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for estimating the dust - to - gas ratio from cr and zn abundances .    on the basis of what discussed in section 4.1",
    "we have used the [ zn / h ] and [ cr / h ] ratios , and the [ zn / h ] and [ fe / h ] ratios , to derive @xmath50 from ( 19 ) for our sample of 17 dla systems .",

    "we do not find a systematic difference between the results based on the [ zn / h ] and [ cr / h ] ratios and the results based on the [ zn / h ] and [ fe / h ] ratios .",
    "the average percent difference between the two cases is @xmath90 . by applying random error propagation to ( 19 ) , keeping fixed the galactic fractions in dust @xmath91 and @xmath92",

    "this is not surprising since two independent measurements are required to determine @xmath50 from ( 19 ) and only one to determine @xmath74 from ( 18 ) .",
    "systematically lower dust - to - gas ratios by about @xmath930.2 dex would be derived by assuming zinc completely undepleted .",
    "the resulting dust - to - gas ratios span a wide interval , from about 1% to 75% the galactic value , without a concentration around a particular value .",
    "the logarithmic average yields @xmath94 , which implies that the most probable interval lies between 2% and 25% the galactic value .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the most probable range found by pei , fall & bechtold ( 1991 ) in their study of qsos with and without foreground dla absorbers , which is between 5% and 20% .",
    "the combined sample used by these authors includes 22 qsos with foreground dla absorber , 7 of these systems being in common with the present sample .",
    "the quantitative agreement between the two independent extinction estimates supports the validity of the assumption that dust is responsible for the apparent deviations of the [ zn / cr ] and [ zn / fe ] ratios from solar composition . by assuming zinc",
    "completely undepleted , our results indicate a most probable range from 1% up to 16% of the galactic value .",
    "even if this interval still overlaps with the best range of pei , fall & bechtold ( 1991 ) , the mild zinc depletion adopted here yields a better agreement .",
    "once we have determined the dust - to - gas ratio , the metallicity corrected by dust can be determined from the relation @xmath95_{{\\rm obs } } }     + { \\tilde{k}}\\cdot     f_{{{\\rm y}},{{\\rm ism}}}\\ ] ] which results by applying eq .",

    "it is worth noting , however , that even a small amount of zinc depletion in the galaxy still implies a small but measurable amount of depletion in dla absorbers .",
    "this can be understood from our previous discussion in section 3 .",
    "an important by - product of the present investigation is the determination of dust - to - gas ratios and metallicities in individual dla systems .",
    "we start by analysing the dust - to - metals ratio @xmath96 , which is less affected by error propagation than the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath50 . the logarithmic average yields @xmath97 , which implies a typical value around 62% and the most probable range between 42% and 89% the galactic dust - to - metals content .",
    "an attempt to find correlations of @xmath74 with metallicity or with redshift gives negative results .",
    "we conclude that in the present sample of 17 dla systems _ the dust - to - metals ratio is approximately constant and lower than in the galaxy .",
    "_ the average dust - to - metals ratio that we find is comparable with the value @xmath98 obtained by pettini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) by assuming zinc completely undepleted .",
    "the constancy of the @xmath96 ratio implies that dust - to - gas ratio and metallicities are correlated in dla systems .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "2 , where we plot @xmath50 versus metallicity @xmath51 for our sample of 17 dla systems .",
    "filled diamonds represent the 8 systems with most accurate measurements , based on two independent @xmath50 determinations in each case .",
    "the other systems , with one single @xmath50 determination are indicated with empty diamonds .",
    "the linear regression through the 17 dla data points confirms the existence of a correlation , with slope 1.16 and correlation coefficient @xmath99 ( dotted line in the figure ) . by using only the 8 systems with most accurate measurements we find a correlation with slope 0.98 and @xmath99 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the slope is therefore 1 within the errors , as expected for a constant @xmath96 ratio .",
    "the fact the dust content follows the metal content gives fresh support to the idea that dla systems are originated in galaxies : dust would be produced in the diffuse medium following the injection of metals from the stellar component .",
    "the constancy of the @xmath96 ratio has important implications in the framework of the model of cosmic chemical evolution developed by pei & fall ( 1995 ) .",
    "in fact , in that model _ it is assumed _ that the dust - to - metals ratio is constant in dla absorbers . our study _ shows _ that this basic assumption of the model is essentially correct .",
    "the range of redshifts investigated here is probably insufficient to detect variations of the dust - to - metals content that may be expected in the course of the cosmic evolution .",
    "it is worth noting that the constancy of the dust - to - metals ratio could have been predicted from the remarkably small scatter of the abundances measured in different dla systems .",
    "in fact , each one of the ratios [ si / fe ] , [ cr / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] from the compilation by lu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) has dispersion @xmath100 0.2 dex , the most remarkable case being [ si / fe ] with @xmath101 = 0.11 dex in 12 dla systems .",
    "the compilation of [ zn / cr ] data by pettini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) gives @xmath101 = 0.18 dex for 14 systems . within the typical measurement error the observed abundances in the gas phase are essentially constant",
    "this remarkable result can not be explained only by assuming that dla systems have equal intrinsic abundances and equal dust grains properties . even in this case the fractions in dust , and therefore also the observed abundances , are expected to depend on the dust - to - metals ratio , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( 9 ) . since metallicity and dust content can significantly vary among dla systems , the only way to explain",
    "the constancy of the observed abundances is that @xmath102 is roughly constant in different absorbers , as we indeed find .",
    "taken at face values , the positive [ si / fe ] and [ s / fe ] ratios and the negative [ mn / fe ] ratios observed in dla systems suggest an abundance pattern similar to that found in the galactic halo ( lu et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , this interpretation requires that dust is completely absent from the absorbers and is unable to explain why the iron - peak ratios [ zn / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] are different from zero .",
    "this inconsistency , together with the agreement between direct and indirect estimates of the dust - to - gas ratios discussed in section 4.3 , suggests that any interpretation of the observed abundances must take into account the presence of dust .    in principle",
    ", the dust in dla absorbers could differ from the dust in the galaxy and an overall halo - like abundance pattern could be hidden by the peculiar properties of the dust .",
    "( 9 ) shows that one can obtain a halo - like pattern from the observed quantities by playing with the chemical composition of the dust .",
    "nevertheless , since the condition @xmath103 must be satisfied , one will be also obliged to play with other parameters , such as @xmath24 , in order to obtain meaningful results ( it is possible to see that this is in fact the case for mn ) .",
    "therefore , only by invoking a set of ad hoc requirements on the chemical composition and on the extinction properties of the dust grains is it possible to argue that the intrinsic abundances follow a halo - like pattern .",
    "by contrast , _ the results shown in fig .",
    "1 have been derived without any fine tuning of the input parameters _ ,",
    "i.e. the galactic fractions in dust , _ which are known from galactic interstellar studies_.    our results indicate that all the dla systems for which good quality abundance determinations are available show an elemental abundance pattern approximately solar , within at most @xmath2 dex ( see however the comments on nitrogen in section 4.2 ) .",
    "the absorbers included in this sample span a wide range of metallicities ( @xmath104 ) and redshifts ( @xmath105 ) . even if table 4 includes only 5 [ si / fe ] determinations , the remarkably similar [ si / fe ] values reported by lu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in other systems without zn measurement , together with the approximately constant dust - to - metals ratio ( section 5 ) suggest that the lack of [ @xmath0/fe ] enhancement is common to all the 12 absorbers with observed [ si / fe ] ratio .",
    "similarly , the mild [ mn / fe ] underabundance ( @xmath106 dex ) is probably present in all the 10 systems for which measurements are available and not only in the 2 systems shown in table 4 .",
    "future measurements for a statistically significant number of systems are required to see how general the solar - like ratios are . as mentioned in section 4.2 , nitrogen observations",
    "do show deviations from solar relative abundances .",
    "in addition , dla systems with intrinsically enhanced [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios might be hidden by selection effects .",
    "for instance , damped absorbers with high dust content could systematically obscure the background qso ( pei & fall 1995 ) and this fact could affect the probability of detecting cases with enhanced [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios .",
    "similarities between properties observed in dla absorbers and in gas rich dwarf galaxies , including the presence of large amounts of gas , the low level of metallicity , and the complexity of the line profiles had already been pointed out by york et al .",
    "pettini , boksenberg & hunstead ( 1990 ) noted , in addition , a similarity in the star formation rate and suggested that dla absorbers might arise predominantly in dwarf galaxies whose properties have not changed significantly from @xmath107 to the present epoch . according to tyson ( 1988 ) the frequency of detection of dla absorbers",
    "can be naturally explained by dwarf galaxies with no need to invoke extremely large hi diameters for the progenitors of present - day spirals .",
    "recent studies of the luminosity function of galaxies based on deep field observations ( campos 1997 ; zucca et al .",
    "1997 ) indicate a steepening of the faint end of the luminosity function consistent with that suggested by tyson ( 1988 ) .",
    "in addition to the above arguments we note here that ( i ) the general lack of detection of molecules in dla absorbers ( see levshakov et al .",
    "1992 and refs .",
    "therein ) is consistent with the low molecular content apparently typical of dwarf galaxies ( israel , tacconi & baas 1995 ) ; ( ii ) the lack of the extinction bump at @xmath72 2175   in dla absorbers ( pei , fall , & bechtold 1991 ) is characteristic of the extinction curves of the magellanic clouds .",
    "finally , we note that the high fraction of metal - poor stars predicted for the descendant of dla absorbers by lanzetta , wolfe & turnshek ( 1995 ) is consistent with most dla absorbers being metal - poor dwarf galaxies .",
    "the high fraction of metal - poor stars predicted by the model of lanzetta , wolfe & turnshek ( 1995 ) is not seen in the milky way and this inconsistency is known as the `` cosmic g - dwarf problem '' . to solve this problem",
    "it has been suggested that a large fraction of the gas in dla absorbers is consumed in forming stars in galactic bulges and spheroids rather than in galactic disks . however , this explanation conflicts with the low mass fraction of the halo and of the bulge ( bahcall & soneira 1980 ; rich 1992 ) relative to the total mass of the milky way , and is not supported by the range of abundances recently found in the galactic bulge ( rich 1992 ) .",
    "if dla absorbers are predominantly dwarf galaxies , then there is no `` cosmic g - dwarf problem '' because the stars of the descendant of dla absorbers do have low metallicities .",
    "we discuss now the observational evidences concerning the nature of dla galaxies related to the results of the present work .",
    "the present results suggest that dla galaxies commonly show a nearly solar [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio at a low level of metallicity .",
    "this property _ does not show evolution _ over a wide range of metallicities ( @xmath104 ) and redshifts ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the lack of evolution up to high levels of metallicity might suggest that the population of absorbers is essentially unevolved to the present time .",
    "this possibility , however , can only be investigated by studying a sample of low redshift dla absorbers .    the nearly solar [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios do not support an origin _ in spirals like the milky way , where the enhancement of the _ [ @xmath0/fe ] _ ratio is found not only in halo stars _ ( ryan et al . 1996 ) , _ but also in metal - poor stars of the disk _ ( edvardsson et al .",
    "it is unlikely therefore that dla absorbers arise in massive protogalactic disks .",
    "galaxies with low metallicities and without [ @xmath0/fe ] enhancement are known to exist , as demonstrated for instance by abundance studies of the magellanic clouds ( wheeler , sneden & truran 1989 ; p. 315 ) .",
    "models of chemical evolution developed to explain the elemental abundances observed in blue compact and dwarf irregular galaxies show that it is possible to obtain low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios at low metallicities when many episodes of star formation and differential galactic winds are assumed ( marconi , matteucci & tosi 1994 ) .",
    "similar models have been applied to explain the abundances observed in some dla systems ( matteucci , molaro & vladilo 1997 ) .      from a recent analysis pettini et al .",

( 1997b ) are unchanged .",
    "the dust - to - metals ratios of dla absorbers are systematically lower than in the milky way ( section 4.1 ) , even at metallicities comparable to that attained by the galactic disk .",
    "similarly low dust - to - metals ratios are instead found in the magellanic clouds .",
    "this can be seen by combining the typical metallicities of the lmc and smc , [ fe / h ] = @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively ( wheeler , sneden & truran 1989 ; p. 315 ) , with their typical gas - to - dust ratios , @xmath20/e(b - v ) @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xmath4 mag@xmath112 , respectively ( lequex 1989 ) .",

    "the magellanic ratios follow remarkably well the behaviour typical of dla systems , as we show in fig . 2 , and this is consistent again with an origin of dla absorbers in dwarf galaxies .",
    "this result is at variance with the claim by roth & blades ( 1997 ) that the magellanic dust - to - metals ratios are closer to milky way rather than to dla values .",
    "the claim is based on three measurements of the magellanic [ cr / zn ] ratio , two of which are in fact consistent , within the error bars , with dla values .",
    "the third measurement , towards sk @xmath11573 , gives a [ cr / zn ] ratio lower than in dla systems , but in this case the magellanic znii and crii column densities are exceptionally high , not only compared to the other two magellanic lines of sight , but even compared to the 20 galactic lines of sight observed with the hst ghrs ( roth & blades 1995 ) .",
    "the lmc path toward sk @xmath11573 is clearly atypical and might hide an exceptional amount of dust .",

    "such relatively high velocity widths could be due to the presence of flows or systematic motions superposed to the low rotation pattern of dwarf galaxies ( see e.g. sahu & blades 1997 ) .",

    ", it is important to understand whether the low fraction of identified spirals is real or , instead , is due to some selection effect or to a peculiar dust composition that would alter the conclusions of the present work .",
    "if the fraction of spirals will be confirmed to be low , a mass of dla galaxies lower than expected for proto - spirals objects would help to reconcile cold plus hot dark matter ( chdm ) cosmology with observed properties of high redshift absorbers ( see klypin at al .",

    "<S> the effects of the dust on the determination of elemental abundances in damped ly @xmath0 ( dla ) absorbers are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> relations between the observed abundances measured in the gas phase and the overall abundances ( gas plus dust ) are derived as a function of dust - to - gas ratio , metallicity , element - to - element abundance pattern , average extinction coefficient of dust grains , and chemical composition of dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> a method is presented for determining dust - to - gas ratios , dust - to - metals ratios , and dust - corrected relative abundances in dla absorbers by assuming dust of galactic type and constant abundance ratios between iron - peak elements . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied to a sample of 17 dla absorbers with available zn , cr and/or fe measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dust - to - gas ratios are mostly distributed between 2% and 25% of the galactic value , in good quantitative agreement with the results from reddening studies of qsos with foreground dla absorption . </S>",
    "<S> a correlation is found between dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity in dla galaxies , with a typical dust - to - metals ratio of @xmath1 60% the galactic value . </S>",
    "<S> the derived dust - to - metals ratios are then used to correct from the effects of dust the abundance ratios [ si / fe ] , [ s / fe ] , [ ti / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] , [ ni / fe ] available for a sub - sample of 9 absorbers . </S>",
    "<S> the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios corrected from dust do not show the enhancement characteristic of metal - poor galactic stars , but instead have essentially solar values , within @xmath2 dex . </S>",
