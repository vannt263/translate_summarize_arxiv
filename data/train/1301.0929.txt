    "evolutionary algorithms are a type of general problem solvers that can be applied to many difficult optimization problems . because of their generality , these algorithms act similarly like swiss army knife @xcite that is a handy set of tools that can be used to address a variety of tasks . in general ,",
    "a definite task can be performed better with an associated special tool . however , in the absence of this tool , the swiss army knife may be more suitable as a substitute .",
    "for example , to cut a piece of bread the kitchen knife is more suitable , but when traveling the swiss army knife is fine .    similarly , when a problem to be solved from a domain where the problem - specific knowledge is absent evolutionary algorithms can be successfully applied .",
    "evolutionary algorithms are easy to implement and often provide adequate solutions .",
    "an origin of these algorithms is found in the darwian principles of natural selection @xcite . in accordance with these principles",
    ", only the fittest individuals can survive in the struggle for existence and reproduce their good characteristics into next generation .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pic:1 ] , evolutionary algorithms operate with the population of solutions . at first , the solution needs to be defined within an evolutionary algorithm .",
    "usually , this definition can not be described in the original problem context directly .",
    "in contrast , the solution is defined by data structures that describe the original problem context indirectly and thus , determine the search space within an evolutionary search ( optimization process ) .",
    "there exists the analogy in the nature , where the genotype encodes the phenotype , as well .",
    "consequently , a genotype - phenotype mapping determines how the genotypic representation is mapped to the phenotypic property . in other words ,",
    "the phenotypic property determines the solution in original problem context .",
    "before an evolutionary process actually starts , the initial population needs to be generated .",
    "the initial population is generated most often randomly .",
    "a basis of an evolutionary algorithm represents an evolutionary search in which the selected solutions undergo an operation of reproduction , i.e. , a crossover and a mutation . as a result , new candidate solutions ( offsprings )",
    "are produced that compete , according to their fitness , with old ones for a place in the next generation .",
    "the fitness is evaluated by an evaluation function ( also called fitness function ) that defines requirements of the optimization ( minimization or maximization of the fitness function ) . in this study ,",
    "the minimization of the fitness function is considered . as the population evolves solutions becomes fitter and fitter .",
    "finally , the evolutionary search can be iterated until a solution with sufficient quality ( fitness ) is found or the predefined number of generations is reached @xcite .",
    "note that some steps in fig .",
    "[ pic:1 ] can be omitted ( e.g. , mutation , survivor selection ) .",
    "an evolutionary search is categorized by two terms : exploration and exploitation .",
    "the former term is connected with a discovering of the new solutions , while the later with a search in the vicinity of knowing good solutions @xcite .",
    "both terms , however , interweave each other in the evolutionary search . the evolutionary search acts correctly when a sufficient diversity of population is present .",
    "the population diversity can be measured differently : the number of different fitness values , the number of different genotypes , the number of different phenotypes , entropy , etc .",
    "the higher the population diversity , the better exploration can be expected .",
    "losing of population diversity can lead to the premature convergence .",
    "exploration and exploitation of evolutionary algorithms are controlled by the control parameters , for instance the population size , the probability of mutation @xmath0 , the probability of crossover @xmath1 , and the tournament size . to avoid a wrong setting of these",
    ", the control parameters can be embedded into the genotype of individuals together with problem variables and undergo through evolutionary operations .",
    "this idea is exploited by a self - adaptation .",
    "the performance of a self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm depends on the characteristics of population distribution that directs the evolutionary search towards appropriate regions of the search space @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , widened the notion of self - adaptation with a generalized concept of self - adaptation .",
    "this concept relies on the neutral theory of molecular evolution @xcite .",
    "regarding this theory , the most mutations on molecular level are selection neutral and therefore , can not have any impact on fitness of individual . consequently ,",
    "the major part of evolutionary changes are not result of natural selection but result of random genetic drift that acts on neutral allele .",
    "an neutral allele is one or more forms of a particular gene that has no impact on fitness of individual @xcite .",
    "in contrast to natural selection , the random genetic drift is a whole stochastic process that is caused by sampling error and affects the frequency of mutated allele . on basis of this theory igel and toussaint",
    "ascertain that the neutral genotype - phenotype mapping is not injective .",
    "that is , more genotypes can be mapped into the same phenotype . by self - adaptation , a neutral part of genotype ( problem variables ) that determines the phenotype enables discovering the search space independent of the phenotypic variations . on the other hand ,",
    "the rest part of genotype ( control parameters ) determines the strategy of discovering the search space and therefore , influences the exploration distribution .",
    "although evolutionary algorithms can be applied to many real - world optimization problems their performance is still subject of the no free lunch ( nfl ) theorem @xcite . according to this theorem",
    "any two algorithms are equivalent , when their performance is compared across all possible problems .",
    "fortunately , the nfl theorem can be circumvented for a given problem by a hybridization that incorporates the problem specific knowledge into evolutionary algorithms .        in fig .",
    "2 some possibilities to hybridize evolutionary algorithms are illustrated . at first",
    ", the initial population can be generated by incorporating solutions of existing algorithms or by using heuristics , local search , etc .",
    "in addition , the local search can be applied to the population of offsprings .",
    "actually , the evolutionary algorithm hybridized with local search is called a memetic algorithm as well @xcite .",
    "evolutionary operators ( mutation , crossover , parent and survivor selection ) can incorporate problem - specific knowledge or apply the operators from other algorithms .",
    "finally , a fitness function offers the most possibilities for a hybridization because it can be used as decoder that decodes the indirect represented genotype into feasible solution . by this mapping , however , the problem specific knowledge or known heuristics can be incorporated to the problem solver .    in this chapter the hybrid self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm ( hsa - ea ) is presented that is hybridized with :    * construction heuristic , * local search , * neutral survivor selection , and * heuristic initialization procedure .",
    "this algorithm acts as meta - heuristic , where the down - level evolutionary algorithm is used as generator of new solutions , while for the upper - level construction of the solutions a traditional heuristic is applied .",
    "this construction heuristic represents the hybridization of evaluation function .",
    "each generated solution is improved by the local search heuristics .",
    "this evolutionary algorithm supports an existence of neutral solutions , i.e. , solutions with equal values of a fitness function but different genotype representation .",
    "such solutions can be arisen often in matured generations of evolutionary process and are subject of neutral survivor selection .",
    "this selection operator models oneself upon a neutral theory of molecular evolution @xcite and tries to direct the evolutionary search to new , undiscovered regions of search space .",
    "in fact , the neutral survivor selection represents hybridization of evolutionary operators , in this case , the survivor selection operator .",
    "the hybrid self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm can be used especially for solving of the hardest combinatorial optimization problems @xcite .",
    "the chapter is further organized as follows . in the sect .",
    "2 the self - adaptation in evolutionary algorithms is discussed . there , the connection between neutrality and self - adaptation is explained .",
    "3 describes hybridization elements of the self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm .",
    "4 introduces the implementations of hybrid self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm for graph 3-coloring in details .",
    "performances of this algorithm are substantiated with extensive collection of results .",
    "the chapter is concluded with summarization of the performed work and announcement of the possibilities for the further work .",
    "optimization is a dynamical process , therefore , the values of parameters that are set at initialization become worse through the run .",
    "the necessity to adapt control parameters during the runs of evolutionary algorithms born an idea of self - adaptation @xcite , where some control parameters are embedded into genotype .",
    "this genotype undergoes effects of variation operators .",
    "mostly , with the notion of self - adaptation evolutionary strategies @xcite are connected that are used for solving continuous optimization problems .",
    "typically , the problem variables in evolutionary strategies are represented as real - coded vector @xmath2 that are embedded into genotype together with control parameters ( mostly mutation parameters ) .",
    "these parameters determine mutation strengths @xmath3 that must be greater than zero .",
    "usually , the mutation strengths are assigned to each problem variable . in that case , the uncorrelated mutation with @xmath4 step sizes is obtained @xcite . here , the candidate solution is represented as @xmath5 .",
    "the mutation is now specified as follows : @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the learning rates . to keep the mutation strengths @xmath10 greater than zero",
    ", the following rule is used @xmath11 frequently , a crossover operator is used in the self - adaptive evolutionary strategies .",
    "this operator from two parents forms one offsprings .",
    "typically , a discrete and arithmetic crossover is used .",
    "the former , from among the values of two parents @xmath12 and @xmath13 that are located on @xmath14-th position , selects the value of offspring @xmath15 randomly .",
    "the later calculates the value of offspring @xmath15 from the values of two parents @xmath12 and @xmath13 that are located on @xmath14-th position according to the following equation : @xmath16 where parameter @xmath17 captures the values from interval @xmath18 $ ] . in the case of @xmath19 ,",
    "the uniform arithmetic crossover is obtained .",
    "the potential benefits of neutrality was subject of many researches in the biological science @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the growing interest for the usage of this knowledge in evolutionary computation was raised @xcite . @xcite",
    "dealt with the non - injectivity of genotype - phenotype mapping that is the main characteristic of this mapping .",
    "that is , more genotypes can be mapped to the same phenotype .",
    "@xcite pointed out that in the absence of an external control and with a constant genotype - phenotype mapping only neutral genetic variations can allow an adaptation of exploration distribution without changing the phenotypes in the population .",
    "however , the neutral genetic variations act on the genotype of parent but does not influence on the phenotype of offspring .    as a result ,",
    "control parameters in evolutionary strategies represent a search strategy .",
    "the change of this strategy enables a discovery of new regions of the search space .",
    "the genotype , therefore , does not include only the information addressing its phenotype but the information about further discovering of the search space as well . in summary ,",
    "the neutrality is not necessary redundant but it is prerequisite for self - adaptation .",
    "this concept is called the general concept of self - adaptation as well @xcite .",
    "evolutionary algorithms are a generic tool that can be used for solving many hard optimization problems . however , the solving of that problems showed that evolutionary algorithms are too problem - independent .",
    "therefore , there are hybridized with several techniques and heuristics that are capable to incorporate problem - specific knowledge .",
    "@xcite identified mostly used hybrid architectures today as follows :    * hybridization between two evolutionary algorithms @xcite , * neural network assisted evolutionary algorithm @xcite , * fuzzy logic assisted evolutionary algorithm @xcite , * particle swarm optimization assisted evolutionary algorithm @xcite , * ant colony optimization assisted evolutionary algorithm @xcite , * bacterial foraging optimization assisted evolutionary algorithm @xcite , * hybridization between an evolutionary algorithm and other heuristics , like local search @xcite , tabu search @xcite , simulated annealing @xcite , hill climbing @xcite , dynamic programming @xcite , etc .    in general , successfully implementation of evolutionary algorithms for solving a given problem depends on incorporated problem - specific knowledge .",
    "as already mentioned before , all elements of evolutionary algorithms can be hybridized .",
    "mostly , a hybridization addresses the following elements of evolutionary algorithms @xcite :    * initial population , * genotype - phenotype mapping , * evaluation function , and * variation and selection operators .",
    "first , problem - specific knowledge incorporated into heuristic procedures can be used for creating an initial population .",
    "second , genotype - phenotype mapping is used by evolutionary algorithms , where the solutions are represented in an indirect way . in that cases ,",
    "a constructing algorithm that maps the genotype representation into a corresponding phenotypic solution needs to be applied .",
    "this constructor can incorporate various heuristic or other problem - specific knowledge .",
    "third , to improve the current solutions by an evaluation function , local search heuristics can be used .",
    "finally , problem - specific knowledge can be exploited by heuristic variation and selection operators .",
    "the mentioned hybridizations can be used to hybridize the self - adaptive evolutionary algorithms as well . in the rest of chapter ,",
    "we propose three kinds of hybridizations that was employed to the proposed hybrid self - adaptive evolutionary algorithms :    * the construction heuristics that can be used by the genotype - phenotype mapping , * the local search heuristics that can be used by the evaluation function , and * the neutral survivor selection that incorporates the problem - specific knowledge .    because the initialization of initial population is problem dependent",
    "we omit it from our discussion .",
    "usually , evolutionary algorithms are used for problem solving , where a lot of experience and knowledge is accumulated in various heuristic algorithms . typically , these algorithms work well on limited number of problems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "evolutionary algorithms are a general method suitable to solve very different kinds of problems . in general , these algorithms are less efficient than heuristics specialized to solve the given problem . if we want to combine a benefit of both kind of algorithms then the evolutionary algorithm can be used for discovering new solutions that the heuristic exploits for building of new , probably better solutions .",
    "construction heuristics build the solution of optimization problem incrementally , i.e. , elements are added to a solution step by step ( algorithm  [ alg : const ] ) .",
    "@xmath20 ;      a local search belongs to a class of improvement heuristics @xcite . in our case ,",
    "main characteristic of these is that the current solution is taken and improved as long as improvements are perceived .",
    "the local search is an iterative process of discovering points in the vicinity of current solution .",
    "if a better solution is found the current solution is replaced by it .",
    "a neighborhood of the current solution @xmath21 is defined as a set of solutions that can be reached using an unary operator @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "in fact , each neighbor @xmath23 in neighborhood @xmath24 can be reached from current solution @xmath21 in @xmath25 strokes .",
    "therefore , this neighborhood is called @xmath26 neighborhood of current solution @xmath21 as well . for example , let the binary represented solution @xmath21 and @xmath27 operator on it are given . in that case , each of neighbors @xmath28 can be reached changing exactly one bit .",
    "the neighborhood of this operator is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes a hamming distance of two binary vectors as follows @xmath31 where operator @xmath32 means @xmath33 operation .",
    "essentially , the hamming distance in equation  [ eq : hamming ] is calculated by counting the number of different bits between vectors @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath27 operator defines the set of feasible @xmath27 strokes while the number of feasible @xmath27 strokes determines the size of neighborhood .",
    "@xmath34 ; @xmath35 ; @xmath36 ;    as illustrated by algorithm  [ alg : ls ] , the local search can be described as follows @xcite :    * the initial solution is generated that becomes the current solution ( procedure @xmath37 ) . *",
    "the current solution is transformed with @xmath26 strokes and the given solution @xmath23 is evaluated ( procedure @xmath38 ) . *",
    "if the new solution @xmath23 is better than the current @xmath21 the current solution is replaced .",
    "on the other hand , the current solution is kept .",
    "* lines 2 to 7 are repeated until the set of neighbors is not empty ( procedure @xmath39 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the @xmath26 operator represents a basic element of the local search from which depends how exhaustive the neighborhood will be discovered .",
    "therefore , the problem - specific knowledge needs to be incorporated by building of the efficient operator .",
    "a genotype diversity is one of main prerequisites for the efficient self - adaptation .",
    "the smaller genotypic diversity causes that the population is crowded in the search space . as a result",
    ", the search space is exploited . on the other hand",
    ", the larger genotypic diversity causes that the population is more distributed within the search space and therefore , the search space is explored @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the genotype diversity of population is maintained with a proposed neutral survivor selection that is inspired by the neutral theory of molecular evolution @xcite , where the neutral mutation determines to the individual three possible destinies , as follows :    * the fittest individual can survive in the struggle for existence , * the less fitter individual is eliminated by the natural selection , * individual with the same fitness undergo an operation of genetic drift , where its survivor is dependent on a chance .",
    "each candidate solution represents a point in the search space .",
    "if the fitness value is assigned to each feasible solution then these form a fitness landscape that consists of peeks , valleys and plateaus @xcite .",
    "in fact , the peaks in the fitness landscape represents points with higher fitness , the valleys points with the lower fitness while plateaus denotes regions , where the solutions are neutral @xcite .",
    "the concept of the fitness landscape plays an important role in evolutionary computation as well .",
    "moreover , with its help behavior of evolutionary algorithms by solving the optimization problem can be understood .",
    "if on the search space we look from a standpoint of fitness landscape then the heuristical algorithm tries to navigate through this landscape with aim to discover the highest peeks in the landscape @xcite .",
    "however , to determine how distant one solution is from the other , some measure is needed .",
    "which measure to use depends on a given problem . in the case of genetic algorithms , where we deal with the binary solutions , the hamming distance ( equation  [ eq : hamming ] ) can be used .",
    "when the solutions are represented as real - coded vectors an euclidian distance is more appropriate .",
    "the euclidian distance between two vectors @xmath40 and @xmath21 is expressed as follows : @xmath41 and measures the root of quadrat differences between elements of vectors @xmath40 and @xmath21 .",
    "the main characteristics of fitness landscapes that have a great impact on the evolutionary search are the following @xcite :    * the fitness differences between neighboring points in the fitness landscape : to determine a ruggedness of the landscape , i.e. , more rugged as the landscape , more difficultly the optimal solution can be found ; * the number of peaks ( local optima ) in the landscape : the higher the number of peaks , the more difficulty the evolutionary algorithms can direct the search to the optimal solution ; * how the local optima are distributed in the search space : to determine the distribution of the peeks in the fitness landscape ; * how the topology of the basins of attraction influences on the exit from the local optima : to determine how difficult the evolutionary search that gets stuck into local optima can find the exit from it and continue with the discovering of the search space ; * existence of the neutral networks : the solutions with the equal value of fitness represent a plateaus in the fitness landscape .    when the stochastic fitness function is used for evaluation of individuals the fitness landscape is changed over time .",
    "in this way , the dynamic landscape is obtained , where the concept of fitness landscape can be applied , first of all , to analyze the neutral networks that arise , typically , in the matured generations .",
    "to determine , how the solutions are dissipated over the search space some reference point is needed .",
    "for this reason , the current best solution @xmath42 in the population is used .",
    "this is added to the population of @xmath43 solutions .",
    "an operation of the neutral survivor selection is divided into two phases . in the first phase ,",
    "the evolutionary algorithm from the population of @xmath44 offsprings finds a set of neutral solutions @xmath45 that represents the best solutions in the population of offsprings .",
    "if the neutral solutions are better than or equal to the reference , i.e. @xmath46 for @xmath47 , then reference solution @xmath42 is replaced with the neutral solution @xmath48 that is the most faraway from reference solution according to the equation 7 .",
    "thereby , it is expected that the evolutionary search is directed to the new , undiscovered region of the search space . in the second phase , the updated reference solution @xmath42 is used to determine the next population of survivors .",
    "therefore , all offsprings are ordered with regard to the ordering relation @xmath49 ( read : is better than ) as follows : @xmath50    where the ordering relation @xmath49 is defined as    @xmath51    finally , for the next generation the evolutionary algorithm selects the best @xmath43 offsprings according to the equation  [ eq : order ] .",
    "these individuals capture the random positions in the next generation . likewise",
    "the neutral theory of molecular evolution , the neutral survivor selection offers to the offsprings three possible outcomes , as follows .",
    "the best offsprings survive .",
    "additionally , the offspring from the set of neutral solutions that is far away of reference solution can become the new reference solution .",
    "the less fitter offsprings are usually eliminated from the population .",
    "all other solutions , that can be neutral as well , can survive if they are ordered on the first @xmath43 positions regarding to equation  [ eq : order ] .",
    "in this section an implementation of the hybrid self - adaptive evolutionary algorithms ( hsa - ea ) for solving combinatorial optimization problems is represented .",
    "the implementation of this algorithm in practice consists of the following phases :    * finding the best heuristic that solves the problem on a traditional way and adapting it to use by the self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm , * defining the other elements of the self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm , * defining the suitable local search heuristics , and * including the neutral survivor selection .",
    "the main idea behind use of the construction heuristics in the hsa - ea is to exploit the knowledge accumulated in existing heuristics .",
    "moreover , this knowledge is embedded into the evolutionary algorithm that is capable to discover the new solutions . to work simultaneously",
    "both algorithms need to operate with the same representation of solutions .",
    "if this is not a case a decoder can be used .",
    "the solutions are encoded by the evolutionary algorithm as the real - coded vectors and decoded before the construction of solutions .",
    "the whole task is performed in genotype - phenotype mapping that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pic:3 ] .",
    "the genotype - phenotype mapping consists of two phases as follows :    * decoding , * constructing .",
    "evolutionary algorithms operate in genotypic search space , where each genotype consists of real - coded problem variables and control parameters . for encoded solution",
    "only the problem variables are taken .",
    "this solution is further decoded by decoder into a decoded solution that is appropriate for handling of a construction heuristic .",
    "finally , the construction heuristic constructs the solution within the original problem context , i.e. , problem solution space .",
    "this solution is evaluated by the suitable evaluation function .",
    "the other elements of self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm consists of :    * evaluation function , * population model , * parent selection mechanism , * variation operators ( mutation and crossover ) , and * initialization procedure and termination condition .",
    "the evaluation function depends on a given problem .",
    "the self - adaptive evolutionary algorithm uses the population model @xmath52 , where the @xmath44 offsprings is generated from the @xmath43 parents .",
    "however , the parents that are selected with tournament selection @xcite are replaced by the @xmath43 the best offsprings according to the appropriate population model .",
    "the ratio @xmath53 is used for the efficient self - adaptation @xcite .",
    "typically , the normal uncorrelated mutation with @xmath4 step sizes , discrete and arithmetic crossover are used by the hsa - ea .",
    "normally , the probabilities of mutation and crossover are set according to the given problem .",
    "selection of the suitable local search heuristics that improve the current solution is a crucial for the performance of the hsa - ea . on the other hand ,",
    "the implementation of neutral survivor selection is straightforward .",
    "finally , the scheme of the hsa - ea is represented in the algorithm  [ alg : hsa - ea ] .",
    "@xmath54 ; @xmath55 ; @xmath56 ; @xmath57 ; @xmath58 ; @xmath59 ; @xmath60 ; @xmath61 ;    in the rest of the chapter we present the implementation of the hsa - ea for the graph 3-coloring .",
    "this algorithm is hybridized with the dsatur @xcite construction heuristic that is well - known traditional heuristic for the graph 3-coloring .",
    "graph 3-coloring can be informally defined as follows .",
    "let assume , an undirected graph @xmath62 is given , where @xmath63 denotes a finite set of vertices and @xmath64 a finite set of unordered pairs of vertices named edges @xcite .",
    "the vertices of graph @xmath65 have to be colored with three colors such that no one of vertices connected with an edge is not colored with the same color .",
    "graph 3-coloring can be formalized as constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) that is denoted as a pair @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes a free search space and @xmath68 a boolean function on @xmath67 .",
    "the free search space denotes the domain of candidate solutions @xmath69 and does not contain any constraints , i.e. , each candidate solution is feasible .",
    "the function @xmath68 divides the search space @xmath67 into feasible and unfeasible regions .",
    "the solution of constraint satisfaction problem is found when all constraints are satisfied , i.e. , when @xmath70 .    however , for the 3-coloring of graph @xmath62 the free search space @xmath67 consists of all permutations of vertices @xmath71 for @xmath72 . on the other hand , the function @xmath68 ( also feasibility condition ) is composed of constraints on vertices .",
    "that is , for each vertex @xmath71 the corresponding constraint @xmath73 is defined as the set of constraints involving vertex @xmath74 , i.e. , edges @xmath75 for @xmath76 connecting to vertex @xmath74 .",
    "the feasibility condition is expressed as conjunction of all constraints @xmath77 .",
    "handling direct constraints in evolutionary algorithms is not straightforward . to overcome this problem ,",
    "the constraint satisfaction problems are , typically , transformed into unconstrained ( also free optimization problem ) by the sense of a penalty function .",
    "the more an infeasible solution is far away from feasible region , the higher is the penalty .",
    "moreover , this penalty function can act as an evaluation function by the evolutionary algorithm . for graph 3-coloring",
    "it can be expressed as    @xmath78    where the function @xmath79 is defined as    @xmath80    note that all constraints in solution @xmath69 are satisfied , i.e. , @xmath81 if and only if @xmath82 . in this way , the equation  [ eq : fit ] represents the feasibility condition and can be used to estimate the quality of solution @xmath69 in the permutation search space .",

    "characteristics of the hsa - ea used in experiments were as follows .",
    "the normal distributed mutation was employed and applied with mutation probability of 1.0 .",
    "the crossover was not used .",
    "the tournament selection with size 3 selects the parents for mutation .",
    "the population model @xmath109 was suitable for the self - adaptation because the ratio between parents and generated offspring amounted to @xmath110 as recommended by @xcite .",
    "as termination condition , the maximum number of evaluations to solution was used .",
    "fortunately , the average number of evaluations to solution ( @xmath111 ) that counts the number of evaluation function calls was employed as the performance measure of efficiency .",
    "in addition , the average number of uncolored nodes ( @xmath112 ) was employed as the performance measure of solution quality .",
    "this measure was applied when the hsa - ea does not find the solution and counts the number of uncolored vertices .",
    "nevertheless , the success rate ( @xmath113 ) was defined as the primary performance measure and expressed as the ratio between the runs in which the solution was found and all performed runs .",
    "the @xcite random graph generator was employed for generation of random graphs that constituted the test suite .",
    "it is capable to generate the graphs of various types , number of vertices , edge densities and seeds of random generator . in this study we concentrated on the equi - partite type of graphs .",
    "this type of graphs is not the most difficult to color but difficult enough for many existing algorithms @xcite .",
    "the random graph generator divides the vertices of graph into three color sets before generating randomly . in sense of equi - partite random graph , these color sets are as close in size as possible .",

    "when @xmath115 is increased the number of edges raised and the graph becomes interconnected . as a result , the number of constraints that needs to be satisfied by the coloring algorithm increases until suddenly the graph becomes uncolorable .",
    "this occurrence depends on a ratio between the number of edges and the number of vertices .",
    "the ratio is referred to as the threshold @xcite .",
    "that is , in the vicinity of the threshold the vertices of the random generated graph becomes hard to color or even the graph becomes uncolorable .",
    "fortunately , the graph instances with this ratio much higher that the threshold are easy to color because these graphs are densely interconnected .",
    "therefore , many global optima exist in the search space that can be discovered easy by many graph 3-coloring algorithms .",

    "conversely , the average fitness values are changed by the hsa - ea in the situations where the best values are not found as well .",
