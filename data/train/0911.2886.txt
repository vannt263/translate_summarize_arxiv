    "quantum dots fabricated within carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have attracted considerable attention in recent years ( for reviews see _ e.g. _  [ ] ) . such devices , in which electrons are trapped within a small , strongly interacting region of the cnt by an applied electric field , show remarkable electronic transport properties@xcite and may have useful applications in future technology.@xcite    cnt - based devices are of particular interest due to their doubly - degenerate orbital structure which , combined with electron spin , generates a wealth of basic physics .",
    "one such phenomenon is the kondo effect,@xcite resulting from strong electron interactions within the dot .",
    "it is observed@xcite when the device is tuned so that the dot has a partially - filled shell of electrons : on lowering the temperature , the dot s spin / orbital degrees of freedom become strongly coupled@xcite to those of the leads , leading to a complex many - body ground state with an enhanced electronic conductance.@xcite understanding this effect is particularly important for cnt dots , because the involvement of both spin and orbital degrees of freedom generates an @xmath0 kondo effect that persists to considerably higher temperatures  up to a few kelvin ( _ i.e. _  a few tenths of an @xmath2 )  than the standard @xmath1 kondo effect in semiconductor devices.@xcite using a range of many - body techniques , the theory of the @xmath0 kondo effect is now well established@xcite and _ e.g. _  has been shown@xcite to be in good agreement with experiments@xcite performed in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "another consequence of the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in cnt devices is spin - orbit ( so ) coupling .",
    "its existence was beautifully demonstrated in experiments@xcite on a very strongly correlated cnt dot , where it generates a splitting of sequential tunneling spectra at finite bias , and kinks in the magnetic field dependence of the coulomb blockade ` staircase ' at zero bias .",
    "the strength of the so coupling was measured@xcite , and for the device studied found to be of order @xmath3@xmath4 , varying somewhat between different electron shells .    comparing the typical energy scales of the kondo effect and the so coupling ,",
    "it is striking that _ both _ may arise on the energy scale of a few tenths of an @xmath2 .",
    "two related questions then arise : what effect does so coupling have on the standard @xmath0 kondo theory , and is the kondo / so competition seen experimentally ?",
    "we seek to answer these questions in this paper .",
    "aspects of spin - orbit coupling in cnts have recently been considered theoretically .",
    "the origins of the coupling itself have been determined from direct microscopic calculation,@xcite showing that while a number of distinct spin - orbit interactions arise in principle , the dominant contribution is the direct coupling between each electron s spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "the effect of this coupling on the states of the isolated dot has been analysed in detail,@xcite and the resulting sequential tunneling transport properties ( arising when the kondo scale is too small to be seen experimentally@xcite ) have been calculated and compared to experiment.@xcite aspects of the competition between spin - orbit coupling and the kondo effect have also been studied@xcite via an equation of motion decoupling scheme in the @xmath5 limit . within this",
    "rather crude approximation,@xcite the splitting of the @xmath0 kondo resonance was examined for finite so coupling and magnetic field , and an orbital kondo effect found at finite field in the two - electron coulomb blockade valley.@xcite    in the present work we consider the two - fold orbitally degenerate @xmath0 anderson impurity model ( aim ) in a magnetic field , with so coupling , and study it using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite backed up by simple physical arguments .",
    "nrg is ideally suited to the problem , being known for similar quantum impurity models to provide numerically exact results on the low - energy / temperature scales relevant to experiment .",
    "the model itself also has a strong track - record , a previous nrg study@xcite of the @xmath0 aim in the absence of a magnetic field having shown that the all - important low - energy kondo physics is well reproduced when the bare model parameters are fitted to high - energy conductance features such as the coulomb blockade diamonds .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows .",
    "the model is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , and the relevant theoretical background and nrg technique are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "the behavior of the model in the atomic ( lead - uncoupled dot ) limit is outlined in sec .  [ sec : atomic ] , from which simple arguments are then used to deduce the effect of introducing a finite spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the main body of the paper is sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , where we present and discuss the results of nrg calculations .",
    "we begin by considering the zero - bias conductance , as a function of gate voltage , temperature and magnetic field .",
    "here we make comparison to the experiments of jarillo - herrero _",
    "et al._,@xcite showing that the orbital splitting identified empirically in experiment is readily explained by the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling in the model .",
    "we then turn to a discussion of the finite - bias conductance , comparing explicitly to the experiments of makarowski _",
    "et al._@xcite and showing that the asymmetry observed in the kondo peaks at finite bias is also well - described by the theory .",
    "the paper concludes with a brief summary , and a discussion of the applicability of the pure @xmath0 aim to cnt quantum dots .",
    "the basic model used to describe a cnt quantum dot is the @xmath0 anderson impurity model@xcite , given in conventional notation by  @xcite @xmath6 the ` flavor ' index @xmath7 takes four discrete values , which @xmath0 symmetry reflects physically a combination of degenerate spin and orbital degrees of freedom : @xmath8 , with @xmath9 denoting clockwise and anticlockwise orbits along the @xmath10-direction ( major axis ) of the cnt , and @xmath11 for the @xmath10-components of electron spin .",
    "the final two terms in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : su4ham ] ) represent the isolated dot , with orbital energy @xmath12 and charging energy @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the dot capacitance ) ; where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the total dot number operator , and @xmath17 creates a @xmath18-spin electron in orbital @xmath19 .",
    "the first pair of terms describe the non - interacting conduction band ( lead ) , and tunnel coupling between the dot / lead .",
    "each is taken to be spin and orbital conserving  @xcite , reflecting physically the fact ( see _ e.g. _  [ ] ) that in clean cnt devices the leads are formed within the nanotube and so ` carry ' the orbital symmetry , which is then conserved in the tunneling process .",
    "the model represents the experimentally relevant situation in which the single - particle level spacing of the dot exceeds both the tunnel coupling to the leads and the intradot interactions.@xcite in this case the four - electron ` shells ' of the dot are filled sequentially on sweeping the gate voltage @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and , for sufficiently - low temperatures and source - drain biases , only a single shell need be considered at a time . only the direct coulomb repulsion between dot electrons is moreover included ; exchange interactions are generally weaker@xcite and are not necessary@xcite to account for the experimental results of _ e.g. _  [ ] .    to the ` standard model ' above",
    ", we add the coupling to the external magnetic field , as well as the key so coupling of interest here . for a field @xmath22 applied parallel to the nanotube axis",
    ", the zeeman coupling to the spin and orbital degrees of freedom takes the form@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the @xmath10-components of the spin and orbital - pseudospin operators for orbital @xmath19 ; and where the coupling constants are @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 the electron @xmath28-factor ) and @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 the orbital moment ) .",
    "the so interaction obtained from detailed microscopic calculations is rather complicated@xcite , but in practice only direct coupling between electron spin and the @xmath10-component of orbital angular momentum is relevant.@xcite as explained in [ ] , the so interaction is then given by    [ eq : hso ] @xmath31    with @xmath32 parametrising the strength of the so coupling ; and which simple form _",
    "e.g. _  explains in essence fully the sequential tunneling experiments of [ ] .",
    "the full hamiltonain considered is thus @xmath33 inclusion of @xmath34 lowering the symmetry from @xmath0 to @xmath35 ( such that @xmath36 commutes with the four charge operators @xmath37 ) .    finally , to connect to experiment we simply treat @xmath38 , @xmath32 and the ratio @xmath39 as parameters chosen to fit experiment ( which in practice is quite straightforward and unambiguous ) .",
    "the dot level energy @xmath12 is proportional to the experimental gate voltage , of form @xmath40 ; but in practice it is more convenient to work with a dimensionless gate voltage@xcite @xmath41 such that differences in @xmath20 are proportional to differences in @xmath42 ( with a proportionality constant determined if desired by fit to experiment ) .",
    "the dot green function @xmath43 is central to understanding transport through the dot ; which is directly related to the single - particle spectrum @xmath44 _ via _  the meir - wingreen formula  @xcite , as now briefly summarised .",
    "one first partitions the conduction band of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : su4ham ] ) into two equivalent leads , left ( @xmath45 ) and right ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "these are taken conventionally  @xcite to be flat bands of width @xmath47 , with density of states @xmath48 for @xmath49 ( and with @xmath50 by far the largest energy scale in the model ) .",
    "the tunneling matrix elements to the @xmath51 leads are taken for simplicity as @xmath52 and @xmath53 , independent of @xmath54 .",
    "the leads are fixed at different chemical potentials , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with a bias voltage @xmath57 between them , @xmath58 .",
    "after transients have subsided , the bias voltage gives rise to a steady state current through the dot , @xmath59 , carried by its four conduction channels .",
    "an exact expression for @xmath59 follows from the keldysh formalism:@xcite @xmath60 \\sum_{i,\\sigma } d_{i\\sigma}(\\omega)\\ ] ] where @xmath61 @xmath62 is the hybridization strength of the dot to lead @xmath63 ( @xmath64 or @xmath46 ) , and @xmath65^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function for the lead with inverse temperature @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath68 ( we later take @xmath69 to be the ` unit ' of energy ) , such that the relative strength of coupling to the @xmath45 and @xmath46 leads enter through the dimensionless @xmath70 ( which can be chosen according to the experimental setup under consideration ) . in the perfectly symmetric case of @xmath71 , @xmath72 is maximal , while in the extreme asymmetric case of @xmath73 ( say ) , @xmath74 .",
    "the key experimental quantity is the differential conductance , @xmath75 . in the zero - bias limit , gives an exact expression for @xmath76 in terms of the equilibrium single - particle spectrum : @xmath77 with @xmath78 , which further reduces to @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 can be calculated accurately at equilibrium using the recent fdm nrg method  @xcite .    to make connection to experiments at finite source - drain bias , note that while eqn .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) itself remains exact for finite @xmath82 , the difficulty lies in calculating @xmath81 out of equilibrium . while recent progress has been made in applying nrg to the non - equilibrium single - impurity anderson model ( see _ e.g. _  [ ] ) it is currently prohibitive to apply these techniques to the model of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : fullh ] ) .",
    "as in previous work  @xcite we thus make the standard approximation of neglecting the @xmath57-dependence of the dot self - energy . using eqn .",

    "these in turn can be obtained exactly in terms of the so - called ` excess charges ' of the dot in the four distinct conduction channels , as now sketched .",

    "( [ eq : gczerozerot ] ) we obtain @xmath101 the @xmath80 zero - bias conductance is thus related to the excess charges in the four conduction channels ( themselves readily obtained via a thermodynamic nrg calculation ) . in the experimentally relevant limit where @xmath50 is the largest energy scale ,",
    "these excess charges are moreover confined to the dot itself .",
    "one can then approximate @xmath102 by @xmath103 , thereby producing a simple relationship between the dot occupancy and its transport properties .    in the @xmath0-symmetric limit ( @xmath104 )",
    "considered previously,@xcite the excess charges are equivalent in all four channels and hence @xmath105 with @xmath106 .",

    "this technique  @xcite has long provided access to numerically - exact results for thermodynamics and , with the recent identification of its complete fock space,@xcite an equally systematic and reliable route to dynamical properties .",
    "the basic approach is detailed in _ e.g. _  [ ] . a logarithmic discretization of the conduction band states is first used to map the hamiltonian onto a countably infinite one - dimensional chain .",
    "the linear chain is diagonalised iteratively , starting from a single site and adding the others one by one .",
    "the key advantage of logarithmic discretization is that the coupling constants along the chain decrease rapidly , and the high - energy states of one iteration can be discarded without affecting the low - energy states retained in later iterations . as such , a fixed number of states can in practice be kept at each iteration , rendering the iterative diagonalization of the hamiltonian numerically tractable .",
    "the information obtained from each iteration allows one to build up the thermodynamics and dynamics of the model .",
    "eigenstates of a given iteration are used to calculate thermodynamics at an appropriately - chosen temperature ( sufficiently low that discarded states of earlier iterations are unimportant , yet sufficiently high that the energy splittings of later iterations are thermally smeared out ) .",
    "this effective temperature decreases exponentially with the iteration number , and hence allows access to thermodynamics on all physical energy scales after only a modest number of iterations .",
    "dynamics of the model are calculated by means of the recent observation @xcite that the set of all _ discarded _ states forms a complete basis of the discretized nrg hamiltonian . by expanding the full density matrix in this basis ,",
    "accurate results for dynamical correlation functions may be obtained over a wide range of frequency and temperature scales.@xcite dynamics of the discrete nrg hamiltonian necessarily arise as a series of isolated poles : in order to capture the behavior of the original continuous model , one then convolves the discrete spectra with an appropriate broadening function on a logarithmic scale ( see _ e.g. _  [ ] ) .",
    "potential artefacts of the discretization process are minimised in three standard ways : dot - lead couplings are premultiplied by the standard @xmath108 factor,@xcite the oliveira ` @xmath10-averaging'@xcite is used to average discrete spectra with different logarithmic discretizations , and the green function is obtained not directly but from its self - energy @xcite , calculated as a ratio of two correlation functions where any remaining discretization effects largely cancel .",
    "the calculations in this work have been obtained with an nrg discretization parameter @xmath109 , exploiting the full @xmath110 symmetry of the model .",
    "we have typically averaged results for five different @xmath10s and have kept the lowest @xmath111@xmath112 states at each iteration .",
    "here we show that a physical understanding of the interplay between kondo physics , so and zeeman couplings , follows readily by considering the isolated dot ( the atomic limit , @xmath113).the latter has been considered in [ ] , from which we take results as required ; denoting the dot states in an obvious notation as @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and so on .",

    "_  at zero - field@xcite was found to be in good agreement with the @xmath0 anderson model _ without _ including so coupling , over a wide range of @xmath196 . given the results of the present paper , one naturally asks : why ?",
    "let us first summarise the experiment .",
    "the conductance of the experimental device@xcite was measured , at several fixed temperatures , as a function of the applied gate voltage .",
    "the latter was swept over a sufficiently wide range that four different electron shells ( ` groups i  iv ' ) were brought through the fermi level , one at a time .",
    "a consequence of varying the gate voltage by this relatively large amount was that the tunnel couplings to the dot ( @xmath69 ) varied from one shell to the next .",
    "as a result , the group i data were described by an @xmath0 model with @xmath353 ( and @xmath354 ) , groups ii and iii were more consistent with @xmath355 ( @xmath356 ) , while group iv had @xmath357 ( @xmath358 ) .    to understand why these data could be described by the @xmath0 model , we note that ( a ) the experimental ` base ' temperature was @xmath359 and ( b ) the kondo scales for groups ii ",
    "iv are all in excess of @xmath360 ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) of [ ] ) .",
    "assuming the so coupling to be comparable to the value @xmath361 considered above , groups ii ",
    "iv _ can _ then be described by a pure @xmath0 anderson model ( for essentially all temperatures ) , since each has a @xmath184 appreciably in excess of the so coupling .",
    "while the latter is not the case for the group i shell  @xcite of [ ] , data were only obtained down to a temperature of order @xmath32 where , according to sec .",
    "[ sec : zbb0 ] , the effects of so coupling can not be seen in the zero - field behavior alone . only by examining the behavior of the group i shell in a magnetic field ( as considered here ) , or by measuring its zero - field conductance down to a rather lower temperature on the order of @xmath362 or so , can the effects of so coupling be observed ."
