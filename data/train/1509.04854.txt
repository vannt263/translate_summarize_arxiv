    "studies of nuclear energy levels over long isotopic chains reveal structural changes as a function of n and provide important test of nuclear models .",
    "spontaneous fission ( sf ) has provided a good approach to study nuclei over long isotopic chains @xcite . in sf , the new transitions in a certain isotope are generally identified by gating on the known transitions in the particular isotope observed in @xmath24-decay or by gating on known transitions in the complementary fission fragment , which are usually less neutron - rich and well studied in most of the cases .",
    "usually , this procedure gives reliable identifications .",
    "however , in some cases , when the @xmath3-spectrum is complex , the overlapping of transition energies in different isotopes could lead to a wrong mass identification of the bands .",
    "recently prompt @xmath3 ray spectroscopy of fully identified ( a ,  z ) fission fragments produced in fusion - fission and transfer - fission reactions around the coulomb barrier @xcite have been reported where due to the advantage of unambiguously identifying the fragments , the assignments of @xmath3-rays to a particular a and z are directly obtained .",
    "the combination of the traditional high fold gamma - coincidence method @xcite and this method @xcite is expected to strengthen explorations and understanding of the evolution of nuclear structure as a function of both isospin and spin .    historically , levels of several pr isotopes have been identified from @xmath4cf and @xmath25 cm sf @xcite .",

    "these complementary methods have allowed us to identify new transitions and extend the level schemes to higher spins . in the present work the new transitions identified using ( a ,  z ) gated singles prompt @xmath3-ray spectroscopy did not require knowledge of the spectroscopic information of the complementary fragment .",

    "note that the e2 and @xmath26e2 energies in bands ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in @xmath16pr are different to indicate that band ( 2 ) has a large deformation than bands ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .",

    "@xcite implied e1 interband transitions between band ( 1 ) and band ( 2 ) in @xmath19pr .",
    "therefore , there could be a small octupole deformation or correlation in @xmath19pr and the similar cross transitions between bands ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) likewise suggest this in @xmath15pr .",
    "qprm calculations for @xmath80pr have been discussed earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "pr nuclei in this region present serious challenges in assigning bands to particular odd - z nilsson orbitals .",
    "there are _ _ k__=1/2 orbitals of both parities and large @xmath81 values near the fermi energy . the odd - parity _ _",
    "k__=1/2@xmath65[550 ] has _ _",

    "_ k__=1/2 bands can have either sign of signature splitting or near cancellation for certain admixtures .",
    "the 368.8 , 546.3 and 672.3  kev transitions in the new 3/2@xmath66 band in @xmath12pr are similar to the first three e2 transitions ( 397 , 541 and 709  kev ) in @xmath54ce .",
    "therefore , the aligned angular momentum of this new band relative to the @xmath54ce core is around 3.0@xmath313.5@xmath84 .",
    "such comparison indicates the 3/2@xmath66 band in @xmath12pr is possibly originated from the @xmath68__g__@xmath82 orbital .    as discussed in the previous part , band ( 1 ) in @xmath13pr",
    "is proposed to have a negative parity .",
    "the available orbital of negative parity in this region is @xmath68__h__@xmath85 .",
    "according to the ptrm calculations @xcite , 1/2@xmath65[550 ] band was proposed to be the low lying negative parity one .",
    "note that the negative parity band ( 1 ) in @xmath15pr in the current work was also proposed to be 1/2@xmath65[550 ] from previous qprm calculation @xcite .",
    "the band ( 2 ) in @xmath15pr does not match any configurations in the previous qprm calculations which are mentioned here for completeness @xcite .",

    "although the previous qprm calculations predicted this configuration does not have 100@xmath67 amplitude ( 91@xmath67 in ref .",
    "@xcite , 77@xmath67 and 81@xmath67 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the octupole deformation may change the signature splitting of the 1/2@xmath65[550 ] band ( 1 ) in @xmath15pr .",
    "furthermore , a small double backbending occurs in band ( 1 ) of @xmath15pr at @xmath84@xmath87@xmath310.27 mev while a little more distinct one occurs at about the same rotational frequency in band ( 2 ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , cranked shell model calculations @xcite suggest that this backbending at 0.27 mev originates from the alignment of a neutron @xmath88 pair and not a proton @xmath69 pair .",
    "thus , band ( 2 ) in @xmath15pr can also be another signature of band ( 1 ) . if bands ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in @xmath15pr have the opposite parities , the average b(e1)/b(e2 ) ratio would be around 0.05@xmath3710@xmath89 @xmath90 .",
    "this value lies between the average b(e1)/b(e2 ) ratios of the octupole bands in @xmath14ce ( 0.82@xmath3710@xmath89 @xcite ) and @xmath16ce ( 0.04@xmath3710@xmath89 @xcite ) and is smaller than that of the positive branch of octupole bands in @xmath13la ( 0.38@xmath3710@xmath89 ) .",
    "these data suggest the importance of octupole correlations in @xmath15pr as found in @xmath14ce @xcite .",
    "note the predicted center of octupole deformation is that z=56 , n=88 @xcite , so @xmath13la with z=57 and n=90 and @xmath14ce with z=58 and n=90 are close to the center and have the expected large e1 strength . here",
    "@xmath15pr with z=59 and n=90 is more similar to @xmath16ce with z=58 , n=92 , so the e1 strength decreases as one moves farther away from the center of z=56 and n=88 .",
    "spin and parity assignments of the bands in @xmath19pr and @xmath20pr are not placed in the present work because the e2 transition energies in these bands are quite similar . according to the qprm calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite , 3/2@xmath65[541 ] , 1/2@xmath66[420 ] and 3/2@xmath66[422 ] are proposed to be the three low lying states in @xmath17pr .",

    "@xcite can reproduce the signature splitting in bands ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . according to the statement in the previous part ,",
    "the x  kev level in @xmath19pr could be the 3/2@xmath65 ground state .",
    "the x+182.5  kev level in band ( 1 ) in fig .  [ 151level ] would be 7/2@xmath66 .",
    "bands ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in @xmath19pr could be 1/2@xmath66[420 ] or 3/2@xmath65[541 ] but 1/2@xmath66[420 ] is more likely , because no linking transitions are observed between bands ( 1,2 ) and ( 3,4 ) in the current work and bands ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are more likely to decay to the 35.1  kev isomer .",
    "the y  kev level could be the 1/2@xmath66[420 ] state .",
    "the configurations of bands in @xmath20pr can be assigned according to the level scheme similarity to @xmath19pr .",
    "however , such assignments can not explain the absence of bands ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) in @xmath20pr . also , our potential - energy - surface calculation reported here shows octupole deformation ( @xmath24@xmath86=0.043 ) of the 1/2@xmath66[420 ] configuration .",
    "if bands ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in @xmath19pr have the opposite parity , they can form an octupole band . in the current work , band ( 1 ) is the strongest populated one .",

    "in conclusion , new bands in @xmath92pr have been reported ; the previous questionable assignments of transitions and levels in @xmath17pr were clarified by a- and z- gated spectra and yield curves ; a new high spin level scheme for @xmath18pr has been established and confirmed by mass - z gated spectra . spins and parities of the levels in the new band in @xmath15pr have been tentatively assigned .",
