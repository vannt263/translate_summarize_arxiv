    "in ref.@xcite is introduced the notion of statistical duality and is shown that several pairs of distributions ( poisson and gamma , normal and normal , cauchy and cauchy ) are statistically dual distributions . these distributions allow to exchange the parameter and the random variable , conserving the same formula for the distribution of probabilities .",
    "the interrelation between the statistically dual distributions and conjugate families is considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "it allows to use the statistical duality for estimation of the distribution parameter .    in the paper",
    "we show that laplace distributions are statistically dual distributions .",
    "the probability density of the laplace distribution is    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is a real variable , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are real parameters .",
    "here we can exchange the parameter @xmath2 and variable @xmath1 with conserving of the same formula for new density .",
    "this new density can be named as a confidence density of the parameter @xmath2  ( for example ,  @xcite )    @xmath4    where @xmath2 is a real variable , @xmath1 and @xmath3 are real parameters",
    ".    by this means the laplace distributions are a statistically self - dual distributions  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be a result of single observation of random variable @xmath1 .",
    "if we define the confidence interval @xmath6  ( see , also , @xcite ) as     @xmath7    where @xmath8 are real values and @xmath9 , we can reconstruct the confidence density of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the identity    @xmath10    takes place for any real values @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath11 is the confidence density of parameter of the laplace distribution if observed value of random variable @xmath1 is equal to @xmath5 .",
    "it is a conditional probability density . as it follows from formulae ( eqs.2,4 )",
    ", the @xmath11 is the density of laplace distribution by definition .    on the other hand : if @xmath11 is not equal to this confidence density and the confidence density of the laplace parameter is the other function @xmath12 then there takes place another identity    @xmath13    this identity is correct for any real @xmath8 and @xmath5 too .",
    "the first and third terms in the left part of this identity determine the boundary conditions on the confidence interval .",
    "if we subtract eq.5 from eq.4 then we have    @xmath14    we can choose the @xmath15 and @xmath16 by the arbitrary way .",
    "let us make this choice so that @xmath11 is not equal @xmath12 in the interval @xmath6 and , for example , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "in this case we have    @xmath19    and we have contradiction . hence @xmath20 everywhere except , may be , a finite set of points .    as a consequence , the reconstruction of the confidence density of the laplace distribution parameter @xmath2 is an unique , i.e. the confidence density of the parameter @xmath2 is the probability density @xmath11 .",
    "so , the statistical duality allows to connect the estimation of the parameter with the measurement of the random variable of the laplace distribution .",
    "in the paper we show that the laplace distribution is a statistically self - dual distributions .",
    "the confidence density of the laplace distribution parameter is determined in case of single observation @xmath5 of random variable @xmath1 .",
    "it allows to construct the confidence intervals for parameter @xmath2 of the distribution by the easy way .",
