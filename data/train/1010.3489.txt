    "large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe is a powerful probe to study the nature of cosmological density perturbations and to extract cosmological parameters  @xcite .",
    "combined with the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , most of the cosmological parameters are currently constrained within a few percent accuracy or even better  @xcite . to continue our success in cosmology with cmb and lss ,",
    "it is crucial to predict the power spectra from theory accurately . while the temperature fluctuation in the cmb is as small as @xmath0  @xcite so that linear perturbation theory is able to provide necessary accuracy , we have larger degree of non - linearities in lss .",
    "we must take into account non - linearities of lss properly to predict the power spectrum accurate enough for precision cosmology at a level similar to the cmb  @xcite .",
    "most studies on lss , however , have been based on newtonian gravity , especially those including non - linear perturbations  @xcite .",
    "this approach has to be justified a posteriori by comparing the result against fully general relativistic one .",
    "for example , in @xcite , it is shown that the newtonian hydrodynamic equations up to second order _ coincide exactly _ with the relativistic ones  in the zero pressure case , after appropriately identifying hydrodynamical variables with gauge - invariant combinations of relativistic perturbation variables .",
    "thus , compared to the newtonian hydrodynamic equations which are closed at second order , any higher order contributions are originated from purely general relativistic effects  @xcite .",
    "a consistent expansion of density fluctuation tells us that the leading non - linear contributions to the power spectrum include third order perturbations  @xcite .",
    "thus non - linear density power spectrum naturally include pure general relativistic effects , which may have important implications as n - body simulations are becoming larger and larger to reach the horizon scale  @xcite .    in this note",
    ", we examine the general relativistic effects on the power spectra of matter density fluctuations and peculiar velocity by including leading non - vanishing non - linear contributions .",
    "our aim is to answer the question whether pure general relativistic effects can give rise to any cosmologically observable consequences . to our surprise",
    ", we find that the newtonian terms in these power spectra are absolutely dominating over _ all _ relevant cosmological scales , even outside the horizon .",
    "although the result sounds simple and pleasant , this is still a non - trivial result , because in the context of cosmology newtonian gravity is _ incomplete _ : there is no concept of horizon , the propagation speed of an action at one point is infinite , and so on .",
    "this note is outlined as follows . in section  [ sec : formalism ] , we present the formalism to set up the equations to solve , and give the solutions up to third order . in section  [ sec : spectrum ] , we compute the matter and velocity power spectra including next - to - leading non - linear corrections which include genuine general relativistic effects . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude .",
    "we consider einstein - de sitter universe , i.e. a flat universe dominated by pressureless , irrotational matter , and consider only the scalar perturbations .",
    "we work in the temporal comoving gauge where @xmath1 to all perturbation orders , with @xmath2 being a spatial index . as this temporal gauge condition , together with our unique spatial gauge condition  @xcite @xmath3 , fixes the gauge degrees of freedom completely , all the resulting perturbation variables can be equivalently regarded as fully gauge invariant , both spatially and temporally .",
    "this statement is valid in all perturbation orders  @xcite .",
    "the arnowitt - deser - misner formulation  @xcite is convenient in our case  @xcite .",
    "the comoving gauge condition imply the momentum density vanishes , i.e. @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the lapse function .",
    "the pressureless condition implies @xmath6 .",
    "therefore the momentum conservation equation gives @xmath7 , thus the lapse function @xmath5 is uniform .",
    "the energy and momentum conservation equations and the trace part of the propagation equation then become  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the shift vector , @xmath10 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the cosmological constant , @xmath13 is the energy density , an overbar denotes the traceless part , and a vertical bar denotes a covariant derivative with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "these are the complete equations we need in our non - linear perturbations , and are valid in fully non - linear situation .",
    "we introduce the density and the velocity fluctuations as @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the cosmic scale factor .",
    "we can identify @xmath19 and @xmath20 as the newtonian density and velocity perturbation variables respectively , because the relativistic equations coincide exactly with the corresponding newtonian hydrodynamic equations up to second order .    from the above equations we can derive the hydrodynamic equations of density fluctuation @xmath21 and velocity gradient @xmath22 to the third order  @xcite . the relativistic continuity and euler equations",

    "note that the relativistic continuity and euler equations coincide with those from newtonian fluid approximation up to the second order in perturbations  @xcite .",
