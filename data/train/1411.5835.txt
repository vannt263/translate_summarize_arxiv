    "a key class of dynamical non - equilibrium systems are those with absorbing states , _",
    "i.e. _ , states from which the dynamics can not escape once it falls on them .",
    "classical examples of such systems are epidemic spreading processes @xcite ; obviously , a fully healthy state is absorbing in the above sense , provided we do not allow for immigration of infected individuals .",
    "a very relevant feature of many systems with absorbing states is their ability to exhibit _ absorbing - state phase transitions _",
    "@xcite , that is , non - equilibrium phase transitions between an active state , characterized by everlasting activity in the thermodynamic limit , and an absorbing state , where activity is absent .    apart from a few exactly solvable models @xcite , the theoretical characterization of absorbing - state phase transitions is based usually on mean - field theories @xcite , field theory renormalization procedures @xcite , topological phase - space field theories @xcite , dynamical mean - field plus coherent anomaly extrapolation @xcite or series expansions for particular models @xcite . while simple mean - field theory is only valid above the upper critical dimension , application of other techniques in physical dimensions is usually hindered by technical difficulties .",
    "for this reason , a large amount of our knowledge about the properties of absorbing - state phase transitions is based on computer simulation of different representative models .",
    "the numerical analysis of this computer data represents a different sort of challenge , which is mainly hampered by finite size effects . in finite systems ,",
    "any realization of the dynamics is bound to reach sooner or later the absorbing state , even in the active phase , due to dynamic fluctuations .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by applying the finite - size scaling technique @xcite , based on the size dependence of physical observables that are averaged only over surviving runs , i.e. , realizations which have not yet fallen into the absorbing state @xcite .",
    "the critical point and various critical exponents can then be determined by studying the decay of the average of different observables over surviving runs as a function of the system size .",
    "averaging over surviving runs is , however , computationally highly inefficient . a more effective alternative is provided by the quasi - stationary ( qs ) method @xcite , in which every time the system tries to visit an absorbing state , it jumps instead to an active configuration previously stored during the simulation .",
    "recently , in the context of epidemic modeling on complex networks @xcite , bogu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , building on the traditional method of seed simulations @xcite , proposed to consider the lifespan of spreading simulations starting from a single infected site as a tool to determine the position of the critical point .",
    "inspired by the satisfactory performance of the lifespan method ( ls ) on epidemic models in networks @xcite , in this paper we consider its extension and application to models with absorbing states on regular euclidean lattices , presenting a detailed finite - size scaling theory for this new approach to determine critical properties of absorbing state phase transitions . to provide a concrete application example ,",
    "we focus on the well - known controlled case of the contact process ( cp ) @xcite in a one dimensional lattice , for which theoretical and high - quality numerical results are already available . in this way ,",
    "we are able to make a direct assessment of the reliability of the ls method . a close comparison with the results of quasi - stationary simulations is also performed .",
    "our results indicate that the lifespan method is a perfectly viable alternative to investigate critical properties of absorbing phase transitions in regular lattices .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the contact process ( cp ) represents the simplest theoretical model with an absorbing - state phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the cp is defined as follows : sites in a lattice are characterized by a binary variable @xmath1 that can take values @xmath2 ( occupied by a particle ) or @xmath3 ( empty ) .",
    "each occupied vertex can spontaneously become empty at a rate which , without loss of generality , is set equal to @xmath4 , thus fixing the time scale . on the other hand , at a rate @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the coordination number of the lattice , an occupied site creates offspring particles on its empty nearest neighbors ( note that all temporal processes are assumed to be poisson point processes ) .",
    "the creation of particles is a catalytic process occurring exclusively in pairs of empty - occupied sites , implying that the state devoid of particles is a fixed point of the dynamics ( i.e. an absorbing state ) .    on a lattice with @xmath7 nodes , the cp is numerically simulated as follows @xcite : an occupied site @xmath8 is randomly selected . with probability @xmath9",
    "the selected site becomes empty .",
    "with complementary probability @xmath10 one of the neighbors of @xmath8 is randomly chosen and , if empty , it becomes occupied .",
    "time is incremented by @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 is the number of occupied sites at time @xmath13 .",
    "we note that this prescription @xcite ( consistent with a variation of the classical gillespie algorithm  @xcite in which time is incremented in a deterministic way ) corresponds to a sequential update of events .",
    "this is the only way to reproduce offspring creation events among occupied and empty sites taking place at rate @xmath14 according to a poisson point process .    in an infinite system",
    ", the cp displays an absorbing - state phase transition at a critical point @xmath15 , between an absorbing phase for @xmath16 , and an active one for @xmath17 .",
    "the order parameter of the transition is the stationary density of occupied sites @xmath18 , which is zero below the threshold @xmath15 and larger than zero above it .",
    "near the critical point @xmath19 vanishes as a power law @xmath20 characterized by the critical exponent @xmath21 .",
    "the onset of critical fluctuations at the transition is ruled by a diverging correlation length @xmath22 , given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the finite size scaling exponent .",
    "the standard numerical procedure to investigate the finite - size scaling at absorbing phase transitions  by measuring the average of the order parameter restricted only to surviving runs  is extremely inefficient , since surviving configurations are very rare at long times .",
    "the quasi - stationary method represents an alternative strategy which consists in constraining the system to be in a quasi - stationary state . in practice , this is implemented by replacing the absorbing state , every time the system tries to visit it , with an active configuration randomly taken from the history of the simulation @xcite . for this task ,",
    "a list of @xmath25 active configurations is stored and constantly updated .",
    "an update consists in randomly choosing a configuration in the list and replacing it by the present active configuration with a small probability @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is typically chosen to be equal to @xmath28 . in any case , in the simulations presented here , no significant dependence on this parameter was detected for a wide range of variations in simulations .",
    "after a relaxation time , the qs quantities are determined during a given averaging time window . following this approach ,",
    "it is possible to evaluate the full probability distribution of the number of occupied vertices in the quasi - stationary state and use it to calculate all quantities of interest .",
    "the transition point is then determined by considering the modified susceptibility  @xcite @xmath29 close to the critical point , the susceptibility diverges as @xmath30 .",
    "as we see , the critical exponent of this susceptibility is larger than the standard one ( @xmath31 ) , which simplifies its numerical evaluation while preserving all the scaling properties . in a finite lattice of side @xmath32",

    "endemic_. endemic realizations have an infinite lifespan and their coverage is equal to the system size ; such realizations are only possible above the critical point .",
    "finite realizations , on the other hand , have finite lifespan and coverage .",
    "finite realizations can be found both below and above the critical point , although the probability to find a finite realization decreases when @xmath54 is increased above the critical point .    in the ls method ,",

    "all realizations are finite and have a very short duration . as @xmath54 grows the average duration of finite realizations increases , diverging at the critical point . above the critical point ,",
    "the probability of a realization to be endemic increases and those realizations that remain finite have necessarily a short lifespan .",
    "this is so because once a realization has been alive for a very long time , the probability that it becomes finally endemic increases . as a result , @xmath58 diverges when approaching the critical point from the left and decreases as @xmath54 is increased further . in a finite system with @xmath7 nodes",

    "the program described above has to be implemented with care .",
    "indeed , in a finite system any realization is bound to end , reaching the absorbing state , even though this might occur over astronomically long temporal scales .",
    "therefore , the distinction between finite and endemic realizations is , a priori , not clear - cut . in practice ,",
    "we declare a realization as endemic whenever its coverage fraction reaches a predefined threshold value @xmath60 , with @xmath61 a constant value between zero and one .",
    "realizations ending before the value @xmath62 is reached are considered to be finite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", reaching @xmath63 means that an infinite number of nodes have been reached by the outbreak .",
    "if so , the probability that such realization is eventually trapped in the absorbing state is zero , meaning that the realization is endemic with probability 1 .",
    "in this section , we present a finite - size scaling theory of the ls method , which enables the detailed analysis of numerical simulations . in general , the theory can be applied to any type of discrete structure . for this reason ,",
