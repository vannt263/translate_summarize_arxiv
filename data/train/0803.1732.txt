    "in the late 1980s , e. witten considered a quantum field theory whose lagrangean is the chern - simons functional @xmath2 , and proposed that the partition function of that provides a topological invariant of 3-manifolds .",
    "this path integral formula has not been justified mathematically .",
    "however , there were two approaches , called the operator formalism and the perturbative expansion , to obtain observables from the path integral .",
    "on one hand , in a mathematically rigorous way based on the operator formalism , reshetikhin and turaev constructed invariants of 3-manifolds , which are now called quantum invariants in @xcite .",
    "t. ohtsuki considered the perturbative invariant @xmath3 of 3-manifolds obtained from the quantum invariant @xmath4 by taking @xmath5-adic limit ( general cases are due to t.t.q .",
    "le ) . on the other hand , as a mathematical counterpart of the perturbative expansion of the chern - simons path integral , t.t.q .",
    "le , j. murakami , and t. ohtsuki @xcite constructed an invariant , called the lmo invariant , of 3-manifolds , and gave a conjecture ( the lmo conjecture ) which says that for any simply connectd simple lie group @xmath0 , the lmo invariant of rational homology 3-spheres recovers the perturvative invariant @xmath1 ( see remark 7.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is very significant to prove this conjecture from the viewpoint that it is related to the problem whether we obtain the same observables from the path integral by the above mentioned two approaches .",
    "le and k. habiro s theorem implies that the lmo invariant is the universal quantum invariant of integral homology 3-spheres .    when @xmath6 , the lmo conjecture has been shown by t. ohtsuki @xcite .",
    "the proof of the main result differs from that of ohtsuki for the case @xmath6 , since t. ohtsuki @xcite used some identities which are either specific to the @xmath6 case or hard to generalize to the other cases .",
    "it is announced in @xcite ( corollary 2.14 ) that the lmo conjecture has been proved , but the proof is not published yet .",
    "the goal of this paper is to prove the lmo conjecture .",
    "our proof is based on a general formula of the perturvative invariant @xmath1 and the @xmath7 .",
    "the former ( theorem [ pg ] ) was given by t.t.q .",
    "le in @xcite and the latter ( see section [ s - lmo ] ) was defined by d. bar - natan , s. garoufalidis , l. rozansky and d.p .",
    "thurston in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 gives a reconstruction of the lmo invariant .",
    "however , at least the auther , it seems to be easier to define and to compute .",
    "we should note that the definition of the lmo invariant works on arbitrary closed oriented 3-manifolds but the @xmath7 does only on rational homology 3-spheres , although this is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "in addition , we use @xmath8-weight system translates graphical derivative into the usual one . in @xcite , the auther proved that if the lmo conjecture for an arbitrary rational homology 3-sphere which can be obtained by integral surgery along some algebraically split framed link is true , then the lmo conjecture is true ( theorem [ 37 ] ) . using these facts , we will prove the following theorem .    [ 27 ] for any simply connected compact simple lie group @xmath0 , @xmath9 recovers @xmath1 .",
