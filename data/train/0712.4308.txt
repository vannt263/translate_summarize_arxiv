    "precise compensation of magnetic moments in condensed matter systems , resulting in a vanishing total moment , occurs only in rare instances when not required by symmetry .",
    "one example is spin ( s ) and orbital ( l ) moment cancellation@xcite in the sm@xmath3 ( or any @xmath4 ) ion , where hund s rule requires antialigned orientation of the spin and orbital moments ( m@xmath5=5@xmath2=-m@xmath6 ) along the quantization axis .",
    "another example is so - called half metallic antiferromagnetism ( hmaf ) , in which the integer spin moment in a half metal has the value zero.@xcite although not an af ( up and down spin directions are distinct ) , the up and down spin moments cancel exactly due to the half metallic nature",
    ". we will use the more precise term _ compensated half metal _",
    "( chm).@xcite compensation in this case is no longer exact if spin - orbit coupling is not negligible .",
    "after the initial description of the chm concept,@xcite a rational search for candidates was begun@xcite in the double perovskite ( dp ) family of oxides .",
    "dps have been around for decades@xcite and new ones appear regularly . the suggestion that la@xmath0mnvo@xmath1 is a promising candidate has been pursued by androulakis _",
    "et al._,@xcite whose samples did not seem to assume the desired charge states but which also were not well ordered .",
    "the ( full and half ) heusler structures have produced a number of hm ferromagnets,@xcite which encouraged searches for a vanishing moment member .",
    "felser and collaborators identified a band - filling criterion for chms in heusler materials , and were led to consider@xcite mn@xmath7ga , which is calculated to be very near being a chm ( there is slight band overlap ) . in this compound two mn",
    "@xmath8 moments compensate one mn @xmath9 moment .",
    "recently in the dp class , park and min@xcite have calculated possible chms in the quintinary la@xmath10vmoo@xmath1 system , @xmath10= ca , sr , ba , which are as yet unsynthesized .",
    "nakao has extended the search for chms to tetrahedrally coordinated transition metal based chalcopyrites.@xcite a true chm is not yet a laboratory reality .    originally reported 35 years ago by sleight and coworkers,@xcite the compound sr@xmath0croso@xmath1  ( scoo ) has been revisited by kronkenberger _",
    "et al._@xcite the motivation was that this member follows a series of ( known or suspected ) half metals sr@xmath0cr@xmath11o@xmath1 , @xmath11=w , re , with very high magnetic ordering temperatures ( t@xmath12500 k and 635 k , respectively ) .",
    "scoo has an even higher ordering temperature t@xmath13=725 k , the highest known in this class , and was reported to be insulating .",
    "the cr@xmath3 and os@xmath14 ions both have a filled majority @xmath15 subshell and high spin @xmath16 , eliminating possible complications due to orbital fluctuations and orbital ordering and making it straightforward to address the electronic and magnetic structure",
    ". the calculated densities of states ( dos ) indicate@xcite that , before spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) is included , the system is compensated ferrimagnet with a very small gap . the structure is cubic above @xmath17 k , but distorts slightly below that temperature to rhombohedral @xmath18 symmetry , consistent with the magnetic symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we look in more detail at the electronic structure of scoo , which also prompts us to check the isovalent material sr@xmath0crruo@xmath1  ( scro ) .",
    "first principles calculations , of the same sort that predict sr@xmath0crwo@xmath1 and sr@xmath0crreo@xmath1 to be hms , predict that scoo is ( before considering soc ) actually a ferrimagnetic semimetal with precisely compensating spin moments , or _",
    "spin - asymmetric compensated semimetallic ferrimagnet _ in which the electrons and the holes are each fully polarized and have _ opposite _ spin directions , in spite of zero net moment and hence no macroscopic magnetic field .",
    "this is a peculiar state indeed .",
    "soc degrades this by giving a nonzero total moment , but the band structure is little changed .",
    "we then look at the isovalent system scro , and find that due to small but important chemical differences , it is also a _ compensated half ( semi)metal _ and moreover the total ( spin + orbital ) moment remains vanishingly small .",
    "this is a chm in which the metallic channel is semimetallic rather than fully metallic , with the semimetallic channel having spin in the direction of the cr spin ( the ru spin is antialigned ) .",
    "our calculations are based on both cubic ( 500 k ) and rhombohedral ( r@xmath19 , at 2 k ) structures.@xcite in the distorted structure , the change in volume is less than 1% , and o and sr atoms are displaced by 0.015 and 0.006   , respectively . since comparison between perovskite sroso@xmath7@xcite and srruo@xmath7@xcite shows about 1% volume difference , difference in structures between scro and scoo",
    "is expected to be negligible .",
    "calculations ( as described below ) are consistent , obtaining a 1% smaller lattice constant for sr@xmath0crruo@xmath1  ( 7.62  ) than for sr@xmath0croso@xmath1  ( 7.706  ) . since we wish here to interpret the experimental electronic properties as closely as possible , we use for our calculations the same experimental structures of scoo ( also used for scro ) .",
    "these are the values @xmath20=7.8243    for the cubic , and @xmath20=5.5176  , @xmath21=13.445    for the rhombohedral structures.@xcite    these calculations were carried out with the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and spin - orbital coupling ( soc ) or fully relativistic scheme@xcite implemented in two all - electron full - potential codes , fplo@xcite and wien2k@xcite , which showed consistent results . in fplo , basis orbitals were chosen such as os @xmath22 , ru @xmath23 , cr @xmath24 , sr @xmath23 , and o @xmath25 .",
    "( the orbitals in parentheses indicate semicore orbitals . ) in wien2k , the basis size was determined by @xmath26=7.0 and apw sphere radii ( 1.95 for os / ru , 1.94 for cr , 2.47 for sr , and 1.72 for o ) .",
    "although the semimetallic character does not require a lot @xmath27-points like a metal would , the brillouin zone was sampled carefully with ( 20,20,20 ) @xmath27-mesh .",
    "a carefully @xmath27-mesh sampling is necessary for soc and fixed spin moment ( fsm ) calculations .",
    "the fsm calculations we describe were done with the fplo code .    for scoo",
    "we find the r@xmath19 distortion is energetically favored , in agreement with observation .",
    "we also find that scro in the r@xmath19 structure is favored over the cubic structure , by 145 mev .",
    "the distortions ( apparently due to size mismatch ) in either compound have negligible affect on the electronic structure , consistent with the fact that both ions have a filled @xmath15 shell so that band structure energy is not gained by the distortion .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    the lsda band structure near e@xmath28 ( without soc ) of scoo , which has antialigned @xmath29 moments on both cr and os and hence zero net moment , is shown in fig .",
    "[ osband ] and agrees with that of krockenberger _",
    "et al._@xcite the fully occupied os ( ` down ' , by our choice ) and cr ( up ) majority @xmath15 manifolds each have identical width of 1.8 ev , shifted by 0.3 ev in energy .",
    "the lowest spin - up conduction band at l is degenerate with the filled os @xmath15 band maximum ( flat along x - w ) , defining e@xmath28 at the point of ( accidentally occurring ) zero gap . the larger transition metal ",
    "o hybridization for a @xmath30 ion compared to that of a @xmath31 ion reduces the os spin moment from 3 @xmath2 by almost a factor of two , even though both cr and os ions have occupied @xmath15 states corresponding to @xmath16 .",
    "now we will focus on results of the scoo zero temperature r@xmath19 structure . as shown in table",
    "[ table1 ] , the cr spin moment of 2.2 @xmath2 is completely compensated with the os spin moment of @xmath32 @xmath2 and the six o moments . as displayed in the corresponding dos given in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ osdos ] , each spin channel separately has a gap , 0.4 ev for the spin - up and 1 ev for spin - down , between the cr and os @xmath15 manifolds .",
    "the majority and minority states show different hybridization , resulting in differing crystal ( ligand ) field and exchange splittings on cr and os . the crystal field splittings @xmath33 are ( roughly ) : cr , majority 2.5 ev , minority 1 ev ; os : 2.5 - 3 ev for both directions .",
    "the exchange splitting in the os ion ( just over 1 ev ) is half of that of cr ion .",
    "the distinguishing feature of scoo is that the os @xmath15 bandwidth is equal to its exchange splitting , such that the zero gap lies ` between ' the corresponding up and down bands . upon including soc ,",
    "the cr moment ( with its small soc ) is almost unchanged .",
    "the effect on os is substantial , however ; due to mixing with states of the opposite spin , the spin moment is reduced by 0.27 @xmath2 and an orbital moment of -0.17 @xmath2 is induced .",
    "the total net moment , 0.54 @xmath2 reflecting both spin and orbital compensation , is reasonable close to the observed value@xcite of 0.75 @xmath2 .",
    "( the unusual temperature dependence indicates non - standard behavior of the magnetism in scoo , so it may be premature to expect close agreement . ) the total dos , given in the inset of the top panel in fig .",
    "[ osdos ] , indicates filling of the up - spin gap due to os spin - mixing .",
    "et al._@xcite have reported moments of sr@xmath0croso@xmath1  obtained from neutron scattering , which are net ( spin+orbital ) values for os and cr .",
    "these moments should not be expected to be identical to the calculated values , both because the theoretical specification involves and assignment of the spin density using inscribed atomic spheres ( and some spin polarization in the interstitial region not assigned to either ) , and because the neutron fitting takes no account of the difference of spin and orbital form factors .",
    "the experimental values are @xmath34 for cr ( os ) .",
    "our calculated values are @xmath35 , respectively , which are close to those calculated earlier.@xcite the difference for the os ion ( which amounts to about + 25% and -25% from the mean of -0.95@xmath2 ) is large enough to be bothersome , and should be the object of further study .",
    "it has recently been observed that the net moment on os@xmath36 in ba@xmath0naoso@xmath1 is affected very peculiarly@xcite by the large soc on os , and although the os@xmath14 ion will differ substantially , the orbital component will need to be taken into account explicitly to clarify this discrepancy .",
    "scro shows some distinctions from scoo , small but sufficient to change the character of the spectrum .",
    "both cr and ru moments are 7 - 9% smaller than in scoo , but the system is still representative of compensating @xmath29 moments with vanishing net spin .",
    "relative to the ru ( minority ) bandwidth , the ru exchange splitting is larger , and the on - site energy on ru is enough lower to alter the distinguishing features of the states at low energy .",
    "the result is that e@xmath28 is pinned in a ` zero gap ' between the occupied cr @xmath15 bands and unoccupied ru @xmath15 bands ( there is a actually a slight @xmath37 ev band overlap ) .",
    "a crucial difference from scoo is that the zero total moment of scro ( due to half metallicity ) survives soc : the slight net spin moment of 0.025 @xmath2 is compensated by the induced orbital orbital moment of @xmath38 @xmath2 , see table [ table1 ] .",
    "this size of moment is negligible compared to other uncertainties , and we conclude that scro remains effectively half metallic in the presence of soc .",
    "to address the reported insulating character in scoo ( versus the low dos semimetal result obtained above ) , we applied intra - atomic coulomb repulsion @xmath39 on os ( or ru in scro ) ion using lda+u method@xcite implemented in fplo.@xcite as expected beginning from the zero gap in scoo , for @xmath39 as small as 0.5 ev an insulating phase is obtained . across the metal - insulator transition and into the insulating phase , the compensated moment in both scoo and scro remains unchanged for all @xmath39 . here",
    "the opening of the gap is not such as to produce a mott insulator ( it is a band insulator ) , but rather in the mold of a ` energy gap correction ' to lsda , which might better be accomplished by self - energy corrections suitable for itinerant state ( if it is needed at all ) .",
    "an important implication is that the os @xmath30 electrons in scoo are not in localized , strongly correlated states but closer to itinerant . if this is the case , pressure will more readily produce metalization and lead to a chm ( degraded by soc ) .",
    "calculations confirm that the main effects of pressure are to increase bandwidths , thereby reducing the moments and the associated exchange splittings and generally increasing itineracy .",
    "the differences displayed by scro relative to scoo suggest that it may not be insulating even at ambient pressure , in which it provides the first example of a chm , not even blemished noticeably by soc .",
    "the strong hybridization of the os and ru @xmath40 states , which is the cause of itineracy , is evident in the moment that opposes that of cr : it is @xmath411.4 @xmath2 on the metal , and 0.7 @xmath2 distributed over the neighboring o ions ( table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "this strong @xmath11-@xmath40o @xmath42 mixing , together with the robust s=@xmath43 moments , is almost certainly at the root of the remarkably high magnetic ordering temperature of 750 k.      in a conventional , unpolarized metal fixed spin moment ( fsm ) calculations@xcite provide at small m the ( interaction enhanced ) susceptibility @xmath44 , and gives the stoner instability if the energy _ decreases _ with moment @xmath45 . at larger m",
    "stable or metastable magnetic states may be uncovered .",
    "the behavior is quite different in a half metal , where the spin densities ( and the ground state itself ) are invariant to any applied magnetic field that does not cause the fermi level in the metallic channel to cross a band edge of the insulating channel.@xcite once the crossing occurs , one can again carry out fsm calculations to analyze the @xmath46 relation and the differential susceptibility . while @xmath46 is analytic ( and",
    "even in @xmath45 ) in a nonmagnetic metal , in a hm @xmath46 is non - analytic at @xmath45=0 and is asymmetric , and may be strongly asymmetric . the point single @xmath45=0 ( in scoo , since it is spin compensated ) corresponds to a huge range of magnetic field @xmath47 .",
    "we choose the cr moment direction to define ` up ' in the following discussion , hence a positive field is parallel to the cr moment . at zero field",
    "the net moment is zero , and positive and negative fields do not change the moment until they become large enough to shift the fermi level across a ` down ' spin band edge . at the onset of change in the moment the behavior in a hm differs from that of conventional fsm behavior because of",
    "the strong density of states variation @xmath48 at the band edge , where @xmath49 is the effective mass . as a result",
    "the differential susceptibility @xmath50 at the edge is non - analytic in m. in scoo , however , the top of the occupied cr @xmath15 bands display essentially two - dimensional step - function behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ osdos ] , top panel , ( not uncommon in perovskite structures ) , and beyond the onset the dos varies slowly .",
    "the form of the differential susceptibility at the conduction band edge ( positive moment ) is @xmath51 where @xmath52 are material - dependent constants .",
    "the calculated fsm @xmath46 curves for both compounds are displayed in fig .",
    "the non - analytic behavior is confined to low moment ( @xmath530 ) and is not clear on this scale .",
    "the strong asymmetry is striking . for positive applied field , the up spin states in fig .",
    "[ osdos ] move down with respect to the down states .",
    "because the exchange splitting is much smaller on os than on cr , the moment on os decreases ( transfer of electrons from os @xmath15 down to os @xmath15 up ) and the energy cost is relatively small , see fig . 3 for positive @xmath54 .",
    "for negative applied field , the relative shift of states is in the opposite direction , and the shift in filled states is from cr @xmath15 up to cr @xmath15 down , and this field direction decreases the cr moment .",
    "the energy cost of changing the cr moment is roughly an order of magnitude larger than for os : the os moment is much ` softer ' than is that of cr .",
    "interestingly , the cr moment softens by one - third in scro , due to differences in hybridization , and the ru moment is somewhat stiffer than the os moment .",
    "we have applied first principles , full potential , all - electron methods to assess the electronic and magnetic structures of sr@xmath0croso@xmath1  and sr@xmath0crruo@xmath1 .",
    "we have shown that the observed saturation moment of ferrimagnetic sr@xmath0croso@xmath1  is entirely due to spin - orbit coupling , and without this coupling sr@xmath0croso@xmath1  would be spin - compensated ( zero net moment ) .",
    "we have also studied isostructural , isovalent sr@xmath0crruo@xmath1 , which has not yet been synthesized in ordered form . due to the much smaller spin - orbit coupling in ru",
    ", this compound remains a spin - compensated ferrimagnetic ( to within 0.02 @xmath2 ) , and therefore is a realization of a half ( semi)metallic antiferromagnet .",
    "we have also investigated the other isovalent partner sr@xmath0crfeo@xmath1 using the same structures as for scoo .",
    "the smaller hybridization of fe increases the spin moment to 3 @xmath2 , and the cr moment decreases ( 1.3 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the result is a simple metallic ferrimagnet with a net spin moment of @xmath55 @xmath2 .",
    "williams _ et al . _ reported cr - ru disorder@xcite in their study of the srcr@xmath56ru@xmath57o@xmath7 system .",
    "however , the negligible difference of 0.01    in the ru@xmath14 and os@xmath14 ionic radii@xcite and the identical charge state suggest that ordered scro would result from the high temperature technique that produces ( almost perfectly ) ordered scoo.@xcite another approach would proceed by alternating cr and ru deposition in layer - by - layer epitaxy , either molecular beam epitaxy or pulsed laser deposition , a process which produces the double perovskite structure for @xmath58 growth",
    ". thus prospects should be good for checking for the chm state ( `` half metallic antiferromagnetism '' ) in sr@xmath0crruo@xmath1 .",
    "finally , we have performed the first ( to our knowledge ) extension of the fixed spin moment technique to a half metallic compound .",
    "we describe how this technique provides different and still important information for a half metal . for sr@xmath0croso@xmath1",
    ", it indicates that longitudinal fluctuation in the magnetic moment of os in sr@xmath0croso@xmath1  is about ten times as large as for the cr moment . in sr@xmath0crruo@xmath1 , this dissimilarity is reduced to about a factor of five .",
