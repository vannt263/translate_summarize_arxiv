    "liquid argon ( lar ) detectors need to monitor the purity of the lar since electronegative impurities ( mainly @xmath7 ) capture ionization electrons , and hence degrade the performance of the detector .",
    "different types of liquid argon purity monitors were developed for the lar detectors in use or for future experiments .",
    "for the lar calorimeters in the h1 @xcite and the atlas @xcite experiments the necessary sensitivity of the monitors to electronegative impurities is of the order of @xmath8 ( oxygen equivalent ) .",
    "the pulse height spectra from @xmath9-decay electrons and @xmath1-particles are measured in a lar ionization chamber . in the drift chamber of the icarus detector @xcite",
    "drift times of the order of @xmath10 occur . in order to measure such long drift times , it is necessary to purify the lar from to a level below @xmath11 ( oxygen equivalent ) .",
    "purity monitors with this sensitivity were built @xcite , measuring the lifetime of electrons which drift in a homogeneous electric field over a distance of about 10  cm .",
    "the drift electrons were extracted using an appropriately chosen photocathode , which is flashed periodically with a bright light pulse .    traditionally the problems encountered in designing purity monitors were ( 1 ) related to the creation of a sufficiently large drift electron cloud in order to produce clean signals above noise and ( 2 ) to the extraction of the purity with high precision and sensitivity .",
    "the purity monitor described in this paper is also based on a lifetime measurement of electrons .",
    "the method to determine the lifetime of electrons consists of measuring the attenuation of the charge of an electron cloud drifting in an electric field as a function of the drift time .",
    "the mean lifetime of the electrons is obtained from equation ( [ exp ] ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of electrons at the beginning and @xmath14 the number of electrons at the end of the drift path corresponding to a drift time @xmath15 .",
    "however , our purity monitor includes the following new features :    * a new almost monochromatic source of free electrons based on an energetic 5.3  mev @xmath1-source ; * a dipole geometry to introduce a very high field in the region of the cathode and anode , and a very low field in the drift region in - between ( inhomogeneous field ) ; * a direct start and stop trigger for a source - event from the independent readout of the cathode and anode induced signals ; * a built - in variation of the drift time , due to the different path along the dipole field lines introducing a spread - in - time for the arrival of the electron cloud on the anode ; * an event - by - event measurement of the drift time and induced charges before the drift at the cathode and after the drift at the anode , yielding the attentuation as a function of the event - by - event varying drift - time .",

    "it was deposited onto the surface of a spherical platinum high voltage cathode with a diameter of about 0.5  mm ; applying a high voltage of 2  kv produces an electric field @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the radius of the sphere , of about 80  kv / cm at the surface .",
    "the spherical electrodes were made from a 76  @xmath4 m thick platinum wire by melting one end of the wire in a flame of a bunsen burner @xcite ; the surface tension of the melting platinum was forming spherical drops .",
    "the 20  kbq  @xmath3-source with a mean lifetime of 31.9 years was dissolved in a 1.2 molar @xmath26-solution .",
    "a thin layer with an activity of about @xmath27 was deposited electrolytically on the spherical cathode .",
    "figure [ source ] shows an electron microscope picture of a cathode , having a thin layer of @xmath3 deposited on the surface ; the diameter of the electrode is 458 @xmath28 m .     mechanical design of the purity monitor.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the anode also consists of a pt sphere with a diameter of 335 @xmath29 m .",
    "a symmetrical high voltage @xmath30 applied to the two electrodes produces approximately an electric dipole drift field .",

    "the range of the 5.3  mev @xmath1-particles in lar is only about 50  @xmath4 m , i.e. , 1/5 of the used cathode radius .",
    "thus , the electric field along the entire track of the @xmath1-particle can ( in the worst case ) decrease by only 33% from the value at the cathode surface .",
    "the number @xmath13 of electron - ion pairs produced by @xmath1-particles depositing their total energy of 5.3  mev in lar is @xmath31 , where @xmath32  ev is the mean energy needed to create an electron - ion pair in lar .",
    "we stress that this number is reduced if the alpha deposits a non - negligible fraction of its energy in the lead ( the range in lead is 16  @xmath4 m ) . neglecting this effect",
    ", we anticipate here ( see section  [ sec : edep ] for more details ) that the measured quenching of this charge by the recombination ( recombination factor @xmath33 ) varied between 0.22 at a field on the cathode surface of 44  kv / cm to 0.39 at 154  kv / cm ( see figure [ charge ] ) , a variation consistent with the box model of recombination .",
    "the charge of the electron cloud at the cathode and the anode is obtained by integrating the current signals induced on the electrodes by the movement of the electrons in the drift field .",
    "the fast movement in the high field near the surface of the electrodes induces a fast rising current signal ( see figure [ pulses ] ) with a good signal to noise ratio .",
    "the argon ions have drift velocities orders of magnitude smaller than the electrons so that they do not contribute to the current signal . to summarize",
    ", the configuration of figure [ scheme ] combines the following desirable features :    * the high electric field on the cathode surface containing the @xmath1 source suppresses the recombination , * the fast drift velocity of the electrons in the high electric field near the surface of the electrodes induces a short ( approx . 1 @xmath4s ) current pulse , which can be measured . *",
    "the small drift velocity of the electrons in the central region of the dipole field ( minimal field strength is a few v / cm ) allows to measure long drift times .",

    "two circular polyethylene plates with the electrodes in the center are held by three macor rods .",
    "the monitor is shielded by a stainless steel cylinder and covered at the bottom and at the top with steel plates .",
    "the distance between the electrodes was varied between 20  mm and 50  mm .",
    "the measuring set - up is shown in figure [ setup ] .",
    "a glass dewar holding the purity monitor was mounted in a vacuum chamber . before filling the dewar with lar ,",
    "the chamber was heated to about 70@xmath34c for at least one day and pumped to a pressure of about 10@xmath35  mbar .",
    "the lar passed through a 5  @xmath36 purification cartridge containing 50% bts catalyst and 50% copper oxide .",
    "the bts and the copper oxide were reduced by controlled flowing of hydrogen gas through the cartridge before it could be used to purify lar from oxygen .",
    "the readout electronics for the two electrodes is operated at room temperature outside the vacuum chamber .",
    "it consists of a low noise charge preamplifier of the type used for the icarus drift chamber @xcite followed by a custom - made ac - coupled amplifier , which also acts as a bandpass filter transmitting frequencies from 530  hz to 760  khz ( -3 db values ) .",
    "the preamplifier integrates the current pulse from the electrode ; its decay constant is about 250  @xmath4s .",
    "the circuit has an overall sensitivity of 10.8  mv / k@xmath37 corresponding to 68  mv / fc .",
    "both electrodes have their own readout channels , which were carefully calibrated .",
    "the analog signals were sampled with 10  mhz and digitized by a 12 bit adc card in a pc ; the digital data were accumulated with a labview program .",
    "figure [ pulses ] shows the measured pulse shapes from the cathode and the anode at a high voltage of @xmath231.5  kv and an electrode distance of 20  mm .",
    "the integrated current ( i.e. the charge ) induced on the electrodes by the moving electron cloud is shown as a function of time .",
    "the fast rising leading edge of the signals is induced by the fast movement of the electrons in the high field near the surface of the electrodes .",
    "the decay of the signal is given by the decay time of the integrating electronics .",
    "in the anode signal the contribution to the signal over the whole drift time is seen : it starts with the fast movement of the electron cloud near the cathode , gets flat during the time of the slow drift through the central region of the drift field and rises sharply when the cloud reaches the anode . in the cathode",
    "signal the contribution from the drift in the low field region is hidden in the rounding of the signal after the sharp rise .",

    "[ charge ] the maximum measured charged is plotted as a function of the high voltage ( or as a function of the electric field on the cathode surface ) .",

    "the drift path in the high field ( @xmath66 1  kv / cm ) is only a very small fraction of the total drift path and contributes very little to the drift time .",
    "thus , only a small correction , depending on the applied high voltage and the distance between the electrodes , has to be applied to the measured drift time to normalize it to a constant drift field .",
