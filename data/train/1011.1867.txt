    "this paper tries to answer a simple yet important question in he - implantation studies : do ion - implanted he atoms end up as interstitial or as substitutional particles in the target matrix ?",
    "the difference is critical because of the large diffusivity difference between both forms of he : interstitial he ( i - he ) diffuses extremely fast , sampling large portions of the configurational space quickly , readily finding other defects or microstructural features .",
    "conversely , substitutional he ( s - he ) , while energetically more stable , is immobile , necessitating migration of other point defects before it can move .",
    "this can happen either by reacting with a self - interstitial atom ( sia ) that recombines with the vacancy and knocks the he back to an interstitial site , or by correlated lattice exchange reactions with a vacancy in nearest - neighbor positions .",
    "either way , the diffusivity of s - he is still several orders of magnitude lower than that of i - he .    despite",
    "the important implications of these mechanisms on the subsequent microstructural evolution , at present most researchers consider that 100%  of the implanted he is interstitial @xcite and can only become substitutional by finding an isolated vacancy in an uncorrelated fashion via long - range diffusion .",
    "the question we ask here is whether this is true for all he atoms or whether some of them can become substitutional as part of their own implantation process prior to uncorrelated diffusion taking place .    here",
    "we present a computational study involving the binary collision approximation ( bca ) , molecular dynamics ( md ) , and kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations .",
    "the bca is used to simulate the penetration of he beams of various energies into fe targets , and to obtain energy distributions of fe recoils due to he impact .",
    "md is then used to simulate he thermalization after the primary knock - on event in its own collisional environment , and to ascertain whether he atoms create stable frenkel pairs that can result in correlated recombination .",
    "finally , we use kmc to calculate the fraction of _ freely - migrating _ he atoms from those that do create defects but do not find the vacancy during md time scales . from these simulations",
    ", we find that nearly 3%  of the he atoms end up in subsitutional sites . while this number appears small , it nonetheless leads to dramatic differences in the microstructural evolution of the material , as will be shown in future studies .",
    "srim parameters for the three he - beam energies considered . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the kmc simulations consisted of a single vacancy located at the center of a reaction sphere and a randomly - oriented he atom separated from the vacancy by a distance sampled from the distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distance ] . we have used the green s function monte carlo method @xcite in a continuum fe medium with two spherical particles representing the he atom and the vacancy .",
    "the sum of the radii of the vacancy and he atom was set equal to the third - nearest neighbor distance in the bcc lattice , @xmath0 to be consistent with the he - v binding energy calculations performed in the appendix .",
    "other authors have suggested that binding occurs up to the fifth nearest neighbor distance @xcite .",
    "no further correlation between the he atom and the vacancy is assumed , _",
    "i.e. _ jumps toward and away from the central vacancy are sampled with equal probability .",
    "the critical parameters for the kmc simulations are the temperature , the diffusivities , and the size of the simulation box .",
    "the temperature was 700k , the same as in the md simulations .",
    "with respect to the diffusivities , we neglect vacancy diffusion , as its diffusion coefficient is known to be several orders of magnitude lower than that of he , even at these temperatures .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of he in bcc fe was taken from terentyev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who used the same interatomic potential as in the present work and obtained @xmath1 @xmath2s@xmath3 ( migration energy in mev ) . finally , also for consistency with the md simulations , we considered a spherical region with radius equal to @xmath4 .",
    "if over the course of a simulation the he atom escaped the spherical region , it was added to the i - he count , whereas , if it reacted with the vacancy in the center of the simulation sphere , it was tallied as a s - he .",
    "after @xmath5 events , we calculated the probability for he - vacancy recombination under these conditions to be 7.4% .",
    "the probability of he escape in an infinite medium has a known analytical solution given by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the initial separation distance .",
    "this formula yields an average reaction probability of approximately 12% , which is higher than the kmc value because it is not limited to a finite reaction volume .    when prorated to the number of cases that constitute the he - vacancy pair correlation in fig .",
    "[ fig : distance ] , this result , added to the 0.5% computed directly from the md simulations , results in a total fraction of s - he of 2.9%  in ion implanted bcc fe . the various contributions to this number are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : events ] for clarity .",
    "understanding how implanted or transmutation he is partitioned between i - he and s - he is paramount because of the different characteristics of both species in the bcc lattice .",
    "a comprehensive review on the role of he in fe has been recently published @xcite , where the basic energetics are given and a review of the existing literature is provided .",
    "all studies agree that s - he is energetically more favorable with a lower formation energy and a strong he - vacancy binding energy but can not move unless aided by other point defects . for its part ,",
    "i - he diffuses very fast in all three dimensions , rapidly probing vast regions of configuration space and finding sinks or other defects very efficiently .",
    "these different behaviors have important implications in terms of the long term microstructural evolution .",
    "for example , he in solution in the bcc lattice is known to stabilize vacancy clusters produced directly in high - energy cascades . in terms of its effect on direct damage production , however , the evidence reported in the literature is contradicting . on the one hand , some researchers using the fe  he wilson - johnson potential @xcite have found that high - energy cascades in bcc fe doped with small concentrations of s - he result in higher numbers of vacancy clusters than in pure fe @xcite .",
    "they also found these clusters to be generally larger in size . on the other hand , using the juslin - nordlund potential employed here lucas and schublin have found that it is i - he in solution that causes larger cluster sizes and number densities to appear @xcite .",
    "in fact , they observe that s - he reduces the number of stable defects with respect to pure fe .",
    "these workers also performed a systematic fe  he potential comparison , noting that the juslin potential gives results that are overall in better agreement with dft calculations @xcite . in any case , these results show the importance of determining the correct partition of implanted he , something typically neglected in most rate theory studies , where he is generally inserted as i - he ( although some notable exceptions exist @xcite ) .",
    "next we discuss the validity and limitations of our approach .",
    "this work hinges on the fact that fe recoil spectra from he ions with a wide range of incident energies are almost identical .",
    "further , assuming that recoils produce isolated cascades , data extracted from ion beam experiments can be used to infer the behavior of @xmath8 particles created in @xmath9 reactions .",
    "then , the only difference between @xmath9 reactions and he - ion irradiations is that the former are created homogeneously within the matrix , whereas ions penetrate a short distance into the material ( c.f .",
    "table [ tab : t_ions ] ) , but up to the cooling - down phase of the cascade , damage is produced in an identical fashion in both instances .    with regard to the interatomic potentials used , we have already mentioned the studies in refs .",
    "@xcite . stewart _",
    "_ @xcite have recently carried out an exhaustive comparison of fe  he and he  he potentials available in the literature .",
    "these authors noted that the fe  he potential is strongly dependent on the matrix ( fe  fe ) to which it is coupled , and that the potentials used in the present work produce little clustering .",
    "in addition , yang _",
    "_ @xcite and pu _",
    "@xcite have shown that different potentials can have a noticeable influence on vacancy cluster formation in displacement cascades .",
    "all of these effects should again be mitigated at high temperatures , yet in light of these results some variability in the final fraction of s - he can be expected .",
    "another , limitation is the assumption of uncorrelated diffusion in the kmc calculations .",
    "presumably , the migration energy of an i - he varies as a function of its proximity to a vacancy from the value in the bulk ( here @xmath10 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : barrs1 ] ) to zero in the two interstitial sites closest to a vacancy ( leading to spontaneous recombination ) . in this work , however , we have neglected this dependency , for two main reasons .",
    "first , because at the simulation temperature , the i - he diffusion barriers , which are typically on the order of 40 to 60mev ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : mig ] ) , are well below kinetic energy fluctuations , as shown in the analysis provided in the appendix .",
    "second , this correlated effect is partially captured by adjusting the interaction distance , which was set to 5@xmath11 nearest neighbor distance in this work .",
    "indeed , other ( lattice ) kmc calculations of he and he - vacancy complex diffusion have also disregarded this effect for similar reasons @xcite .    in conclusion , we have performed a computational study of he implantation in bcc fe and have calculated the fraction of implanted he that becomes substitutional during its own collisional phase .",
    "we find that a fraction of approximately 3%  is reasonable for the energy range of interest to fusion materials .",
    "damage accumulation calculations should take this datum into account , although more calculations are needed to accuratelt quantify the impact on long - term microstructural evolution .",

    "to supplement the kmc simulations conducated as part of the present work , we carried out a systematic study of he interstitialimigration in the vicinity of a vacancy .",
    "calculations of migration barriers for he interstitials in defect - free iron and in the vicinity of a vacancy were carried out using the drag method implemented by the authors in the md code lammps .",
    "all barrier calculations were carried out at the zero - k lattice constant of 2.855  using @xmath12 supercells based on the conventional bcc unit cell .",
    "the formation energies of interstitial helium in tetrahedral and octahedral sites are 4.39ev and 4.52ev , respectively . in the ideal lattice",
    "the coordinates of the tetrahedral and octahedral interstitial are @xmath13 and @xmath14 in units of the lattice constant . as can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : barrs1 ] , there are 12 tetrahedral and 6 octahedral sites in the conventional bcc unit cell .",
    "figure  [ fig : barrs1 ] also summarizes the results for the migration barriers of tetrahedral he interstitials in defect - free iron .",
    "we obtain a barrier of 58mev for migration along @xmath15 in agreement with ref .  @xcite . for migration along @xmath16",
    "the calculations yield a value of 127mev , which precisely corresponds to the enegry difference between the tetrahedral and octahedral sites as the latter coincides with the saddle point .",
    "before we address the migration of he in the vicinity of a vacancy , we first study the effect of the vacancy strain field on the energetics of he interstitials . to this end , we constructed all crystallographically distinct he - vacancy pairs that can occur within a radius of four lattice constants , which yields 78 distinct pairs .      1 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & 3 & 1 & @xmath19 & @xmath17 & 4 & @xmath20 & 31 + & & & & 1 & @xmath18 & @xmath17 & 3 & 0 & 45 + & & & & @xmath21 & @xmath17 & 0 & 5 & 85 & 123 + & & & & 0 & 0 & 0 & s & @xmath22 & 16 + & & & & 1 & @xmath17 & @xmath19 & 4 & @xmath20 & 31 + & & & & 0 & 0 & 0 & s & @xmath22 & 23 + 1 & @xmath19 & @xmath17 & 4 & 1 & @xmath17 & @xmath19 & 4 & 0 & 17 + & & & & 1 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & 3 & 9 & 40 + & & & & @xmath21 & 1 & @xmath17 & 6 & 69 & 120 + & & & & @xmath19 & 1 & @xmath17 & 4 & 0 & 4 + & & & & 1 & @xmath18 & @xmath17 & 3 & 9 & 40 + & & & & 1 & @xmath21 & @xmath17 & 6 & 69 & 120 + @xmath21 & @xmath17 & 0 & 5 & @xmath23 & @xmath19 & 0 & 8 & @xmath24 & 45 + & & & & @xmath23 & @xmath18 & 0 & 7 & 12 & 78 + & & & & 1 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & 3 & @xmath25 & 38 + & & & & 1 & @xmath17 & -@xmath18 & 3 & @xmath25 & 38 + & & & & @xmath26 & @xmath17 & 0 & 13 & @xmath27 & 55 + & & & & 0 & 0 & 0 & s & @xmath28 & 59 + @xmath21 & 1 & @xmath17 & 6 & @xmath23 & 1 & @xmath19 & 10 & 2 & 63 + & & & & @xmath23 & 1 & @xmath18 & 9 & 1 & 56 + & & & & 1 & @xmath21 & @xmath17 & 6 & 0 & 56 + & & & & 1 & @xmath19 & @xmath17 & 4 & @xmath29 & 51 + & & & & @xmath26 & 1 & @xmath17 & 14 & 7 & 58 + & & & & @xmath19 & 1 & @xmath17 & 4 & @xmath29 & 51 + @xmath23 & @xmath18 & 0 & 7 & @xmath26 & @xmath17 & 0 & 13 & @xmath30 & 35 + & & & & @xmath21 & @xmath17 & 0 & 5 & @xmath31 & 66 + & & & & @xmath23 & 0 & @xmath18 & 7 & 0 & 58 + & & & & @xmath23 & 0 & -@xmath18 & 7 & 0 & 58 + & & & & @xmath23 & @xmath19 & 0 & 8 & @xmath32 & 40 + & & & & @xmath23 & -@xmath18 & 0 & 7 & 0 & 125 +    the binding energy for a he - vacancy pair is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the formation energies of the he - vacancy pair , the isolated he interstitial as well as the isolated vacancy .",

    "the formation energy is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the total energy and the number of fe atoms in configuration @xmath41 .",
    "here , we have quietly set the chemical potential of he to zero which has a minimal effect on the formation energies and no effect on the binding energy .",

    "[ fig : bind ] .",
    "note that the two nearest he - vacancy pairs have been omitted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bind ] , since they spontaneously recombine with the vacancy leading to a strongly negative binding energy of @xmath42 ev .",
    "we find notable variations in the binding energy at least up to a separation of about 2.2 lattice constants .",
    "it is furthermore noteworthy that the variation in the binding enegry is not monotonic with the distance but exhibits pronounced oscillations that to some extent can be correlated with different crystallographic directions .",
    "we can now consider the different possibilities for he interstitials migrating in the vicinity of a vacancy . from fig .",

    "[ sec : disc ] ) that a good choice for the interaction radius entering the kmc simulations is five lattice constants ."
