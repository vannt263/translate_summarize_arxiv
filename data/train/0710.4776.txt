    "* kalkofen ( 2003a ) ) argues that the assumption of static atmospheres by val and fal is `` justified by the small temperature differences between the models which remain below about 5% of the average temperature . ''",
    "this argument is obviously misleading as it is only the difference between averages ( of different atmospheric regions / brightness components represented by individual val models ) , which consequently refers to variations on very large spatial scales and should _ not _ be interpreted as the temperature fluctuation introduced by the propagation of waves on small spatial scales ( say @xmath10 km ) .",
    "the existence of strong temperature gradients on small spatial scales does _ not _ contradict the models of val and fal if these are interpreted as average stratifications only .",

    "one must not quantitatively compare observed intensities with the gas temperature in a model chromosphere .",
    "in particular , just estimating gas temperatures by eye from horizontal cross - sections at different heights ( say with a @xmath11 km ) is certainly an inadequate approach . gas temperature can not directly be interpreted as intensity and vice versa because ( i ) the intensity does not originate from a fixed infinitesimal thin layer but from an extended height range and ( ii ) ( at least in case of the chromosphere ) `` the convenient approximation of lte no longer holds for the calculation of radiative energy transfer '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( kalkofen 2004 ) ) .",
    "a look in any textbook on radiative transfer clearly shows that opacity and source function do not only depend on the gas temperature but also on parameters as , e.g. , gas and electron density , chemical composition and ionisation stage of the gas .",
    "in particular the electron density and ionisation degree are subject to deviations from equilibrium in most of the atmosphere ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : hion ] ) and thus can not be described in lte .",
    "the chromospheric gas density is modulated by compression and expansion due to propagating waves , while , e.g. , the population densities of atomic energy levels depend directly on the ( non - local ! ) radiation field itself . even in a simple case",
    "the emergent intensity is always the result of the integration of contributions along the line of sight .",
    "it consequently represents the integrated ( thermodynamic ) conditions of an extended formation height range and _ not _ the local conditions at a particular height . in an inhomogeneous intermittent chromosphere the true thermal structure is thus obscured by an intrinsic `` smearing '' along the optical depth  @xmath12 .",
    "a comparison of observations and models is thus complicated by the fact that the gas temperature can be investigated at individual geometrical heights in the models , whereas observed intensity always originates from an extended formation height range . in some cases",
    "the corresponding contribution functions even have multiple peaks at different heights , making the use of the term `` formation height '' problematic .",
    "this is an intrinsic physical problem that can not be removed .",
    "one can only try to minimize the effect by choosing a suitable diagnostic ( with small and well - defined variation in formation height ) in combination with the detailed comparison by means of non - lte radiative transfer calculations based on forward modelled simulations .",
    "in addition the observations are technically limited by the attainable resolution in angle @xmath13 , time @xmath14 , and wavelength @xmath15 :    1 .   atmospheric seeing and instrumental effects",
    "limit the spatial scales accessible in observations and smear out features on small scales .",
    "the formation height ranges vary significantly in time and space so that intensities refer rather to corrugated surfaces of optical depth instead of plane horizontal cuts .",
    "3 .   a limited spectral resolution ,",
    "e.g. when using a broad band filter , essentially mixes together intensity contributions from different height ranges , effectively smearing out the small - scale structure of the atmosphere . for very narrow filters doppler - shifts",
    "have to be considered .",
    "in contrast to the unavoidable intrinsic smearing in @xmath12 , advances in observational technique have the potential to reduce the smearing in @xmath2 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the combination of these effects , however , can prevent the detection of a cold and diluted post - shock region behind a shock wave with current and past instruments , as such regions are quite small and exist for a short time only .",
    "consequently empirically derived temperature amplitudes bear the danger of being systematically too low .",
    "an example might be the low values suggested by and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* avrett ( 2007 ) ) , which rely on sumer observations with limited spatial resolution .      for a detailed comparison with the caii data presented here",
    "( see sect .",
    "[ sec : ibis ] ) synthetic intensity images still need to be calculated .",
    "this task , although very involved , is currently in progress . on the observational side ,",
    "doppler - shifts move too fast propagating features outside of the filter range .",
    "this effect can be corrected for as the ibis scan includes the neighbouring wavelength positions at only small delay .",
    "( a detailed publication is currently in preparation . )",
    "nevertheless the general picture exhibited by observations and simulations is astonishingly similar .",
    "both show the chromosphere as highly dynamic and intermittent phenomenon . a quantitative comparison by means of non - lte radiative transfer calculations , however , will always be hampered by the extended formation height range and non - equilibrium effects .",
    "the conclusions might thus be of limited value for our understanding of the quiet sun chromosphere .      a very promising alternative are observations in the ( sub-)millimetre range with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma )  an array of 50 antennae with diameters of 12 m on a plateau at 5000 m altitude in the chilean andes .",
    "it will commence full operation in 2012 .",
    "wavelengths in the range of 0.3to3.6 mm will be accessible .",
    "synthetic brightness temperature maps have been calculated by .",
    "the maps exhibit very similar spatial and temporal scales than the original gas temperature in the model chromosphere , which is closely mapped with this kind of diagnostic . when using the non - equilibrium electron densities from the simulation by (",
    "* leenaarts & wedemeyer - bhm ( 2006 , see sect .",
    "3 ) ) as an input for intensity synthesis , the formation height range stays on average very similar but varies less in the non - equilibrium approach .",
    "the resulting brightness temperature is even closer to the gas temperature at a fixed geometrical height plane , which simplifies the interpretation . in either case",
    "the formation height increases with wavelength @xmath17 and heliocentric position ( @xmath18 ) from centre to limb .",
    "consequently the sampled layer can more or less be chosen by @xmath17 and @xmath19 , facilitating a tomography of the three - dimensional atmospheric structure .",
    "another source of confusion might arise from assigning fixed formation height ranges to the different diagnostics ( see , e.g. , val ) . considering a substantial overlap of formation height ranges of the individual diagnostics and a significant variation in space and time ( caused by `` fluctospheric '' shock waves , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* carlsson & stein 1998 ) ) , the different observational constraints can be assembled to a comprehensive picture of the quiet sun atmosphere as , e.g. , suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rutten ( 2007 , ) see also fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] in this article ) .",
    "it might be so that the emission features like the one near 117 nm ( si , ) but also the heii line at 164 nm are formed above / in the magnetic canopy layer , while the strong shock activity , which , e.g. , produces bright points observed in the caii lines , is limited to the `` fluctosphere '' regions below the canopy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] ) .",
    "the canopy field certainly modifies the properties of upward propagating disturbances , causing distinct differences in structure and dynamics of the sub - canopy and the canopy domain .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the h@xmath2 line core tends to be formed higher up in the atmosphere than the cores of the caii lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "langangen   2007 ) ) .",
    "indeed a closer look at the high - resolution h@xmath2 line core observations by not only reveals a wealth of fibrils covering the inter - network regions but also the wave - generated `` fluctosphere '' shining through at locations where the fibrils are ( partially ) transparent . to some extent the scene reminds of floating spaghetti pushed around by boiling water underneath . depending on the structure and strength of the magnetic ( canopy ) field , fibrils can show up in the line cores of the cair lines  provided that a very narrow filter is used ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( see , e.g. , fig .  5 by cauzzi   2007 ) ) .",
    "state - of - the - art numerical simulations exhibit a highly dynamic chromosphere , which is characterised by propagating and interacting shock waves with co - existing hot and cool regions .",
    "new observations , as presented here , now have a sufficiently high spatial , temporal _ and _ spectral resolution to resolve a pattern of bright structures and dark regions . as synthetic intensity images for the cores of the prominent caii lines are still missing , these observations can only be compared to the simulations on a qualitative basis at the moment .",
    "nevertheless they clearly support the picture of the chromosphere as highly dynamic and intermittent phenomenon like it was already implied by the pioneering simulations by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* carlsson & stein ( 1995 , 1998 ) ) .",
    "even ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kalkofen ( 2004 ) ) stated that `` [ d]etailed observations show the chromosphere to be highly dynamic '' .",
    "the model atmospheres by val and fal , although certainly very elaborate , suffer from the basic assumption of a one - dimensional stratified static atmosphere .",
    "this assumption is clearly questioned by recent high - resolution observations .",
    "strong intensity fluctuations are now observed although one still should need be careful with deriving statements concerning the gas temperature .",
    "frequently it is argued that the amplitudes and minimum values of gas temperature in the model atmospheres are not observed and that they are wrong as they do not agree with the val models ( * ? ? ?",
    "kalkofen 2003b ) ) .",
    "these arguments obviously do not hold any longer in view of new observational results .",
    "val - type atmospheres should thus be considered as qualitative averages , which could at best be interpreted as variations on large spatial scales . instead of aiming at an agreement with val models , modern 3d radiation (",
    "magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations must be directly compared to observations .",
    "certainly the quantitative values of the temperature fluctuations in these models ( apart from the low to middle photosphere ) still suffer from the simplified treatment of radiative transfer and resulting uncertainties in the energy balance , which are , however , a necessary compromise in order to keep the computations tractable .",
    "the next steps towards realistic chromosphere models requires more work on the modelling of non - equilibrium effects , which are important for the energy balance and thus the temperature amplitudes in the chromosphere .",
    "an efficient non - lte radiative transfer scheme is a major goal .",
