    "in the last two decades , a great effort has been made to quantify the degree of entanglement between two quantum systems .",
    "indeed , there are different ways to measure quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "one appropriate magnitude which can be used for this purpose is the von neumann entropy of the reduced state .",
    "suppose we have a bipartite system ( i.e. it consists of two subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) so the hilbert space can be expressed as the tensor product @xmath2 of the hilbert space of each subsystem .",
    "let @xmath3 be the density matrix which describes the state of the system .",
    "the von neumann entropy of the subsystem @xmath0 is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the reduced density matrix of @xmath0 , i. e. @xmath6 with @xmath7 denoting the partial trace to the subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath8 can be interpreted as a measure of the information which @xmath0 and @xmath1 share . by definition @xmath9 , and the zero value is attained when the state is separable into the tensor product . besides , if the total system is in a pure state @xmath10 , i. e. @xmath11 , then @xmath12 .",
    "a generalisation of the von neumann entropy is the so - called rnyi entropy defined for any @xmath13 as @xmath14 in fact when we take the limit @xmath15 we recover the expression ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "both entropies share the same general properties so that the rnyi entropy of the reduced density matrix can also be employed to measure the entanglement .",
    "the von neumann entropy has been specially studied in extended quantum systems because it is a very suitable quantity to analyse their universal properties in the neighbourhood of quantum critical points @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "a well - known result is the von neumann entropy when @xmath0 is a single interval of length @xmath16 in a fermionic , unidimensional chain of @xmath17 sites , in the ground state of a conformal critical hamiltonian , with periodic boundary conditions . in this case one",
    "has @xcite @xmath18 or for the rnyi entropy @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory and @xmath21 a non universal constant that will be computed later .",
    "however , less attention has been paid to the case when the system is in an excited state which can strongly change the behaviour of the entropy @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the rnyi entropy for certain particular states , not only the ground state , in a unidimensional fermionic chain .    in order to carry out the computation we shall make use of two technical tools .",
    "the first one is based on the work of peschel @xcite and allows to reduce the dependence of the complexity of the problem on the size of the system from @xmath22 to @xmath16 . instead of studying the reduced density matrix",
    "it is enough to consider the two - point correlation matrix .",
    "the second tool can be applied when the correlation matrix has the toeplitz form , as it is in our case .",
    "then we can find the behaviour of the rnyi entropy in the thermodynamic limit using the fisher - hartwig conjecture ( or rather theorem , as it has been proven in our case @xcite ) .",
    "the paper extends the works of jin and korepin @xcite and alba , fagotti and calabrese @xcite which employ the previously mentioned techniques to compute the entanglement in excited states ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for other approaches to the subject ) .",
    "we also generalise these techniques to derive the rnyi entropy for a piece of a fermionic ladder .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we formulate precisely the problem and fix the notation . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss the connection between the reduced density matrix and the two - point correlation matrix for cases in which the wick decomposition applies . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we study the conditions under which the correlation matrix is of the toeplitz type and the fisher - hartwig conjecture holds .",
    "section [ sec5 ] is devoted to the analytic evaluation of the rnyi entropy for our general case , while some particular examples and its comparison with the numerical results are discussed in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "in section [ sec7 ] we address the physical interpretation of our results and their connection with fermionic chains and ladders .",
    "we also compute the entanglement entropy for a fragment of a ladder .",
    "finally , in section [ sec8 ] we present a few conclusions and comments .",
    "our system consists in a chain of @xmath17 identical , spinless fermions with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 representing respectively the annihilation and creation operator for the site @xmath26 .",
    "the only non vanishing anticommutation relations are @xmath27    we shall consider states that can be written as a slater determinant , i.e. @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the vacuum in the fock space , @xmath30 is a basis for the creation operators such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfy canonical anticommutation relations and @xmath33 is the subset of excited modes in @xmath34 .    in actual applications , we shall consider a free , translational invariant hamiltonian , like that of the tight binding model with periodic boundary conditions @xmath35 and the state @xmath34 is going to be an eigenstate of the hamiltonian . for the moment , however , we will keep the discussion completely general without making any particular assumptions on the operators @xmath31 .",
    "now we decompose the chain into two subsets @xmath36 and @xmath37 . adapted to this decomposition",
    "we can factor out the hilbert space @xmath38 .",
    "the goal is to study the entanglement between the two subsystems .    in order to do",
    "that we introduce the reduced density matrix @xmath39 , that in general does not correspond to a pure state , and compute its rnyi entropy . as it was discussed before the entropy of the subsystem @xmath0 coincides with that of the subsystem @xmath1 and provides a measurement for the entanglement between both subsystems .",
    "once we have obtained the reduced density matrix , we need to compute its eigenvalues in order to evaluate its rnyi entropy . considering that the dimension of @xmath40 is @xmath22 the computational time grows , in principle , exponentially with the size of the subsystem .",
    "as we will see in the next section , there is an algorithm due to peschel @xcite , that allows to reduce the exponential growth to a potential one .",
    "wick theorem is a key ingredient in the perturbative expansion of quantum field theory .",
    "it implies that the correlation function of @xmath41 points can be decomposed into the correlation functions of the different possible pairings of the points .",
    "we say that a state with density matrix @xmath3 satisfies the wick decomposition property if the correlation of an odd number of points is zero and for every @xmath42 we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 is any linear combination of creation and annihilation operators , @xmath45 is the set of permutations that preserve the order in every pair and @xmath46 is the signature of @xmath47 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that if the original density matrix of our system @xmath3 satisfies such a property , then the reduced density matrix @xmath5 also admits the wick decomposition , as one can trivially check .    in the following",
    "we will further assume that @xmath3 preserves the total fermionic number and therefore @xmath48 .",
    "this property is also inherited by the reduced density matrix .    in order to proceed we must solve the inverse problem .",
    "that is , given the correlation matrix @xmath49 and assuming that the state satisfies the wick decomposition property , determine the density matrix .",
    "to achieve this goal we diagonalise the correlation matrix that has real eigenvalues in the interval @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "denote by @xmath51 the orthonormal basis of eigenvectors with respective eigenvalues @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and by @xmath54 the basis of annihilation operators for which the correlation matrix is diagonal .",
    "they satisfy , of course , the canonical anticommutation relations .",
    "we shall consider three disjoint sets in @xmath55 : @xmath56 which contains the indices @xmath57 for which @xmath58 , @xmath59 that contains the indices such that @xmath60 and finally @xmath61 that contains the rest of indices , i.e. those with @xmath62 .",
    "consider first the set @xmath56 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 and we denote by @xmath65 the orthogonal projector into the image of @xmath66 , then we can write @xmath67 . by the same token if @xmath68 then @xmath69 . following these remarks",
    ", we introduce the ansatz for the density matrix @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 the normalisation constant .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath3 satisfies the wick decomposition property , the eigenspaces with eigenvalues 0 and 1 in the correlation matrix match and , as we will show below , with the adequate choice of @xmath73 we can also account for the other eigenvalues .",
    "if @xmath3 describes completely the state of the system @xmath74 . using this fact , we can determine the normalisation constant @xmath75 therefore , the normalised @xmath3 is @xmath76 in order to determine the coefficients @xmath77 we compute @xmath78 and , then , we can relate the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix to those of @xmath73 , @xmath79    if , for a moment , we assume that @xmath56 and @xmath59 are empty , i. e. @xmath62 for any @xmath57 , then there is a simple relation between @xmath73 and the correlation matrix in terms of the original creation and annihilation operator basis . in fact , writing @xmath80 and denoting by @xmath81 and @xmath82 the corresponding matrices one has @xmath83",
    "note that the magic of this procedure is that we have determined the density matrix , of dimension @xmath84 , through a function of the correlation matrix of dimension @xmath17 .",
    "this fact allows us to go to larger values of @xmath17 without exhausting the computational capabilities .",
    "note , however , that this dramatic simplification of the problem relies in the fact that the density matrix is supposed to satisfy the wick decomposition property , a fact that must be checked in every case .",
    "one example that satisfies the wick decomposition theorem is the density matrix associated to the slater determinant @xmath85 in ( [ state ] ) .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath56 its complementary @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , if our state of interest @xmath3 satisfies the wick decomposition property , according to the previous discussion , also the reduced density matrix @xmath5 has such a property and hence the previous considerations will be relevant for us .",
    "once we have determined the density matrix we can compute its rnyi entropy and express it in terms of the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix .",
    "in fact , using ( [ 2.0.1 ] ) and ( [ corrham ] ) we have @xmath89,\\ ] ] where in the last equality the product to _ all _ the eigenvalues of @xmath90 ( also those that are 0 or 1 ) can be included without any change in the result .",
    "therefore @xmath91,\\ ] ] expresses the rnyi entropy of the density matrix @xmath3 in terms of its correlation . in matrix form",
    "we have @xmath92.\\ ] ]    when @xmath15 , that is the von neumann entropy , the previous formulae lead to @xmath93,\\ ] ] or @xmath94.\\ ] ]    the discussion has been restricted to our case of interest in which @xmath3 preserves the total fermionic number and , therefore , @xmath95 .",
    "however a similar result is obtained in the general case , with the particularity that the transformation to the new creation and annihilation operators @xmath96 that diagonalises the correlation matrix is of bogoliubov type , and the previous expressions that involve the correlation matrix should be adequately modified @xcite .",
    "in order to be able to analytically compute the entropy of the reduced system ( in the large @xmath17 limit ) it will be crucial that the correlation matrix is of the toeplitz type , i.e. @xmath97 evidently , this property is a consequence of the translational invariance of the system .",
    "we will see now under which conditions it holds .",
    "let us consider a state like in ( [ state ] ) @xmath98 where we assume that @xmath99-operators @xmath100 satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations .",
    "this fact implies that the matrix built with these coefficients , @xmath101 , is unitary ( i.e. they form an orthonormal basis ) .",
    "then the inverse transformation is @xmath102    in the previous section we have shown that the rnyi entropy of a subsystem of the chain can be obtained from the correlation matrix , @xmath103 in particular , for the state @xmath34 , we find that the elements of the correlation matrix are @xmath104 but , if we demand that @xmath105 is a toeplitz matrix the @xmath101 must satisfy @xmath106 that is , the product @xmath107 must be invariant under translations in @xmath26 . the only functions which constitute an orthonormal basis and satisfy ( [ 3.2.1 ] ) are @xmath108 i.e. the coefficients of the discrete fourier transform . in this case",
    "the correlation matrix reads @xmath109    in the following section it will be convenient to use @xmath110 instead of the correlation matrix . in our case it has the following expression @xmath111    coming back to the correlation matrix we would like to study some of its transformation properties that result in the invariance of the entropy .    1 .",
    "translational invariance of the entropy in the coordinate space ( @xmath112-particles ) , which comes from the fact that @xmath90 is a toepitz matrix .",
    "translational invariance in the momentum space ( @xmath99-modes ) of the state .",
    "let @xmath113 be a particular configuration of occupied modes and let @xmath114 .",
    "the correlation matrix for @xmath115 is @xmath116 changing the variable of the sum , @xmath117 @xmath118 defining now the unitary matrix @xmath119 @xmath120 we can rewrite the expression ( [ 3.3 ] ) @xmath121 therefore @xmath122 results from applying a unitary transformation to @xmath90 , so that their eigenvalues are the same and the associated entropy is equal .",
    "invariance under complementarity in @xmath99-space .",
    "consider a particular configuration @xmath113 and call @xmath123 its complemetary set .",
    "the correlation matrix for @xmath124 is @xmath125 using the fact @xmath126 is an orthonormal basis @xmath127 we can decompose the last sum into two pieces @xmath128 therefore , the eigenvalues of @xmath129 are @xmath130 . inserting them into ( [ renyi1 ] )",
    "we find that the entropies of the states determined by @xmath124 and @xmath113 are the same .",
    "it is interesting to remark that these properties reflect the duality between the representation in coordinate space @xmath23 and in momentum space @xmath31 .",
    "in fact in both scenarios we have translational invariance of the entropy and also invariance under complementarity .",
    "suppose that the total correlation matrix of the chain is toeplitz and a subsystem @xmath0 which is a single block of @xmath16 contiguous sites in the coordinate space . in this case , the correlation matrix of the subsystem , which we denote by @xmath131 , is a toeplitz matrix as well . using the properties of the toeplitz matrices , the existence of a generating function and the fisher - hartwig conjecture",
    ", we can find how the entropy scales with the size of @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if we denote by @xmath132 the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath133 ( which is a toeplitz matrix too ) , the rnyi entropy ( [ renyi1 ] ) can be written @xmath134.\\ ] ] it will be convenient to transform the sum in the previous expression into a complex integral on a contour that encloses the eigenvalues of @xmath135 . to that end",
    "we introduce the function @xmath136,\\ ] ] and applying the cauchy s residue theorem we can rewrite the rnyi entropy ( [ 3.4 ] ) in terms of a complex integral : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the determinant of @xmath139 , @xmath140 and the contour @xmath141 surrounds all the eigenvalues of @xmath142 which are the poles of the integrand .",
    "the contour of integration , the poles and the cuts are depicted in the figure",
    ".    a state @xmath85 is characterised by the set of occupied modes @xmath143 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "this can be approximated by an occupation density , so we describe the state through a periodic function @xmath144 that takes values in the interval @xmath145 $ ] and is defined by @xmath146,\\ ] ] where the equality should hold for any continuous function @xmath147 .",
    "notice that @xmath148 if the modes with momenta around @xmath149 are all occupied and @xmath144 is @xmath150 if they are empty .",
    "intermediate values represent the occupation of only a fraction of the @xmath99-modes with momenta near @xmath151 .",
    "now , we can replace in ( [ vnm ] ) the sum with an integral @xmath152    the kind of occupation densities we will be interested in are piecewise constant functions . if we denote by @xmath153 the discontinuity points , @xmath154 note that the ground state of a quadratic , translational invariant hamiltonian with short range interactions , corresponds to @xmath155 taking the values @xmath156 or @xmath150 .",
    "later we will discuss the physical interpretation of more general occupation densities .",
    "following jin and korepin @xcite , we use the fisher - hartwig conjecture to compute the determinant @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "we express @xmath158 in the form @xmath159 where @xmath160 and the discontinuties are taken into account by the functions @xmath161 that have a jump at @xmath162 , while @xmath163    the fisher - hartwig conjecture ( which has been proven for our case @xcite ) states that up to a factor that goes to @xmath164 when @xmath165 , the determinant of our toeplitz matrix , @xmath157 , can be approximated by @xmath166)^l\\left(\\prod_{r=1}^r l^{-\\beta_r^2}\\right)e[\\{\\beta_r\\},\\{\\theta_r\\}],\\ ] ] where @xmath167=e^{\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi } \\log ( \\psi(\\theta))d\\theta}$ ] and @xmath168=\\prod_{r=1}^r g(1+\\beta_r)g(1-\\beta_r ) \\prod_{1\\leq",

    "this integral has been considered before in the literature .",
    "the usual strategy to compute it goes through the decomposition of the contour into different pieces with divergent integrals . after an annoying computation",
    "it is shown that the divergences cancel to render a finite result .",
    "see @xcite for the original work and @xcite for a recent application .",
    "we propose a new strategy that leads directly to the finite result in a simpler way .",

    "the comparison with the expression for the coefficient of the logarithmic term ( [ ba ] ) and ( [ 1.3 ] ) leads to the following integral identity , @xmath226 \\frac{dx}{1-x^2 } = \\frac{\\pi^2}{12 } \\frac{1+\\alpha}\\alpha\\ ] ] which can be analytically derived with the change of variables @xmath227 that also reveals the relationship with the dilogarithm function .    concerning the state 2 , first note that its linear coefficient does not depend on @xmath228 .",
    "actually it is easy to compute to give @xmath229 that agrees with the numerical results .",
    "in addition , for this configuration the logarithmic coefficient for integer @xmath228 can be analytically obtained .",
    "it has the expression @xmath230 for @xmath231 , while for @xmath232 is @xmath233 values that agree with the numerical ones that appear in the table .",
    "as it is discussed in @xcite , states whose entropy grows linearly with the size of the interval may correspond to the vacuum of a non - local hamiltonian .",
    "this can be shown to hold in our case .",
    "in fact , consider the simple hamiltonian @xmath234 that corresponds to a fermionic ladder as it is depicted in the figure [ ladder ] ( note that one must perform an inversion when joining the two ends forming a moebius strip rather than a periodic ladder ) .",
    "if we take the coupling constants @xmath235 the ground state is precisely the state 2 .",
    "a similar result is obtained for state 3 . if we consider the hamiltonian @xmath236 with @xmath237 its vacuum is state 3 .",
    "note that our results follow the _ rule of thumb _ according to which the ground state entanglement entropy grows like the number of bonds that are broken when isolating the subsystem .",
    "as it is evident from the figure [ ladder ] , the number of bonds that we break when isolating a connected subchain depends linearly on the size of the interval , which explains the presence of a linear term in the expansion of the entanglement entropy .",
    "the same is true for state 3 , while state 1 , that is the ground state of a local hamiltonian , does not have this property .",
    "in this section we will try to gain physical insights from the previous results and extend them to more general states . in order to do that , and as a continuation of the discussion in the former section ( see also @xcite ) , it will be useful to consider @xmath85 as the ground state of a free , homogeneous hamiltonian of the following form @xmath238 where @xmath239 and the coupling constants @xmath240 may take complex values . of course , due to the translational invariance of the hamiltonian the eigenstates are of the general form introduced in ( [ state ] ) @xmath241 with eigenvalue @xmath242 where the dispersion relation is given by @xmath243 the ground state of this hamiltonian is therefore @xmath244    we consider two types of hamiltonians according to the behaviour of the couplings with @xmath245 .",
    "we shall say that the hamiltonian is local in the chain if the couplings are rapidly decaying in @xmath245 , i.e. @xmath246 in this case @xcite the thermodynamic limit of the dispersion relation @xmath247 is a smooth function that generically has a finite ( even ) number of zeros where @xmath248 changes its sign , call this number @xmath249 .",
    "a typical example with @xmath250 is represented in the upper half of fig .",
    "[ fig - bands ] a.    the occupation density for the ground state will be given by @xmath251 which is a piecewise constant function with values @xmath252 .",
    "therefore , the linear term of the entanglement entropy is absent and we get @xmath253 where the constant @xmath21 depends on the precise location of the discontinuities .",
    "we represent in fig .",
    "[ fig - bands ] a ( lower half ) the occupation density for the particular dispersion relation plotted on top it .",
    "we would like to highlight some features of this result , as they will be useful for our later discussion .",
    "first we see that the logarithmic coefficient is universal as it does not change , in general , under small changes of the couplings .",
    "it depends solely on the changes of sign in @xmath248 .",
    "this does not apply for the constant coefficient , that changes as the zeros of @xmath248 move .",
    "second , the coefficient of the logarithmic term has a simple physical interpretation : it counts the number of massless excitations in the thermodynamic limit of the hamiltonian ( zeros of @xmath248 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the conformal field theory interpretation , where the central charge in a free field theory also counts the number of massless bosons . on the other hand ,",
    "if the hamiltonian has a mass gap then @xmath248 has constant sign and the entropy exactly vanishes .",
    "we will see how these properties can be translated to our second scenario : fermionic ladders .",
    "our second type of hamiltonian corresponds to a prismatic ladder with @xmath254 rails and local interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath255 where , as before , the couplings @xmath256 form rapidly decaying sequences in @xmath245 .",
    "an example with @xmath257 and @xmath258 for @xmath259 , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] .",
    "the dispersion relation for this system has @xmath254 bands , one for each value of the residue of @xmath206 ( mod @xmath254 ) .",
    "namely , if @xmath260 ( mod @xmath254 ) we have @xmath261 or taking the thermodynamic limit and replacing @xmath262 by the continuous variable @xmath174 we get @xmath263 that is , one gets independent dispersion relations for different values of @xmath264 , we call them bands . given the conditions for the coupling constants it is clear that every band is a smooth periodic function .",
    "a generic situation with @xmath257 is represented in the figure [ fig - bands ] b. we will say that the ladder has a mass gap if the dispersion relation does not vanish at any point and we say that it is critical if some of the bands changes of sign at some angle @xmath265 . to every change of sign we associate a massless excitation .",
    "the example in the figure corresponds to a critical ladder with four massless particles .    from the dispersion relation",
    "one can deduce the ground state , where all the modes with negative energy ( dirac sea ) are occupied .",
    "its occupation density represents the excess of bands with negative energy over those with positive energy at a point @xmath174 divided by @xmath254 .",
    "more explicitly , we define @xmath266 and therefore the ground state for the ladder has an occupation density given by @xmath267    as an illustration , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig - bands ] b the occupation density corresponding to the dispersion relation represented over it . in these local ladder models ,",
    "the occupation density is a piecewise constant function , like those of ( [ occupation ] ) , with rational values for @xmath155 .",
    "it is also clear that every occupation density with these characteristics can be derived from the ground states of a local ladder hamiltonian .",
    "now we want to relate properties of the entanglement entropy of the ground state with those of the hamiltonian .",
    "we will focus on two characteristics of the entropy : the existence of linear , logarithmic and constant terms and the behaviour of the coefficients under changes of the coupling constants .",
    "one first property is that the linear term of the entropy is generically present .",
    "this is not surprising because , as it was stressed in the previous section , the correct interpretation of the _ area law _ in a ladder leads to a linear dependence on the size of our subsystem .",
    "on the other hand , the logarithmic term is associated to discontinuities in @xmath144 and it is zero if the theory has a mass gap and , therefore , none of the bands cross the zero value . on the contrary ,",
    "the logarithmic coefficient is generically non vanishing if the theory is gapless , i.e. when some of the bands change of sign ( an exception occur in the unlikely case in which two bands cross the zero value at the same point in opposite directions ) .",
    "the constant coefficient is in general non null when the logarithmic term is present and it is zero otherwise .",
    "the second aspect we look at is the universality of the coefficients .",
    "the logarithmic term is always universal , it only depends on the value of the occupation density at both sides of the discontinuities and this is not affected by a small variation of the hamiltonian .",
    "the linear term , however , is not universal in general ( it depends on the position of the zeros of the dispersion relation ) but it is if the theory has a mass gap .",
    "then , @xmath144 is constant and it is not affected by small changes in the dispersion relation . notice that in this case the logarithmic coefficient is zero .",
    "finally we would like to study the physical meaning of the coefficient of the logarithmic term . as discussed before , in the case of the local chain",
    "the interpretation is very simple as the term is proportional to the number of massless excitations in the theory .",
    "here the situation is more involved because the coefficient of the logarithmic term depends not only on the number of discontinuities ( massless particles ) but also on the value of the occupation density at both sides of the discontinuity .",
    "moreover , the relation between such values and the contribution to the logarithmic term is highly non trivial ( [ ba ] ) and hard to interpret .",
    "we believe that these difficulties have the same origin that the linear term : the choice of the subsystem @xmath0 as an interval in one of the rails of the ladder ( black dots in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] ) . somehow , it would have been more natural to take for the subsystem an actual fragment of the ladder , i.e. equal intervals opposite to each other , one in every rail .",
    "it is represented by black and grey sites in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] . from the point of view of the chain with non - local interactions",
    "this corresponds to @xmath254 intervals of size @xmath16 separated by a distance @xmath268 .",
    "the question is if one can compute the entanglement entropy of such a subsystem and if it has a simple physical meaning .",
    "the answer is yes and the result is completely compatible with the interpretation of the entropy in terms of massless particles .",
    "call @xmath269 and consider the subsystem @xmath270 that actually consists of a fragment of the ladder of length @xmath16 .",
    "the goal is to compute the entanglement entropy of @xmath0 in the ground state with occupation density ( [ occ_ladder ] ) in the thermodynamic limit .    to proceed , introduce for @xmath271 @xmath272 then the matrix @xmath142 in ( [ vnm ] ) is given by @xmath273 on the other hand one has @xmath274 which implies that if we introduce the matrices @xmath275 we have @xmath276 recall that by @xmath135 we denote the @xmath277-dimensional matrix obtained by restricting @xmath142 to the indices that belong to @xmath0 , while @xmath278 is one of the intervals that compose @xmath0 .",
    "now the matrices @xmath279 commute and are diagonalised simultaneously by @xmath280 so that @xmath281 as a result , taking all together we have @xmath282 where for the ground state , in the thermodynamic limit , we have @xmath283 with @xmath284 defined in ( [ gs ] ) .",
    "therefore if we denote by @xmath285 the rnyi entanglement entropy for the single interval @xmath286 in the state whose occupation density is @xmath284 , for the entropy of the whole fragment @xmath0 of the ladder , we have @xmath287 now @xmath285 can be computed using the results of the previous section and , if @xmath288 represents the number of discontinuities in @xmath289 ( changes of sign in @xmath290 ) , we obtain @xmath291 where the constant coefficient @xmath292 depends on the position of the discontinuities of @xmath289 and not only on its number . note that given that @xmath293 , the linear coefficient vanishes .    finally the logarithmic coefficient for @xmath294 is @xmath295 which coincides with the conformal field theory result for a number of massless particles equal to the total changes of sign of the @xmath254 bands for the dispersion relation .",
    "in this paper we have studied the rnyi entanglement entropy for a subsystem of a unidimensional fermionic chain in a general , translational invariant state that can be described by a slater determinant .",
    "although the computational time , in principle , grows exponentially with the size of the subsystem we can circumvent this limitation and go to large sizes by employing the relationship between the reduced density matrix of the subsystem and the corresponding correlation matrix . in this way , we can compute easily the rnyi entropy through the spectrum of the correlation matrix restricted to the chosen subsystem .",
    "it is important to highlight that this method is only valid when the chain is in an state which fulfils the wick decomposition property . inside this set of states",
    ", there is a kind of configurations ( i.e. the factorised momentum states ) in which the total correlation matrix is toeplitz . in this case , if the subsystem is a single interval of contiguous sites in the coordinate space its correlation matrix is toeplitz as well .",
    "taking the thermodynamic limit and periodic boundary conditions we have found the behaviour of the rnyi entropy with the length of the interval , using the fisher - hartwig conjecture for toeplitz determinants .",
    "we have computed the different coefficients for the expansion of the entropy and we present explicit , general expressions for the logarithmic and constant terms , that were not known in the literature . in order to do",
    "so we apply a new strategy that allows to circumvent the problem of the presence of divergences that finally cancel out .",
    "a simple integration by parts in the complex integral shows the automatic cancellation of divergences , renders the integrals finite and makes the computations much simpler .",
    "as remarked before , neither the technical tool for the cancellation of divergences nor the explicit expression for the coefficients where previously known .",
    "we have also checked numerically the validity of this expansion for three particular states .",
    "the first of them corresponds to the ground state of a local hamiltonian , in which case we can compare our results with those derived from conformal field theory .",
    "we have shown the perfect agreement between both approaches .",
    "the other two states can be viewed as the lowest energy state of non - local hamiltonians , which is illustrated with two simple examples .",
    "finally , we discuss the physical insights that we can get from the previous expansions . in order to do that we study the ground state of hamiltonians corresponding to local chains and ladders for which the results of section [ sec5 ] apply .",
    "we analyse the universality of the coefficients and compare our results with those derived from general arguments in conformal field theory .",
    "in particular we show that in the case of fermionic ladders the latter considerations can also be applied if we take a fragment , instead of an interval , for our subsystem .",
    "a natural extension of our work is the study of the entropy for a subsystem composed of several disjoint intervals .",
    "there are some recent works where this problem is addressed for the ground state of a local chain @xcite .",
    "we would like to consider a general energy eigenstate like those in the present paper .",
    "a first step in this direction , that we took in section [ sec7 ] , is the computation of the entanglement entropy for the fragment of the ladder .",
    "this can be seen , actually , as a collection of disjoint intervals , but in very particular positions so that the techniques for toeplitz determinants and the fisher - hartwig conjecture can still be applied .    in the general case",
    "however , for intervals in generic positions , the reduced density matrix of the subsystem is not toeplitz any more , so we can not use the fisher - hartwig conjecture and the present results do not apply .",
    "the study of the expansion of the entanglement entropy for such a subsystem will be the subject of further research .",
