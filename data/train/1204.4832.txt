    "we studied the source during the last phase of the 20102011 outburst using contemporaneous / and evla observations .    in order to optimally use the information gained from these observations we first need a distance estimate for .",
    "@xcite applied various scaling relations between observables to obtain distance estimates , but they seem to settle on a d@xmath15  kpc on the basis of the assumption that at the peak of the outburst the source x  ray emission must be above 0.1@xmath16@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite mention that this assumption contradicts the quiescent counterpart identified by @xcite , as the putative quiescent optical counterpart would be too bright given this distance and the known orbital period .",
    "however , it only is too bright if there is negligible light coming from the residual accretion disc in quiescence . in several bhxrbs in quiescence",
    ", however , optical spectroscopy and variability shows that the disc does contribute significantly to the optical light on many occasions in quiescence ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the star can of course be an interloper star unrelated to : time  series optical spectroscopic observations of the star while is in quiescence will be necessary to decide on this issue . @xcite use the relation between the outburst amplitude in the optical and the orbital period between known sources and their ( approximate ) distances to estimate a distance of 7@xmath173 kpc for . in @xcite , we noted that the reported relation between the optical outburst amplitude and the orbital period ( @xcite ) does not take the source inclination into account .",
    "a high inclination leaves a smaller projected surface area of the accretion disc hence one would be inclined to put the source artificially far away using this method .",
    "similarly , high inclination sources may be considerably fainter in x  rays ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) explaining the relatively low luminosity at the peak of the outburst that one would derive for distances lower than 6 kpc .",
    "furthermore , the lack of eclipses in sources with values @xmath180.1 for the mass ratio , which we define here as the mass of the secondary divided by the mass of the black hole primary , can be accomodated for inclinations @xmath19 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , this is significantly higher than the canonical 60@xmath2075@xmath20 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) making the inclination dependent effects on the x  ray luminosity larger .    assuming that the accretion disc does not contribute significantly to the optical light in quiescence and that the source found by @xcite is related to we derived a distance lower ",
    "limit between 1.6 and 4.2 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite obtained median - resolution optical spectroscopy of during the outburst .",
    "those authors use the observed velocity shifts of the na  i  d and ca  ii  h&k interstellar absorption lines with respect to that of the local standard of rest and a kinematic model of galactic rotation to derive a lower limit to the source distance of 4@xmath21 kpc .",
    "these two lower limits together seem to favour an m2  v companion star over an m5  v companion star as the latter would lead to a lower limit of 1.6 kpc and could only be consistent with a distance lower limit of 4 kpc if the accretion disc is dominating the optical light .",
    "this leads us to adopt a lower limit to the distance of of 4 kpc .",
    "nevertheless , it has often been found that the accretion disc contributes 1045 per cent to the optical @xmath22band light in bhts in quiescence ( see references above and e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "conservatively assuming an accretion disc contribution of 50 per cent to the @xmath22band luminosity and a m2  v companion star we derive a distance of 5.9 kpc , which we round to 6 kpc .",
    "taking uncertainties such as that in the derived interstellar extinction , spectral type of the companion star into account , and allowing for an even higher accretion disc contribution , we subsequently assume that the distance to is 6@xmath172 kpc .    during the last two observations the source flux is consistent with being the same . we interpret this as evidence for the source having reached quiescence ,",
    "although a future observation will be necessary to test this better . for our estimated distance of 6@xmath172 kpc",
    "the source quiescent 0.510 kev luminosity is @xmath23for a 0.510 kev source flux of 5@xmath24 .",
    "the estimated luminosity based on the orbital period  x  ray luminosity correlation would be @xmath25 , so significantly lower than what we measured .        hence , assuming the observed flux for the last two observations corresponds to the quiescent flux and taking the distance derived above , the source quiescent x  ray luminosity is on the high ",
    "end for a black hole system given the short orbital period of 2.4  hr ( see figure  [ porblxcorr ] ; cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the quiescent x  ray luminosity is more in line with what would be expected for a neutron star at that orbital period in quiescence .",
    "however , this would be at odds with the observed spectral and timing properties as well as with the radio flux during the outburst ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . if this quiescent flux level is confirmed by future x  ray observations ( an additional deep observation is planned for the summer of 2012 )",
    "there is perhaps more scatter on the known correlation between quiescent x  ray luminosity and orbital period , or the distance to the source has been over  estimated .",
    "a distance of @xmath262 kpc would be required to bring the luminosity of to that estimated using the orbital period  x  ray luminosity relation .",
    "possible effects of the high inclination on the observed x  ray flux would make the intrinsic luminosity higher still .    in order to study the relation between accretion and jet ejection in we add points for to the known data on the radio ",

    "it seems that follows the steeper correlation between the radio and x  ray luminosity at high x ",
    "ray luminosities ( @xmath27 ) during the start of the outburst ( @xcite ) , although it is not certain that the two observations reflect the optically thick synchrotron emission typical for the low - hard state .",
    "for instance , @xcite report a linear polarization of 23 per cent for the wsrt observation on sept .  26 , 2010 which is significantly higher than the @xmath2610 per cent maximum for the linear polarisation for optically - thick synchrotron emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the source started a gradual transition to the soft state at the end of september 2010 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , hence this possibly also affects the radio flux during the evn observation on sept .",
    "in addition , the evn observation may resolve out some of the emission . finally , sub  millimeter observations at 23:30 ut on sept .  25 , 2010 ( @xcite ) , just prior to the wsrt observation of sept .  26 , 2010 found the source at 12.6@xmath172.4 mjy , a flux significantly higher than that at 4.8 ghz measured @xmath2615 hrs later with the wsrt .",
    "the high degree of linear polarisation together with the information on the sub ",
    "4.8 ghz spectral energy distribution suggests that short  lived , transient , optically thin radio events contributed to the 4.8 ghz radio flux , similar to the ghz radio emission observed by @xcite in h  1743322 .    during the decay of the outburst as traced by our evla and / observations the source seems to make the transition from the steep branch in the direction of the standard radio  x  ray correlation with power ",
    "law index between 0.6 and 0.7 , similar to what has been observed by @xcite for h  1743322 and by ratti et al .",
    "( 2012 ; accepted ) for xte  j1752 - 223 .",
    "although we only have information for two radio  x  ray observations when the source was brighter than @xmath28 those two points have a lower x  ray luminosity than the bulk of sources in this regime , or conversely , a higher radio luminosity , whereas the correlation index seems to be close to the index of 1 of the sources in this branch ( @xcite ) .",
    "at present there is no clear explanation for the steeper slope of index @xmath29 .",
    "potentially , a value of @xmath29 for the power  law index can be explained by optically thin radio emission and radiatively inefficient emission of x  rays as both radio luminosity and x  ray luminosity would scale as the mass accretion rate squared in that case ( cf .   and",
    "@xcite , respectively ) .",
    "however , if many optically thin flares would be dominating the radio luminosity , one would naively expect the sources to fall at higher luminosities than those sources following the standard correlation , the latter being a minimum non  flaring track .",
    "the fact that falls to the low x ",
    "ray luminosity side of the main pack of sources following this steeper correlation can , however , potentially be explained by the high inclination under which we view . if the x  ray emission is formed close to the black hole and accretion disc , its luminosity is reduced because of the high inclination ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the radio luminosity will not be hindered by the ( partial ) self  obscuration and reduced aspect of the source as the radio emission is thought to be formed further out than the x  rays ( here , we assume that the radio  jet axis is not nearly parallel to the binary orbital plane ) .",
    "it is unclear if the bulk of the x  ray emission is indeed formed close to the black hole , though .",
    "this effect could also slightly alter , i.e.  lower , the index of the radio  x  ray correlation .",
    "this would thus lead to inclination ",
    "dependent scatter on the slope of the sources in the radio  x  ray correlation .",
    "note that @xcite investigated whether there is a relation between the correlation that sources trace in the radio  x  ray luminosity plane with inclination but found none .",
    "this could mean that any effect of the inclination would only become apparent in sources where the inclination angle is very high .",
    "may be the only known example of such a very high inclination so far .",
    "alternatively , the fact that has a higher normalization than the main group of sources following the steeper power  law index is @xmath261 correlation could be due to a higher  than  average radio luminosity potentially caused by the presence of radio flares as we discussed above ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , at an x  ray luminosity of 3.3@xmath301.3@xmath31was not detected at limits well below the radio luminosity that would be expected extrapolating the @xmath32 correlation for gx  3394 ( see green dashed line figure  [ xrcorr ] ) . possibly the correlation index is steeper for some sources ( @xcite noted that the best  fit to the data of a062000 , v404  cyg and gx  3394 gives a power  law index of 0.67 ) . besides our measurements on other sources may fall below the correlation with index 0.6 at low luminosities as well ( e.g.  the upper limit to the radio luminosity for xte  j1118 + 480 ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) although there is uncertainty on the normalization due to distance uncertainties ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . nevertheless , our radio non ",
    "detection for an x  ray luminosity of 3.3@xmath331.3@xmath31 , for a distance of 4 and 8 kpc , respectively is constraining .",
    "the discrepancy could be alleviated if the source distance is more than 8 kpc , but this would make the quiescent x  ray luminosity higher still . only if our lowest measured x  ray flux is not close to the true quiescent x  ray flux and if the source is more than 10 kpc away is the source behaviour consistent with that found for other bhts before .",
