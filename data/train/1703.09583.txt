    "sidney coleman famously said `` the career of a young theoretical physicist consists of treating the harmonic oscillator in ever - increasing levels of abstraction '' .",
    "the accuracy of this dictum is striking when one considers the abundance of scientific papers devoted to this subject across all branches of physics .",
    "it was long been known that in the framework of the orbit method @xcite the oscillator is described by the newton - hooke ( @xmath1 ) group .",
    "for example the @xmath1 group in two spatial dimensions was studied in @xcite where the lie algebra extensions corresponding to the group extensions were investigated and the coadjoint orbits and the irreducible representations were calculated . in @xcite the planar exotic newton ",
    "hooke symmetry was investigated in relation to isotropic and anisotropic harmonic oscillator . in @xcite a rotation - less newton  hooke symmetry and the orbit method are were employed to analyse the @xmath2d anisotropic oscillator . some work on anisotropic ( 2 + 1 ) newton  hooke group was also presented in @xcite .",
    "the extended conformal newton - hooke type symmetries were studied for example in connection with the pais  uhlenbeck oscillator @xcite .",
    "this short overview is far from being utter but it shows how telling a study os this simple system can be .",
    "the orbit method was also successfully utilised to analyse systems with galilei and poincar type symmetries both in the free case and with external electromagnetic fields @xcite .    in this paper an accessible yet illuminating example of harmonic oscillator",
    "is examined in the framework of the orbit method @xcite . in case of the simple harmonic oscillator",
    "the lie algebra of @xmath0 @xmath1 group is derived from the standard hamiltonian description . in depth",
    "analysis of the coadjoint action and the dynamics on the coadjoint orbit of the @xmath0 @xmath1 group is performed in order to gain a good understanding of the interpretation .",
    "finally , it is shown that , at the level of the lie algebra the simple harmonic oscillator is indistinguishable from the damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "this conclusion arrises from the fact that the damped harmonic oscillator might be described by the same lie algebra as the undamped case if a proper canonical transformation is utilised .",
    "if an abstract lie algebra does not carry the physical interpretation of the system the question arrises how to use the orbit method in a proper manner .",
    "the author hopes that the current paper will provide some insight into this matter .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ nh ] , starting with the hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator , the lie algebra of the @xmath0 dimensional newton ",
    "hooke group is derived to set the scene for the further analysis .",
    "section [ coadjoin ] provides the coadjoint action of the group under investigation .",
    "also , the symplectic structure on the coadjoint orbit of @xmath0 newton  hooke group are given .",
    "the in depth analysis of the coadjoint orbits is presented in section [ orbits ] .",
    "section [ damped ] is devoted to the damped harmonic oscillator and shows that it may be described by the same abstract lie algebra as the undamped case .",
    "the paper closes with conclusions in section [ conclusions ] where also some outlooks are provided .",
    "to focus the attention take the hamiltonian of the simple harmonic oscillator @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the kinematic momentum and @xmath5 is the displacement of the oscillator . exploiting the canonical poisson bracket @xmath6 one arrives at the well known equations of motion @xmath7 which when put together read @xmath8 . in order to use the orbit method to describe the simple harmonic oscillator an appropriate lie algebra is needed",
    "this algebra should be such that the equations of motion on its coadjoint orbits are equivalent to ( [ harminic_motion_1 ] ) .",
    "herein such a lie algebra is constructed starting with the algebra of smooth functions on the phase space equipped with the poisson bracket ( [ harmonic_poisson_1 ] ) .",
    "the method of constructing such a lie algebra is based on the poisson s theorem stating that the poisson bracket of two quantities that are constants of motion is also a constant of motion .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ harmonic_hamiltonian ] ) i.e. the total energy of the system is the only integral of motion i.e. a constant of motion that does not explicitly depend on time .",
    "this system also admits a constants of motion e.g @xmath9 which at @xmath10 has to be understood in the sense of the limit .",
    "it is mentioned here for the sake of completeness , however will not be utilised in the present paper because there is no need to consider the time dependent generators .",
    "therefore , @xmath11 should be included in the set of generators .",
    "inasmuch as some coordinates are needed , one just checks whether @xmath4 and @xmath5 could do the job . to this end",
    "calculate the poisson bracket ( [ harmonic_poisson_1 ] ) for all the pairs selected from the set @xmath12 and find that the non - vanishing brackets are @xmath13 quick conclusion is that , in order to have a closed algebra , the @xmath12 ought to be augmented by a constant function equal to 1 . even more",
    "elegantly one may replace @xmath5 with @xmath14 and use a constant function equal @xmath15 . in which case the hamiltonian ( [ harmonic_hamiltonian ] ) becomes @xmath16 and the poisson bracket ( [ harmonic_poisson_1 ] ) , by the chain rule , reads now @xmath17 the non - vanishing poisson brackets are @xmath18 therefore the functions @xmath19 span the poisson algebra under the poisson bracket ( [ harmonic_poisson_2 ] ) . note that @xmath20 is a central generator .",
    "what was described above is known as the lie algebra of the @xmath0 dimensional newton - hooke group . at the abstract level",
    "it is a four dimensional lie algebra spanned by @xmath21 characterised by the following nonzero structure constants @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , in the above numbering of the basis , which will be kept throughout this paper .",
    "the matrices of the adjoint action @xmath25 corresponding to the generators @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the structure constants .",
    "explicitly @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the zero matrix since @xmath15 is a central generator . the generic element @xmath31 of our group can be written as @xmath32 .",
    "the coordinates for the dual to our lie algebra @xmath33 are realised by @xmath34 .",
    "the matrix of the coadjoint action of an element @xmath35 is then given by @xmath36 which explicitly reads @xmath37 an element of @xmath33 is represented as a row vectors @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "then the coadjoint action of @xmath35 is calculated by matrix multiplication of @xmath39 by @xmath33 on the right , which yields the following explicit form of the coadjoint action @xmath40 more detailed analysis of the action ( [ coad_action ] ) will be presented in the following section .",
    "the next step is to calculate the invariants of the coadjoint action i.e. smooth functions @xmath41 on @xmath33 , such that @xmath42 they are solutions to the following set of differential equations @xcite @xmath43    0 & 0 & \\omega^2 k   & -p \\\\[0.2 cm ]      0 & -\\omega^2 k & 0 & -m   \\\\[0.2 cm ]        0 & p & m & 0   \\\\[0.2 cm ] \\end{bmatrix }      \\begin{bmatrix }   \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial m}\\\\[0.2 cm ]   \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial h }   \\\\[0.2 cm ]   \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial p }   \\\\[0.2 cm ]   \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial k }   \\\\[0.2 cm ] \\end{bmatrix}= \\begin{bmatrix }   0\\\\[0.2 cm ]   0\\\\[0.2 cm ]   0\\\\[0.2 cm ]   0\\\\[0.2 cm ] \\end{bmatrix}.\\label{harmonic_inv_set}\\ ] ] there are two solutions to ( [ harmonic_inv_set ] ) , namely @xmath44 the first one is a trivial consequence of @xmath15 being a central generator .",
    "consider a map @xmath45 at each point @xmath46 , @xmath35 of the orbit through @xmath39 the value of ( [ harmonic_inv_map ] ) is constant .",
    "moreover , ( [ harmonic_inv_map ] ) is of a constant and maximal rank , therefore the preimage of a point is a submanifold in @xmath33 .",
    "each of its compact components is precisely a coadjoint orbit through @xmath39 . in the present case ,",
    "the orbit , denoted @xmath47 , admits a single global parametrisation @xmath48 so , in principle , it might be covered by a single map e.g. @xmath49 .",
    "note that , in the this example , the hamiltonian @xmath50 which was derived from the invariants of the coadjoint action is , up to an additive constant , equivalent to the initial hamiltonian ( [ harmonic_hamiltonian ] ) ( note that it must not be the case see e.g. @xcite ) . for the sake of completeness",
    "note that , the jacobian of the map @xmath51 is @xmath52 so there is a singularity for @xmath53 .",
    "this case shall not be discussed in depth for it is of no physical interest .",
    "it suffices to say that , for the fixed @xmath53 , there is one invariant of the coadjoint action @xmath54 and since @xmath11 is unrestricted , the orbits resemble the flatten cylinders . in what follows",
    ", @xmath55 shall be assumed .",
    "the poisson tensor @xmath56 on the orbit @xmath47 , written in the chart @xmath57 reads @xmath58 which is equivalent to ( [ harmonic_poisson_2 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath55 on the orbit @xmath59 the poisson structure is non - degenerate and one quickly finds that the corresponding symplectic two - form is @xmath60 therefore , employing the hamiltonian ( [ harmonic_ham_inv ] ) , one finds the equations of motion to be @xmath61   \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial k }   \\\\[0.2 cm ] \\end{bmatrix } =    \\begin{bmatrix }     - \\omega^2 k\\\\      p \\end{bmatrix}\\label{harmonic_motion_2}\\ ] ] which , when combined with @xmath14 , are equivalent to ( [ harminic_motion_1 ] ) .",
    "a further insight into the structure of the coadjoint orbit can be gained by examining , one by one , the coadjoint actions of the group elements that correspond to the generators .",
    "consider a test solution of ( [ harmonic_motion_2 ] ) for example @xmath62 that is , at @xmath63 the displacement is maximal and momentum is zero .",
    "the energy is constant and at any time is given by ( [ harmonic_ham_inv ] ) ( @xmath64 ) , furthermore @xmath65 is also fixed .",
    "the trajectory of the system , as time flies , is then given by @xmath66 .",
    "\\label{harmonic_trajectory}\\ ] ] the trajectory ( [ harmonic_trajectory ] ) lies on the coadjoint orbit characterised by @xmath67 and a fixed @xmath68 .",
    "coadjoint action of a group element @xmath69 generated by @xmath70 on ( [ harmonic_trajectory ] ) is : @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 that is to say @xmath15 and @xmath74 remain constant and @xmath4 , @xmath75 follow the elliptic trajectory .",
    "clearly , @xmath70 generates temporal shifts .",
    "moreover as the system evolves it stays on the same orbit .",
    "next , let us consider a group element @xmath76 generated by @xmath77 .",
    "its coadjoint action on ( [ harmonic_trajectory ] ) is : @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 the displacement ( @xmath81 ) is increased by @xmath82 and energy is changed exactly in such a way that the system stays on the same orbit which means that @xmath77 generates spatial shifts of the initial conditions .",
    "corresponding to the generators .",
    "the time evolution brings the system along the elliptical trajectory e.g. from point @xmath83 to @xmath41 or @xmath84 to @xmath85 . starting from the point @xmath83",
    "the system can be moved to point @xmath84 by the spatial shift generated by @xmath77 .",
    "performing a boost generated by @xmath86 brings the system from the point @xmath41 to @xmath85 .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    finally , a group element @xmath87generated by @xmath86 acts on ( [ harmonic_trajectory ] ) as : @xmath88 , @xmath89 @xmath90 i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath75 are constant , momentum @xmath4 is decreased by @xmath91 and energy is adjusted so that the system remains on the orbit . clearly , @xmath86 generates the momentum shifts . for the sake of completeness",
    "it is worth mentioning that the action of group elements generated by @xmath92 is identity .",
    "the examples of above - described actions are presented in figure [ fig : harmonic_1 ] which also , by a small leap of imagination , allows us to visualise the coadjoint orbit .",
    "a slightly more complex system which can be investigated by similar techniques is a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "take the following time dependent hamiltonian @xmath93 where @xmath94 with @xmath95 being the friction coefficient and @xmath96 is the undamped frequency of the oscillator .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ damped_hamiltonian ] ) with the canonical poisson bracket ( [ harmonic_poisson_1 ] ) yields the following equations of motion @xmath97 or equivalently @xmath98 it is an easy exercise to check that the procedure that was carried out in section [ nh ] for the undamped oscillator fails in the present case . indeed , introducing the new",
    "coordinate @xmath14 one finds that the hamiltonian ( [ damped_hamiltonian ] ) becomes @xmath99 and , by the chain rule , new the poisson bracket is just ( [ harmonic_poisson_2 ] ) .",
    "then , one quickly finds that @xmath100 which fails to constitute a lie algebra because there is an undesired time dependency of the structure constants .",
    "one way to deal with this problem is to use a generating function method to bring the hamiltonian ( [ damped_hamiltonian ] ) to a more convenient form ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consider the following generating function of the second kind @xmath101 the transformation rules for the coordinates are @xmath102 furthermore , the old @xmath11 and the new @xmath70 hamiltonians obey @xmath103 the relations between old @xmath104 and new @xmath105 coordinates can be written as @xmath106 by the chain rule @xmath107 and @xmath108 so one quickly finds that the poisson bracket ( [ harmonic_poisson_1 ] ) becomes @xmath109 i.e. the transformation ( [ damped_transf ] ) is canonical but , since @xmath110 it is not a symmetry .",
    "finally , the transformed hamiltonian takes the following form @xmath111 which , functionally is just ( [ harmonic_hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , in the new coordinates @xmath77 and @xmath113 the procedure of constructing the lie algebra as in section [ nh ] can be carried out .",
    "the resulting algebra is exactly ( 1 + 1 ) newton - hooke algebra as it was for the undamped oscillator therefore , at the level of the abstract lie algebra the two systems are indistinguishable .",
    "the difference lies in the realisation of the generators as smooth functions of the phase space coordinates .",
    "it is important to stress that the hamiltonian derived from the invariants of the coadjoint action would be functionally equivalent ( up to an additive constant ) to ( [ damped_h2 ] ) not to the initial hamiltonian ( [ damped_hamiltonian ] ) as the interpretation of the coordinates has changed .",
    "it was shown that , in the framework of the orbit method , a simple and damped harmonic oscillators can be described by the same abstract lie algebra .",
    "the simple , yet striking example presented here shows that , when the dynamics on the coadjoint orbits are considered , a simple knowledge of an abstract lie algebra does not suffice to provide the physical interpretation .",
    "what describes the system is rather a specific realisation of the lie algebra in terms of the smooth functions on the classical phase space .    particularly , the result presented in the current paper stresses the importance of keeping track of the physical interpretation when constructing the dynamics on the coadjoint orbits which might be crucial when the deformation quantisation on the coadjoint orbit is considered @xcite .",
    "one way to achieve that is to derive a relevant lie algebra starting from the hamiltonian formulation as was done in the current paper for the harmonic oscillator or in @xcite for extended galilei group also known in the literature as the galilei - maxwell group @xcite .",
    "it is the intention of the author to follow with the application of the current results in case of the poincar - maxwell group soon ."
