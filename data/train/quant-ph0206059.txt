    "is whether their average performance improves on conventional heuristics .",
    "adiabatic quantum computing , using a slowly changing time - dependent hamiltonian , appears to give polynomial average cost growth for some np combinatorial search problems  @xcite .",
    "these observations , while encouraging , are limited to small problems for which other methods , both conventional and quantum , can have even lower costs . furthermore , although adiabatic methods apparently show exponential cost scaling for set partitioning  @xcite and finding the ground state of spin glasses  @xcite , the typical performance of adiabatic quantum computing for large np search problems remains an open question .",
    "thus it is of interest to compare the adiabatic method with other techniques for np problems having a well - studied class of hard instances .",
    "this paper provides such a comparison for @xmath0-satisfiability ( @xmath0-sat ) , consisting of @xmath1 boolean variables and @xmath2 clauses .",
    "a clause is a logical or of @xmath0 variables , each of which may be negated .",
    "a solution is an assignment , i.e. , a value , true or false , for each variable , satisfying all the clauses .",
    "an example 2-sat instance with 3 variables and 2 clauses is @xmath3 or ( not @xmath4 ) and @xmath4 or @xmath5 , which has 4 solutions , e.g. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for a given instance , let the cost @xmath8 of an assignment @xmath9 be the number of clauses it does not satisfy . for @xmath10 , @xmath0-sat is np - complete  @xcite , i.e. , among the most difficult np problems in the worst case . for average behavior",
    "we use the random @xmath0-sat ensemble , in which the @xmath2 clauses are selected uniformly at random .",
    "i.e. , for each clause , a set of @xmath0 variables is selected randomly , and each selected variable is negated with probability @xmath11 . thus clauses are selected uniformly from among the @xmath12 possible clauses .",
    "we focus on the decision problem , i.e. , finding a solution , rather than the related optimization problem , i.e. , finding a minimum cost state .",
    "this allows direct comparison with prior empirical studies of heuristic methods for sat .",
    "the algorithms we consider are probabilistic , so can not definitively determine no solution exists .",
    "thus we use soluble instances : after random generation , we solve the instances with an exhaustive conventional method and only retain those with a solution .",
    "this ensemble has a high concentration of hard instances near a phase transition in search difficulty  @xcite . for 3-sat",
    ", we generate instances near this transition by using @xmath13 , though for those @xmath1 not divisible by 4 , half the samples had @xmath14 and half had @xmath2 larger by 1 .",
    "the remainder of this paper describes several quantum search algorithms in the context of satisfiability problems , and then compares their behavior .",
    "the adiabatic technique  @xcite is based on two hamiltonians @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the first is selected to have a known ground state , while the ground states of @xmath16 correspond to the solutions of the problem instance to be solved .",
    "the algorithm continuously evolves the state of the quantum computer using @xmath17 with @xmath18 ranging from 0 to 1 . under suitable conditions ,",
    "i.e. , with a nonzero gap between relevant eigenvalues of @xmath19 , the adiabatic theorem guarantees that , with sufficiently slow changes in @xmath18 , the evolution maps the ground state of @xmath15 into a ground state of @xmath16 , so a subsequent measurement gives a solution .",
    "the choices of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and how @xmath18 varies as a function of time are somewhat arbitrary .    in matrix form ,",
    "one hamiltonian with minimal - cost assignments as ground states is @xmath20 , for assignments @xmath21 and @xmath9 , where @xmath22 is 1 if @xmath23 and 0 otherwise .",
    "this hamiltonian introduces a phase factor in the amplitude of assignment @xmath9 depending on its associated cost @xmath8 .    for @xmath15",
    ", we introduce a nonnegative weight @xmath24 for variable @xmath25 , let @xmath26 and take @xmath27 this hamiltonian can be implemented with elementary quantum gates by use of the walsh - hadamard transform @xmath28 , with elements @xmath29 ( treating the states @xmath21 and @xmath9 as vectors of bits so their dot product counts the number of variables assigned the value 1 in both states ) . specifically , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a diagonal matrix with the value for state @xmath21 given by the weighted sum of the bits : @xmath32 with @xmath33 representing the value of the @xmath34 bit of @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , if all the weights equal 1 , @xmath35 just counts the number of bits equal to 1 .",

    "after these steps , the probability to find a solution is @xmath44 , with the sum over all solutions @xmath9 .    as a simple choice for the evolution , we take @xmath18 to vary linearly from 0 to 1 .",
    "we exclude the steps with @xmath45 and @xmath46 since they have no effect on @xmath47 . specifically , we take @xmath48 for step @xmath39 , ranging from 1 to @xmath37 .",
    "the expected number of steps required to find a solution is @xmath49 , providing a commonly used proxy for the computational cost of discrete methods , pending further study of clock rates for the underlying gate operations and the ability of compilers to eliminate redundant operations . as also observed with conventional heuristics , the cost distribution for random @xmath0-sat is highly skewed , so a few instances dominate the mean cost .",
    "instead , we use the median cost to indicate typical behavior .",

    "identifying such choices and characterizing their performance are major issues for this algorithm , though mean - field approximations based on a few problem parameters , e.g. , the ratio @xmath73 for @xmath0-sat , can give reasonably good choices .",

    "the expected cost in the ground state drops rapidly at the minimum gap location , in contrast to the smooth behavior for instances with larger gaps ( as , for example , in fig .",

    "detailed quantitative comparison of the typical behaviors due to small minimum gaps and conventional heuristics requires larger problem sizes .",
    "nevertheless , we can gain some insight from instances with small gaps for @xmath100 , which tend to have high costs for both the quantum methods and conventional heuristics , such as gsat  @xcite , even when restricting comparison to problems with the same numbers of variables and solutions .",
    "for the instance shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.gap cost ] , gsat trials readily reach states with 1 or 2 conflicts , but have a relatively low chance to find the solution .",

    "simple problems or algorithms ignoring problem structure allow determining the gap for large @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this is difficult for random sat .",
    "for instance , although random @xmath0-sat corresponds to random costs for @xmath16 and the extreme eigenvalues of random matrices can be determined when elements are chosen independently  @xcite , the costs of nearby states for sat instances are highly correlated since they likely conflict with many of the same clauses . alternatively , upper  @xcite and lower  @xcite bounds for eigenvalues can be based on classes of trial vectors .",
    "for instance , vectors whose components for state @xmath9 depend only on @xmath8 give fairly close upper bounds for the ground state of random 3-sat , on average , as well as a mean - field approximation for the heuristic method  @xcite . however , simple lower bounds for higher energy states are below the upper bound for the ground state for some values of @xmath18 , and so do not give useful estimates for @xmath89 . furthermore ,",
    "typical soluble instances have exponentially many solutions ( although still an exponentially small fraction of all states ) .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> the discrete formulation of adiabatic quantum computing is compared with other search methods , classical and quantum , for random satisfiability ( sat ) problems . with the number of steps growing only as the cube of the number of variables , the adiabatic method gives solution probabilities close to 1 for problem sizes feasible to evaluate via simulation on current computers . however , for these sizes the minimum energy gaps of most instances are fairly large , so the good performance scaling seen for small problems may not reflect asymptotic behavior where costs are dominated by tiny gaps . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the resulting search costs are much higher than for other methods </S>",
    "<S> . variants of the quantum algorithm that do not match the adiabatic limit give lower costs , on average , and slower growth than the conventional gsat heuristic method . </S>"
