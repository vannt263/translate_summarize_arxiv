    "we then qualitatively explain the wavelength - dependent dissociation asymmetry by analyzing the real - time propagation of the electron - nuclear wavepackets during the interaction .",
    "further results demonstrate that the few - cycle mid - infrared pulse can create a strong nuclear vibration and effectively localize the electron at one of the dissociating nuclei with weak ionization .",

    "most of the wavepackets dissociate with the protons due to the nuclear vibration after the ionization [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , ] .",
    "but longer wavelength will cause stronger vibration and thus much more wavepackets will be further ionized by the driving field of high intensity @xcite . consequently , for 1600 nm , almost all the wavepackets have been ionized before the pulse is turned off and only few wavepackets are dissociated [ fig .",

    "note that the absolute asymmetry parameter @xmath40 is closely associated with the total dissociation probability @xcite .",

    "the results under four wavelengths for different intensities are depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] , the total ionization probabilities for all wavelengths are less than 15% , and the total dissociation probability increases rapidly with the wavelength .",

    "note again that the asymmetry @xmath40 is closely related to the dissociation probability .",

    "[ fig5 ] , and its position moves from high to low intensities when the wavelength is increased .",
    "the offset of the dissociation peak can be understood as that the longer - wavelength pulse can create stronger nuclear vibration and thus the dissociation probability increases more rapidly .",
    "but meanwhile , because of the intense nuclear vibration for the long - wavelength pulse , the ionization also increases rapidly , resulting in the early decrease of the dissociation probability .    by focusing on the given region of the intensity between the vertical dash lines in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , one can find that the variations of the dissociation probability with the intensity under different wavelength are generally coincident with those of @xmath45 in each column of fig .",

    "more than 72% of the dissociative ( and 43% of all ) wavepackets are localized on one of the dissociating nuclei .",

    "the coherent superposition of the dissociative wavepackets on the gerade and ungerade states finally leads to a localization of the electron at either of the nuclei @xcite . because ( a ) the motion of the wavepackets depends on the pulse intensity and wavelength , ( b ) the one - photon crossing point depends on the wavelength , and ( c ) the coupling field is sensitive to the cep , the population transfer will be different if the intensity , wavelength or cep is changed . as a result ,",
    "the electron localization depends on the cep , intensity and wavelength of the pulse .    to verify the interpretation for the origin of the phase - shift discussing above ,",
    "we show a comparison of the time - dependent asymmetry versus the time - dependent internuclear distance for different laser parameters in fig .",
    "here are the calculation details .",
    "for the tdse approach beyond born - oppenheimer approximation in the present study , the individual time - dependent population on the ground or excited states could nt be calculated in principle . instead",

    "the variations of the time - dependent internuclear distances are almost coincident before they reach the coupling point , and the asymmetries [ @xmath68 oscillate with the electric fields in a similar way . however , after the internuclear distances reach the coupling point , the asymmetries vary in completely different ways and finally lead to the different localizations of the electron , as shown in fig .",
