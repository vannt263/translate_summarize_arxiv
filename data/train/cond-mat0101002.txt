    "effects of the inter - electron interaction on the transport through small interacting systems have been a subject of current interest .",
    "for instance , the kondo effect expected to be observed in a quantum dot@xcite has been studied intensively from both theoretical@xcite and experimental sides.@xcite also , the tomonaga - luttinger behavior expected in one - dimensional systems@xcite has been investigated in a quantum wire.@xcite    for studying the quantum transport of small systems theoretically , a formulation which is able to treat both the interaction and interference effects in a unified way is necessary .",
    "meir and wingreen@xcite have presented one such framework using the nonequilibrium keldysh formalism .",
    "@xcite especially , eq .  ( 6 ) of ref .   is a general formula for the total current , and is available for various systems .",
    "while the quantum transport theory for nonequilibrium states is important to understand the physics in small systems , there are some ambiguities for determining the stationary state .",
    "so , it seems to be still meaningful to describe a formulation based on the linear response theory . in the kubo formalism",
    ", the conductance for non - interacting electrons at @xmath4 can be expressed in terms of the green s function at fermi energy.@xcite this is also true for interacting electrons if the ground state is a fermi liquid.@xcite the purpose of this paper is to apply a quasi - particle description of a fermi liquid to the conductance of a small interacting systems . at @xmath4 , an effective hamiltonian for free quasi - particles",
    "can be defined microscopically based on the perturbation theory , which reproduces the value of the green s function at @xmath0 .",
    "this kind of an effective hamiltonian has been introduced , for instance , for the single anderson impurity and systems with a translational invariance.@xcite one of the characteristics of the small interacting system is that the self - energy has off - diagonal elements .",
    "this is because generally the system consists of a number of resonant states and has no translational invariance .",
    "specifically , we apply the method to a hubbard chain of finite size @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) connected to non - interacting leads . this system can be regarded as a model for a mott - hubbard insulator of nanometer scale .",
    "also , for small @xmath1 , the system can regarded as a model for a series of quantum dots , which has been examined by advanced numerical methods such as the numerical renormalization group@xcite and quantum monte carlo methods.@xcite it may also be considered as a model for a quantum wire , which has been studied with the bosonization approach take into account the umklapp scattering .",
    "@xcite we calculate all the elements of a @xmath5 matrix self - energy within the second order in @xmath3 in the electron - hole symmetric case .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian is taken to be connected including the coupling between the hubbard chain and leads in it as that in the case of the anderson impurity.@xcite in the previous paper,@xcite we have reported the results obtained in a special case @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the tunneling matrix element between the chain and the left ( right ) lead , and @xmath9 is the hopping matrix element of the chain . in this case , one can obtain the self - energy analytically owing to the property that the non - interacting system has the translational invariance .",
    "however , this particular feature is realized only in this case , and some behaviors seeing in the results seem to depend on it : the reduction of the conductance for even @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath10 for small @xmath3 , and in the limit of large even @xmath1 the conductance tends to be finite .    in the present work",
    ", we examine the dependence of the conductance on the coupling @xmath7 and @xmath8 calculating the self - energy numerically .",
    "in contrast to the special case mentioned above , the results obtained in weak coupling cases @xmath11 , @xmath12 show quite different behaviors : the reduction of the conductance for even @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath13 for small @xmath3 , and the conductance tends to zero for large even @xmath1 .",
    "physically , the difference between the weak coupling cases @xmath7 , @xmath14 and the special case @xmath15 is caused by whether @xmath1 revels in the chain form distinguishable resonant states or not .",
    "the effect of the interaction is enhanced for the weak coupling cases .",
    "it is also shown generally beyond the second - order perturbation that the perfect transmission occurs for odd @xmath1 when the system has both the inversion symmetry @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "this is due to kondo resonance and independent of the values of @xmath18 and @xmath3 .",

    "therefore , we take the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian @xmath44 to be connected by including the mixing term @xmath32 in it ; @xmath45 our working hypothesis is that the ground state is changed continuously against the adiabatic switching - on of the interaction @xmath43 .",

    "[ fig : single ] , a cross over from a high temperature phase to the low temperature fermi liquid phase is expected in many cases .",
    "this is because , due to the connection with the reservoirs , not only the energy scale corresponding to the level spacing of the isolated interacting system of size @xmath1 but also the level width introduced through @xmath100 and @xmath101 , i.e. , the imaginary part of the mixing term eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_mix ] ) , plays a role of the cut - off . in this sense , as mentioned above , the system can be regarded as a generalized anderson impurity with @xmath1 resonant states .",

    "since this simple discussion does not take into account various effects such as the back and umklapp scatterings , the characteristic energy will be different depending on the details of the situations . specifically , in the electron - hole symmetric case of the hubbard chain examined in the following chapters , the characteristic energy depends on whether @xmath1 is even or odd , and it should be the mott - hubbard gap @xmath113 or the kondo temperature @xmath114 . again , due to the contribution of the mixing , the low energy excitations below the characteristic energy scale are described by the fermi liquid as far as @xmath1 is finite . for even @xmath1 , the mott - hubbard gap opens in the thermodynamic limit of the usual hubbard model without reservoirs , and the corresponding tendency should be seen in the present system of finite @xmath1 .",

    "the ground state of the small system belongs to this limit , and in the case of the small hubbard chain the even - odd behavior can be seen at low temperatures since @xmath114 is finite for small @xmath1 .",
    "this kind of a mesoscopic limit is expected to be realized in quantum dots or quantum wire of nanometer size , and our aim here is to develop a fermi - liquid theory for the mesoscopic systems .",

    "<S> we study effects of electron correlation on the transport through a small interacting system connected to reservoirs using an effective hamiltonian which describes the free quasi - particles of a fermi liquid . </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian is defined microscopically with the value of the self - energy at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we apply the method to a hubbard chain of finite size @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , and calculate the self - energy within the second order in @xmath3 in the electron - hole symmetric case . </S>",
    "<S> when the couplings between the chain and the reservoirs on the left and right are small , the conductance for even @xmath1 decreases with increasing @xmath1 showing a tendency toward a mott - hubbard insulator . </S>",
    "<S> this is caused by the off - diagonal element of the self - energy , and this behavior is qualitatively different from that in the special case examined in the previous work . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the effects of the asymmetry in the two couplings . while the perfect transmission due to the kondo resonance occurs for any odd @xmath1 in the symmetric coupling , the conductance for odd @xmath1 decreases with increasing @xmath1 in the case of the asymmetric coupling . </S>"
