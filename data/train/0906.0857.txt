    "cellular automata ( ca ) are a widely used formal model for complex systems with applications in many different fields ranging from physics to biology , computer science , mathematics , _",
    "etc._. although applications mainly concern two or higher dimensional ca , the study of the dynamical behavior has been mostly carried on in dimension @xmath0 . only few results are known for dimension @xmath1 , and practically speaking , a systematic study of 2d ca dynamics has just started ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "this paper contributes the following main results :    * properties characterizing quasi - expansive 2d ca ; * topological entropy of quasi - expansive 2d ca is infinite ; * a dichotomy for quasi - sensitivity . * a tight relation between closingness and openness ; * undecidability of closingness for 2d ca ;    it is well - known that there is no positively expansive 2d ca  @xcite .    however , the absence of positively expansive 2d ca seems , at a certain extent , more an artifact of cantor metric than an intrinsic property of ca . in this paper",
    "we introduce a new notion , namely _ quasi - expansivity _ , to capture this intuition .",
    "we prove that quasi - expansivity shares with positive expansivity several properties ( theorems  [ th : expclosing ] ,  [ th : expmixing ] and proposition  [ prop : bipexp ] ) and it seems to us the good notion for studying `` this kind '' of dynamics in dimension 2 or higher .    by a result in  @xcite ,",
    "the classical dichotomy between sensitive and almost equicontinuous ca is no more true in dimension 2 or higher . in this paper",
    ", we prove that the dichotomy theorem still holds ( proposition  [ prop : quasisens ] ) if the notion of sensitivity is suitably changed .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the notion of closingness has been generalized to 2d and higher .",
    "theorem  [ th:2closingopen ] states that bi - closing 2d ca are open .",
    "this result has many interesting consequences over the dynamical behavior .",
    "for example , quasi - expansive 2d ca turn out to be open ( corollary  [ cor : quasiexp - dpo - surj - op ] ) . as in  @xcite ,",
    "most of these results have been obtained using the slicing construction , confirming it as a powerful tool for the analysis of 2d ca dynamics .",
    "we stress that , even if the constructions are of help for proving 1d  like results , most of the proofs differ significantly from their 1d counterparts . in section  [ sec : closund ] , we prove that closingness ( and some other related to it ) is undecidable in the 2d case ( theorem  [ th : closingundec ] ) .",
    "remark that this results corrects an error made in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath1 ) due to a wrong use of the property characterizing closing ca ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath0 ) ) . recalling that closingness is decidable in dimension 1 ( see  @xcite ) , we have just added one more item to the slowly growing collection of dimension sensitive properties ( see  @xcite for other examples ) . moreover , the proof technique used for theorem  [ th : closingundec ] generalizes classical kari s construction  @xcite which uses tiling and plane - filling curves .",

    "the goal is to build a pattern @xmath430 of shape more or less close to a parallelogram of vectors @xmath109 and @xmath267 , such that it is possible , with @xmath430 , to tile the plane periodically with periods @xmath109 and @xmath267 .",

    "the figure [ figapp1 ] represents a segment @xmath311 , its approximation @xmath465 and the two bounds .      now , consider a parallelogram @xmath468 ( we stress that this transformation can be made for any polygons with integer coordinate ) of vectors @xmath109 and @xmath267 . and denote by @xmath469 and @xmath20 its four sides . without loss of generality we can assume that the vertexes of @xmath468 are all at distance at least @xmath470 in both vertical and horizontal directions . indeed ,",
    "if this is not the case , one can find the first integer @xmath153 such that the parallelogram of vectors @xmath471 and @xmath472 has this property and make the same reasoning .",
    "the integer approximation @xmath430 of the parallelogram @xmath468 is the polygon whose sides are the integer upper bounds @xmath473 and @xmath474 of the sides @xmath469 and @xmath20 .",
    "we note that it is possible that at a corner , if the angle between two sides of @xmath468 is too little , that an overlapping between two sides of its approximation @xmath430 appears . in this case , we just suppress the overlapping part to preserve the path - connected property .",
    "the suppression of this part does not affect the properties of @xmath430 .",
    "the only difference is the following : in a periodic tiling with this shape , any pattern have @xmath432 neighboring patterns rather that four in the case of no overlapping sides .",
