    "<S> belyaev s ideas associated with the condensate state in bose interacting systems have stimulated intensive studies of the possible manifestation of such a condensation in fermi systems . in many fermi systems and compounds at zero temperature a phase transition happens that leads to a quite specific state called fermion condensation . </S>",
    "<S> as a signal of such a fermion condensation quantum phase transition ( fcqpt ) serves unlimited increase of the effective mass of quasiparticles that determines the excitation spectrum and creates flat bands . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the class of fermi liquids with the fermion condensate forms a new state of matter . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the phase diagrams and the physical properties of systems located near that phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> a common and essential feature of such systems is quasiparticles different from those suggested by l. d. landau , by crucial dependence of their effective mass on temperature , external magnetic field , pressure etc . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that a huge amount of experimental data collected on different compounds suggests that they , starting from some temperature and down , form the new state of matter , and are governed by the fermion condensation . </S>",
    "<S> our discussion shows that the theory of fermion condensation develops completely good description of the nfl behavior of strongly correlated fermi systems . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the fermion condensation can be considered as the universal reason for the nfl behavior observed in various hf metals , liquids , compounds with quantum spin liquids , and quasicrystals . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these systems exhibit universal scaling behavior of their thermodynamic properties . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the quantum critical physics of different strongly correlated compounds is universal , and emerges regardless of the underlying microscopic details of the compounds . </S>",
    "<S> this uniform behavior , governed by the universal quantum critical physics , allows us to view it as the main characteristic of the new state of matter . </S>"
