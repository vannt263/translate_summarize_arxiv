    "satellites in inclined circumplanetary orbits that are subject to gravitational perturbations from the sun can undergo large - amplitude eccentricity oscillations through the kozai mechanism @xcite , often with catastrophic results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed below , such dramatic increases of eccentricity can occur as the pericenter slows its precession , allowing the solar tugs to systematically remove angular momentum from the orbit over part of the precession cycle .",
    "when the dominant perturbation is the sun s gravity , this halting of the pericenter can only be achieved for highly inclined orbits ( @xmath2 ) . in this paper",
    "we consider situations where additional perturbations are also important , thereby providing new ways to slow pericenter precession and to consequently generate large eccentricities .",
    "an important additional potential to consider is that due to the central planet s oblateness .",
    "the study of this perturbation s effect on satellites in combination with the sun s gravity dates back to investigations of saturn s moon iapetus by @xcite , and later , by @xcite . @xcite subsequently generalized this analysis to an arbitrary number of perturbers .",
    "these works were limited to circular satellite orbits , for which the motion can be expressed in terms of elementary functions . in the general case of eccentric orbits , however , the evolution is no longer integrable . in the special circumstance where the obliquity is zero , @xcite ,",
    "found a class of solutions where the argument of pericenter librates around @xmath3 , qualitatively similar to kozai cycles .",
    "@xcite tabulate and explore the integrable cases in the problem .",
    "@xcite and @xcite built on these works and discovered solutions where most or all of the orbital elements remained stationary . however , they limited their analysis to low obliquities , applicable to the earth - moon system .",
    "@xcite , henceforth ttn , analyzed the full range of obliquities and found the stationary solutions for both circular and eccentric orbits .",
    "they further provide maps of the stability of these equilibria to eccentricity and angular momentum perturbations .",
    "most importantly for this paper , they discovered that orbits around planets with obliquities @xmath4 undergo chaotic , large - amplitude oscillations in eccentricity and in inclination over the radial range from the planet where the two perturbations are comparable ( see fig . 9 in * ? ? ?",
    "for a visualization of the effect , see the orbital histories shown in the figures below .    in this paper",
    ", we first investigate this case ( including oblateness and gravitational solar perturbations ) in a manner complementary to ttn .",
    "we use orbital elements in preference to ttn s vector approach , and we derive our results from the simple condition that the pericenter be able to halt , rather than from the stability of the laplace surface . we thereby sacrifice some mathematical elegance and generality in order to provide a more physically intuitive picture . in section [ 3d ]",
    "we extend the work of ttn , which only considers orbits in the equilibrium plane , to consider the general case of orbits inclined to this laplace plane .",
    "although each added perturbation greatly increases the system s complexity , in section [ em ] we incorporate radiation pressure so as to be able to study the motion of dust grains , for which such forces matter @xcite .",
    "most importantly , radiation forces generate poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag .",
    "p - r drag causes an orbit s semimajor axis to decay @xcite , allowing it to sweep through the radial range from the planet in which the eccentricity becomes unstable .",
    "we investigate whether radiation pressure s additional effects alter this unstable radial range or are even capable of stabilizing particle orbits against the instability found by ttn .",
    "we start by reviewing the features of the kozai mechanism that are essential to our work in order to motivate the strategy pursued in the rest of the paper . in our context",
    ", kozai oscillations result solely from the sun s gravitational perturbations on a body in an inclined circumplanetary orbit .    from a planetocentric perspective , the sun ",
    "orbits \" the planet in the latter s orbital plane ; to avoid confusion with the particle s orbital plane , we will hereafter refer to the planet s orbital plane as the  ecliptic \" ( even though the latter term strictly refers to the earth s orbital plane ) .",
    "when interested in secular timescales much longer than the planet s and particle s orbital periods , one can time - average over the sun s and particle s orbits and treat their masses as distributions smeared over their paths in the sky .",
    "furthermore , since a circumplanetary particle lies much closer to the planet than to the sun , it is usually sufficient to take only the leading quadrupole term in an expansion of the solar potential in powers of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the circumplanetary particle s semimajor axis , and @xmath7 is the planet s semimajor axis .",
    "we point out , however , that @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have found that including the octupole term can introduce qualitatively different phenomena including flips from prograde to retrograde orbits , and eccentricities arbitrarily close to unity . in the limit where the circumplanetary particle s mass is negligible",
    ", they find that the octupole correction can be ignored when @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the planet s orbital eccentricity . in this paper",
    "we consider only the sun s quadrupole potential , and our results are therefore only applicable to cases where @xmath8 .",
    "the secular problem truncated at quadrupole order was first analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we choose to work with the orbital elements ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the equations of motion in these variables are given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* though see an erratum common to both papers in @xcite ) :    @xmath12 , \\label{dwdt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the particle s mean motion , @xmath14 is the particle orbit s eccentricity , @xmath15 its argument of pericenter , and @xmath16 its inclination to the ecliptic , in which the sun moves .",
    "the subscript @xmath17 has been added to the angular quantities to emphasize that they are measured relative to the ecliptic plane .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 characterizes the strength of the solar perturbation relative to the dominant planetary gravity and depends on the distance from the planet ; it is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the planet s and sun s masses , respectively .",
    "the fact that the sun has been averaged over its orbit and that the potential it creates is therefore time - independent means that energy ( and thus @xmath6 ) is conserved .",
    "furthermore , @xcite realized that the problem s symmetry guaranteed the conservation of the component of angular momentum perpendicular to the ecliptic , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the gravitational constant .",

    "no stationary point exists , and only circulating solutions are possible .",
    "these behaviors can be seen in figs .",
    "2 - 8 of @xcite and fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "more qualitatively , eq . [ dedt ] indicates that the pericenter s orientation within the orbital plane ( given by @xmath15 ) determines whether the eccentricity grows or shrinks .",
    "normally @xmath15 circulates swiftly , as the term in brackets in eq .",
    "[ dwdt ] is roughly constant for small @xmath14 and @xmath31 .",
    "this results in a small - amplitude eccentricity oscillation ( due to the @xmath32 term in eq .",
    "[ dedt ] ) .",
    "however , if @xmath33 ever approaches zero in an orientation where @xmath34 , the eccentricity can grow to large values .",
    "this can occur in the kozai problem whenever the relative inclination , @xmath16 , between the particle s orbit and the distant perturber s orbit is significant . for small eccentricities , eq .",
    "[ dwdt ] indicates that @xmath33 equals zero for some values of @xmath15 when @xmath35 ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) .",
    "large inclinations to the ecliptic therefore provide one way for the eccentricity of circumplanetary orbits to grow to large values ; however , adding other perturbations may allow for additional possibilities .",
    "a planet s oblateness , represented by its @xmath37 coefficient , causes pericenter precession but does not produce secular effects on an orbit s eccentricity or inclination ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one can therefore imagine that orbital configurations may exist in which the @xmath15 precession from @xmath37 cancels that from the sun , making @xmath15 constant and allowing the eccentricity to grow to large values according to eq .",
    "[ dedt ] .",
    "the conservation of @xmath24 mentioned in the previous section is due to the quadrupole potential s azimuthal symmetry , and this causes the eccentricity and inclination evolution to be coupled @xcite .",
    "but when one adds planetary oblateness , which is invariant about a different axis ( the planet s spin pole ) , this symmetry of the classical kozai case is destroyed .",
    "hence , the eccentricity and inclination become decoupled , and the optimal choice of a reference plane from which to measure all angles is no longer obvious .",
    "an appropriate choice is the local laplace plane , which lies between the planet s equatorial plane and the ecliptic . if a particle on a circular orbit has its orbital plane align with this equilibrium plane , the torques from the sun and @xmath37 balance so that the orbit s angular momentum vector remains fixed , and the orbital plane does not precess @xcite .",
    "a circular orbit _ not _ aligned with the local laplace plane will have its orbital axis precess around the equilibrium laplace plane axis ( see fig .",
    "[ precession ] ) .",
    "this represents a compromise between the particle orbit attempting to precess around both the planet s spin axis and the sun s orbital axis .",
    "normal to the local laplace plane @xmath38 lies between , and is coplanar with , the planet s spin pole @xmath39 and the ecliptic normal @xmath40 .",
    "the normal to an arbitrary particle s orbit plane @xmath41 will precess around @xmath38 at approximately constant inclination @xmath31 , sweeping out a cone .",
    "the obliquity @xmath42 is simply the angle between the vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath43 represents the angle between @xmath39 and the @xmath38 axis .",
    "as the semimajor axis changes and the relative strengths of the sun s and planet s perturbations vary , the laplace plane will shift , and @xmath43 will vary.,width=340 ]    more generally , the orbit normals of eccentric orbits will wobble as they undergo their precession cycle since their changing distance from the planet means they  sense \" a range of laplace planes .",
    "we note that even in cases where the _ orbital plane _ itself does not precess , the _",
    "pericenter _ may still precess within that orbital plane .",
    "it is specifically the ability of the _ pericenter _ to halt that gives rise to large eccentricities , as argued in the first paragraph of this section .    because the strengths of the two relevant perturbations vary differently with distance from the planet , the local laplace plane shifts as the particle s semimajor axis varies . near the planet , where the torques on the orbit are predominantly caused by oblateness ,",
    "the laplace plane nearly coincides with the planet s equatorial plane .",
    "far from the planet , where solar torques dominate , the laplace plane aligns closely with the ecliptic ( in which the sun  moves \" ) . between these limits ,",
    "the laplace plane takes on intermediate orientations , generating a warped laplace surface .",
    "the laplace plane at a given semimajor axis is the tangent plane to the laplace surface .",
    "the transition of the laplace surface from the ecliptic to the equatorial plane occurs approximately at the distance where the torques from the solar tides and @xmath37 are equal . omitting factors of order unity ,",
    "this distance is often referred to as the laplace radius and is given by @xcite , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath20 are the planet s radius and mass , and @xmath21 , @xmath7 and @xmath10 were previously defined . for particles orbiting at large distances from any existing inner satellites , one can treat the inner moons effect as a further contribution to the planetary @xmath37 , where ( see , e.g. , ttn ) , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the effective @xmath37 , and",

    "any subsequent references to a planet s @xmath37 in this paper should be understood as the effective @xmath37 that includes any inner satellites contribution to the quadrupole potential .",
    "an important dynamical feature for particle orbits decaying slowly compared to the precession timescale ( e.g. , through p - r drag ) is that the orbital inclination to the local laplace plane remains roughly constant @xcite .",
    "this means that a decaying particle orbit starting far from the primary in the planet s orbital plane ( which coincides here with the local laplace plane ) will have its orbital plane follow the laplace plane as the latter shifts on its way inward toward the planet .",
    "following ttn , we neglect any variations in @xmath50 , as well as the precession of @xmath51 due to the torques on the equatorial bulge from the sun and other planets .",
    "the latter timescale is generally much longer than a circumplanetary orbit s precession period , in which case it can be safely ignored @xcite .",

    "the planet s oblateness spoils this symmetry from the kozai problem because it allows the particle to exchange substantial angular momentum with the planet at pericenter along that previously conserved direction .",
    "note that when the eccentricity becomes large and the particles at pericenter approach the inner moons , the approximation used in our calculations and simulations of treating the inner satellites as a contribution to the planet s @xmath37 is no longer an appropriate assumption .",

    "we also point out that even though the classical laplace plane is defined only for circular orbits , eccentric laplace equilibria also exist ( ttn ) . the circular and eccentric equilibria bifurcate when the circular solution becomes unstable , and a decaying particle - orbit can transfer onto the eccentric - equilibrium track .",

    "this is especially true for particles starting far from the planet and evolving inward through the unstable region ( rather than starting close and evolving outward ) .",
    "the point at which the classical laplace plane becomes unstable ( found above ) is therefore a good proxy for when a circular orbit originally in the laplace plane destabilizes .",
    "by restricting the above discussion to orbits that lie in the local laplace plane , we reduced the dimensionality of the problem to two dimensions .",
    "we now address the general situation where orbits are inclined to the local laplace plane .",
    "then the problem is inherently three - dimensional , and the enlarged phase space makes it difficult to provide detailed general results .",
    "accordingly , we do not pursue a complete analytical theory and instead limit ourselves to a qualitative description of orbital behavior based on our understanding derived from the above analysis as well as various numerical integrations .",

    "we can first gain some insight by investigating the equations of motion relative to the ecliptic plane .",

    "one should therefore expect that , if a circular orbit starting in the laplace plane becomes unstable , any orbit initially inclined to the ecliptic will also destabilize .",

    "the edge of the unstable region therefore shifts by less than a few percent for @xmath139 .",
    "a more complete investigation of inclined orbits is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "the mechanism discussed in this paper occurs when the effects of planetary oblateness and solar gravity balance at @xmath131 ( eq . [ rl ] ) so as to halt pericenter precession .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to consider whether additional perturbations might instead keep the pericenter moving , thereby stabilizing the orbit . while the previous discussion applies to objects of arbitrary size and mass , we now consider radiation forces , which are most important for small dust grains .",
    "radiation forces are of particular interest because they provide a natural mechanism ( p - r drag ) for the semimajor axis of dust - grain orbits to decay in toward the planet and reach the unstable range in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "two further effects that are generally important for dust grains are direct solar radiation pressure @xcite and electromagnetic forces due to the planetary magnetic field @xcite .    at all the solar system s planets except jupiter",

    "this perturbation has been extensively studied , usually by approximating the planetary orbit as circular and averaging over the particle s orbit , which generally changes much faster than the planet s orbital period @xcite .",
    "@xcite found an exact solution under these assumptions in a frame rotating with the sun , employing several changes of variables ; unfortunately , the inverse transformations to the orbital elements that we have utilized are complicated .",
    "we therefore choose to instead work in the same inertial system we employed above and to find approximate equations sufficient for our needs .    upon averaging over the particle s orbit ,",
    "two fundamental timescales remain .",
    "the first is the secular rate at which the orbital elements change ( @xmath151 , where @xmath13 is the particle s mean motion and @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the radiation pressure and planet s gravitational forces , respectively ) ; the second is simply the sun s mean motion about the planet @xmath154 .",
    "the dynamics are set through their ratio @xmath155 , where the factor of @xmath156 results from the exact form of the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "note that since we will later be interested in higher - order eccentricity terms , we have removed the changing factor of @xmath157 from the definition of @xcite so that @xmath158 is constant ( at a given semimajor axis ) .",
    "one can express @xmath158 as @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the radiation pressure coefficient averaged over the central star s spectrum , @xmath161 is the particle density and @xmath162 is the particle radius .",
    "note that smaller particles , with larger surface - area - to - volume ratios , are more affected by radiation pressure ( i.e. , have higher z ) .",
    "however , once particles shrink below the scale of the star s peak emission wavelength , they lose the ability to couple to the radiation field and @xmath160 drops to zero ; this occurs at @xmath163 m for solar - type stars .",
    "if @xmath158 approaches one , radiation pressure pumps a particle s orbital eccentricity to unity , most often resulting in collision with the planet .",
    "this provides a minimum particle size to consider .",
    "however , because @xmath158 increases with @xmath6 , this limit would vary with initial location from the planet .",
    "this is because the importance of radiation pressure relative to the dominant planetary gravitational field increases the farther out one orbits in the primary s gravitational well . for a more detailed analysis of this threshold and the ultimate fate of these grains ,",

    "<S> furthermore , we find that orbits inclined to the laplace plane will be unstable over a broader radial range , and that such orbits can go unstable for obliquities less than @xmath1 . finally , we analyze the added effects of radiation pressure , which are important for dust grains and provide a natural mechanism for particle semimajor axes to sweep via poynting - robertson drag through any unstable range . </S>",
    "<S> we find that generally the effect persists ; however , the unstable radial range is shifted and small retrograde particles can avoid the instability altogether . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this is occurs because radiation pressure modifies the equilibrium laplace plane . </S>"
