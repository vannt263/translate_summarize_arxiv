    "several diagnostic methods have been used to measure star formation rates ( sfrs ) in galaxies , of which some of the most extensive are the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum ( 1500 - 2800  ) , h@xmath0 recombination line , [ o ii]@xmath2 forbidden line , and the far - ir luminosity .",
    "these various sfr indicators are differently affected by dust extinction and by metallicity effects , and they are related to the emission of different stellar populations , leading to discrepancies between the corresponding sfrs measurements even after extinction corrections . therefore , in order to make a reliable study of the global star formation history of the universe , it is necessary to use the same sfr tracer from low to high redshifts , or to have good calibrations between different indicators .    the h@xmath0 luminosity is an excellent direct tracer of the `` instantaneous '' sfr , it is immune to metallicity effects , and dust obscuration affecting h@xmath0 can be mitigated by reddening correction .",
    "h@xmath0 has been a common sfr tracer in low-@xmath3 surveys , but at moderate redshifts there are only small statistical galaxy samples with h@xmath0 measurements ( e.g.  glazebrook et al .",
    "1999 ; tresse et al .",
    "2002 ; erb et al .  2003 ; doherty et al .  2004 ; shapley et al .  2005 ) . at @xmath4 h@xmath0",
    "is redshifted into the near - ir ( nir ) , where the high sky background entails the need of large total exposure times to obtain good spectral data of faint objects . only with the recent development of multi - object nir spectrographs we are able to obtain h@xmath0 spectra of a significant number of high-@xmath3 galaxies in realistic observing periods .",
    "the goals of the liris - egs project are to probe the star formation history of the universe at @xmath1 using h@xmath0 luminosities as sfr indicators , to obtain self - consistent redshift - one sfr calibrations between h@xmath0 and other star formation tracers , and to complete this study with galaxy stellar masses , morphologies , metallicities and reddening estimations .",
    "this project is possible thanks to the multi - slit mode of the nir spectrograph liris ( long - slit intermediate resolution infrared spectrograph ) , which allows simultaneous observations of about 15 galaxies , and thanks to the collaboration with the egs teams . in this work we present the results of a pilot study where we wanted to probe the multi - slit capabilities of liris at the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) to study the sfr properties of galaxies at @xmath1 from h@xmath0 spectroscopy .",
    "the cosmology @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 is assumed throughout .",
    "the sample of galaxies was drawn from the deep2 redshift survey @xcite , and they are objects for which we expected to find h@xmath0 emission in the j - band , inferred from the presence of [ o ii ] in emission in the deep2 keck optical spectra . we pre - selected galaxies with redshifts in the range @xmath9 such that h@xmath0 will appear in regions of good atmospheric transmission , with good quality of the redshift estimations ( 90% reliable ) , and with [ o ii]@xmath103727 rest - frame equivalent widths larger than 20  .",
    "we did not apply a selection criterion based on oh sky lines to study how the presence of these lines near h@xmath0 affects its detection .",
    "the final selection consists of six deep2 @xmath1 galaxy targets within the @xmath11 arcmin@xmath12 liris field of view centred at ra=@xmath13 , dec=344348(j2000 ) .",
    "the liris multi - slit mask designed to observe these objects also includes holes for two acquisition stars .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were carried out on 2005 june 22 with the multi - object mode of liris at the 4.2-m wht .",
    "liris is a nir ( 0.9 - 2.4 ) intermediate resolution spectrograph , with a hawaii - ii detector cooled at @xmath14 70 k , and a pixel scale of 0.25 arcsec @xcite .",
    "we used a zj grism and a slit width of 0.9 arcsec , yielding a dispersion of 6  per pixel , and a resolution @xmath15 . during the observations",
    "the telescope was nodded between three positions along the slit , with a separation of 4 arcsec between contiguous positions .",
    "the total exposure time was 3.5 hours divided into 7 series of three 600 sec exposures , ensuring that we are limited by photon noise .",
    "our spectroscopic reduction includes a first order `` extra - sky subtraction '' process , and wavelength and flux calibration .",
    "no dark or flat - field corrections were performed . in the first case",
    "the reason is the low temperature of the liris detector , while the second decision was made on the basis of the noisier results found after this correction , due to the absence of continuum in the galaxy spectra .",
    "the reduced emission line spectra are shown in [ fig : multispec ] .",
    "we measured the h@xmath0 integrated fluxes , associated errors , and fwhms , by interactively fitting gaussian functions to the background - subtracted emission - line profiles using the package _ fitlines _ under iraf @xcite .",
    ", width=385 ]",
    "we find four clear h@xmath0 detections with s / n @xmath16 4 ( galaxies 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 ) , and another 3-@xmath17 detection ( galaxy 6 ) , out of the six observed galaxies .",
    "only the two galaxies with h@xmath0 emission away from sky lines have fwhms greater than or similar to the instrumental resolution .",
    "this result highlights the importance of a target selection criterion based on the distance between h@xmath0 and intense oh skylines , which has been included in the selection of the new liris - egs sample .",
    "we obtained the h@xmath0 luminosities , @xmath18 , of the galaxies and derived sfrs using the @xcite conversion ( 2 ) .",
    "as our galaxies have redshifts near unity , we directly derived uv luminosity densities , @xmath19(2200  ) , from the deep2 b magnitudes ( ab ) as a good first approximation .",
    "we also derived uv sfrs using the @xcite conversion ( 1 ) .",
    "these magnitudes are summarized in [ tab : tbl_1 ] together with the deep2 identification numbers and redshifts ( @xmath20 ) of the galaxies , and redshifts derived from liris h@xmath0 detections ( @xmath21 ) . in [ fig : luvha ] we plot the h@xmath0 versus uv luminosities of our galaxies and of three @xmath1 deep2 galaxies from @xcite .",
    "our non - extinction corrected sfrs inferred from h@xmath0 are smaller than the corresponding uv sfrs in all cases except one , and the same result is found for the @xcite galaxies .",
    "other studies of the uv - h@xmath0 sfr relation ( e.g.  glazebrook et al .  1999 ; doherty et al .",
    "2004 ) had found opposite results , with understimations of the uv sfrs by a factor of 2 or 3 from not extinction - corrected data .",
    "one of the reasons for this discrepancy is that four of the h@xmath0 lines in our spectra are affected by the subtraction of very intense oh sky lines , which could reduce the h@xmath0 fluxes .",
    "also , the galaxies appear to be extended in the i - band deep2 images , with a mean fwhm of 1.4 arcsec , so we need to apply aperture corrections to make up for our 0.9 arcsec wide slits .    even though final results are not achieved , with this pilot study we have demonstrated that liris is highly suitable for obtaining h@xmath0 spectroscopy of a significant number of @xmath1 star - forming galaxies . with the upcoming liris - egs sample",
    "we will have a comprehensive dataset that includes not only h@xmath0 and uv continuum information , but also [ o ii ] and far - ir luminosities , stellar masses , reddening estimations , galaxy morphologies and metallicities .",
