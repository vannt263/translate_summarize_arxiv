    "there are presently three evidences for the big - bang model : the universal expansion , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and primordial or big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . the third evidence for a hot big - bang comes , indeed , from the primordial abundances of the `` light elements '' : @xmath0he , d , @xmath1he and @xmath2li .",
    "they were produced during the first @xmath620 minutes of the universe when it was dense and hot enough for nuclear reactions to take place .",
    "these primordial abundances are compared to astronomical observations in primitive astrophysical sites .",
    "it is worth reminding that big bang nucleosynthesis  has been essential in the past , to first estimate the baryonic density of the universe , @xmath7  g / cm@xmath1 @xcite , and give an upper limit on the number neutrino families @xmath9@xcite , both in the seventies .",
    "the number of light neutrino families is now known from the measurement of the @xmath10 width by lep experiments at cern : @xmath11 = 2.9840@xmath120.0082  @xcite .",

    ", they are normalized to the experimental value for the lifetime of the neutron .",
    "its precise value is still a matter of debate @xcite @xmath13 = 880 - 884  s , but its uncertainty has only marginal effect on bbn . the last parameter to have been independently determined is the precise value of baryonic density of the universe , which is now deduced from the observations of the anisotropies of the cmb radiation .",
    "it is usual to introduce @xmath14 , the number of photons per baryon which remains constant during the expansion , and is directly related to @xmath15  by @xmath16=3.65@xmath17 with @xmath18 ( `` wmap only seven year mean '' @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 represents the hubble constant ( @xmath20 ) in units of 100  km / s / mpc ( i.e. @xmath19= 0.704 @xcite ) and @xmath15@xmath21 the baryonic density relative to the _ critical density _",

    "it may appears that big bang nucleosynthesis  studies are now useless , but this is certainly not the case .",

    "observations of @xmath3li  in a few halo stars have renewed the interest for this isotope and the nuclear uncertainties concerning its production .",
    "the evolution of the first generation ( population iii ) of stars could be influenced by the amount of primordial cno elements , as hydrogen burning can proceed either through the slow p ",
    "p chain , or through the more efficient cno cycle .",
    "we will hence review the nuclear aspects of the primordial production of element up to oxygen .",
    "during the evolution of the galaxy , complex nucleosynthesis takes place , mainly in massive stars which release matter enriched in heavy elements into the interstellar medium when they explode as supernovae .",
    "accordingly , the abundance of heavy elements in the gas , at the origin of star formation , increases with time .",
    "the observed abundance of _ metals _ ( in astrophysics , the chemical elements beyond helium ) is hence an indication of its age : the oldest stars have the lowest metallicity . to derive the most primitive abundances one has first , to extract them from observations of astrophysical sites which are thought to be non evolved and second ,",
    "extrapolate them to zero metallicity .",
    "primordial lithium abundance is deduced from observations of low metallicity stars in the halo of our galaxy where the lithium abundance is almost independent of metallicity , displaying a plateau @xcite .",
    "this constant li abundance is interpreted as corresponding to the bbn ,   yield .",
    "this interpretation assumes that lithium has not been depleted at the surface of these stars so that the presently observed abundance is supposed to be equal to the initial one .",
    "the small scatter of values around the `` spite plateau '' is an indication that depletion may not have been very effective .",
    "astronomical observations of metal poor halo stars have led to a relative primordial abundance @xcite of : @xmath25    note also that observationally challenging detections of @xmath3li  has been reported @xcite to a level of @xmath26 below the spite plateau value .",

    "its most primitive abundance is determined from the observation of absorption lines in clouds at high redshift , on the line of sight of more distant quasars .",
    "very few observations of these cosmological clouds are available and a weighted mean @xcite ( and references therein ) of this data yields a d / h abundance of : @xmath27    after bbn , @xmath0he  is produced by stars . its primitive abundance is deduced from observations in hii ( ionized hydrogen ) regions of compact blue galaxies .",
    "galaxies are thought to be formed by the agglomeration of such dwarf galaxies which are hence considered as more primitive .",
    "the primordial @xmath0he  abundance @xmath28 ( @xmath0he  mass fraction ) is given by the extrapolation to zero metallicity but is affected by systematic uncertainties such as plasma temperature or stellar absorption . using the data compiled in ref .",

    "unlike in other sectors of nuclear astrophysics , nuclear cross sections have usually been directly measured at bbn energies ( @xmath31100  kev ) .",

    "the weak reactions involved in n@xmath32p equilibrium are an exception ; their rates @xcite come from the standard theory of the weak interaction , normalized to the experimental neutron lifetime . until very recently ,",
    "the averaged value of 885.7@xmath120.8  s was recommended by the particle data group , but new measurement lead to significantly lower values .",
    "while it has not yet been possible to solve this discrepancy @xcite , a reevaluation of the recommended value : 880.1@xmath121.1  s has been proposed @xcite , awaiting experimental clarification .    the @xmath33h(n,@xmath34h cross section is also obtained from theory @xcite but in the framework of effective field theory .",

    "<S> primordial nucleosynthesis , or big bang nucleosynthesis  ( bbn ) , is one of the three evidences for the big - bang model , together with the expansion of the universe and the cosmic microwave background . </S>",

    "<S> this comparison was used to determine the baryonic density of the universe . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> it is now superseded by the analysis of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> however , there remain , a yet unexplained , discrepancy of a factor 35 , between the calculated and observed lithium primordial abundances , that has not been reduced , neither by recent nuclear physics experiments , nor by new observations . </S>",
    "<S> we review here the nuclear physics aspects of bbn for the production of @xmath0he , d , @xmath1he and @xmath2li , but also @xmath3li , @xmath4be , @xmath5b  and up to cno isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> these are , for instance , important for the initial composition of the matter at the origin of the first stars . </S>",
    "<S> big - bang nucleosynthesis , that has been used , to first constrain the baryonic density , and the number of neutrino families , remains , a valuable tool to probe the physics of the early universe , like variation of `` constants '' or alternative theories of gravity . </S>"
