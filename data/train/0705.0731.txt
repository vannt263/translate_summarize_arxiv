    "the proposed of enhancement of nonlinear optical response from the quantum confined wannier - mott excitons ( we ) by means of resonant hybridization with organic frenkel excitons ( fe ) was first stated in the works of @xcite .",
    "the _ dipole - dipole _ hybrid ( ddh ) is an appropriate coherent linear combination of large radius @xmath3 of the order of @xmath4 _ dipole allowed _ we and small radius but big oscillator strength @xmath5 _ dipole allowed _ fe .",
    "the new hybrid is characterized by big oscillator strength and small saturation density ( strong coupling regime ) .",
    "the expected hybrid optical nonlinearities are large because the ideal bosonic approximation starts to break down at the density of the hybrid close to the saturation density .",
    "close to the saturation , due to overlapping between exciton wave functions , they exhibit rather strong exchange interaction and space filling factor .",
    "compared to the bare we nonlinear response , the hybrid response is enhanced roughly by the factor of the ratio of the fe and we oscillator strength .    in our recent work @xcite we demonstrated formation of a new type of the hybrid .",

    "well and fe in an organic composite called dcm2:ca : ps . for the details on the organic see works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fe formed on the dcm2 molecules is brought dynamically into resonance with the we in the quantum well by means of `` solid state solvation '' [ @xcite ] mechanism .",
    "the _ quadrupole - dipole _ hybridization ( qdh ) is of the same order of magnitude ( @xmath1 ) as that of the ddh : the small oscillator strength of the @xmath0 quadrupole exciton [ @xcite ] is compensated by its strong spacial dispersion .",
    "this qdh exhibits the key features of big oscillator strength and narrow line width .    in the present work we utilize the properties of the hybrid to enhance and modify nonlinear effects associated with the wm part of the hybrid . due to the small radius of the @xmath0 quadrupole",
    "@xmath6 @xmath7 the hybrid may achieve bose condensation before it reaches the critical bulk density . therefore ,",
    "density dependent optical non - linearities which were important in the ddh case are negligibly small for the qdh .",
    "hence , we focus our attention on another nonlinear optical phenomena generic to the cuprous oxide , namely , the photo - thermal bi - stability effect .    the photo - thermal bi - stability effect [ @xcite ] manifest itself for the density of the pumping laser as small as @xmath8 . due to weak interaction with acoustic phonons the energy of the",
    "we will experience a red shift linear with the temperature [ @xcite ] .",
    "the laser heating is balanced by the surrounding helium cooling .",
    "hence , the resulting temperature on the interface is described by a nonlinear equation with more than one solution for some values of the laser detuning from the resonant energy level .",
    "this results in a hysteresis - like pattern for the temperature and absorption .",
    "we have shown that the fact of hybridization with the organic enlarges the bi - stability region from @xmath9 for the bulk cuprous oxide to the order of @xmath1 for the hybrid due due to its large oscillator strength .",
    "another remarkable effect of the hybridization is that the qdh exciton induces multiple highly asymmetrical photo - thermal bi - stability effects associated with two dispersion branches of the hybrid .",
    "the effective absorption maximum for the lower branch of the qdh exciton experiences a red shift of the order of @xmath1 and strongly depends on the pumping intensity .    in the next section",
    "we propose a nonlinear absorption experiment and we give an appropriate mathematical model to observe the hybrid bi - stabilty .",
    "our last section is devoted to discussion of the numerical results following from our model , and comparison with reported results for the bulk cuprous oxide [ @xcite ] .",
    "our proposed configuration is shown in the following diagram ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) . for",
    "the nonlinear absorption experiment let us consider a mono - layer of cuprous oxide placed upon a thin film of an organic compound we take the layer width @xmath10 approximately equal to the size of a unit cell @xmath11 .",

    "one stationary laser ( probe ) is tuned around the @xmath0 quadrupole transitions in the cuprous oxide @xmath12 ( we ) .",
    "the pumping laser pulses of intensity @xmath13 and energy @xmath14 allow dcm2 molecular excitations .",
    "we consider the molecular excitation as a frenkel exciton ( fe ) .",
    "therefore it can be viewed as a 2d lattice of dipoles @xmath15 @xcite placed at @xmath16 .",
    "after the pumping pulse the fe experiences a red shift linear with the ca concentration due to non - resonant frster energy transitions to the ca molecules ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "quantum well provides the @xmath0 _ quadrupole _ we .",
    "the dcm2 part of the organic `` solid state solute '' provides _ dipole _ allowed fe ; the ps host prevents wave function overlapping between organic and inorganic excitons ; ca under proper concentration allows tuning of the excitons into resonance.,width=302 ]    to achieve the red spectral shift of the fe into the resonance with the quantum confined we , one has to adjust the ca concentration to @xmath17 [ @xcite ] . to avoid complicated problems of the dynamics of the hybridizaton",
    "we assume that the fe and we are in exact resonance once the dcm2 enrgy is in close proximity to the we enrgy @xmath18 .",
    "now , we introduce the quadrupole - dipole coupling parameter [ @xcite ] : @xmath19 here @xmath20 , @xmath3 are the bohr radius of the fe and we ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the corresponding bulk dielectric constants of the organic and cuprous oxide .",
    "the quadrupole transition matrix element @xmath23 may be estimated from the corresponding bulk oscillator strength @xmath24}=3.6\\times10^{-9}$ ] via the following identity [ @xcite ] : @xmath25 here the energy gap of cuprous oxide is denoted as @xmath26 taken at @xmath27 of surrounding helium ; @xmath28 represents the effect of the quantum confinement , and @xmath29 .",
    "the maximum value of the coupling parameter is about @xmath30 and for the hybridization to be effective it must be of the same order of magnitude as the dissipative width of the hybrid @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that the cuprous oxide has purity of @xmath32 with the reported line - width of @xmath33 i.e. pico - second lifetime [ @xcite ] while the fe life - time is of the order of @xmath34 . in this case the hybrid life - time is dominated by its inorganic part @xmath35",
    ".    the hybridization will strongly affect the absorption of the probe laser and consequently , it will also modify the photo - thermal bi - stability characteristics of the cuprous oxide . to study this effect , let us assume that the whole system is placed into helium bath with the temperature @xmath36 .",
    "the temperature of the exciton gas @xmath37 at the interface between the organic and inorganic is determined by the balance between the photo - thermal heating due to the exciton absorption and the cooling by the helium bath .",
    "we will assume that the exciton gas is in equilibrium with the helium bath ( thermalization ) .",
    "for thermalized excitons one can treat the temperature @xmath37 as just another parameter of the system .",
    "the rate of helium cooling is given by the following linear term : @xmath38 ; the helium thermo - conductivity is denoted as : @xmath39 [ @xcite ] . to find the heating term we derive below a semi - classical expression for the photo - thermal absorption of the hybrid .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written in the rotating wave approximation as following : @xmath40 here @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the detunings of the laser frequency from the fe and we respectively ; @xmath43 is the number of unit cells in the organic ; @xmath44 is the electric field of the incoming light ; @xmath45 and @xmath46 are annihilation operators for the we and fe respectively .    because the frequency of the laser pulses is much smaller than @xmath47",
    ", one can consider the laser field turned on adiabatically .",
    "then , the equations of motion for any operator can be solved in a very straightforward manner .",
    "apply to that operator the unitary transformation that diagonalizes ( [ eq:2_3 ] ) and then introduce an imaginary part to all detunings , positive for creation operators and negative for annihilation operators . since the hamiltonian involves only bose operators and is quadratic , the unitary transformations that diagonalizes it can be obtained in an analytic form .",
    "the diagonalization procedure can be written as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 eliminates the linear terms in @xmath50 .",
    "the transformation coefficients age given by @xmath51 the bilinear cross term @xmath52 can be diagonalized away through a rotation by @xmath53 in the fe - we coordinate space [ @xcite ] of the form : @xmath54 the overall diagonalized hamiltonian has the form : @xmath55 the factors in front of number operators @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) represent the upper branch and lower branch of the hybrid at exact resonance between fe , we and the photon @xmath58 .",
    "the dispersion is illustrated on fig.[fig:3 ] [ @xcite ] .        with the use of this unitary transformation ,",
    "the direct contribution of the exciton transition to the induced polarization per unit area of the interface is @xmath59 here the initial state @xmath60 corresponds to the fe exciton , as we neglected the quadrupole - light interaction .",
    "the hybrid life - time is introduced into the expression above through the complex part of the detunings @xmath61 as discussed above .",
    "also , due to the localization of the frenkel non - resonant excitation , we take the fe into account as corrections to the local field . assuming the organic to be an isotropic medium",
    ", one can write total electric field to be @xmath62 the second term represents the local field contribution , where @xmath63 is the background polarizability ( defined by non - resonant excitations in the organic ) , while @xmath64 is the direct exciton contribution to the polarizability corresponding to ( [ eq:2_5 ] ) .",
    "the last equation can be rewritten as : @xmath65 where the lorentz - lorenz relationship @xmath66 has been used .",
    "thus , the local field corrections results in the exciton frequency shift @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "the susceptibility is given by : @xmath68 taking into account that @xmath69 , the absorption coefficient is given by : @xmath70 let us now make an important observation , that this absorption coefficient is fundamentally different from that for the case of the ddh . in case of the qdh",
    ", one has @xmath71 while for a dipole - dipole hybridization they are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "so , when @xmath72 the absorption for the qdh is zero even for a smallest coupling .    for the qdh using the given absorption coefficient ( [ eq:2_6 ] ) , the transmission through the sample of an arbitrary thickness ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) can be written as : @xmath73 here @xmath74 can be viewed as the width of the narrow strip around the interface where the hybridization occurs and @xmath75 is the hybrid absorption length .    due to the big oscillator strength and narrow line width of the hybrid",
    "the absorption length @xmath76 is extremely small .",
    "this is balanced out by the fact that the hybridization occurs only in a narrow strip around the interface between the organic and inorganic .",
    "the rest of the crystal is approximately transparent .",
    "so we can assume that the absorbing region is equal to the bohr radius of the hybrid , i.e. @xmath77 , therefore @xmath78 .",
    "the value of the wave vector @xmath79 is controlled by the oblique angle of incidence for the probe laser .",
    "the `` weak '' interaction of the we in the quantum well with the la phonons leads to a red shift of the semiconductor energy gap and therefore to the red shift of the we band gap [ @xcite ] and does not affect the binding energy of the @xmath0 exciton [ @xcite ] .",
    "hence , for small deviation of the exciton gas temperature from the helium bath temperature one can consider the shift to be linear [ @xcite ] : @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the final temperature change given by the laser heating and helium cooling can be written as : @xmath82 - c\\left [ { t - t_{bath } } \\right]\\ ] ] here the phenomenologically introduced constants @xmath83 and @xmath84 giving the heating and cooling rate , respectively [ @xcite ] .",
    "the transmission ( [ eq:2_8 ] ) depends on the temperature through the detuning @xmath85 according to the equation ( [ eq:2_9 ] ) .",
    "the equilibrium temperature is given by the stationary solutions of the equation ( [ eq:2_10 ] ) .",
    "this will govern the temperature and absorption bi - stability .",
    "the qdh structure offers a more complicated picture of the nonlinear photo - thermal effect then just a slab of cuprous oxide itself . as we now show it is not a mere enhancement of the bi - stability effect but the appearance of two or more well pronounced bi - stability regions in temperature and transmission ( absorption ) spectra . in case of the qdh",
    "the photo - thermal rise of the temperature leads not only to the red shift of the @xmath0 exciton energy band but to an effective breaking of the resonance with the fe and reduction of the hybridization .",
    "many properties of the temperature , absorption and effective dispersion of the hybrid system can be obtained even before a numerical solution for the system of equations ( [ eq:2_9],[eq:2_10 ] ) .",
    "the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq:2_10 ] ) can be visualized as an implicit function of the temperature and detuning ( see fig.[fig:4 ] ) .    .",
    "the coupling parameter is taken to be equal to the line width of the hybrid and the subplot ( b ) corresponds to the stark reduced coupling .",
    "the thick solid curve corresponds to the laser intensity @xmath86 and maximum temperature @xmath87 , and another thin curve stands for the intensity @xmath88 and maximum temperature @xmath89,width=302 ]    the actual temperature of the system depends on the way one changes the frequency of the probe laser . if one lowers the frequency starting from the detuning @xmath30 ( point l on fig.[fig:4 ] ) off resonance , then the system follows the path @xmath90 to assure minimum temperature change with the changing detuning .",
    "if one increases the frequency starting from the detuning @xmath91 ( point r on the fig.[fig:4 ] ) , then the system follows the path @xmath92 .    on the other hand one can consider bi - stability as a possibility for the the system ( [ eq:2_9],[eq:2_10 ] ) to have more then one stationary solution .",
    "this non - linearity grows with @xmath13 . to illustrate the concept it is convenient to plot the heating and cooling rate as a function of the temperature .",
    "then the stationary temperature is given as the intercept points ( see fig.[fig:5 ] ) .    )",
    "is given crossing of the cooling ( straight line starting from the origin ) and the detuning dependent photo - heating .",
    "the figure a)-k ) correspond to the different laser detuning from the low temperature limit of the @xmath0 quadrupole exciton as @xmath93 in units of the damping parameter.,width=302 ]    now let us focus on the different branches of the hybrid .",
    "it is clear from the fig.[fig:4 ] and fig.[fig:6 ] that the response from two branches is asymmetrical .",
    "further on we are going to refer to the lower branch as wannier - like and to another as frenkel - like .",
    "both of them are defined by the interplay between the thermo - induced red shift of the we exciton @xmath94 and the excitation detuning @xmath95 .    indeed , the maximum of the absorption given by the poles of the expression ( [ eq:2_6 ] ) : @xmath96 if the coupling between we and fe is dominant : @xmath97 , then both branches are symmetrical and the maximum of absorption corresponds to the usual hybrid dispersion @xmath98 .",
    "otherwise , strong asymmetry reveals itself .",
    "the case @xmath99 defines the maximum of wannier - like bi - stability , dominated by the temperature induced red shift .",
    "the frenkel - like bi - stability corresponds to @xmath100 and is dominated by the hybridization effect .    for the up - scanned wannier - like branch when the excitation energy @xmath101 catches up with the escaping exciton resonance @xmath102 the actual temperature cut - off ( path @xmath103 on the fig.[fig:4 ] and fig.[fig:5],(l ) )",
    "occurs when the laser heating reaches its maximum @xmath104 . when the excitation energy increases further the absorption reduces and the sample cools rapidly . on the down - scan",
    "the sample is cold even beyond the cut - off energy ( the temperature is close to the lower cross - point on fig.[fig:5],(l ) ) .    in the same fashion",
    "the temperature rises rapidly on the frenkel - like branch ( path @xmath105 on the fig.[fig:4 ] and fig.[fig:5],(b))with a down - scan .",
    "the temperature goes down and the detuning between fe and we reaches its minimum and an abrupt heating occurs . for the up - scan the sample",
    "is heated enough ( close to the upper cross - point on fig.[fig:5],(b ) ) to maintain large detuning between the fe and we but drops down rapidly when the fe and we detuning reaches its maximum @xmath106 ( see fig.[fig:5],(d ) ) .",
    "the bi - stability effect and the temperature rise of the hybrid is greatly enhanced ( @xmath1 ) compared to bulk cuprous oxide itself ( @xmath2 ) mainly due to the fact of gaining oscillator strength from the organic part of the hybrid",
    ".    numerical search for a stationary solution of equation ( [ eq:2_10 ] ) reveals a fine structure of the multiple bi - stability ( see fig.[fig:6 ] , fig.[fig:7 ] ) .",
    "for the up - scan regime the distance between the solution branches @xmath107 and @xmath108 on the fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] can become smaller then @xmath94 and the temperature drops down on the branch @xmath108 .",
    "for the same reason when the intensity is big enough and the coupling between the fe and we is reduced by the stark effect fine structure can appear on the branches @xmath109 and @xmath110 on the down - scan .    .",
    "the coupling parameter is taken to be equal to the line width of the hybrid .",
    "the bi - stability is a result of multiple solutions and reveal itself as a sudden drop or raise in the temperature depending on the direction of the scan.,width=302 ]        the model described above is valid for small temperature raise from the @xmath111 only .",
    "but it can be generalized for bigger temperature change by using a more elaborated non - linear temperature dependence of the we exciton [ @xcite ] and possible effect of the optical phonons [ @xcite ] .",
    "although , when one increases @xmath13 to the point when the density of the hybrid is close to the saturation density then other nonlinear effects due to exciton - exciton scattering and possible condensation start to play a considerable role . such non - linear effects are presently under investigation ."
