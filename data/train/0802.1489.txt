    "the detection of neutrinos from the sn1987a by the kamiokande @xcite and imb @xcite collaborations not only confirmed the basic picture of the core collapse supernovae ( sn ) but also initiated a whole new field of observational supernova astrophysics .",
    "in fact , the observation of sn neutrinos is the unique way , except possibly for gravitational wave detection , to directly probe into the interior of a star which is undergoing gravitational collapse . despite this pioneering observation ,",
    "a precise understanding of the physics of a sn explosion still eludes us .",
    "spherically symmetric models of iron core collapse do not explode , even with solid neutrino transport  @xcite and general relativity  @xcite . in the two - dimensional models the outcomes vary qualitatively and quantitatively  @xcite , reflecting the increased complexity of the physics involved .",
    "owing to their feeble interactions , neutrinos are able to escape from deep inside the star .",
    "therefore sn neutrinos can provide us with information about the highly dense inner layers , where the sn explosion is initiated .",
    "moreover , the composition of the sn core is such that the reactions involved in the creation and annihilation of neutrinos are different for the different neutrino flavors .",
    "these differences are imprinted in the emerging neutrino fluxes .",
    "these are non - thermal and can be characterized by the total energy emitted , the mean energy and the so - called _ pinching _ parameter which controls the width of the distribution .",
    "therefore , a flavor - dependent reconstruction of sn neutrino flux is a useful probe for diagnosing sn core .",
    "( for early references , see e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "the physics which can be probed would include that governing matter under extreme conditions , such as information about the equation of state , and the explosion mechanism itself @xcite .    the potential of neutrinos in probing the sn core results , on the one hand , from the huge flux of them that will be released , corresponding to around 99  % of the total energy emitted in the sn explosion .",
    "on the other hand it is helped ( though it may sound ironic ) by the flavor mixing properties of neutrinos , including the large `` solar '' neutrino mixing angle obtained by kamland  @xcite and the solar neutrino observation , in particular , sno  @xcite .",
    "for an updated global analysis of the data of the various neutrino oscillation experiments , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "if a supernova explosion takes place in our galaxy the number of neutrino events expected in the current and planned neutrino detectors will be enormous  @xcite . among all neutrino detectors water cherenkov detectors are most likely the ones which can run long enough to watch galactic sn over long enough time scales .",
    "it is therefore important to establish a strategy for diagnosing the core of sn by using neutrino observation by water cherenkov detectors .",
    "inverse beta decay @xmath0 provides the main neutrino detection reaction in such a detector .",
    "according to the standard picture of supernova neutrino propagation , except for the case of inverted mass hierarchy and large @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , the energy spectrum of @xmath3 at the earth is expected to be a strong mixture of the original @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( we collectively denote @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 as @xmath4 since at first approximation their properties are identical and can be treated as a single species ) , modulated by the large value of solar mixing angle , @xmath9 , well determined by solar and kamland data  @xcite . by performing a suitable simulation of the high - statistics",

    "it is remarkable that , despite the large difference in the primary neutrino spectra at the sn core particularly for @xmath4 , the true and fake spectra agree with each other within better than 1% level over a wide energy range .",
    "it is evident that the degeneracy is present already in the bare neutrino fluxes reaching the detector ( before taking into account experimental uncertainties such as energy resolution ) and it looks so perfect that it is unlikely to be resolved even with the extremely high statistics expected in a megaton detector  @xcite .",

    "this translates to an ordering of the average energies of sn neutrinos @xmath21 , the exact degree of difference still under debate  @xcite .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for more about physics in the proto - neutron star .",
    "the location of the neutrinospheres does not only depend on the neutrino flavor but also on its energy .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross sections of the processes involved makes neutrinos with different energies decouple from the proto - neutron star at different radii and therefore different local temperatures .",

    "the possibility of reconstructing the flux parameters of the three effective flavors from observation would lead to a `` neutrino imaging '' of the proto - neutron star .",

    "the main consequence of this effect will be an increase of the statistical errors but the main features would remain .    the second aspect that could affect our analysis is the presence of the shock waves propagating within the supernova .",

    "the formation of shock waves could additionally lead to turbulent density fluctuations , causing a neutrino flavor depolarization as discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite where the former considered the @xmath104-correlated density fluctuation whereas the latter considered the kolmogorov - type turbulence implied by realistic sn simulations .",

    ".    the third case where our analysis would not apply would be in the presence of decoherence .",
    "this can be due to the multi - angle nature of the neutrino self - interaction , and can be present for both normal and inverted mass hierarchies .",
    "nevertheless , it is expected to significantly affect the neutrino propagation only for very similar @xmath11 and @xmath10 spectra  @xcite , which does not seem to be the case according to the sn simulations  @xcite",
    ". therefore we will neglect it .",
    "last , but not least , the possible existence of non - standard neutrino interactions , apart from affecting neutrino propagation through the sn envelope , could induce resonant conversions in the most deleptonised inner layers  @xcite with possibly dramatic effects in a megaton water cherenkov detector  @xcite . this possibility will also not be considered here .    before closing this section",
    "let us mention that a similar analysis could be performed in the case of inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "however , in this case one should take into account the possible modulations induced by the shock wave passage , as well as by collective effects such as the spectral split in @xmath10  @xcite or the effect of the second - order difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 refractive index  @xcite .",

    "this is exactly what is seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : keil - keil ] ( left panel in the second row ) and in the bottom panel of fig .  [ fig:1dprojection ] ( red curve ) . in the latter figure",
    "we see how this argument is mainly qualitative , since @xmath131 is not constant over the whole range of the @xmath114 considered .",
    "actually , when comparing this result with the analytical condition ( [ eq : e2av_ob2 ] ) one realizes that this qualitative argument only applies for a definite range of @xmath114 .",
    "once the presence and robustness of the degeneracy have been established , the next step is to point out strategies to solve the problem . here",
    "we comment on three possible directions that could be followed .",
    "first from the theory side we note that a better understanding of the neutrino flux formation would narrow down the range of values that the flux parameters could take . in particular we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : keil - keil ] how our knowledge of the pinching parameter can play an essential role in reducing the uncertainties on the traditionally considered parameters @xmath173 and @xmath174 .    from an experimental point of view",
    "one may correctly argue that the degeneracy we have pointed out is an artifact of our treatment , which uses only the @xmath69 absorption reaction .",
    "the obvious way of resolving such a degeneracy would be to include other reactions into the analysis , such as neutrino elastic scattering off electrons , or cc and nc reactions with oxygen .",
    "indeed , the quasi one - dimensional nature of the degeneracy we found would suggest that it would be lifted by adding an extra high statistics observable , independent of inverse beta decay .",
    "however , the situation in our case is quite different . to understand why",
    ", one must recall the following crucial fact . in order to include the previous reactions one must also include @xmath68 into the analysis . as a result instead of the six supernova neutrino flux parameters used in our fitting procedure we would need nine .",
    "since the number of events due to the above reactions is more than one order of magnitude less than those coming from the @xmath69 absorption reaction , it is not obvious at all that , by adding these other reactions one will indeed resolve the degeneracy we have uncovered . if the degeneracy can not be resolved simply by using water cherenkov detectors one must think of possible alternative detectors to combine with .",
    "for example the situation might improve either by : ( 1 ) adding detectors with better sensitivity on @xmath18 parameters , or ( 2 ) adding detectors sensitive to @xmath68 .",
    "good candidates in the current and near future experiments which can contribute towards these goals would be borexino  @xcite , kamland ( in its future solar neutrino observation phase )  @xcite and halo project  @xcite .",
    "the former 2 detectors will be able to observe proton recoil in @xmath175 elastic scattering in a liquid scintillator  @xcite .",
    "we stress that this would provide a unique opportunity to obtain the spectrum information of nc reactions which should be very important in resolving the degeneracy .",
    "the latter , on the other hand , would have capabilities to detect @xmath18 and @xmath68 through the nc and the cc reactions on lead .",
    "with regard to the possibility ( 2 ) above it would be interesting to consider a high statistics measurement of @xmath11 events in a liquid argon neutrino detector through the charged current absorption of @xmath11 by @xmath176ar @xcite . as can be inferred from eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_a ] ) , the dependence of the @xmath11 flux at the earth on the original @xmath177 and @xmath125 is different from that of antineutrinos .",
    "in particular for _ large _ @xmath1 the following condition holds @xmath178 therefore , one could hope that this fact could break the degeneracy expected in water cherenkov detectors .",
    "nevertheless the possibility of distinguishing between the @xmath11 and @xmath10 signals is in any case non - trivial .",
    "therefore , a realistic nine - dimensional parameter analysis taking into account all neutrino flavors is outside the scope of this paper but should be taken up as a next step .",
    "in this paper , we have reexamined the possibility of reconstructing the initial fluxes of the neutrinos emitted in a future galactic core - collapse supernova by using a megaton - sized water cherenkov detector .",
    "the three parameters that are usually considered to characterize the non - thermal supernova neutrino flux are the average and total energies of each species , and the so - called pinching parameter .",
    "the latter is connected to the second moment of the distribution function and modulates its shape . due to the current uncertainty on its precise value",
    ", we have included the pinching parameter as a fit parameter , in contrast to previous works where only the average and total energies were considered .    in order to illustrate our results",
    "we have considered the following scenario .",
    "first of all , from all reactions giving rise to the neutrino signal in a water cherenkov detector we have concentrated on the inverse beta decay , @xmath0 , which is by far the most important one . therefore , our setting is sensitive only to the anti - neutrino fluxes at terrestrial detectors .",
    "as far as the neutrino properties are concerned , we have focused on the case of normal mass hierarchy neutrinos , neglecting also any non - standard neutrino interactions which could affect neutrino propagation in an important way .",
    "such well - defined scenario is much less affected by uncertainties due to neutrino self - interaction in the inner layers or the distortion of the matter density due to the shock wave passage .    on the other hand",
    "the @xmath10 flux arriving at the earth is in this case a strong mixture of the initial @xmath10 and @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the detected @xmath10 flux would provide us with information not only about @xmath10 but also @xmath4 . under these assumptions we performed a @xmath85 analysis on artificially generated data .",
    "we found that the inclusion of the pinching parameter in the fit analysis has a drastic consequence : the appearance of a continuous degeneracy in the determination of the @xmath4 flux parameters .",
    "this degeneracy is quite robust , as it persists irrespective of the parametrization taken for the neutrino distributions .",
    "this makes very difficult a complete determination of the different parameters characterizing the @xmath4 flux using the inverse beta decay events , even in the case of a megaton water cherenkov detector .",
    "the solution to this degeneracy must come from a better understanding of the neutrino spectra formation , as well as an optimization of the information provided by the complementary neutrino reactions involved not only in water cherenkov detectors , but also in alternative detector techniques .",
    "note added : after completion of our work we became aware of the paper @xcite , which was in fact triggered by previous private communications with us .",
    "their analysis includes other reactions available in water cherenkov detectors .",

    "<S> we reexamine the possibility of reconstructing the initial fluxes of supernova neutrinos emitted in a future core - collapse galactic supernova explosion and detected in a megaton - sized water cherenkov detector . </S>",
    "<S> a novel key element in our method is the inclusion , in addition to the total and the average energies of each neutrino species , of a `` pinching '' parameter characterizing the width of the distribution as a fit parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we uncover in this case a continuous degeneracy in the reconstructed parameters of supernova neutrino fluxes at the neutrinosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze in detail the features of this degeneracy and show how it occurs irrespective of the parametrization used for the distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> given that this degeneracy is real we briefly comment on possible steps towards resolving it , which necessarily requires going beyond the setting presented here .    </S>",
