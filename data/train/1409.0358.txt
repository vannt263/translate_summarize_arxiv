    "<S> in this work , we study the factorization of the radiative leptonic decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , the contributions of the order @xmath2 are taken into account . the factorization is proved to be valid explicitly at the order @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the hard kernel is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are calculated using the wave - function obtained in relativistic potential model . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 contribution is found to be very important , the correction to the decay amplitudes of @xmath4 is about @xmath5 . for @xmath6 mesons , </S>",
