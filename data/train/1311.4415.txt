    "in this paper we study the time optimal control problem for the differential inclusion @xmath2 with a given closed target set @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamics is described by a set - valued lipschitz continuous function @xmath4 , whose values are assumed to be compact , convex and nonempty .    for each trajectory of starting from @xmath5 , i.e. , for each absolutely continuous function @xmath6 satisfying @xmath7 for a.e . @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we set @xmath10 with the convention @xmath11 .",
    "the _ minimum time function _ is defined by @xmath12    when finite , @xmath13 represents the minimum time needed to steer the point @xmath5 to the target @xmath0 following the trajectories of .",
    "the study of the regularity of @xmath1 is a central problem in optimal control theory , and the literature offers a huge choice of papers on such a topic . in particular ,",
    "starting from the seminal paper @xcite , the regularity property of @xmath1 called _ semiconcavity _ was extensively studied and used to deduce new optimality conditions . roughly speaking ,",
    "semiconcavity amounts to the local lipschitz continuity of @xmath1 plus a uniform exterior sphere condition for the hypograph of @xmath1 . using these geometric properties",
    ", one can derive further regularity results for @xmath1 , such as @xmath14 estimates for @xmath1 and @xmath15 , the existence of taylor s expansion of order two around a. e. point , and bounds for the singular sets of @xmath16 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an introduction to semiconcave functions .",
    "semiconcavity ( and semiconvexity ) results , however , rely essentially on a strong controllability assumption  the so - called petrov condition  which is actually equivalent to the local lipschitz continuity of @xmath16 .",
    "when this assumption is removed , @xmath1 may fail to be semiconcave , but it still retains the external sphere property of the hypograph ( or epigraph ) . in @xcite , for parameterized linear multifunctions , the epigraph of @xmath1 was proved to satisfy a strong external sphere condition , which is called _ positive reach property _ in the sense of federer ( also known , in literature , as _",
    "@xmath17-convexity _ or _ proximal smoothness _ ) .",
    "the regularity properties of the class of functions whose epigraph has positive reach turned out to be comparable with the properties of semiconcave / semiconvex functions , we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "the above geometric approach was also generalized to the nonlinear case : in @xcite , the positive reach property of the hypograph of @xmath1 was obtained replacing petrov s condition by the assumption that the normal cone to the hypograph is pointed ( i.e. , contains no lines ) .",
    "without such an assumption , in @xcite , the hypograph of @xmath1 was proved to satisfy a weaker external sphere condition . in the same paper , it was shown that such a condition yields essentially the same regularity properties as in the case when the hypograph has positive reach .",
    "the study of the singular set for @xmath1 , beyond the semiconcave case , was performed in @xcite for the positive reach case , in @xcite for the weak external sphere property , and in @xcite for a further generalized case . in all these papers",
    "the structure of the singular set was analyzed , providing upper bounds for the hausdorff measure of such a set .",
    "lower estimates were obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "so far , all the results in the above papers were proved for a state equation given in the form of a smooth @xmath18-parameterized multifunction .",
    "the smoothness of the parameterization was a crucial issue to gain semiconcavity estimates , and was extensively used in all its generalizations as well .",
    "note that , although a lipschitz multifunction always posseses a lipschitz parameterization ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , it is still an open problem to find conditions for such a parameterization to be smooth .",
    "this motivates a separate study of the minimum time problem for differential inclusions .",
    "the first result in this direction is due to @xcite , where the semiconcavity of the value function of the mayer problem for system was proved . instead of searching for a smooth parametrization of @xmath19 , the main idea of @xcite is to use the smoothness of the hamiltonian associated with system , defined by @xmath20    this approach was extended in @xcite to the study of the minimum time function , still in the semiconcavity framework . a further step to extend this kind of analysis beyond semiconcavity ,",
    "was performed in @xcite , which can be seen as the counterpart of @xcite and @xcite for differential inclusions , proving the external sphere property enjoyed by @xmath21 under milder controllability assumptions .",
    "the main tool used in our analysis is the _ dual arc inclusion _ ( see @xcite ) ,",
    "i.e. , the natural nonsmooth counterpart of the hamiltonian system associated with the problem , that is , @xmath22 if the trajectory @xmath23 starting from @xmath5 at @xmath24 is optimal , then the above system admits a solution when coupled with a terminal condition for @xmath25 that turns out to be a proximal inner normal to the target set @xmath0 at @xmath26 .    in this paper , we prove two results for system : in the first one , we state that the superdifferentiability of the minimum time function @xmath1 along an optimal trajectory is completely determined by the value of the hamiltonian at the endpoint @xmath27 . more precisely , if we are able to find a nontrivial proximal inner normal to the target @xmath0 at the endpoint @xmath26 such that the value of the hamiltonian computed at this inner normal at @xmath28 is nonzero , then the @xmath29-part of the solution of yields a continuous selection of @xmath30 along the trajectory @xmath23 . in particular , we have that @xmath31 for all @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "due to the presence of horizontal normals to @xmath21 , the nonsmoothness of @xmath1 propagates similarly along the flow of an optimal trajectory : indeed we show that , if the value of the hamiltonian computed at this inner normal at @xmath28 is zero , then the same @xmath29-part of the solution yields a continuous selection of @xmath33 along the optimal trajectory .",
    "so , once again , @xmath34 for all @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the second result of this paper , which is a consequence of the above propagation of superdifferentiability , is concerned with the constancy of the hamiltonian along optimal trajectories , which somewhat resembles the classical case . in order to prove this result",
    ", we use the fact that the value of the hamiltonian , at the terminal point of an optimal trajectory , computed at a suitable inner normal , yields the existence of a supergradient of @xmath16 , or of an horizontal supergradient of @xmath16 , at _ all _ points of the trajectory .",
    "this fact forces the value of the hamiltonian , along the solution of the dual arc inclusion , to be identically @xmath35 in the former cases , and @xmath36 in the latter .    a partial converse of the above result , i.e. , a sufficient condition for optimality , is also established in the case of superdifferentiability .",
    "we show that , if we have a solution of the generalized characteristic system @xmath37 along which the hamiltonian is constantly equal to @xmath35 , then the @xmath38-part of the solution is actually an optimal trajectory .",
    "the last part of the paper is devoted to the study of @xmath39 regularity of the minimum time function , which guarantees that the singular part of the distributional gradient of @xmath1 has no cantor component  a property that has several applications to the calculus of variations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "actually , the result we prove is slightly stronger than just establishing the @xmath39 regularity of @xmath1 . indeed ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : sbv ] ensures that , if the subset of @xmath40 at which @xmath41 vanishes for a nontrivial choice of inner normals is _ small enough _ , then there are _ few _ optimal trajectories along which the normal cone to @xmath21 has an horizontal part .",
    "so , at _ most _ points , @xmath42 is bounded and @xmath1 turns out to exhibit a lipschitz behaviour .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : prel ] we fix the notation , and recall definitions and preliminaries from nonsmooth analysis , expecially concerning differential inclusions . in section [ sec : stand ] , we discuss our standing assumptions and recall some useful results from @xcite , while section [ sec : main ] is devoted to the main results of the paper and the analysis of some of their consequences .",
