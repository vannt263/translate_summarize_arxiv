    "@xcite constrained the ifmr using the wide dwd pg 0922@xmath0162 .",
    "these authors compared the more massive wd ( 0.8ex1.10 m@xmath1 ) to similarly massive wds in open clusters for which an initial ( zams ) mass @xmath2 had been published , thereby obtaining @xmath3  m@xmath1  for this wd .",
    "@xcite converted this mass into a pre - wd lifetime of 42@xmath486 myr , to which they added the cooling age @xmath5  of the massive wd to derive a system age of @xmath6 myr .",
    "these authors then used the less massive wd in pg 0922@xmath0162 to constrain the ifmr : they derived a pre - wd lifetime for this 0.79 m@xmath1  wd of @xmath7 myr by subtracting its @xmath5  from the system age , and obtained @xmath8  m@xmath1  for its progenitor .",
    "the @xcite result is one of the most stringent constraints on the ifmr , and is one of the reasons @xcite anchored his semi - empirical ifmr at @xmath9  m@xmath1  and @xmath10  m@xmath1 .    in principle ,",
    "if a reasonable estimate of the system age can be determined from the more massive wd , this method can be applied to _ any _ wide dwd .",
    "the @xcite study has not been widely replicated , however . until recently , there were @xmath1135 known wide dwds ; many of these lacked spectra , and even those with spectra were ill - suited to this analysis because of large @xmath5  uncertainties .",
    "in @xcite we identified 11 new dwds selected by searching for common proper motion ( @xmath12 ) companions to spectroscopically confirmed sdss wds .",
    "this pilot study illustrated the robustness of our method for selecting dwds .",
    "our tests to separate random alignments from high - confidence pairs indicated that wide dwds could be identified without spectroscopy , using sdss photometry and a minimum @xmath12 cut instead . here , we present the findings of our expanded search for dwds in the sdss data release 9 .",
    "we identified 65 systems , bringing the total number of candidate wide dwds to 142 .",
    "we then discuss how spectroscopic follow - up may allow us to use these dwds to constrain the ifmr .",
    "we first searched for dwds by matching proper motions of wd candidates in the sdss dr9 . from dr9",
    "s @xmath13@xmath14 primary photometric objects , we selected those classified as stars that matched our photometric and @xmath12 quality constraints ( @xmath15 mag , @xmath16 mag , @xmath17 mas  yr@xmath18 , @xmath19 mas yr@xmath18 ) . to include both hydrogen - atmosphere da wds and helium - atmosphere db wds in this search , we used a liberal color constraint , selecting those stars with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : dr9_search ] shows the @xmath22 versus @xmath23 colors of the @xmath11@xmath24 sdss objects that met our quality constraints and fell within this region of color space .",
    "our @xmath17  mas  yr@xmath18 criterion should eliminate nearly all qsos .",
    "contaminating main - sequence stars and subdwarfs are more difficult to remove , as these objects may overlap with wds in color and may have @xmath17 mas  yr@xmath18 .",
    "however , wds can be effectively separated from blue stars in a reduced proper motion ( h@xmath25 ) diagram .",
    "the right panel in figure  [ fig : dr9_search ] is h@xmath25 versus @xmath26 for the objects in our sample .",
    "we used the dashed line in the right panel of figure  [ fig : dr9_search ] , adapted from @xcite , to separate subdwarfs from wds , thereby reducing our sample to @xmath1134,000 objects .",
    "next , we searched for @xmath12 matches .",
    "a match occurs when two wds had an angular separation @xmath27 , and , following @xcite , a matching parameter @xmath28 . , where @xmath29 is the difference in @xmath12 in right ascension ( @xmath30 ) and declination ( @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 is the error in @xmath12 .",
    "] we identified 57 candidate dwds , and selected the 36 pairs with @xmath33  as high - probability dwd candidates ; 13 had previously been identified .",
    "we added four pairs at larger @xmath34 but with @xmath35 mas yr@xmath18 ; with such large common @xmath12 these are unlikely to be random alignments .",
    "the number of new candidate common @xmath12 dwds is 27 .",
    "dhital et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "search sdss for photometrically resolved , small @xmath34 pairs of low - mass stars .",
    "these authors identify @xmath134@xmath36 pairs with @xmath37@xmath410@xmath38  and argue that wide pairs can be efficiently identified without having to match @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , @xcite identified a set of wide sdss dwds with @xmath39  based only on photometry .",
    "we began our photometric search for dwds by applying the more stringent color - color constraint described in @xcite to obtain candidate wds : without @xmath12 measurements , subdwarfs and qsos become a significant source of contamination .",
    "@xcite estimated that 17% of the objects falling within this color - color region are qsos .",
    "however , this was based on a @xmath40 mag sample of objects with sdss spectra .",
    "our sample extends to @xmath41 , and we expected qsos to be a more significant contaminant .",
    "we therefore added the additional constraint that objects with @xmath42 should have @xmath43 . of the surviving objects , we selected the 43 pairs with @xmath44  as high - confidence candidate dwds .",
    "five of these were previously known , so that we have 38 new , photometrically selected , candidate dwds .    among the previously known wide dwds",
    "are the 11 systems identified in @xcite and 36 systems identified elsewhere in the literature . to that sample",
    "we add 27 common @xmath12 systems and 38 identified by their small @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite found 53 wide dwds in sdss and spectroscopically confirmed 26 of these ( one additional pair was found to be a contaminant ) .",
    "thirty of the 53 dwds are new , and 11 of these are spectroscopically confirmed . in total",
    ", we therefore have a sample of 142 candidate and confirmed wide dwds , including 19 @xcite new candidate pairs and the 11 these authors have confirmed spectroscopically .",
    "over 13 half nights between 2012 sep and 2013 sep , we observed 34 dwds with the 3.5-m telescope at apache point observatory , nm - m telescope is operated by the astrophysical research consortium . ] with the dual imaging spectrograph in its high - resolution mode ( r @xmath45 at h@xmath46 ) . to these spectra",
    "we add @xmath1130 spectra from sdss ( r @xmath11 1800 ) and @xmath1110 spectra taken with very large telescope ( r @xmath11 15,000 ) from the supernova progenitor survey ( d.  koester , pers .",
    "comm . ) . in total , we have 114 spectra for 97 wds in wide dwds .",
    "our contamination rate by non - wds is extremely low ( 0.8ex5% ) : one target is an a star .    to obtain @xmath47  and",
    "log  @xmath48  for these wds , we used the technique developed by @xcite and described in ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which incorporates model atmospheres for wds with @xmath49 log  @xmath48  @xmath50 .",
    "the observed and theoretical spectra are normalized to a continuum set to unity , and the observed h@xmath46 to h8 lines are fit simultaneously to the synthetic spectra .",
    "we applied the fitting formulas @xcite provide to the @xmath47  and log  @xmath48  solutions to adjust from the standard mixing - length approximation to the 3d simulation results .",
    "next , we used the @xcite models to map our @xmath47  and log  @xmath48  values to @xmath5  and masses ( @xmath51 ) for each of our wds .",
    "our fits also provided distances to the wds , determined by comparing photometric magnitudes with absolute magnitudes from the spectroscopic solutions .",
    "in figure  [ fig : pg0922 ] we reproduce one of the critical steps used by @xcite to constrain the ifmr : the conversion of stellar main - sequence lifetimes into initial masses . because the relation between lifetime and mass is steeper for longer - lived / lower - mass main - sequence stars , even a large uncertainty in the assumed @xmath2 for the more massive wd in pg 0922@xmath0162 results in a stringent constraint on the @xmath2 of the less massive wd .    to adapt this method to a generic wide dwd , we must be able to estimate the @xmath2 of the more massive wd in the pair . instead of comparing to wds in clusters , as was done by @xcite",
    ", we can use the approximate ifmrs provided by stellar evolution codes .",
    "such theoretical relations are imperfect , primarily due to the difficulty of modeling convective overshooting and asymptotic giant branch winds . nevertheless , by varying the different prescriptions for these processes and comparing to simulations from different groups , we can estimate the uncertainty in these theoretical relations .",
    "for the majority of the wd mass range , these uncertainties are large , leading to a wide range for @xmath2 for the more massive wd .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : pg0922 ] shows that even large uncertainties in this estimate can lead to important constraints on the ifmr .",
    "we are in the process of computing sets of theoretical relations with mesa .",
    "we have searched sdss dr9 for wide dwds , identifying 65 new candidate pairs . through our spectroscopic",
    "follow - up campaign , we characterized 32 da / da pairs .",
    "we repeat the analysis of @xcite , who constrained the ifmr using the wide dwd pg 0922@xmath0162 , obtaining nearly identical results .",
    "this method can be expanded to other wide dwds in our catalog . with the future _ gaia _ data release , many more of these systems will likely be identified , therefore refining this method will be important in placing future constraints on the ifmr .",
