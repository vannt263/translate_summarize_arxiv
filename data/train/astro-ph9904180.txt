    "the shape of the universe is presently under investigation , and cosmic crystallography ( cc ) is one of the various methods proposed to determine it @xcite .",
    "the idea which supports the cc method is that if the universe is multiply connected then multiple images of a same cosmic object ( a given quasar , say ) may be observed in the sky .",
    "the separations between pairs of these images are correlated by the geometry and the topology of the spacetime ; so if one selects a catalogue of observed images of cosmic objects and performs a histogram of the separations @xmath2 between the images , then these correlations manifest either as spikes ( associated with clifford translations ) or as slight deformations of the histogram of the corresponding simply connected manifold @xcite .",
    "a variant method was recently proposed by fagundes and gausmann  @xcite , of subtracting from a histogram @xmath3 of a multiply connected space a histogram of the corresponding simply connected space .",
    "the reported result was a plot with much oscillations in small scales .",
    "in the present paper we propose an alternative to fagundes - gausmann method : we derive continuous probability density functions @xmath4 to be subtracted from the histogram @xmath3 , and thereby obtain a histogram sensibly more suitable for analysis .    in section 2",
    "we derive the functions @xmath5 for the euclidean , hyperbolic and elliptic geometries , and in section 3 we make a few comments .",
    "we consider one of the simply connected spaces @xmath6 or @xmath7 . in that space , a spherical solid ball @xmath8 is taken , with radius @xmath9 . the ball is assumed to contain an infinite number of pointlike objects , spatially distributed as uniformly as possible .",
    "we next select pseudorandomly two points of @xmath10 and ask for the probability @xmath11 that the separation between the points lie between @xmath2 and @xmath12 .",
    "* a. euclidean geometry *    in the euclidean three - space take a ball @xmath10 centred at the origin @xmath13 and select two points @xmath14 in the ball ; let @xmath15 $ ] be the radial position of @xmath16 and let @xmath17 be the distance from @xmath16 to @xmath18 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "clearly the probability density @xmath19 of this configuration is proportional both to the area @xmath20 of the locus of @xmath16 well as to the area of the locus of @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath21 this locus is a sphere @xmath22 with area @xmath23 , while when @xmath24 the locus is a spherical disk @xmath25 in @xmath26 with area @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the probability density of the configuration is then @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a normalization constant and @xmath30 is the heaviside function .",
    "we integrate eq .",

    "we reproduce a typical mean pair separation histogram ( mpsh ) for pseudorandomly distributed objects in an euclidean solid sphere @xmath42 with arbitrary radius , together with the corresponding probability density @xmath43 .",
    "it should be stressed that , differently from the hyperbolic and elliptical cases , the shape of the function @xmath43 does not depend on the value of the radius @xmath9 .",
    "* b. hyperbolic geometry *    to obtain the probability density @xmath44 for the hyperbolic geometry we follow the same lines as before .",
    "the area of a sphere with radius @xmath45 is now @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the radius of curvature of the geometry ; without loss of generality we henceforth set @xmath48 . on the other hand ,",
    "the area of a spherical disk @xmath25 in @xmath49 is ( see figure 1 ) @xmath50,\\ ] ] to be considered whenever @xmath24 .",
    "the probability density of the configuration is then @xmath51,\\ ] ] which upon integration for @xmath31 $ ] and normalization gives @xmath52,\\ ] ] valid for @xmath53 $ ] .    in figure 3",
    "we reproduce graphs of @xmath44 for three values of the radius @xmath9 . for @xmath54",
    "the function tends to the euclidean one given in figure 2 , as expected . for increasing values of @xmath9 the function shifts towards the large values of @xmath2 , and for @xmath55 a strong concentration of @xmath44",
    "is found near the extreme value @xmath56 .",
    "figure 4 shows a typical mpsh in the hyperbolic three - space , together with the corresponding probability density @xmath44 .    * c. elliptic geometry *    the basic strategy to obtain the probability density @xmath57 is the same as before , and the calculations are similar whenever the diameter @xmath58 of the ball is less than the separation @xmath59 between antipodal points in the three - sphere ; we then find for @xmath57 the expression , valid for @xmath53 $ ] , @xmath60,\\ ] ] where we have taken @xmath48 without loss of generality .",
    "however , the cases where @xmath61 are considerably trickier to deal with , due to the treacherous connectivity of the spherical space @xmath1 and the new requirement that @xmath2 must not exceed @xmath62",
    ". a much larger quantity of trivial integrations now comes into scene , before the following expression is eventually obtained : @xmath63 ^ 2}\\{[2a-\\sin 2a-\\pi ]                   + \\label{eli2 } \\\\           &    & \\theta(2\\pi-2a - l)\\times [ \\:\\sin\\ ! 2a+\\pi - a - l/2-\\cos\\ !              a\\ : \\sec(l/2)\\:\\sin(a - l/2)]\\}\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] valid for all @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] .    in figure",
    "5 four graphs of @xmath57 are shown , for different values of the radius @xmath9 of the ball . for @xmath9 increasing from @xmath66 to @xmath62 the function continuously shifts towards the smaller values of @xmath2 . in particular , when @xmath67 we have @xmath68 while when @xmath69 we have the harmonic , symmetric probability density @xmath70    in figure 6 a sample mpsh in the spherical space is reproduced , together with the corresponding probability density @xmath57 .",
    "it is perhaps worth clarifying the meaning of the functions @xmath71 : if we pseudorandomly choose two points @xmath16 and @xmath18 in a solid sphere with radius @xmath9 ( see figure 1 ) then @xmath72 is the probability that @xmath16 lies between the radial positions @xmath45 and @xmath73 , times the probability that the separation from @xmath18 to @xmath16 lies between the values @xmath2 and @xmath74 .",
    "the form of @xmath71 clearly depends on the geometry one is concerned with .",
    "each histogram in figures 2 , 4 , and 6 has @xmath75 subintervals and is a mpsh  a mean pair separation histogram comprising @xmath76 comparable catalogues with @xmath77 objects each @xcite .",
    "all computer - generated histograms assume a homogeneous distribution , as described by lehoucq , luminet and uzan @xcite .",
    "a close inspection of figure 2 shows that the most probable separation between two arbitrarily chosen points in an euclidean solid ball is slightly greater than the radius of the ball ; also the maximum of @xmath78 in eq.([euc4 ] ) occurs when @xmath79 , in agreement with plots of fagundes and gausmann @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of the hyperbolic geometries is that at large distances there is more space than in the euclidean geometries ; this fact is clearly exhibited in figure 3 , which shows a strong predominance of large separations @xmath2 when the radius @xmath9 of the solid sphere is large .",
    "it is worth noting that fagundes and gausmann @xcite obtained histograms with @xmath80 which closely resemble ours with @xmath81 in figure 4 .",
    "in contrast , the hyperbolic histograms given by lehoucq _",
    "@xcite use radius @xmath9 nearly @xmath82 , so they are similar to our euclidean one .",
    "oppositely to the hyperbolic case , in distant places endowed with the _ elliptic _ geometry there is _ less _ space than in the euclidean geometry ; this is nicely illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "indeed , with increasing @xmath9 ( increasing solid ball ) the probability of finding small distances @xmath2 ( in comparison with @xmath9 ) also increases .",
    "we further note that when @xmath9 increases from @xmath83 to @xmath62 the ratio @xmath84 recedes from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
