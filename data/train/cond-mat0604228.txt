    "different static and dynamical properties of magnetic nanodisks have been studied recently . in particular , theoretical and experimental studies of the transition between single domain and vortex configurations ( phases ) @xcite give a possibility to conclude , that the vortex state in a nanodisk can exists for the dot diameter in the submicron range , which is much more than the minimum nanoparticle size , currently used in experiments .",

    "such a vortex has lower energy than the opv in a disc , it does not produce surface magnetostatic charges , thus it can provides more stable magnetic bit for the magnetisation storage .    since there exist pure opv for the disk and pure ipv for the ring",

    "we will show in the paper that _ intermediate vortices _ ( imv ) exist in the nanoring when the inner hole is small enough .",
    "for such vortices the magnetisation inside the vortex core has an out  of  plane component , but even in the vortex centre it is not perpendicular to the ring plane .",
    "the presence of the hole in the disk decreases the `` singularity '' in the vortex centre and so it gives an opportunity to realise the vortex state in a smaller nanoparticle .",
    "we will demonstrate that the vortex state can be realised in a nanoring with diameter of few tens of nanometers .    in this paper we provide the systematic study of the magnetic nanoring s ground state .",
