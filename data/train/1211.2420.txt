    "the basic idea for the solar dynamo action was developed by @xcite .",
    "he suggested that the toroidal component of the magnetic field of the sun is stretched from the poloidal component by the differential rotation ( @xmath2 effect ) and the cyclonic motions ( @xmath1 effect ) return the part of the toroidal magnetic field energy back to the poloidal component .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath3 scenario .",
    "this mechanism is implemented in the wide range of the solar dynamo models ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of the turbulence in the mean - field dynamo is represented by the mean electromotive force @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the fluctuating velocity and magnetic fields . in the simplest case",
    "it can be found that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath1 effect , @xmath9 is the turbulent pumping and @xmath10 is the turbulent diffusivity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 effect is a pseudo - scalar ( lacks the mirror symmetry ) which is related to the kinetic helicity of the small - scale flows , i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is correlation time of turbulent motion .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath1 effect is produced not only by kinetic helicity but also by current helicity , and it is @xmath13 .",
    "the latter effect can be interpreted as resistance of magnetic fields against to the twist by helical motions .",
    "it leads to the concept of the catastrophic quenching of the @xmath1 effect by the generated large - scale magnetic field .",
    "it was found that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is magnetic reynolds number ( see , @xcite and references therein ) . in case of @xmath16 , the @xmath1 effect",
    "is quickly saturated for the large - scale magnetic field strength that is much below the equipartition value @xmath17 .",
    "the result was confirmed by the direct numerical simulations ( dns ) @xcite .",
    "the catastrophic quenching ( cq ) is related to the dynamical quenching of the @xmath1 effect .",
    "it is based on conservation of the magnetic helicity , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is fluctuating part of the vector potential ) and the relation between the current and magnetic helicities @xmath20 , which is valid for the isotropic turbulence@xcite .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath21 can be obtained from equations that govern @xmath19 and @xmath6 , it reads as follows @xcite : @xmath22 where , in following to @xcite , we introduce the helicity fluxes @xmath23 .",
    "the helicity fluxes are capable to alleviate the catastrophic quenching ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "generally , it was found that the diffusive fluxes , which are @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the turbulent diffusivity of the magnetic helicity , work robustly in the mean - field dynamo models but it requires @xmath26 to reach @xmath27 .    another possibility to alleviate the catastrophic quenching",
    "is related with the non - local formulation of the mean - electromotive force .",
    "in fact , the babcock - leighton ( bl ) type dynamo is the the special case of the mean - field dynamo with the nonlocal @xmath1 effect .",
    "@xcite found that the nonlocal @xmath1 effect and the diamagnetic pumping can alleviate the catastrophic quenching .",
    "the results by @xcite show that the strength of the quenching can depend on the model design .",
    "therefore , the problem of the catastrophic quenching is actual for different types of the solar dynamo .",
    "recently , @xcite revisited the concept of catastrophic quenching and showed that for the shearing dynamos the eq.([eq : hel ] ) produces the nonphysical fluxes of the magnetic helicity over the spatial scales .",
    "they suggested to cure the problem using the global conservation law for the total magnetic helicity that can be written as follows : @xmath28 where integration is done over the volume that comprises the ensemble of the small - scale fields .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 is the diffusive flux of the total helicity which is resulted from the turbulent motions . ignoring the effect of the meridional circulation we write the local version of the eq.([eq : int - cons ] ) as follows @xcite :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 .",
    "in the paper we employ this equation for the dynamical quenching of the @xmath1 effect in the solar dynamo model and show how it works in the range of the magnetic reynolds number @xmath32 those are typical for the astrophysical conditions .",
    "we study the mean - field induction equation in a perfectly conducting medium : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mean electromotive force , with @xmath35 being fluctuating velocity and magnetic field , respectively , @xmath36 is the mean velocity ( differential rotation ) , and the axisymmetric magnetic field is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the polar angle .",
    "the mean electromotive force @xmath39 is given by @xcite .",
    "it is expressed as follows : @xmath40 the tensor @xmath41 represents the @xmath1-effect , @xmath42 is the turbulent pumping , and @xmath43 is the diffusivity tensor .",
    "the @xmath1 effect includes hydrodynamic and magnetic helicity contributions , @xmath44 the details in expressions for the kinetic part of the @xmath1 effect @xmath45 , as well as @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the contribution of small - scale magnetic helicity @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the fluctuating vector - potential of the magnetic field ) to the @xmath1-effect is defined as @xmath48 the nonlinear feedback of the large - scale magnetic field to the @xmath1-effect is described by a dynamical quenching due to the constraint of magnetic helicity conservation given by eq.([eq : helcon2 ] ) .",
    "the effect of turbulent diffusivity , which is anisotropic due to the coriolis force , is given by : @xmath49 where functions @xmath50 depend on the coriolis number .",

    "qt1@xmath69 as well as in all the qt2 models the parity index saturates to the dipole - like solution . in the qt1@xmath80 models",
    "the asymptotic stage is not clear and they need much longer runs .",
    "the origin of difference in behaviour of the magnetic helicity evolution in the models with qt1 and qt2 has been discussed recently by @xcite .",
    "taking into the dynamo equation ( [ eq : dyn ] ) , the corresponding equation for the large - scale vector potential : @xmath81 where we assume the coulomb gauge , we find the equation which governs the large - scale helicity evolution : @xmath82 therefore , eq . ( [ eq : helcon2 ] ) can be rewritten in form of eq.([eq : int - cons ] ) : @xmath83 the term @xmath84 consists of the counterparts of the sources magnetic helicity , which are represented by @xmath85 , and the fluxes which result from pumping of the large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the sources magnetic helicity in the term @xmath86 are partly compensated in eq([eq : hel-1 ] ) by the counterparts in @xmath84 .",
    "this results in the spatially homogeneous quenching of the large - scale magnetic generation and alleviation of the catastrophic quenching problem .",
    "the last term in eq([ab ] ) contains the transport of the large - scale magnetic helicity by the large - scale flow .",
    "[ fig : snapshots ] shows the snapshots of the magnetic field and magnetic helicity ( large- and small - scale ) evolution in the north segment of the solar convection zone for the model qt2@xmath72 .",
    "we observe the drift of the dynamo waves which are related to the large - scale toroidal and poloidal fields towards the equator and towards the pole , respectively .",
    "the distributions of the large- and small - scale magnetic helicities show the correspondence in sign : positive to negative , and the other way around , respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : helcon2 ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the negative sign of the magnetic helicity follows the dynamo wave of the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "this can be related to the so - called `` current helicity hemispheric sign rule '' ( negative / positive sign of helicity dominate in the north / south hemisphere ) which is suggested by the observations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the origin of the helicity sign rule has been extensively studied in the dynamo theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the similar snapshots for the qt1 model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that for the qt1 model all the changes in the magnetic helicity evolution does not exactly follow to the dynamo wave inside the convection zone as it is demonstrated for the qt2 model .",
    "[ fig : helvar ] shows variations of the radial profiles of the @xmath1 effect and magnetic helicity with the cycle and the time - latitude diagrams for the dynamo model qt2@xmath72 .",
    "for all the models the changes in the @xmath1 effect are concentrated to the top of the convection zone .",
    "this is due to the factor @xmath87 in relation between the current and magnetic helicities .",
    "the difference in the boundary at the top results in different distributions of the @xmath1 effect in the models qt2@xmath69 and qt2@xmath72 .",
    "we would like to notice that the qt1@xmath73 and qt2@xmath69 have the same boundary conditions , however , the resulted distributions of the @xmath1 effect differ drastically .",

    "the same patterns are obtained in the models qt2@xmath88 .",
    "we show the dynamical @xmath1 effect as well .",
    "the model shows that with the boundary conditions given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bc2 ] ) the @xmath1 effect increases and has positive maxima at the growing phase of the cycle and it decreases , having the negative minima at the decaying phase of the cycle .",
    "in the paper we studied the effect of the magnetic helicity conservation in the mean - field solar dynamo model which is shaped by the subsurface shear .",
    "the results show that the solar dynamo can operate in the wide rage of the magnetic reynolds number up to @xmath0 if conservation of the total magnetic helicity is taken into account .",
    "it was found that the boundary conditions for the magnetic helicity influence the distribution of the @xmath1 effect near the solar surface .",
    "for example , the dynamo wave becomes closer to equator when the diffusive flux of the total helicity is zero at the top of the convection zone because the dynamical increase of the @xmath1 effect follows the dynamo wave ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : snapshots ] , [ fig : helvar ] ) .",
    "the situation is opposite for the case when the diffusive flux is dominated by the large - scale helicity .",
    "thus , the parity breaking in the solar dynamo can occur due to perturbations in the external boundary for the magnetic helicity .",
