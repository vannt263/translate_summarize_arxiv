    "obviously , it contains no arc of the unit circle .",
    "this restriction is neither necessary nor sufficient for the convergence of infinite blaschke products or quotients , yet it is inclusive enough to allow the treatment of a wide class of such functions . most of the results we obtained in these papers are expected to be true in some different settings .",

    "however , there is no arc connecting @xmath60 and @xmath179 we need to let @xmath119 vary through negative values up to @xmath120 in order to allow the pre - image arcs starting in @xmath60 and @xmath66 meet each other in @xmath64 ( figure 1(c ) ) . after reflecting them into the unit circle ,",

    "it appears that this figure shows @xmath66 and @xmath60 and @xmath61 as branch points of order four , since there are four arcs converging to each one of them .",
    "but this comes in contradiction with the expression  @xmath45 for @xmath191 according to which they should have order three .",
    "however , the colors of the curves help solve this mystery .",
    "indeed , in every one of these points there are curves of just three colors meeting : red , purple and light blue in @xmath44 and @xmath192 orange , blue and magenta in @xmath60 and @xmath61 and yellow , pink and green in @xmath179 we notice also that in @xmath62 and @xmath193  curves of just two colors , red and green , are touching each other while two curves , one blue and the other green , are passing through @xmath64 and @xmath112 therefore , despite the appearance of @xmath62 and @xmath193 being branch points of order four and that of @xmath64 and @xmath194 being regular points , the reality is that all of them are branch points of order two .",
    "these facts appear more obvious when we inspect the picture 1(d ) .",
    "indeed , there the configurations are the same in @xmath67 @xmath59 @xmath189 @xmath61 and @xmath66 as well as  in @xmath195 @xmath111 @xmath193 and @xmath112 figure 1(g ) shows the projection of the boundaries of the fundamental domains from fig .",
    "1(d ) onto the steiner surface .",
    "when extending the simultaneous continuation over the part of real half axis from @xmath66 to @xmath196 the arcs through @xmath109 @xmath67 and @xmath60 will extend also inside the domains already bounded by them and the unit circle .",
    "the same is true for the domains obtained from them by reflection with respect to the unit circle . in the end ,",
    "some of the fundamental domains appear as having inner boundaries ( arcs whose points are accessible in two distinct ways from the inside of the domain ) , which produce in figure 1(f ) and 1(g ) the `` fractures '' inside some fundamental domains .",
    "we think that the respective fractures are due to the fact that , in this case , mathematica computes separately the values of the function on the two borders , as if indeed they represented different parts of the boundary , and the errors of approximation accumulate differently at the same point producing slightly different values",
    ". there are no real inner boundaries in any fundamental domain of this example .",
    "we obtain a visualization of the mapping @xmath45 by coloring a set of annuli centered at the origin of the @xmath69-plane in different colors and with saturation increasing counter - clockwise and brightness increasing outward ( the saturation is determined by the argument of the point and the brightness is determined by the modulus ) and imposing the same color , saturation and brightness to the pre - image of every point in these annuli .",
    "figures 1(e ) and 1(f ) show the fundamental domains of the mapping ( 4 ) .",
    "the annuli are rendered in figures 1(h ) and ( i ) .",
    "note that in all figures we show only a selection of the annuli whose pre - images are displayed .",
    "a complete collection of annuli can be viewed on the website of the project @xcite .",
    "if the exponent @xmath37 in @xmath52 is negative , or if some of @xmath12 have the module greater than @xmath197 , then @xmath24 is a blaschke quotient . in this case , parts of the interior of the unit disc switch with parts of its exterior when mapped by @xmath24 , yet the unit circle is still mapped on itself .",
    "however , there might be some other curves mapped on the unit circle .",
    "this is the case when in @xmath45 we make one of the following two changes : we replace the factor @xmath198 by @xmath199 or we let @xmath46 @xmath200 first notice that with the notation @xmath45 , we have for any @xmath44 with @xmath46 @xmath201@xmath202^{n}=b_{1/a}(1/z).\\ ] ]    therefore , when the first change is made , we need to solve an equation of the form : @xmath203 and make the same substitution : @xmath101 instead of @xmath154 we obtain : @xmath204    this time we might happen to have @xmath205 for some values @xmath206 with @xmath207 indeed , the equation @xmath208 is equivalent to:@xmath209 which gives:@xmath210 then , for @xmath211 we have @xmath212 where @xmath213 thus @xmath214 these numbers are solutions of the equation @xmath215 therefore they are branch points of @xmath95 and they are situated on the unit circle",
    ". this can happen only if the pre - image by  @xmath24 of the unit circle from the @xmath69-plane contains , besides the unit circle , two other curves passing through these points .",
    "due to the continuity , these must be closed curves on @xmath1 and due to the fact that @xmath24 commutes with @xmath28 , they must be @xmath28-symmetric to each other",
    ". moreover , the equation @xmath216 has all the roots @xmath217 @xmath218 , on the unit circle and on these two curves .",
    "suppose that we have counted these roots in the following way : @xmath219 then we denoted by @xmath220 the root obtained after turning once counter - clockwise around the unit circle in the @xmath69-plane , so that the image  by @xmath24 of the arc between @xmath221 and @xmath220 is that circle , etc .",
    "finally , from @xmath222 we reach @xmath221 again by turning once more around the respective circle .",
    "in other words , the three components of the pre - image of the unit circle from the @xmath69-plane can be viewed as a unique closed curve @xmath223 with self intersections in the points representing solutions situated on the unit circle of the equation @xmath224 the curve @xmath223 is the lifting in the @xmath56-plane staring from @xmath221 of the closed curve obtained by tracing the unit circle in the @xmath69-plane @xmath90 times counter - clockwise .",
    "when performing the simultaneous continuation over @xmath225 , starting from @xmath177 , the arcs we obtain in this way , as well as the arcs determined by @xmath177 on @xmath223 define fundamental domains for @xmath150    if @xmath226",
    "then @xmath227 and the self intersection points of @xmath223 are @xmath228 on the unit circle , which are branch points of order six for @xmath150 obviously , @xmath223 is an @xmath28-symmetric curve ( see figure 2(b ) ) .",
    "the sequence @xmath229 shows how this curve is traced by a point @xmath206 whose image by @xmath24 goes around the unit circle in the @xmath69-plane nine times counter - clockwise .",
    "figures 2(a ) and 2(c ) give the illusion that @xmath206 goes sometimes clockwise ( as , for example , between @xmath220 and @xmath230 since we are tempted to improperly divide @xmath223 in connected components .    finally , when @xmath171 starts taking values less then @xmath231 the curve @xmath223 separates into three disjoint components , one of which is the unit circle and the other two are one interior to the unit circle and one exterior to it ( see figure 2(c ) ) .",
    "these last two components continue to remain @xmath28-symmetric to each other .",
    "in the case @xmath226 the line determined by the points @xmath228 intersects @xmath223 in two triplets of points having the same images by @xmath24 on the unit circle in the @xmath69-plane .",
    "if @xmath206 follows on @xmath223 and on parts of this line the sequence @xmath229 as previously , we notice in all the three cases the following .",
    "the arcs representing continuations from @xmath177 over the real negative half - axis meet in 14 branch points of @xmath150  all these arcs determine 18 domains which are mapped conformally by @xmath24 either on the open unit disc ( _ i - domains _ ) , or on the exterior of the closed unit disc ( _ e - domains _ ) .",
    "every couple of adjacent i - domains , respectively e - domains , is separated by continuation arcs , while every couple of domains of different types is separated by arcs of @xmath223 .",
    "we can combine arbitrarily two adjacent i - domains and e - domains in order to form fundamental domains of @xmath150 the border of every i - domain is obtained by traversing counter - clockwise arcs of @xmath223 determined by consecutive @xmath177 or @xmath177 and a branch point on @xmath232 as well as some continuation arcs between them traversed in any sense , while for the e - domains at least one of the arcs of @xmath223 should be traversed clockwise .    in the case @xmath233 the equation @xmath234 has four imaginary roots @xmath235 thus the corresponding @xmath236 are on the line  passing through @xmath228 and they are branch points of @xmath150 it is easily seen that they are two by two @xmath28-symmetric .",
    "this line is bordering some of i - domains and e - domains visible on figure 2(f ) and ( i ) .",
    "every i - domain is mapped anticonformally by @xmath28 on an e - domain and vice - versa .",
    "the dependence of the configuration on @xmath171 is illustrated on the website @xcite .",
    "to summarize , figure 2 is organized in three columns .",
    "the left column ( figure 2(a),(d ) , ( g ) and ( h ) ) illustrates the case @xmath237 and gives , respectively , the boundaries of the fundamental domains , the preimage of colored annuli under @xmath24 , the preimage of colored annuli in the unit disk and the projection of the boundaries of the fundamental domains on the steiner surface . the middle column ( figure 2(b ) , ( e ) , ( h ) and ( k ) )",
    "illustrates the case @xmath238 and the right column ( figure 2(c ) , ( f ) , ( i ) and ( l ) ) illustrates the case @xmath239 .",
    "some of the colored annuli are shown in figure 3(l ) .",
    "suppose now that  the second change is made in @xmath152 the same conclusion as in the previous example is valid , except that the intervals @xmath240 and @xmath241 for @xmath242  must be replaced by @xmath243 , respectively @xmath244 for @xmath245 this case is illustrated in figure 3 and we notice a striking similarity with figure 2 despite of the fact that the two cases represent blaschke quotients of very different nature .",
    "if both of the previously mentioned changes are made , the formula @xmath246 applies , where @xmath247 @xmath248 this time @xmath24 switches the interior and the exterior of the unit disc , mapping the unit circle on itself , and for @xmath249 @xmath250 we have : @xmath251    in this case , the pre - image of the unit circle is the unit circle .",
