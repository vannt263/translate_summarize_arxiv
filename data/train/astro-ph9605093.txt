    "in their seminal study of dwarf galaxy populations in nearby groups , ferguson and sandage ( 1991 , = fs91 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) defined the early - type dwarf - to - giant ratio ( edgr ) as the total number of early - type dwarf galaxies @xmath5 normalized to the number of early - type giant galaxies , @xmath6 .",
    "for the seven groups which they studied , they determined that the edgr is strongly correlated with the richness of the group , in the sense that it increases monotonically with cluster richness , and appears to be independent of distance from the cluster center .",
    "this correlation should provide insights into both the initial formation of de galaxies , and environmental influences on their subsequent evolution .",
    "an excellent test of the edgr correlation is to extend the analysis to much richer cluster environments than were originally surveyed in the studies mentioned above .",
    "eventually , correlations with other cluster properties ( e.g. , x - ray luminosity , velocity dispersion , bautz - morgan class , substructure ) can then be determined .    in their analysis ,",
    "fs91 calculate the edgr for four different luminosity limits in the range @xmath7 down to @xmath8 . in each case ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 represent a sum of all early - type galaxies above that limiting magnitude : with @xmath10 constant for all cases , the edgr increases for fainter limiting magnitudes .",
    "fs91 assigned galaxies in several nearby groups and clusters into morphological classes using visual inspection from photographic plates . by definition ,",
    "they assign @xmath9 = n(de+de , n+ds0 ) and @xmath10 = n(e+s0 ) . in their analysis ,",
    "the most convincing demonstration of the edgr - richness correlation was obtained by using @xmath11 itself as a measure of the cluster richness .",
    "then a plot of @xmath9 versus @xmath10 shows clearly that the number of dwarfs rises faster than the number of giants : the ratios @xmath12 for fornax and virgo ( abell richness class 1 , two of the richest clusters in their study ) are clearly larger than for leo , dorado and ngc 1400 ( the poorest groups ) .    in a separate study of dwarf galaxies near early - type galaxies ,",
    "vader and sandage ( 1991 ) confirmed the observed correlation for the edgr to increase with environment richness .",
    "they found that giant galaxies in the richest groups are typically @xmath13 overabundant in companion de galaxies when compared to the the mean value of their sample .",
    "in contrast , isolated field galaxies are typically @xmath14 underabundant in de companions relative to the sample mean .",
    "it is worthwhile to note here that the definition of richness used by fs91 and vader and sandage ( 1991 ) differs from the abell richness class .",
    "abell ( 1958 ) defined his `` richness class '' as a number ranging from 0 to 5 , corresponding to the number of counted galaxies which are not more than two magnitudes fainter than the third brightest member .",
    "this scheme allows considerable variation in numbers and densities within individual richness classes , and for consistency , it requires imaging of the entire cluster field .",
    "the fs91 definition of richness as equivalent to @xmath15 provides an alternative method for ordering groups by richness , provided again that a considerable and consistent fraction of the cluster is measured .",
    "the coma cluster is the nearest of the very rich abell clusters ( abell 1656 , richness class 2 , @xmath16 km / s ) . in this paper , we describe new luminosity and color data for the galaxies in the cluster core which allow us to define the edgr accurately : in section 2 , we summarize the observations and the derivation of the edgr . in section 3 , we discuss some implications of our data , particularly an interpretation of edgr - richness correlation in the context of cluster merger and observed substructure .",
    "our new ccd photometry is described fully in secker ( 1995=s95 ) and secker & harris ( 1996=sh96 ) . in brief , the kpno 4 m was used in april 1991 to mosaic - image the central region of the coma cluster in two colors ( @xmath17 ) , with the prime - focus camera and the te 2k ccd detector .",
    "the total area covered was @xmath18 arcmin@xmath1 , which included a field centered on each of ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 , and one extending nearly 23 arcmin south of ngc 4874 . a control field located about 2.1 degrees east of ngc 4874",
    "was also imaged , for statistical correction of the background population .",
    "total exposure times were 2700 seconds for both @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with the seeing between 1.1 and 1.3 arcsec . since our targets were e and de galaxies ( characteristically old stellar populations ) , we detected objects on the @xmath19-band images , which had a slightly deeper limiting magnitude for these moderately red objects .",
    "total magnitudes for all detected objects on the frames were determined by a curve - of - growth algorithm ( i.e. , apertures of radius @xmath21 ; see s95 ) and were tested for systematic correctness by extensive monte carlo simulations of the images .",
    "analysis also showed that detections of faint galaxies are @xmath22 percent complete to @xmath23 mag : brighter that this limit , ( minor ) completeness corrections are made to the measured luminosity function of the detected objects ; anything fainter than this limit was discarded so as to keep only the highest - confidence data . as well , we are complete in @xmath24 to this same level . typical uncertainties near our completeness limits are @xmath25 mag in @xmath19 and @xmath26 mag in @xmath24 .",
    "concerning our detection completeness of dwarf galaxies , we will comment on the two cases involving spatially - extended giant galaxies , near which our detection of dwarf galaxies is generally quite a bit more incomplete . in the end , we conclude that this spatial incompleteness does not not strongly affect our computed edgr .",
    "( i ) _ very near to brightest giants : _ while a bias against detecting close companion galaxies in a cluster environment such as coma certainly exists in wide - field data such as this , we note that the majority of the dwarf galaxy population is not gravitationally bound to any of the giant galaxies ( binggeli 1993 ; ferguson 1992 ; vader & chaboyer 1992 ) .",
    "thus , we do not expect this bias to affect our computed edgr since the affected area is quite small in total .",
    "( ii ) _ within an arcmin of the supergiant galaxies ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 : _ as detected by sh96 and by bernstein et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the radial number density profiles for de galaxies increases towards ngc 4874 .",
    "however , thompson & gregory ( 1993=tg93 ) determined that for their sample of bright de galaxies , this radial profile could be scaled downwards ( in central surface density ) , to match that of the early - type giant galaxies ; this is a direct indication that the edgr is constant with position in the cluster ( provided that the limiting magnitude to which the de galaxies are counted is not too faint ; see sh96 ) .",
    "this result of tg93 is analogous to the result of fs91 for the virgo cluster , that the edgr is independent of clustercentric radius .",
    "thus , the true edgr for the two excluded regions around the supergiant galaxies is consistent with our computed value for the cluster core , within fluctuations due to small number statistics arising from the small area concerned .",
    "( note that these two incomplete regions comprise a mere @xmath27 percent of the total area studied ) .",
    "the process of eliminating contaminating objects ( foreground stars and noncluster galaxies ) was done in two parts .",
    "non - stellar objects were reasonably well resolved in a parameter space of @xmath28 ( an image moment which sensitively measures central concentration ; see s95 , sh96 ) versus total magnitude @xmath19 .",
    "the sequence of starlike objects in this plane ( @xmath29 pixels ) brighter than @xmath30 mag is easily distinguished , and these bright starlike objects were discarded .",
    "( this is only a minor correction , since the overwhelming majority of detected objects in the coma field are nonstellar , faint galaxies . )",
    "next , the @xmath19 , @xmath24 color - magnitude diagram of all the remaining objects was used to remove the non - cluster galaxies from the sample . in this diagram ( figure [ fig1 ] ) , it is clear that the coma galaxies populate a narrowly defined sequence , confined ( conservatively ) to the range @xmath31 mag .",
    "we discarded any objects outside of this color range , leaving a total of 2526 candidate galaxies ( @xmath32 mag ) in the cluster core , compared to 694 objects on the control field . with a total area 2.57 times less than the cluster field area ,",
    "the control - field number density is @xmath33 objects arcmin@xmath34 .",
    "a comparison of our background number density with other similar studies is worthwhile .",
    "prior to color discrimination , but within the same magnitude range , our sample of control - field objects numbered 1146 , or a number density of 4.23 objects arcmin@xmath34 . by comparison , bernstein et al .",
    "( 1995 ) derive an @xmath19-band control - field number density given by 5.46 objects arcmin@xmath34 , over the same magnitude range .",
    "( this number corresponds to an average over five randomly located control fields , and not related to the position of the coma cluster . ) in his analysis of field galaxies , koo ( 1986 ) derived a mean galaxy number density of 3.69 arcmin@xmath34 to a magnitude cutoff of @xmath35 mag in the @xmath36 filter ( their red band pass ) in a field located near to ( but outside of ) the coma cluster . thus prior to imposing the color constraints ,",
    "our computed background number density is comparable to other derived values .",
    "this comparison clearly illustrates the benefits to deriving colors for all detected objects : the level of contamination by background objects is greatly reduced , without affecting the population of true cluster galaxies .",
    "the expected luminosity range for all types of dwarf galaxies is fainter than @xmath37 mag , and as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] , these objects are generously included in our survey .",
    "we do not attempt to divide these dwarf galaxies into their morphological subgroups ( nucleated and non - nucleated des , irregulars , etc . ) , simply because we have insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "however , the vast majority of our sample must be dwarf ellipticals uncontaminated by late - type systems : in their analysis of late - type dwarf ( dir ) galaxies in coma , tg93 find a significant decrease in the number density of dir galaxies in the coma cluster core , with typical values of 14  40 dir per square degree to @xmath38 . scaling these densities to our 0.194 square degree field",
    ", we therefore expect only 3  8 dirs to this limit , considerably less than the number of de galaxies ( cf .",
    "table [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "fainter than this , the luminosity function for dir galaxies is bounded ( binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 ) , unlike the still - rising luminosity function for de galaxies .",
    "brighter than @xmath37 , our sample includes all detected giant galaxies , excluding only the supergiants ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 . while the number of late - type _ giants _ in the cluster core is small , it is not negligible .",
    "thompson & gregory ( 1980 ) detect a total of 34 spiral galaxies in a 1.49 square degree region of the cluster core , such that in our sample we would expect 2  7 spirals .",
    "however , since we can not individually separate and discard the late - type dwarf galaxies , we do not discard the few late - type giants either .",
    "thus we are assuming that the contaminating late - type galaxies compose similar fractions of the bright and faint galaxy populations . while this late - type dwarf - to - giant ratio is _ slightly less _ than the edgr for rich clusters ( fs91 ) , the effect of sample contamination by late - type galaxies on the computed edgr will be small when averaged in with the much larger sample of early - type galaxies .    in both previous analyses ,",
    "fs91 and tg93 used visual classification to separate galaxies into their morphological subgroups , with surface brightness as the primary discriminator between giants and dwarfs .",
    "tg93 , and more recently biviano et al . ( 1995 ) determined that the composite luminosity function ( lf ) for the coma cluster is well fit by a gaussian distribution for the bright cluster members and a schechter function for the dwarf galaxies .",
    "the sum of these two functions , with the appropriate normalization , has been found to provide a better representation of the total luminosity function than a single schechter function .",
    "conveniently , the resulting scaled functions provide the _ relative contribution to the lf by each of the dwarf and giant galaxy populations_. it is this technique which we adopt in principle to determine the edgr value for our sample of cluster galaxies .",
    "the net galaxy lf which we analyze here is plotted in figure [ fig2 ] , where the number of galaxies per 0.5-mag bin is represented by the solid circle and the associated error bars .",
    "both the raw galaxy lf and the background field lf were first corrected for small incompleteness effects using a completeness function derived from the overlapping regions of the three adjacent coma fields ( i.e. , the sample is essentially 100 percent complete to 18th mag , falling gradually to 80 percent complete at 22.5 mag ) .",
    "the error bars for the net lf plotted in figure [ fig2 ] represent the poisson errors from the two individual lfs added in quadrature .",
    "weighted least - squares fits of a gaussian plus a schechter function to the luminosity function of figure [ fig2 ] then allowed us to solve for the relative contribution from each of the giant and dwarf galaxy populations .",
    "this fit formally involves six parameters : the peak magnitude @xmath39 , dispersion @xmath40 and normalization @xmath41 of the gaussian function for the giants , and the characteristic magnitude @xmath42 , the faint - end slope @xmath43 and normalization @xmath44 of the schechter lf for the dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , two of these parameters ( @xmath45 ) can be reasonably constrained _ a priori_. a separate analysis of the faint - end slope of our lf yields @xmath46 ( sh96 , and consistent with tg93 and bernstein et al .",
    "1995 ) , and we limit the gaussian dispersion to lie within the realistic range @xmath47 mag ( see tg93 and biviano et al .",
    "the numerical results corresponding to nine separate cases are summarized in table [ tbl-1 ] ; on the basis of the reduced @xmath48 values , any of these can be accepted on statistical grounds .",
    "the model fits corresponding to extreme values for @xmath40 and @xmath43 will define upper and lower limits to the edgr , while the adopted edgr represents the average of these extreme values .",
    "for all models considered here , the maximum edgr is for the smallest @xmath40 combined with a steep faint - end slope ( i.e. , fit 1a ) , while the minimum edgr is for the largest @xmath40 combined with a shallow faint - end slope ( i.e. , fit 5b ) .    as mentioned above",
    ", the calculation of the edgr involves numerically integrating the schechter function to an arbitrary limiting magnitude . to remain consistent with the limiting magnitudes used by fs91 ,",
    "it is necessary to convert our apparent @xmath19 total magnitudes to their absolute total magnitudes @xmath49 .",
    "to do so , we adopt the same parameters used by tg93 : a difference in distance moduli ( coma  virgo ) of 3.68 mag and @xmath20-band @xmath50-corrections of 0.12 mag for coma and 0.02 mag for virgo .",
    "to this we add the virgo distance modulus of 31.7 used by fs91 .",
    "finally , we adopt a mean de color of @xmath51 mag for @xmath52 ( s95 ; sh96 ) .",
    "this leads to a conversion factor , from our @xmath19 mag to a @xmath49 mag on the fs91 scale , of @xmath53 .",
    "then the four limiting magnitudes which we adopt are @xmath54 , 19.6 , 20.6 and 21.6 mag , corresponding to their @xmath7 , 14.5 , 13.5 and 12.5 mag limits .",
    "we integrate the gaussian function over the interval @xmath55 mag , and obtain values for the number of giants of n(e+s0 ) = 30.51 , 28.46 , 31.95 , 33.96 , 36.72 , 39.11 , 41.42 , 40.44 and 42.20 for model fits 1 , 1a , 1b , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 5a and 5b respectively . in table",
    "[ tbl-2 ] we provide the corresponding number of dwarfs n(de+de , n+ds0 ) and the coma edgr values , obtained by numerically integrating the schechter function over the appropriate magnitude ranges , using the parameter values relevant to the five different fits . in figure [ fig2 ] , we illustrate one of the model fits ( i.e. , fit 3 , with @xmath56 mag and @xmath57 ) to the composite luminosity function .",
    "the dotted lines designate the individual contributions from the dwarfs and giants , while the solid line is the direct sum of the two .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we have discussed the uncertainties inherent in our method and assumptions . here",
    "we briefly review these : ( a ) the dispersion of the gaussian distribution is varied through the range @xmath47 mag , consistent with observations ; ( b ) the faint - end slope of the schechter function is varied through the range @xmath46 , consistent with this and other analyses ; ( c ) poisson variations in the lf of faint background objects are accounted for ; ( d ) possible overestimates of the edgr which could result from the inclusion of late - type dir galaxies in the sample are counterbalanced by a similar fraction of late - type giants also present in the sample ( both late - type dwarfs and giants are present only at a very low level ) ; and ( e ) the completeness function is involved in the correction of both the program field and the control field lf , though at such a low level that plausible variations in it would have only a small effect . of these factors , ( a ) and ( b ) dominate the uncertainty estimates on our estimate of the coma edgr .    of immediate interest",
    "is whether our computed edgr for the coma cluster exceeds that measured for virgo , and thus if the edgr - richness correlation continues to this still - richer environment . in the top panel of figure [ fig3 ]",
    ", we compare our derived edgr values for the coma cluster ( i.e. , solid circles , from table [ tbl-2 ] ) with those computed for virgo ( i.e. , open circles ; fs91 ) .",
    "these two sets of values are entirely consistent at all four limiting @xmath19 magnitudes .",
    "this reflects the fact that the faint - end slopes of the galaxy lf are similar in both clusters .",
    "note that to a limit of @xmath58 mag , tg93 measured an edgr of 1.52 , slightly lower than ( but formally consistent with ) our value .",
    "while the primary difference between our values results from the the modeling of the log - normal distribution ( tg93 fix @xmath59 mag ) , it must also be due to the inclusion of lower - surface - brightness de galaxies in our deeper ccd sample ( s95 ; sh96 ) .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ]",
    ", we plot the edgr ( calculated to a limit of @xmath60 mag ) for five galaxy groups taken from fs91 . to place coma on this figure at the correct richness , we adopt n(e+s0 ) = 291 ( tg93 ) as a measure of the total number of giants in the entire coma cluster .",
    "adopting this value places coma as easily the richest galaxy cluster in this sample , in agreement with the abell richness class rankings .",
    "then , we use a coma edgr equal to 9.41@xmath612.14 ( table [ tbl-2 ] ) to scale the number of measured dwarf galaxies for the cluster core to the coma cluster as a whole . in this manner",
    ", we can put our derived edgr for the coma cluster on the richness scale used by fs91 and vader and sandage ( 1991 ) ( i.e. @xmath62 ) .    in this figure",
    ", the solid line has unit slope , representing a constant edgr with increasing cluster richness : the fornax , virgo and coma clusters clearly lie well above this line , while the leo , dorado , and ngc 1400 groups fall below .",
    "then from figure [ fig3 ] and table 2 , _ the edgr value for the coma cluster is consistent with that found for the virgo cluster , within our calculated uncertainties _ , and it is clearly lower than would have been expected if the edgr was to keep increasing monotonically with cluster richness .",
    "rich galaxy clusters exhibit considerable variation within individual richness classes , including properties such as : ( i ) the velocity dispersion of the member galaxies ; ( ii ) the bautz - morgan class , which measures the magnitude difference between the first- and second- ranked cluster galaxies ; ( iii ) the presence or absence of a central cd galaxy , ( iv ) x - ray emission ; ( v ) evidence for significant substructure .",
    "substructuring in particular must clearly be an important factor in determining the early - type dwarf - to - giant ratio .",
    "for example , if two or more richness - class 1 galaxy clusters merge to form a richer cluster , then to first order the total number of dwarf and giant galaxies will be conserved , and the edgr for the new ( richer ) cluster will mimic those for the original subclusters , rather than being larger as suggested by the basic correlation shown in figure 3 . thus the simple edgr - richness correlation must really represent an edgr - richness - subcluster correlation ( if not other parameters too ) .",
    "we are not suggesting that substructure replaces the dependence on richness : there remains an edgr - richness correlation for _ original _ groups and clusters .",
    "however , substructure can explain why the edgr for _ merger - product _ clusters can mimic the edgr of the less - rich subgroups , instead of being as rich as predicted by the edgr - richness correlation .    for the case of coma and virgo ,",
    "our results are consistent with a scenario in which , identifiable subgroups in these clusters are richer than the sparse clusters in the fs91 sample of poor groups , and are consistent with the coma cluster being the result of a significant number of merger events ( e.g. , fitchett & webster 1987 ; escalera , slezak & mazure 1992 ; davis & mushotzky 1993 ; mohr , fabricant & geller 1993 ; white , briel & henry 1993 ; west , jones & forman 1995 ; colless & dunn 1996 ) .",
    "we postulate that to find an edgr value which is clearly larger than the coma and virgo values , it will be necessary to survey a cluster environment which is rich _ by birth _ , rather than by subsequent growth . to turn this statement around",
    ", we suggest that a clear signature of the very richest , densest galaxy environments ( and by extension , the most massive cluster potential wells in the early universe ) should be the presence of a significantly higher edgr than coma or virgo .",
    "thus , for the edgr - richness correlation to be relevant to the formation and evolution of de galaxies and the galaxy cluster itself , we must disentangle the effects of richness and substructure .",
    "finally , sh96 discusses two additional factors affecting the edgr for rich galaxy clusters : ( i ) variation of the edgr with clustercentric radius , due to the destruction of faint des in the dense core , and ( ii ) a predicted increase in the edgr with cluster x - ray luminosity , resulting from a confinement pressure exerted by dense intracluster gas on proto - de galaxies ; i.e. , more of the young dwarf elliptical galaxies in gas - poor clusters should have expelled their metal - rich gas and subsequently faded ( cf . ,",
    "babul & rees 1992 ) .",
    "further surveys of other , more distant rich galaxy clusters to trace out these effects would be of great interest .    this research was supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada , through a grant to w.e.h . , and by the ontario ministry of colleges and universities , through an ontario graduate scholarship to j.s .",
    "we would like to thank an anonymous referee for helpful comments , and to acknowledge the assistance of stephen holland with the observations .",
