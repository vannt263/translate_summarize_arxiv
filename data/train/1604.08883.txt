    "particulate flows are of importance in many industrial and environmental applications , and subsequently are subject of research nowadays . though an apparently simple problem , the settling at low reynolds number of mono - disperse macroscopic solid particles in a newtonian fluid is not completely understood . due to the long range nature of hydrodynamics interactions ,",
    "the velocity disturbance caused by the motion of a particle decays as slowly as @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 the distance from the particle center ) . in the case of the simultaneous settling of several particles ,",
    "the resulting many - body interactions lead to complex trajectories .    indeed , in absence of inertia and in an unconfined newtonian fluid , one isolated particle settles at the stokes velocity @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the particles density , the fluid density , the fluid viscosity , the acceleration due to gravity and the radius of the particles .",
    "for a suspension of spheres of volume fraction @xmath8 , randomly and independently dispersed in a newtonian fluid , batchelor@xcite calculated a correction to the first order in @xmath8 , with average settling velocity @xmath9 . however , for confined suspensions of volume fraction larger than a few percents , there is no theoretical model available , and @xmath10 is often described using the empirical correlation@xcite @xmath11 , where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 $ ] , depending of the reynolds number ) is the hindrance function that exists due to the presence of a bottom boundary , and also to the hydrodynamic interactions among particles . due to these hydrodynamic interactions ,",
    "the settling velocity is constant only in average , and it fluctuates both spatially and temporally .",
    "the standard deviation of the measured particle velocities @xmath14 increases with the particle volume fraction up to @xmath15 before decreasing due to steric effects.@xcite for @xmath16 most of the experimental studies@xcite reported @xmath17 .",
    "these velocity fluctuations are attributed to the permanent evolution of the suspension microstructure : the local volume fraction of the suspension is higher in some regions , and , in those , particles settle faster than the average settling velocity , which in turn , due to the hydrodynamic interactions , modifies the microstructure of the suspension . assuming a uniform random spatial distribution of the particles , numerical and theoretical studies@xcite predicted an unrestricted increase of the standard deviation of the velocity fluctuations @xmath14 with the vessel size , while koch and shaqfeh@xcite found a single particle spatial distribution that prevents the divergence of @xmath14 .",
    "however , velocity fluctuations measured experimentally did not diverge with the size of the vessel .",
    "although , at early times , large - scale fluctuations of size comparable to that of the vessel width were observed , piv measurements spanning that dimension of the vessel showed that these fluctuations are transient . in the steady - state regime , which is achieved 500 stokes times @xmath18 after the beginning of the sedimentation@xcite , the spatial scale of the fluctuation is @xmath19 . in the same way , the spatial particle occupancy distribution was found to follow a poisson law @xcite at early times , but deviates from a poisson distribution in the steady - state regime.@xcite for confined suspensions , the size of the vessel has an influence @xmath14 for vessel widths@xcite @xmath20 with @xmath21 and for vessel thicknesses@xcite @xmath22 , @xmath14 scales as @xmath23 , according to a numerical study.@xcite finally , for suspensions confined in capillary tubes , a recent study@xcite reported an average settling velocity larger than @xmath24 .    in this paper , we investigate how the spatial distribution of the particles affects the velocity fluctuations . instead of analyzing particle occupancy in a fixed size window , @xcite we studied the way individual particles assemble in groups ( or `` clusters '' ) , which may contribute to an increase of the local density , which in turn should impact velocity fluctuations .",
    "the assembly of particles in clusters was characterized by studying the cluster population distribution , i.e. the probability density function of observing a cluster of @xmath25 particles , and of its statistical moments ( average , variance ) , as a function of the volume fraction @xmath8 and of the ratio @xmath26 between the cell thickness @xmath27 and the radius of the particles @xmath7 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the experimental setup , methodology and data processing are described in section [ sec : expsetup ] .",
    "results are presented in section [ sec : results ] , first describing the statistical properties of the cluster population [ sec : cluster ] , then analyzing how these properties influence the velocity fluctuations [ sec : velfluc ] .",
    "conclusions are discussed in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the hele - shaw cell ( fig . [ exp_setup].a ) , set vertically , consisted of two @xmath28 cm - thick parallel glass plates of @xmath29 , separated by two mylar spacers of @xmath30 , located along the two vertical sides of the cell .",
    "mylar thicknesses @xmath31 have been used to provide separation between plates @xmath26 = 5 , 9 , 12.5 and 15 .",
    "two perforated parallelepiped plexiglass pieces , with one and two milled holes respectively , were glued to the bottom and top sides of the cell .",
    "the bottom hole was connected to the injection syringe , while the top holes were connected to the purge reservoir for drainage . to avoid the presence of microscopic air bubbles after the cell filling ,",
    "all cells were saturated with @xmath32 prior to suspension injection . finally , to circumvent boycott effects,@xcite great attention has been paid to the verticality of the cell , which was controlled with an uncertainty of @xmath33 .",
    "suspensions of volume fraction @xmath34 $ ] were prepared by adding spherical polystyrene particles , of density @xmath35 and average radius @xmath36 , to distilled water , of density @xmath37 at @xmath38 .",
    "a small amount of sds surfactant has been added to the mixture to reduce surface tension in the solid - liquid interface .",
    "characterizations of the diameter and sphericity of the particles were performed using a morphology g3 equipment ( from malvern instrument ) , and are displayed on fig .",
    "[ exp_setup].b and c. as one can see , the standard deviation is approximately @xmath39 for an average diameter @xmath40 , and less than @xmath41 of the particles have a circularity ( ratio of the two axes of the ellipse which best fits the perimeter of the particles ) bellow @xmath42 .",
    "suspensions were stirred and then transferred to the injection syringe that was held always vertical to minimize deposition of particles .",
    "then , the suspension was injected into the cell .",
    "finally , once the suspension saturated the cell , valves were closed and the suspension settles freely .",
    "this procedure took approximatively 5@xmath43 which corresponds to 10 stokes time @xmath44 , largely bellow the duration of the transient regime ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the motion of the particles was captured using a 8-bit ccd camera , located @xmath46 cm from the cell , with its optical axis perpendicular to the cell plates .",
    "the imaging window , situated in the middle of the hele - shaw cell , was 2.7 @xmath47 width by 3.6 @xmath47 high .",
    "the depth - of - field allowed one to visualize particles all across the cell thickness ( _ e.g. _ fig.[exp_setup2].a ) .",
    "the positions of the particle centers were detected using a hough transformation with an uncertainty of less than one pixel ( or 1/8 particle diameters ) . however , if two particles are separated by a distance shorter than @xmath48 , the hough transform technique used is not capable of detecting both of them .",
    "stacks of 300 images , captured with a time interval @xmath49 between images , were used to obtain particles trajectories , with a minimal total square displacement rule , and their velocities , using a second order scheme . for each experiment ,",
    "five stacks were recorded with a time interval @xmath50 between them , to improve statistics . finally , to avoid any transient effects , the first stack is acquired @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) after the beginning of the sedimentation .",
    "the number of the detected particles @xmath53 in the imaging window was approximately constant in time . within a stack , the standard deviation of @xmath53 divided by its average was @xmath54 , while @xmath55 when considering the five acquired stacks .",
    "these fluctuations of the number of particles might be considered negligible , and subsequently , the particle volume fraction @xmath8 was approximately constant during the sedimentation . despite the steadiness of the average volume fraction @xmath8 at the scale of the imaging window in time , fig.[exp_setup2].a evidences that , as already reported,@xcite the spatial distribution of the particles might not be homogeneous .",
    "as a first step to characterize this distribution , the pair correlation function @xmath56 was computed for the particle positions as detected by the camera .",
    "this function represents the probability of finding the center of a particle at a dimensionless distance @xmath57 away from a given reference particle .",
    "figure  [ exp_setup2].b displays in continuous lines the experimental @xmath56 for different @xmath8 and @xmath26 combinations . for the same @xmath26 and @xmath8 combinations , in dashed lines",
    "it is shown the @xmath56 calculated numerically for a random configuration of particles , situated independently , and following a uniform spatial distribution ( except for the hard sphere excluded volume ) . in all cases , the @xmath56 for a uniform distribution shows no evident structure .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath56 for the experiments presents a well defined peak near @xmath58 , and some second order structure , independently of @xmath8 .",
    "this reveals an existing microstructure in the settling suspension .",
    "the non - null value of @xmath56 for @xmath59 , which might suggest the overlapping of particles , is in fact due to the projection of the actual 3d particle configuration in the @xmath60 plane , as detected by the camera .",
    "the peak near @xmath61 implies that a significant fraction of the particles settle side by side : during the sedimentation , particles were not isolated but assemble into clusters , with their centers likely to be @xmath62 away from each other . within these clusters , the fluid should have roughly the same velocity as the particles .",
    "the presence of a peak at @xmath61 has already been reported , using mri techniques , for a macroscopic suspension settling in a large cell.@xcite .",
    "besides , clusters are also clearly visible on fig.4 of the study of bergougnoux and guazzelli,@xcite which shows the location of particle centers during the sedimentation of a suspension of glass spheres with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "clusters were detected  neighbour by neighbour \" , _",
    "i.e. _ , all the particles with centers closer than @xmath65 from a reference particle were searched recursively .",
    "once all the particles in a given cluster were identified , it was verified that no one was counted more than once .",
    "this procedure allowed one to sort all the particles in sets of clusters of @xmath25 particles . for completeness",
    ", isolated particles were considered as a cluster with @xmath25=1 . in the following ,",
    "we analyse the population distribution @xmath66 of the clusters as function of @xmath8 and of @xmath26 .",
    "it should be noted that the clusters were identified on the acquired images , in which the real 3d particle spatial configuration was projected in the @xmath67 plane by the camera .",
    "this causes the measured distances between particles to be smaller than the real ones .",
    "the projection error in such a measurement increases as @xmath26 increases ( would be non - existent for @xmath26 = 2 because all particles would lay in the @xmath67 plane with perfect match between real and projected configurations ) .",
    "this projection error may lead to an overestimation of the number @xmath25 of the particles in a cluster . while this error can not be calculated directly , because it depends in the actual 3d spatial configuration of the particles , which is unknown , an upper bound for it was estimated as 0.15 ( 15% relative error ) for @xmath68 ( the largest @xmath26 ratio in the experiments ) .",
    "the error decreases with decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "details of this estimation are provided in section [ sec : appendix ] .    for a given combination of @xmath8 and @xmath26 ,",
    "the number of clusters made of @xmath25 particles decreases with @xmath25 .",
    "this behavior is illustrated on fig.[clus].a , which displays , for @xmath69 and @xmath26 = 15 , the number of clusters @xmath70 of @xmath25 particles as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "once normalized , this distribution corresponds to the probability density function @xmath66 of cluster population .",
    "@xmath66 is displayed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ clus].a as a function of @xmath25 in a semilog scale .",
    "as one can see , @xmath66 is rather well fitted with an exponential law ( solid line ) @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the average of @xmath73 .",
    "one should note that if the probability that a particle belongs to a given cluster is independent of the population of the latter , this would lead @xmath66 to follow a poisson law .",
    "the dashed line on the inset of fig.[clus].a , which represents this law , shows that this hypothesis is not verified in our experiments .",
    "this is confirmed by the evolution of the standard deviation @xmath74 as a function of @xmath72 , displayed on fig.[clus].b for @xmath75 and @xmath76 and for @xmath77 . the data collapse onto a single curve , and for large enough @xmath72 ( @xmath78 ) @xmath79 , in agreement with @xmath66 following an exponential law .",
    "however , for @xmath80 ( roughly isolated particles ) , we observe a small departure from this linear relation .",
    "the velocity fluctuations were characterized by the standard deviation of the particle velocities normalized by their average .",
    "these magnitudes were calculated over all the particles in the last 299 images of each stack .",
    "the velocity fluctuations obtained in this way for the five different stacks captured in each experiment were in agreement within a @xmath81 variation and , in the following , @xmath82 corresponds to an average over the five stacks .",
    "the relatively small variation of @xmath82 over the different stacks confirms that , in the steady - state regime,@xcite the velocity fluctuations have no significant evolution during the sedimentation .",
    "figure  [ deltav].a displays @xmath82 in logarithmic scale , as a function of @xmath8 for the four values of @xmath26 studied . for all @xmath26 , @xmath83 , in agreement with previous studies@xcite and a theoretical prediction that accounts for the presence of confining walls.@xcite indeed , for @xmath84 the volume fraction was large enough , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath76 respectively ) so that particles interact with each other more than with the walls .",
    "it has to be noted that this trend exists even for @xmath89 while @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , best fits of the evolution of @xmath82 with @xmath91 leads to @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath76 respectively , in agreement with @xmath95 reported in a numerical study.@xcite     as a function of @xmath8 ( a ) , and as a function of the standard deviation of @xmath96 ( b ) .",
    "@xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 correspond respectively to best fits over @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 with the expression @xmath108 .",
    "these fits yield @xmath109 and @xmath93 .",
    "the solid line in ( b ) is @xmath110.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as a function of @xmath8 ( a ) , and as a function of the standard deviation of @xmath96 ( b ) .",
    "@xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 correspond respectively to best fits over @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 with the expression @xmath108 .",
    "these fits yield @xmath109 and @xmath93 .",
    "the solid line in ( b ) is @xmath110.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to study the connection between velocity fluctuations and the cluster population distribution , we followed caflish,@xcite hinch,@xcite and rouyer _",
    "et al._@xcite who related the velocity fluctuations to the statistical fluctuations of the spatial distribution of the particles by considering a `` blob '' , _",
    "i.e. _ a given region of space with an excess of particles .",
    "balancing the apparent weight of the blob with its stokes drag , they calculated its excess of velocity .",
    "using the same approach , we consider here a cluster of @xmath25 particles .",
    "the apparent weight of the cluster is : @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the densities of the particles and the fluid respectively , while @xmath114 is the volume of a particle . assuming spherical clusters of radius @xmath115 , the stokes drag may be written as : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the velocity of the cluster , @xmath5 the fluid viscosity and @xmath118 is the hindering function@xcite that takes into account the backflow due to the confinement .",
    "then , balancing the drag with the apparent weight yields @xmath119 .",
    "finally , writing @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the effective volume fraction of the cluster , one obtains : @xmath122 and subsequently , since @xmath123 , the standard deviation of the cluster velocities reads : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the standard deviation of @xmath96 .",
    "figure  [ deltav].b displays the standard deviation of the vertical velocities @xmath126 normalized with the average settling velocity @xmath10 as a function of @xmath125 .",
    "the data collapse fairly well onto a single master curve with a linear trend , for all @xmath8 and @xmath26 . the continuous line on fig .",
    "[ deltav].b has a slope of 0.86 which would correspond to spherical clusters of a random close packing of spheres ( @xmath127 for @xmath128 ) .",
    "as one can see , experimental data are slightly above the prediction for spherical clusters .    the fact that velocity fluctuations can be strongly related to inhomogeneities in the particle spatial distribution",
    "has been shown theoretically @xcite , and some authors @xcite characterized this inhomogeneity in a fixed inspection window .",
    "this result extends the validity of previous findings@xcite by determining the relation between velocity fluctuations and the population of particle clusters , rather than particle distribution in a fixed inspection window .",
    "the spatial distribution of particles in a settling suspension has been studied .",
    "the pair correlation function of the particle positions have revealed a peak for a distance of 2.2 particle radius between particle centers , which suggested a cutoff length for defining clusters of settling particles .",
    "the distribution of the number of particles in the clusters have been found to follow an exponential law .",
    "the average and the standard deviation of this distribution increase with the particle volume fraction @xmath8 , while the ratio @xmath26 appears to have only weak influence in the range studied .",
    "the measured velocity fluctuations were rather well predicted assuming that particles assemble in spherical clusters .",
    "the discrepancy between the experimental result and the predicted value of 0.86 ( figure  [ deltav].b ) could be related to the fact that the particle diameter distribution ( fig . [",
    "exp_setup].b ) presented a small degree of polidispersity , which might increase the value of @xmath121 compared with monodisperse spheres .",
    "however , results by other authors @xcite indicate that for such a narrow distribution , this increase is likely to be negligible .",
    "another possible explanation is that clusters are not perfectly spherical but more prolate spheroids : a prolate spheroid with its longest axis aligned with the gravity direction would settle faster than one with its longest axis perpendicular to the gravity direction .",
    "the resulting fluctuations in the settling velocity , if both axis alignments coexist , would then be larger than for spherical only clusters . to be conclusive on this aspect of the velocity fluctuations ,",
    "one should calculate the probability density function of the clusters aspect ratio and of their orientation with respect to gravity , which would require a large amount of detected clusters to achieve a good statistical sampling .",
    "while such a description is beyond the scope of the present study , it constitutes an interesting motivation for future work .",
    "the authors would like to thank n. torres cabrera for contributing to the development of the tracking code and for preliminary experiments , and l. oger , d. salin , f. rouyer and g. drazer for fruitful discussions .",
    "this research has been supported by pip 0246 conicet , anpcyt pict-2013 - 2584 , and the lia - fmf in physics and mechanics of fluids .",
    "the measurement error due to projection could not be directly calculated , because it depends in the actual 3d spatial configuration of the particles , which is unknown . if particles are closer to each other than in the case of a uniform random distribution , forming clusters , as suggested by the peak in the experimental @xmath56 , and as it is the thesis of the present work , the error calculated for such a distribution may provide an upper bound for the error in the experimental configurations .",
    "as stated in the manuscript , two particles participate in a cluster if they are less than @xmath129 away from each other .",
    "the projection error can be then quantified by comparing the probability for two particles being less than @xmath129 away from each other in the 2d projection , with the same probability in the actual 3d particle spatial configuration .",
    "as the first probability exceeds the second one , the error increases .    from the @xmath56 curves shown in figure  [ exp_setup2].b ,",
    "it can be noted that , in the 2d projection , if two particles are separated by a distance shorter than @xmath48 , the hough transform technique used is not capable of detecting both of them .",
    "taking this into account , the first probability reads :          where @xmath132 is the @xmath133 calculated from the 2d projection of the particle positions as viewed by the camera , and @xmath134 is the @xmath133 of the actual particle distances in 3d spatial configuration .    the relative error can be written as : @xmath135 . for @xmath136 and @xmath68 ( the largest @xmath26 ratio in the experiments ) ,",
    "this estimation yields @xmath137 or a 15% relative error .",
    "the error @xmath138 decreases as @xmath26 decreases .",
