    "parametric resonances can also occur in bose - einstein condensates made of ultracold atomic gases . from the theoretical side , they have already been investigated in 3d @xcite and 2d @xcite harmonically trapped condensates , for condensates in oscillating double - well potentials @xcite and in deep optical lattices @xcite .",
    "these investigations are based on suitable effective hamiltonians in which the interaction between the atoms enters through a mean - field term proportional to the condensate density .",
    "most of them make use of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , which has the form of a non - linear schrdinger equation and gives a very accurate description of dilute condensates @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have recently shown that parametric resonances can be the origin of the large and broad response observed by esslinger and co - workers @xcite in the superfluid phase of a condensate in an optical lattice .",
    "our claim was based on the results of numerical simulations , namely the integration of the time - dependent gp equation . in the present work",
    "we perform a more systematic analysis , by investigating the behavior of bogoliubov quasiparticles subject to a periodic modulation of the lattice .",
    "the purpose is to gain a deeper insight into the process of parametric resonances , in particular into the conditions for the occurrence of the instability , the growth rates associated with the parametric amplification of an excitation and the role of the initial fluctuations ( seed excitations ) which trigger the onset of the amplification .",
    "the basic theory is presented in section [ section - bogo ] .",
    "we consider an infinite condensate at zero temperature , subject to a transverse harmonic potential and to a 1d optical lattice along the @xmath0-direction , with @xmath1 atoms per lattice site .",
    "the effect of the optical lattice can be expressed through the periodic potential @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the bragg wave vector , @xmath4 is the lattice spacing and @xmath5 is the lattice depth in units of the recoil energy @xmath6 . the transverse harmonic confinement , of frequency @xmath7 , is taken to be sufficiently strong to inhibit excitations involving the radial degrees of freedom on the energy scale we are concerned with .",

    "the latter obeys an effective 1d gp equation which includes the atom - atom interaction through a coupling constant @xmath11 .",
    "we first consider the case of a static optical lattice ( @xmath12 ) and we find the bogoliubov spectrum as a result of the linearization of the gp equation with regard to a small change , @xmath13 , of the condensate wave function",
    ". then we study the evolution of the system under a modulation of lattice depth in the form @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "a stability analysis is done in order to find the parametrically unstable modes and calculate their growth rate for given values of the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the average linear density .",
    "we use a bogoliubov quasiparticle projection method @xcite in order to provide a deeper insight into the mechanisms of instability .",
    "when @xmath16 is not too large , the main mechanism which drives a parametric resonance is a coupling between pairs of counter - propagating bogoliubov axial excitations of frequencies @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the wave vector and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are bloch band indexes .",
    "the multi - mode stability analysis then reduces to a two - mode approximation .",
    "the resonance condition becomes @xmath24 , which yields @xmath25 for axial phonons in the lowest bloch band .",
    "this approximation is discussed in section [ section-2mode ] , where we show that the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be combined in a single parameter @xmath26 , which contains all relevant information about the stability diagram and the growth rate .",

    "it describes the coupling between bogoliubov modes belonging to the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands and having opposite quasi - momenta .",
    "this coupling is mediated by the time - dependence of the lattice potential . in the tight binding regime ,",
    "i.e. when the lattice depth is large enough to split up the condensate in almost independent condensates at each lattice site , a semi - analytic result can be derived for the quantity @xmath28 describing the parametric resonance of modes of the lowest bogoliubov band . in this case , in fact , the quantity @xmath29 can be simply expressed through the @xmath5-dependence of the effective mass and the compressibility of the condensate .",
    "this regime is discussed in section [ section - tb ] .",
    "the numerical results of the stability analysis are shown in section [ section - results ] together with those of the two - mode and tight - binding approximations .",
    "the two - mode approximation turns out to be very accurate in the whole range of parameters here considered . at large @xmath15 the tight binding expressions work well .",
    "the approach to this regime is faster when the mean - field interaction is small ( i.e. , small values of @xmath17 ) .    in section [ section - gp ] the results obtained in the previous sections by linearizing the gp equation for an infinite condensate",

    "the timescale and the size of @xmath211 predicted in this work seem well compatible with feasible experiments .",
    "as we already noticed , at the mean - field level the parametric resonances occur only if the relevant bogoliubov modes are initially occupied . within the two - mode approximation , discussed in section [ section-2mode ]",

    "this quantity is exponentially amplified in time .",
    "different mechanisms can cause a non - vanishing @xmath154 .",
    "the condensate can be simply out of equilibrium at the beginning of the modulation due to non - adiabatic processes when it is loaded in the trap and in the optical lattices .",
    "this yields some excitations over the groundstate .",
    "a similar and controllable seed could be added to the condensate by exciting certain bogoliubov modes by means of an appropriate external perturbation ( e.g. , two - photon bragg scattering ) before starting the lattice modulation .",
    "both these types of seed can be described with the gp equation . on the contrary ,",
    "the gp equation does not account for thermal and quantum fluctuations , which have to be treated with different methods beyond mean - field .    in sections [ section - bogo ] and [ section-2mode ] we treated the collective excitations of the condensate by linearizing the gp equation .",
    "we have also used the bogoliubov quasiparticle amplitudes , solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bogo ] ) , as basis functions to represent the fluctuating component @xmath81 , the coefficients of the expansion ( [ atilde ] ) being c - numbers related to the population of the collective modes . this allowed us to interpret the dynamics in terms of coupling and growth of bogoliubov excitations .",
    "a natural generalization consists in replacing these c - numbers with the quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators , as in the standard bogoliubov theory @xcite .",
    "in such a way one can treat both thermal and quantum fluctuations , under the only assumption that the total number of particles @xmath1 is macroscopic and the fraction of noncondensed particles is much smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "a direct connection between this quantum treatment of the operator @xmath255 and our previous approach of section [ section-2mode ] can be found by using the wigner representation of the quantum fields @xcite . in this way",
    ", the dynamics is still governed by the classical equations of sections [ section - bogo ] and [ section-2mode ] , but the condensate depletion is now included _ via _ a stochastic distribution of the coefficients @xmath50 .",
    "exact results can be obtained by averaging over many different realizations of the condensate in the same equilibrium conditions .",

    "one can make use of ( [ eq : wigner0])-([eq : wigner ] ) to evaluate the mean effective seed defined in ( [ eq : eta ] ) , finding @xmath259 equation ( [ eq : etat ] ) provides a way to extract information about the initial seed from the measurement of the exponential growth of the incoherent fraction .",
    "for example , within the two mode approximation described in section [ section-2mode ] , one finds that the number of particles in the modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 at @xmath260 , averaged over many realizations , grows as @xmath261 with @xmath262 at different times during the parametric amplification and extract its value at @xmath237 from a fit , then eqs .",
    "( [ eq : etat ] ) and ( [ eq : deltan ] ) give direct information on the quantum or thermal nature of the seed , provided the bogoliubov spectrum of the condensate is known .",
    "the thermal regime is obtained when @xmath263 and corresponds to the `` classical '' limit where the occupation numbers of the relevant modes are large . in this regime , the parametric response of the system to the lattice modulation can provide a thermometry . let us suppose , in fact , that an experiment is set up to observe the exponential growth at @xmath25 , as in the simulation of fig .  [ gp1 ] , and that the dispersion law @xmath74 is also known ( either from calculations or by direct measurements of @xmath228 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : etat ] ) predicts @xmath264 for @xmath265 , so that the knowledge of the spectrum and the average seed vs. @xmath21 provides an estimate of the temperature @xmath111 .",
    "if the fit works well this means that the gas of excitations is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this is an important result in view of the fact that the temperature we are speaking about can be much smaller than the temperatures which can be measured with current techniques , based on the detection of the thermal cloud . in the absence of a visible thermal cloud ,",
    "parametric resonances appear to be an interesting method to make small thermal fluctuation detectable _ via _ a selective amplification .",
    "the other important limiting case is that encountered when @xmath266 . in this condition",
    "the initial population of the unstable modes is mainly due to quantum fluctuations and @xmath267 .",
    "the modulation of the lattice thus acts on the quantum vacuum , squeezing it and tranferring energy to the system .",
    "so , even at @xmath268 , one can parametrically excite the condensate by amplification of the vacuum fluctuations and this is a signature of its underlying quantum nature .",
    "this regime is analogous to the parametric down conversion , a well - known phenomenon in nonlinear quantum optics @xcite .",
    "a conceptually interesting point is that the amplification of quantum fluctuations acts as a source of entangled quasiparticles , analoguous to parametric sources of entangled photon pairs in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "a particularly appealing case is that of a modulation frequency @xmath84 such as to resonantly excite two counter - propagating quasiparticles in different bands , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in this case , the quasiparticle pair is represented by the entangled state @xmath269 a quite similar situation has been recently discussed for the generation of branch - entangled polariton pairs in microcavities through spontaneous interbranch parametric scattering @xcite .",
    "it is finally worth mentioning that the creation of quasiparticle pairs out of vacuum fluctuations can also be viewed as a manifestation of a dynamic casimir effect : the environment in which quasiparticles live is periodically modulated in time and this modulation transforms virtual quasiparticles into real quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "in this work we have explored the origin and the effects of parametric resonances in elongated bose - einstein condensates subject to a 1d optical lattice whose intensity is periodically modulated in time .",
    "we have used a suitable linearization of the time - dependent gp equation to calculate the stability diagram and the growth rate of unstable modes .",
    "we have shown that the main mechanism of instability is a coupling between pairs of counter - propagating bogoliubov excitations .",
    "this coupling is caused by the modulation of the background in which the excitations live .",
    "this picture emerges quite clearly when a two - mode approximation is considered . in this case",
    ", one can derive semi - analytic results for the coupling between bogoliubov modes in different bands and discuss the convergence to the tight binding regime .",
    "the results have been compared with those of time - dependent gp simulations , for both condensates which are infinite and trapped in the axial direction .",
