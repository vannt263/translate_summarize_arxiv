    "the study of elemental abundances in the stellar atmosphere is an important part of modern astronomy .",
    "carbon and oxygen are among the most important elements and the carbon - to - oxygen ratio is expected to be the essential parameter of the atmosphere of the star hosting planets , which controls the nature of the planets . in the early 2000 s , possible existence of carbon dominated planets with carbon dominated silicates was discussed @xcite .    in the early 2010 s ,",
    "some determinations of the carbon - to - oxygen ratios in solar - type stars found that @xmath425% of nearby stars have c / o @xmath1 0.8 and @xmath48% have c / o @xmath1 1.0 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the mineralogy of planets formed in the environmental gas with c / o @xmath0 will make carbon dominated rocky planets , rather than oxygen dominated planets .",
    "these large fractions of high c / o ratio stars were criticized by @xcite who pointed out some issues .",
    "first the frequency of high c / o is inconsistent with relatively small fraction of dwarf carbon stars ( @xmath5 ) in large samples of low - mass stars .",
    "second , these high c / o ratios are overestimated .",
    "the possible reasons for this overestimation are a high c / o ratio for the sun used for differential abundance analysis and the treatment of a ni blend that affects the o abundance .    a careful analysis of carbon and oxygen abundances of fg main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood was presented by @xcite by taking into account the non - lte effects in the model atmosphere and a critical analysis of the ni blend to the forbidden [ oi ] line at 6300 . among 66 nearby disk stars",
    "for which @xmath67774 oi triplet was analyzed with the non - lte analysis , no star with c / o@xmath0 was found .",
    "@xcite conclude that c / o does not exceed 0.8 , and this result seems to exclude formation of carbon dominated planets .    star formation history of m dwarfs is expected not to be so different from that of solar - type stars and they can also be used as probes of high c / o in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the spectra of m dwarfs include absorption bands of o - containing molecules such as tio , vo , and caoh , which are sensitive to the available o abundance , and hence c / o . in a two dimensional space span by tio and cah indices , @xcite and @xcite plot a sequence of m dwarfs from which a small number of stars deviate in the direction of higher c / o .",
    "@xcite estimates that high c / o@xmath7 stars constitute less than @xmath8 of m dwarfs with 99% confidence , while @xcite show that a high c / o ratio ( 0.9 ) is less than 1% .",
    "recently carbon and oxygen abundances of 46 m dwarfs have been obtained respectively from co and h@xmath2o molecular lines derived from @xmath3 band spectra obtained at the subaru telescope with a resolution of 20,000 @xcite . in this paper , we present the c / o ratios of these m dwarfs and examine the kinematics of the sample in terms of stellar population in  2 and compare the distribution of c / o of these m dwarfs with those of solar - type stars obtained by others using the kolmogorov - smirnov test in  3 .",
    "implications of the comparison results are discussed in  4 .",
    "while abundance indicators of carbon and oxygen lines in solar - type stars are sensitive to physical conditions of atmospheric models , there are numerous lines of stable co and h@xmath2o in the @xmath3 band as abundance indicators in m dwarfs , which are insensitive to detailed physical conditions of atmospheric models as shown graphically in figure 13 of @xcite .",
    "however , spectroscopic analysis of m dwarfs in the @xmath3 band has been deemed difficult due to the severe veiling of the spectra by h@xmath2o bands , which hides the true continuum necessary to measure equivalent widths .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have overcome this problem in the following manner .",
    "they first examine the nature of veil opacities and then modify the way to measure equivalent widths .",
    "the progress in molecular line database such as hitemp @xcite has reached the point that it allows the evaluation of the pseudo - continuum level of m dwarf spectra fairly accurately .",
    "they reformulate the spectroscopic analysis so as to refer to the pseudo - continuum defined by the molecular veil opacities , in stead of referring to the true continumm    first , the determination of carbon abundance from the ro - vibrational lines of the co(2 - 1 ) band is described .",
    "since the continuum of the observed m dwarf spectrum is depressed by numerous weak lines of h@xmath2o , what can be seen is only the pseudo - continuum . in the case of the model spectrum of the m dwarf , not only the true continuum , but also the pseudo - continuum can easily be evaluated owing to the recently available h@xmath2o line database .",
    "then the analysis of the m dwarf spectrum can be performed by referring to the pseudo - continuum levels both on the observed and theoretical spectra .",
    "therefore the abundant co lines are superb carbon abundance indicators , since most of the carbon atoms are in co molecules , which are stable at low temperatures .",
    "next , the determination of oxygen abundance from the ro - vibrational lines of h@xmath2o is described .",
    "the procedure is similar to the case of co lines .",
    "h@xmath2o lines in the m dwarf spectrum are heavily blended with each other and the true continuum level is hidden by the collective absorption of h@xmath2o lines themselves . however , it is possible to perform the analysis of h@xmath2o lines by referring to the pseudo - continuum consistently defined on the observed and theoretical spectra . in the atmosphere of cool m dwarfs , oxygen atoms",
    "are first used to form co molecules .",
    "then almost all the oxygen atoms left after the formation of co molecules are used to form stable h@xmath2o molecules , which are unaffected by the uncertainties due to the imperfection in photospheric models .",
    "thus abundant h@xmath2o lines are very good oxygen abundance indicators",
    ". it would be convenient if carbon and oxygen abundances for the sun could be derived from a @xmath3 band spectrum as for m dwarfs , but it is impossible , since co and h@xmath2o molecules dissociate in the atmosphere of the sun .",
    "the derived carbon and oxygen abundances which are compiled from @xcite for 46 m dwarfs are given in table 1 .",
    "one of the important characteristics of this data set is that none of the m dwarfs has a c / o ratio greater than 0.8 .",
    "the sample m dwarfs are nearby ( d@xmath9 20 pc ) , and expected to be mostly thin disk stars in terms of stellar population . to confirm this expectation explicitly ,",
    "we have analyzed their kinematics in the galaxy in terms of space velocities in the local standard of rest .",
    "the space velocities are calculated from proper motions , parallaxes , and radial velocities obtained from simbad using the transformation formula given by @xcite .",
    "these space velocities are given in table 1 and a toomre diagram is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the majority of the m dwarfs show thin disk kinematics except for a couple of stars showing marginally thick disk kinematics ( @xmath10 kms@xmath11 ) . there is no star showing halo kinematics .",
    "brief introduction to the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test is given below @xcite .",
    "the two - sample k - s test is applicable to a pair of unbinned distributions that are functions of a single independent variable . in our case ,",
    "the independent variable is the c / o ratio of a star .",
    "we would like to know whether two sets of data are drawn from the same parent distribution function , or from different distribution functions .",
    "the procedure in statistics is itemized in the following .",
    "\\(i ) we first set the null hypothesis that data set 1 and data set 2 are derived from the same parent distribution .",
    "\\(ii ) we calculate the cumulative probability distribution @xmath12 of data set 1 and the cumulative probability distribution @xmath13 of data set 2 .",
    "the cumulative distribution @xmath14 is obtained as follows . if there are @xmath15 data points located at @xmath16 , which are sorted into ascending order , @xmath17 is the function giving the fraction of data points to the left of @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath17 is constant between consecutive @xmath19 s and it jumps by the constant @xmath20 at each @xmath19 .",
    "\\(iii ) different estimates of cumulative distribution function are given by different data sets .",
    "however , all cumulative distribution functions agree at the smallest value of @xmath18 where they are zero , and at the largest value of @xmath18 where they are unity .",
    "the smallest and largest values of @xmath18 might be @xmath21 .",
    "therefore the distributions are distinguished by the behavior between the largest and smallest values .",
    "\\(iv ) we obtain the statistic , kolmogorov - smirnov @xmath22 : it is defined as the maximum value of the absolute difference between two cumulative distribution functions .",
    "thus for comparing two different cumulative distribution functions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the k - s statistic is    @xmath23    \\(v ) the k - s statistic is useful because we can calculate its distribution in the case of null hypothesis that data sets are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "therefore any nonzero value of @xmath22 is significant .",
    "the significance level of observed value @xmath22 ( as a disproof of the null hypothesis ) or the probability that @xmath22 greater than this observed value is obtained by chance , is given by the formula ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the number of data points in @xmath26 and @xmath27 is that in @xmath28 and the right hand side is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath29 .",
    "\\(vi ) for a significance level of 1% ( probability = 0.01 ) , if    @xmath30    we disprove the null hypothesis and conclude that the two cumulative distributions are derived from different parent distributions .",
    "\\(vii ) on the other hand , failing to disprove the null hypothesis , only shows that the data sets can be consistent with a single parent distribution function .",
    "we compare using the k - s test pairs of data sets of cumulative distributions of c / o ratios .",
    "the five data sets of c / o ratios we consider are the following .",
    "\\(a ) m dwarfs of this work ( 46 data points ) .",
    "carbon and oxygen abundances have been determined with respect to hydrogen abundance .",
    "these are not the result of a differential abundance analysis with respect to the sun .",
    "there is no assumption on the c / o ratio of the sun .",
    "\\(b ) @xcite ( 149 data points )",
    "the sample consists of nearby disk f , g , and k dwarfs and subgiants .",
    "the abundances of carbon are determined from ci 5052 and 5380 lines .",
    "non - lte effect is taken into account for these permitted lines .",
    "they examine three oxygen indicators , the [ oi ] 6300 ( forbidden line ) , oi 6158 and oi 7774 triplet for which non - lte effect is taken into account and decide to adopt the oxygen abundances determined from the oi 7774 triplet .",
    "their abundance analysis is differential with respect to the sun and they present [ c / fe ] and [ o / fe ] as their final product , from which [ c / o ] is calculated .",
    "they do not make any assumption on solar abundances of carbon and oxygen , so c / o ratios in absolute scale are not provided .",
    "\\(c ) @xcite ( 66 data points )    the sample consists of f and g stars in the galactic disk .",
    "carbon abundances are determined from ci 5052 and 5380 lines and oxygen abundances are determined from the oi 7774 triplet for which non - lte corrections are applied .",
    "they also analyze the [ oi ] 6300 ( forbidden line ) and find that the better result is obtained from the oi 7774 triplet .",
    "these are a product of differential abundance analysis and they use a solar c / o ratio of 0.58 @xcite to obtain c / o ratios in absolute scale .",
    "\\(d ) @xcite ( 331 data points )    the sample consists of f , g , and k stars from harps gto sample @xcite .",
    "carbon abundances are determined from ci 5052 and 5380 lines and oxygen abundances are determined from the [ oi ] 6300 forbidden line . the abundance analysis is differential with respect to the sun .",
    "they adopt a high solar c / o ratio of 0.66 @xcite to obtain c / o ratios in absolute scale .",
    "\\(e ) @xcite ( 446 data points )    the sample consists of f and g stars from the spocs catalog @xcite and the n2k sample @xcite .",
    "carbon abundances are determined from ci 6587 line and oxygen abundances are from [ oi ] 6300 line .",
    "they adopt a solar c / o ratio of 0.63 @xcite to obtain c / o ratios in absolute scale .",
    "since the c / o ratios of m dwarfs are given in absolute scale , the data set to be compared must also be given in absolute scale . since",
    "no solar abundance ratio is given in the work of @xcite , it is excluded in this comparison . in the following , the results of comparison between pairs are described .",
    "the cumulative distributions are given graphically in figure 2 , and the parameters of the k - s test and corresponding panels in figure 2 are summarized in table 2 .      the k - s statistic @xmath31 and the probability that the two data sets are drawn from the same cumulative distributions is @xmath32 .",
    "this probability does not disprove the null hypothesis .",
    "it shows that the data sets can be consistent with being drawn from a single cumulative distribution function .      the k - s statistic @xmath33 and the probability that the two data sets are drawn from the same cumulative distributions is @xmath34 .",
    "this probability is significant enough to disprove the null hypothesis .",
    "it shows that the two data sets are drawn from different cumulative distribution functions",
    ". the c / o ratios of @xcite are apparently higher than those of m dwarfs .      the k - s statistic @xmath35 and the probability that the two data sets are drawn from the same cumulative distributions is @xmath36 .",

    "it shows that the two data sets are drawn from different cumulative distribution functions .",
    "the c / o ratios of @xcite are apparently higher than those of m dwarfs .",
    "we consider that both different multiplication factors ( adopted c / o ratios of the sun ) and scatters ( dispersions in c / o values ) may be the sources of discrepancies among the c / o distributions of different works in linear scale . to isolate the effect of scatter ,",
    "we compare linear c / o ratios with respect to the sun , @xmath37}$ ] , calculated from logarithmic abundances , [ c / o ] ( = [ c / h]@xmath38[o / h ] ) obtained by differential abundance analyses . since the m dwarf distribution is the result of absolute abundance analysis , it is excluded from this comparison .",
    "the cumulative distributions are given graphically in figures 3 and 4 , and the parameters of the k - s test and corresponding panels in figures 3 and 4 are summarized in table 3      the k - s statistic @xmath39 and the probability that the two data sets are drawn from the same cumulative distributions is @xmath40 .",
    "this probability is not significant enough to disprove the null hypothesis .",
    "it shows that the data sets can be consistent with being drawn from a single cumulative distribution function .      the k - s statistic @xmath41 and the probability that the two data sets are drawn from the same cumulative distributions is @xmath42 .",

    "it shows that the data sets are drawn from different cumulative distribution functions .       the k - s statistic @xmath49 and the probability that the two data sets are drawn from the same cumulative distributions is @xmath50 .",
    "this probability does not disprove the null hypothesis .",
    "it shows that the data sets can be consistent with being drawn from a single cumulative distribution .",
    "we have seen in the  3.3 that the distribution of the c / o ratios in m dwarfs can be consistent with that of @xcite who use the solar c / o ratio of 0.58 , while it is different from those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the solar c / o ratio of 0.58 is close to 0.55 recommended by @xcite .",
    "if the c / o ratio of 0.55 is adopted for @xcite and @xcite , the k - s test with the distribution of m dwarfs gives the probabilities of both @xmath32 , while @xmath22 = 0.156 and 0.177 respectively for @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this implies that both cumulative distributions of @xcite and @xcite can be drawn from the same cumulative distribution as that of m dwarfs for this solar c / o ratio .    for the originally adopted values of solar c / o ratios ,",
    "the k - s test of cumulative distributions between @xcite and @xcite gives @xmath51 and the probability = 4.73@xmath52 .",
    "for the same k - s test between @xcite and @xcite gives @xmath53 and the probability = 3.32@xmath54 .",
    "the discrepancies between @xcite and @xcite and between @xcite and @xcite decrease ( probabilities increase ) for the cases of differential abundance analyses discussed in  3.4.4 and  3.4.5 .",
    "if the results for m dwarfs , @xcite and @xcite are correct , the c / o ratios of 0.66 and 0.63 adopted respectively by @xcite and @xcite are probably too high .",
    "since the discrepancies of cumulative distributions between @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xcite , remain in the comparison of differential analyses in  3.4 , the differences in the adopted solar c / o ratios alone do not explain these discrepancies .",
    "as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , the oxygen abundances derived from the [ oi ] 6300 forbidden line , which is blended with ni line , are most problematic .",
    "they compare the results from [ oi ] 6300 and oi 7774 triplet with non - lte correction and conclude that the scatter of oxygen abundances derived from [ oi ] 6300 is greater than that from oi 7774 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite both derive oxygen abundances from the [ oi ] 6300 forbidden line and this appears to be the major cause of the large scatter in c / o ratios .     to visualize the scatter of c / o ratios , we plot [ c / o ] vs. [ fe / h ] diagrams for @xcite and @xcite in figure 5 , and @xcite and @xcite in figure 6 .",
    "strictly speaking , @xcite give [ m / h ] instead of [ fe / h ] , but we use [ m / h ] as the substitute for [ fe / h ] .",
    "these diagrams exhibit the weak trend that c / o ratios are higher for higher [ fe / h ] , but also show the much greater scatter in figure 6 than in figure 5 .",
    "we also note that the different distributions of [ fe / h ] and t@xmath55 in the samples can contribute to the discrepancies in scatter .",
    "for example , the stars in @xcite are hotter on average than those in @xcite , while those in @xcite are more metal - rich on average .",
    "@xcite and @xcite analyze the c / o ratios in m dwarfs , indirectly from the behavior of tio and cah indices .",
    "in solar - type stars , the absorption lines of carbon and oxygen are so weak that the c / o ratio has little effect on the low resolution spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "m dwarf spectra are dominated by simple molecules such as tio , vo , and caoh , which are sensitive to the oxygen abundance available left after the formation of co molecules and thus to the c / o ratios .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite use the phoenix models @xcite to generate model m dwarf spectra for solar composition and for high c / o ratios , from which qualitative behavior of high c / o ratio stars in the tio vs. cah index diagram is derived .",
    "they find that carbon - rich stars can be identified by relatively weak tio bands for a given strength of cah",
    ". however , metal poor subdwarfs ( sdms ) exhibit similar behavior to carbon - rich stars .",
    "the work by @xcite is based on the expectation that at c / o @xmath56 1 , tio bands are not present , while c@xmath2 , cn , and ch bands should appear .",
    "he analyzes the spectroscopic catalog of nearby m dwarfs , conch - shell @xcite .",
    "he finds that all carbon - rich candidates are either metal poor stars , or have systematic errors .",
    "he estimates that m dwarfs with c / o @xmath4 1 constitute less than @xmath57 with 95% confidence",
    ". he also examines m dwarf spectra in data release 7 of sdss @xcite and sets an upper limit of @xmath8 at 99% confidence .",
    "@xcite investigate the frequency of m dwarfs with c / o = 0.9 in the solar neighborhood .",
    "they first analyze the sample from the complete spectroscopic survey of m dwarfs in the northern hemisphere @xcite , and find that only 2% of this sample could be m dwarfs with high c / o ratios , but many , if not all , are stars with low metallicity .",
    "second they analyze the sample from the pmsu survey @xcite . in this sample ,",
    "m subdwarfs ( sdm type ) are less than 1% and this fraction is consistent with the expected numbers of metal - poor ( thick disk / halo ) population estimated from kinematics .",
    "third they also analyze the sdss sample @xcite and find a similar result .",
    "they conclude that less than 1% of nearby m dwarfs have @xmath58c / o@xmath59 .    from our analysis of c / o ratios in m dwarfs and solar - type stars , the result by @xcite that m dwarfs with c / o @xmath1 1 are very rare appears",
    "to be qualitatively supported .",
    "similarly the result by @xcite that c / o @xmath4 0.9 m dwarfs are less than 1% appears to be supported too .",
    "however , the methods of analyses are so different that the comparison of the results remains only qualitative .",
    "recently carbon and oxygen abundances of 46 m dwarfs have been obtained respectively from co and h@xmath2o molecular lines @xcite .",
    "this is not a differential abundance analysis with respect to the sun .",
    "we present c / o ratios and kinematics of these m dwarfs .",
    "the distribution of c / o ratios in m dwarfs is compared with those in solar type stars obtained by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using the k - s test . the distribution c / o ratios in m dwarfs and that by @xcite are consistent with being drawn from a same distribution , while the distributions by @xcite and @xcite are not drawn from the same distribution as that in m dwarfs .",
    "high solar c / o ratios adopted by @xcite and @xcite partly explain these results .    since carbon and oxygen abundances of solar type stars have been obtained by differential analyses with respect to the sun , pairs of c / o ratio distributions with respect to the solar ratio , are compared among those by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the distributions by @xcite and @xcite are consistent and those by @xcite and @xcite are barely consistent , while other pairs are mutually inconsistent .",
    "larger scatters in c / o distributions by @xcite and @xcite are explained by the use of [ oi ] 6300 forbidden line as the abundance indicator of oxygen .",
    "we thank t. tsuji for his effort on deriving carbon and oxygen abundances in m dwarfs .",

    "<S> it has been suggested that high c / o ratios ( @xmath0 ) in circumstellar disks lead to the formation of carbon dominated planets . </S>",
    "<S> based on the expectation that elemental abundances in the stellar photospheres give the initial abundances in the circumstellar disks , the frequency distributions of c / o ratios of solar - type stars have been obtained by several groups . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these investigations are mixed . </S>",
    "<S> some find c / o @xmath10.8 in more than 20% of stars , and c / o @xmath11.0 in more than 6% . </S>",
    "<S> others find c / o @xmath0 in non of the sample stars . </S>",
    "<S> these works on solar - type stars are all differential abundance analysis with respect to the sun and depend on the adopted c / o ratio in the sun . </S>",
    "<S> recently a method of molecular line spectroscopy of m dwarfs with which carbon and oxygen abundances are derived respectively from co and h@xmath2o lines in the @xmath3 band , has been developed . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of the @xmath3 band spectra is 20,000 . </S>",
    "<S> carbon and oxygen abundances of 46 m dwarfs have been obtained by this non - differential abundance analysis . </S>",
    "<S> carbon - to - oxygen ratios in m dwarfs derived by this method are more robust than those in solar - type stars derived from neutral carbon and oxygen lines in the visible spectra due to the difficulty in the treatment of oxygen lines . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared the frequency distribution of c / o distributions in m dwarfs with those of solar - type stars and have found that low frequency of high c / o ratios is preferred . </S>"
