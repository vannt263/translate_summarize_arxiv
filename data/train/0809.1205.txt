    "scaling - law study of the capacity of wireless networks is a retreat when the exact characterization is out of reach .",
    "although it aims at lower goals , it opens an avenue of obtaining concrete results .",
    "such results are asymptotic in nature , but can be very insightful especially for networks with a large number of nodes .",
    "consider a wireless network of @xmath0 nodes , where each node is an independent source and wants to send information to some other node in the network .",
    "what are the achievable rates ? for this problem ,",
    "the seminal work @xcite showed that the multi - hop operation achieves a scaling law of @xmath1 for the total throughput .",
    "that is , on average , each source - destination pair enjoys a rate of @xmath2 , which unfortunately tends to zero as @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "this was not good news !",
    "it implies that no constant rate can be maintained for all source - destination pairs when the network size @xmath0 grows .",
    "obviously , in order to maintain a constant rate , a linear scaling @xmath3 of the throughput has to be achieved .",
    "although the multi - hop operation has indeed been the focus of much protocol development , it is well known from multi - user information theory that there are many cooperation schemes that can achieve higher rates .",
    "hence , the question remains : is linear scaling achievable , if based on multi - user cooperations ?",
    "recently , a hierarchical scheme based on multi - user cooperations was proposed in @xcite , where , it was shown that for any @xmath4 , the scaling @xmath5 is achievable under some network conditions .",
    "this is a significant improvement over the scaling @xmath1 achieved by the multi - hop operation .",
    "however , the paper @xcite can not claim that linear scaling is achievable although @xmath6 can be made arbitrarily small , due to the reason that the pre - constant of the scaling is @xmath6-dependent and actually decreases to zero as @xmath6 decreases to zero .",
    "there is a subtle difference between the scaling - law study in @xcite and the scaling - law study in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the pre - constant of the scaling is easy to determine due to the fixed link rate in the multi - hop operation , which does not change even when the network size grows .",
    "however , it is not so simple for networking strategies based on multi - user cooperations , which is the case in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in @xcite , the pre - constant was not addressed .",
    "however , negligence of the pre - constant results in incomplete pictures , and can even lead to misleading conclusions .    in @xcite , different scaling laws were claimed for dense networks ( in a fixed area ) and extended networks ( with a fixed density ) as the number of nodes goes to infinity . however , any practical network is in a fixed area , and with a fixed density .",
    "it can either be embedded into a series of increasingly denser networks , or a series of increasingly more extended networks .",
    "then , what can the two different scaling laws tell about the design and operation of this practical network if they are contradicting to each other ?",
    "well , the only explanation is that the scaling laws must be irrelevant to the design and operation of any practical network that lies in a fixed area and has a fixed density .",
    "is there anything wrong ?",
    "not really , if one takes into account the pre - constant .",
    "consider the following simple equation : @xmath7 obviously , for any @xmath8 , we can always find @xmath9 for the above equation to hold for any @xmath0 .",
    "this actually indicates that the scaling exponent @xmath10 can be made arbitrarily large if the pre - constant @xmath11 is not fixed .",
    "therefore , without addressing the pre - constant , the scaling laws claimed in @xcite are susceptible to the ambiguity indicated above .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , the way of improving the scaling exponent is by increasing the number of hierarchical layers @xmath12 , such that the corresponding scaling order @xmath13 can be arbitrarily close to linear as @xmath14 .",
    "however , the unaddressed pre - constant is actually @xmath12-dependent , and decreases to zero as @xmath12 goes to infinity as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "that is , the correct and complete expression should be @xmath15 , with @xmath16 as @xmath17 , instead of a single @xmath18 which can not uncover the whole story .",
    "the more careful study @xcite of the hierarchical scheme showed that it is not always better to choose larger @xmath12 for any fixed @xmath0 .",
    "actually , for any @xmath0 , the optimal @xmath12 to choose is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant depending on the basic sinr ( signal to interference - plus - noise ratio ) in the network .",
    "this implies that any larger @xmath12 will result in a bigger loss in @xmath21 compared to the gain from @xmath22 .",
    "it was also shown that with the optimal choice of @xmath12 and the corresponding optimal cluster sizes , the maximum achievable throughput by the hierarchical scheme is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is another constant , also depending on the basic sinr in the network .",
    "it can be easily checked that @xmath25 that is , compared to linear scaling , the throughput achieved by the hierarchical scheme is monotonely getting worse as @xmath0 increases , and the average rate per source - destination pair goes to zero .",
    "one might argue that the scaling exponent @xmath26 in does converge to 1 as @xmath27 , and thus , can be replaced by @xmath28 for arbitrarily small @xmath4 , the same as the expression in @xcite .",
    "however , note that this @xmath6 is @xmath0-dependent , and smaller @xmath6 requires larger @xmath0 , which in turn magnifies the importance of @xmath6 .",
    "this is exactly why @xmath29 becomes arbitrarily times worse than @xmath0 although the exponent does converge to 1 .",
    "but still , does this matter , if it can be claimed that any scaling of @xmath5 is achievable for any fixed @xmath4 , although the pre - constant is @xmath6-dependent , and diminishes to zero as @xmath30 ? yes , it matters , for practical design and operation of wireless networks , if the scaling law studies intend to be insightful or even relevant .",
    "first , as explained above , it becomes clear that for any practical network , it is not always better to choose more hierarchical layers .",
    "more layers do increase the exponent , but also introduce more overhead when supporting the hierarchical structure .",
    "there will be some point , beyond which , the overhead overtakes the benefit of adding more layers . as a simple example , for the case where @xmath31 , shows that the optimal number of layers for a network of 20000 nodes is 2 , i.e. , the simplest three - phase operation in the hierarchical scheme , and the corresponding throughput is @xmath32 , which actually is of the same order as that offered by the simple multi - hop operation . then whether to use the hierarchical scheme or the multi - hop scheme is completely determined by the pre - constant .",
    "moreover , even if concentrating on the limiting behavior as @xmath27 , we will show in this paper that a modification of the hierarchical scheme can achieve a throughput @xmath33 that can be arbitrarily times better than @xmath29 in the sense that @xmath34 actually , a more careful evaluation shows that @xmath35 the potential of discovering such more superior schemes may have been ignored if one overlooked the importance of @xmath6 or the pre - constant .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as the following . in section",
    "ii , we point out an immediate improvement that can be made on the hierarchical scheme proposed in @xcite , and introduce a modification .",
    "the throughput analysis and optimization of the modified scheme will be carried out in section iii , and will also be compared to the original scheme . in section iv , we discuss the drawbacks associated with the notions of `` dense '' and `` extended '' networks , so artificially coined for scaling law studies , and propose a unified and direct way of addressing the real issues . finally , some concluding remarks are presented in section v.",
    "we introduce a simple modification to the hierarchical scheme proposed in @xcite . the basic element in the modification",
    "is multiple - access .",
    "that is , multiple nodes want to send their independent bits to the same node simultaneously .",
    "however , instead of accomplishing this in one step , we use a hierarchical structure , where the bits are relayed via multiple levels of clusters until reaching the final destination . before going into the details ,",
    "let us first examine the scheme in @xcite to see where improvements can be made .",
    "the network under study consists of @xmath0 nodes .",
    "there are @xmath0 source - destination pairs evenly distributed , so that each node is a source for some other node , and also is the destination of some other source . for convenience ,",
    "let s call this the original s - d pair problem . in order to introduce cooperations ,",
    "the network is first divided into clusters , each of @xmath36 nodes .",
    "the basic element in the scheme in @xcite is the three - phase operation .",
    "that is , first a source node distributes its bits to the other nodes in the same cluster ( different bits to different nodes ) ; then , the source cluster sends all these bits to the destination cluster via the virtual mimo channel ; at last , all the nodes in the destination cluster send their quantized observations to the destination node . since all nodes are sources , the first step needs to be carried out @xmath36 times for all the nodes in the source cluster , which constitute phase 1 ; similarly since all nodes are destinations , the last step also needs to be carried out @xmath36 times for all the nodes in the destination cluster , which constitute phase 3 ; moreover , the second step needs to be carried out @xmath0 times for @xmath0 s - d pairs , which constitute phase 2 .",
    "note that in each cluster of @xmath36 nodes , phase 1 can actually be decomposed into @xmath37 original s - d pair problems with non - overlapping destination distributions ; and similarly can phase 3 be decomposed .",
    "it is exactly this observation which leads to the hierarchical structure proposed in @xcite , where , both phase 1 and phase 3 can be replaced by another three - phase operation with smaller sub - clusters of size @xmath38 .",
    "then again , the phases 1 and 3 of the sub - clusters can be replaced by another three - phase operation with even smaller sub - sub - clusters .",
    "this process is continued , with each phase 1 or phase 3 being replaced by a three - phase operation with smaller clusters , and the hierarchy is built .",
    "our modification arises from a different perspective on phase 1 and phase 3 .",
    "although they can be decomposed into a sequence of the original s - d problems , they are essentially a problem where every node wants to send to every other node an independent message . from the receiver point of view",
    ", each node sees the other nodes trying to send independent messages to it via a multiple - access channel .",
    "hence , with this new perspective , in a cluster of @xmath39 nodes , both phase 1 and phase 3 can be carried out by @xmath39 multiple - access operations . since this is a task where there are multiple - accesses to all the nodes , it is convenient to name it the all - way multiple - access problem .",
    "the advantage with this new perspective is that with cluster cooperation , the all - way multiple - access problem can be accomplished in two - steps , instead of three .",
    "that is , first the nodes in any one cluster send their bits to the destination cluster via the virtual mimo channel ; then all the nodes in the destination cluster send their quantized observations to the destination node .",
    "in other words , the first step of one node distributing its bits is not longer necessary , because now every node has something to transmit to the same destination . correspondingly , the hierarchy proposed in @xcite can be modified as in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "compared to the figure 3 in @xcite , the difference is the elimination of all the phase 1 s from the hierarchy , except on the top layer , where the problem is still the original s - d pair problem , which can not be turned into a multiple - access problem .        as stated in @xcite ,",
    "the functionality of phase 1 is for a node to distribute its bits to the other nodes in the cluster , in order to establish a virtual multi - antenna transmitter for the mimo communication in phase 2 .",
    "however , in retrospect , since different bits are distributed to different nodes , there is essentially no mutual understanding among these nodes when they are transmitting together to the destination cluster",
    ". therefore it may be more accurate to think of phase 2 as a multiple - access communication with a virtual receive cluster . with this in mind",
    ", then it becomes obvious that phase 2 can be directly carried out without the preparation of phase 1 if the problem is already multiple - access .",
    "the same modification with a multiple - access perspective has also appeared in @xcite in the context of minimizing delay .",
    "however , the authors there simply claim that the modified scheme achieves the same throughput as the original scheme in @xcite , largely due to the negligence of the @xmath6 as we explained in the introduction . in next section",
    ", we will show that the modified scheme can achieve a throughput arbitrarily higher than the original scheme as the network size @xmath0 grows .",
    "in this section , we analyze the optimal throughput achievable by the modified hierarchical scheme proposed in last section .",
    "the procedure is similar to that in @xcite when analyzing the original hierarchical scheme of @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the improvement can be arbitrarily times large as the network size @xmath0 grows to infinity , i.e. , @xmath40 where , @xmath33 is the optimal throughput by the modified scheme , and @xmath29 is the optimal throughput by the original scheme .",
    "a more careful evaluation even shows that @xmath35 however , still , the average rate per s - d pair goes to zero as @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath41    since the analysis procedure is similar to that in @xcite , we only highlight the differences here . note that the top layer of the hierarchy remains the same .",
    "the key issue is to determine the time needed to accomplish the all - way multiple - access problem in phase 1 and phase 3 of the top layer .",
    "as defined in last section , the all - way multiple - access problem under study can be stated as the following .",
    "consider a network of size @xmath36 , where , every node wants to send @xmath42 bits to every other node in the network .",
    "( different bits for different pair , i.e. , totally , @xmath43 bits .",
    "however , for simplicity and without loss of much accuracy when @xmath36 is large , we use @xmath43 in the calculation .",
    "this approximation wo nt affect the scaling order . ] need to be communicated . )",
    "the question is how long it takes to accomplish the task ?",
    "we use the modified two - phase operation scheme to accomplish the task .",
    "first , we build the hierarchical structure .",
    "divide these @xmath36 nodes into clusters of size @xmath38 ; then divide each cluster of @xmath38 nodes into smaller clusters of size @xmath44 ; continue this process @xmath45 times for some @xmath46 , and finally we obtain clusters of size @xmath47 .",
    "we will determine the optimal value of @xmath12 to stop , i.e. , the optimal number of hierarchical layers , and also the optimal cluster sizes @xmath38 , @xmath44 , @xmath48 , @xmath47 in the sequel .",
    "obviously , the number of time slots needed to accomplish the all - way multiple - access problem with the above hierarchical structure depends on the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath36 , @xmath38 , @xmath48 , @xmath47 , @xmath42 , and therefore , is denoted by @xmath49 we ll use a recurrence relation to determine .",
    "first , note that the all - way multiple - access problem of the network of size @xmath36 is accomplished in two phases : phase 2 and phase 3 , with clusters of size @xmath38 .",
    "the number of time slots needed for phase 2 is simply @xmath50 , as calculated in @xcite , where @xmath24 is the basic rate . in phase 3",
    ", it is again the all - way multiple - access problem for networks of smaller size @xmath38 , but now , with @xmath51 bits to be communicated between each pair of nodes .",
    "hence , we have the relation @xmath52 \\\\ = \\frac{m_1}{m_2}2m_1\\frac{l}{r}+4 d_{h-2}(m_2,\\ldots , m_{h-1},l\\frac{q}{r } \\frac{m_1}{m_2 } ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the multiplier @xmath53 is needed for time - sharing between neighboring clusters to avoid excessive interference .    in turn",
    ", we have the following relation @xmath54 \\\\ = \\frac{m_2}{m_3}2m_2\\frac{l}{r}\\frac{q}{r}\\frac{m_1}{m_2}+4 d_{h-3}(m_3,\\ldots , m_{h-1},l\\frac{q}{r } \\frac{m_1}{m_2}\\frac{q}{r}\\frac{m_2}{m_3 } ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] and similar recursive relations for @xmath55 , @xmath56 and so on .",
    "hence , recursively , @xmath52 \\\\ = \\frac{m_1}{m_2}2m_1\\frac{l}{r } \\\\ [ -2 mm ] \\\\ \\quad + 4\\frac{m_2}{m_3}2m_2\\frac{l}{r}\\frac{q}{r}\\frac{m_1}{m_2 } \\\\ [ -2 mm ] \\\\ \\quad + 4 ^ 2\\frac{m_3}{m_4}2m_3\\frac{l}{r}(\\frac{q}{r})^2\\frac{m_1}{m_3 } \\\\ [ -2 mm ]",
    "\\\\ \\quad + \\cdots \\\\ [ -2 mm ] \\\\ \\quad + 4^{h-3}\\frac{m_{h-2}}{m_{h-1}}2m_{h-2}\\frac{l}{r}(\\frac{q}{r})^{h-3}\\frac{m_1}{m_{h-2 } } \\\\ [ -2 mm ] \\\\ \\quad + 4^{h-2}d_1(m_{h-1},l(\\frac{q}{r})^{h-2}\\frac{m_1}{m_{h-1 } } ) . \\end{array}\\ ] ]    for the smallest clusters of size @xmath47 , the all - way multiple - access problem is accomplished directly without the two - phase operation , and thus @xmath57 therefore , letting @xmath58 , @xmath59    for any fixed @xmath36 , to minimize the sum in the parenthesis above , noting that the product of all those terms is @xmath60 obviously , the optimal choice is that every term equals to @xmath61 this leads to the optimal choices of cluster sizes : @xmath62 and the minimum number of time slots : @xmath63    therefore , on the top layer , the number of time slots needed for phase 1 is @xmath64 the number of time slots needed for phase 3 is @xmath65 and the number of time slots needed for phase 2 is still @xmath66 , the same as the original scheme .",
    "after these time slots , the number of bits transported for each s - d pair is @xmath67 , and the total number of bits transported in the whole network is @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the throughput is calculated as @xmath69 it is easy to find the optimal choice of @xmath36 by setting @xmath70 , and we have @xmath71^{-\\frac{h-1}{h } } n^{\\frac{h-1}{h}}\\ ] ] and the corresponding throughput @xmath72    for any fixed @xmath0 , we can find the optimal @xmath12 to maximize @xmath73 by setting @xmath74 this leads to @xmath75=0.\\ ] ] hence , the optimal number of layers to choose is @xmath76}-1}{2\\ln(2\\sqrt{q / r})}.\\ ] ] similarly as in @xcite , in order to obtain a simple formula , we use the approximation @xmath77 which is very accurate for large @xmath0 .",
    "letting @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 note that @xmath80 therefore , @xmath81 where letting @xmath82 , we have the optimal throughput @xmath83 where @xmath84 obviously , is very accurate for large @xmath0 , although we made some approximation in and @xmath85 should always be an integer",
    ".    hence , we arrive at the following theorem .    with the modified hierarchical scheme , by choosing the optimal number of layers as and the corresponding optimal cluster sizes as and , the optimal throughput is given by .    without the approximation ,",
    "we can also obtain an exact upper bound of the throughput as the following . by ,",
    "@xmath86 where , in the last inequality , `` @xmath87 '' holds if @xmath88 .",
    "it is easy to check that with the modified hierarchical scheme , the average rate per s - d pair still goes to zero as @xmath89   \\\\ & \\rightarrow & 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however , the modified scheme can be arbitrarily times better than the original one in @xcite , as can be checked with @xmath90   \\\\ & \\rightarrow & \\infty,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath29 is the optimal throughput of the original scheme as calculated in @xcite with @xmath91 , and thus , @xmath92 . actually , we can show an even stronger result that @xmath93 since @xmath94",
    "the analysis in last section has assumed a fixed basic rate @xmath24 in order to focus on the scaling in terms of @xmath0 . while this is the case under some channel gain model for the so - called dense networks , where networks are confined in a fixed area even as the number of nodes grows to infinity , it is not so easy to maintain a fixed basic rate for networks with growing areas , due to the power path loss .",
    "therefore , when addressing the so - called extended networks , where the node density is fixed while the area grows proportionally to the number of nodes , @xcite proposed the trick of concentrating the total transmission power into a small portion of the total transmission time to compensate for the path loss , so that during that portion , the received sinr is maintained at a specific level .",
    "then , with the following power path loss model : @xmath95 i.e. , the received power @xmath96 depends on the transmitted power @xmath97 via the transmitter - receiver distance @xmath98 and the path - loss exponent @xmath99 , the scaling for extended networks readily follows by multiplying all the results above with the factor @xmath100 .",
    "namely , to compensate for the power path loss , the transmitted power needs be @xmath101 times larger , i.e. , @xmath102 times larger considering long - hop distances in an area proportional to @xmath0 . since the required power level is @xmath103 for dense networks , the hierarchical scheme can only be operated in @xmath104 portion of the time for extended networks to satisfy the total power constraint , which leads to the multiplication of the same factor to all the scaling law results obtained previously .    more generally ,",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the same trick can be played on networks with any area other than either fixed , or linear growing .",
    "that is , a network with area @xmath105 is distinguished into two categories based on whether @xmath106 in the case where @xmath107 , the basic sinr can be maintained all the time , and the power - concentration trick is not needed ; in the other case where @xmath108 , the power - concentration trick is needed to maintain the basic sinr for @xmath109 portion of the time , and all the results correspondingly need to be multiplied by the same factor . for example , the formula should be modified as @xmath110 in @xcite , these two categories are respectively named as `` dense '' and `` sparse '' networks .",
    "note that this is a notion that can be readily clarified on any specific network based on the relation between the area @xmath105 and the number of nodes @xmath0 , different from the previous notion of `` dense '' and `` extended '' networks that is undetermined for any single network .",
    "however , one has to realize that this new notion is largely a consequence of the hierarchical scheme , and is also related to the path - loss exponent .",
    "a recent work @xcite proposes to address the intermediate regime between dense and extended networks by introducing a more general pattern of area scaling as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a real number , with @xmath113 corresponding to dense networks , and @xmath114 corresponding to extended networks .",
    "although it seems more general by the flexibility of choosing different values for @xmath112 , it is still artificial to make the network area scale according to the pattern .",
    "the ambiguity of determining the right embedding process for any specific network still remains , as we pointed out in the introduction .",
    "above all , the motivation of studying the capacity of wireless networks is clear : to provide insight and guidance on the practical design and operation of such networks .",
    "after the explicit determination of the pre - constant , it is clear that the throughput formulas such as hold for any finite number @xmath0 , and the scaling laws are just a consequence of letting @xmath27 . if the practical problem under study is a specific network with a specific area and a specific number of nodes , then obviously , it is more natural and insightful to apply the formula directly rather than to consult the scaling laws thereafter derived .",
    "so probably , one should not be concerned with the scaling laws so much as the exact throughput formula itself .    note",
    "that in the formula , the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 also affect the throughput , and they are determined by the basic sinr , which in turn , is determined by the long - hop path loss .",
    "therefore , for the flexibility of selecting different basic sinrs , the criterion should be modified as @xmath117 and the corresponding optimal throughput is modified as @xmath118 where , @xmath119 is a constant , chosen to set the threshold of the basic sinr , and thus the values of the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "generally , smaller @xmath119 leads to larger basic rate @xmath24 ; however , smaller @xmath119 may also make the condition unsatisfied , and thus lead to the scale - down factor @xmath120 in , as a result of the power concentration trick .",
    "hence , there is a basic tradeoff in choosing @xmath119 when maximizing .",
    "apparently , the afore - mentioned notions of `` dense '' and `` sparse '' networks derived via the criterion are rather arbitrary and scheme - dependent than fundamental .    in summary , presents the optimal throughput achievable by the modified hierarchical scheme for a network of @xmath0 nodes and area @xmath105 .",
    "this is all we need to know .",
    "based on this , all kinds of scaling laws can be derived by setting different limits . now",
    "the question is really how good is , for any possible values of @xmath0 and @xmath105 , not just when @xmath27 .",
    "we have presented a simple example in the introduction showing that this is a question even when only compared to the multi - hop scheme . in general , we note that the upper bounds obtained in @xcite apply to any finite network with specific @xmath0 and @xmath105 , and in fact encompass more general traffic patterns with the criterion of transport capacity , which allows unequal rates and uneven s - d distributions .",
    "caution on the pre - constant is needed when deriving scaling laws for wireless networks , especially with multi - user cooperation schemes where the overhead may not be negligible .",
    "based on explicit analysis of the pre - constant , we have shown that a modified hierarchical scheme can achieve a throughput arbitrarily times higher than the original one , although it is still diminishingly lower compared to the linear scaling .",
    "this leaves the question open whether it is possible to maintain a constant rate between each s - d pair when the number of nodes grows to infinity .",
    "on the other hand , rather than the scaling laws , we have demonstrated the pivotal importance of the throughput formula itself as a function of the network parameters .",
    "we emphasize that all scaling laws can be derived from this formula , and more importantly , it is this formula that is directly related to practice .",
