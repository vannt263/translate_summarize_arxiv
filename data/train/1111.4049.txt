    "black holes are by far the most celebrated class of solutions derived from einstein s field equations . being among the first types of solutions to be found almost a century ago , they have undergone an extensive investigation over the years .",
    "their existence conditions , forms of solutions and set of properties have been studied in the context of both traditional general relativity and generalized gravitational theories admitting either four or more dimensions .",
    "the most well - known example of such a generalized gravitational theory in four dimensions is provided by the low - energy heterotic string effective theory @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the scalar curvature term of einstein s theory is only one part of a more complex action functional where higher - curvature gravitational terms as well as kinetic and interaction terms of a variety of additional fields ( axions , fermions and gauge fields ) make their appearance .",
    "the dilatonic einstein - gauss - bonnet theory is a minimal version of the aforementioned theory and contains the scalar curvature term @xmath0 , a scalar field called the dilaton , and a quadratic curvature term , the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term , given by @xmath1 . the gb term in four dimensions can be expressed as a total derivative term and , normally , makes no contribution to the field equations ; however , the exponential coupling to the dilaton field , that emerges in the context of the dilatonic einstein - gauss - bonnet theory , ensures that the gb term is kept in the theory .",
    "in the framework of the dilatonic einstein - gauss - bonnet theory , new types of black hole solutions emerged that are endowed with non - trivial dilaton hair ( for an indicative list of works on this topic , see @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of the gb term in the theory caused the circumvention of the traditional no - hair theorems as it bypassed the conditions for their validity .",
    "in reality , the existence of the dilatonic black holes violated only the ` letter ' of the no - hair theorems , and not the ` essence ' of them since the dilaton charge was of a ` secondary ' type . however , it became evident that in the context of this type of generalized gravitational theories solutions with a much richer structure and a modified set of properties , compared to the ones in general relativity , can emerge .",
    "another class of gravitational solutions whose properties are strictly set by the general theory of relativity are wormholes .",
    "they were first discovered in 1935 as a feature of schwarzschild geometry @xcite and named the ` einstein - rosen bridge ' as they connect two different universes .",
    "their importance was realised in full when wheeler @xcite showed that such a bridge , or wormhole , can connect also two distant regions of our own universe thus opening the way for fast interstellar travel .",
    "however , it was soon demonstrated that this is not possible for the following reasons : ( i ) the schwarzschild wormhole is hidden inside the event horizon of the corresponding black hole , therefore , is not static but evolves with time ; as a result , the circumference of its ` throat ' is not constant but opens and closes so quickly that not even a light signal can pass through @xcite , ( ii ) even if a traveler could somehow pass the throat , she would be bound to exit the wormhole through the past horizon of the schwarzschild geometry ; this horizon was shown to be unstable against small perturbations and that it would change to a proper , and thus non - traversable , horizon at the mere approaching of the traveler @xcite .",
    "in @xcite a new class of wormhole solutions was found that possess no horizon and could in principle be traversable . however , some form of exotic matter whose energy - momentum tensor had to violate all ( null , weak and strong ) energy conditions was necessary in order to keep the throat of the wormhole open .",
    "several studies have considered a phantom field , i.e. a scalar field with a reversed sign in front of its kinetic term , as a candidate for such a form of matter @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that the gb term leads to an effective energy - momentum tensor that also violates the energy conditions .",
    "it is in fact this violation that causes the circumvention of the no - hair theorem forbidding the existence of regular black holes with non - trivial scalar hair .",
    "it was noted recently in @xcite , too , that the presence of the gb term in the context of a scalar - tensor theory has the property to evade the various no - go theorems of general relativity .",
    "indeed , various wormhole solutions were found in the context of gravitational theories with higher curvature terms @xcite . in the presence of the gauss - bonnet term in particular ,",
    "wormhole solutions were found in the context of higher - dimensional gravitational theories @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will investigate the properties of wormhole solutions that arise in the context of the four - dimensional dilatonic einstein - gauss - bonnet theory , first reported in @xcite .",
    "the presence of the higher - curvature gb term , that follows naturally from the compactification of the 10-dimensional heterotic superstring theory down to four dimensions , suffices to support these types of solutions without the need for phantom scalar fields or other forms of exotic matter .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : in section ii , we present the theoretical context of our model and discuss the asymptotic forms of the sought - for wormhole solutions at the regions of radial infinity and the regular throat . based on the latter , we derive the embedding diagram and study the violation of the energy conditions .",
    "we also present a smarr relation for the wormhole solutions . in section iii , we present the results of our numerical analysis that reveal the existence of wormhole solutions in the dilatonic einstein - gauss - bonnet theory , and discuss their properties .",
    "we demonstrate the stability with respect to radial perturbations of a subset of these solutions in section iv . in section",
    "v we discuss the junction conditions .",
    "the geodesics in these wormhole spacetimes are presented in section vi .",
    "we calculate the magnitude of the acceleration and tidal forces that a traveler traversing the wormhole would feel in section vii , and conclude in section viii .",
    "we consider the following effective action @xcite motivated by the low - energy heterotic string theory @xcite @xmath2 , \\label{act}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the dilaton field with coupling constant @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a positive numerical coefficient given in terms of the regge slope parameter , and @xmath6 is the gb correction .",
    "the dilaton and einstein equations are given by @xmath7 \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\alpha e^{-\\gamma \\phi }   \\left [   h_{\\mu\\nu }    + 4\\left(\\gamma^2\\nabla^\\rho \\phi \\nabla^\\sigma \\phi             -\\gamma",

    "thus we can write the spacetime line - element in the form @xcite @xmath9    as was demonstrated in @xcite , the dilatonic - einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egbd ) theory admits black hole solutions whose gravitational background has the line - element of eq .",
    "( [ metrics ] ) .",
    "it was also shown that further classes of solutions emerge in the context of the same theory .",
    "one of them , in particular , possesses no curvature singularity and no proper horizon ( with @xmath10 being regular over the whole radial regime ) . however , the @xmath11 metric component as well as the dilaton field showed some pathological behavior at a finite radius @xmath12 , as seen from the expansion near @xmath13 @xcite @xmath14 the absence of any singular behaviour of the curvature invariants at @xmath13 signifies that the aforementioned pathological behaviour is merely due to the particular choice of the coordinate system .    in @xcite",
    "we have argued that this class of asymptotically flat solutions can be brought to a regular form by employing the coordinate transformation @xmath15 .",
    "then , the metric becomes @xmath16 the above form is regular and describes a wormhole solution , where @xmath13 is the radius of the throat .",
    "indeed , in terms of the new coordinate @xmath17 , the expansion at @xmath18 assumes the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constant coefficients , and shows no pathology . both metric functions and the dilaton field remain finite in this asymptotic regime .",
    "thus these solutions possess no horizon .",
    "in addition , all curvature invariant quantities  including the gb term  turn out to be finite at @xmath18 , a result that demonstrates the absence of any singularity .",

    "( [ expansion - throat1])-([expansion - throat3 ] ) , once substituted into the set of equations leads to a number of recursive constraints that determine the higher - order coefficients in terms of the lower ones .",
    "looking at the lowest order , we observe that @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are free parameters . also , the set of parameters of the theory includes the radius of the throat @xmath13 and the value of @xmath36 .",
    "the value of the constant @xmath4 will be later fixed to 1 for simplicity .",
    "however , not all of the above parameters are actually independent . to start with ,",
    "we observe that the field equations remain invariant under the simultaneous changes @xmath37 in addition , the following transformation @xmath38 is also a symmetry of the equations . in the light of the above ,",
    "we conclude that only one parameter out of the set @xmath39 is independent .",
    "we may therefore choose to have a zero asymptotic value of the dilaton field at infinity which entails fixing the value of the dilaton field at the throat @xmath35 .",
    "the remaining two parameters can be combined to give a dimensionless parameter @xmath40 that will be used throughout our analysis .",
    "finally , among the two parameters associated with the metric functions , ( @xmath34 , @xmath33 ) , again only the latter is independent  it is only the derivatives of the metric function @xmath31 that appear in the field equations of motion , therefore , we may use this freedom to fix the value of @xmath34 in order to ensure asymptotic flatness at radial infinity .",
    "thus , our class of wormholes is a two - parameter family of solutions that , in the context of our analysis , have been chosen to be @xmath33 and @xmath40 .",
    "when the expansion of the metric functions and dilaton field near the throat ( [ expansion - throat1])-([expansion - throat3 ] ) are substituted into the field equations , we obtain a set of constraints on the higher - order coefficients . the constraint on the value of the first derivative of the dilaton field at the throat",

    "we may easily see that the expression inside the square brackets in the denominator remains positive and has no roots if @xmath42 this inequality is automatically satisfied for the set of wormhole solutions presented in the next section , and gives a lower limit on the size of the throat of the wormhole @xmath13 .",
    "then , the positivity of the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ constraint - phi1 ] ) demands that @xmath43 .",
    "the solutions satisfying @xmath44 comprise a boundary in the phase space of the wormhole solutions and their physical significance will be discussed in the next section .",
    "as already discussed above , at the asymptotic regime of radial infinity , i.e. as @xmath45 , we demand asymptotic flatness for the two metric functions and a vanishing value of the dilaton field .",
    "then , the asymptotic expansion at infinity takes the form @xmath46 in the above , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are identified with the mass and dilaton charge of the wormhole , respectively .",
    "we remind the reader that in the case of the black hole solutions @xcite , the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 were related , and that rendered the dilatonic hair as `` secondary '' . however , in the case of the wormhole solutions these parameters are not related ; this result , together with the fact that the number of independent parameters near the throat is also two , confirms the classification of this group of solutions as a two - parameter class of solutions .",
    "a general property of a wormhole is the existence of a throat , i.  e.  a surface of minimal area ( or minimal radius for spherically symmetric spacetimes ) .",
    "indeed , this property is implied by the form of the line element ( [ metricl ] ) above , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 finite . to cast this condition in a coordinate independent way",
    ", we define the proper distance from the throat in the following way @xmath51 if we impose the condition for a minimal radius @xmath52 at @xmath18 , this translates to @xmath53 it is easily seen that the first condition is indeed satisfied . for the second condition",
    "we find @xmath54 this gives a coordinate independent meaning to the parameter @xmath33 , @xmath55^{-1 } \\ .\\ ] ]    a particularly useful concept with which we may examine the geometry of a given manifold is the construction of the corresponding embedding diagram . in the present case , we consider the isometric embedding of a plane passing through the wormhole . due to the spherical symmetry of the solutions",
    ", we may simplify the analysis and choose @xmath56 .",
    "then , we set @xmath57 where @xmath58 are a set of cylindrical coordinates in the three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath59 . regarding @xmath60 and @xmath61 as functions of @xmath17 , we find @xmath62 from the last equation it follows that @xmath63 hence @xmath64 is a parametric representation of a slice of the embedded @xmath56-plane for a fixed value of @xmath65 .",
    "we observe that the curvature radius of the curve @xmath64 at @xmath18 is given by @xmath66 .",
    "thus @xmath33 has a geometric meaning : @xmath67 is the ratio of the curvature radius to the radius of the throat .",
    "as was already mentioned in the introduction , the existence of the wormhole solution relies on the violation of the null energy condition .",
    "the null energy condition holds if @xmath68 for any null vector field @xmath69 . in the particular case of spherically symmetric solutions , and if we employ the einstein equations , this condition can be expressed as @xmath70 if one or both of the above conditions do not hold in some region of spacetime , then the null energy condition is violated . by making use of the expansion of the fields near the throat ( [ expansion - throat1])-([expansion - throat3 ] )",
    ", we find that , close to @xmath13 , @xmath71_{l=0 } = -\\frac{2}{f_0 r_0 ^ 2 } < 0 \\ ,   \\label{eng_pert_cond}\\ ] ] provided @xmath72 , i.e.  in the absence of a horizon .",
    "thus for the wormhole solutions there is always a region close to the throat where the null energy condition is violated .    on the other hand , from the asymptotic expansion of the solutions at infinity",
    ", we find @xmath73 we observe that , for solutions with a positive dilaton charge @xmath48 ( and a positive mass @xmath47 ) the null energy condition is satisfied in the asymptotic region . however , if the dilaton charge is negative , the null energy condition is violated also in that asymptotic region .",
    "note that @xmath74 for the black hole solutions , where it was given by a positive - definite combination of @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath74 does not necessarily hold for all of the wormhole solutions .      to derive the smarr - like mass formula for the wormhole solutions we start with the definition of the komar mass @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the timelike killing vector field",
    ", @xmath78 is a spacelike hypersurface , @xmath79 is a normal vector on @xmath78 and @xmath80 is the natural volume element on @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath81 denotes the contribution of the throat , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the area of the throat , and @xmath84 is the surface gravity at the throat @xmath85    to obtain the mass formula we express @xmath86 in terms of the effective stress energy tensor @xmath87\\ , , \\label{r00_th}\\ ] ] where we have added a zero in the form of the dilaton equation .",
    "multiplication by @xmath88 yields @xmath89 substitution of the metric yields a total derivative for the right - hand - side of the above equation .",
    "thus , after integration , we find @xmath90    now substitution into eq .",
    "( [ m_adm ] ) gives the smarr - like formula @xmath91 with @xmath92 here @xmath93 is the induced spatial metric on the throat , @xmath94 is the scalar curvature of @xmath93 , and the integral is evaluated at @xmath18 .",
    "defining the normal vector @xmath95 on the surface @xmath18 the mass formula becomes @xmath96 with @xmath97 according to the above , the smarr - like mass formula for wormholes is obtained by replacing the horizon properties by the corresponding throat properties in the known egbd mass formula for black holes @xcite . in addition , an extra contribution appears that may be interpreted as a modified throat dilaton charge , while the gb modification is of the same type as the gb modification of the area ( or entropy in the case of black holes ) .",
    "for the numerical calculations we use the line - element ( [ metricl ] ) , since the functions are well behaved at @xmath13 . for the representation of the numerical results we employ the metric ( [ metrics ] ) as well .    to solve the odes numerically ,",

    "the aforementioned result could perhaps have been anticipated since our analysis is performed within the context of superstring theory , a theory whose fundamental scale is tied to the planck scale .",
    "[ fig_acc ]    next we turn to the tidal acceleration that a traveler feels between two parts of her body as the wormhole is crossed .",
    "let @xmath355 be the vector separation between these two parts , which in the reference frame of the traveler is purely spatial , @xmath356 .",
    "then , the tidal acceleration is given by the expression @xcite @xmath357 where @xmath358 takes on only spatial values and where we have used that @xmath359 .",
    "but since the metric is diagonal and the riemann tensor is antisymmetric in the first two indices , the superscript @xmath360 should also take only spatial values",
    ". then , the non - vanishing components of the tidal acceleration are : @xmath361 the transformation laws ( [ trans1 ] ) and ( [ trans2 ] ) allow us to compute the components of the riemann tensor in the orthonormal frame of the moving observer in terms of the ones in the @xmath339 coordinates .",
    "we then obtain @xmath362 similarly , we find : @xmath363\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as in the case of the acceleration , we should demand that the magnitude of the above components should be small , i.e. of the order of the acceleration of gravity at the surface of the earth . using the fact that @xmath364 , the above constraints may be written as @xmath365 \\frac{\\gamma^2}{r_0 ^ 2+l^2 } \\left|\\frac{l\\nu'}{f}+\\frac{v^2}{c^2 f}\\,\\left(\\frac{l f'}{2f}- \\frac{r_0 ^ 2}{r_0 ^ 2+l^2}\\right)\\right|   & \\leq & \\frac{g_\\oplus}{c^2 ( 2\\,{\\rm m})}=\\frac{1}{(10^{10 } { \\rm cm})^2}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second inequality involves the velocity with which the traveler moves and thus may be considered as a constraint on this quantity .",
    "the first inequality restricts again the profile of the metric functions - a similar analysis to the one above leads to the same results regarding the magnitude of the tidal forces and the necessary size of the throat in order to bring these down to a reasonable value .",
    "the existence of traversable wormholes in the context of general relativity relies on the presence of some form of exotic matter .",
    "however , in the framework of a string - inspired generalized theory of gravity , the situation may be completely different . here",
    "we have investigated wormhole solutions in egbd theory , which corresponds to a simplified action that is motivated by the low - energy heterotic string theory .",
    "indeed , as we have demonstrated , egbd theory allows for stable , traversable wormhole solutions , without the need of introducing any form of exotic matter .",
    "the violation of the energy conditions , that is essential for the existence of the wormhole solutions , gravitational theories , where @xmath366 is the torsion , without the energy conditions being violated . ]",
    "is realized via the presence of an effective energy - momentum tensor generated by the quadratic - in - curvature gauss - bonnet term .",
    "we have determined the domain of existence of these wormhole solutions and shown that it is bounded by three sets of limiting solutions .",
    "the first boundary consists of the egbd black hole solutions of @xcite .",
    "the second boundary is approached asymptotically , when the curvature radius at the throat of the wormhole diverges ( the @xmath129 limit ) . finally , at the third boundary",
    ", solutions with a curvature singularity at a finite distance from the throat are encountered .",
    "we have investigated the properties of these egbd wormholes and derived a smarr - like mass relation for them . in this , the horizon properties in the black hole case are replaced by the corresponding throat properties of the wormholes , thus the area and surface gravity here refer to the ones at the throat . moreover , as is well - known for black holes in egb theories , their entropy does not correspond merely to their horizon area but it receives a gb correction term . similarly , we find that the mass formula for the wormhole solutions includes an analogous gb correction term ; in addition , another term , that vanishes in the black hole case , appears that represents the gb corrected dilaton charge at the throat .",
    "we have demonstrated that the smarr relation is satisfied very well by the numerical solutions .",
    "we have also investigated the stability of the solutions .",
    "we have shown that a subset of our wormhole solutions , the one that lies close to the border with the linearly stable dilatonic black holes in the domain of existence , is also linearly stable with respect to radial perturbations .",
    "while we have also shown that another subset is unstable , we have concluded that the study of the standard equivalent schrdinger equation can not determine the stability for the full domain of existence we hope to resume the question of the existence of an alternative method for the study of the stability of all of our wormhole solutions at some future work .",
    "when the wormhole solutions are extended to the second asymptotically flat region , this extension must be made in a symmetric way , since otherwise a singularity is encountered .",
    "as a consequence of this symmetric extension , the derivatives of the metric and dilaton functions become discontinuous at the throat .",
    "this discontinuity demands the introduction of some matter distribution at the throat .",
    "we have shown that this may be realized by the introduction of a perfect fluid at the throat whose energy density is positive for the subset of stable wormhole solutions .",
    "next , we have studied and classified the geodesics of massive and massless test particles in these wormhole spacetimes . depending on the respective effective potential",
    ", there are two general kinds of trajectories for these particles .",
    "the particles may remain on bound or escape orbits within a single asymptotically flat part of the spacetime , or they may travel from one asymptotically flat part to the other on escape orbits , and travel back and forth on bound orbits .",
    "in addition , we have calculated the acceleration and tidal forces which travelers traversing the wormhole would feel .",
    "we find that their magnitude may be small for fairly large values of the size of the throat of the wormhole .",
    "according to our findings , the radius of the wormhole throat is bounded from below only , therefore , the wormholes can be indeed arbitrarily large .",
    "astrophysical consequences will be addressed in a forthcoming paper as well as the existence of stationary rotating wormhole solutions in the egbd theory .",
