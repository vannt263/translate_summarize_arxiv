    "recently , using the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) , the first ( and so far only ) accretion - powered millisecond x - ray pulsar was discovered ( wijnands & van der klis 1998a ; 1998b ) .",
    "this source is positionally coincident with the known transient x - ray burster and low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) sax j1808.43658 ( in t zand et al .",
    "1998 ; marshall 1998 ) , making it the first source which exhibits coherent x - ray pulsations and thermonuclear x - ray bursts .",
    "the pulsar is in an @xmath02 hour binary with a companion star of less than 0.1 m@xmath1 ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998a ; 1998b ) .",
    "this discovery verified the twenty - year old prediction that the progenitors of the millisecond radio pulsars are lmxbs ( see bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 for a review of millisecond radio pulsars ) , for which a lot of circumstantial evidence was already present ( see wijnands & van der klis 1998b for references ) .",
    "the derived magnetic field of the millisecond x - ray pulsar is in the range of the fields of the millisecond radio pulsars ( wijnands & van der klis 1998b ; chakrabarty & morgan 1998b ; gilfanov et al .",
    "1998 ; cui et al .",
    "1998 ) , but it is lower than that estimated for some other lmxbs using indirect methods ( see wijnands & van der klis 1998b for references ) .",
    "it is therefore not clear why other lmxbs , particularly those at similarly low accretion rates as sax j1808.43658 , are not also millisecond pulsars",
    ". perhaps previous field estimates are wrong and the magnetic fields in the other lmxbs are lower than that in sax j1808.43658 , or perhaps in sax j1808.43658 some special geometric condition , such as low inclination or large spin and magnetic axis misalignment , uniquely allows it to pulse .",
    "in this letter we study the rapid aperiodic x - ray variability of this millisecond x - ray pulsar and compare it with that of other low - luminosity lmxbs .",
    "we conclude that apart from the pulsations the rapid variability of sax j1808.43658 is very similar to that of other low - luminosity neutron star lmxbs ; we do , however , identify one possible unusual aspect .",
    "during the decay of its april 1998 outburst sax j1808.43658 was frequently observed with the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) until may 6 ( fig .",
    "[ parameters]a ; see also gilfanov et al .",
    "1998 ; heindl & smith 1998 ; cui et al .",
    "1998 ) . during these observations data were collected with a time resolution of 122 @xmath2s in 64 channels , except on april 13th when a mode with 1 @xmath2s in 256 channels was used .",
    "we used these data to calculate 512 second ffts .",
    "after subtraction of the deadtime - modified poisson level , the resulting 0.0044096 hz power density spectra were averaged to form 21 different spectra , one for each observation ( although some observations were combined in order to increase sensitivity ) .",
    "each average spectrum contains between 1 and 23 ksec of data .",
    "the spectra were fitted with a fit function that is described in section [ results ] .",
    "the errors on the fit parameters were calculated using @xmath3 .",
    "the upper limits were calculated using @xmath4 , corresponding to 95% confidence levels .",
    "a typical power density spectrum of sax j1808.43658 is shown in fig .",
    "[ comparison]a . besides the very significant periodic signal at 401 hz",
    "( see figure 1 of wijnands & van der klis 1998b ) which is hardly visible in this broad - band representation , several noise components are visible .",
    "the overall shape is dominated by a strong broad band - limited noise component , which follows a rough power law at high frequencies with a break near 1 hz , below which the spectrum is almost flat . on top of this noise component , at frequencies near 10 hz a bump is present , which may have some sub - structure . at frequencies above 100 hz",
    "a third noise component is present which cuts off around 200300 hz .",
    "this spectral shape is very similar to that seen in other low - luminosity lmxbs ; in fig .",
    "[ comparison]b we show for comparison a power spectrum of 4u 172834 .",
    "we used archival rxte / pca data of march 1 , 1996 of 4u 172834 to calculate this power spectrum ( see also ford & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "we fitted the power spectra with a fit function consisting of a broken power law ( representing the band limited noise ; @xmath5 , with @xmath6 are the power law index below and above the break frequency , respectively ) , a lorentzian ( representing the @xmath010 hz bump ) , and an exponentially cut - off power law ( representing the noise component at higher frequency ; @xmath7 ) . the higher frequency noise component could also be fitted with a broken power law or a broad lorentzian ; this did not affect its measured rms amplitude .",
    "[ powerspectra ] illustrates the changes in the power spectrum of sax j1808.43658 during the course of the outburst ; changes in the break frequency are clearly seen .",
    "the behavior of the fit parameters during the decay of the outburst are plotted together with the 325 kev x - ray flux in fig .",
    "[ parameters ] . both the break frequency and the frequency of the bump decreased ( from 1.60 to 0.25 hz and from 12 to 2.4 hz , respectively ) while the flux dropped ( fig .",
    "[ parameters]c squares and triangles ) . after a 57 day interval during which these frequencies remained at their minimum values , they increased again ( to 1.2 hz and 5.7 hz , respectively ) , while the flux went on decreasing .",
    "after april 26 the flux dropped within less than 3 days by a factor of 20 ( see also gilfanov et al . 1998 ; heindl & smith 1998 ; cui et al .",
    "1998 ) ; at this time , the break frequency decreased again to about 0.6 hz . by this time",
    ", the bump had become undetectable .    the rms amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ parameters]e squares ; 260 kev ; integrated over 0.01 - 100 hz ) of the band - limited noise is anti - correlated with its break frequency .",
    "the rms increased from 20% at the highest break frequencies to about 28% at the lowest break frequencies .",
    "the power law index below the break frequency ( @xmath8 ) increased slightly during the decay ( from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ; fig .",
    "[ parameters]b ) .",
    "the power law index above the break ( @xmath11 ) varied between 1.0 and 1.3 ( fig .",
    "[ parameters]b ) , with no clear correlation with x - ray flux or the break frequency of the band - limited noise .",
    "after 29 april no broad band power was detectable any more .",
    "the 2030% rms amplitude upper limits during these late stages of the outburst are not very stringent and the presence of similar noise components as before can not be excluded .    the rms amplitude of the @xmath010 hz bump gradually dropped from 10% to 4% during the outburst ( 260 kev ; fig .",
    "[ parameters]e triangles ) , without any correlation with its frequency .",
    "after april 23 it is no longer detectable with upper limits of 58 % .",
    "the ratio of the fwhm and the frequency of this bump varied slightly between 0.5 and 1.0 .",
    "the third noise component , between 100 and 400 hz , has an rms amplitude ( 260 kev ; integrated over 101000 hz ) between 13% and 23% ( fig .",
    "[ parameters]f ) . the index @xmath12 of the cut - off power law ( fig .",
    "[ parameters]d ) increases from @xmath01.4 ( thus the noise component is peaked ) on april 11 to @xmath00.5 on april 20 , then decreased again to @xmath01.6 on april 25 . during the last two observations for which this noise component could be detected the index was @xmath00 .",
    "the cut - off frequency and the rms amplitude vary in good correlation to this and all are anti - correlated with the break frequency of the band - limited noise component .",
    "these variations together result in keeping the effective cut - off of this higher frequency noise component approximately constant around 200 hz .",
    "we measured the rms amplitude as a function of the photon energy of the above noise components on three occasions during the decay .",
    "all components tend to increase slightly with photon energy . however , this is not usually very significant .",
    "no khz qpos are detected .",
    "the ( conservative ) upper limits for a qpo with a fwhm of 150 hz between 500 and 1500 hz are between 7% and 8% at the highest observed luminosities ( april 11 and 13 , respectively ) , and 4% or worse ( depending on the source flux and the amount of observing time ) further along the decay of the outburst .",
    "we also searched for khz qpos using only the highest energy channels , but none were found .",
    "the rapid x - ray variability of sax j1808.43658 is dominated by a broad band - limited noise component with a break frequency between 0.25 and 1.6 hz . during the initial decay of the outburst this frequency",
    "was correlated with the mass accretion rate , but at lower luminosities it was anti - correlated . on top of this noise component",
    "a broad bump is detected whose frequency is strongly correlated with the break frequency .",
    "the third component is a broad noise component between 100 and 400 hz , whose properties also correlate to the break frequency . as all characteristic frequencies describing the broad - band noise appear to vary in correlation , it is possible that the three components together describe one complex physical phenomenon rather than three independent processes .",
    "similar band - limited noise components are found in other lmxbs with similar luminosities , such as 4u 172834 ( fig .",
    "[ comparison]b ; ford & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "the high frequency noise component was not previously reported in other lmxbs than 4u 172834 .",
    "we find by re - examination of the data of 4u 0614 + 09 published by mndez et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that it is also present in this source .",
    "also in the power spectra published by ford , van der klis & kaaret ( 1998 ) of 4u 1705 - 44 a similar component can be seen .",
    "it seems that this component is a common feature in the power spectra of neutron star low - luminosity lmxbs at low mass accretion rates , and not unique to the millisecond x - ray pulsar .",
    "so , the rapid x - ray variability below a few hundred hertz between the millisecond x - ray pulsar and low - luminosity neutron star lmxbs is remarkably similar in terms of which components are present .",
    "there may be differences in how these components depend on mass accretion rate . from our detailed description of these dependencies in sax j1808.43658 one possible difference",
    "is already apparent : the break frequency of sax j1808.43658 does not have a strict correlation with the mass accretion rate , whereas in the other sources it has been observed that a strong positive correlation exists ( e.g. yoshida et al .",
    "1993 ; prins & van der klis 1997 ; mndez & van der klis 1997 ; mndez et al .",
    "1997 ; ford & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "however , an analysis as detailed as we performed for sax j1808.43658 has not yet been done for when those sources were at their lowest mass accretion rates .",
    "we can not exclude that there , also the break frequency is anti - correlated with the mass accretion rates at certain ( low ) luminosities .",
    "we detect no khz qpos in sax j1808.43658 , with upper limits well below detected amplitudes in other low - luminosity lmxbs ( e.g. mndez et al . 1997 ) .",
    "however , in those sources below a critical luminosity no khz qpos are detected either ( mndez et al .",
    "1997 ; ford & van der klis 1998 ) . in one case , 4u 0614 + 09 ( mndez et al .",
    "1997 ) , this critical luminosity may be below the peak outburst luminosity we observe for sax j1808.43658 , however , due to uncertainties in the distance determinations no conclusive statements can be made .",
    "also these critical luminosities appear to be higher in other sources ( e.g. ford et al .",
    "1997 ; ford & van der klis 1998 ; smale , zhang , & white 1997 ) .",
    "however , it is remarkable that when no khz qpos were detected in 4u 0614 + 09 the break frequency of the band - limited noise was 0.7 hz ( mndez et al .",
    "1997 ) , in the range of the break frequencies observed in sax j1808.43658 .",
    "however , when khz qpos were detected in 4u 0614 + 09 the break frequency was above 6.6 hz ( mndez et al .",
    "1997 ) , which is above our maximum observed break frequency .",
    "the same is true for 4u 1705 - 44 ( ford et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it seems that the break frequency can be used to predict whether khz qpos are observable or not .",
    "if true , we expect khz qpos to be observable in sax j1808.43658 when the break frequency is slightly higher ( above @xmath07 hz ) , thus , when the mass accretion increases to higher values than we observed during the 1998 outburst .",
    "such higher mass accretion rates are possible in view of the higher asm count rates observed during the 1996 outburst of sax j1808.43658 .",
    "we conclude that , although there may be some differences in the details of how the power spectrum depends on the mass accretion rate , at this stage there is no evidence for any intrinsic difference in the rapid aperiodic x - ray variability between sax j1808.43658 and other lmxbs .",
    "so if for example the magnetic field would be considerably lower in the non - pulsating neutron star lmxbs compared to that of the millisecond x - ray pulsar , or would be oriented differently , then this difference in magnetic field does not affect the aperiodic timing behavior .",
    "the conclusion would have to be that the aperiodic x - ray variability is produced in the accretion disk , and has little interaction with what happens inside the magnetosphere or even the magnetopause .",
    "if , on the other hand , it is a lower inclination that allows sax j1808.43658 to pulse where other lmxbs do not , then the fact that this does not significantly alter the rapid aperiodic x - ray variability implies a roughly spherically symmetric emission pattern for these variations , whereas the pulsations would be strongly beamed along the polar axis .",
    "this once again suggests an origin for the rapid aperiodic variability away from the center , where the pulses originate , and most likely in the accretion disk outside the magnetosphere .",
    "this work was supported in part by the netherlands foundation for research in astronomy ( astron ) grant 781 - 76 - 017 .",
    "rw and mvk acknowledge stimulating conversations about the broad - band limited noise components in lmxbs with eric ford , jeroen homan , and peter jonker ."
