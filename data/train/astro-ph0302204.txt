    "the detection of extrasolar planets and planetary systems ( e.g. , mayor & queloz 1995 ) has invigorated studies of planetary formation ( lissauer 1993 ; boss 1998 , 2000 ) , migration ( e.g. , lin & papaloizou 1986 ; lin et al .",
    "1996 ; trilling et al . 1998 ; r. nelson et al .",
    "2000 ) , and interaction with a protoplanetary disc ( lin & papalizou 1979a , b ; artymowicz & lubow 1994 ) .",
    "recent theoretical work has investigated mechanisms for halting planetary migration and explaining the statistical distribution of the orbital radii of extrasolar planets ( armitage et al . 2002 ; kuchner & lecar 2002 ; trilling , lunine & benz 2002 ) .",
    "theoretical models for the interactions of ( proto)planets with a protoplanetary disc show that large low density regions ( gaps ) can be created within the disc ( lin & papaloizou 1979a , b ; artymowicz & lubow 1994 ) .",
    "the detection of these gaps would provide strong support for planetary formation theories , but current observations do not have the spatial resolution to directly image the au sized gaps that are predicted .",
    "future instrumentation , such as alma , may allow direct detection of gaps ( wolf , henning & kley 2002 ) , but for now we are restricted to spectral techniques for inferring the presence of disc gaps .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from protoplanetary discs arise from the thermal reprocessing of starlight and dissipation of viscous accretion luminosity ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ; adams , lada & shu 1987 ; kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) . the resulting seds display characteristic infrared excesses that are sensitive to the size , shape , and mass of the disc .",
    "disc gaps may manifest themselves in seds by removing material that would normally have contributed to the sed at a given wavelength : gaps close to the star result in smaller than usual near - ir excesses , while gaps at large disc radii will cause distortions to the sed at longer wavelengths ( beckwith 1999 ) .",
    "the classical t  tauri stars gm  aur and tw  hya have seds that indicate the inner regions of their discs have been cleared of material out to around 4  au from the central stars ( koerner , sargent , & beckwith 1993 ; chiang & goldreich 1999 ; schneider et al .",
    "2002 ; calvet et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "there are a number of possible mechanisms for clearling such gaps .",
    "photoevaporation by ultraviolet radiation , either from the central star or from surrounding radiation , can produce a disc wind at radii where the sound speed exceeds the escape velocity ( clarke et al .",
    "the inner regions of the disc will then be cleared on a viscous timescale once the wind mass loss rate is comparable to the accretion rate .",
    "this , however , generally requires an accretion rate two orders of magnitude lower than the @xmath4 accretion rate expected for gm  aur ( gullbring et al .",
    "clarke et al . ( 2001 ) also assumed a constant ionizing flux .",
    "matsuyama et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show that the clearing of the inner disc is even less likely if the decrease in ionizing flux with decreasing accretion rate is included in the calculation .",
    "a. nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also suggest that viscous dissipation and the dissipation of gravitational instabilities may increase the midplane temperature of the inner regions of the disc to above the grain destruction temperature .",
    "this would then manifest itself as a reduction in the flux of radiation with wavelengths between a few and ten microns .",
    "their simulation , however , assumed a disc luminosity ( @xmath5 ) an order of magnitude greater than that calculated by gullbring et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for gm  aur ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "it has been suggested ( calvet et al .",
    "2002 ) that the inner regions of tw hydra s disc could be cleared by tidal interactions with an embedded planet ( lin & papalizou 1979a , b ) . in this paper",
    "we consider if the gap in gm  aur s disc could be formed in the same way .",
    "we use a dynamical model of an approximately jupiter mass planet in a protoplanetary accretion disc , with parameters appropriate for gm  aur ( e.g. , koerner , sargent & beckwith 1993 ; simon , dutrey & guilloteau 2000 ; schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) , to investigate if the resulting disc structure can reproduce the observed sed .",
    "we also consider other planet masses to test if the sed can be used to constrain the planet mass .",
    "estimates for gm  aur s age vary from @xmath7 myr ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; siess , forestini & bertout 1999 ) to @xmath8 myr ( simon & prato 1995 ; hartmann 2002 )",
    ". there has therefore been sufficient time for an embedded planet to have formed via core accretion ( lissauer 1993 ) or via gravitational collapse ( boss 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "the observation of a much younger system ( e.g. , @xmath9 myr ) with an sed signature indicating the presence of a disc gap would , if the gap could be shown to be due to the presence of an embedded planet , suggest that either core accretion occurs on a much shorter timescale than expected or that planet formation can occur via an alternative mechanism such as gravitational collapse . in section  2",
    "we describe and present the results of our dynamical simulations , in   3 we compare model seds with the observed sed of gm  aur , and we summarize our results in   4 .",
    "the simulations presented here were performed using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , a lagrangian hydrodynamics code ( e.g. , benz 1990 ; monaghan 1992 ) .",
    "we initially assume a planet with mass @xmath10 orbits a star , with mass @xmath11 , at a radius of @xmath12 au .",
    "both the central star and planet are modelled as point masses onto which gas particles can accrete if they approach to within the sink radius ( bate et al .",
    "the planet orbits within a circumstellar disc of mass @xmath13 , modelled using 300000 sph gas particles distributed such as to give a surface density profile of @xmath14 ( dalessio et al .",
    "the disc extends from @xmath15 au to @xmath16 au .",
    "the disc temperature varies as @xmath17 , as expected for discs heated by starlight ( dalessio et al .",
    "1998 ) , and we assume hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction , giving a central density profile of @xmath18 . for the sph simulation , the disc is assumed to be locally isothermal and the above temperature profile is maintained throughout the simulation .",
    "the parameters chosen are appropriate for gm  aur based on calculations of the stellar mass ( simon , dutrey & guilloteau 2000 ) and the disc mass and size ( schneider et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the vertical scale height , @xmath19 , of the disc is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the local sound speed , @xmath22 is the radius , @xmath23 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath24 is the stellar mass .",
    "the temperature is normalised such as to give a scale height of 10.5 au at 100 au",
    ". the scale height at 2.5 au is then 0.1 au , giving an @xmath25 value of 0.04 .",
    "this choice of scale height was based on an sed model using an analytic disc geometry and is similar to that obtained by schneider et al.(2002 ) . in using the above form for the scale height , we assume that the dust has the same scale height as the gas .",
    "although this may not necessarily be the case , the need to use a dust scale height that has the same form as a standard equilibrium disc ( e.g. , pringle 1981 ) would seem to make this a reasonable assumption .    using 300000 sph particles the vertical profile of the disk",
    "can be modelled accurately within @xmath26 scale heights of the disc midplane . for higher altitudes , the density is calculated analytically using ( e.g. , pringle 1981 )    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the height above the disc midplane , and @xmath29 is the central density a distance @xmath22 from the central star , determined using the dynamical model .",
    "very little mass is contained in these regions of the disc and is hence unimportant for the dynamical calculation .",
    "it is , however , extremely important for calculating the radiative transfer through the disc ( see dalessio et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "self - gravity is included in the calculation and both the point masses and the gas use a tree to calculate gravitational forces ( benz et al .",
    "the inclusion of self - gravity means that the central star and planet are both free to move under the gravitational influence of the disc .",
    "a great saving in computational time is obtained by using individual , particle time - steps ( bate et al .",
    "1995 ; navarro & white 1993 ) which are limited by the courant condition and a force condition ( benz et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "a planet orbiting within a circumstellar disc will tidally interact with the disc .",
    "disc material exterior to the planet will gain angular momentum from the planet and will move to larger radii , while material interior to the planet will lose angular momentum and move to smaller radii ( lin & papaloizou 1979a , b ; artymowicz & lubow 1994 ) . viscous processes within the disc will tend to act against the tidal forces and the formation of a gap will depend on the tidal forces overcoming these viscous processes ( lin & papaloizou 1979a ) .",
    "this depends on the relative magnitudes of the mass ratio of the planet and the star , @xmath30 , and the reynolds number within the disc , @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 a gap will form , while if @xmath33 the disc will be truncated at the outer lindblad resonance .",
    "the reynolds number is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angular frequency , @xmath22 is the radius , and @xmath36 is the turbulent viscosity in the disc generally described as an alpha viscosity ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .    for the initial simulation ( @xmath10 , @xmath13 ) considered here @xmath37 , and",
    "the reynolds number , determined from the artificial viscosity included in the code ( murray 1996 ) , is @xmath38 . therefore @xmath32 but @xmath39 .",
    "a gap should form with the gap edge at the outer lindblad resonance located , for a planet orbiting at @xmath40 au , at a radius @xmath41 au . however , for the mass ratio and reynolds number in this initial simulation , the disc should not be strongly truncated at the outer lindblad resonance .",
    "the lindblad resonance can be determined from @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the angluar frequency of the orbiting planet and , for the outer lindblad resonance , @xmath44 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; lin & paploizou 1979a ) .",
    "the angular frequency at the outer lindblad resonance is therefore @xmath45 .",
    "the assumption of a planet orbiting at @xmath40 au was based on sed calculations using an analytic disc geometry and the results of schneider et al.(2002 ) which suggest that the best fit to the sed occurs for gap extending to a radius of @xmath46 au ( i.e. , the radius of the outer lindblad resonance for a planet orbiting at @xmath47 au ) .",
    "figure [ centdens ] shows the azimuthally averaged midplane density at the beginning ( dashed line ) and end ( solid line ) of the simulation .",
    "after @xmath48 years the planet orbiting at @xmath40 au has produced a gap in the disc out to @xmath49 au .",
    "the gap edge is relatively soft , consistent with the relative magnitudes of the mass ratio ( @xmath30 ) and reynolds number ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the softness of the gap edge is likely to have an impact on the radiation transfer through the disc .",
    "as will be considered in a later section , to produce a gap with a significantly harder edge would require a more massive companion or a significantly less viscous disc .",
    "the mass within @xmath50 au has reduced from @xmath51 at @xmath52 to @xmath53 at @xmath54 years .",
    "the reduction in the number of sph particles respresenting the gas within @xmath50 au requires the use of equation [ zdens ] to determine the vertical density at distances greater than @xmath55 scale height above the disc midplane .",
    "if the planet clears sufficient material from within its orbit , torques from material outside its orbit should cause it to eventually lose angular momentum and spiral inwards .",
    "however , the planet in this simulation is approximately four times as massive as the disc material contained within its orbit and hence we expect it to suffer minimal orbital migration ( syer & clarke 1995 ; r. nelson et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "accretion onto the central star and the orbiting planet continues throughout the simulation despite the formation of the gap , consistent with simulations performed by artymowicz & lubow ( 1996 ) .",
    "the central star has increased from it s initial mass of @xmath56 to a mass of @xmath57 after @xmath48 years , while the orbiting planet has increased from @xmath58 to @xmath59 in the same time period .",
    "the accretion rate at the end of the simulation ( averaged over the last 100 years ) was @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the central star and orbiting planet respectively .",
    "an accurate calculation of the accretion rate in our simulation is limited by the mass resolution , since each sph particle has a mass of @xmath62 , and by our simplistic accretion process .",
    "we do not include the rotating magnetosphere of the t tauri star which is likely to truncate the disc at the corotation radius and force the accretion flow to follow the stellar magnetic field lines ( ghosh & lamb 1978 ) .",
    "the accretion rate from the model is however similar to that expected for gm  aur ( gullbring et al .",
    "1998 ) . that mass is flowing through the gap and accreting onto the central star and planet",
    "is also consistent with other simulations ( artymowicz & lubow 1996 ; lubow et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the disc velocities also remain very close to keplerian despite the presence of an orbiting planet that perturbs the potential .",
    "this is consistent with co observations ( koerner , sargent & beckwith 1993 ; dutrey et al .",
    "1998 ) which suggest that gm  aur is surrounded by a keplerian circumstellar disc inclined at @xmath63 .",
    "we calculate the sed for our simulations using the monte carlo radiative equilibrium technique of bjorkman & wood ( 2001 ) .",
    "the output of our radiative transfer simulation is the disc temperature structure and the emergent sed .",
    "the disc heating is assumed to be from starlight and the monte carlo `` photons '' are tracked within a two dimensional grid in @xmath22 and @xmath64 .",
    "our radiation transfer code calculates disc temperature and does not assume a vertically isothermal structure as in the sph simulation .",
    "the input stellar spectrum is a 4000k , @xmath65 kurucz model atmosphere ( kurucz 1994 ) and the stellar radius ( @xmath66 ) is taken to be 1.75 @xmath67 .",
    "the circumstellar dust opacity is taken to be that described in wood et al .",
    "( 2002a ) which fits the hh  30  irs sed and was also used to fit the gm  aur sed ( schneider et al .",
    "the dust model has a shallower wavelength dependent opacity than `` standard '' ism dust ( e.g. , mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ) and a larger grain size as inferred for many other classical t  tauri stars ( e.g. , beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; beckwith & sargent 1991 ) .",
    "we find that the dearth of near - ir excess in gm  aur s sed can not be explained by a dust composition different to that used here . using an ism mixture and a disc without a substantial gap still results in a near - ir excess not observed in gm  aur .",
    "our results are also in agreement with the calvet et al .",
    "( 2002 ) modelling of tw  hya . in their model",
    "they do use different dust types in the inner and outer disc , but still require a very low density inner disc to reproduce the near - ir emission observed in tw  hya .",
    "further , ism grains yield too steep a slope to the sub - mm sed ( see also beckwith & sargent 1991 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the dearth of near - ir excess emission from gm  aur can only be explained by an evacuated ( low density ) inner region .",
    "circumstellar discs absorb and reprocess stellar photons in a layer which , depending on the disc optical depth , can lie four to five scaleheights above the disc midplane ( dalessio et al .",
    "our sph simulations can not resolve this low density material , so to provide a density grid for our radiation transfer simulations we have extrapolated the density , using equation ( [ zdens ] ) , to large heights above the disk midplane .",
    "the density calculated from the sph simulations was azimuthally averaged and then interpolated onto a two dimensional grid in @xmath22 and @xmath64 .",
    "the grid has 100 cells for @xmath68 spaced proportional to @xmath69 and 400 cells linearly spaced for @xmath70 .",
    "this gridding allows us to adequately resolve the sph density for our sed calculations .",
    "figure [ sed_2j ] shows the gm  aur sed data .",
    "the dotted line shows the input model atmosphere , and the open squares are data points obtained using various instruments ( e.g. , cohen & kuhi 1979 ; kenyon & hartmann 1995 ; weaver & jones 1992 ; beckwith & sargent 1991 ) . the solid line shows the sed calculated using the azimuthally averaged sph density as input to the monte carlo radiation transfer calculation .",
    "the sph simulation was run for @xmath71 orbits of the @xmath72 jupiter mass planet at @xmath40 au ( 1820 years ) , giving sufficient time for the density profile to reach a steady state .",
    "the disc structure is also approximately azimuthally symmetric since the viscous timescale is significantly greater than the planet s orbital period .",
    "the inclination of the disc was taken to be @xmath73 , consistent with the value of @xmath74 determined by dutrey et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and with the recent scattered light models of schneider et al .",
    "the model sed provides a good fit to the observations , particularly the lack of near - ir excess and the level and slope of the long wavelength continuum .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ sed_2j ] is the sed for an equivalent disc in which a gap is not present and in which the inner edge of the disc is taken to be at @xmath75 stellar radii .",
    "comparison between the solid line and dashed line clearly shows that the effect of the disc clearing is to reduce the excess emission at short wavelengths ( @xmath76 microns ) and slightly increase the excess at longer wavelengths ( @xmath77 microns ) .",
    "this is consequence of the stellar flux being reprocessed at the disc edge . in the simulation with @xmath78 (",
    "dashed line in figure [ sed_2j ] ) stellar photons are reprocessed in high temperature ( @xmath79 k ) regions of the disc giving a near - ir excess . when a gap is present the photons are reprocessed further out in the disc where the temperature is lower , decreasing the near infrared flux and increasing the flux at longer wavelengths .",
    "a fit to the data is only possible if the gap extends all the way to the inner disc boundary .",
    "if the planet has only had sufficient time to clear a ring of material , leaving the inner disc almost unchanged , this inner material should remain hot , resulting in @xmath80 and @xmath2 micron fluxes similar to that for the dashed line in figure [ sed_2j ] , and higher than that observed for gm  aur ( open squares ) .",
    "although we are able to reproduce the observed sed with a @xmath72 jupiter mass planet orbiting at @xmath40 au , the exact form of the density profile depends on the relationship between the mass ratio , @xmath30 , and the disc reynolds number , @xmath81 .",
    "a weakness of sph is the difficulty in determining exactly the viscosity and hence reynolds number . in light of this , we have performed a number of additional simulations considering substellar companions ( planets ) of various masses , each of which was run for at least @xmath82 orbits of the companion around the central star ( @xmath79 years ) . in these simulations",
    "the disc was modelled between @xmath83 and @xmath84 au using @xmath85 sph particles with a surface density profile such that the total disc mass would be @xmath86 were the disc extended to @xmath87 au . using @xmath85 sph particles to simulate the inner @xmath84 au of the disc should give approximately the same resolution as the @xmath88 particles used to simulate the disc out to @xmath87 au .",
    "the reynolds number in the simulations using @xmath85 sph particles should therefore be very similar to the reynolds number in a @xmath88 particle simulation ( murray 1996 ) .",
    "the companion masses considered for these additional simulations were @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . in simulating companions with relatively large masses ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) we are not necessarily suggesting that one would expect to observe substellar companions with such masses , but simply illustrating how the sed can vary with mass . strictly speaking , such massive objects",
    "would generally be regarded as brown dwarfs , and we therefore refer to the @xmath90 and @xmath91 companions as substellar objects rather than planets .    the process of star formation is known to preferentially produce binary stellar systems rather than single stars ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) . on the main sequence , however , the mass ratio of close binaries is rarely so extreme as to pair a solar mass star with a brown dwarf ( marcy & butler 2000 ; halbwachs et al .",
    "if this trend also exists during the pre - main - sequence phase , one would expect disc - embedded planetary mass objects to be more common than embedded close brown dwarfs .",
    "the formation mechanism of close binaries is , however , unclear with some simulations ( bate , bonnell & bromm 2002 ) suggesting substantial evolution of binary orbital parameters while a disc is present .",
    "the possibility of observing substellar mass companions at this early stage could therefore be an important test of different binary formation models .",
    "the reynolds number , @xmath81 , in the disc is calculated to be @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath89 and @xmath72 jupiter mass planets therefore have @xmath92 but @xmath93 while the @xmath90 and @xmath94 jupiter mass substellar objects have @xmath92 and @xmath95",
    ". the two planets ( @xmath89 and @xmath96 ) should therefore produce gaps that are not strongly truncated at the outer lindblad resonance while the two substellar objects ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) should truncate the disc strongly at the outer lindblad resonance ( lin & papaloizou 1979a ; syer & clarke 1995 ) . for a reynolds number larger than used here ,",
    "a planetary mass companion ( @xmath97 ) would satisfy easily the latter condition ( @xmath92 and @xmath95 ) .",

    "a few jupiter mass planet orbiting at 2.5 au will produce a ` wobble ' in the central star , at the distance of gm  aur ( @xmath107 pc ) , with an angular displacement of @xmath108 milliarcsec , and a period of @xmath46 years .",
    "future high precision astrometric instruments should be sufficiently sensitive to make such observations . not only",
    "would this establish if a planet is indeed orbiting at @xmath106 au but should also allow for the determination of the planet mass from which the reynolds number , and hence the turbulent viscosity , could be estimated .",
    "the transfer of angular momentum between the embedded planet and the disc material is ultimately expected to cause the planet to migrate inwards ( lin & paploizou 1986 ) .",
    "simulations ( r. nelson et al 2000 ) suggest that the migration timescale is of order @xmath110 yrs for a jupiter mass planet starting at 5 au . since as many as 15 percent of solar type stars are expected to have planets within @xmath50 au , that there are only currently two t tauri stars with sed signatures of close - in massive planets is somewhat surprising .",
    "this could reflect the relatively sparse observations in the relevant wavelength range ( @xmath111 microns ) .",
    "alternatively , fully evacuated inner holes may form in only a fraction of classical t tauri stars with planets .",
    "an annular gap with a sizeable inner disc would lead to less obvious signatures in the sed .",

    "<S> the unusual spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the classical t tauri star gm aurigae provides evidence for the presence of an inner disc hole extending to several au . using a combination of hydrodynamical simulations and monte carlo radiative transport , we investigate whether the observed sed is consistent with the inner hole being created and maintained by an orbiting planet . we show that an @xmath0 planet , orbiting at 2.5  au in a disc with mass @xmath1 and radius 300  au , provides a good match both to the sed and to co observations which constrain the velocity field in the disc . </S>",
