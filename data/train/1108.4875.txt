    "since the discovery of high-@xmath6 superconductivity in la@xmath4ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3  @xcite , the analysis of many experiments has led to a complex phase diagram of cuprate materials , in part originating from the competition between antiferromagnetic ( af ) and superconducting ( sc ) correlations .",
    "both are induced by the coulomb repulsion on the copper @xmath7-orbitals in the cuo@xmath8 planes . at a critical hole - doping level antiferromagnetism and superconductivity",
    "are in balance , and details of the material or its environment determine which order is realized or whether a regime of coexistence or local phase separation exists . at very low temperatures",
    "most cuprates show a transition from an af to a sc state , if the density of charge carriers exceeds a critical value , and superconductivity vanishes again beyond a higher carrier density , when the coulomb interaction becomes less significant .    above the critical hole doping level ,",
    "af correlations on reduced time and length scales persist and fluctuating antiferromagnetism may coexist with cooper pairing .",
    "one prominent phase with a combination of both has stripe order .",
    "an ordered phase with static stripes was first observed in 1994 by tranquada _",
    "et al_. in the nickelate la@xmath8nio@xmath9",
    "@xcite and later on in the rare - earth doped cuprate la@xmath0nd@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3  @xcite and in the original high-@xmath6 cuprate la@xmath4ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the cuprate systems evolve from a mott insulator into a homogeneous sc phase as @xmath10 is increased , but as @xmath10 approaches @xmath11 , antiferromagnetism returns in a characteristic spin - density - wave ( sdw ) pattern and superconductivity is suppressed  @xcite . based on his neutron scattering data ,",
    "tranquada suggested the existence of antiferromagnetically ordered spin ladders separated by metallic lines , thus forming stripes with a width of four lattice constants ( figure  [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "the metallic lines form anti - phase domain - wall boundaries between the af stripes , which optimizes the kinetic energy through virtual electronic hopping processes into the af stripes  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of static stripe order seems to be tied to the structural transition into the anisotropic low - temperature tetragonal phase ( ltt ) in which at low temperatures superconductivity possibly coexists with stripe order  @xcite .",
    "the spin dynamics of such systems , has been explained quite successfully using models of coupled spin ladders  @xcite , although their microscopic origin has remained unresolved within this ansatz , and superconductivity was not incorporated . in this framework both , site and bond centered (",
    "i.e. three- or two - legged ) ladders are compatible with the experimental results for the dynamical spin susceptibility , although distinct theoretical considerations suggest that site centered stripes are favored  @xcite .",
    "unidirectional charge- and spin - stripe order was indeed predicted for cuprate systems before their experimental discovery . in 1989 ,",
    "zaanen and gunnarson  @xcite and machida  @xcite found af stripe formation in the mean - field solution of a two - band hubbard model .",
    "after stripes had been discovered experimentally , the @xmath12@xmath13 model was identified as a more appropriate approach towards stripe formation in hole doped cuprates .",
    "extensive numerical studies were performed using exact diagonalization  @xcite , dmrg methods  @xcite or monte carlo simulations  @xcite , all indicating that stripes indeed form in the hole doped @xmath12@xmath13 model .",
    "although these numerically exact results yielded a consistent picture , their range of validity is limited by small system sizes and boundary effects , and the inclusion of superconductivity has only recently become possible  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , new approaches have been developed for a phenomenological characterization of the sc state that possibly coexists with spin- and charge - stripe order .",
    "et al_. suggested a new type of sc state , termed pair density wave  ( pdw ) , in which cooper pairs with center - of - mass momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 coexist and the pair density oscillates with wave vector @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the latter oscillation is analogous to the fflo solution of a superconductor in magnetic fields presented by fulde and ferrell  @xcite and by larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite , and is typically accompanied by a cdw with wave vector @xmath16 .",
    "houzet and buzdin introduced a description of the fflo state on the ginzburg - landau level  @xcite , which was later used as a model for the pdw by agterberg and tsunetsugu  @xcite and by berg _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the pdw state without antiferromagnetism was shown to be the energetically stable solution for a microscopic nearest - neighbor pairing model with sufficiently strong pairing interaction  @xcite .",
    "this state indeed explains qualitatively some of the observed properties of striped cuprates  @xcite .    to examine the nature of the sc state in coexistence with spin- and charge - stripe order ,",
    "a simple microscopic model is desirable which allows to adequately describe magnetic and sc order simultaneously , merging the strong - coupling ansatz of the @xmath12@xmath13 model with the weak - coupling framework of bcs theory .",
    "work in this direction was recently performed using a gutzwiller renormalized mean - field ansatz for the @xmath12@xmath13 model  @xcite .",
    "however , the pdw did not prove to be the groundstate , but rather a modulated @xmath7-wave  state without phase shift of the sc order parameter between neighboring stripes was found as the lowest energy solution .",
    "in contrast to the pdw , this modulated @xmath7-wave  has a pair density that oscillates around a finite uniform @xmath17 component , and pair and charge densities oscillate with the same wave vector .",
    "[ width=0.74]fig1.pdf    in this paper we introduce a modified @xmath12@xmath18 model as an extension of the standard @xmath12@xmath13 model which allows for a straightforward mean - field decoupling .",
    "this method of relaxing the no - double - occupancy constraint and extending the @xmath12@xmath13 model by an additional on - site repulsion was originally introduced by kagan and rice  @xcite to demonstrate the possibility of @xmath7-wave superconductivity in the @xmath12@xmath13 model .",
    "this ansatz enables us to study stripe formation and superconductivity in a wide range of parameters , and it merges two previously distinct approaches to theoretically describe cuprates in different regimes of the renormalized exchange coupling @xmath18 .    in section  [ sec : tj - bcs ] we introduce the @xmath12@xmath18 model and identify two parameter regimes where a mean - field description of magnetic correlations is appropriate for hole - doped systems : @xmath19  @xmath20 . in this limit superconductivity dominates and antiferromagnetism is controlled by the on - site coulomb repulsion rather than by the superexchange interaction . for small @xmath21 the @xmath12@xmath21 model therefore maps onto a simple nearest - neighbor pairing hamiltonian with an additional on - site repulsion @xmath22 ; this model is derived in section  [ sec : bcs ] as the @xmath22-model .",
    "@xmath23  @xmath24 . a strong exchange interaction tends to phase separate the system into a hole - free antiferromagnet and a hole - rich part  @xcite .",
    "we show that for @xmath25 an intermediate regime exists in which the charge is separated periodically in half - filled af regions and quarter - filled metallic regions . in this regime",
    "the coulomb repulsion is less significant and the @xmath12@xmath21 model approaches the so called @xmath26-model , which was investigated in detail in  @xcite in particular with respect to the breakdown of superconductivity in la@xmath0nd@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 near @xmath5 .",
    "a similar regime has also been found in the @xmath12@xmath13 model itself using dmrg calculations  @xcite and variational monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : bdg ] describes the numerical strategy to obtain striped solutions within the framework of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "although charge- and spin - stripe order coexisting with superconductivity is found for @xmath20 as well as for @xmath24 , there are important qualitative differences in the two regimes .",
    "we provide a detailed comparison for the origin of stripe formation in both regimes in section  [ sec : u - v ] .",
    "the striped groundstate solution presented in this section is energetically favored among a considerable number of other possible solutions .",
    "many of these energetically unfavorable solutions exist only in certain temperature ranges .",
    "we therefore present a survey of the temperature dependences of the most regular solutions in section  [ sec : t ] . in section  [ sec : conc ] we draw conclusions and discuss our findings in relation to striped cuprate materials .",
    "shortly after the discovery of high-@xmath6-cuprates it was agreed upon that the electronic structure of the cuo@xmath8 planes is well described by a three - band hubbard ( emery ) model  @xcite , which can be further reduced to a one - band repulsive hubbard model for electron densities above @xmath29  @xcite . apart from numerically exact solutions , two different approaches have commonly been followed to treat the hubbard interaction @xmath30 : @xmath19  in the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath31 ) , the hubbard model is approximated by the @xmath12@xmath13 model with a finite superexchange coupling @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this effective interaction is non - local and responsible for superconductivity as well as for antiferromagnetism .",
    "@xmath23  alternatively , effective non - local interactions in the finite @xmath22 hubbard model can be computed numerically using , for example , qmc simulations  @xcite or determined diagrammatically , e.g. in the rpa approximation .",
    "one thereby obtains a non - local attractive interaction between electrons on nearest - neighbor sites which may serve as a basis for a bcs type mean - field description .    in this section ,",
    "we derive mean - field hamiltonians for both of the above approaches , @xmath19 and @xmath23 , and show that they indeed describe the same physics and are formally equivalent .",
    "we start from the @xmath12@xmath13 hamiltonian : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the projected annihilation operator which enforces the constraint that no lattice site is doubly occupied .",
    "the spin operator is @xmath37 with @xmath38 containing the pauli matrices .",
    "here we use the matrix elements @xmath39 for nearest and next - nearest neighbor hopping with @xmath40 , and @xmath41 denotes all pairs of nearest - neighbor sites @xmath42 and @xmath43 . note that the three - site terms are omitted in the hamiltonian  ( [ tj1 ] ) .",
    "the constraint on the site occupation is the main obstacle in solving the @xmath12@xmath13 model and also prevents a straightforward mean - field approximation .",
    "an ansatz to solve this problem is the slave - boson technique ( see  @xcite for a review ) . here",
    "we follow alternatively a method by kagan and rice  @xcite who introduced an extension of @xmath44 , in which an additional hubbard repulsion @xmath45 replaces the local constraints : @xmath46 in the limit @xmath47 , one recovers @xmath48 from  ( [ tj2 ] ) with @xmath49 , if the three - sites terms are omitted . generally , mean - field solutions of @xmath50 overestimate antiferromagnetism as compared to superconductivity at large interaction strength .",

    "furthermore , @xmath60 contains two terms which favor antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the hubbard term @xmath62 costs the energy @xmath45 for each doubly occupied lattice site and thus polarizes the spin on each site . the kinetic energy in turn is optimized by ordering the spins antiferromagnetically .",
    "the term @xmath63 directly supports an opposite spin alignment on nearest - neighbor sites by the energy @xmath64 per bond , where @xmath65 is the local magnetic moment . for large values of @xmath18",
    "the system approaches perfect af order and the hubbard term looses relevance . on the other hand ,",
    "even if all lattice sites are fully spin polarized by a large @xmath45 , a finite @xmath18 term in  ( [ tj4 ] ) leads to af correlations .",
    "the above reasoning justifies to use @xmath66 with a finite @xmath45 instead of the original @xmath12@xmath13 hamiltonian for the following physical reason : in the limit @xmath67 , the half - filled one - band hubbard model decouples into independent localized electrons without any magnetic order . in the @xmath12@xmath13 model , this is reflected by @xmath68 .",

    "therefore we neglect the triplet component in the following calculations and discussions and use the spin - singlet order parameter @xmath85 alone with the coupling constant @xmath26 [ instead of @xmath18 as in  ( [ tj5 ] ) ] .",
    "furthermore , @xmath79 has an additional prefactor @xmath86 in the sc term .",
    "therefore sc order is weighted stronger in @xmath60 than in @xmath79 and consequently @xmath18 has to be larger than @xmath26 in order to stabilize antiferromagnetism ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : u ] ) .",
    "notice that the last term @xmath87 in  ( [ tj8 ] ) , which appears identically also in @xmath60 , is absent in the classical bcs theory , because in a homogeneous system it only renormalizes the chemical potential @xmath88 used to control the particle number ( see section  [ sec : bdg ] ) .",

    ". therefore the failure of the mean - field theory to describe the quasiparticle peak at the fermi energy of a doped mott insulator is not relevant .",
