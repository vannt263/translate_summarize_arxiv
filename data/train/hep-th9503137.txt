    "it is well known that the mathematical structure of four dimensional ( 4d ) , realistic field theories is much more involved than the world of 2d models .",
    "therefore there is a long history of attempts to study physical problems in low dimensional theories .",
    "many concepts have first been developed in 2d toy models before they were taken over to 4d physics .",
    "maybe the most prominent example is u(1)-gauge theory in two dimensions first analyzed by schwinger @xcite and therefore christened _",
    "schwinger model_. a very attractive feature of the model is its rather simple solution as long as there is no mass term taken into account .",
    "the construction of the massive model @xcite , @xcite is a little bit more subtle .",
    "also the introduction of several flavors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite makes the model less straightforward than the original version .",
    "nevertheless it is rather surprising that the case of more than one flavor has not been analyzed systematically yet .",
    "it is the intent of this thesis to fill this gap and to push forward the construction of qed in two dimensions with mass and flavor ( @xmath0 ) as far as possible .",
    "of course this project is inspired by some ` 4d mysteries ' , as should be any investigation of toy models .",
    "namely the topics that will be attacked are the construction of the @xmath1-vacuum in qcd , the u(1)-problem and witten - veneziano type formulas .",
    "those problems are closely related to each other .    the @xmath1-vacuum @xcite ,",
    "@xcite is supposed to be the superposition of topological sectors in order to obtain the gauge invariant , physical vacuum . as will be discussed below",
    ", the mathematical status of this construction is rather vague .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath1-vacuum is a generally accepted concept . in particular",
    "it was used to propose a solution of the u(1)-problem @xcite , @xcite .    due to the breaking of the axial u(1)-symmetry one could a priori expect a corresponding goldstone boson .",
    "the lack of experimental evidence for this particle is refered to as the u(1)-problem @xcite . at first glance",
    "this problem does not seem to be there at all , since the u(1 ) axial current acquires the adler - bardeen anomaly when quantizing the theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "using the fact that the anomaly can be rewritten as a total divergence @xcite , the current can be redefined in such a way that it is conserved . ignoring the missing gauge invariance of the newly defined current",
    ", one now can indeed expect a goldstone particle . from a less reckless point of view it has to be doubted",
    "if the u(1)-problem is really well posed , since gauge invariance is one of the corner - stones of qcd , and the gauge variant conserved current does not act in the physical subspace .",
    "finally witten - veneziano type formulas @xcite , @xcite , @xcite are another link between the topologically nontrivial structure of the qcd vacuum and the u(1)-problem .",
    "they relate the masses of pseudoscalar mesons ( the would be goldstone bosons ) to the topological susceptibility .",
    "unfortunately the status of those formulas is not completely clear , or they are only formulated for massless qcd .",
    "the three quoted problems can all be addressed rather well in @xmath0 .",
    "u(1)-gauge theory in two dimensions has a nontrivial topological structure and the formal construction of the @xmath1-vacuum can be performed .",
    "the axial - vector current has an anomaly , and the schwinger model shows mass generation .",
    "thus the situation concerning the u(1)-problem is equivalent to qcd . finally witten - veneziano formulas should be obeyed as well .    of course it would not make sense to repeat the argumentation from qcd . here",
    "the strategy will be to construct the model independent of poorly defined concepts like @xmath1-vacua , and to draw the lessons for qcd afterwards .",
    "on the way also a new and careful construction of @xmath1-vacua will be given .",
    "before i start to explore what has been outlined in the prologue , a short overview will be given .    to be more explicit about what",
    "should be learned for qcd , the announced 4d topics will be discussed in chapter 2 .",
    "i will review the construction of the @xmath1-vacuum , the u(1)-problem and witten - veneziano type formulas .",
    "in particular it will be pointed out where criticism is advisable .",
    "the formulation that will be used to construct @xmath0 is the framework of euclidean path integrals .",
    "section 3.1 is dedicated to the discussion of the euclidean action that describes the model under consideration .",
    "besides the gauge field it will be necessary to introduce another vector field @xmath4 .",
    "this auxiliary field generates a thirring term ( current - current interaction ) that is needed for a proper treatment of the mass term . in order to ensure that @xmath0 is appropriate for analyzing the above mentioned problems",
    ", the symmetry properties of the model will be discussed in 3.2 .",
    "this is followed by section 3.3 where topological properties of u(1 ) gauge fields in two dimensions are reviewed .    in the usual approach ( which is adopted here ) , one first integrates out the fermions .",
    "this gives rise to the fermion determinant which is discussed in chapter 4 .",
    "it will turn out that it does not have a simple structure when the fermions are massive .",
    "thus the strategy will be mass perturbation theory .",
    "the basic formulas needed for this enterprise are derived in section 3.4 .",
    "chapter 4 is dedicated to giving a precise mathematical definition of the so far poorly defined path integral . to this end",
    "i first elaborate on the fermion determinant in an external field ( sections 4.1 , 4.2 ) .",
    "it will turn out that for massless fermions the fermion determinant is gaussian in the external field ( compare e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "together with the action for the gauge field and auxiliary field , respectively , this will amount to common gaussian measures which have a precise mathematical meanig ( section 4.3 ) . in two dimensions gauge fixing",
    "can be used to reduce the gauge field to one scalar degree of freedom .",
    "it is more convenient to work with those scalar fields which are introduced in section 4.4 where i also rewrite the fermion propagator in terms of those variables .",
    "a proper field theory has to obey the cluster decomposition property ( 5.1 ) in order to guarantee the existence of a unique vacuum state .",
    "it turns out that for the expectation functional so far constructed clustering is violated by a certain class of operators which i classify in 5.2 . using the symmetry properties ( section 5.3 ) of those operators the state",
    "can be decomposed into clustering @xmath1-vacua that are introduced in 5.4 .",
    "furthermore it is proven that the new state defines a proper field theory .",
    "this decomposition into clustering states is exactly what is hoped to have been obtained in qcd by introducing the @xmath1-vacuum .",
    "several similarities between the two constructs will be discussed .    in two dimensions",
    "one has the elegant technique of bosonization at hand .",
    "this means that the vacuum expectation values of certain operators can be expressed by vacuum expectation values in a bosonic theory . in section 6.1",
    "i evaluate a generalized generating functional in the massless model which then can be mapped onto a theory of free bosons which is described in 6.2 . in particular the vector currents that are diagonal in flavor space ( _ cartan type currents _ ) have a simple transcription in the bosonic theory",
    ". anyhow one can define currents for all generators of @xmath5 , but it is not possible to find a local bosonization for the whole set of vector currents as i will show in 6.4 .",
    "there i also discuss the hilbert space of the states described by the currents .",
    "having established the bosonized version of the model , it is rather easy to analyze the status of the u(1)-problem of @xmath0 .    by summing up the mass perturbation series one can construct a theory that bosonizes the states described by the cartan currents in terms of a generalized sine gordon theory .",
    "this procedure is a generalization of the coleman isomorphism @xcite and will be discussed in section 7.1 . in section 7.2",
    "i prove that the mass perturbation series converges if a space - time cutoff @xmath6 is imposed . due to the presence of massless degrees of freedom in the bosonic model for more than one flavor the known methods to remove @xmath6 termwise fail .",
    "this rather unpleasent feature of the multiflavor model will be discussed in section 7.3",
    ". nevertheless one can extract interesting physical information ( vacuum structure , mass spectrum ) from a semiclassical approximation of the model ( section 7.4 ) .",
    "this semiclassical spectrum will then be used to test witten - veneziano formulas ( 7.5 ) .    in chapter 8 a generalized version of the fredenhagen - marcu parameter @xcite will be computed , and the confinement properties of the model will be analyzed .    in a short summary",
    "the obtained results will be discussed .",
    "finally i announce the appendices .",
    "appendix a collects material that can be found in the literature , but is included to keep the thesis self contained .",
    "in particular propagators in two dimensions , gaussian measures and wick ordering will be discussed . also a toy example can be found there which illustrates that the set of fields having finite action has measure zero .",
    "appendix b contains formulas that are of more technical nature , and thus were not included in the main part .",
    "the aim of this chapter is to prepare the physical playground for the toy model .",
    "i review the three qcd - topics whose analogues will be analyzed in @xmath0 and point out where criticism is advisable .",
    "almost twenty years ago it was realized by belavin et al .",
    "@xcite , that classical yang - mills theory in euclidean space allows for topologically nontrivial solutions called _",
    "instantons_. they were obtained by analyzing gauge field configurations with finite action .",
    "a sufficient condition for such configurations is to approach a pure gauge when one sends the space - time argument to infinity @xmath7 where @xmath8 are elements of su(n ) .",

    "the instanton @xmath9 in temporal gauge has the property @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 are the pauli matrices and @xmath22 is a real number , the _",
    "instanton size_. for @xmath23 with @xmath24 see e.g. @xmath25 .",
    "due to the @xmath26-tensor in equation ( 2.6 ) only @xmath27 can contribute in the surface integral ( 2.7 ) .",
    "choosing the surface @xmath28 to be integrated over , to be the hypercylinder of figure 2.1 ( next page ) , the winding number ( 2.7 ) takes on the form @xmath12 \\ ; = \\ ; \\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty } \\lim_{v_3 \\rightarrow \\infty } \\frac{g^2}{8 \\pi^2 } \\int_{v_3 } \\ ; d^3x \\ ; \\big(\\ ; k_4 \\ ; \\big|_{x_4 = t } \\ ; - \\ ; k_4 \\ ; \\big|_{x_4 = - t } \\ ; \\big ) \\ ; = : \\ ; \\nu_+[a ] \\ ; - \\ ; \\nu_-[a ] \\ ; .\\ ] ] from equation ( 2.9 ) equation one easily reads off @xmath29 and the same is true for all @xmath30 .",
    "thus 3-space can be compactified to the hypersphere @xmath31 .",
    "since the manifold of su(2 ) is homeomorphic to @xmath31 , the @xmath32 define mappings @xmath33 .",
    "such mappings are known to fall into homotopy classes @xcite .",
    "* figure 2.1 :* the surface @xmath34 . by inserting the asymptotic form ( 2.8 ) for @xmath9 into ( 2.6 )",

    "looking at ( 2.10 ) and ( 2.12 ) one now can interpret the instanton @xmath9 obeying ( 2.8 ) in the following way ( it can be found in e.g. @xcite ) since it is rather lengthy . only the asymptotic form ( 2.8 ) is quoted . for the 2d case",
    "the explicit form will be given in 3.3 . ] .",

    "so far the instanton has only been constructed for the gauge group su(2 ) .",
    "of course one is interested in su(3 ) when dealing with qcd .",
    "in @xcite it is discussed that mappings from @xmath31 to su(3 ) can be deformed continuously into a mapping from @xmath31 to a su(2 ) subgroup .",
    "thus the su(2 ) discussion is already sufficient for su(3 ) .",
    "the configurations @xmath40 for infinite time argument are now considered as classical vacuum states @xmath41 .",
    "the reasoning therefore is the following .",
    "the classical vacua have zero potential energy separated by a barrier @xcite . on the other hand the instanton @xmath42 that connects @xmath43 with @xmath44 has euclidean action @xmath45 .",
    "thus in the wkb sense the @xmath43 to @xmath44 amplitude is of order @xmath46 which is a typical tunneling amplitude @xcite .",
    "a general transition from @xmath43 to @xmath47 can formally be expressed in terms of functional integrals @xmath48 - n \\big ) \\ ; { \\cal d } \\overline{\\psi } { \\cal d } \\psi \\ ; e^{-s_j } \\ ; .\\ ] ] the left hand side denotes the transition from the vacuum @xmath43 at ( euclidean ) time equal to minus infinity to the vacuum @xmath49 at time equal to plus infinity in the presence of sources @xmath50 . since the instanton @xmath9 was identified to mediate such a transition ( see ( 2.10 ) )",
    ", one has to integrate over gauge field configurations within the instanton sector with winding number @xmath51 .",
    "this is formally expressed by the @xmath52-functional in the path integral .",
    "finally @xmath53 denotes the euclidean action plus coupling terms to the sources @xmath50 . obviously the expression ( 2.14 )",
    "does not depend on the vacuum @xmath43 i started with , but only on the difference @xmath51",
    ".    since transitions between the vacua @xmath41 are possible , none of them can be the correct vacuum .",
    "the crucial idea in the construction of the _ @xmath1-vacuum _",
    "@xmath54 is to form a superposition that takes into account all possible transitions . in terms of functional integrals",
    "this can be expressed as ( using ( 2.3 ) in the last step ) @xmath55 @xmath56 - n \\big ) \\ ; e^{i \\theta \\nu[a ] } \\ ; { \\cal d } \\overline{\\psi } { \\cal d } \\psi \\ ; e^{-s_j}\\ ] ] @xmath57 formally ( see e.g. @xcite ) the @xmath1-vacuum can be written as a vector in a hilbert space @xmath58 ) .",
    "the gauge transformation @xmath59 ( see ( 2.9 ) ) that changes @xmath60 to @xmath61 can formally be implemented as an unitary operator @xmath62 in this hilbert space @xcite , and now leaves @xmath54 invariant up to a phase @xmath63 as can be seen from ( 2.15 ) , a new term has entered the action , namely the winding number times a new parameter , the _ vacuum angle _ @xmath1 .",
    "this term causes a serious difficulty , since it violates cp invariance .",
    "this problem is known as the _ strong cp problem _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) for a nice review ) .",
    "there is a second point in the construction of @xmath54 which is rather problematic .",
    "it has been pointed out ( compare the second line of ( 2.15 ) ) , that the measure has to be a sum over all topological sectors .",
    "this requirement is not really mathematically well defined .",
    "functional measures for gauge fields ( if they are constructed at all ) do not live on continuous functions and configurations with finite action have measure zero . the first point can be seen in appendix a.2 on gaussian measures , which are measures on the space of tempered distributions .",
    "gaussian measures are in fact a good illustration , since 2d , u(1 ) gauge theory makes use of them .",
    "the second objection is illustrated in appendix a.3 where i show for a toy example that configurations with finite action have zero measure .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath1-vacuum is a widely accepted concept , and was e.g. invoked to solve the u(1)-problem .",
    "this will be discussed in the next two sections .",
    "i finish this section with remarking that it is generally believed that physics does not depend on @xmath1 , whenever one of the quarks is massless .",
    "the arguments for this make use of the anomaly and will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the symmetry of the qcd lagrangian with three flavors and vanishing quark masses is @xmath64 . in the following i review the argumentation that this symmetry is sponteously broken down to @xmath65 and goldstone particles have to be expected . in the discussion",
    "below , i use the notation of @xcite .    consider the one parameter axial transformations @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the triplet @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "as long as the quark masses vanish , this is a symmetry of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "the corresponding hermitean noether currents are @xmath72 @xmath73 the u(1 ) axial current @xmath74 acquires the anomaly when quantizing the theory and thus will be discussed later .",
    "the other currents are conserved @xmath75 to each conserved current one can define an operator @xmath76 acting on a polynomial @xmath77 of the fields via @xmath78 \\ ; d^3x \\ ; .\\ ] ] the integrals converge due to local commutativity , and are time independent due to conservation of the currents @xcite .",
    "they immediately can be shown to obey @xmath79 and thus are called @xmath80-derivatives .",
    "in @xcite it is discussed how the @xmath80-derivatives generate internal lie - group symmetries of the theory exists for a conserved current @xmath81 , then the unitary operator that performs the underlying symmetry transformation is given by @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the second term in an expansion of @xmath84 in @xmath85 . ] .",
    "now the question is if these symmetries can be implemented unitarily or are spontaneously broken .",
    "first i assume that the unitary implementation is possible .",
    "this means that there exists an unitary operator @xmath86 depending continuously on the element @xmath87 of the symmetry group and the symmetry operates via @xmath88 as is discussed in @xcite this then implies @xmath89 and @xmath90 since the right hand side of ( 2.22 ) does not depend on time , @xmath91 \\ ; = \\ ; 0 \\ ; .\\ ] ] consider now an eigenstate @xmath92 of the hamiltonian with energy @xmath93 .",
    "due to ( 2.26 ) @xmath94 is an eigenstate with the same energy @xmath95 since the axial vector currents have odd parity , a parity transformation @xmath96 acts on @xmath94 via @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the parity of the eigenstate @xmath99 .",
    "thus if one of the symmetries generated by the conserved currents @xmath100 were realized unitarily , this would imply that the hadrons come in parity doublets . since the parity partners are not seen in experiment ,",
    "the assumption of unitary implementability is wrong , and all those symmetries have to be broken spontaneously .",
    "the breaking of the symmetry for each single one paramter group generated by one of the conserved currents @xmath100 implies the existence of 8 goldstone particles .",
    "the corresponding massless states @xmath101 are connected to the vacuum via @xmath102 the whole discussion above made use of vanishing quark masses .",
    "since these masses are known to be nonzero , the goldstone particles are only approximate goldstone bosons .",
    "nevertheless the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath103 can be properly identified to play this role .",
    "so far the u(1)-current was excluded since it acquires the anomaly @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the number of flavors .",
    "this implies that the action of the corresponding @xmath80-derivative on some polynomial @xmath77 of the fields @xmath106 is not time independent .    using bardeen s identity ( @xcite , @xcite , compare ( 2.5 ) , ( 2.6 ) ) @xmath107 @xmath108",
    "one can define a new current @xmath109 which now is conserved @xmath110 one can also define a @xmath80-derivative @xmath111 @xmath112 \\ ; d^3x \\ ; , \\ ] ] corresponding to the new current @xmath113 .",
    "all the arguments ( 2.23 ) - ( 2.29 ) can be repeated and a ninth pseudoscalar particle can be expected .",
    "one would like to interpret the @xmath114 in that sense .",
    "the common wisdom is that @xmath114 is to heavy to be this approximate goldstone boson .",
    "this belief is based on a work by weinberg @xcite where the case of two flavors is considered . there",
    "the @xmath115 should play the role of the u(1 ) goldstone particle . to interpret the @xmath115 in this sence , the mass relation @xmath116 has to be obeyed . inserting the experimental values for the masses ( @xmath117 )",
    ", one finds that the @xmath115 is not the wanted goldstone particle .",
    "the same reasoning can be done for three flavors , and the u(1)-problem can be formulated :    _ where is the ninth , light , pseudoscalar meson ? _",
    "if one reanalyzes the arguments for the u(1)-current more carefully , one finds that @xmath118 defined in ( 2.32 ) is not gauge invariant , and thus @xmath119 is not a physical operator .",
    "as discussed in @xmath120 it is not obvious that local commutativity which is needed to establish the convergence of the integral ( 2.35 ) should and can be required for non - physical operators .",
    "so it has to be doubted that @xmath111 is well defined and generates a symmetry on the physical hilbert space .",
    "it is unclear if the u(1)-problem is well posed .",
    "ignoring this criticism , one can formally define a charge @xmath121 that corresponds to the current @xmath122 ( compare footnote 3 on page 12 ) @xmath123 this can now be used to argue that physics does not depend on @xmath1 if the quarks are massless , as has been mentioned in the last section can also be introduced by modifying one of the mass terms to @xmath124 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if one of quark masses is zero , this modification vanishes and so the @xmath1 dependence . ] .",
    "as has already been pointed out , @xmath121 is not gauge invariant .",
    "in particular under the gauge transformation @xmath59 ( see equation ( 2.9 ) ) which changes @xmath125 @xmath126\\ ] ] @xmath127 in the last equation i used ( 2.33 ) and ( 2.12 ) . now one can perform a chiral rotation on @xmath128 @xmath129 and use ( 2.37 ) to obtain @xmath130 @xmath131 since @xmath121 stems from a current which is conserved if the quarks are massless , it is formally time independent , and hence commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "thus the chirally rotated state @xmath132 can also serve as the vacuum. from equation ( 2.39 ) it follows that @xmath133 and thus the theories are equivalent for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "the argument fails for massive quarks , since then @xmath119 is not conserved .",
    "arguments at the same level of rigor were used by t hooft to solve the u(1)-problem @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the nontrivial structure of the qcd vacuum leads to a vanishing residue of the u(1)-goldstone pole in propagators of physical ( i.e. gauge invariant ) operators .",
    "the crucial formula ( see @xcite ) for the cancellation of the residue is the following structure for the vacuum expecation value of an operator @xmath77 in the @xmath1-vacuum @xmath134 with the remarkable property @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the chiral u(1)-charge of @xmath77 .",
    "the last equation can be seen to hold by the following formal arguments @xcite . from ( 2.37 ) there follows for the operators @xmath137 and @xmath121 that @xmath138 .",
    "if the states for different vacuum topology @xmath139 are defined as @xmath140 with @xmath141 then there follows @xmath142 .",
    "however since @xmath121 is formally conserved one concludes @xmath143 . in general",
    "one must find @xmath144 where @xmath77 is an operator of chirality @xmath145 .",
    "inserting this into the first line of ( 2.15 ) one ends up with ( 2.41 ) .      in 1979",
    "witten proposed a formula that relates the mass of the @xmath114 meson to the topological susceptibility of quarkless qcd .",
    "the remarkable feature of the result is that it does not make use of instantons .",
    "the main ingredient of the proof is that physics does not depend on the vacuum angle @xmath1 when massless quarks are present ( compare section 2.2 ) .",
    "this observation can be related to the topological susceptibility .",
    "consider the free energy density @xmath146 where the partition function in finite volume @xmath147 is formally defined as @xmath148 the second derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath1 gives the topological susceptibility @xmath149 @xmath150 with @xmath151 where @xmath152 denotes time ordering .",
    "as discussed , physics does not depend on @xmath1 if the quarks are massless .",
    "it follows that @xmath149 has to vanish then .",
    "more generally witten considers the propagator @xmath153 @xmath154 adopting some @xmath155-expansion arguments @xcite , @xcite the propagator is rewritten as @xmath156 the first sum also contributes in a theory without any quarks ( massless or massive ) and is denoted as @xmath157 then .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath155 , this term does not change if the quarks are coupled . on the other hand the right hand side of ( 2.49 )",
    "has to vanish in the presence of massless quarks at @xmath158 .",
    "ignoring the fact that both sums have the same sign , witten claims that they cancel each other .",
    "the condition in lowest order of @xmath155 is ( which would be mathematically correct if there was an extra minus sign ) @xmath159 using the anomaly equation ( 2.31 ) to rewrite @xmath160 in terms of the decay constant @xmath161 , witten ends up with @xmath162 where @xmath105 is the number of flavors and @xmath163 is the topological susceptibility in pure su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "it has to be remarked that @xmath161 should be evaluated in qcd with vanishing quark masses as can be seen from the derivation above . from pcac arguments",
    "it follows that @xmath161 varies only very slowly in the mass variable ( see e.g. @xcite ) and thus the experimental value can be inserted .",
    "although the derivation is problematic ( besides the sign problem , questions concerning regularization were ignored ) the formula seems to have some truth in it .",
