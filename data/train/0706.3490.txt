    "in the last few years , research of complex networks have become a focus of attention from the scientific community  @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons behind the popularity of complex networks is their flexibility and generality for representing real systems in nature and society .",
    "researchers have done a lot of empirical studies , uncovering that various real - life networks sharing some generic properties : power - law degree distribution  @xcite , small - world effect including small average path length ( apl ) and high clustering coefficient  @xcite .",
    "recently , many authors have described some real - world systems in terms of weighted networks , where an interesting empirical phenomenon has been observed that there exists a power - law scaling relation between the strength @xmath0 and degree @xmath1 of nodes , i.e. @xmath2 with @xmath3  @xcite .    with the intention of studying the above properties of real - world systems , a wide variety of models",
    "have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "watts and strogatz , in their pioneering paper , introduced the famous small - world network model ( ws model )  @xcite , which exhibits small apl and high clustering coefficient .",
    "another well - known model is barabsi and albert s scale - free network model ( ba model )  @xcite , which has a degree distribution of power - law form .",
    "however , in these two elegant models , scale - free feature and high clustering are exclusive . driven by the two seminal papers  @xcite , a considerable number of other models have been developed that may represent processes more realistically taking place in real - world networks  @xcite .",
    "very recently , barrat , barthlemy , and vespignani have introduced a model ( bbv ) for the growth of weighted networks  @xcite , which is the first weighted network model that yields a scale - free behavior for strength and degree distributions .",
    "enlightened by bbv s remarkable work , various weighted network models have been proposed to explain the properties found in real systems  @xcite . these models may give some insight into the realities .",
    "particulary , some of them presente all the above - mentioned three characteristics such as power - law degree distribution , small - world effect , and power - law strength - degree correlation  @xcite .",
    "although great progresses have been made in the research of network topology , modeling complex networks with general structural properties is still of current interest .    on the other hand , fractals are an important tool for the investigation of physical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "they were used to describe physical characteristics of things in nature and life systems such as clouds , trees , mountains , rivers , coastlines , waves on a lake , bronchi , and the human circulatory system , to mention but a few",
    ". a vast literature on the theory and application of fractals has appeared . among many deterministic and statistical fractals ,",
    "the sierpinski gasket  @xcite is one of the earliest deterministic fractals ; it has provided a rich source for examples of fractal behavior  @xcite .",
    "our initial physical motivation for this work lies in the use of the sierpinski gasket as models for complex networks .    in this letter , based on the well - known sierpinski family fractals",
    ", we introduce a class of deterministic networks , named sierpinski networks .",
    "we propose a minimal iterative algorithm for constructing the networks and studying their structural properties .",
    "the networks are maximal planar graphs , show scale - free distributions of degree and strength , exhibit small - world effect , and display power - law strength - degree correlation , which may provide valuable insights into the real - life systems .",
    "we first introduce a family of fractals , called sierpinski fractals , by generalizing the construction of the sierpinski gasket . the classic sierpinski gasket , shown in fig 1(a ) ,",
    "is constructed as follows  @xcite .",
    "we start with an equilateral triangle , and we denote this initial configuration by generation @xmath4 . then in the first generation @xmath5 , the three sides of the equilateral triangle are bisected and the central triangle removed .",
    "this forms three copies of the original triangle , and the procedure is repeated indefinitely for all the new copies . in the limit of infinite @xmath6 generations , we obtain the well - known sierpinski gasket denoted by @xmath7 . another fractal based on the equilateral triangle can be obtained if we perform a trisection of the sides and remove the three down pointing triangles , to form six copies of the original triangle . continue this procedure in each copy recursively to form a gasket , denoted @xmath8 , shown in fig .",
    "indeed , this can be generalized to @xmath9 , for any positive integer @xmath10 with @xmath11 , by dividing the sides in @xmath10 , joining these points and removing all the downward pointing triangles  @xcite .",
    "thus , we obtain a family of fractals ( sierpinski fractals ) , whose hausdorff dimension is @xmath12/\\log(\\omega)$ ] , which tends to 2 as @xmath13  @xcite .     the first two stages in the construction of two fractals from the family of sierpinski gaskets .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one can use these fractals to construct networks . the translation from the fractals to network generation",
    "is quite straightforward .",
    "let the nodes ( vertices ) of the networks correspond to the removed triangles and make two nodes connected if the boundaries of the corresponding triangles contact one another . for uniformity",
    ", the three sides of the initial equilateral triangle at step 0 also correspond to three different nodes .",
    "figure 2 shows a network based on @xmath14 .",
    "all generated networks have similar properties .",
    "in what follows we will focus on the particular network corresponding to the case of @xmath15 ( see figure  [ network ] ) , which is also called sierpinski network , and other cases can be treated analogously .",
    "illustration of a deterministic network in relation to @xmath14 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in the construction process of @xmath8 , for each equilateral triangle at arbitrary generation , once we perform a trisection of its sides and remove the three resultant down pointing triangles , six copies of it are formed .",
    "when building the network , it is equivalent that for every group of three new added nodes , six new small equilateral triangles are generated , each of which may create three nodes in the next generation . according to this",
    ", we can introduce a general algorithm to create the corresponding network , denoted by @xmath16 after @xmath6 generation evolutions .    the iterative algorithm for the network",
    "is as follows : for @xmath4 , @xmath17 consists of three nodes forming a triangle .",
    "then , we add three nodes into the original triangle .",
    "these three new nodes are linked to each other shaping a new triangle , and both ends of each edge of the new triangle are connected to a node of the original triangle .",
    "thus we get @xmath18 , see figure  [ iterative ] . for @xmath19 , @xmath16",
    "is obtained from @xmath20 . for each of the existing triangles of @xmath20 that is not composed of three simultaneously emerging nodes and has never generated a node before",
    ", we call it an active triangle . we replace each of the existing active triangles of @xmath20 by the connected cluster on the right hand of figure 3 to obtain @xmath16 .",
    "the growing process is repeated until the network reaches a desired order ( node number of network ) .",
    "figure  [ network ] shows the network growing process for the first two steps .",
    "iterative construction method for the network .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    next we compute the order and size ( number of all edges ) of the network @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 be the number of vertices , edges and active triangles created at step @xmath6 , respectively . by construction",
    "( see also figure  [ iterative ] ) , each active triangle in @xmath20 will be replaced by six active triangles in @xmath16 .",
    "thus , it is not difficult to find the following relation : @xmath24 . since @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 .",
    "note that each active triangle in @xmath20 will lead to an addition of three new nodes and nine new edges at step @xmath6 , then one can easily obtain the following relations : @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for arbitrary @xmath29 . from these results , we can compute the order and size of the network . the total number of vertices @xmath30 and edges @xmath31 present at step @xmath6 is @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "so for large @xmath6 , the average degree @xmath34 is approximately @xmath35 , which shows the network is sparse as most real systems .    from eqs .",
    "( [ nt ] ) and  ( [ et ] ) , we have @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , by the very construction of the network , it is obvious that arbitrary two edges in the network never cross each other .",
    "thus our network is a maximal planar network ( or graph )  @xcite , which is similar to some previously studied networks  @xcite .",
    "now we study the statistical properties of the network , in terms of degree distribution , clustering coefficient , average path length , and strength distribution .      when a new node @xmath37 is added to the graph at step @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , it has a degree of @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the number of active triangles at step @xmath6 that will create new nodes connected to the node @xmath37 at step @xmath42 . then at step @xmath38 , @xmath43 . from the iterative generation process of the network , one can see that at any step each two new neighbors of @xmath37 generate three new active triangles with involving @xmath37 , and one of its existing active triangle is deactivated simultaneously .",
    "we define @xmath44 as the degree of node @xmath37 at time @xmath6 , then the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath41 satisfies : @xmath45 now we compute @xmath41 . by construction , @xmath46 . considering the initial condition @xmath47 , we can derive @xmath48 . then at time @xmath6 , the degree of vertex @xmath37 becomes @xmath49    it should be mentioned that the initial three vertices created at step 0 have a little different evolution process from other ones .",
    "we can easily obtain : @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "so at step @xmath6 , initial three vertices have the same degrees as those ones born at step 1 .",
    "equation  ( [ ki ] ) shows that the degree spectrum of the network is discrete .",
    "it follows that the cumulative degree distribution  @xcite is given by @xmath52 substituting for @xmath38 in this expression using @xmath53 gives @xmath54 when @xmath6 is large enough , one can obtain @xmath55}.\\ ] ] so the degree distribution follows a power law form with the exponent @xmath56 .",
    "the clustering coefficient  @xcite @xmath57 of node @xmath37 is defined as the ratio between the number of edges @xmath58 that actually exist among the @xmath59 neighbors of node @xmath37 and its maximum possible value , @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "the clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average of @xmath62 over all nodes in the network .    for our network ,",
    "the analytical expression of clustering coefficient @xmath63 for a single node with degree @xmath1 can be derived exactly .",
    "when a node enters the system , both @xmath64 and @xmath58 are 4 . in the following iterations ,",
    "each of its active triangles increases both @xmath65 and @xmath66 by 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath66 equals to @xmath67 for all nodes at all steps .",
    "so one can see that there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the degree of a node and its clustering . for a node of degree @xmath1",
    ", we have @xmath68}{k(k-1)}=\\frac{4}{k}-\\frac{1}{k-1}.\\ ] ] in the limit of large @xmath1 , @xmath63 is inversely proportional to degree @xmath1 .",
    "the same scaling of @xmath69 has also been observed in several real - life networks  @xcite .",
    "semilogarithmic plot of average clustering coefficient @xmath70 versus network order @xmath71.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    using eq .",
    "( [ ck ] ) , we can obtain the clustering @xmath70 of the networks at step @xmath6 : @xmath72,\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all the nodes and @xmath73 is the degree of the nodes created at step @xmath74 , which is given by eq .",
    "( [ ki ] ) . in the infinite network order limit ( @xmath75 ) , eq .",
    "( [ acc ] ) converges to a nonzero value @xmath76 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ clustering ] . therefore , the average clustering coefficient of the network is very high .",
    "shortest paths play an important role both in the transport and communication within a network and in the characterization of the internal structure of the network .",
    "we represent all the shortest path lengths of @xmath16 as a matrix in which the entry @xmath77 is the geodesic path from node @xmath37 to node @xmath78 , where geodesic path is one of the paths connecting two nodes with minimum length .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath77 is called the diameter of the network .",
    "a measure of the typical separation between two nodes in @xmath16 is given by the average path length @xmath79 , also known as characteristic path length , defined as the mean of geodesic lengths over all couples of nodes .",
    "average path length @xmath79 versus network order @xmath71 on a semilogarithmic scale .",
    "the solid line is a guide to the eye.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ distance ] , we report the dependence relation of apl @xmath79 on network size @xmath71 . from fig .",
    "[ distance ] , one can see that the average path length grows logarithmically with increasing size of the network .",
    "this logarithmic scaling of @xmath79 with network size @xmath71 , together with the large clustering coefficient obtained in the preceding subsection , shows that the considered graph has a small - world effect .",
    "strength usually represents resources or substances allocated to each node , such as wealth of individuals in financial contact networks  @xcite , the number of passengers in airports in world - wide airport networks  @xcite , the throughput of power stations in electric power grids  @xcite , and so on . in our model , the strength of a node is defined as the area of the removed triangle it corresponds to  @xcite . for uniformity ,",
    "let the initial three nodes born at step 0 have the same strength as those created at step 1 .",
    "we assume that the area of the initial equilateral triangle of the sierpinski gasket is @xmath80 . by the very construction of the network ,",
    "all simultaneously emerging nodes have the same strength , because their corresponding triangles have identical area .",
    "it is easy to find that each removed triangle covers the portion @xmath81 of one removed triangle in the preceding generation .",
    "after @xmath6 iterations , all nodes which are generated at a certain step @xmath82 have the strength @xmath83 : @xmath84 from which we have @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the area @xmath87 of a triangle removed at step @xmath6 .",
    "( [ ki ] ) and  ( [ s02 ] ) yield a power - law correlation between strength and degree of a node : @xmath88 which implies when @xmath1 is large enough , @xmath89 .",
    "this nontrivial power - law scaling between strength of a node and its degree has been empirically observed in a variety of real networks , such as the airport networks , the shareholder networks , and the internet .",
    "analogously to computation of degree distribution , we one can find that the strength distribution is also scale - free with exponent @xmath90 as : @xmath91    as known to us all , for weighted networks with non - linear strength - degree correlation @xmath92 , if their distributions of degree and strength behave as power laws , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , then there is a general relation between @xmath95 and @xmath90 as  @xcite : @xmath96 we have shown that in our model @xmath56 and @xmath97 . according to eq .",
    "( [ gammas02 ] ) , the exponent of strength distribution is @xmath98 , giving the same @xmath90 value as that obtained in the direct calculation of the strength distribution , see equation ( [ gammas01 ] ) .",
    "deterministic model makes it easier to gain a visual understanding of how do different nodes relate to each other forming complex networks  @xcite . on the basis of sierpinski fractals ,",
    "we have proposed and studied a kind of deterministic networks . according to the network construction processes we have presented an algorithm to generate the networks , based on which we have obtained the analytical results for degree distribution , clustering coefficient , strength distribution , as well as strength - degree correlation .",
    "we have shown that the networks have three important properties : power - law distributions , small - world effect , and power - law strength - degree correlation , which are in good accordance with a variety of real - life networks .",
    "in addition , the networks are maximal planar graphs , which may be helpful for designing printed circuits .",
    "although we have studied only a particular network , in a similar way , one can easily investigate other sierpinski networks with various values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and their general properties such as small - world effect and power - law strength - degree relation are similar .",
    "moreover , using the idea presented , one can also establish random networks , which display similar features as their deterministic counterparts studied here .",
    "as the classic sierpinski gaskets are important for the understanding of geometrical fractals in real systems , we believe that our research could be useful in the understanding and modeling of real - world networks .",
