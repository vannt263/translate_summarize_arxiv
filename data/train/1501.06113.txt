    "shell model approach accounts for correlations and shell effects but conventional diagonalization methods are limited by the size of the many - particle model space .",
    "the auxiliary - field monte carlo ( afmc ) method enables calculation of thermal observables and ground state properties in model spaces that are many orders of magnitude larger than model spaces that can be treated by conventional diagonalization methods . in nuclear physics this method is also known as the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) method  @xcite .",
    "smmc has proven to be a powerful method in calculating statistical and collective properties of nuclei  @xcite .    here",
    "we review recent advances in the development and application of smmc to nuclei .",
    "in particular , we describe a method to circumvent the sign problem that arises from the projection on an odd number of particles and its application to calculate pairing gaps in mid - mass nuclei and level densities of odd - mass isotopes .",
    "we also discuss the application of smmc to describe the microscopic emergence of collectivity in heavy rare - earth nuclei and present results for the collective enhancement factors of level densities in such nuclei .",
    "the afmc method utilizes the hubbard - stratonovich transformation  @xcite , in which the imaginary - time propagator @xmath0 of a nucleus that is described by a hamiltonian @xmath1 at inverse temperature @xmath2 is represented by a functional integral of one - body propagators of non - interacting nucleons over external auxiliary fields @xmath3",

    "afmc often suffers from a sign problem at low temperatures .",
    "however , there are classes of good - sign interactions that are free of the sign problem and are composed of the dominant collective components of effective nuclear interactions  @xcite .",

    "applications of smmc to odd - even and odd - odd nuclei have been hampered by a sign problem that originates from the projection on a odd number of particles .",

    "a breakthrough was a method we introduced to calculate accurately the ground - state energy of an odd - particle system that circumvents this sign problem  @xcite .",

    "collective states in these nuclei lead to enhancement of their state density , which is described by a collective enhancement factor @xmath76 .",
    "the decay of @xmath76 with excitation energy is one of the least understood topics in the modeling of level densities  @xcite , and it is often parameterized by empirical formulas .",
    "we define a collective enhancement factor by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the total smmc state density and @xmath79 is the level density calculated in the finite - temperature hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation .",
    "the latter describes the density of intrinsic states and thus the above ratio is a measure of the enhancement in the number of states due to collective states that are built on top of the intrinsic states .",

    "we also show by arrows the energies of the various thermal phase transitions that occur in the hfb approximation .",
    "the thin arrows correspond to the pairing transitions ( for both protons and neutrons ) , while the thick arrows describe the shape transitions .",
    "the spherical nuclei @xmath66nd do not support rotational bands , so the enhancement factor @xmath76 is due to vibrational states alone .",
    "we observe that this vibrational enhancement factor decays to @xmath80 at excitation energies above the proton and neutron pairing transitions .",
    "the heavier neodymium isotopes @xmath81nd are deformed in their ground state .",
    "we observe that @xmath76 has a local minimum above the pairing transitions , which we attribute to the interplay between the decay of vibrational collectivity and the enhancement due to rotational collectivity .",
