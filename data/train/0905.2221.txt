    "being a discovery machine , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will hopefully uncover any new physics close to the electroweak scale . in particular , the several variants of the seesaw mechanism proposed to explain light neutrino masses can be tested  @xcite . in case that one of these mechanisms is responsible for the light neutrino mass generation and seesaw messengers",
    "exist around the tev scale or below , positive signals could be observed at lhc .",
    "there are three types of tree - level seesaw which can originate light neutrino majorana masses .",
    "the original seesaw @xcite , also known as seesaw i , introduces right - handed neutrino singlets @xmath2 .",
    "seesaw ii @xcite enlarges the sm with a complex scalar triplet @xmath8 with hypercharge @xmath9 , which contains three scalars @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "seesaw iii @xcite introduces lepton triplets @xmath13 with @xmath14 , each containing a charged lepton @xmath15 and a neutral one @xmath2 . in these three seesaw mechanisms ,",
    "the lepton number violating ( lnv ) operator  @xcite @xmath16 is generated after integration of the heavy degrees of freedom , where @xmath17 are the sm lepton doublets with @xmath18 a flavour index , and @xmath19 is the sm higgs .",
    "subsequently , when electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken , this operator gives light neutrino majorana masses .",
    "the scale at which this operator is generated ( _ i.e. _ the mass scale of the seesaw messengers ) is not necessarily very high but it might happen that it is around the tev . in this case , the new leptons predicted in models of type - i and type - iii seesaw might be produced at lhc . for seesaw iii ,",
    "if the new heavy states @xmath15 , @xmath2 have masses up to several hundreds of gev , they can be produced and observed at lhc already at the low luminosity phase  @xcite .",
    "for seesaw i , the production of heavy neutrino singlets @xmath2 through sm interactions is very suppressed because of the small heavy neutrino mixing with sm particles , and signals are unobservable except for relatively `` light '' masses around 150 gev  @xcite . however ,",
    "if new interactions exist , either @xmath20 bosons  @xcite , @xmath3 bosons  @xcite or new scalars @xcite , heavy neutrino singlets can be copiously produced , either singly or in pairs depending on the model .",
    "the observability of the seesaw i ",
    "iii signals and the discrimination among these models has been investigated in ref .  @xcite . there ,",
    "an exhaustive analysis of all final states was carried out with a complete signal and background calculation , and the characteristic features of each seesaw model were highlighted . in this paper",
    "we will perform a complementary analysis .",
    "our main objective here is to identify the relevant signals whose observation or non - observation would discriminate among different models with new heavy leptons . in particular",
    ", we want to design a strategy to determine if new leptons eventually observed at lhc could mediate a type - i or type - iii seesaw mechanism",
    ". we will study heavy lepton pair production @xmath21 where @xmath15 generically denotes a heavy charged lepton and @xmath2 a neutral one , in several sm extensions with new leptons in different @xmath5 representations .",
    "we consider the following additions to the sm particle content :    * a majorana lepton triplet @xmath13 , containing a charged lepton @xmath15 and a majorana neutrino @xmath2 .",
    "generically , three such triplets appear in minimal seesaw iii realisations , but as in previous studies @xcite we restrict our calculations to the lightest one . * a dirac lepton triplet @xmath13 .",
    "this is an alternative to the minimal seesaw iii in which two ( quasi-)degenerate majorana triplets @xmath22 , @xmath23 with opposite cp parities form a ( quasi-)dirac triplet @xmath13  @xcite , in analogy with the sometimes called `` inverse '' type - i seesaw with heavy dirac neutrinos  @xcite . in this case",
    "the heavy states are two charged leptons @xmath24 , @xmath25 and a dirac neutrino @xmath2 . * a lepton isodoublet @xmath26 , in which the heavy neutrino @xmath2 is likely to have ( quasi-)dirac character .",
    "a lepton isodoublet can not generate the operator in eq .",
    "( [ ec : o5 ] ) but this does not exclude the possibility that they exist , independently of the neutrino mass generation mechanism . * a charged lepton isosinglet @xmath15 , which can also exist independently of the neutrino mass generation .",
    "* a majorana singlet @xmath2 and an extra gauge boson @xmath3 .",
    "for definiteness we work with an @xmath27 model with a leptophobic @xmath28 boson and heavy majorana neutrinos @xcite , assuming that only one of them , with mass @xmath29 , can be produced in @xmath28 decays .",
    "but the results obtained here are general because the relative rate of the multi - lepton signals produced in @xmath30 is only determined by the heavy majorana neutrino decay channels , and the particular type of @xmath3 boson considered only affects the total production cross section . therefore , the results shown here can be applied to other models  @xcite with a trivial rescaling . * a dirac singlet @xmath2 , formed by two majorana singlets , and an extra @xmath3 boson .",
    "we work with the same model in ref .",
    "@xcite but assuming that two majorana neutrinos form a ( quasi-)dirac neutrino .    in all the models enumerated above ,",
    "one or more heavy lepton pairs @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 can be produced in hadron collisions .",
    "moreover , in the case of lepton doublets and triplets the two states @xmath15 , @xmath2 are almost degenerate in mass . but because the production processes and especially the heavy lepton decay channels are different in each model , the final state signatures are characteristic and the models can be distinguished already at lhc , without the need of precise measurements at a future collider like ilc .",
    "the model discrimination relies on the simultaneous analysis of different final states with two , three and four leptons , and the reconstruction of peaks in invariant mass distributions .",
    "we will find that the trilepton signal @xmath4 , with @xmath34 , is common to all models introducing a heavy neutrino , singlet but with a very small branching ratio . ] and has a small sm background .",
    "therefore , it constitutes the golden channel for heavy neutrino searches at lhc , in particular for the search of seesaw messengers .",
    "moreover , the study of this channel can also reveal if a heavy neutrino eventually observed belongs to a triplet or not .",
    "its dirac or majorana nature can be determined in the like - sign dilepton final state : the observation of a @xmath6 signal without missing energy clearly indicates its majorana character whereas the absence of such signal points towards one of the other models .",
    "like - sign dileptons but with large missing energy can distinguish dirac triplets , which give a large and observable signal , from dirac doublets and singlets which give much smaller ones . finally , the model identification is completed with the analysis of four lepton signals and the search of a resonance in the total invariant mass distribution .    we must point out that the models considered in this paper do not exhaust all possibilities for the addition of heavy leptons and/or new interactions to the sm , but rather constitute the cases in which model discrimination seems hardest because the heavy leptons are nearly degenerate , they always decay into a light lepton plus a @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath37 boson and their charge can not be measured in hadronic decays .",
    "two possibilities not covered here , in which model discrimination is easier , are :    * a fourth sm generation of chiral leptons . in this case , the mass splitting between the mass eigenstates is expected to be large to be consistent with precise electroweak data  @xcite , unlike in the cases examined here . apart from this distinctive characteristic , the leading decay of the charged lepton would be @xmath38 , so that @xmath31 production would produce events in which the mass resonances have more jets than in the models discussed here .",
    "moreover , anomaly cancellation requires the presence of new quarks with masses of few hundreds of gev ( or new fermions with the same quantum numbers , giving rise to observable resonances @xcite ) , which would be produced in pairs and observed already with a relatively small luminosity  @xcite . * a majorana neutrino coupling to a new @xmath20 boson , as for example those appearing in left - right models . in this case",
    "the heavy neutrino can be produced in association with a light lepton , @xmath39 this process gives signals with up to three charged leptons in some regions of parameter space  @xcite , but they can be clearly distinguished from heavy lepton pair production by the reconstruction of only one heavy resonance which , together with an energetic light lepton , produces a jacobian peak at the @xmath20 mass .    in this work",
    "we do not consider scalar triplet production ( seesaw ii ) either , which gives signals kinematically very different with sharp peaks in like - sign dilepton invariant mass distributions .",
    "it is interesting , however , to note that in seesaw ii the trilepton signals are the most important as well  @xcite .",
    "multi - lepton signals can also appear in pair production of new quarks  @xcite but they can be easily distinguished from the models studied here by mass reconstruction and also by the presence of significant single lepton signals with several @xmath40-tagged jets .    the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "after this introduction , we briefly summarise in section  [ sec:2 ] the relevant lagrangian terms , the production processes at lhc and the decay channels of the heavy leptons in the models studied . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we describe how the signals and backgrounds are simulated .",

    "moreover , the trilepton final state is the only one in which the presence of a neutral heavy particle ( reconstructed as a peak in the invariant mass of two opposite - charge leptons plus missing energy ) can be established . and , with a higher luminosity , it can establish the triplet nature of the heavy neutrino . on the other hand",

    "large @xmath6 signals are produced in several of the models studied , not only from lnv processes ( as in the case of a heavy majorana neutrino ) but also from lnc ones ( as for a dirac triplet ) , being the main difference the presence of final state neutrinos in the latter case .",
    "therefore , we have performed two different analyses for the like - sign dilepton final state . in the first one our selection criteria ,",
    "in particular the absence of significant missing energy , suppress the like - sign dilepton signals produced in lnc processes and efficiently isolate the true lnv ones , so that an eventually observed signal would correspond to a majorana neutrino and its absence would indicate its dirac character . in the second one we have required the opposite : large missing energy . with this novel analysis",
    "we have found that dirac triplets give large and observable @xmath6 signals with large missing energy , while doublets and singlets do not .",

    "the information of this four lepton channel is complemented by other indications , such as the observation of a peak at @xmath97 in the trilepton final state with a @xmath36 candidate , or of a resonance in the heavy lepton pair invariant mass distribution , which help identify the underlying model with a luminosity not much larger than the one required for @xmath96 discovery .",

    "in this paper we have shown that , if a positive signal of new heavy leptons is found , the six models considered can be discriminated already at lhc with the study of multi - lepton signals , without the need of heavy lepton coupling measurements at future colliders .",
    "an extra bonus of our comparative analysis is that it provides a guide of consistency checks to be performed ( and final states to be investigated ) in case that a multi - lepton event excess compatible with heavy lepton pair production is found at lhc .",
    "we have assumed the higgs boson to be light , as preferred by electroweak precision data , taking a mass of 115 gev .",
    "for a heavier higgs the results are expected to be similar although a dedicated analysis is required .",
    "our study has been done at the level of a fast detector simulation of all the signal contributions ( which is a non - trivial task ) and the relevant sm backgrounds .",
    "the former is important , because there are many possible decay channels for the heavy leptons , and usually several of them contribute to a final state with a given charged lepton multiplicity .",
    "the latter is important as well .",
    "although our simulation is not as detailed as one with a complete detector description , it incorporates some of the features found in real experiments , which parton - level analyses fail to correctly estimate .",
