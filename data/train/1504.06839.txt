    "interestingly , both of the stable ( [ algebra ] ) and snyder ( [ snyder - algebra ] ) algebras could be obtained from a ten - dimensional phase space associated to a constrained relativistic particle in five dimensions in the context of dsr theories . fixing the constraint , the stable algebra ( [ algebra ] ) and snyder algebra ( [ snyder - algebra ] )",

    "but , it seems that the stable algebra ( [ algebra ] ) is more satisfactory since it could take into account a universal minimal length in a lorentz - invariant manner as well as snyder algebra ( [ snyder - algebra ] ) and , moreover , it is also a stable algebra from the mathematical point of view .",
    "however , when one studies the heisenberg subalgebra in the non - relativistic limit to obtain the density of states , depending on the choice of spatial momenta , as we will show , both of them could suggest the same modification to the six - dimensional phase space volume .",
    "a full representation of the stable algebra ( [ algebra ] ) by differential operators in a five - dimensional manifold with commutative coordinates @xmath12 and flat metric @xmath13 is given by @xcite @xmath14 to obtain the deformed density of states , we restrict ourselves to a subalgebra containing @xmath15 with @xmath16 , that replaces the standard heisenberg algebra in this setup .",
    "also we fix @xmath17 since , as we will see , this choice leads to the compactification of the spatial momenta space and a universal spatial maximal momentum arises for this case . for a fixed @xmath18 , in @xmath19-basis ,",

    "@xcite for more details ) , @xmath28 which is not exact since it is obtained in the spirit of the subalgebra ( [ sub - rep ] ) . an important result , which is also clear from the relation ( [ pk ] ) , is that there is an spatial maximal momentum as @xmath29 in this setup .",
    "also , the deformed density of states ( [ dos ] ) shows that the phase space volume expands at high momentum regime .",
    "thus , the main result of this section is that : the stable algebra of relativistic quantum mechanics ( [ algebra ] ) suggests the deformation to the density of states as the relation ( [ dos ] ) .",
    "the standard state density could be recovered in the limit of @xmath30 .",
    "the deformed density of states ( [ dos ] ) is also suggested by three - dimensional dsr as a flat limit for quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "although the stable ( [ algebra ] ) and snyder ( [ snyder - algebra ] ) algebras are different in four - dimensional spacetime , the deformed phase space volume which underlies the density of states ( [ dos ] ) is also obtained from the non - relativistic ( subalgebra ) of the snyder algebra @xcite .",
    "the reason for this coincidence will become clear when one pays attention to the topology of the both of four - momentum and spatial momentum spaces . indeed , the topology of the four - momentum space of the minkowski spacetime with standard non - deformed poincar algebra is @xmath31 ( flat momentum space ) and there is not a universal maximal spatial momentum or maximum energy for the system under consideration .",
    "but , it is well - known that the topology of the four - momentum space of the dsr theories is de sitter geometry with @xmath32 @xcite . identifying @xmath33 with energy and @xmath34 with spatial momenta",
    ", a universal maximal momentum ( corresponds to a minimal observer - independent length ) naturally arises which is completely determined by the radius of three - sphere @xmath34 or equivalently with curvature of de sitter four - momentum space .",
    "since both of the stable algebra ( [ algebra ] ) and snyder algebra ( [ snyder - algebra ] ) could be realized from the de sitter ( curved ) four - momentum space in the context of dsr , a universal maximal momentum naturally arises in both of these setups through the identification of @xmath34 topology with the space of spatial momenta .",
    "also , it was already pointed out that the phase spaces with compact topology for the momentum part are naturally ultraviolet - regularized @xcite .",
    "this is because a liouville volume associated to a compact phase space is finite and the corresponding hilbert space is finite - dimensional @xcite .",
    "moreover , a measure very similar to ( [ dos ] ) is suggested by the classical limit @xcite of polymer quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , considering the polymerized systems within the boundaries of the standard methods in statistical mechanics is in some sense debatable @xcite .",
    "thus , the density of states ( [ dos ] ) underlies the @xmath35 compact topology and consequently a universal maximal momentum @xmath29 , as an ultraviolet cutoff for the system under consideration , naturally arises in this setup .",
    "this maximal momentum is completely determined by the radius of three - sphere or equivalently by the curvature of de sitter four - momentum space in which three - sphere is embedded .",
    "as we will show in the next sections , existence of a maximal momentum leads to the saturation of thermodynamical properties of the statistical systems at the high temperature regime .",
    "in this section , we ob ain the modified partition function by means of the deformed density of states ( [ dos ] ) in order to study thermodynamics of photon gas in noncommutative spacetime .",
    "the number of accessible microstates for a physical system determines the associated thermodynamical properties in the context of statistical mechanics .",
    "the microstates , however , is determined only by quantum mechanics and there is no classical statistics in essence .",
    "more precisely , for a system at temperature @xmath36 , the quantum partition function for a single - particle state is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the single - particle energy states which are the solution of hamiltonian eigenvalue problem . from the single - particle partition function",
    "one could find the total partition function and all the thermodynamical properties of the system under consideration then could be easily obtained from the total partition function . solving the hamiltonian eigenvalue problem in noncommutative spacetime ,",
    "however , is not an easy task at all due to the complicated form of the representations of the operators in this setup ( see for instance ref .",
    "even if one solves the hamiltonian eigenvalue problem , performing the summation over the microstates energies in relation ( [ qpf ] ) to obtain an analytic expression for the associated quantum partition function may be difficult .",
    "nevertheless , one could approximate the summation over the energies by the integral over the phase space volume by means of the density of states .",
    "the advantage of this method is that , it is not need to solve the hamiltonian eigenvalue problem in noncommutative setup .",
    "indeed , one could work with the hamiltonian function together with the deformed density of states ( [ dos ] ) on the associated noncommutative phase space .",
    "however , one should note that this semiclassical approximation will be coincided with full quantum consideration at high temperature regime and the full quantum considerations then preserve their importance for the low temperature phenomenons such as the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "thus , all the noncommutativity effects are summarized in the deformed density of states ( [ dos ] ) and one could replace the summation over the microstates energies as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spatial volume . using the semiclassical approximation ( [ approx ] ) in the relation ( [ qpf ] ) , the canonical partition function will be @xmath41 for a photon gas confined in a volume @xmath40 at temperature @xmath36 with hamiltonian function @xmath42 , the associated modified partition function for the single - particle state could be easily deduced from the relation ( [ pf - d ] ) as @xmath43 where we have defined @xmath44-\\big[{\\bf l}_1 ( \\kappa{t})+\\kappa{t}\\,{\\bf l}_2(\\kappa{t})\\big]\\bigg\\},\\hspace{.5cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the modified bessel functions and modified struve functions of rank @xmath47 respectively . in the limit of low temperature , the noncommutativity effects will be removed and we find @xmath48 and the relation ( [ pf - d2 ] ) reduces to the standard non - deformed partition function for the photon gas @xmath49",
