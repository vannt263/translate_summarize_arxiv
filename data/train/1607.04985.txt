    "<S> we derive and study a simple 1d nonlinear model for edge localized mode ( elm ) cycles . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear dynamics of a resistive ballooning mode is modeled via a single nonlinear equation of the ginzburg - landau type with a radial frequency - gradient due to a prescribed @xmath0 shear layer of finite extent . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinearity is due to the feedback of the mode on the profile . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a novel mechanism , whereby the elm only crosses the linear stability boundary once , and subsequently _ stays _ in the nonlinear regime for the full duration of the cycles . </S>",
    "<S> this is made possible by the shearing and merging of filaments by the @xmath0 flow , which forces the system to oscillate between a radially - uniform solution and a non - uniform solitary - wave like solution . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts a ` phase - jump ' correlated with the elm bursts .    in magnetically - confined plasmas , edge localized modes ( elms ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are a virulent instability of the plasma , responsible for a significant erosion of the plasma - facing components occurring in the high - confinement ( h - mode ) regime . </S>",
    "<S> although they are beneficial for the expulsion of impurities from the plasma core , for future devices such as iter , they should be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> the present status of the theory of elms is the following : a linear ideal mhd mode is driven unstable by free - energy from the pressure - gradient @xmath1 - and also by edge currents @xmath2 - the peeling - ballooning modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the later evolution is less clear , as it is usually assumed that a certain ` loop ' in the @xmath1 v.s . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 stability diagram occurs , but this is a speculation with no strong foundation . </S>",
    "<S> effects of uniform toroidal flow shear were studied by several authors , see e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and shown to be stabilizing . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there is a large body of experimental evidence and simulations pointing to the non - linear nature of the dynamics of elm cycles and elm burst @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite derived a model extending the linear ideal mhd theory perturbatively to the nonlinear regime , leading to faster - than - exponential growth . </S>",
    "<S> however , their analysis leads to a finite - time singularity , and hence can not explain elm cycles . </S>",
    "<S> single - fluid simulations of electrostatic turbulence showed periodic relaxations of a transport barrier in presence of a prescribed sheared flow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in this letter , we present a low - dimensional model , based on the ginzburg - landau like coupling of an ideal ballooning - type mode to the background pressure gradient , taking into account the effect of a - prescribed - mean sheared flow with finite shear - layer width @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the plasma minor radius . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism we propose is the following : a coherent pressure - driven mode - characterized by filaments along the magnetic field - reaches a saturated state by nonlinear coupling to the pressure profile . in presence of small cross - field turbulent diffusion , </S>",
    "<S> the mean sheared flow destabilizes this saturated state by changing the radial structure of the mode thereby inducing a shearing and merging of filaments , leading to quasi - periodic nonlinear oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the key point is the _ synergy _ between the nonlinearity and the sheared flow . </S>",
    "<S> our proposed mechanism is primarely electrostatic , although electromagnetic effects - observed experimentally - may play a secondary role . </S>",
    "<S> we consider nonlinear heat balance , which can be written : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the laplacian perpendicular to the magnetic - field , with @xmath7 the position of the mode resonance surface . here , the pressure is decomposed into an axisymmetric part @xmath8 and harmonics @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the poloidally and toroidally averaged pressure , and same for the velocity . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic shear </S>",
    "<S> effects - i.e. the fact that modes are localized in the vicinity of a resonance surface - are not taken into account in our model . </S>",
    "<S> some effects of magnetic shear could be assessed in our model in the form of parallel heat diffusion , but this is beyond the scope of this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the aim of this work is to study the basic dynamic process of elm cycles , which can be understood from an electrostatic point of view . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in this simplified model , diamagnetic effects and magnetic fluctuations are not included , and we use the flute approximation @xmath11 - with @xmath12 the wavenumber and @xmath13 the magnetic field . in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hb1],[hb2 ] ) @xmath14 is a cross - field turbulent heat diffusivity , and @xmath15 is an energy source modeling a constant heat - flux from the plasma core . </S>",
    "<S> following the standard convention , @xmath16 represents the local radial coordinate , @xmath17 is the local poloidal coordinate , and @xmath18 is the local toroidal coordinate , in a magnetic fusion device . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath19 denotes the ideal mhd threshold . in order to obtain a transport barrier , </S>",
    "<S> the poloidally and toroidally averaged component @xmath20 is prescribed in the form : @xmath21 corresponding to a shear - layer of finite extent chosen to be centered at @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the maximal shear rate and @xmath24 is the shear - layer width . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath25 is the poloidally and toroidally averaged electric potential . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 sheared flow can be related to toroidal sheared flow via @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the poloidal magnetic field . considering the dominant toroidal harmonic @xmath28 + c.c.$ ] , where @xmath29 is the safety factor at the mode location , we decompose the pressure and radial velocity complex amplitudes in the form @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 denote the radial wavenumber associated to pressure and radial velocity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we may then write the radial velocity as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the cross - phase between radial velocity @xmath35 and pressure @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the ratio of amplitudes .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath38 and a negligeable cross - phase @xmath39 , leading to @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is justified if the correlation - time of the cross - phase is large compared to the characteristic transport time - scale , the relevant regime for a coherent mode which we consider here . </S>",
    "<S> the opposite limit of small correlation - time was investigated recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the following model coupling the complex amplitude @xmath36 to @xmath8 : @xmath41 { \\tilde p}+ { \\chi_{\\rm turb}}\\frac{{\\partial}^2 { \\tilde p}}{{\\partial}x^2 } \\label{harm1 } \\qquad \\\\ \\frac{{\\partial}{\\langle p \\rangle}}{{\\partial}t } & = & { \\chi_{\\rm turb}}\\frac{{\\partial}^2 { \\langle p \\rangle}}{{\\partial}x^2 } - c_{v p } \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x } |\\tilde p|^2+s(x ) \\label{axi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the approximation @xmath42 . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ harm1 ] ) , @xmath43 is the poloidal wavenumber , @xmath44 is the absolute - value of the critical gradient _ in absence of flow - shear _ , related to the ideal mhd threshold . the second term on the r.h.s . of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ axi1 ] ) is due to the convective - flux @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we will freely associate the mode internal energy @xmath46 with the convective heat flux , both being quadratic in the spatial fluctuation fields . </S>",
    "<S> note that a similar assumption was made in the 0d model of ref . . </S>",
    "<S> since we expect the pressure gradient to be limited by the convective flux , we have @xmath47 , i.e. we use the following slaving approximation : @xmath48 . after some algebra , we obtain the following - normalized - ginzburg - landau type of equation : @xmath49 the associated normalized pressure gradient is : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the linear growth - rate , and @xmath52 represents the nonlinear damping . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we take @xmath37 as uniform in the numerical implementation . introducing the characteristic time @xmath53^{-1}$ ] , </S>",
    "<S> time is normalized as @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath55 is a reference pressure . following e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> , space is normalized as @xmath56 , with @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the analog of the ginzburg - landau correlation length is then @xmath58 . the normalized convective flux - the experimentally relevant quantity - is given by : @xmath59    asymptotically far from the flow shear - layer @xmath60 , the system ( [ gl0 ] , [ axi0 ] ) is bi - stable , with the two possible states i and iia given in table [ tab : table1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the saturated state iia , where the pressure profile ` sits ' near the linear threshold @xmath61 is a typical example of self - organized criticality ( soc ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the finite shear - layer width , self - organized criticality _ breaks down _ in the shear - layer , and non - linear oscillations set in . </S>",
    "<S> we solved the nonlinear pde ( [ gl0 ] ) numerically using a finite - difference scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the spatiotemporal dynamics - in presence of a mean sheared flow - of the mode squared amplitude @xmath46 - proportional to the convective energy flux in our model - is shown [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]a ] . </S>",
    "<S> the system exhibits non - linear oscillations _ radially - localized _ near the maximum of the flow - shear . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear oscillations share similarities with elm bursts . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the nonlinear oscillations tends to zero away from the shear - layer of extent @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> radial profiles of the heat - flux , are shown in the initial quiescent period time at @xmath63 , and before a convective - burst at @xmath64 [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]b ] . </S>",
    "<S> the flux profile exhibits a soliton - like negative perturbation ( @xmath64 ) of the reference profile ( @xmath63 ) . </S>",

    "<S> heat flux - in a limited parameter space - shows a decrease of burst frequency with heating power [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]b ] . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency was estimated using a peak - detection algorithm .    to understand the numerical results , </S>",
    "<S> further analytical progress can be obtained by using the ansatz : @xmath66 which yields a system of coupled nonlinear pde s known as likharev equations in the framework of superconductivity [ eqs . </S>",
    "<S> 1a and 1b of ref . ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in contrast to the usual ballooning approximation - we do not assume any a - priori scale separation between the enveloppe @xmath67 and the wavenumber @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> we stress here that keeping all the terms in the expansion is crucial for a nonlinear analysis , otherwise certain invariants of the system are lost . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , rewriting the ginzburg - landau equation in terms of @xmath67 and @xmath68 simplifies the analysis and allows to gain more physical insight .    in a very - wide shear - layer @xmath69 , </S>",
    "<S> the flow - shear is approximately uniform @xmath70 , and the amplitude @xmath67 is approximately uniform @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the radial wavenumber varies linearly with time @xmath72 , this is the usual weak - shear regime . </S>",

    "<S> this allows a non - uniform saturated solution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the three possible states are given in table [ tab : table1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the trivial state @xmath76 , two states are possible , a uniform state and a non - uniform state characterized by a dark soliton , also known as _ caviton _ - since it corresponds to a negative perturbation of the background - of the form : @xmath77 , with @xmath78 a real - valued parameter . </S>",
