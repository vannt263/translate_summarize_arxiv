    "peculiar velocities are deviations from the uniform expansion of the universe . in the standard gravitational - instability paradigm , they are generated by inhomogeneities in the matter distribution .",
    "measurements of peculiar velocities using galaxies rely on distance indicators to subtract the hubble expansion , which limits the volume probed to @xmath3mpc ( see strauss & willick 1995 ; kashlinsky , atrio - barandela & ebeling 2012 for reviews ) . as an alternative ,",
    "kashlinsky & atrio - barandela ( 2000 , hereafter kab ) proposed a method to probe the large - scale velocity field via the dipole induced by anisotropies in the cmb temperature that are caused by the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 , 1972 ) effect in the direction of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the sz has two components : a thermal one ( tsz ) , caused by the thermal motions of electrons in the potential wells of clusters , and a kinematic one ( ksz ) , caused by the motion of the cluster as a whole ( kinematic sz , ksz ; see e.g. the review by birkinshaw 1999 ) .",
    "once it is imprinted on the cmb , the sz distortion remains fixed .",
    "it does not depend on distance , making it a very useful tool to detect clusters at high redshift ( planck collaboration , planck early results xxvi , 2011 ) .",
    "the ksz effect measures motion directly with respect to the cmb frame and does not require subtraction of the hubble expansion .",
    "the kab method evaluates the dipole from an all - sky cmb temperature map at the locations of known x - ray luminous clusters .",
    "since the main contaminant in foreground clean maps is the primary cmb signal , the data need to be filtered to allow the peculiar velocities of clusters to be measured ( haehnelt & tegmark 1996 ) ; kab proposed to use a wiener - type filter for this purpose . in kashlinsky",
    "et al ( 2008 , hereafter kabke , 2009 ) we showed that , within cluster apertures containing zero cmb monopole , a residual cmb dipole exists which is aligned with the cmb dipole .",
    "the amplitude of this residual dipole scales with cluster x - ray luminosity ( kashlinsky et al 2010 ; kashlinsky , atrio - barandela & ebeling 2011 ) proving that the signal is indeed associated with clusters .",
    "we have interpreted this dipole as the signature of a bulk flow .",
    "if the flow extends to the cosmological horizon , part of the all - sky cmb dipole could be viewed as being of primordial , rather than kinematic , origin . as of this writing ,",
    "no alternative interpretations of the signal , which would have been of considerable interest , have been offered in peer - reviewed literature .",
    "our results have been challenged by other authors .",
    "keisler ( 2009 ) , as well as the contemporaneous study by kashlinsky et al ( 2010 ) , noted that the residuals for each of the maps for the eight wmap das ( differential assemblies ) in the kabke measurement are correlated , which increases the errors quoted by kabke , but by no more than @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of das of the wmap dataset .",
    "keisler then claimed that the detection of a large - scale flow was in fact not statistically significant , his error corrections exceeding the @xmath6 factor .",
    "atrio - barandela et al ( 2010 ) pointed out that keisler ( 2009 ) had failed to subtract the dipole of the filtered maps outside the galactic mask , thereby overestimating his error bars .",
    "in addition , we also proved that the filter devised by kab removes the primary cmb down to the fundamental limit of cosmic variance ( atrio - barandela et al 2010 ) .",
    "it was this highly efficient filtering scheme that allowed a detection of the flow at 3.54@xmath7 confidence level , depending on the cluster sample used .",
    "all data needed to verify the measurement have been made publicly available for examination by the interested reader .",
    "osborne et al ( 2011 , omcp ) studied the effect of different filters on bulk - flow measurements from wmap data . in their appendix b.2 omcp reproduced our results at the @xmath8 confidence level but failed to notice that this in itself invalidates the statistical uncertainties claimed by keisler ( 2009 ) .",
    "the lowered significance ( compared to our 3.54 @xmath7 ) , is due to differences in the catalogs used ( kashlinsky et al 2011 ) and to the relatively small number of simulations ( @xmath9 ) carried out by omcp to compute the errors .",
    "omcp also implemented alternative , `` matched '' filters , with which they found no evidence of bulk flows in wmap data .",
    "those matched filters , however , were designed more to detect radio point sources than to remove the primary cmb anisotropies . as a result",
    ", they were insensitive to bulk motions to the extent that the ksz signal is weaker in the filtered maps than in the original data .",
    "as can be seen in omcp s fig .  13 ,",
    "a sample of @xmath10 clusters moving at velocities of @xmath11 km s@xmath1 is required to produce a detectable signal in the filtered maps . at such extreme velocities ,",
    "the motion of individual clusters should be detectable directly in the original cmb maps without any need for filtering .    in another study , mody & hajian ( 2012 , mh ) , using a different wiener filter , concluded that the measured bulk - flow amplitude was  consistent with the @xmath12cdm prediction \" .",
    "this statement ( made prominently in the mh abstract ) is largely meaningless though , since the mh error bars of 1,4002,600 km s@xmath1   per velocity component render their methodology unable to discriminate between the concordance @xmath12cdm prediction and a bulk flow of amplitude 6001,000 km s@xmath1 , as measured by kabke .    in spite of the aforementioned problems with these studies , both the omcp and mh",
    "results have been cited repeatedly as evidence against the existence of a dark flow ( df ) . in this paper , we examine in more detail why the filters used by omcp and mh failed to detect a statistically significant dipole signal .",
    "we stress that our focus is on the dipole signal , _ irrespective of its interpretation_. specifically , we aim to answer the question of why the dipole signal was not detected with the other filtering schemes .",
    "do they reduce the s / n to levels that render the dipole statistically insignificant ?",
    "do they redistribute the dipole signal to lie outside the aperture ranges probed there ? equally important , none of the proposed new filters have been demonstrated to probe the same flow than the kab filter , so the discrepancies between filters could be due to variations of the flow . in this article",
    "we will show that the omcp and mh filters are not as efficient as kab , but that , when correctly implemented , either filter recovers a signal that is in fact compatible with the df identified by us . in sec .",

    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "at the positions of clusters , the microwave temperature anisotropies have four main components : the primary cmb , the tsz and ksz signal , and instrument noise . in foreground",
    "clean maps one needs to expect some level of foreground residuals , but these residuals will not correlate with clusters in the sky and outside the galactic plane are negligible compared with the cosmological signal . the ksz anisotropy is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the projected electron density along the line of sight , @xmath15 the bulk - flow velocity of our cluster sample , @xmath16 the speed of light , and @xmath17 the cmb blackbody temperature .",
    "the bulk flow motion of all clusters in a given sample will generate a cmb dipole at the cluster location that we estimated it to be ( kab ) @xmath18 where the terms on the right - hand side describe the contributions from the ksz , the cosmological cmb , noise , and the tsz , respectively . in this expression , @xmath19 clusters that occupy a solid angle of @xmath20 pixels in the sky .",
    "instrument noise ( the third term ) can be further reduced as @xmath21 by combining @xmath22 differential assemblies operating at different frequency bands .",
    "in addition , the fourth term , reflecting the contribution from the tsz effect , can be isolated and eliminated by using its distinctive frequency dependence . nevertheless , the tsz dipole due to the inhomogeneous distribution of clusters in the sky is bounded above by the tsz monopole . in kashlinsky",
    "et al ( 2008 , 2009 ) we proposed to measure dipoles at zero monopole aperture to limit the tsz dipole contribution even without frequency information .    the largest source of errors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dipole ] ) is the sample - variance uncertainty caused by the small number of pixels at which the dipole is evaluated . to determine peculiar velocities",
    "it is vital to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for these pixels by reducing the contribution from the primary cmb anisotropy .",
    "however , unlike for the tsz component , frequency information can not be used to discriminate between the cmb and ksz contributions to the overall dipole . to address this problem , kab proposed to use the statistical properties of the primary cmb to design a filter that effectively removes its contribution while preserving the ksz component , thereby increasing the s / n of the proposed measurement .    reflecting the spatial isotropy of the cmb temperature anisotropies , filters are spherically symmetric ;",
    "in @xmath23-space , the filter depends on @xmath23 but not on @xmath24 .",

    "the set of clusters in the final sample occupies less than 1% of the sky . in such a small solid angle , spherical harmonics are not orthogonal . before discussing how filters operate , we need to discuss how the dipole power at @xmath36 , that is evaluated only at the cluster positions , is redistributed among all multipoles .",
    "if @xmath37 are the spherical harmonic transforms of the ksz component of the ksz dipole evaluated at @xmath19 locations in the sky then the power at each multipole @xmath23 is @xmath38 .",
    "we define @xmath39 as the contribution of all multipoles @xmath40 to the total dipole in the map as : @xmath41 to predict @xmath42 and @xmath39 we need the electron - density profile of all clusters .",
    "suitable data to derive these profiles accurately are not yet available . to compute the dipole power",
    "we will assume that all clusters subtend the same solid angle and move coherently in the direction @xmath43 .",
    "for simplicity we assign a dipole anisotropy @xmath44k@xmath45 to all pixels of each cluster , where @xmath46 is the angle between the line of sight of the cluster and the apex of the motion . figs .",

    "[ fig : signal]a shows that the lowest multipoles have the largest amplitude , and that power is transferred preferentially to odd multipoles .",
    "[ fig : signal]b shows that less than 10% of the signal remains at @xmath36 ; the bulk of the signal is contained in the range @xmath47 even for unresolved clusters .",
    "the exact distribution of the ksz dipole in @xmath23-space will depend on the ( unknown ) profile of clusters and their extent . since clusters have a radius of 10 - 30 , the effect of the cluster profile will be important for multipoles @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , our conclusion that more than 50% of the ksz dipole signal lies below those scales is not affected by taking a constant profile .",
    "the actual signal will be a combination of the contributions from resolved ( 1530 ) and unresolved ( 10 ) clusters , with clusters of different mass contributing at different relative weights .",
    "the kab filter was specifically designed to remove the primary cmb of the measured cosmological model .",
    "the filter is of the wiener type and was constructed to minimize the contribution from the cosmological signal in the filtered maps in the presence of noise , @xmath49 , i.e.  it minimizes @xmath50 ( kashlinsky et al 2009 ) . in @xmath23-space the filter is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the actual realization of the radiation power spectrum in the sky that includes noise , tsz , ksz , foreground residuals , and primary cmb ; @xmath53 is the power spectrum of the @xmath12cdm model that best fits the data , and @xmath54 is the antenna beam for a given da .",
    "since the quadrupole and octupole are aligned with the dipole , the kab filter is set to zero for @xmath55 to avoid any cross - talk from the corresponding large angular scales that could mimic a dipole . in fig .",
    "[ fig : filters]a we represent the kab filter for the w1 da .",
    "the filter has structure at all multipoles and is therefore sensitive to ksz power across the full multipole range .",
    "omcp used matched filters ( mf ) , i.e. , filters that are suited to distinguish point sources from a background signal , provided the profile of the source is known . in their analysis , omcp assumed that all clusters are unresolved and approximated their profiles by the wmap beam function .",
    "in @xmath23-space this means @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the power spectrum of the tsz effect and of the white and homogeneous instrumental noise , respectively .",
    "@xmath54 is the antenna beam .",
    "in addition , omcp considered clusters to be isothermal , in which case the tsz and ksz profiles are proportional to each other . by measuring the tsz component in the original and in the filtered data",
    ", the fraction of the ksz lost due to filtering could be computed exactly . however , since clusters are _ not _ isothermal ( as demonstrated , e.g. , by atrio - barandela et al .",
    "2008 ) , their electron - density and pressure profiles are in fact different , causing filters that disregard this fact to potentially suppress the ksz signal relative to the tsz contribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : filters]b we plot the omcp filters for eight wmap das , corresponding to the q ( dot - dashed green line ) , v ( dashed blue ) and w ( solid red ) bands .",
    "these filters are effectively band - pass filters , removing all power below @xmath59 and above @xmath60 .",
    "omcp also considered a modified mf , named unbiased multifrequency matched filter ( uf ) , designed to remove the tsz contribution .",
    "since this second filter was found to be even less sensitive to bulk flows than mf , we will not consider it further .",
    "our approach to reducing any tsz contamination will be the same for all filters , namely to compute dipoles at the zero - monopole aperture .",
    "mh used a wiener filter designed to remove the tsz and instrument noise contributions together with the intrinsic cmb , leaving only the ksz component in the data .",

    "[ fig : filters]c we plot the mh filter for assumed cluster extents of 10  and 15 ; both are convolved with the beam of the w1 da .",
    "the filter is normalized to a ksz dipole in the z - direction with an amplitude of @xmath63k ; convolution with the beam reduces the amplitude to @xmath64k .",
    "the resulting two curves can be thought of as two extreme cases of what the actual mh filter might be .",
    "taking into account that very few clusters are resolved in the wmap w band , we will in the subsequent discussion only consider the mh filter constructed assuming an angular radius of 10 .",
    "filtering not only removes the intrinsic cmb component , it also modifies the ksz signal , affecting the cluster extent and its electron density profile . to evaluate the monopole and dipole at @xmath65 cluster positions on the sky we first need to discuss what would be the radial extent of each cluster in the filtered data . in kashlinsky",
    "et al ( 2008 ) we considered that clusters extended 46 times the radial extent of the region emitting 99% the total x - ray flux . since kashlinsky et al .

    "the signal vanishes around 20 , while it extends to 30  for the omcp filters , and well beyond 40  for the mh filter .",
    "these radial extents correspond to unresolved clusters ; for real sources the signal will spread to apertures of even _",
    "larger _ radii .",
    "empirically , we found that the zero monopole aperture was around 25  for the kab filter , whereas slightly above 20  would correspond to all clusters being unresolved by the antenna beam .",
    "the zero monopole defines a physically well motivated aperture over which to compute the dipole .",
    "_ this point was missed by omcp and mh , _ who never have addressed this issue .",
    "the filters discussed in this section are spherically symmetric .",
    "they can not imprint a dipole at zero monopole exclusively at cluster locations on a filtered map but , if not carefully designed and implemented , they can erase it to below the statistically significant level .",
    "omcp implemented two matched filters , named mf , described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : omcp ] , and uf . they measured the dipole at the position of 736 clusters of galaxies and found no significant ksz signal .",
    "omcp tested the performance of their filters using simulated maps and showed that their filters begin to recover the input velocity only at speeds @xmath74 km s@xmath1 for the mf and @xmath75 km s@xmath1 for the uf . the average mean optical depth of the clusters in their sample is quoted as @xmath76 ( sec . 4.5 of omcp ) , and the resulting temperature anisotropy would be @xmath77 . velocities approaching or exceeding 4,000 km s@xmath1  thus induce anisotropies that would be measurable in the original data and for each individual cluster , without any need for filtering .",
    "the root cause of this problem is that omcp s implementation of their filters did not increase the s / n but strongly reduced it , to the extent of rendering their filters unable to detect a cmb dipole corresponding to a bulk - flow velocity of @xmath78 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the poor performance of their filters is also due to the fact that omcp effectively measured the dipole only at the central cluster pixels because their filters were optimized to reconstruct the source amplitude if the source was centered on that pixel ( mak et al 2011 ) . since clusters in the filtered maps reach a zero monopole aperture at @xmath7930 - 40(see fig .",
    "[ fig : filters]d  i ) the implementation by these authors does not use all the information available in the filtered map . also , omcp assumed that the ksz and tsz cluster profiles are identical and unresolved .",
    "however , any filter that efficiently removes the tsz signal will also remove a substantial part of the ksz signal .",
    "this is the reason why the better designed uf requires three times larger velocities than the mf to detect the average motion of @xmath80 clusters .",
    "mh , by contrast , used a different approach . instead of computing the dipole at the locations of clusters , mh fit dipole templates to their filtered maps .",
    "this approach is flawed in two important respects : ( a ) mh require that the total number of clusters , their profiles , and extents be known in advance in order to construct their filter , and ( b ) by matching the same cluster template to the filtered data mh implicitly assume that all clusters have the same profile and extent in the sky as in the filtered cmb data .",
    "hence , changing the profile , number , or extent of clusters changes the filter ( and the filtered map ) and the final results . as both omcp and mh restricted their analyses to apertures smaller than the ones used by kabke",
    ", the dipole measured by us could have remained undetected in the residual cmb and noise of their filtered maps .",
    "to measure the dipole at the locations of clusters in cmb maps filtered following kab , omcp , and mh , our pipeline proceeds as follows :    1 .   for each da ,",
    "the data are multiplied by the extended mask kq75 for the wmap7 data release .",
    "then , monopole , dipole , and quadrupole are subtracted from the regions outside the mask .",

    "notice that each cluster subsample has similar monopoles at 10  for the three filters as expected since our normalization was constructed to produce the same tsz amplitude in the central parts of clusters at 5 .",
    "the errors on the measured dipoles @xmath100 , @xmath101 , were obtained from the dispersion of dipoles measured in random cluster positions in the sky . for each component ,",
    "the error scales approximately as ( atrio - barandela et al 2010 ) @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the rms dispersion of the cmb residual in the filtered map , @xmath104 the dispersion of the noise , @xmath20 the number of pixels occupied by the cluster sample and @xmath22 the number of das used in the analysis . we considered four cluster samples with different numbers of clusters ( 100 , 200 , 400 and 800 clusters ) . for each sample",
    ", we generated 4,000 random cluster distributions .",
    "if clusters sampled the sky homogeneously then the error on the monopole , @xmath105 , and in each dipole component would be related by @xmath106 . for an inhomogeneous cluster distribution",
    "the relation is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the average of the direction cosines of the clusters in the sample ( atrio - barandela et al .",
    "2010 , atrio - barandela 2013 ) .",
    "since the galaxy removes a large fraction of the sky , preferentially in the x direction , errors are larger for @xmath109 than for @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",
    "we verified that this was the case for the three filters , being 10 - 18% and 2 - 3% larger with respect to a homogeneous distribution of clusters for x and y , respectively , and a 15% smaller for z. since the errors are dominated by the residual cmb , they scale as @xmath112 , as dictated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmas ] ) . for each cluster sample ,",
    "the error on each dipole component is scaled by the number of clusters from the error obtained on the simulations .",
    "the errors on the modulus of fig .",
    "[ fig : dipole]d were obtained from the rms dispersion of 10,000 dipoles .",
    "those dipoles were generated by adding to the each measured dipole component a random value drawn from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and dispersion @xmath100 .",
    "the results from the three filters show a reassuring degree of consistency regarding the value of the y - component of the dipole .",
    "this component is always negative for all filters and all cluster configurations , in agreement with the df results , which combine a pronounced negative y - component with a positive z - component of lower amplitude and an x - component that is consistent with zero within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the kab filter ( blue filled circles ) shows a very clear correlation of the y dipole component with the monopole at 10  ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dipole]b ) and so does the overall dipole amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dipole]d ) .",
    "this correlation is found at 30 , when the tsz monopole is zero .",
    "then , there can not be a tsz dipole contribution due to an inhomogeneous cluster distribution .",
    "it is instructive to revisit fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6]a : cluster by cluster , the average temperature anisotropy on a disc of 10  is uncorrelated with the same average over a disc of 30 .",
    "[ fig : dipole]a also shows a strong correlation for x - component in the mh filter ( green triangles ) .",
    "however , in this case we expect this correlation to be due to the tsz effect . as our error analysis show",
    ", the x - component of the dipole is the worst measured since the galaxy is most predominant in this direction .",
    "then , one has to expect an important tsz dipole due to the inhomogeneous distribution of clusters in the sky in agreement with the fact that for the brightest clusters , sample iii , the residual tsz monopole at 30  is @xmath113k , large in comparison with the value of the other two filters ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "it is also in agreement with the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6]c that shows that the average temperature anisotropy at cluster locations within discs of radius 30  ( tsz monopole ) is strongly correlated with the same average at 10  and , consequently , so it would be the tsz dipole at 30 .",
    "we verified that the measured dipoles are in fact very small at the 50  aperture , the zero monopole aperture for this filter .",
    "with respect to the omcp filter ( open red squares ) the dipole is always small and shows no correlation with the monopole at 10 .",
    "the low dipole amplitudes were to be expected since this filter cuts off all the power at multipoles @xmath114 ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : signal]b and fig .",
    "[ fig : filters]b ) and therefore is insensitive to half the dipole signal . at this filter zero monopole aperture ,",
    "@xmath115  the results were not very different , showing no significant dipole either .      since the three cluster samples of table  [ table1 ] are independent the motion of all the clusters can be obtained by averaging the measured dipoles @xmath116 in each sample @xmath117 weighted by their respective errors @xmath118 @xmath119 in table  [ table2 ] we give the resulting dipoles for the three filters .",
    "we also give @xmath105 , the rms dispersion of the monopole .",
    "consistently , the error bars on the dipoles are @xmath120 , being larger for the x and smaller for the z components , as we found with the simulated dipoles ( see sec  [ sec : dipoles ] ) . in the table we also give the dipole amplitude and direction for the three filters .",
    "the errors were computed from the dispersion of 10,000 dipole moduli and directions as in fig  [ fig : dipole]d .",
    "notice the remarkable agreement between the direction of the three filters . the angular separation between the central value of the direction of the kab filter and that of omcp and mh is about 16 .",
    "more remarkable is the close alignment between the direction of the omcp and mh dipoles .",
    "however , the errors on the direction are large and we can not derive a final conclusion of this coincidence since the mh dipoles have probably an important contamination from the tsz monopole , as discussed in sec  [ sec : dipoles ]",
    ".    the results of table  [ table2 ] are crucial to understand the performance of each filter .",
    "of the three filters , the kab filter has the largest s / n . by effectively removing all multipoles with @xmath114 , omcp",
    "filtered maps contain a small fraction of cmb residuals and give the smallest error bars .",
    "unfortunately , the filter is also very effective in removing the dipole signal , degrading the overall s / n .",
    "thus , our results agree with the original omcp analysis since velocities above 4,000km / s were required on samples of @xmath80 clusters for the dipole to be detectable . by comparison ,",
    "the mh filter measures dipoles of larger amplitude but the error bars are also large .",
    "only the kab filter provides statistically significant result . for this cluster sample",
    "our measurement is significant at the 93% confidence level , smaller than in kashlinsky et al ( 2010 ) ( see atrio - barandela et al , 2013 , for a full discussion ) while the results of the omcp and mh have a significance below 60% , reflecting the poor performance of these two filters .      to compare properly the results of the different filters ,",
    "dipoles need to be expressed in velocity and not in temperature units . in kashlinsky",
    "et al ( 2009 ) we denoted the calibration coefficient as : @xmath121 , with @xmath122 the dipole in @xmath86k and @xmath123 the _ filtered _ cluster profile averaged solid angle subtended by the cluster population . for the correct profile",
    ", @xmath124 would be independent of the aperture used to measure the dipole . to account for the dilution effect introduced by the filter",
    "our filtered maps have been renormalized by @xmath87 ( see sec  3.1 ) . in the renormalized maps , @xmath125 . using the @xmath32 model data",
    ", we can compute @xmath85 for our cluster sample for different apertures .",
    "we find that for @xmath126 , the coefficient averaged over the four w das is @xmath127k@xmath128 , respectively . since fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows that at the 10  aperture the three renormalized filtered maps have similar monopoles at the cluster locations , we can assume that @xmath85 is also similar for the three filters out to that aperture .",
    "then , by taking the conversion factor for 10  we can translate the dipole into a velocity @xmath129 with this normalization , the dipole amplitude in km s@xmath1   is lower than the value of @xmath130 km s@xmath1  found previously ( see kashlinsky et al 2009 , 2011 for a full discussion on our previous method ) . nevertheless , our calibration of the flow is still not exact since the @xmath32 model is not an accurate description of cluster profiles outside the x - ray emitting inner part .",
    "the dipole is measured at 30  while @xmath131 is computed at 10 . if @xmath131 is smaller at 30 , as suggested by the calculation at 15 , then the corresponding velocities will be larger .",
    "for instance , if @xmath132k/@xmath133 $ ] then the velocities will be those of our previous work .    even if our calibration of the flow is still uncertain due to lack of proper data , it does not affect the statistical significance of the dipole measured with any of the three filters .",
    "the kab filter does not only measures a dipole that correlates with cluster x - ray luminosity ; it provides the largest signal to noise ratio of the three filters discussed here .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancies between the three filters could be real if the three filters are probing the flow at different scales .",
    "for instance , since the omcp filter is sensitive primarily to scales corresponding to @xmath134 , it gives all the weight to unresolved clusters which are , on average , farther away .",
    "by contrast , the kab dipole includes contributions from nearby systems , owing to the filter s greater sensitivity to low multipoles . while some degree of discrepancy between filters could simply reflect spatial variations in the properties of the flow ,",
    "the fact is that none of the filters but kab has been shown to be limited by cosmic variance , has provided a statistically significant measurement or has shown a correlation with x - ray luminosity at the zero monopole aperture .",
    "therefore , the results obtained using the omcp or mh filters can not be interpreted as ruling out any possible large scale flow detected by the kab filter .",
    "we can now proceed with the summary of the appropriateness of the three filtering schemes in uncovering the ksz - like dipole signal in the kab method .    *",
    "* kab filter*. this filter is the most appropriate of the three as has already been explained in the original kab paper .",
    "it removes the primary cmb down to the fundamental limit imposed by the cosmic variance as demonstrated analytically and numerically in atrio - barandela et al ( 2010 ) .",
    "it has the smallest zero monopole aperture of the three filters and , as fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] shows , at the final - zero monopole - aperture the cmb does not correlate in any meaningful manner with that at the central parts .",
    "this therefore allows to look for the ksz dipole component after the tsz has been made vanishingly small because of the cluster x - ray temperature decrease toward the outer parts ( kashlinsky et al 2009 ) .",
    "the dipole uncovered at cluster positions at such aperture contains a negligible tsz component , which dominates the central parts at @xmath135 .",
    "the filter is sensitive to a ksz dipole spread over the whole @xmath23 space and shows the largest s / n of all the filters anlyzed here . * * omcp filter * is clearly not as efficient as the kab . by cutting power at @xmath114",
    "it reduces the residual cmb that dominates the error bar but also decreases the signal , reducing the overall s / n of the filter .",
    "this point was already demonstrated implicitly in fig .",
    "13 of omcp which shows that no bulk flow can be reliably measured with this filter at velocities @xmath136 km / sec ; we find it strange that , given those numbers , claims are occasionally still made about the alleged efficiency of this filter .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] and table  [ table2 ] demonstrate explicitly that if one uses this filter , particular care must be made to work at the appropriately large apertures of at least @xmath137  in radius .",
    "nevertheless , as the filter is only sensitive to a rather small range of multipoles ( @xmath134 ) , even at these large apertures the signal has been erased as to make the dipole undetectable .",
    "* * mh filter*. this filter is the least useful for the application to the kab method . even at apertures",
    "as large as @xmath137  it still leaves primary cmb and tsz components , as demonstrated by the clear correlation in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6]c , that confuse any determination of the ksz - like dipole signal .",
    "furthermore , the filter does detect a dipole at the 30  aperture , but due to the large monopole residuals , there exists important contributions due to tsz dipoles .",
    "the measured dipoles have the largest error bars and , like in the omcp filter , the results are not statistically significant .    to conclude ,",
    "we have compared the dipoles measured at the locations of x - ray selected galaxy clusters using the filters proposed by omcp and mh with the results obtained with the kab filter .",
    "_ we find that all filters recover dipoles ; the central values of the directions are aligned but the kab dipole is the most efficient since it has the largest statistical significance . _",
    "the discrepancy between these findings of ours and the results published by omcp and mh is due to the latter teams failing to chose the right aperture for their measurement .",
    "in addition , their simulations and calibrations assume the same profile for the electron density and electron pressure , hypothesis that is bound to degrade their filter performances if real clusters are not described by their profiles .    in comparison with the other filters , the kab filter makes no assumptions about cluster profiles or extents , and by design removes the intrinsic cmb , the largest contaminant ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dipole ] ) down to the limits imposed by cosmic variance .",
    "the impact of all uncertainties associated with our limited knowledge of the cluster profile and extent is limited to a single normalization coefficient @xmath131 that does not affect the filter definition .",
    "in addition , the zero - monopole aperture for the kab filter has a radius of @xmath138 , smaller than what is required by the other two filters . finally , the dipole signal recovered with the kab filter is strongly correlated with the central tsz monopole ( or the equivalent x - ray luminosity , kashlinsky et al 2010 ) , a clear indication that the dipole is not produced by some random contribution of the residual cmb .",
    "these three aspects make the kab filter the least affected by possible systematics among the filters suggested to date .",
    "alternative filtering schemes can possibly be designed , but their design must ensure that they increase the s / n of the measurement , not decrease it . finally , filters redistribute the information from real to filtered space by weighing angular scales differently .",
    "therefore , they are probing the velocity field on different scales and the discrepancies on modulus and direction could reflect the spatial variations of the flow . to demonstrate that filters probe the same or different flows would require accurate cluster profiles and it goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "recently , and well after this paper had been submitted to peer - review , the planck collaboration carried out the analysis of the filters described here using the recently released planck data ( planck intermediate result xiii , planck collaboration , 2013 ) .",
    "the ksz team analyzed peculiar velocities using the internal linear combination ( ilc ) map , constructed by combining data at different frequencies with varying weights in @xmath23-space in order to reduce the foreground contribution .",
    "the results found using the kab filter were in agreement with ours but the planck collaboration assigned larger statistical uncertainties , reducing their statistical significance .",
    "the flaws of their analysis , that lead to an overestimation of their errors , are discussed in atrio - barandela ( 2013 ) . also , the ilc data is not the best suited data for this analysis . since the weights of different frequencies vary with @xmath23 , the power of the sz signal is scrambled across different multipoles and makes it very difficult to establish how filters that operate on @xmath23-space transfer the cluster signal .",
    "peculiar velocity measurements will be better studied using planck frequency data .",
    "frequency information will be critical to establish the origin , nature , and scale of the dipole measured in the wmap data .",
    "cluster profiles can be measured individually to determine the effect of filtering on each of the clusters ; the frequency coverage would be crucial to remove any tsz dipole component and , specifically , the 217 ghz channel would be important to test for systematics .",
