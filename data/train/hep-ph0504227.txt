    "to reduce the cosmic - ray muon background , experiments to measure rare processes must be sited underground , where the muon flux is greatly attenuated , and surrounded by an active veto system , to tag the residual muons . even with these standard measures ,",
    "muons are still responsible for significant backgrounds in underground experiments , via the secondary particles created by muon interactions with nuclei .",
    "if the muon interacts inside the detector , the secondary shower particles create unstable isotopes ; some have long lifetimes , making it hard to associate them with particular muons .",

    "these neutrons can then initiate spallation reactions or nuclear recoils inside the detector . while these muon - induced backgrounds are already given serious consideration at present , the next generation of underground neutrino , dark matter , and double - beta decay experiments will require both lower backgrounds and a better quantitative understanding of their characteristics .",
    "fundamental to understanding these backgrounds is the rate and spectrum of muon - induced neutrons  @xcite .",
    "the neutron spectrum is steeply falling over orders of magnitude in neutron energy , but not uniformly so , indicating complexity in its formation .",
    "the total rate of neutron production depends primarily on the soft - neutron spectrum , and has been well measured . in table",

    "the rates at other depths were calculated using the scaling law given by ref .",
    "@xcite ; the result for kamioka is fully consistent with the rate of 2940/ktonday measured by kamland  @xcite .",

    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the production of unstable isotopes as a new and direct probe of the moderate - energy neutron spectrum .",
    "we focus our attention here on the @xmath1 reactions in oil- and water - based detectors , and show that their rates are a sensitive probe of the @xmath0 10100 mev neutron spectrum , which we calculate using fluka .",
    "the predicted rate of @xmath2c@xmath3b production is in very good agreement with the rate measured in the kamland experiment  @xcite .",

    "we make a step towards this goal by focusing on the reactions @xmath2c@xmath3b and @xmath4o@xmath5n in oil- and water - based detectors .",
    "we show below that at depths greater than a few hundred m.w.e . , these are the only significant production channels for @xmath2b in oil - based detectors and @xmath4n in water - based detectors , respectively .",
    "these are among the most significant spallation products in these two important types of detectors . by considering these single isotopes , with the same masses as the parents",
    ", we can isolate just the @xmath1 production channel , and hence directly probe the muon - induced neutron spectrum .",

    "@xcite , and also the average muon energy at a depth of 500m.w.e . ) , 285gev ( the average energy at kamioka ) , 320gev ( the average energy at gran sasso ) , and 350gev ( the average energy at sudbury ) .",
    "the use of the average muon energy should be adequate given that the cross sections for muon - induced processes scale nearly like the energy  @xcite .",
    "only @xmath20 were simulated , though the results ( except for muon capture ) would be very similar for @xmath21 .",
    "the target material in the simulation was the solvent of the liquid scintillator for borexino , trimethylbenzene ( c@xmath22h@xmath23 ) , with density 0.88g/@xmath24 ( incidentally , this makes up 20% of the solvent used in kamland  @xcite ) .",
    "the results should not vary greatly with other organic solvents , given that typical values of the density and mass ratio between carbon and hydrogen are close to those of trimethylbenzene .",
    "additionally , due to the similar relevant properties , the results for water should also be similar .",

    "the relative heights reflect both the particle multiplicities and also how much path length length they accumulate at each energy ( and hence on the mechanisms of energy and particle loss ) .",
    "the calculation includes all real secondary particles in the shower , including the abundant flux of bremsstrahlung photons from the muons .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the usually - defined  range \" of the secondary particles is not directly related to the cumulative path length as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : secondaries_path ] : in fact , the trajectory of each secondary particle is broken in a large number of track segments , each one of them corresponding to the energy of the particle in that track segment ; thus each secondary particle contributes to a large number of bins in the plot , from the initial energy down to lower energies as the particle gets slowed down along its track .    as noted , the neutron secondaries are of special practical importance , and here we focus just on them and the isotopes they produce by @xmath1 reactions",
    ". future studies which consider other produced isotopes will need to consider other secondaries too . in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrons_spectrum ] , we show the energy spectrum of the neutron secondaries . in this range , the neutron spectrum calculated here can be described as a power law @xmath25 over  @xmath010100mev , and a power law @xmath26 over  @xmath01001000mev .",
    "our results are consistent with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , which are also based on a fluka calculation .",
    "while at sea level , the capture of stopped @xmath20 on @xmath2c is the dominant means of producing @xmath2b , this is no longer true more than a few hundred meters underground , due to the steeply falling fraction of stopping muons .",
    "the rate of stopping muons as a function of depths was inferred from the muon flux reported in table  [ tab : muons ] and from the ratio of stopping to throughgoing muons from ref .",
    "@xcite . at the kamioka depth",
    "the expected rate of stopping muons is about 365/ktonday ( this is consistent with the super - kamiokande measurement of 220/ktonday , after taking into account the detection efficiency of 0.65  @xcite ) .",
    "only negative muons can undergo nuclear capture , and the fraction of negative muons is 44%  @xcite .",
    "the fraction of negative muons undergoing capture on @xmath2c in hydrocarbons is 7.7%  @xcite . for muons undergoing",
    "capture , the branching ratio in the channels resulting in production of a bound @xmath2b state is 18.6%  @xcite",
    ". thus the expected production rate of @xmath2b in kamland amounts to 2.3/ktonday .    the expected rate of @xmath2b production by @xmath20 capture at other depths was also calculated similarly , and the results are summarized in table  [ tab:12b - rates ] .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that beyond about 500m.w.e .",
    ", the muon average energy and hence all secondary production rates quoted per meter of muon track , vary only slowly with depth . accordingly",
    ", the focus of this paper is the relative rates of different secondary interactions .    at shallow depths , where the @xmath2c@xmath29 channel is important",
    ", its rate can be very large .",
    "for example , the @xmath2b rate is about 11 hz in the inner 0.680 kton of miniboone ( at sea level ) , where it is a significant background for the supernova detection trigger  @xcite .",
    "to evaluate the contribution from ( @xmath32,@xmath33 ) reactions , we used a technique originally developed to calculate the production rate of the @xmath19c isotope in organic liquid scintillators  @xcite , and recently exploited to calculate the production rate of cosmogenic isotopes in xenon detectors  @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : secondaries_path ] , one of the key results obtained with the fluka calculation is the cumulative path length traveled by secondaries of each type and energy . using this ,",
    "the effects of reactions of the secondaries can be calculated easily , without modifying their transport in fluka , provided that the reactions considered are much less important than the dominant particle stopping reactions .",
    "for example , for  @xmath010100mev neutrons , the ( @xmath32,@xmath33 ) cross sections considered here are @xmath010 mb , much smaller than the total nuclear cross sections of @xmath01b .",
    "cross sections for @xmath2c@xmath3b and @xmath4o@xmath5n as a function of the neutron energy in the lab frame .",
    "data were available up to about 90mev for @xmath2c and 60mev for @xmath4o , beyond which we assumed the cross sections remain constant.,width=312 ]    for a secondary particle of energy @xmath34 , denote the isotope production cross section by @xmath35 , and the appropriate target density by @xmath32 , so that the mean free path is @xmath36^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus given the cumulative path length @xmath15 calculated with fluka , the expected number of interactions of this type at an energy @xmath34 ( and per energy range @xmath37 ) is simply @xmath38/\\lambda(e)$ ] .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the quantity @xmath15 is _ not _ the distance traveled by a secondary of initial energy @xmath34 ; in that case , the dominant stopping reactions would slow the secondary and reduce its interaction rate .",
    "instead , @xmath15 is the total amount of path length accumulated by all secondaries of this type , while they were at the energy @xmath34",
    ".    we will indicate with @xmath39 the total expected number of interactions , and hence the isotope production rate , given in units of per muon track length .",
    "the probability for each secondary to have an interaction in one of the channels of interest and to produce the cosmogenic isotopes under study here is much smaller than unity , given that the cross sections for the processes of interest are negligible with respect to the cross sections of the dominant particle stopping reactions .",
    "therefore we can make the following approximation : @xmath40\\,.\\ ] ] note that the initial secondary particle energy spectrum is not used here directly , but only as an input to the second step of the fluka calculation , which handles all of the particle stopping reactions after having generated the secondaries .",
    "the relative weighting of the integral is most conveniently displayed with the energy on a logarithmic scale , i.e. , in terms of @xmath41 , the shape of this integrand : @xmath42\\,.\\ ] ] in this paper , we consider just the @xmath1 reactions for secondary neutrons .",
    "however , for any secondary particle , any reaction which can be considered as a perturbation to the main particle stopping reactions could be treated very similarly .",
    "returning to the particular case of @xmath2c@xmath3b , the cross section was compiled from a number of references  @xcite and is shown in fig .",

    "<S> while cosmic ray muons themselves are relatively easy to veto in underground detectors , their interactions with nuclei create more insidious backgrounds via : ( i ) the decays of long - lived isotopes produced by muon - induced spallation reactions inside the detector , ( ii ) spallation reactions initiated by fast muon - induced neutrons entering from outside the detector , and ( iii ) nuclear recoils initiated by fast muon - induced neutrons entering from outside the detector . these backgrounds , which are difficult to veto or shield against , are very important for solar , reactor , dark matter , and other underground experiments , especially as increased sensitivity is pursued . </S>",
    "<S> we used fluka to calculate the production rates and spectra of all prominent secondaries produced by cosmic ray muons , in particular focusing on secondary neutrons , due to their importance . </S>",
    "<S> since the neutron spectrum is steeply falling , the total neutron production rate is sensitive just to the relatively soft neutrons , and not to the fast - neutron component . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the neutron spectrum in the range  @xmath010100mev can instead be probed by the @xmath1-induced isotope production rates @xmath2c@xmath3b and @xmath4o@xmath5n in oil- and water - based detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the result for @xmath2b is in good agreement with the recent kamland measurement . besides testing the calculation of muon secondaries , </S>",
    "<S> these results are also of practical importance , since @xmath2b ( @xmath6ms , @xmath7 mev ) and @xmath4n ( @xmath8s , @xmath9 mev ) are among the dominant spallation backgrounds in these detectors . </S>"
