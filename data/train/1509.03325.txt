    "twenty years have passed since the discovery of the heaviest elementary particle , the top quark , at the cdf and d0 tevatron experiments @xcite .",
    "the top quark , being even heavier than the higgs boson recently discovered at the lhc , remains one of the most interesting objects in the elementary particle zoo .    in 1964",
    "gell - mann and zweig @xcite proposed the quark model to explain the experimental observations in accelerator and cosmic ray experiments of many new strongly interacting particles called hadrons .",
    "originally it was enough to introduce only three quarks @xmath10 ( up ) , @xmath11 ( down ) , and @xmath12 ( strange ) to correctly describe the charges and spins of observed hadrons . in this model ,",
    "all the quarks are fermions with spin 1/2 and should have fractional electric charges of 2/3 ( in units of the electron charge ) for the @xmath10-quark and @xmath131/3 for the @xmath11- and @xmath12-quarks .",
    "the proton and the neutron are formed from the quark combinations @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the masses of the quarks are a few mev for @xmath10- and @xmath11- quarks and @xmath16100 mev for the @xmath12-quark , based on measured masses of the proton , neutron , @xmath17 and @xmath18-mesons , and subsequently on deep inelastic scattering measurements . in 1974 a new meson called @xmath19 was observed  @xcite which was quickly interpreted as a bound state of a new quark , @xmath20 ( charm ) , and its antiparticle , with electric charges @xmath21 .",
    "the charm quark had been predicted theoretically to explain the decay properties of charged and neutral @xmath18-mesons through the glashow",
    " iliopoulos  maiani ( gim ) mechanism  @xcite . by that time four electrically and weakly interacting particles ( electron , electron neutrino , muon , and muon neutrino )",
    "were also known , and an interesting symmetric picture appeared containing four quarks , combined into two generations @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and four leptons similarly arrayed in the corresponding @xmath24 and @xmath25 generations . in the mid-1970s",
    "this symmetry was broken when the @xmath26 lepton was discovered  @xcite and a new quark , @xmath27 ( bottom ) , with a mass of about 5 gev and electric charge @xmath131/3 was added to the quark family .",
    "the @xmath27-quark was inferred from the discovery of the @xmath28 meson at fermilab  @xcite at about 10 gev which was seen to be a bound state of @xmath27 and @xmath29 quarks .",
    "subsequent measurements at cornell , desy and slac confirmed this interpretation . if one assumed that the new lepton and quark belong to a third fermion generation , then to recover the quark - lepton symmetry one needed one more quark and one more neutrino to exist .",
    "the new ` top ' quark was discovered in 1995 , and in 2000 the tau neutrino was observed in @xmath26-lepton decays in the fermilab donut experiment .    in the standard model ( sm )",
    "the top quark has the same quantum numbers and interactions as all other up - type quarks .",
    "it is the weak isospin partner of the @xmath27 quark with spin 1/2 and electric charge @xmath30 .",
    "the left chiral part of the top quark is the upper component of the weak isospin doublet and the right chiral component is a weak isospin singlet .",
    "it is a color triplet with respect to the @xmath31 gauge group responsible for the strong interactions in the sm . from the theory side ,",
    "the top quark is absolutely needed to ensure cancellation of the chiral anomaly in the sm and therefore to ensure its consistency as a quantum field theory .",
    "the measured value of the top quark mass at the tevatron and the lhc is now known with a precision better than 0.5% and is the most precisely determined quark mass : @xmath32 gev  @xcite .",
    "it is the heaviest known elementary particle , with a mass slightly less than the mass of the gold nucleus and thus does not conform to the original quark conjecture as a simple constituent of hadrons .",
    "however , up to now we have no indication of any internal top quark structure ; it behaves in all processes as a point - like particle .",
    "two empirical facts distinguish the top from other quarks : its much larger mass and its very small mixing to quarks of the first and second generations .",
    "the natural question arises : why is the top quark so special ?",
    "why is it alone in having a mass of approximately the electroweak symmetry breaking scale ? in the sm",
    "there is no answer to this question .    in another respect",
    "the top quark is a unique object .",
    "the quark mixing in the sm is encoded in matrix elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite .",
    "the matrix element @xmath33 is close to unity while the elements @xmath34 and @xmath35 are significantly smaller than one .",
    "these two experimental facts , large mass and small mixing , lead to the conclusion that in the sm the top quark decays to a @xmath36 boson and @xmath27 quark with a probability close to 100% .",
    "the width of the top is computed in the sm to be about 1.5 gev @xcite , much smaller than its mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the top width is significantly larger than the typical qcd scale @xmath37 mev . as a result ,",
    "the top lifetime ( @xmath38s ) is much smaller than the typical time for formation of qcd bound state hadrons ( @xmath39s ) .",
    "therefore , the top quark decays long before it can hadronize and hence hadrons containing a top quark are not expected to exist @xcite . in this respect",
    "the physics of the top quark is much simpler than , for example , the physics of @xmath40-hadrons , in which bound states of the @xmath27-quark with other quarks and anti - quarks form a rich spectroscopy .",
    "however , since the top quark decays before hadronization its properties are not hidden by hadronization effects , and therefore it provides a very clean source for fundamental information .",
    "in particular , the sm predicts very specific spin correlation properties . due to the ( @xmath41 ) structure of the charged currents in the sm , the top and anti - top spins in production",
    "are strongly correlated and represent a unique experimental probe in the quark sector through the directions of their decay products .",
    "two classes of top quark production exist .",
    "the first proceeds by the strong qcd force in which a quark and anti - quark or a pair of gluons interact to produce a top and anti - top quark .",
    "since each of the produced tops decays to a @xmath36 boson and a @xmath27 quark , the final states are determined by the ways that the @xmath36 bosons decay .",
    "the quarks hadronize in the detector as collimated sprays of hadrons called jets . if both @xmath36 s decay to leptons and neutrinos  ( @xmath42channel ) , the final state has two leptons , two ( @xmath27 ) jets and missing transverse energy ( @xmath43 ) carried by the two neutrinos .",
    "if one @xmath36 decays to a lepton and the other to quark pairs  ( @xmath44channel ) , the final state is one lepton , four jets ( of which two are @xmath27-jets ) and @xmath43 . if both @xmath36 s decay to quarks  ( all - jets channel ) , the final state has six quark jets .",
    "the second production class proceeds through the weak interaction with a @xmath36 boson propagator , leading to a single top quark in the final state , associated with at least one other jet .",
    "the top quark , with its large mass and correspondingly large yukawa coupling @xmath45 close to unity , makes a significant impact on various electroweak observables due to sm quantum loop corrections involving top .",
    "in particular , the loop corrections to @xmath36- and @xmath46-boson masses are proportional to the top mass squared .",
    "the fit of precision electroweak data of lep+sld by sm computations at loop level allowed the indirect estimate of the top quark mass of @xmath47 gev @xcite which was in good agreement with the measurements .",
    "a modern global fit of precision electroweak measurements by quantum loop corrected sm predictions with a significant top - quark input shows how perfectly sm works as a quantum gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the loop contribution involving top quarks is one of the most important factors in the higgs boson self - coupling evolution with energy scale .",
    "it is crucial to know the top quark mass value precisely to understand how stable the sm vacuum is .",
    "the current precision of slightly less than 0.5% seems not yet good enough to get a concrete answer  @xcite .",
    "due to the large top quark mass , the higgs boson mass parameter also gets large loop corrections which depend quadratically on the scale of possible new physics .",
    "such a dependence may lead to the so - called `` little hierarchy problem '' and motivates a possible existence of top quark partners which might be accessible at the lhc .",
    "such partners , if they exist , may give extra loop contributions , thus canceling the strong quadratic behavior and stabilizing the higgs mass parameter .",
    "in the following sections we discuss various aspects of the top quark in more detail : in section  [ history ] , a history of searches for the top quark at cern , desy and kek is given .",
    "the top quark discovery at the fermilab tevatron is described in section  [ discovery ] . in section  [ measurement ]",
    "we present details of measurements of the top pair production cross - section . in section  [ singletop ]",
    "we continue with the discovery of single top production and measurements of the electroweak single top cross - section . due to importance of the top quark mass , its measurement and related problems",
    "are discussed in a special section  [ mass ] . in section  [ properties ] the top quark properties such as spin , charge , lifetime , the ckm matrix element @xmath33 are presented .",
    "the special role of the top quark in the sm , particularly , in assuring the consistency of the higgs mechanism of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking in the sm is discussed in section  [ topforsm ] . in section  [ topforbsm ] the role of the top quark as a possible guide to new physics is reviewed .",
    "a short conclusion is given in the final section .",
    "the quark model discussed in the previous section ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hst01 ] ) and the development of the standard model in the 1970s  @xcite implied the existence of a top quark , the charge + 2/3 partner of the bottom quark .",
    "the search for this new quark was to last for twenty years .",
    "fig / fig1    using the ratios of the already observed quark masses , some physicists suggested that the top quark might be about three times as heavy as the @xmath27 quark , and thus expected that the top would appear as a heavy new meson containing a @xmath48pair , at a mass around 30  gev .",
    "the electron - positron colliders then under construction raced to capture the prize . by 1984 the petra @xmath49 collider at the deutsches elektronen - synchrotron ( desy ) in germany reached a center of mass energy of 46.8  gev and excluded the existence of the top quark with a mass about half of the total center of mass energy or 23.3  gev  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath49 collider tristan with energy of 61.4  gev was built at the high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) in japan in 1986 with the main goal of discovering the top quark . by 1990 experiments at tristan",
    "excluded the top quark with mass less than 30.2  gev  @xcite .",
    "later , the two @xmath49 @xmath46 boson factories slc at slac and lep at cern started operation , and by about 1990 set a lower limit on @xmath50at half of the @xmath46 boson mass , @xmath51  gev  @xcite .    in the early 1980s ,",
    "the sp@xmath52s collider came into operation at cern with counter - rotating beams of protons and antiprotons colliding with an energy of 540 gev ( later upgraded to 630 gev ) . the protons and",
    "antiprotons brought their constituent quarks and antiquarks into collision with typical energies of 50 to 100  gev .",
    "besides the important discoveries of the @xmath36 and @xmath46 bosons , the carriers of the unified electroweak force , the cern experiments demonstrated another aspect of quarks . though quarks had continued to elude direct detection , they can be violently scattered in high energy collisions .",
    "the high energy quarks emerging from the collision region are subject to the strong interaction , creating additional quark - antiquark pairs from the available collision energy .",
    "the quarks and anti - quarks so created combine into ordinary hadrons that are seen in the detectors .",
    "these hadrons tend to cluster along the direction of the original quark , and are thus recorded as a `` jet '' of rather collinear particles .",
    "such quark jets , previously sensed at slac and desy , were clearly observed at cern and became a key ingredient in the next round of the top quark searches .    .",

    "the top quark , as the weak isospin partner of the @xmath27-quark , plays an important role in the sm and in its predictions for experiments . here",
    "we consider briefly several aspects of the role of top quarks : cancellations of chiral anomalies , flavor changing neutral currents and the gim mechanism , the large top yukawa coupling and consistency of the higgs mechanism of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite , and large quantum corrections to electroweak observables .",
    "the top quark is needed for the consistency of the sm as a gauge quantum field theory . in the sm , the fermions , both leptons and quarks ,",
    "are combined into three generations forming left - handed doublets and right - handed singlets with respect to the weak isospin @xmath53 @xmath54 where for any fermion field @xmath55 the left and right chiral components are defined as @xmath56 in order to correctly reproduce the electromagnetic and weak interactions , the gauge group of the electroweak part of the sm is taken as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is called the weak isospin group ( the weak isospin is an analog of the usual isospin introduced by heisenberg to describe the proton and the neutron ) and @xmath59 is the weak hypercharge group .",
    "the hypercharges of the left- and right - handed lepton and quark fields are chosen such that the electric charges are equal to the known measured charges @xmath60 q_f&=&(t^f_3)_r + \\frac{\\displaystyle y^f_r}{\\displaystyle 2}\\\\ \\end{array } \\label{11_55}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 are the isospin projections @xmath62 for the up - type component and @xmath63 for the down - type component of the fermions , @xmath64 stands for corresponding weak hypercharges of the fermions .",
    "these relations are known as the gell mann ",
    "nishijima formulas .",
    "the relations for the group generators guarantee that after the spontaneous symmetry breaking , the gauge symmetry @xmath65 reduces to the unbroken electromagnetic group @xmath66 .",
    "because of this chiral structure of the sm , there is a potential  chiral \" anomaly problem .",
    "generically , anomalies in a field theory correspond to the situation where some symmetry is present at the level of a classical lagrangian but is violated at the quantum loop level .",
    "indeed , after a quantization of the sm one finds that the left- and right - handed fermion currents , conserved in accord with noether theorem at the classical level , are not conserved for individual leptons or quarks at quantum level due to the triangle loop contributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fa1 ] .",
    "are 4-momenta and @xmath67 are a generic notation for the gauge group generator in the interaction vertex of corresponding gauge boson with the fermion in the loop . ]",
    "if an anomaly does not vanish , the theory loses its gauge invariance and therefore can not be acceptable .",
    "( however , in the case of anomaly free fundamental theories such as qed one may consider some currents , for example pseudoscalar fermion pair currents , that respect some global symmetry at the classical level in addition to the local gauge symmetries of the fundamental theory .",
    "anomalies for such currents do not lead to problems .",
    "moreover , this type of anomaly may have very important physics consequences , as in the case of @xmath68 decay to two photons . ) in the sm there are simultaneous contributions from left and right chiral fermions which contribute to the anomaly with opposite signs .",
    "the anomaly is then proportional to the differences between traces of group generators coming from fermions with left and right chiralities : @xmath69_l -    \\mbox{tr}\\left [ t^a\\{t^b t^c\\ } \\right]_r , \\label{a5}\\ ] ] where the square and the curly brackets denote commutators and anticommutators respectively .    in theories like qed or qcd",
    "there are no @xmath70 matrices in the lagrangians .",
    "therefore the left and right chiral contributions exactly compensate each other , so the anomaly is equal to zero and the theories make perfect sense .    in the electroweak part of the sm , left- and right - handed states couple to @xmath59 gauge bosons with different hypercharges , and only the left components couple to the @xmath58 gauge bosons .",
    "so , it is not obvious _ a priori _ that the chiral anomalies vanish . but the absence of anomalies is a requirement for the sm to be a valid quantum theory .    without going into details ( they can be found in textbooks , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) one can check that all the chiral anomalies are canceled in the sm for each fermion generation due to the simultaneous contributions of quarks and leptons with left and right chiralities . in particular , the cancellation of the anomaly in each generation takes place due to the sum of electric charges of leptons being equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the sum of quark charges .",
    "for such a cancellation , the number of colors ( @xmath71 ) must be equal to three .",
    "in particular , the cancellation for the third generation requires a top quark with charge @xmath72 , giving @xmath73 .",
    "the basic principle in constructing the sm lagrangian is gauge invariance , which allows us to consider only two types of gauge invariant terms containing quark - higgs yukawa interactions with mixing of the down- and up - type quark fields from different generations : @xmath74 where @xmath75 are generic mixing coefficients , @xmath76 with the symbol (  ) used to account for quark states before rotation to the mass eigenstates , and the higgs @xmath77 and conjugated higgs @xmath78 fields in the unitary gauge have the forms    @xmath79 , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 = 246 gev is the vacuum expectation value and @xmath82 is the scalar higgs boson .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking the lagrangian ( [ q - h - lagr ] ) takes the form @xmath83 ( 1 + h / v)\\ ] ] where @xmath84 are mass mixing matrices for down- and up - type quarks .",
    "the matrices should be diagonalized to get the physical states for up- and down - type quarks .",
    "this can be done using unitary transformations in flavor space for all types of up and down , left and right quark fields @xmath85 after such transformations the above yukawa lagrangian contains dirac mass terms for quarks and their interactions with the higgs boson are proportional to the fermion masses : @xmath86 \\left(1+\\frac{h}{v}\\right ) , \\label{mass - terms}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 stands for three flavor generations , and in particular , @xmath88 is the top quark mass @xmath50 .",
    "recall that in the sm all fermion interactions with vector gauge fields follow from the gauge invariance principle and are expressed in terms of the products of the gauge fields to neutral and charge currents containing fermions from the same generation .",
    "therefore the above unitary transformations ( @xmath89 ) do not affect the neutral currents . as a result",
    "there are no flavor changing neutral currents in the sm at lowest order",
    ".    however , the charge currents @xmath90 contain quarks rotated by different unitary matrices for the up- and down - type quarks @xmath91 therefore after the unitary transformation the charge current becomes : @xmath92 the unitary matrix @xmath93 is called cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix  @xcite : @xmath94 the ckm matrix is unitary since it is constructed from the product of unitary matrices .",
    "however this is true only because of the presence of the top quark in the third generation .",
    "the unitarity leads to various constraints on the elements of the ckm matrix such as @xmath95    one of the consequences of such unitary constraints is the gim mechanism , formulated originally for the case of two generations @xcite but with obvious extension to three generations .",
    "the gim mechanism allows one to understand flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) suppression at higher orders of perturbation theory in the sm .",
    "as explained above , the fcnc are absent in the sm at the lowest order by construction .",
    "however , at higher orders the fcnc appear in the case of two ( real or virtual ) @xmath96 and @xmath97 emissions by the quark current .",
    "for example , the fcnc @xmath98 transition is proportional to @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the propagator of the corresponding up - type quark with a momentum @xmath101 . in the case of equal quark masses",
    "one would have the factor @xmath102 in front of the current , which is equal to zero due to the unitary constraint .",
    "this is the exact gim cancellation .",
    "if quark masses are not equal , as happens in nature , the fcnc will be non - zero and will give well defined predictions for various phenomena in physics of kaons , @xmath103 and @xmath40 mesons such as oscillations , rare decays , etc .",
    "an example is the rare decay of the @xmath104 meson to a muon pair @xmath105 .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=37.0% ] .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=33.5% ]    due to absence of the fcnc at tree level the leading feynman diagrams are the loop diagrams , called box and penguin , as shown in fig.[bs - decay ] . in this case",
    "the diagrams involving virtual top quark dominate and lead to a theoretical decay rate in the sm of @xmath106 @xcite , in good agreement with measured values by the lhcb @xcite and the cms @xcite experiments .",
    "we stress that the gim mechanism works for three fermion generations only because of existence of the top quark .      as follows from the lagrangian ( [ mass - terms ] ) , the yukawa top - higgs interaction is proportional to the top quark mass @xmath107 and therefore it is strong since the top quark mass is large .",
    "the top yukawa coupling @xmath108 is numerically close to unity .",
    "such a large top yukawa coupling makes a significant impact on the higgs potential when higher order corrections are considered .    in the sm , as for any quantum field theory , all the masses and coupling constants get quantum corrections and become so - called running masses and running coupling constants . in particular , the higgs boson self - interaction quartic coupling @xmath109 gets loop corrections coming from the top , higgs and electroweak gauge boson loops . as a result of the renormalization group evolution , @xmath109 becomes a function of the energy scale ( renormalization scale @xmath110 ) .",
    "the analyses of the running coupling are performed at nnlo accuracy @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "because of the running of the higgs self - coupling , the behavior of the higgs potential may be changed drastically at high energy scales . since the effective higgs potential is proportional to @xmath111 at large @xmath110 or equivalently at large value of the higgs field , different situations may occur",
    ". the quartic coupling @xmath111 may be positive all the way up to the planck scale leading to an absolutely stable theory .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath111 may become negative at large @xmath110 , leading to a potential that falls with @xmath110 leading to instability of the theory . or @xmath111 may take such values that a second minimum of the potential appears at some particular scale , leading to metastability due to possible tunneling effects .",
    "the second minimum takes place at some scale @xmath112 where the derivative of @xmath111 , or equivalently the @xmath113 function , is zero @xmath114 if the value of the potential at the new minimum @xmath112 is less than the value of the vacuum potential at the electroweak scale then the theory is metastable .",
    "the boundary between stable and meta - stable cases corresponds to a situation where the first and second minima of the potential are equal .",
    "the minimum can always be chosen to be zero by a constant shift of the potential .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition @xmath115 at some scale called the critical point @xmath116 .",
    "because the largest loop corrections in the evolution of @xmath111 are proportional to various powers of the top yukawa coupling @xmath117 , the accuracy of the top quark mass measurement is of special importance .",
    "results of the nnlo analysis are shown in fig.[higgs - self - coupling ] @xcite .",
    "as one can see , given the uncertainties , the second minimum and critical point could be achieved at the planck scale .",
    "however , a top quark mass of about @xmath118 gev is needed for this to occur . if the top quark mass is heavier , the quartic coupling crosses zero at lower @xmath110 .",
    "in particular , the value of the top quark mass close to the current measured value @xmath119 gev leads to the scale @xmath120 gev for which the quartic coupling becomes negative .",
    "@xmath121{fig / fig19}\\ ] ]    keeping in mind the relation between the higgs mass and the quartic coupling @xmath122 , a bound is obtained for the higgs mass , assuming the critical point to be the planck scale @xcite @xmath123 > 129.4 + 1.4 \\left ( \\frac{m_t~[{\\rm gev } ] -173.1}{0.7 } \\right ) -0.5\\left ( \\frac{\\alpha_s(m_z)-0.1184}{0.0007}\\right ) \\pm",

    "if one combines in quadrature the theoretical uncertainty and the experimental uncertainties on @xmath50 and @xmath127 one gets @xmath128 gev .",
    "therefore the conclusion from this analysis is that the stability of the sm vacuum up to the planck scale is excluded for @xmath129 gev at 98% cl .",

    "@xmath131    the exclusion of the sm as a valid quantum theory up to the planck scale is only at the 2 sigma level with today s measured top quark and higgs boson masses , so one can not fully reject the hypothesis that the sm works all the way up to the planck scale .",
    "this allows one to consider scenarios with the sm higgs acting as an inflaton @xcite .",
    "clearly , a better precision of the top quark mass is needed as may be achieved at the lhc , but certainly at a future @xmath49 collider .",
    "as the precision of the top quark mass measurement becomes substantially smaller than 1  gev , it will become imperative that the measured mass has a well defined theoretical meaning ( see section  [ mass ] ) .",
    "also , to discriminate between stability , metastability or criticality of the electroweak vacuum , a contribution from possible `` new physics '' might be very essential @xcite .",
    "a large top mass and correspondingly large top yukawa coupling lead to a potential problem of the sm called `` naturalness '' or the `` hierarchy '' problem .",

    "give the following leading expression @xmath132 where the cutoff parameter @xmath133 represents the possible `` new physics '' scale .",
    "the main contribution to the correction comes from the top quark loop .",
    "the problem is that the correction depends very strongly ( quadratically ) on the scale @xmath133 which may be related to contributions from `` new physics '' .",
    "if @xmath133 is very large , ( e.g. the planck scale or even @xmath134 gev ) , the higgs mass of the order of 100 gev is very unnatural .",
    "such a dependence is a specific property of the scalar higgs boson .",
    "quadratic scale dependences for other sm particles are protected by a symmetry  gauge symmetry for the gauge bosons and chiral symmetry for fermions , but there is no such sm symmetry protecting higgs quadratic dependence .",
    "if one requires the correction to the higgs mass to be less than the higgs mass itself , @xmath135 , one finds the upper limit on the scale @xmath133 to be slightly less than 1 tev ( the `` little hierarchy '' problem ) .",
    "no new physics particles at this mass scale have been found yet .",
    "but since the main contribution to the higgs mass correction comes from the top loop , one might expect the existence of some rather light top - quark partners , such as stop quarks in supersymmetric models , giving additional loop contributions which may cancel the top loop quadratic behavior on @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "because of the large top quark mass , one naively would think that the loop contributions from such a heavy particle would be suppressed .",
