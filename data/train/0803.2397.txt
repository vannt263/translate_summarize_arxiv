    "central to the study of galaxy evolution is the formation and evolution of the supermassive black holes in their nuclei .",
    "accretion onto these black holes can provide the energy source for active galactic nuclei , which in turn impact the evolution of galaxies ( silk 2005 ) .",
    "the processes believed to play a role in the formation of seed black holes , from which large black holes may form through accretion , involve 1 ) dynamical friction and collision processes in dense young stellar clusters ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "2004 ) ; 2 ) seeds as the remnants of popiii stars ( e.g. , bromm et al .  1999 , abel et al .",
    "2000 , yoshida et al .",
    "2003 ) ; 3 ) accretion of low angular momentum material and gravitational instability in primordial disks ( e.g. , koushiappas , bullock & dekel 2004 ; lodato & natarajan 2007 ) ; and 4 ) the ( singular ) collapse of massive pre - galactic halos ( bromm & loeb 2003 ; spaans & silk 2006 ) .",
    "the growth of these seed black holes to larger sizes involves accretion that roughly follows an eddington rate and requires the incorporation of feedback effects ( silk & rees 1998 , wyithe & loeb 2003 , di matteo , springel & hernquist 2005 ) .",
    "see pelupessy , di matteo & ciardi ( 2007 ) for an asessment on the difficulties that seed black holes have to grow at the eddingtion rate .",
    "understanding the growth of these black holes is also important because there appears to be a scaling relation between bulge and black hole mass , with about @xmath10 of the bulge mass tied up in the central black holes ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 , hring & rix 2004 ) . in this work",
    ", it is investigated how one can observe a population of these putative black holes in the early universe , at redshifts @xmath11 , through high temperature molecular lines that are driven by x - rays and that are accessible to the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , which covers the 300 @xmath12 m to 3 mm wavelength range .",
    "we consider a high redshift halo which already contains , by assumption , a seed black hole .",
    "suppose further that an initially metal - free hydrogen gas is cooled by lyman @xmath13 to @xmath14 k and settles in the center of a halo close to the black hole .",
    "part of the gas is likely to experience a period of popiii star formation .",
    "if popiii star formation occurs , then the short life times of primordial stars ensure that the accreted gas is quickly polluted by a modest amount of dust and metals .",
    "if no star formation takes place , then the gas will remain metal - free . in either case",
    ", the accretion process will lead to the emission of x - rays that impact the thermal , ionization an chemical balance of the gas in the halo , leading to an x - ray dominated region ( xdr , maloney et al .",
    "1996 ; meijerink & spaans 2005 ) . for simplicity the black hole is taken to radiate at the eddington luminosity .    for a baryonic number density @xmath15 @xmath16 today , hydrogen mass @xmath17 , halo masses of @xmath18 @xmath1 and a characteristic size scale of @xmath19 , one has a typical mean density and column of @xmath20 ^ 3 $ ] @xmath16 and @xmath21 ^ 2(m_h/10 ^ 9m_\\odot)^{1/3}$ ] @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the work of mo , mao & white ( 1988 ) shows that the subsequent formation of a disk occurs , with a collapse factor of @xmath23 .",
    "this yields densities that exceed @xmath24 @xmath16 within 1 kpc .",
    "the above cosmology provides the boundary conditions for the ambient density and column density of individual models , and the metallicity is put in by hand .",
    "the models of meijerink & spaans ( 2005 ) and meijerink et al .",
    "( 2007 ) are used to compute the thermal , chemical and ionization balance of the irradiated gas self - consistently , for one - dimensional constant density slabs of gas .",
    "the multi - zone escape probability method of poelman & spaans ( 2005 , 2006 ) has been used to compute the line intensities presented here .",

    "( 2007 , their table 1 ) is adopted , which is 1 pc in size .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the cited papers for a detailed description of all physical processes involved .",
    "there are four free parameters in the models : hydrogen density , hydrogen column density , metallicity and x - ray flux .",
    "the latter parameterizes unknowns like the accretion rate , turbulent viscosity and the spectral shape of the x - ray radiation . for definiteness , a power law radiation field with @xmath25 is adopted for energies @xmath26 between 1 and 100 kev , appropriate for a self - absorbed seyfert nucleus .",
    "this slope , if it is between @xmath27 and @xmath28 does not significantly impact the chemistries of h@xmath2 , co and h@xmath7 ; see also meijerink & spaans ( 2005 ) for the case of a 1 kev thermal spectrum . solar elemental abundance ratios are adopted . as long as [ o",

    "chemical equilibrium is assumed . at densities of @xmath30 @xmath16 and for high x - ray fluxes ,",
    "collisional and radiative time scales are short compared to the free - fall time .",
    "the chemical network comprises a few thousand reactions between 154 species with sizes up to 4 atoms ( woodall et al .",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and small grains are included in the charge balance and are assumed to scale with the elemental carbon abundance .    following the above cosmology",
    ", we consider column densities of @xmath31 @xmath22 and densities of @xmath32 @xmath16 .",
    "the x - ray flux takes values of @xmath33 erg s@xmath34 @xmath22 .",
    "results are shown in the figures 1 , 2 and 3 for a density of @xmath35 @xmath16 .",
    "values below this density but above @xmath36 @xmath16 were found to lead to similar signal strengths for h@xmath2 and h@xmath7 . for co ,",
    "line intensities smaller by a factor of @xmath37 were found .",
    "recall that the eddington luminosity is @xmath38 erg s@xmath34 .",
    "so @xmath39 erg s@xmath34 @xmath22 corresponds to a @xmath40 @xmath1 black hole that emits @xmath41 erg s@xmath34 through a surface with a radius of about 100 pc .",
    "the level to which popiii star formation pollutes the center of the primodial galaxy with metals through supernova explosions is a free parameter .",
    "metallicities between @xmath10 and 1.0 solar are considered since @xmath10 solar is quite like a zero - metallicity gas as far as h@xmath2 and co are concerned , and supersolar values appear unlikely for the bulk of the very high redshift gas .",
    "dust grains , with standard milky way properties ( mathis et al .  1977 ) , are included and their abundance is assumed to scale with the overall metallicity . the velocity dispersion of the gas has a thermal contribution , equal to @xmath42 km / s , and a turbulent contribution , equal to @xmath43 km / s , for individual gas clouds on the scale of 1 pc . in the dense gas considered here , turbulence is expected to be maintained at a level similar to that in active galaxies .",
    "the main goal is to compute the expected columns of h@xmath2 , co and h@xmath7 , and their associated emission strengths . for simplicity ,",
    "a fiducial column of @xmath44 @xmath22 is adopted for the predicted line emissivities .",
    "this is driven by the theoretical considerations above , but also by recent observations of massive galaxies at @xmath45 ( daddi et al .  2007a , b ) .",
    "a significant fraction ( 20 - 30% ) of the systems appear to contain heavily obscured agn with columns in excess of @xmath46 @xmath22 .",
    "these massive systems appear to be a somewhat later stage of the concurrent bulge - black hole mass forming systems studied here .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of these lower redshift counterparts is @xmath47 erg s@xmath34 in the 2 - 8 kev band .",
    "the precise value of the total obscuring hydrogen column does not impact our emissivity results as long as it exceeds @xmath48 @xmath22 , i.e. , includes all @xmath49 k gas .      in the absence of dust grains , h@xmath2 is formed in the gas phase through the h@xmath50 route , h@xmath50+h@xmath8h@xmath2+e@xmath50 .",
    "this leads to high abundances of h@xmath2 , @xmath51 , even for low metallicities ( figure 1 ) .",
    "so , contrary to far - ultraviolet ( fuv , 6 - 13.6 ev ) illumination , x - ray irradiation constitutes a form of positive feedback for h@xmath2 ( haiman et al .",
    "the models with a modest metallicity of @xmath52 , and thus dust grains , follow the h@xmath2 formation prescription as in cazaux & spaans ( 2004 ) , which includes both physisorbed and chemisorbed hydrogen atoms .",
    "the columns of h@xmath2 that are reached at low metallicities are as large as @xmath48 @xmath22 .",
    "this while temperatures exceed 100 k over the bulk of this column , and reach @xmath36 k at its edge , sufficient to excite the @xmath53 k s(0 ) line at 28 @xmath12 m and @xmath54 k s(1 ) line at 17 @xmath12 m .",
    "the s(1 ) line is typically weaker than the s(0 ) line , while both lines are optically thin and in lte .",
    "high molecular gas temperatures are reached in xdrs because of efficient ionization and coulomb heating , rather than photo - electric heating from dust grains ( meijerink & spaans 2005 ) .",
    "interestingly , an increase in metallicity decreases the h@xmath2 line strength .",
    "this is a direct consequence of enhanced cooling in fine - structure lines and a lower resulting temperature .",
    "hence , the pure rotational h@xmath2 lines are particularly well suited to detect the earliest stages of black hole accretion , prior to significant metal pollution by star formation .",
    "metallicities below @xmath10 were found to lead to quite similar h@xmath2 emissivities since all h@xmath2 is formed in the gas phase and fine - structure cooling is modest .",
    "figure 2 ( see section 4 for its details ) shows rest frame line intensities of @xmath55 erg s@xmath34 @xmath22 sr@xmath34 at a metallicity of @xmath10 solar . for the numbers below",
    ", the alma sensitivity tool on the eso website has been used and the concordance model , with the latest wmap3 results , is adopted . with a source size of @xmath56 , or 600 pc at @xmath57 , this yields a s(0 ) flux density of @xmath58 jy , for a fiducial galaxy center velocity dispersion of 20 km / s ( @xmath59 pc from a @xmath60 central mass ) .",
    "for the s(0 ) line from @xmath57 , so at 0.45 mm , and for 10 km / s spectral resolution , this is detectable with alma ( 50 antennas , beam size = source size ) at the @xmath61 level in 4 hours of integration .",
    "hence , despite the fact that the line falls in the less sensitive band 9 , spectrally resolved detection is possible .",
    "the pure rotational h@xmath2 lines are intrinsically very bright , because of the strong contribution from the x - ray driven h@xmath50 route , and are accessible to alma for redshifts above 10 , for s(0 ) 28 @xmath12 m , and above 16 for s(1 ) 17 @xmath12 m .",
    "figure 1 , for a density of @xmath35 @xmath16 , shows that the h@xmath7 abundance increases with ionization parameter @xmath62 for metallicities below @xmath63 of solar .",
    "a higher x - ray ionization rate leads to a larger h@xmath7 abundance , through h@xmath2 secondary ionizations , and boosts the formation rate h@xmath2+h@xmath64@xmath8h@xmath7 .",
    "the h@xmath2 abundance is thus key since no h@xmath7 can be formed without it .",
    "too large values of @xmath62 lead to a decrease in the h@xmath7 abundance , driven by dissociative recombination .",
    "the best candidate for an h@xmath7 detection is the optically thin ( 2,2)@xmath8(1,1 ) line at 95 @xmath12 m , as suggested by pan & oka ( 1986 ) .",
    "the critical density of the ( 2,2)@xmath8(1,1 ) transition is about @xmath65 @xmath16 and the excitation energy @xmath66 k. collisions between h@xmath7 and electrons have been included in the non - thermal rotational excitation of h@xmath7 ( faure et al .",
    "2006 ) . in all , figure 2 shows that one reaches a maximum rest frame intensity of @xmath67 erg s@xmath34 @xmath22 sr@xmath34 , at low metallicity and strong x - ray irradiation , with typical abundances of @xmath68 . with a source size of @xmath69 , or about 1.8 kpc at @xmath70 ,",
    "this yields a flux density of @xmath71 mjy , for a fiducial galaxy center velocity dispersion of 20 km / s .",
    "for @xmath72 at 1 mm ( from 95 @xmath12 m ) , this is barely detectable with alma at the @xmath73 level , in 48 hours of integration ( 50 antennas , beam size = source size ) , and only if the line is unresolved .",
    "[ [ co ] ] co ~~    any metallicity larger than @xmath10 solar leads to significant , @xmath74 , abundances of co. x - rays , because of their large energy , do not dissociate co directly .",
    "fuv photons are produced through collisional excitation of h and h@xmath2 by electrons , followed by radiative decay .",
    "this uv flux is generally modest and thus co can survive even in strong x - ray radiation fields .",
    "given the high molecular gas temperatures in xdrs , @xmath75 k , rotational levels with @xmath76 are excited ( meijerink et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "this very high @xmath77 co emission requires densities @xmath78 @xmath16 because the critical densities of these lines are about @xmath40 @xmath16 .",
    "metallicities in excess of @xmath63 of solar further raise the co emissivities , even though the higher abundances of c , o , si and fe also enhance the cooling of the gas ( santoro & shull 2006 ) .",
    "the co emissivities below @xmath10 solar are negligible .",
    "one finds from figure 2 that , at a metallicity @xmath79 solar , rest frame co line intensities reach @xmath4 erg @xmath22 s@xmath34 sr@xmath34 , which yields a flux density of @xmath80 jy for a @xmath56 source size , or 850 pc at @xmath72 , and a fiducial galaxy center velocity dispersion of 20 km / s . for the rest frame peak in the co line spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at 3000 ghz ( see figure 2 ) , 10 km / s velocity resolution and for @xmath72 , alma detects such a source at @xmath81 in 8 hours of integration ( 50 antennas , beam size = source size ) .",
    "spectrally resolved detection is possible .",
    "alma covers 0.3 to 3.0 mm , fortuitously matching most of the x - ray driven co line sed for @xmath11 .",
    "figure 2 shows how the rest frame spectral line distribution of co , pure rotational h@xmath2 and h@xmath7 evolves with irradiation and metallicity for an alma beam that is filled with 1 pc clouds at @xmath30 @xmath16 .",
    "these clouds are in keplerian orbit around the central black hole and are randomly distributed over a spherical region with a linear size of 1 kpc in such a way that there is about one cloud along each line of sight .",
    "this central region is slowly enriched in metals as indicated .",
    "the total column density is on average @xmath82 @xmath22 along each line of sight .",
    "the total intensity is then found by a ray - trace on the level populations of the individual clouds .",
    "more complicated geometries are not an issue as long as the cloud covering factor is of the order of unity and the bulk of the emitted x - rays are absorbed .",
    "overall , x - ray fluxes of @xmath29 erg s@xmath34 @xmath22 , corresponding to black hole masses of @xmath83 @xmath1 and a region with a size of @xmath84 pc yield detectable lines , provided the black hole is radiating at its eddington luminosity .",
    "this mass value is comparable to that of black holes present in in cosmological simulations of @xmath85 halos collapsing at @xmath86 ( peluppessy et al .",
    "black holes that are emitting below the eddington luminosity by a factor of @xmath87 are detectable with alma only if their masses exceed @xmath88 @xmath1 .",
    "also , the eddington time of @xmath89 yr is 25% of the hubble time at @xmath72 , yielding a fair probability for detection of these systems in the alma frequency window .",
    "finding sources is best done in the continuum ( e.g.  the james webb space telescope ) , with alma follow - up . since the molecular lines are optically thin , they trace the kinematics of all irradiated gas .",
    "multiple co and h@xmath2 lines further allow one to determine the ambient density , temperature and x - ray flux .",
    "[ oi ] 63 @xmath12 m and [ cii ] 158 @xmath12 m fine - structure lines can be important coolants of x - ray irradiated gas as well . at a metallicity of @xmath5 , fine - structure line cooling contributes about half of the total cooling .",
    "these lines could also be observed with alma , but fuv or cosmic ray irradiation boosts them as well ( meijerink et al .",
    "2007 ) , diminishing their diagnostic value for tracing black hole accretion .",
    "in addition , the 149 @xmath12 m ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) rotational line of heh@xmath92 is shown in figure 2 , because it was suggested by maloney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as a useful xdr tracer .",
    "it is found that this line is typically much weaker than the h@xmath2 and co lines , and heh@xmath92 abundances do not exceed @xmath93 .",
    "fast ( @xmath94 km / s ) shocks can lead to similar co and h@xmath2 emissivities , albeit over much smaller regions so that beam dilution would be an issue .",
    "also , shocks should produce co line profiles with strong non - gaussian wings . at redshifts of a few ,",
    "co emission with upper levels @xmath95 from massive tori in active galaxies is also accessible to alma .",
    "this has been studied by kawakatu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the case where fuv photons drive the chemistry .",
    "narayanan et al .  ( 2008a ) look at simulations of @xmath96 quasars in @xmath97 @xmath1 halos and find that the co is highly excited by starbursts , peaking at @xmath98 .",
    "narayanan et al .  ( 2008b ) further find that agn - driven winds may leave signatures in the co line emission profile in the form of high velocity peaks at a few times the circular velocity .",
    "also , lintott & viti ( 2006 ) and meijerink et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find an increase in hcn emission with x - ray flux , but this effect is suppressed at low metallicity and for densities @xmath99 @xmath16 .",
    "the x - ray driven lines presented here complement these efforts .",
    "finally , figure 3 shows a co comparison between an agn ( xdr ) and a starburst ( pdr = photon dominated region ) model , for the same impinging flux by energy of 100 erg s@xmath34 @xmath22 , typical of a @xmath100 erg s@xmath34 seyfert nucleus or @xmath40 b0 stars within a 200 pc region .",
    "solar metallicity is assumed , merely because it favors the pdr .",
    "it is obvious that star formation can never compete with an xdr , for the same illuminating flux by energy , in terms of the very high @xmath77 co line intensities that are produced ."
