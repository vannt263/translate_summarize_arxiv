    "over the last few years , the study of galaxies with red rest - frame optical colors has been extended to ever - increasing redshifts .",
    "while the selection of galaxies based on their rest - frame uv emission ( e.g. the lyman break technique ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has enabled the detailed study of young galaxies at high redshift for some time , it is only with the more recent advent of efficient , large - scale detectors in the near - ir that large numbers of galaxies with redder rest - frame colors have been discovered at early cosmic epochs @xcite .",
    "red galaxies with typically very low uv fluxes make up 80% of the mass contained in the most massive galaxies @xcite and 25 - 75% of the total mass in galaxies at @xmath5 @xcite , and thus provide critical constraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "a proven technique for selecting galaxies with red rest - frame optical colors is the @xmath22 criterion ( @xmath23 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which relies on the balmer/4000  break redshifted into the @xmath24 band for redshifts @xmath2 .",
    "galaxies selected using this technique comprise a heterogeneous population showing a broad range in dust properties , luminosity - weighted ages , and star - formation rates @xcite .    in this letter , we extend the study of red galaxies to redshifts @xmath25 , and we compare the number and properties of red galaxies at @xmath26 to those at @xmath27 using uniform color selection criteria based on the balmer/4000break redshifted into the @xmath28 and @xmath29 bands , respectively . while there is typically a tail of sources extending beyond @xmath30 in @xmath31 selected samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there have been no systematic studies comparing the numbers and properties of red galaxies at the extremes of the broad @xmath31 redshift selection window .",
    "we adopt @xmath32 km / s , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "all magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "the top panel of fig .  [ fig : colors ] shows the observed @xmath35 color of @xcite template spectra over @xmath36 . at a given redshift , @xmath35 is reddest for the oldest template because the strength of the balmer/4000break increases as a stellar population ages . based on the figure",
    ", @xmath22 should select galaxies at @xmath2 that are either dominated by an evolved stellar population or are highly reddened by dust ",
    "the so - called `` distant red galaxies '' , or drgs @xcite . a number of drgs have been spectroscopically confirmed @xcite at @xmath2 , and large photometric samples of drgs are found to have @xmath37 @xcite .    because drgs have a fairly broad redshift distribution , the rest - frame properties of galaxies satisfying the color criterion to a given magnitude limit in a particular selection band change with redshift in three important ways .",
    "first , the limiting absolute magnitude in the selection band becomes brighter with increasing redshift for a fixed survey depth , probing sharply decreasing source densities at the bright end of the steep luminosity function .",
    "second , the rest wavelength of the selection band decreases with increasing redshift , probing wavelengths where the scatter in @xmath38 is large . finally , the rest - frame color  essentially the type of galaxy selected  changes with redshift because the balmer/4000  break is narrow in wavelength compared to the spacing between the @xmath29 and @xmath39 filters and because the spectral slope is not the same on both sides of the break for galaxies older than @xmath40 myr .",
    "together , these effects make it very difficult to compare drg properties at different redshifts .    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : colors ] demonstrates how splitting the @xmath31 criterion into two should divide drgs into two redshift bins , @xmath41    mitigating the problems described above that prevent direct analysis of the variation of red galaxy properties with redshift .",
    "the wavelength baselines of the two nir colors are similar enough that the same color limit can be used for both criteria to select identical rest - frame powerlaw spectral slopes .",
    "the criteria of equation [ eq1 ] are adopted analagous to @xmath22 to select against low-@xmath42 interlopers , while the selection efficiency of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 criteria may be further enhanced by the fact that those colors are steeper functions of redshift at the low-@xmath42 selection boundaries than @xmath35 .",
    "alternatively , one could select samples of galaxies based on their rest - frame properties estimated using distances determined from the galaxies photometric redshifts .",
    "we note , however , that the @xmath43@xmath44 calibration is poorly determined at @xmath25 , and therefore relying on photometric redshifts alone introduces large uncertainties in the analysis at high redshift .",
    "furthermore , by working in the observed frame , the results can be easily verified by others independent of photometric redshift or analysis techniques .",
    "we use the deep optical+nir photometry of the fires survey @xcite to select red galaxies at @xmath2 based on the two nir color criteria described above .",
    "details of the data reduction and @xmath45-selected source catalogs of the two fields of the survey , hdf - s ( 4.7 arcmin@xmath7 ) and ms 1054 - 03 ( 26.3 arcmin@xmath7 ) , can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "briefly , the combined catalog of the two fields contains hst @xmath46 ( hdfs - s ) , @xmath47 ( both fields ) , ground - based @xmath48 ( ms 1054 - 03 ) and isaac-@xmath49 ( both fields ) photometry , along with photometric redshifts determined following the procedure described by @xcite .",
    "details of the accuracy of the photometric redshifts in these fields are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the combined catalog depth is limited by the shallower ms 1054 - 03 observations . at @xmath50 ,",
    "the combined catalog is @xmath51 complete and sources in the ms 1054 - 03 catalog have @xmath52",
    ". the fires dataset provides a unique opportunity to select red galaxies at @xmath30even the brightest of which should still be quite faint in @xmath45since there are no other currently available surveys of comparable depth in all three @xmath53 nir filters .",
    "from the combined fires catalog we find 18 sources that satisfy @xmath54 and 23 sources with @xmath55 . the limiting magnitude in @xmath28",
    "was chosen such that the rest - frame limiting magnitude redward of the balmer/4000  break is the same for both samples , and its value was determined based on the ratio of the luminosity distances at the median redshifts of the two samples .",
    "the number of selected sources correspond to combined ( hdf - s - only ) surface densities and poisson errors of @xmath56 and @xmath57 arcmin@xmath58 for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 selected samples , respectively .",
    "the photometric redshift distributions of the nir selected sources are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zhist ] . the @xmath12 sample has @xmath59",
    "( 1-@xmath60 range ) and 16/18 galaxies also satisfy @xmath22 . for the @xmath13 sample , @xmath61 and 15/23 galaxies satisfy @xmath22 .",
    "if we consider comoving volumes bounded by tophat redshift distributions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the area - weighted space densities and associated poisson errors of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 samples are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the space density of a flux - limited sample of red galaxies remains constant within the errors from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "we note that the total survey area discussed here is relatively small and that our result is likely subject to cosmic variance , especially in light of recent studies that show that red galaxies at @xmath2 are strongly clustered @xcite .",
    "athough there is no appreciable change in the _ number _ of galaxies selected to have strong balmer/4000  breaks from @xmath66 to @xmath67 , their properties are quite different .",
    "[ fig : seds ] shows the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the two galaxy samples shifted to the rest - frame .",
    "the @xmath12 galaxies typically have red rest - frame uv - optical colors and a fairly flat rest - uv spectrum , consistent with previous studies of drgs in the redshift range @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the higher - redshift @xmath13 galaxies generally have blue uv - optical colors .",
    "the spectral slopes of the two samples through the balmer/4000  break are similar for the two samples , confirming that the nir color criteria proposed here select galaxies with similar @xmath68 colors over @xmath0 .",
    "we quantify the spectral shapes of the seds using the rest - frame uv power - law slope , @xmath69 @xcite , measured from a best - fit @xcite template with an exponentially decaying star formation rate ( @xmath70 myr ) and solar metallicity .",
    "the template fits to the broadband photometry hold the redshift fixed to the catalog  values , allow ages between 0.1 myr and the age of the universe at and allow @xmath71 mag following the extinction law of @xcite .",
    "corrections for ly@xmath72 forest absorption are applied following @xcite .",
    "the distributions of @xmath73 for the two galaxy samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] .",
    "the distribution is quite flat for the @xmath12 sample  similar to the distribution seen for a large sample of massive drgs by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of @xmath73 for the @xmath13 sample shows a peak at @xmath74 , values similar to those found by @xcite for uv - selected galaxies and to the sample of massive lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) discussed by @xcite .    of the 12 galaxies in the @xmath75 sample that have  in the range @xmath76 or @xmath77 , 10 have synthetic @xmath78 colors integrated from the best - fit templates that satisfy the @xmath79 or @xmath80 dropout lbg color criteria at those redshifts proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , 8 of those 10 galaxies with lbg colors have @xmath81 , too faint to be included in typical spectroscopic samples of lbgs .",
    "we have shown that we can efficiently select @xmath67 galaxies in the near - ir with the simple color criterion @xmath4 .",
    "the samples described here indicate that the rest - frame uv - optical seds of galaxies selected to have strong balmer/4000  breaks are significantly different at @xmath66 and @xmath67 : galaxies in the higher redshift sample have a median nuv / optical flux ratio @xmath82 times greater than that of the galaxies at @xmath66 .",
    "finding evolution in the properties of galaxies over the @xmath83 gyr between @xmath84 , which at the distant end is only 1.7 gyr after the big bang , is in itself not surprising , as the spectral evolution is rapid at these redshifts for galaxies with a broad range of formation redshifts and subsequent star formation histories .",
    "what is interesting is that the galaxies in both samples were selected to have similarly strong balmer/4000  breaks , indicating the presence of an evolved stellar population that itself would not be a likely source for the strong nuv component of the @xmath67 seds .",
    "a two - burst model whose optical sed is dominated by an evolved stellar population but that also contains a young component that supplies the uv flux could explain the @xmath67 seds .",
    "though two - component model fits are beyond the scope of this letter , there have been other observations of red galaxies at high-@xmath42 suggesting that composite populations are appropriate , both from sed modelling @xcite and from observations of distinct uv and optical galaxy morphologies @xcite of such galaxies .",
    "our @xmath85 template fits suggest that dust is the primary source of the difference in spectral shape shown in fig.[fig : seds ] . both samples have a median template age of @xmath83 gyr , while the median dust extinction decreases from @xmath86 to 0.2 mag going from the @xmath12 to the @xmath13 sample . in general one expects the dust content of galaxies , along with the metal content , to increase with time , qualitatively consistent with the analysis presented here .",
    "it is difficult to quantitatively compare our results to theoretical models of galaxy formation since such models typically rely on ad hoc treatments of dust absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , our results may be qualitatively consistent with the redshift distribution of submillimeter - selected galaxies .",
    "although still quite uncertain , there is evidence that the number of very dusty , luminous galaxies drops significantly from @xmath66 to @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the normalization of our population synthesis fits provides a rough estimate of the stellar mass of each galaxy in the sample . with our photometry sampling only the rest - frame uv - optical light of the galaxies in our sample at @xmath2 , the stellar mass fits are uncertain to factors of @xmath87 due to uncertainties in @xmath43 and in the imf and to model degeneracies between age , dust , metallicity , and star formation history . with those caveats in mind ,",
    "our template fits imply that the median stellar mass of red galaxies decreases by a factor of @xmath19 from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "while the uncertainties are large for the masses of individual galaxies , a mann - whitney test on the distribution of masses suggests that the difference in the median masses of the two samples is significant at the 99% confidence level .",
    "@xcite observe a similar trend in the mass of lbgs : the average dynamical and stellar masses of @xmath88 lbgs are a factor of 2 smaller than for lbgs at @xmath89 .",
    "we note here that the @xmath75 galaxies are not necessarily direct progenitors of the @xmath90 galaxies , just as lbgs at @xmath91 are not necessarily progenitors of lbgs at @xmath92 .",
    "many of the @xmath75 galaxies could fade below our magnitude limit after @xmath83 gyr ; conversely , many of the @xmath90 galaxies could have been much bluer 1 gyr previously .    since the space densities of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 samples are statistically equivalent , a decrease in the median stellar mass in the higher redshift sample , if real , would indicate a decrease in the stellar mass density of galaxies with evolved stellar populations .",
    "this may be consistent with the results of @xcite , who find that the ages of apparently passive galaxies at @xmath93 ( which make up 45% of their @xmath45-selected sample ) are typically @xmath94 gyr .",
    "it seems unlikely that many of the @xmath25 progenitors of these galaxies were already `` red and dead '' . on the other hand",
    ", this result may be difficult to reconcile with the existence of a significant population of @xmath95 galaxies at @xmath96 , as may be implied by the source described by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the best fit @xcite @xmath97 template of the @xcite source has @xmath98 and would be an outlier even at @xmath67 compared to the sources in our @xmath75 sample .",
    "clearly , much further work is required to fully understand how the properties of red galaxies change with time at @xmath2 .",
    "the differences shown in fig .  [ fig : seds ] are model independent , to the extent that the photometric redshifts approximate the true redshifts , but the results above based on template fits are quite uncertain .",
    "the addition of @xmath99 photometry would better constrain the stellar mass contained in these galaxies @xcite . the brightest galaxies in the @xmath13 sample may be within reach of nir spectroscopy that could precisely determine redshifts and model stellar populations based on the prominent balmer/4000  breaks , as has been done quite effectively for drgs at @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "finally we note that the ukidss ultra deep survey is planned to be @xmath1000.2 mag deeper than our adopted @xmath39 limit over an area @xmath101 times that of fires , which would vastly increase the sample sizes of galaxies selected as described here .",
