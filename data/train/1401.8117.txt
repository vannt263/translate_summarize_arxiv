    "the observational evidence have proved beyond doubt that the present universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "the exotic matter , the dark energy , causing the accelerated expansion of the universe is assumed to have a negative pressure .",
    "various models were proposed aimed at understanding the properties of dark energy . among these , the cosmological",
    "constant is the prominent one , but it faces the problems of fine tuning and also unable to explain the coincidence of dark energy density and dark matter density .",
    "this leads to consideration of dynamic dark energy models .",
    "among which holographic dark energy model @xcite based on the holographic principle is one of the prominent models discussing in the recent literature . according to the holographic principle @xcite",
    ", the vacuum energy density is bounded.the significance of the principle lies in the constraint that the total energy inside a region of size l , should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size . from effective quantum field theory ,",
    "an effective ir cut off can saturate the length scale , so that the dark energy density ( the vacuum energy density ) can be written as @xmath2 where c is a dimensionless numerical factor.the possible choices for the ir cut - off are the hubble horizon distance , particle horizon distance , event horizon distance and some generalized ir cut - off @xcite .",
    "but the first two options could not support the accelerated expansion of the universe while the event horizon posed the problem of causality.thus a new model has been introduced by granda and oliveros @xciteby taking the ricci scalar as the ir cut - off , and later studied by many others @xcite .",
    "this is seemed to be efficient in solving the coincidence problem , causality problem , and also the fine tuning problem .",
    "a modified form of this model was studied in interaction with dark matter assuming a hidden non - gravitational coupling existing between them @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will explore the thermodynamics , especially the status of the generalized second law of thermodynamics in a flat universe with holographic dark energy with ricci scalar as the ir cut - off , interacting with the dark matter .",
    "thermodynamics of cosmological models is of great interest after the discovery of the black hole thermodynamics @xcite by bekenstein and hawking @xcite which says that the entropy of the black hole is proportional to the area of it s event horizon @xcite . through the hawking radiation",
    ", the black hole could lose it s thermal energy which results in the decrease of its entropy and this is not allowed by the second law if black hole is assumed as an isolated system .",
    "it is explained as even though the entropy of the black hole decreases the loss is compensated by the increase in the entropy of the matter outside the black hole boundary , eventually the total entropy of the black hole plus that of the surrounding is increasing which is termed as the generalized second law ( gsl ) @xcite.the black hole thermodynamics is applied in the cosmological holographic model by l.susskind @xciteand t hooft @xcite which says that the maximum entropy of a bounded region is proportional to its area rather than its volume .",
    "gibbons and hawking @xcite studied the de - sitter model of the universe where apparent horizon and the cosmological event horizon are coincide with each other and found that the gsl is satisfied . assuming the whole universe as a thermodynamic system in which the validity of the first law of thermodynamics is undoubtedly assured , the present paper quests for the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics(gsl ) , in a universe filled with holographic dark energy interacting with the dark matter present .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics and gsl is found to be satisfied for the apparent horizon while violated in the case of event horizon for dark energy with constant equation of state and in a universe with generalized chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "the event horizon describes a global concept of space - time , hence a difficulty is said to appear in understanding hawking radiation clearly @xcite.thus there are arguments in favor of apparent horizon as the real physical boundary @xcite .",
    "hence we consider whether the gsl is satisfied by the apparent horizon and event horizon in the realm of holographic dark energy model , in order to discern the real physical boundary of the universe from the point of view of thermodynamics .",
    "the friedmann equations for flat universe with frw metric can be written as @xmath3 where h is the hubble parameter , @xmath4 is the energy density of the dark matter and @xmath5 is that of the holographic dark energy .",
    "the expression for the holographic dark energy with ricci scalar as the ir cut - off is @xmath6 where @xmath7 represent the derivative of h with respect to the cosmic time t and @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are parameters of the model .",
    "the interaction between the dark energy and dark matter is studied through the conservation equations given below @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the pressure of the dark energy , @xmath14 is the interaction term , dot represents the derivative with respect to time .",
    "dark matter is assumed to be pressure less .",
    "the term @xmath14 can have mainly three forms , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "for the present study we have considered the form , @xmath18 .    substituting , the dark energy density given by equation ( [ eqn : mhrde ] ) in the friedmann equation([eqn : friedmann1 ] ) , and changing the variable cosmic time t to the variable @xmath19 and differentiating the equation once more leads to the second order differential equation , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the present value of hubble parameter .",
    "the general solution for this can be obtained as @xmath23 where the constants are evaluated using the initial conditions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are obtained as @xmath26 and @xmath27 are obtained as @xmath28 using the friedmann equation , the dark energy density parameter can be obtained as @xmath29 the pressure of the dark energy and its equation of state parameter are calculated as , @xmath30.\\ ] ] and @xmath31 the evolution of the equation of state of the interacting holographic dark energy is plotted against redshift @xmath32 for the model parameters , @xmath33 and is shown in figure([fig : eos ] ) .",
    "the figure shows that in the past stage of the universe the equation of state was nearly zero .",
    "as the universe evolves the equation of state decreases and stabilizes as @xmath34     ]    in a dark energy dominated universe , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the coefficients in the above equation become @xmath37 and @xmath38 then the equation of state parameter become @xmath39 , which shows that for positive values of @xmath10 the equation of state @xmath40 corresponds to quintessence type behavior and for @xmath41 the equation of state @xmath42 corresponds to phantom behavior .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath43 for the dark energy considered is obtained as @xmath44 the nature of deceleration parameter is studied by plotting @xmath43     ]    against the redshift @xmath32 and the result is shown in the figure [ fig : q ] .",
    "it is evident from the figure that during the initial times in the evolution of the universe the @xmath43 parameter was positive implies deceleration in the expansion .",
    "as the universe expands the @xmath43 parameter enters the negative value region in the recent past , implying that the current acceleration was started in the recent past .",
    "it is also seen that the @xmath43 parameter saturates as @xmath34 for dark energy dominated universe with @xmath36 , the deceleration parameter become @xmath45 this implies that @xmath46 corresponds to quintessence type behavior , @xmath47 and @xmath41 corresponds to phantom behavior , @xmath48",
    "in this section the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics of the dark energy under thermal equilibrium is studied .",
    "the validity of the gsl implies that the sum of the change in entropy of the dark sectors added with the entropy change of the cosmological horizon is greater than or equal to zero @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the change in entropy of dark sectors with respect to cosmic time and @xmath51 is the change in horizon entropy with respect to cosmic time .",
    "the study is done by considering that the dark sectors and the horizon were in thermal equilibrium so that temperature of the dark sectors is equal to the temperature of the horizon . in the following",
    "we will analyse separately the gsl for universe with apparent horizon as boundary and event horizon as the boundary .      here",
    "the validity of the gsl is that sum of entropy of the dark energy , dark matter and the apparent horizon must increase with time @xcite .",
    "apparent horizon do exist for all kinds of frw universes @xcite .",
    "the apparent horizon is a causal horizon for the dynamical space time and is associated with gravitational entropy and surface gravity @xcite . for a universe with frw metric the apparent horizon radius can be obtained as @xmath52 for flat frw universe ( @xmath53 ) , the apparent horizon become @xmath54 which is same as the radius of the hubble horizon .",
    "the temperature on the apparent horizon can be defined as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the surface gravity @xcite . for flat universe",
    "the surface gravity depends on the horizon radius , and simple considerations will leads to the temperature as @xmath57    the entropy of the apparent horizon is @xmath58 with @xmath59 @xcite , where the area @xmath60 thus the entropy of the apparent horizon can be obtained as @xcite @xmath61 the entropy of the dark sectors can be found using gibbs equation given below @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the volume occupied by the dark entities and @xmath64 and the pressure @xmath65 has contribution only from the dark energy since dark matter is non - relativistic hence pressureless . thus using the above equations and the conservation equation of the dark sectors given in the previous section , the total entropy variation with respect to @xmath19 is obtained as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the equation of state parameter of the dark energy ,",
    "@xmath68 is the dark energy density parameter and @xmath43 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "the gsl is valid if @xmath69 since @xmath70 , the validity of the gsl requires that , @xmath71.$ ] this condition can approximately be translated as @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( a comparatively smaller value ) . in the present case where @xmath74 is comparatively small hence @xmath75 this is a reasonable bound for @xmath76 in this context and will lead to the increase in the change of entropy hence the validity of the gsl .",
    "the equation ( [ eqn : s1 ] ) can be further simplified using the relation for the @xmath43 parameter , @xmath77 the equation ( [ eqn : s1 ] ) can be re - written as     for the parameters @xmath33 thick continuous line , @xmath78 thin continuous line,@xmath79 dashed line and with the interaction coupling constant b=0.001 inside apparent horizon under thermal equilibrium conditions ]     for the parameters @xmath80 thick continuous line , @xmath81 thin continuous line,@xmath82 dashed line and with the interaction coupling constant b=0.001 inside apparent horizon under thermal equilibrium conditions ]    @xmath83    this equation shows that , as far as @xmath84 the gsl is satisfied for almost all kinds of dark energy , irrespective of the sign of @xmath43 which is positive for decelerated expansion ( radiation or matter dominated era ) and negative for accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "deceleration parameter @xmath85 ( corresponds to @xmath40 ) in the quintessence phase and @xmath86 ( corresponds to @xmath42 ) in the phantom phase of expansion .",
    "so both in the quintessence phase of expansion and in the phantom phase the gsl is satisfied with apparent horizon as the boundary of the universe .",
    "current cosmological observations hint that @xmath67 may be as lower as -1.5 @xcite . in the dark energy model we have considered equation ( [ eqn : qpar ] )",
    "implies that , in dark energy dominated case the universe is in the quintessence phase when @xmath46 and when @xmath87 the universe enter the phantom phase of expansion as @xmath34 equation ( [ eqn : sprime1 ] ) shows that the gsl is satisfied for both positive and negative values of @xmath10 parameter .",
    "we have studied the evolution of @xmath88 with @xmath89 using the equation of @xmath43 derived in the last section to check the above conclusions .",

    "for the further analysis we consider the universe with apparent horizon as the boundary .",
    "a complete thermal non - equilibrium condition means that there is no interaction between the dark sectors hence they have different temperatures that is,@xmath139 where @xmath140 is the temperature of the dark energy , @xmath141 is the temperature of the dark matter , and @xmath142 is the temperature of the horizon . using the gibb s relation the rate of change of the total entropy comprising that of entropy of the dark energy , dark matter and horizon",

    "it is clear from the remaining equation that the validity of the gsl demands that @xmath146 provided @xmath147 this implies that for an accelerating universe with @xmath148 the dark energy temperature is greater than horizon temperature , @xmath149 for the special case @xmath133 , corresponds to de sitter type universe in which @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the cosmological constant , the change in entropy is zero as a result the total entropy of the universe remains constant . for @xmath152 ,",
    "the gsl is satisfied provided @xmath153 the condition @xmath152 implies that the universe is in the phantom phase @xcite and for such phases of expansion the above equation shows that the dark energy temperature is less than the dark matter temperature .     for @xmath154=1.25 under thermal non - equilibrium condition ]    as a further case let us now avoid the dark matter contribution to the total entropy of the universe .",
    "the equation ( [ eqn : sfull1 ] ) now become , @xmath155 from this relation it can be shown that the gsl is satisfied if @xmath156     for @xmath154=1.25 under thermal non - equilibrium condition ]    in an accelerated expanding universe , i.e. @xmath157 and if the expansion is such that the universe will not enter the phantom behavior so that @xmath158 and @xmath159 then the above ratio implies that @xmath160 that is the dark energy temperature is greater than that of the horizon . in the cases of @xmath161 and @xmath152 corresponds to the phantom phase also the @xmath162 so in a dark energy dominated universe the temperature of the dark energy is greater than the temperature of the dark matter for the gsl to be valid .",
    "let us now assume that the temperature of the dark energy , @xmath163 especially assume that @xmath164 with @xmath165 then the entropy of the dark energy is @xmath166 where we have used the standard relation for entropy @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of @xmath168 with @xmath89 is shown in figure [ fig : sde - x.pdf ] and it is clear that the entropy of the dark energy is decreasing as the universe expands .",
    "the total entropy of the universe , which can be obtained by adding the horizon entropy to the above equation , we get ( avoiding the matter contribution ) , @xmath169 the evolution of this total entropy is plotted in figure [ fig : entropy2 ] , shows that the total entropy is increasing as the universe expands , and thus satisfying the gsl .",
    "this shows that the decrease in the entropy of the dark energy is compensated by the increase in the horizon entropy .",
    "this confirms our previous analyses that if the temperature of the dark energy is greater than the horizon temperature , the total entropy of the universe will always increases which guarantees the validity of the gsl .",
    "in this paper we have analysed the gsl in a flat universe with holographic dark energy and non - relativistic dark matter .",
    "the analysis were done both under equilibrium and non - equilibrium conditions . in equilibrium conditions",
    "the following are our main conclusions . in the case of taking apparent horizon as the boundary of the universe",
    ", we have obtained that rate of change of total entropy is proportional to @xmath0 hence the gsl is infact valid for any kind of dark energy .",
    "we have verified it with holographic dark energy with ricci scalar as the ir cut - off .",
    "so it can be concluded that the apparent horizon is a perfect thermodynamic boundary .",
    "we have also analysed the status of the gsl with event horizon as the boundary and found that in the presence of holographic dark energy the gsl is only partially satisfied for positive values of the model parameter @xmath10 but completely unsatisfied for negative values of the parameter . in literature",
    "there are studies regarding the status of the gsl at the apparent horizon . by considering viscous dark energy in non - flat universe ,",
    "it was found in reference @xcite that the gsl is valid at the apparent horizon . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors analyzed the validity of the gsl at the apparent horizon with logarithmic corrected entropy relation for the horizon and showed that the gsl is satisfied at the boundary if the model parameter @xmath170 and also holds for @xmath171 if @xmath172 so the validity of the gsl at the apparent horizon seems to be a general fact as advocated by our analysis .",
    "there are other studies in the literature regarding the status of the gsl at the event horizon .",
    "for example in references @xcite , the authors argued that the gsl is only partially satisfied at the event horizon of the universe .",
    "we have extended our analysis of the validity of the gsl with thermal non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "if there is partial non - equilibrium , such that the temperature of the dark sectors are equal and is different from the horizon temperature , the validity of the gsl demands that the temperature of the dark sector is greater than the horizon temperature if the expansion is the quintessence phase . on the other hand",
    "if the universe is in the phantom phase of expansion the dark sector temperature is less than the horizon temperature .",
    "but in a dark energy dominated universe ( avoiding the dark matter contribution ) , equivalent to be a condition of full non - equilibrium where all the components have different temperatures , the temperature of the dark energy is greater than the dark matter temperature both in quintessence and phantom phases of expansion",
    ". there are attempts to study the thermodynamics of the horizon under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "for example in reference @xcite , the authors have anlaysed the conditions for the validity of the gsl under non - equilibrium condition , however no specific conclusions or criterion were obtained for the validity of the gsl .",
    "so it seems difficult to analyses the status of gsl under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "however we carried out the analysis by assuming the validity of the gsl at the apparent horizon , and have shown that the gsl is valid if the dark energy temperature is greater than the horizon temperature .",
