    "the main objective in any location theory problem is to identify the ideal locations for setting up a facility for a set of customers .",
    "this problem is approached in different ways .",
    "the first one is called the efficiency oriented model where the objective is to minimise the sum of the total distance covered .",
    "this corresponds to the median problem in graph theory@xcite .",
    "when we are looking for locating undesirable facilities such as nuclear reactors , garbage dumps etc @xcite the objective becomes maximization of the sum of distances instead of minimization .",
    "this corresponds to the antimedian problem in graph theory @xcite .",
    "another approach is the effectiveness oriented model and this corresponds to the center problem in graph theory .",
    "this model is useful in locating emergency facilities such as ambulance , fire stations etc , @xcite .",
    "the center problem in graph theory has been studied extensively and various variants of centers have been introduced from time to time @xcite .",
    "we also have the anicenter problem in graph theory @xcite which is again used in obnoxious facility location problems .",
    "a third approach is the equity oriented model where equitable locations are chosen , that is locations which are more or less equally fair to all the customers .",
    "issue of equity is relevant in locating public sector facilities where distribution of travel distances among the recipients of the service is also of importance .",
    "most of the equity based study of location theory concentrate either on comparisons of different measures of equity @xcite or on giving algorithms for finding the equitable locations@xcite .",
    "also in many optimization problems , we have a set of optimal vertices .",
    "if we want to choose among these , one of the important criteria can be equity or fairness . taking a leaf out of these literature we define an equity measure called partiality(termed as range in @xcite ) and the sets of equitable locations corresponding to this measure in graphs , defined to be fair sets .",
    "rest of the paper is divided as follows , in the section preliminaries , we have some definitions , and results required for the paper . in section  [ cfs ] , we prove a result regarding connectedness of fair sets in trees , extend the result to block graphs , a generalization of tress , and finally charcterise chordal graphs , whose fair sets are connected . in section [ fscg ] , we discuss fair sets in some graph families namely complete graphs , complete bipartite graphs , odd cycles , wheel graphs and symmetric even graphs .",
    "we also have some partial results in the case of cartesian product of graphs in section  [ cp ] . in the last section  [ con ] we sum up giving the possibilities of some future work .",
