    "<S> nowadays , rapid advances in laser technology have made it possible to shape and control intense laser pulses consisting only of a few optical cycles ( typically , 5 fs for the ti : sapphira laser ) , opening up new frontiers for ultrafast physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to fully characterize such few - cycle pulses , the relative phase of the carrier wave with respect to the pulse envelope , i.e. , the carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) is required besides the pulse intensity , envelope and wavelength . in the few - cycle regime , the temporal evolution of the electric field depends sensitively on the cep . consequently , many strong - field interactions which are relevant to the electric field of the pulse rather than the intensity profile , become sensitive on the cep @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then the phase - stabilized few - cycle laser pulses provide us a precise tool to coherent control the electronic processes @xcite , and the ability to measure and stabilize the cep therefore becomes a crucial point for all applications .    </S>",
    "<S> many methods have been proposed for cep measurement based on the photonionization @xcite , ultraviolet ( uv ) and terahertz emission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the few - cycle laser pulse leads to a strong left - right asymmetry of photoelectrons @xcite , which has been observed and utilized as a meter of the cep @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the photonelectron emission from metal surfaces also shows a phase - sensitive property @xcite , suggesting a potential to measure the cep @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but for photonelectron signals , thousands of consecutive pulses measurement is usually required to achieve the required degree of accuracy . in recent </S>",
    "<S> work , haworth _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ proposed a method of spatio - filtering , which separated the high harmonic generation ( hhg ) in each half - cycle of the laser pulse in the spatio domain and the cep was retrieved form the harmonic spectrogram . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the high harmonic signal is easily detect and single short measurement becomes possible . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the spatio - filtering indicates a potential to cep measurement for a multi - cycle pulse ( @xmath110 fs ) , i.e. , better by half @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an alternative method to separate the half - cycle harmonic ( hch ) in the time domain , from which we retrieve the information of driving laser pulse , including the laser intensity , pulse duration and cep . </S>",
    "<S> our method is based on the hhg in a two - color field , which is illustrated in fig . [ fig1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the red line shows the 5-fs laser field @xmath2 . as the three - step model @xcite , the electron is first set free via photonionization at the laser peak and then is accelerated in the following half - cycle of the laser field , accumulating a kinetic energy of @xmath3 with a maximum of about @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the ionization and recombination times , @xmath7 is the ponderomotive energy and @xmath8 is the laser amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the electron recombines with the parent ion near the zero transition of the laser field by releasing its energy to high harmonics with the cutoff energy of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the atomic ionization energy . </S>",
    "<S> such a process occurs periodically in each half - cycle of the driving field as shown by the dotted line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) . however , how to observe the hch still is a challenge in experiments .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) electric fields of the few - cycle laser pulse ( red line ) and the uv pulse ( blue line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line shows the dependence of the electron energy ( @xmath11 ) on the ionization time in the few - cycle laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) high harmonic spectrogram as a function of delay between the laser and uv pulses ( see the movie for various ceps ) . </S>",
    "<S> the colorbar shows the harmonic intensity in logarithmic scale . </S>",
    "<S> the laser intensity is @xmath12 @xmath13 , pulse duration is @xmath14 fs full width at half maximum and the cep is 0 . </S>",
    "<S> the uv pulse intensity is @xmath15 @xmath13 and the duration is @xmath16 fs.,width=415 ]    as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) , ionization is the starter of hhg and each hch corresponds to a specific ionization time near the laser peak . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we mix a uv pulse to the laser pulse ( see the blue line ) . due to the high photon energy and ultrashort duration , the uv pulse significantly enhances the photonionization @xcite and also confines the ionization time in an interval of several hundred attoseconds @xcite , which has been demonstrated to control and enhance the hhg . here </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on how to distinguish the individual hch and to extract the driving pulse information from the harmonic spectrogram . in the two - color field as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) , the uv pulse firstly launches a free electron , initialing the hhg . the electron is then accelerated in the following half - cycle of the driving laser field , and finally recombines with the parent ion by releasing high harmonics . since the ionization is enhanced and confined in a short interval by the uv pulse , high harmonics generated in a half - cycle can be selected . scanning the uv pulse , </S>",
    "<S> each hch will be separated in the time domain , which also inherits the information of the driving field . from the harmonic spectrogram , the laser intensity , pulse duration and cep are </S>",
    "<S> therefore can be _ in situ _ retrieved during hhg .    for simulation , we solve the time - dependent schdinger equation ( tdse ) with the split - operator method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a ti : sapphire 5-fs laser pulse with a wavelength of 800 nm and an intensity of @xmath12 @xmath13 , the electric field reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the laser amplitude , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the laser frequency and cep , respectively , @xmath21 is the pulse envelope and the pulse duration is @xmath22 full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) . for the uv pulse , @xmath23 $ ] where @xmath24 is the delay between the laser and uv pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the uv pulse is @xmath15 @xmath13 , wavelength is 100 nm . we intend to select the hch , and hence set the uv pulse duration as 1 fs @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the optical cycle of the driving field . </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic spectrogram is shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1](b ) .     the dependence of half - cycle harmonic cutoffs on the cep . </S>",
    "<S> solid lines show the cutoffs obtained with the classical model . </S>",
    "<S> parameters are the same as fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1].,width=415 ]    one can see that the high harmonics produced in each half - cycle are clearly separated at different ionization times and the half - cycle cutoffs ( hcos ) are also distinguished . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , at @xmath27 , the harmonic spectrum ( marked by @xmath28 ) clearly shows a cutoff at @xmath29 , corresponding to the hch with the ionization time of @xmath30 shown in fig . [ fig1](a ) . scanning the uv pulse , we observe the other hchs , see harmonics @xmath31 for the hch with the ionization time of @xmath32 and 0 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the spatio - filtering , our method separates each hch in the time domain , which is therefore named as temporal - filtering . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our method also     retrieved ceps as a function of `` exact '' ones . </S>",
    "<S> parameters are the same as fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1].,width=264 ]    clearly separates the hchs with close cutoffs , e.g. , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , improving the resolution .    </S>",
    "<S> for the few - cycle pulse , the laser envelope and hence the amplitude vary significantly in a half - cycle of the laser pulse , leading to a different electron energy accumulated in each half - cycle , which is inherited by the hch . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , we can retrieve the detail information of the laser pulse from the spectrogram . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , we show the half - cycle cutoff ( hco ) as a function of ceps . for comparison , we also calculated the hcos with the classical three - step model @xcite , modified by taking account the initial energy when the electron is released . </S>",
    "<S> it can be estimated as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the height of the combined coulomb and driving laser field barrier at the ionization time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the initial energy is not significant for our parameters and is negligible if the uv photon energy is less than 8 ev ( the central wavelength is about 135 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown by the solid lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , which agree quite well with the hcos from tdse . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one can see that the hco depends sensitively on the cep of the driving field , enabling one to retrieve the cep from the harmonic spectrogram . for illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we refer the harmonic spectrogram obtained from tdse to the `` experimental '' results without knowing the cep , and then present an algorithm to retrieve the driving field information from the `` experimental '' spectrograms . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we calculate the hcos by the classical model for a 5-fs pulse with a range of intensities ( @xmath37 @xmath38 ) and ceps ( @xmath39 ) , establishing a database of the `` theoretical '' hcos . </S>",
    "<S> afterward , we extract the hcos from the `` experimental '' spectrograms and then compare it with the `` theoretical '' hcos . </S>",
    "<S> each comparison returns a value proportional to how well the two agree , which is defined as the square of the offset between the `` experimental '' and `` theoretical '' hcos . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the driving laser intensity and cep can be taken from the best match and the error from the standard deviation of the degree of agreement from this value . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity returned by the algorithm is @xmath40 @xmath13 , which agrees quite well with the `` exact '' value . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] presents the retrieved ceps , which also agree well with the `` exact '' ones . </S>",
    "<S> the largest deviation is @xmath41 and the average deviation is only @xmath42 .     </S>",
    "<S> high harmonic spectrogram as a function of delay between the driving laser and uv pulse in a ( a ) 8- and 11.5-fs laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> see the movie for a range of ceps . </S>",
    "<S> other parameters are the same as fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1].,width=415 ]    figure [ fig4 ] shows the harmonic spectrograms as a function of delay for a ( a ) 8- and ( b ) 11.5-fs laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly distinguish each hch and hco from these spectrograms . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] , we show the hcos for a range of cpes obtained from tdse and classical model . similarly , the detail information of the driving field can be retrieved from the harmonic spectrogram as the above discussions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our method also indicates a potential to extend the cep measurement to the multi - cycle regime .     </S>",
    "<S> same as fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , but for a 11.5-fs laser pulse.,width=415 ]    pulse duration is another important parameter for the ultrashort pulse , which is usually measured by frequency - resolved optical gating . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , the pulse duration can be retrieved from the comparison algorithm mentioned above , which however enlarges the calculation . here </S>",
    "<S> we present an alternative method for _ in situ _ pulse duration measurement during hhg . as the three - step model , the half - cycle harmonic cutoff @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the laser amplitude of the individual half cycle , i.e. , a series of values on the gaussian envelope . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , @xmath45 ^ 2 $ ] , suggesting that the pulse duration can be extracted by fitting the hcos with a gauss squared function . </S>",
    "<S> we devise a simple algorithm to deal with it . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , normalize @xmath46 by its maximum , consequently @xmath47 obeys the gauss - squared function @xmath48 ^ 2 $ ] , which is then transformed as @xmath49/2\\}^{0.5}\\sim{t / t}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter t can be retrieved with the least squares fitting method . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6](a ) , we shows the @xmath49/2\\}^{0.5}$ ] for a 5- ( circles ) , 8- ( triangles ) and 11.5-fs ( squares ) pulses , which are fitted by the red , green and blue lines , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the slopes are 0.6016 , 0.3688 , 0.2666 , and the parameter t is retrieved as 1.66 , 2.71 , 3.75 @xmath26 , corresponding to 5.18 , 8.5 , 11.77 fs , respectively , which all agree well with the exact values . note that this method enables one to retrieve the pulse duration without knowing the cep . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig6](b ) shows the @xmath49/2\\}^{0.5}$ ] and the fitted lines for the 5- , 8- , 11.5-fs pulses with a cep of @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the retrieved pulse durations are 5.48 , 8.6 and 12 fs , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have also calculated for other ceps , the deviations are bellow @xmath51 , showing that this method allows one measured the pulse duration independently on the cep .     </S>",
    "<S> the half - cycle harmonic cutoff @xmath52/2}\\sim{t / t}$ ] for a two- ( circles ) , three- ( triangle ) , four-(square ) laser pulse with the cep of ( a ) 0 and ( b ) @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line presents the fitted results . </S>",
    "<S> other parameters are the same as fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1].,width=377 ]    in summary , we investigate the hhg in an ultrashort linearly polarized laser pulse by mixing a weak uv pulse . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the uv pulse enhances and confines the photonionization in a short interval , and the high harmonics generated in the individual half cycle are clearly separated in the time domain by a 1-fs uv pulse . </S>",
    "<S> further , we show that the hcos depend sensitively on the cep of the driving field , enabling one to _ in situ _ retrieve the driving laser pulse information with a high accuracy . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we present an alternative way to measure the pulse duration independently on the cep , and the deviation of the retrieved pulse duration is bellow @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the influence of the fluctuation on our method . </S>",
    "<S> the test simulation shows that neither a variation of the intensity ( @xmath54 @xmath13 ) nor a variation of wavelength ( 80 - 150 nm ) of the uv pulse change the above results significantly . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can clearly distinguish the hch for a range of laser intensities of @xmath55 @xmath13 and a broader range is possible by taking other target atoms ( e.g. , he@xmath0 , ne ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hcos still are distinguishable when the pulse duration is increased to 15 fs , indicating a potential to cep measurement for a multi - cycle pulse . for even longer pulse </S>",
    "<S> , the hchs still are separated in the time domain , but the hco shift becomes more smaller and more difficult to measure . </S>"
