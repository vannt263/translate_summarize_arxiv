    "in recent years , atomic quantum dipolar gases have received much interest , for the simple reason that the anisotropic and long - range nature of the dipole - dipole interaction gives rise to a rich spectrum of novel properties to such systems .",

    "the effect of dipole - dipole interaction in @xmath0cr condensate is observed in its expansion dynamics  @xcite . besides chromium , heteronuclear molecules  @xcite and rydberg atoms  @xcite",
    "are also expected to interact via strong dipole - dipole force due to their large electric dipole moment , and their experimental realization is under way in a number of groups .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , three of us studied the ground state properties of a dipolar fermi gas by employing a variational wigner function based on the thomas - fermi density of identical fermions .",
    "we showed that the dipole - dipole interaction induces a deformation of the momentum space distribution , and identified that such deformation arises from the fock exchange term , which had not been paid particular attention in previous studies .",

    "@xcite , and investigate the collective excitations and expansion dynamics of the dipolar fermi gas .",
    "we want to emphasize that , due to the pauli exclusion principle , the energy scales of a fermionic system is much larger than those of a bose condensate .",
    "consequently , the dipolar effects in fermi gas only becomes significant when the dipole moment is very large .",
    "our calculations show that for heteronuclear molecules with typical electric dipole moment on the order of one debye , dipolar effects can be easily detected . while dipolar effects are usualy negligible in atomic fermi gases .",

    "<S> we investigate dynamical properties of a one - component fermi gas with dipole - dipole interaction between particles . using a variational function based on the thomas - fermi density distribution in phase space representation , </S>",
    "<S> the total energy is described by a function of deformation parameters in both real and momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> various thermodynamic quantities of a uniform dipolar fermi gas are derived , and then instability of this system is discussed . for a trapped dipolar fermi gas , </S>",
    "<S> the collective oscillation frequencies are derived with the energy - weighted sum rule method . </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies for the monopole and quadrupole modes are calculated , and softening against collapse is shown as the dipolar strength approaches the critical value . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate the effects of the dipolar interaction on the expansion dynamics of the fermi gas and show how the dipolar effects manifest in an expanded cloud .    </S>",
