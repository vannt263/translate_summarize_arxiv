    "the @xmath0 resonance is present in most of baryonic physics , due to its low energy and its strong coupling to the pion - nucleon systems .",
    "@xcite therefore it is is crucial to have good and simple methods to handle the @xmath0 resonance and its effects on other hadronic physics",
    ". such method should be based on a local theory where the renormalization is handled properly , and divergences can be re - absorbed consistently in the interactions . otherwise , the method is nothing more than a particular fit of the data , where the @xmath2 interactions have no universal meaning .",
    "especially this interaction should be handled properly , due to strength , which makes the application of perturbation theory dubious . in this paper",
    "we propose such a method with local interactions , which can be solved in closed form , without resorting to perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance is a spin 3/2 state , which is hard to handle in field theory , as it is generally part of a non - renormalizable field theory , due to the high - order derivatives in the coupling and the propagator , which yield high - order divergences in the self - energy corrections .",
    "furthermore , there are at least two other issues that blur our image of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "first , the propagator has some unknown off - shell dependence , reflected by a free parameter .",
    "second , field transformations allow different representations for the interactions and the propagators which , however , lead to identical observable results .",
    "@xcite    in this short paper all the problems raised above are circumvented .",
    "the propagator and the interaction are lumped together , so there are no issues concerning field transformations that shift terms around .",
    "furthermore , dimensional analysis , combined with local field theory , implies that the interaction depends , in lowest order , on four parameters only : two @xmath2 couplings , one @xmath3 couplings , and the @xmath0 mass .",
    "the finite renormalization constants are fixed by the @xmath0 mass and the wave function renormalization .",
    "the self - energy diagram  @xcite of the @xmath1 loop correction to the @xmath0 , which has an imaginary part because of the @xmath1 decay , has only two types of local momentum dependence of the loop integral in the rest frame : @xmath8}{e - \\omega_\\pi - \\omega_n } \\ \\ , \\label{self}\\ ] ] due to the different terms in the traces over polarizations and spins .",
    "the attention focusses on the real part .",
    "the same diagram occurs in other spin - isospin channels , with , possibly , different masses and coupling constants , however , the momentum and energy dependence will be the same . all the singularities are treated a principal value integrals . the imaginary part , associated with the homogeneous solution of the wave equation will follow from the eigenvalue equation below .",
    "@xcite the two different momentum dependencies are associated with two different vertices ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "they serve as the two @xmath9 couplings .",
    "furthermore , there is a third coupling for the @xmath3 contact interaction , which will yield the phase shift in the absence of the @xmath0 resonance in other spin - isospin channels . in lowest order ,",
    "the contact interaction is dominated by the pionic current @xmath10 $ ] which acts on the side of the triangle in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the two different time - orderings will be associated with two different terms in the hamiltonian .        for each channel and partial wave , in the rest frame , we can write down a general hamiltonian for low - energy @xmath1 scatttering based on the observations above : @xmath11 where @xmath12 if @xmath13 and zero otherwise .",
    "the momentum dependence of the contact interaction is based on a single @xmath3 coupling through the pionic current @xmath14 $ ] with the nucleon current @xmath15 , where the single derivative acts either on the incoming or the outgoing pion state , which leads to the asymmetric form .",
    "the coupling functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which correspond to local interactions , contain both two terms with the same functional form , however , different coupling constants ( @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 the kinematical factors @xmath20 make the interaction relativistic invariant , and the factor @xmath21 for @xmath22 is due to the local , derivative coupling , in the rest frame . the coupling constants @xmath23 have a dimension @xmath24$](gev ) , and @xmath25 has a dimension of @xmath26$](gev ) . all the numerical factors from angular integrations , etc . are lumped in with the coupling constants @xmath23 and @xmath27 . the self - energy diagram , eq .",

    "the effects of the contact interaction are not like what one would expect from perturbation theory .",
    "when the interaction is summed to all orders , the resonance dominate the results .",
    "any other , perturbative , effects will be irrelevant for the phase shift around the resonance peak . in all the different versions of the model , where some interactions are switched off , it is impossible to create the effect of a rising phase shift beyond @xmath138 after the @xmath0 resonance , usually associated with a background , without distorting the resonance itself .",
    "it can only consistently be explained by a second resonance , which is found around 2.5 - 4.0 gev .",
    "furthermore , from the data the @xmath139 coupling function prevails over the @xmath67 and the @xmath140 coupling functions , or even a combination of both with five fitting parameters , compared to the two of the @xmath139 coupling alone .    the same model , with different values for the coupling constants and the renormalization constants , fit the low - energy @xmath6 and @xmath5 data well , which have no resonance structure .",
