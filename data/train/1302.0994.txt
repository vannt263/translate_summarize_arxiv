    "an intriguing resemblance between the dependence of the shear modulus ( sm ) and torsional oscillator ( to ) frequency changes on temperature , amplitude , and concentration of @xmath9he impurities , has been experimentally observed in solid @xmath0he at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite crystal defects are clearly involved in both phenomena , however how sm and to fluctuations are exactly related remains yet a puzzle .",
    "day and beamish identified the stiffening of solid helium with decreasing temperature , i.e. , increase of its shear modulus , with the pinning / unpinning of dislocations by isotopic impurities .",
    "subsequent experiments have confirmed day and beamish interpretations  @xcite although recent elasticity measurements on ultrapure single crystals seem to suggest that sm variations can not be uniquely understood in terms of mobile dislocations .",
    "@xcite    torsional oscillator anomalies were first interpreted as the mass decoupling of a certain supersolid fraction ,  @xcite a counterintuitive physical phenomenon that andreev and lifshitz already proposed in solid helium more than 40 years ago .",
    "@xcite supporting this view is the fact that to anomalies appear to occur only in bulk @xmath0he .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the supersolid interpretation of to anomalies appears to leave open its connection to sm fluctuations and diverse theoretical arguments and hypotheses have been put forward in an attempt to simultaneously rationalize the origins of both anomalies .",
    "anderson , for example , proposes that supersolidity is an intrinsic property of bosonic crystals , which is only enhanced by disorder , and that the elastic anomaly is due to the generation of vortices at temperatures close to the supersolid transition .",
    "@xcite from a diametrically opposite standpoint , reppy has argued that the to behavior is caused by an increase of the @xmath0he shear modulus which mimics mass decoupling by stiffening the to setup .",
    "@xcite other scenarios somewhat more reconciling with the original to and sm interpretations have been also proposed in which for instance mass superflow is assumed to occur in the core of dislocations only when these are static .",
    "@xcite    as it can be appreciated , definitive conclusions on the roots of sm and to anomalies remain contentious . in a recent paper , chan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that for solid @xmath7he in vycor the nonclassical moment of inertia ( ncri ) disappears if the to setup is designed in such a way that is completely free from any shear modulus stiffening effect .",
    "this result seems to show that ncri can be totally attributed to elastic effects and not to the existence of a supersolid fraction .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , a recent experiment in which dc rotation was superposed to both to and sm measures suggested that the cause of both anomalies below a critical temperature could have different microscopic origins .",
    "@xcite also , the source of a small peak in the specific heat of @xmath0he  @xcite at temperatures close to that at which to and sm anomalies appear remains yet unexplained .",

    ", , and are shown for comparison .",
    "solid lines represent linear fits to dmc results ( see text ) . ]    in this work , we study the change in the elastic constants of solid @xmath7he caused by the presence of small point defects concentrations , @xmath10 , of @xmath11  %  .",
    "as it has been shown , the presence of vacancies induces a finite superfluid fraction in the crystal ( incommensurate crystal , ic ) so that we can theoretically compare the elastic constants of a supersolid with those of the perfect crystal ( commensurate crystal , c ) .",
    "in particular , we estimate the pressure dependence of the elastic constants @xmath12 s ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where the last one is also known as the shear modulus ) and derived quantities ( the @xmath13 debye temperature and transverse / longitudinal speeds of sound ) of bulk ic and c hcp @xmath0he .",
    "our calculations show that ( i )  under moderate and large compressions the c phase is globally stiffer than the ic solid , ( ii )  at pressures close to melting ( i. e. @xmath8  bars ) some of the elastic constants accounting for specific strain deformations of the hcp basal - plane ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are slightly larger in the ic crystal , and ( iii )  the shear modulus difference between c and ic @xmath0he crystals is about @xmath14 to @xmath15 times smaller ( in absolute value ) than the experimentally observed @xmath5 variation caused by the pinning / unpinning of dislocations .    the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in the next section , we briefly describe the computational methods employed and provide the details of our calculations .",

    "he expressed as a function of the superfluid fraction at pressures close to melting .",
    "the dashed line is a guide to the eyes . ]",
    "in this study we employ the diffusion monte carlo method ( dmc ) , an accurate ground - state approach in which the schrdinger equation of a @xmath16-particle interacting system is solved stochastically by simulating branching and diffusion processes in imaginary time .  @xcite as it is usual in dmc , we introduce a guiding wave function ( gwf ) for importance sampling that crucially reduces the variance of the statistical estimations .",
    "our gwf model is symmetric under the exchange of atoms and correctly reproduces the experimental equation of state of solid @xmath7he and other quantum crystals .",
    "@xcite we note that dmc energies are virtually exact , i.e. are only subjected to statistical bias , and ultimately do not depend on the particular choice of the guiding wave function .",
    "the value of all technical parameters , i.e. size of the simulation box , population of walkers , and length of the imaginary time - step , have been set in order to ensure convergence of the total ground - state energy to less than @xmath17  k / atom . as in previous works ,",
    "we modeled the @xmath0he-@xmath0he interactions with the aziz  ii pairwise potential .  @xcite further technical details of our elastic constant calculations can be found in refs .  .",
    "it is important to stress that dmc @xmath12 estimations essentially rely on computation of total energies as a function of strain thus numerical errors stemming from finite - size effects can already be made negligible ( i.e. smaller than @xmath17  k / atom ) in computationally affordable simulation boxes of @xmath18    @xmath19  @xmath18    @xmath19  @xmath20     containing @xmath21 atoms .",
    "the ic phase is built by introducing small vacancy concentrations of @xmath11  % in the crystal .",
    "although it is well - known that the presence of point defects in solid @xmath0he is energetically penalized ,  @xcite this route allows for simulation of supersolids under tight and controllable conditions .",
    "@xcite    % ) of hcp @xmath0he expressed as a function of pressure .",
    "the size of the error bars are indicated within the parentheses .",
    "positive @xmath22 values indicate softening of the corresponding elastic constant in an hypothetical vacancy - induced normal - to - supersolid phase transition . ]",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] , we show the shear modulus of c and ic ( with @xmath23  % ) hcp @xmath0he expressed as a function of pressure .",
    "we find that in both states @xmath5 behaves linearly with pressure over all the range of densities considered , i.e. @xmath24  @xmath25",
    ". as one may also see , the shear modulus of the c crystal is larger than that of the ic solid and the value of the @xmath26 difference increases under compression .",
    "it must be noted that the numerical uncertainty in our @xmath5 calculations is @xmath27  bar thus the predicted @xmath28 values are rigorously different from zero at pressures above @xmath29  bar ( see fig  [ fig3 ] ) .    in principle",
    ", one may expect that besides pressure @xmath28 variations are also dependent on the imposed fraction of mass superflow , or conversely , the concentration of point defects .",
    "however , as we show in fig  [ fig2 ] , such a dependence turns out to be rather weak .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath30  % interval @xmath5 decreases in less than the @xmath27  % of its ground - state value and even when an excessive @xmath31 value of @xmath32  % is constrained the accompanying variation of shear modulus is of just @xmath33  % .",
    "concerning possible temperature effects , it is well - known that the contribution of phonon excitations to the thermal energy of solids reduces the speeds of sound by an amount that is proportional to @xmath34 , so implying a @xmath35 dependence in the elastic constants .",
    "@xcite our zero - temperature conclusions on @xmath28 , therefore , can be fairly generalized to the regime of ultralow temperatures ( that is , few mk ) .",
    "in fact , the ground - state results reported in this study are in very good agreement with those obtained by pessoa _",
    "et al . _ for hcp @xmath0he at @xmath36",
    "k using the path integral monte carlo method .",
    "@xcite    it must be stressed that our @xmath5 results are obtained for pure , i.e. with zero concentration of @xmath9he atoms , and free - of - dislocations @xmath0he single crystals hence direct comparisons to day and beamish  @xcite data obtained in polycrystals turn out to be very complicate . in the light of our results , however , one may notice that experimentally observed shear modulus variations caused by the pinning / unpinning of dislocations are of opposite sign and about one order of magnitude larger ( @xmath37  % in polycrystals and @xmath38  % in monocrystals  @xcite ) than fluctuations reported here for hypothetical superfluid mass flows of @xmath39  % ( see fig  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we may conclude that if a vacancy - induced normal - to - supersolid phase transition occurred in solid helium dislocation - mediated mechanical contributions to @xmath5 would totally overwhelm those stemming from mass superflow .",
    "interestingly , rojas _",
    "have recently reported an anomalous softening of high quality ultrapure monocrystals in the temperature region wherein supersolidity could occur .",
    "@xcite    we have also determined the @xmath40 deviations describing the response of c and ic hcp crystals to strain basal plane deformations .",
    "@xcite first , we note that all these components also present a linear dependence on pressure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where numerical uncertainties are indicated within parentheses ) .",
    "second , @xmath22 slopes are all positive thus implying that beyond a certain critical pressure c hcp @xmath0he is plainly stiffer than the ic crystal . according to our calculations ,",
    "this critical pressure is above @xmath41  bar .",
    "interestingly , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are largest , by a small amount , in the ic solid at pressures below @xmath29 and @xmath42  bar respectively . this outcome comes to show that in an hypothetical low pressure normal - to - supersolid phase transition , the final supersolid could behave more rigidly than the initial normal state under certain strain deformations .",
    "nevertheless we find that the @xmath43 coefficient , which is defined as @xmath44 and can be directly measured in acoustic experiments , is always smaller in the ic state .",
    "this behavior is analogous to the tendency found for the shear modulus although @xmath43 variations are in general larger ( e.g. at @xmath45  bar @xmath46 whereas at @xmath47  bar @xmath48 ) .    -axis  ( c ) of c and ic ( @xmath23  % ) hcp @xmath0he as a function of pressure .",

    "_ bottom : _ estimated @xmath6 debye temperature of c and ic hcp @xmath0he as a function of pressure .",
    "experimental data from refs .   and   are shown for comparison.,title=\"fig : \" ]    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the calculated longitudinal and transversal speeds of sound ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) of c and ic hcp @xmath0he under pressure .",
    "@xcite as one can observe , @xmath49 velocities along the hcp @xmath51-axis and basal plane are slightly larger in the ic crystal within approximately the same pressure range in which @xmath52 and @xmath53 deviations are found to be negative .",
    "nevertheless , speeds of sound deviations near melting turn out to be so small that in practice these could probably not be detected with standard means .",
    "the same can be concluded about the @xmath6 debye temperature for which , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the corresponding c - to - ic variation is smaller than the typical experimental precision . in view of these technical limitations",
    ", it would be very interesting to perform new @xmath12 and @xmath54 measurements on @xmath0he at large pressures ( i.e. @xmath55  bar ) where c - to - ic differences develop larger . to this regard , spectroscopic measurements of the @xmath56 phonon mode ( i.e. the shear mode corresponding to the beating of the two hcp sublattices against each other in the two orthogonal directions of the basal plane ) would be particularly helpful since in this type of experiments ( i )  @xmath12 values can be determined with a very small imprecision of less than the @xmath57  % , ( ii )  tiny solid samples are needed ( i.e. of @xmath58 m size ) thus likely crystal quality issues present in sm and to experiments could be somehow alleviated , and ( iii )  pressure conditions can be efficiently tuned .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the elastic properties of hcp solid @xmath0he in a metastable ic state and compared them to those obtained for its c ground - state .",
    "our calculations show that near melting elastic constants @xmath1 and @xmath2 accounting for specific strain deformations of the hcp basal plane are slightly larger in the ic crystal . at moderate and high pressures ,",
    "however , the c phase is always stiffer than the ic . also , we find that the appearance of a finite superfluid fraction ( e.g. @xmath59  % ) caused by the introduction of vacancies unequivocally provokes a small decrease of the @xmath0he shear modulus ( i.e. @xmath60  % ) .",
    "we argue then that if a vacancy - induced normal - to - supersolid phase transition occurred in helium crystals containing isotopic impurities and line defects , dislocation - mediated contributions to @xmath5 would totally overwhelm those stemming from mass superflow . as an alternative to usual dynamic experiments focused on the search of hypothetical supersolid manifestations",
    ", we suggest to perform spectroscopic measurements of the @xmath56 mode of @xmath0he at moderate and high pressures .",
