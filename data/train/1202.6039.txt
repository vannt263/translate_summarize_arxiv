    "pair diffusion features prominently in theories of reaction - diffusion dynamics@xcite describing processes where reactant encounters are required , such as ligand binding and aggregation or fluorescence quenching .",
    "the hydrodynamic interactions quantified by the distance - dependent diffusion coefficient are also central to the theory and simulation of polymer dynamics , including protein folding simulations in implicit solvent , the hydrodynamic coupling in dense colloidal suspensions , and the function of nanomachines and bacterial flagella.@xcite considering the broad importance of pair diffusion in theories of molecular kinetics , it may seem surprising that little is known about the pair diffusion coefficient and its dependence on the particle distance .",
    "formidable challenges in both theory and simulations@xcite have resulted in often contradictory results for this fundamental quantity .",
    "theoretically , the pair diffusion coefficient @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 the distance between two particles ) has been attacked from two opposite directions , building up from kinetic theory@xcite or projecting down from macroscopic hydrodynamics.@xcite for @xmath0 , kinetic theory had limited success at high fluid packing densities , largely because of the complexity of the molecular motions in dense fluids resulting from their many - body character . at the other extreme ,",
    "details of the molecular structure of the solvent are ignored in estimates of the pair friction derived from macroscopic hydrodynamics , for instance by using the oseen or rotne - prager tensors.@xcite nevertheless , this approach has proved useful in studies of the dynamics of large and sufficiently distant pairs of colloidal particles in a solvent,@xcite where macroscopic hydrodynamics is expected to apply ; but it is not immediately applicable when solute and solvent particles are of comparable size , for instance in ( aqueous ) solutions of ( bio)polymers .    here , we determine the pair diffusion coefficient directly from the simulated many - body dynamics in a dense fluid .",
    "we focus on particles of the same size as the solvent molecules .",
    "this small - solute regime is of particular relevance because , on the one hand , it allows us to quantify hydrodynamic interactions relevant for molecular motions , including the dynamics of ( bio)polymers in solution , and , on the other hand , it is far outside the regime where macroscopic hydrodynamics should be expected to apply .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in section",
    "i , we describe the methodological details , including the theory to calculate the pair diffusion tensor , the algorithm used to determine the required green s functions from simulation data , the simulation parameters , and the validation procedure .",
    "we validate our method by computing the pair diffusion coefficient for two spherical particles subject to brownian dynamics . in the results section",
    "ii , we first present a comparison of green s functions obtained from simulations against those predicted from our diffusion model , finding excellent agreement over 8 orders of magnitude .",
    "then we examine the pair diffusion coefficients as a function of distance between two particles for several fluid packing fractions , and compare the simulation results to the predictions of macroscopic hydrodynamic theories .",
    "finally , we show that the position - dependent pair diffusion coefficient is correlated to the local available volume . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss the calculation of the angular pair diffusion coefficient .",
    "in the following we present the theory to calculate the position - dependent pair diffusion tensor from simulation trajectory data .",
    "the diffusion tensor @xmath4 of the vector @xmath5 between two given particles in an isotropic and homogeneous fluid has spherical symmetry : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the length of the pair vector ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the scalar diffusion coefficients in the radial and tangential directions , respectively ; and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the orthonormal unit vectors of the spherical polar coordinate system , with @xmath10 pointing in the radial direction , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 being tangential to longitudes and latitudes , respectively .",
    "the smoluchowski ( or fokker - planck ) equation describing the diffusion of the pair vector then takes on the following form : @xmath13\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the green s function for a pair vector starting at a distance @xmath15 and azimuthal angle @xmath16 , without loss of generality because of the isotropic space ( making the @xmath17 distribution uniform ) ; @xmath18 is the distance - dependent free energy surface ; @xmath19 is the inverse temperature ; @xmath20 is the partial derivative with respect to time ; and `` div '' and `` grad '' are the divergence and gradient operators in spherical polar coordinates , respectively .",
    "we will in the following use @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the green s function in terms of this new variable .",
    "the diffusion equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : smolu ] ) then becomes : @xmath24}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{d_\\parallel(r)}{r^2}\\partial_x\\left[(1-x^2)\\partial_xp\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 . by integrating over @xmath21",
    "we obtain a diffusion equation for the green s function in the radial direction alone , with the second term on the right hand side vanishing : @xmath26~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the probability for the pair distance to be in @xmath28 at time @xmath29 , starting from @xmath30 at time 0 . as a consequence ,",
    "we can treat radial diffusion separately using standard one - dimensional diffusion , irrespective of the angular motion . in an appendix",
    ", we outline an extension of the theory to the orientational diffusion of the pair distance vector .      here",
    "we focus on the calculation of the position - dependence of the pair - distance diffusion coefficient @xmath31 , where we have dropped the subscript for notational simplicity . in our calculations of @xmath0",
    ", we face the dual challenges that it depends on the particle distance @xmath1 , and that the pair dynamics becomes diffusive only at times at which the influence is felt of the underlying free energy surface ( or potential of mean force ) , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the pair correlation function of the two particles in the fluid . to disentangle the diffusive spread of the pair distance distribution from the drift of the mean position as a result of the underlying free energy surface , we use the propagator ( or green s function ) @xmath34 . in constructing a diffusion model , we assume that @xmath35 satisfies the smoluchowski diffusion equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : dr ] ) , where the term within the brackets is the negative of the radial probability flux . a spatial discretization of the smoluchowski equation@xcite results in a master equation that describes the pair dynamics between neighboring intervals along @xmath1 .",
    "the particle - pair trajectories in the simulations are discretized by assigning pair distances into bins @xmath36 along @xmath1 , and then counting the numbers @xmath37 that a pair distance is in bin @xmath36 at time @xmath38 , and in bin @xmath39 at time @xmath40 , irrespective of its location at intervening times , with @xmath41 the lag time .",
    "@xmath37 is symmetrized , @xmath42 , consistent with microscopic time reversibility .",
    "we then find the pair diffusion coefficient @xmath0 that maximizes the path action of the observed discretized path .",
    "for the discretized diffusion model with given @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the path action ( or likelihood ) @xmath45 can be be written as a product of green s functions that are expressed in terms of a matrix exponential.@xcite to optimize the action and find the diffusion model most consistent with the observed @xmath37 , we infer @xmath43 and @xmath44 using a bayesian approach,@xcite with uniform priors in @xmath46 and @xmath44 ensuring scale invariance in time and space .    in free diffusion ,",
    "one typically fits @xmath47 ( or , equivalently , @xmath48 ) to the mean - square displacement , with the constant @xmath49 ( or the time shift @xmath50 ) accounting for initial fast molecular motions . here , we employ a similar procedure by optimizing also the time origin @xmath38 for transition counts @xmath51 collected at several different lag times @xmath52 , where @xmath29 defines the `` observation time . ''",
    "to validate the procedure , we first run brownian dynamics simulations for two spherical particles of unit diameter freely diffusing with diffusion coefficient @xmath53 in a cubic box of length @xmath54 under periodic boundary conditions and with reflecting boundaries at particle contact . by construction , in this case @xmath55 , which is indeed recovered by the procedure for distances @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "[ brownian ] ) , nearly independent of grid size @xmath57 .",
    "however , for @xmath58 and long lag times , the periodic boundary conditions cause artifacts because in the corners of the cubic simulation box the pair dynamics projected onto the minimum image distance depends not only on the length of the pair vector but also on its direction .",
    "to calculate @xmath0 for a particle pair in a dense fluid , we perform discontinuous molecular dynamics ( dmd ) simulations of hard sphere ( hs ) fluids . in dmd , particles follow linear trajectories between collisions . in a collision , the velocities of colliding particles are changed to conserve energy and momentum.@xcite to simplify the notation , dimensionless quantities will be used , obtained by appropriate combinations of a characteristic length ( hs particle diameter @xmath59 ) and time scale ( @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the particle mass ) .",
    "the packing fraction @xmath62 is defined in terms of the particle density @xmath63 . to construct the green s functions , we performed dmd simulations with @xmath64 identical hs particles .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions .",
    "the average self - diffusivity @xmath65 was obtained by fitting the long - time ( @xmath66 ) behavior of the average mean - squared displacements @xmath67 of the particles to the einstein relation @xmath68 . to minimize the system - size dependence,@xcite trajectories from simulations with @xmath69 particles",
    "were used to determine @xmath65 , with remaining finite - size corrections of @xmath701  % .@xcite",
    "to test the applicability of the diffusion model , we compare its prediction for the dynamics of the pair distance to actual simulation data collected over a range of time scales .",
    "figure  [ greens ] shows that diffusion quantitatively captures the pair dynamics in the fluid .",
    "the green s functions @xmath71 from the diffusion model and the results of the dmd simulation data are found to agree over 8 orders of magnitude . at the shortest observation time @xmath72",
    ", we find that the green s functions are essentially gaussian with position - dependent widths . at longer times , @xmath73 and 20",
    ", the underlying free energy surface shows its influence , distorting the propagators away from the gaussian form expected for free diffusion on a flat surface .    in figure  [ param ]",
    ", we explore the effects of the spatial grid size @xmath57 and the observation time @xmath29 on the calculated pair diffusion coefficient .",
    "we find that for @xmath74 , grid size effects are negligible .",
    "figure  [ param ] ( bottom ) shows that the effect of changing the observation time @xmath29 is negligible only for shorter distances @xmath75 .",
    "in contrast , for longer distances @xmath0 is almost flat at a short observation time @xmath76 and does not show the asymptotic @xmath3 dependence expected from macroscopic hydrodynamic theory .",
    "however , the expected @xmath3 dependence is recovered for longer times @xmath29 .",
    "this result implies that the hydrodynamic coupling at large distances is not instantaneous , such that a more accurate diffusion model would require the inclusion of memory effects in a frequency and position - dependent diffusion coefficient.@xcite for @xmath77 the predictions are essentially independent of @xmath29 . in all following calculations ,",
    "we thus use @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "+    having validated the procedure and diffusion model , we now examine the distance - dependent pair diffusion coefficients @xmath0 for different packing fractions @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ dr ] ( top panel ) shows @xmath0 for the hs fluid over a packing fraction range @xmath81 ( symbols from top to bottom ) .",
    "also shown are the predictions for @xmath0 from hydrodynamic theory for two spherical particles with slip boundary conditions,@xcite as well as the widely - used oseen tensor correction@xcite ( for @xmath82 ; dashed line ) , which for the pair diffusion coefficient is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the solvent shear viscosity , taken from ref .  .",
    "we find that both the exact hydrodynamic theory and the oseen approximation ( and similarly the rotne - prager tensor;@xcite not shown ) are remarkably accurate and quantitatively reproduce the large-@xmath1 behavior .",
    "however , hydrodynamic predictions only qualitatively reproduce the observed decrease in @xmath0 near contact ( @xmath85 ) and lack any structure due to molecular correlations in the first- and second - shell around a particle .    to characterize the effects of the molecular packing structure on the pair dynamics , we plot in fig .",
    "[ dr ] ( bottom panel ) the normalized pair diffusion coefficient @xmath86 for different packing fractions @xmath80 . as expected from macroscopic hydrodynamics , at large distances @xmath1 the @xmath86 data collapse onto a single curve that is well represented by the hydrodynamic theory .",
    "two important observations are : ( i ) @xmath86 is always less than 1 , with pair diffusion slowed down by `` hydrodynamic interactions . ''",
    "( ii ) @xmath0 rises sharply just outside distances of 1 and 2 particle diameters , and drops sharply just outside @xmath87 , and 2.5 .",
    "this strong position dependence , together with the short - time propagator @xmath88 for brownian dynamics being gaussian with mean @xmath89 $ ] , implies that at short times particle pairs just outside the first and second shell boundary `` drift '' outward , whereas those inside the boundary drift inward , beyond what is expected from the free energy gradient @xmath90 alone .",
    "the additional drift terms arise from the large gradients in @xmath0",
    ". we can understand this dynamic behavior ( which does not violate microscopic time reversibility and detailed balance ! ) from the many - body packing effects . at @xmath91 , for instance",
    ", the interstitial space between the two particles is likely filled by a third one , which tends to drive the pair apart .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath92 , the interstitial space between the two particles is empty , and the two particles tend to move closer together .    to gain further insight into the observed structure in @xmath0 and its relation to the static structure of the fluid , we plot in figure  [ gr - dr]a both @xmath0 and the pair correlation function @xmath33 .",
    "we find that there is some correlation between the structure in @xmath0 and @xmath33 except near the contact distance at @xmath85 where these quantities are actually anti - correlated .",
    "somewhat counter - intuitively , this mostly positive correlation means that the pair diffusion is actually higher in the more densely packed regions .",
    "similar behavior was observed for a hs fluid confined between hard walls where the local density was found to be strongly correlated with the local diffusion coefficient except near the walls.@xcite this behavior was found to be related to the physics of layer formation , with the available volume , as probed by the local test - particle insertion probability @xmath93 , being largest in the locally dense regions of space.@xcite a similar argument should hold in our case of a bulk hs fluid in which purely entropic excluded volume forces give rise to a structured @xmath33 profile to maximize the system entropy .",
    "the local insertion probability is given by @xmath94 , where the activity @xmath95 is spatially invariant for an equilibrium fluid , with @xmath96 the chemical potential , and @xmath97 the thermal wavelength .",
    "+    to test if @xmath0 is indeed related to @xmath98 , we calculate @xmath99 for the different packing fractions by utilizing grand canonical transition - matrix monte carlo simulations.@xcite figure  [ gr - dr]b shows @xmath0 versus @xmath98 for different @xmath80 .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 data approximately collapse onto a curve similar to the average bulk relationship ( @xmath100 versus @xmath93 ) that ignores any @xmath1 dependence .",
    "therefore , at least as a rough approximation , the local available volume can describe the pair diffusion in this case .",
    "the results of this paper shed light on the microscopic origins of the distance dependence of hydrodynamic interactions , in particular the role of particle packing and many - body motions , and help establish a range of validity for the assumption of macroscopic hydrodynamics in the modeling of processes ranging from polymer dynamics to nanomachines , colloidal dynamics , and bacterial swimming . in practical applications , such as the calculation of diffusional encounter rates , the significant deviations between the calculated pair diffusion coefficients @xmath0 and the ideal ( and widely used ! ) assumption of @xmath101 can result in substantial errors , with @xmath102 consistently . at",
    "the least one should use a hydrodynamic theory , with both the exact theory and the oseen tensor giving remarkably accurate results for hydrodynamic interactions at larger distances , and rough approximations in the regime dominated by molecular packing near contact .",
    "to treat the angular diffusion of pair distance vectors ( or other vectors in an isotropic space ) , we notice that the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : smolux ] ) corresponds to the angular momentum operator in quantum mechanics .",
    "we thus make the ansatz @xmath103 , where the @xmath104 are the legendre polynomials of order @xmath105 , and the coefficients @xmath106 do not depend on @xmath29 and @xmath1 . with this ansatz",
