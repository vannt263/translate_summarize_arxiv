    "the driving force behind many of the extensions of the standard model ( sm ) has been the hierarchy puzzle .",
    "however , there may be reasons that the fine tuning of quadratically large contributions to the higgs mass from very high momentum scales is acceptable ( e.g. , environmental reasons ) .",
    "this motivates the consideration of simple extensions of the standard model that do not address the hierarchy puzzle and do not introduce any additional fine tunings of parameters .",
    "the sm provides no understanding why there are three generations of chiral fermions with masses that require weak symmetry breaking or why they only come in such simple representations of the gauge group .",
    "vector - like fermions can be much heavier than the sm fermions , since their masses do not require weak symmetry breaking . for some choices of quantum numbers ,",

    "we compute this contribution to meson mixing in the 7 models that involve strongly interacting vector - like fermions .",
    "in addition to considering @xmath4 and @xmath5 flavor - changing neutral - current processes , we also briefly discuss violations of lepton universality and unitarity of the ckm matrix that arises from the corrections to the @xmath6 boson couplings in these models .",

    "can be neglected .",
    "if the new fermion is in a real representation it can have a majorana mass term which does not require a helicity partner in the spectrum . in that case , unless the majorana mass is very large or the yukawa coupling of the new neutral fermion to the sm neutrinos is very small , a sm neutrino gets an unacceptably large mass .",
