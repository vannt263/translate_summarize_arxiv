    "in the study of gaseous halos , most of the recent observational focus has been on nearby normal spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "relatively little attention has so far been paid to low - luminosity spirals , but an hi halo has been detected by @xcite in the edge - on ugc 7321 . in order to determine the origin of gaseous halos , it is important to pursue the line of investigation into galaxies with very low rates of star formation , where the effects of star formation and accretion may be more easily distinguished .    to address this issue ,",
    "we have recently performed deep hi observations of the nearby dwarf spiral ngc 4395 .",
    "the data were obtained using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) for a total of @xmath0 .",
    "the target was chosen because it is nearby [ @xmath1 ; @xcite ] ; viewed at a moderately face - on inclination [ @xmath2 ; @xcite ] ; isolated ; and has a low optical luminosity , with localized star formation activity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : anomgas]b ) .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques in the ` miriad ` software package .",
    "subsequent analysis was performed using ` gipsy ` .",
    "inspection of the hi data cube reveals the presence of a large population of gas clouds at velocities which place them outside of the normal disk rotation . in total",
    ", approximately @xmath3 , equivalent to 5% of the total hi mass , is found to be in this component . here , we restrict ourselves to presenting a brief overview of the anomalous gas population ; we defer a more detailed analysis of the individual clouds to a forthcoming paper .    in order to distinguish the gas at anomalous velocities from the gas participating in normal disk rotation , a velocity field",
    "was constructed by tracing the peaks of the individual velocity profiles .",
    "next , the velocity profiles in each line of sight were shifted by the corresponding value in the velocity field , yielding a ` derotated ' data cube . in this cube , the peak hi emission is located ( by construction ) at @xmath4 . following a visual inspection of the derotated cube ,",
    "the gas outside of the somewhat conservative velocity range @xmath5 was called anomalous ( cf . the typical hi velocity dispersion , @xmath6 ) .    the global distribution of the anomalous velocity gas identified using the technique described above is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : anomgas]b .",
    "four of the larger gas complexes have been labeled ( a  d ) .",
    "complexes b ( @xmath7 ) , c ( @xmath8 ) , and d ( @xmath9 ) appear to be colocated with regions of active star formation , as suggested by the emission in the underlying galex fuv map .",
    "complex a ( @xmath10 ) on the other hand , appears to be unassociated with any of the actively star forming regions .",
    "it may be a signature of ongoing gas accretion onto the disk of ngc 4395 ."
