    "the use of the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) eigenstates of photons in quantum information science became attractive after it was shown , theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , that oam is conserved during spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc )  the azimuthal indices of a pair of down - converted photons add up to that of the pump beam . as a result ,",
    "the pair of down - converted photons are naturally entangled in terms of their azimuthal indices or oam .",
    "entanglement is a desirable property in quantum information applications , where it has been used in quantum ghost imaging @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite and in quantum computing algorithms @xcite .",
    "any transverse spatial modal basis defines an infinite - dimensional hilbert space , allowing more information per photon to be used in quantum information applications .",
    "although the laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) modes are currently the popular choice for theoretical analyses of quantum information systems based on oam , the modal basis used in quantum information experiments are seldom pure lg modes ; see ref .  @xcite .",
    "the optical manipulation and detection of lg modes requires control of the radial index , which governs the radial shape of each lg mode s intensity profile .",
    "we shall refer to the modes that are detected without this radial control as azimuthal modes .",
    "the azimuthal index is not associated with a unique quantum state , but with a subspace of the total hilbert space . if the radial part of the mode changes , a photon propagating through an optical system may suffer a loss of its quantum entanglement , even if the azimuthal index is unaffected .",
    "as the complexity of quantum information systems increases , the requirements for the fidelity of the quantum states can be expected to become more demanding .",
    "although the connection between the spatial modal profile of an optical beam and oam was initially made with specific reference to lg beams @xcite , the same property applies to any optical beam with a rotationally symmetric intensity profile . as a result",
    ", bessel beams @xcite and bessel - gaussian ( bg ) beams @xcite also have quantized amounts of oam associated with them .",
    "each photon in such a beam also carries an amount of oam equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the azimuthal index of the mode .    in this paper , we investigate the use of bg modes @xcite as a basis for photonic quantum information experiments . the radial index associated with lg modes is replaced by a continuous scaling parameter for the radial part of the bg modes . the relative ease and accuracy with which one can manipulate the azimuthal and radial dependencies of bg modes",
    "make them a favourable choice for high - fidelity quantum information systems .",
    "we compare the high - dimensional density matrices measured in the bg basis to those measured in the azimuthal basis .",
    "our results indicate that under the correct experimental conditions , the generation and measurement of high - dimensional entanglement in the bg basis is advantageous compared to the azimuthal basis .",
    "our results indicate a possible advantage in using bg modes over azimuthal modes for both generating and measuring oam entanglement .",
    "the electric field of a bg mode is given by @xmath2 where @xmath1 is the azimuthal ( mode ) index ( a signed integer ) ; @xmath3 is the bessel function of the first kind ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the transverse and longitudinal wave numbers respectively , obeying @xmath6 .",
    "the initial radius of the gaussian profile is @xmath7 and the rayleigh range is @xmath8 .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ bgm ] ) that the radial component of the mode can be scaled by altering @xmath4 .",
    "the quantum state for the photon pairs produced in spdc can be written in terms of bg modes , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the probability amplitude for measuring a signal photon in state @xmath11 and an idler photon in state @xmath12 .",
    "the radial scaling parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : biphoton ] ) can be adjusted in a continuous manner to optimize the bandwidth of the oam spectrum .",
    "for particular bg modes specified by @xmath4 , the two - photon state for @xmath15 dimensions can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath1 ranges over @xmath15 different values .",
    "the sets of @xmath1-values for different dimensions @xmath15 are chosen as in ref .",
    "the density matrix of a two - photon qu__d__it quantum state can be reconstructed in terms of a bloch representation , @xmath17 where @xmath18 are complex coefficients with @xmath19 for normalisation ; @xmath20 are the @xmath15-dimensional generalised gell - mann matrices for @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is the @xmath15-dimensional identity matrix .",
    "these coefficients are determined by performing a tomographically complete set of measurements .",
    "an example of an over - complete set consists of the bg states @xmath23 together with the superpositions of two bg states @xmath24 .",

    "the quantum state in eq .",
    "( [ equ : biphoton ] ) consists of two qu__d__its , which results in a @xmath26 density matrix and thus requires at least @xmath27 measurements to match the number of matrix elements @xcite .",
    "however , if an over - complete set of measurements is chosen , additional information is available to compensate for measurement errors due to natural photon number fluctuations .",
    "an uncertainty of @xmath28 was observed for the measured coincidence counts .",
    "our experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ fig : setup ] . a mode - locked laser source with a wavelength of 355 nm and an average power of 350 mw",
    "was used to pump a 0.5-mm - thick type i bbo crystal to produce non - collinear , degenerate entangled photon pairs via spdc .",
    "the plane of the crystal was imaged onto two separate spatial light modulators ( slms ) .",
    "the slms were used to select the particular pair of bg modes that were to be detected , as explained below .",
    "the slm planes were re - imaged and coupled into single - mode fibers to extract the pure gaussian modal components .",
    "the fibers were connected to avalanche photodiodes , which then registered the photon pairs via a coincidence counter .",

    "mm and @xmath32 mm , where the bg modes were selected .",
    "lenses @xmath33 mm and @xmath34 mm were used to image the slm planes through 10 nm bandwidth interference filters ( if ) to the inputs of the single - mode fibres .",
    "examples of a phase - only binary bessel hologram with a helical phase of @xmath35 for different values of @xmath4 are shown in ( b ) @xmath36  rad / mm , ( c ) @xmath37  rad / mm and ( d ) @xmath38  rad / mm .",
    "the inset shows a back - projected ccd image of a binary bessel mode with helical phase @xmath39 and radial wavevector @xmath37  rad / mm measured at the plane of the crystal . ]    in order to select bg modes using slms , we encode a binary bessel phase function to approximate the bessel function , thereby avoiding the need to perform complex amplitude modulation @xcite , which results in the loss of optical power .",
    "the binary bessel function is then combined with a helical phase function to determine the azimuthal index @xmath1 of the detected bg mode .",
    "the phase - only hologram used to project the photons into bg modes is given by the transmission function @xmath40 where sign@xmath41 denotes the sign - function .",
    "spatial filtering introduced in each of the detection arms can be used to remove the binary nature of the transmission function , causing the effective modes that are detected to be the bg modes . without the binary bessel function ,",
    "the transmission function is the same helical phase function that is traditionally used to measure the azimuthal modes .",
    "however , each oam mode with a particular value of @xmath42 is a superposition of different radial modes that have the same azimuthal index .",
    "the binary bessel function , which is encoded on the slms , enables us to select one particular radial mode from this superposition . as a result of selecting one radial mode ,",
    "we anticipate two notable features in the measured coincidence counts .",
    "firstly , the spiral bandwidth of the bg spectrum will change depending on the chosen radial mode . secondly , as only one radial mode from the superposition is selected , the coincidence count rate will be lower when the bessel function sign@xmath43 is included compared to when it is not .",
    "the shape of the spectrum will also change as a result of the binary bessel function , because one only measures the part ( one - dimensional slice ) of the full two - dimensional spectrum that corresponds to a particular value of @xmath44 .    following the method derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , we used superpositions of oam states with @xmath45 , in analogy to the polarisation states , to demonstrate the violation of a bell - type inequality .",

    "( [ eqn : super ] ) were oriented at angles @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the signal and idler photons , respectively .    using the method described in ref .",

    "we construct the density matrix so that it is both hermitian and positive semi - definite with unitary trace @xcite .",
    "this is necessary as the effects of statistical variations of the coincidence count rates and experimental inaccuracies commonly produce reconstructed density matrices with negative eigenvalues and a non - unitary trace .",
    "in the first experiment we vary the radial wave number @xmath44 on each slm and monitor the coincidence counts for each @xmath1 mode . for @xmath51 the phase functions on the slms consist of only the helical phase . as a result",
    "the @xmath51 measurements correspond to the conventional azimuthal modal spectrum .",

    "( b ) oam spectrum for azimuthal modes ( red ) and bg modes for @xmath37  rad / mm ( purple ) and @xmath38  rad / mm ( green ) , in terms of the modal weightings .",
    "the maximum coincidence count rate is lower for both bg modes , however a broader spectrum is observed with increasing @xmath4 . ]",
    "we observe almost a doubling in the oam bandwidth from @xmath36  rad / mm ( azimuthal modes ) to @xmath38  rad / mm ( bg modes ) .",
    "this tuneability in the radial component of the field allows for the oam spectrum to be customised through application of eq .",

    "the maximum coincidence count rate decreases for bg modes , but its spectrum is broader than that of the azimuthal modes .",
    "the full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) widths of the spectra indicate that the bg modal spectrum at @xmath38  rad / mm is almost twice as wide as the azimuthal modal spectrum obtained at @xmath36 .",
    "the wider bandwidth can be explained as an effect of the more selective measurement of the transverse spatial modes , thanks to the specification of the radial definition of the mode ( eq .  [ eqn : phase ] ) . as a result one observes a reduction in the central region of the spectrum .",
    "note that the reduction in the central region of the spectrum does not correspond to an attenuation over all radial modes , but rather to a more selective detection of a particular radial mode .",
    "the reduction in the central region of the spectrum makes procrustean filtering in higher dimensional entanglement experiments @xcite superfluous . beyond a certain @xmath1-value",
    "the bg spectrum coincides with the azimuthal modal spectrum .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of having a large @xmath1-value with a fixed width gaussian envelope :  the gaussian suppression of the function beyond a certain radius causes the definition of the radial dependence of the mode for large @xmath1-values to have little or no effect . although the spatial resolution of the slms would become a limiting factor , larger values of @xmath4 are expected to give oam spectra with larger bandwidths .",
    "the wider bandwidth allows more basis states to be incorporated in quantum information systems .     at positions @xmath54 ( blue ) , @xmath55 ( pink ) , @xmath56 ( green ) and @xmath57 ( yellow ) .",

    "clauser , horne , shimony and holt ( chsh ) provided a method to experimentally test bell s theorem , stating that no local hidden - variable theory could simulate the kind of statistical predictions made by quantum mechanics @xcite .",

    "we have successfully demonstrated that bg modes are entangled in the high - dimensional oam degree of freedom .",
    "crucially , the ability to select the radial component allows us to record bg states with a very broad spiral spectrum .",
    "the resulting high - dimensionally entangled states are closer to the appropriate maximally entangled state compared to the case where no radial selection is performed . such control of the experimental conditions results in a higher information capacity per photon pair and allows for more states to be utilized in quantum information processes .",
    "the only cost of the increased spiral spectrum of the recorded modes is a lower coincidence count rate , which is due to the required modal selectivity . due to the particular interference properties of bg modes ,",
