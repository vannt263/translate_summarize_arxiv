    "the landuaer formula for the oscillating part of the conductance is obtained from the ray tracing scheme shown in figure 2a of the main text . the transmission amplitude through the entire junction",
    "is taken to be a product of the transmission amplitudes at the two interfaces with a phase factor corresponding to the semiclassical phase accumulated between the junctions .",
    "this semiclassical phase difference for neighboring trajectories is @xmath66 where we take the real part to account for the fact that in general the classical turning points shift from their values of @xmath67 defined for @xmath18 , @xmath64 .",
    "in addition , there is a nonanalytic part of the phase associated with the the vanishing of the reflection coefficients at opposite interfaces  @xcite which can be nontrivial at finite magnetic field , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the step function ( @xmath70 for @xmath71 , @xmath72 otherwise ) .",
    "this phase jump is equivalent to a sign change in the reflection coefficient as the incidence angle crosses zero , and implies that the transmission probability at normal incidence is unity .    at a p - n junction ,",
    "assumed to be smooth on the lattice scale , the transmission amplitude is exponentially peaked about normal incidence .",
    "@xcite the principal effect of a weak magnetic field on the transmission through a single p - n junction is to modify the incident angle at the two junctions due to cyclotron bending of the trajectories .",
    "choosing the landau gauge where @xmath73 with @xmath31 the conserved transverse momentum in the center of the junction ( @xmath74 ) , the transmission and reflection amplitudes at the junctions located at @xmath26 are  @xcite      defining the total phase @xmath76 , and taking into account the damping , due to scattering , of the particle propagators between the junctions , we can write the landauer conductance of the heterojunction via the canonical fabry - perot formula as @xmath77    it is difficult to separate diffusive from ballistic effects in the bulk conductance . however , the contribution of diffusive effects to quantum interference effects are strongly suppressed at @xmath64 , rendering useful the definition @xmath78 , where @xmath79 denotes the conductance averaged over the accumulated phase .",
    "multiple reflections are suppressed both by the finite mean free path as well as the collimating nature of the junctions ; as @xmath80 , higher order products of transmission and reflection coefficients are necessarily decreasing . utilizing this fact , we can expand the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ gtot ] ) and subtract all nonoscillating terms to get the leading contribution to the quantum interference ,      this formula does not take into account inhomogeneities in the applied local gate potential due to the uneven width of the top gate or thickness and crystallinity of the dielectric .",
    "such disorder can lead to significant damping of the oscillations even in a completely ballistic sample  @xcite , and makes the estimate for the mean free path derived from matching the observed amplitude of the oscillations a lower bound .",
    "nevertheless , that the mean free path in the lgr is shorter than that in the gl is consistent with recent experiments ( unpublished ) which find a strong enhancement of the raman d - band in graphene after it is covered in hsq and irradiated with electrons at energies and doses comparable to those used during top gate fabrication .",
    "@xcite      the theoretical model described in the previous section takes as an input the potential profile across the heterojunction . in order to perform a quantitative comparison between experiment and theory , we first determine these parameters by numerical simulation of our device electrostatics using comsol multiphysics , a commercial finite element simulation software package .",
    "scanning electron microscopy images of the device chosen for the quantitative comparison show the top gates to be @xmath82  nm wide , while the capacitive coupling of the top gate is found to be @xmath83 .",
    "graphene is treated as a perfect conductor covered by 10 - 20  nm of hydrogen silsesquioxane ( hsq ) , with dielectric constant @xmath84 , and 20  nm of hfo@xmath45 , @xmath85 .",
    "we choose the dielectric constant of the hsq in each simulation to ensure a match between the calculated and measured capacitive coupling , determined as the relation between the applied top gate voltage and the maximal density reached in the lgr .",
    "the dielectric constant of atomic layer deposition ( ald ) grown hfo@xmath45 layer was consistent with a separate capacitance measurement on a similarly prepared thin film . for this range of sample parameters",

    "we note that the distance between pn junctions , which determines the boundary of integration in equation ( [ wkb ] ) , changes by a factor of two over the experimentally accessed density range , making the excellent quantitative fits obtained for the oscillation phase particularly convincing .",
    "[ [ quantitative - estimate - of - the - electric - field - at - the - p - n - interfaces ] ] quantitative estimate of the electric field at the p - n interfaces ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in this section , we compare the measured data ( fig .",
    "5a ) with numerical simulations to extract the strength of the electric field in an individual pn junction .",
    "it follows from robust semiclassical arguments  @xcite that , in the experimentally realized situation of p - n junctions smooth on the scale of the lattice constant , the collimation at an individual junction should be a gaussian function of @xmath31 ( see eq .[trans ] ) .",
    "the important parameter is the electric field , @xmath12 , in the junctions , which is given , after taking into account the absence of linear screening in graphene near the charge neutrality point , by  @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the density gradient across the junction . as is evident from the simulations ( fig .",
    "5b ) , the nonlinear screening correction to the electric field gives a better fit to the experimental data than either the non - exponential collimation produced by atomically sharp barriers  which appears to contain higher order resonances  or the weaker field that results from neglecting nonlinear screening near the dirac point .    to make this comparison more quantitative , we perform several simulations",
    "in which the nonlinear screening result , ( [ fogler ] ) , is scaled by some prefactor , @xmath95 . for a rough comparison",
    ", the linear screening corresponds to @xmath96 , while the step potential corresponds to @xmath97 .",
    "as explained in the main text , the magnetic field dependence contains an abrupt phase shift at finite magnetic field as the finite @xmath31 modes cease to contribute to the oscillations and @xmath18 modes  which carry with them the additional berry phase of @xmath30become the dominant contribution to the oscillatory conductance . with increasing magnetic field ,",
    "a fully ballistic model predicts the gradual ebbing of these phase shifted oscillations as the cyclotron radius becomes comparable to the junction size .",
    "the field at which the @xmath30-phase shift manifests is tied to the degree of collimation of the transmission at each p - n interface . because this phase shift is rather abrupt",
    ", we can define the transition magnetic field , @xmath39 , as the field at which the values of the the oscillation prefactor @xmath98 for zero and finite @xmath31 modes become comparable , giving @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath39 depends strongly on the junction electric field , it allows us to extract this field from the experimentally observed oscillation phase shift . defining @xmath39 as the field at which @xmath100 for fixed density @xmath1 such that @xmath101 is an extremum",
    ", we can estimate @xmath102 .    in accordance with the ballistic theory , the oscillations peak at zero magnetic field , and then have a second maximum after the phase shift at finite magnetic field .",
    "the relative height of these two maxima can be used to estimate the electric field @xmath12 .",
    "higher collimation suppresses the contribution of the modes near @xmath18 at finite @xmath42 , since this feature is entirely generated by modes not normally incident at either interface .",
    "higher collimation thus corresponds to an effectively more one - dimensional channel for interference effects , leading to the more effective destruction of the oscillations by the lorentz force , which serves to push the particles out of the narrower acceptance angles at each junction . by taking the average value of @xmath103 and comparing it with the simulations for a variety of values of @xmath95",
    ", we can extract @xmath1041.6@xmath105.3 .",
    "we note that the apparent discrepancy between this and the method previously outlined is likely due to the contribution of momentum non - conserving processes to the oscillations at finite @xmath42 , leading to an overestimate of @xmath95 .",
    "while neither of the methods above is free of systematic errors , they confirm the importance of nonlinear screening in determining transport through graphene p - n junctions .     and magnetic field at v@xmath59=50v .",

    "the width of the central region is adjusted to be 46 - 48  nm in the simulations in order to match the phase of the zero field oscillations .",

    "most of features discussed in text are present , including an oscillatory conductance that can be tuned be magnetic field . in this device , however , as in the majority of devices , the fabry - perot resonances appear to be mixed with other , irregular , conductance fluctuations .",
    "this behavior is most evident in the magnetic field dependence of the oscillations ( fig .",
    "6c ) : although the phase shift is still evident in some of the transmission resonances , several oscillation periods appear to be intermixed , and there is no adiabatic crossover to the shubnikov - de haas oscillations as observed in the high quality device discussed in the main text .",
    "in addition , we discovered that the more disordered heterojunctions devices exhibit transmission resonances even when the overall doping of the lgr was of the same sign as that in the gl ( fig .",
