    "recently a large amount of experimental results , ranging from infrared spectroscopy to transport properties involving the colossal magneto - resistance and high @xmath1 superconductivity , has pointed out the presence of polaronic carriers in doped cuprates and in the manganese oxide perovskites@xcite . in particular several experiments",
    "have shown that in doped perovskite manganites @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) there is a quite considerable coupling between the charge and the lattice degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "the lattice distortions associated with the @xmath4 ions play an important role in determining the electronic and magnetic properties of these compounds which have become the focus of the scientific interest after the discovery of the colossal magneto - resistance phenomena .",
    "recently it has been found that in @xmath5 the metallic phase is characterized by homogeneously distributed intermediate polarons while , above the transition from ferromagnetic metal to paramagnetic insulator , small and intermediate polarons coexist@xcite . also",
    "the measurements of the @xmath6 distances in @xmath7 crystal have pointed out , below @xmath8 , two conformations of the @xmath9 octahedra assigned to two different types of polarons@xcite .",
    "this large amount of experimental data has renewed the interest in studying the models of the electron - phonon coupled system and in particular the holstein molecular crystal model that , for his relative simplicity , is the most considered model for the interaction of a single tight - binding electron coupled to an optical local phonon mode@xcite .    for the holstein hamiltonian , beside the weak - coupling perturbative theory@xcite an analytical approach",
    "is known for the strong coupling limit in the nonadiabatic regime ( small polaron)@xcite .",
    "it is based on the lang - firsov canonical transformation and on expansion in powers of @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 being , respectively , the small polaron binding energy , the coordination lattice number and the bare effective hopping integral ( @xmath15 represents the ratio between the small polaron binding energy and the energy gain of an itinerant electron on a rigid lattice ) .",
    "it is well known that both these analytical techniques fail to describe the region , of greatest physical interest , characterized by intermediate couplings and by electronic and phononic energy scales not well separated .",
    "this regime has been analyzed in several works based on monte carlo simulations@xcite , numerical exact diagonalization of small clusters@xcite , dynamical mean field theory@xcite , density matrix renormalization group@xcite and variational approaches@xcite .",
    "the general conclusion is that the ground state energy and the effective mass in the holstein model are continuous functions of the electron - phonon coupling and that there is not phase transition in this one - body system @xcite . in particular when the interaction strength is greater than a critical value the ground state properties change significantly but without breaking the translational symmetry .",
    "recently , results for the holstein molecular crystal model have been presented by using the global - local variational method@xcite .",
    "the comparison of the data obtained in one space dimension with the known approaches has shown that these results seem to provide the best estimates of the polaron ground state energy .",
    "they are highly accurate over a wide range of the polaron parameter space , from the non - adiabatic to the adiabatic , from weak to strong coupling limit .",
    "nevertheless a solution of the global - local variational method for any particular @xmath16 value ( @xmath16 is the wave number of the polaron bloch state ) is obtained by minimizing with respect to a very large number of parameters , that depends on the number of lattice sites and that increases dramatically with increasing the number of space dimensions from one to three .    the aim of this work is to study the holstein polaron features including ground state energy , polaron energy band , shape of the lattice distortion induced by the electron - phonon interaction and spectral weight of the coherent polaron band within a new variational approach .",
    "it is based on two translationally invariant bloch wave functions that provide a very good description of the two asymptotic regimes , the weak and strong coupling regimes . in this paper",
    "these wave functions are called large and small polaron . in the large polaron wave function",
    "the phonon distribution function takes into account the average effect of the correlation among the emission of successive virtual phonons by the electron and the spatial extension of the polaron is large compared with the lattice parameter of the crystal . in the small polaron wave function the lattice polarization is confined to a region of the order of the unit cell and the polaron radius becomes of the order of the lattice constant . in this case",
    "all momenta of the brillouin zone contribute to the polaron wave function and in the phonon distribution function the effect of the electron recoil due to the emission of virtual phonons is negligible .",
    "a careful inspection of these two wave functions points out that , far away from the two asymptotic regimes , they are not orthogonal and that the off - diagonal matrix elements of the holstein hamiltonian are not zero .",
    "it is then straightforward to determine variationally the polaron ground state energy by considering as trial state the linear superposition of the large and small polaron wave functions .",
    "the comparison of our results with the monte carlo@xcite data and the ground state energies of the variational global local method@xcite shows that the proposed method provides a very good description of the polaron ground state energy for any value of the parameters of the holstein model and confirms the existence of three regimes@xcite : the weak coupling regime , characterized by polaron masses lightly heavier than the free electron mass and by dimension of the lattice polarization large compared with the lattice parameter ; the strong coupling regime where the well - known polaronic band collapse takes place and the intermediate regime that is characterized by the crossover between the small and large polaron solutions .",
    "this regime is , therefore , well described by a wave function that is a linear superposition of bloch states that describe the small and large polaron .",
    "we stress that the new variational approach provides a clear description of the holstein polaron features in any regime and involves , for any particular @xmath16 value , a very small number of variational parameters , that does not depend on the number of lattice sites .",

    "we construct translationally invariant bloch states by taking a superposition of the localized states ( [ 5r ] ) centered on different lattice sites in the same manner in which one constructs a bloch wave function from a linear combination of atomic orbitals .",
    "then the trial wave function that accounts for the translational symmetry is given by ( see also ref.17 ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45}|0>_{ph } \\label{13r}\\ ] ] and @xmath46    this wave function is a sum of coherent states in the phonon coordinates , one for any particular lattice site . since in a coherent state the emission of phonons occurs through a number of independent processes it is evident that in this trial state there is not correlation among the emission of successive virtual phonons .",
    "this physical assumption , i.e. that on every lattice site virtual phonons are emitted independently , is well - founded when @xmath30 is sufficiently large but it is questionable for intermediate and small values of the electron - phonon interaction where the electron recoil kinetic energy plays an essential role .",
    "moreover the wave function ( [ 12r ] ) does not contain states with real phonons .",
    "this indicates that the calculation of the polaron energy provides correct results only if the effective polaron band width @xmath47 and the phonon energy @xmath26 satisfy the condition @xmath48 .",
    "as it is well known , both these approximations limit the validity of the wave function ( [ 12r ] ) to the strong coupling limit .",

    "we note that if one neglects the spatial broadening of the electronic wave function , i.e. @xmath54 , the lang firsov approximation is recovered , i.e. the exact solution of the holstein molecular crystal model for @xmath55 .",
    "when the value of the adiabatic parameter @xmath0 decreases it becomes necessary to go beyond this approximation . in this paper",
    "we assume : @xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 are two variational parameters , @xmath59 is determined in such a way the eq.([7r ] ) is satisfied and @xmath40 and @xmath60 indicate , respectively , the nearest and the next nearest neighbours .",
    "this choice of the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 that takes into account the broadening of the electronic wave function in every lattice site to the nearest neighbours and to the next nearest neighbours allows to obtain a variational estimate of the ground state energy at @xmath61 that is lower than the result of the second order of the perturbation theory@xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath12 indicates the small polaron binding energy to the first order of the perturbation theory : @xmath63 and @xmath13 is the nearest neighbour number . in appendix the calculation of the polaron band within the ansatz ( [ 17r ] ) for the variational parameters @xmath53 is reported .",
    "we end this section noting that this method can be systematically improved by adding further terms in eq.([17r ] ) .",
    "this allows to obtain better and better estimates of the polaron energy in the strong coupling limit .    * the large polaron",
    "*    it is well known that when the value of @xmath30 is small the picture is quite different . as the electron moves through the crystal it exerts weak forces upon the ions which respond and move .",
    "this resultant ionic polarization will , in turn , modify the motion of the electron .",
    "then the particle must drag this polarization with it during its motion through the solid .",
    "this affects its effective mass that is weakly larger than that of a bloch electron@xcite . in this weak - coupling regime",

    "@xmath71 has the right translational symmetry , i.e. it is a bloch state with wave number @xmath72 .",
    "this wave function represents an electron dressed by the virtual phonon field that describes the ionic polarization .",
    "we note that the term in the square brackets of the eq.([21r ] ) allows a considerable advantage over the independent phonon approximation of lee , low and pines . in the lee ,",
    "low and pines ansatz an important physical ingredient is missing : it does not take into account the fact that the polaron energy can approach @xmath26 . on the contrary the wave function ( [ 20r ] ) contains this physical information@xcite .",
    "in particular when the polaron excitation energy becomes equal to the energy of a longitudinal optical phonon , the band dispersion flattens and becomes horizontal . for these values of @xmath72 the band has the bare phonon - like behaviour with very small spectral weight .",

    "the two wave functions ( [ 12r ] ) and ( [ 20r ] ) , describing respectively the small and large polaron , differentiate mainly for the expression of the phonon distribution function .",
    "it is evident that , in spite of the assumption of no correlation ( sum of coherent states in the phonon coordinate ) , the large polaron wave function takes into account the average effect of the correlation introduced by the electron recoil ( eq.[22r ] ) , effect absent in the small polaron phonon distribution function .",

    "in particular when the coupling constant is smaller than @xmath86 the stable solution ( the one with lowest energy ) corresponds to the large polaron while for @xmath87 it corresponds to the small polaron .",
    "crossing @xmath86 the mass of the polaronic quasi - particle increases in a discontinuous way@xcite .",
    "a more careful inspection shows that in this range of @xmath30 values the wave functions describing the two solutions of large and small polaron are not orthogonal and have non zero off diagonal matrix elements .",
    "this suggests that the lowest state of the system is made of a mixture of the large and small polaron solutions@xcite .",
