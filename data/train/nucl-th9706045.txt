    "the force between two nucleons is one of the fundamental problems in nuclear physics .",
    "experimentally , the two - nucleon force is mapped out in nucleon - nucleon scattering , which is a purely elastic process up to nucleon laboratory kinetic energies of @xmath4 mev , the @xmath5-threshold . since both the target and the projectile have spin-1/2",
    ", there is a rich spin - structure in nn - scattering .",
    "besides total and differential cross sections many independent spin - observables can be measured with polarized targets and/or projectiles . at present",
    "a huge body of nn - scattering data exists and this data base will increase and improve in the near future , in particular with experiments to be performed at the proton cooler facility cosy in jlich .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of the elastic nn - scattering data is done in terms of a phase shift analysis .",
    "the pertinent phase shifts are labeled by the spectroscopic notation @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the total spin , @xmath8 the total angular momentum and @xmath9 the orbital angular momentum of the two - nucleon system .",
    "the total isospin of the nn - system @xmath10 is readily determined by the pauli exclusion principle , which demands @xmath11 to be odd , in order to have an antisymmetric wave function in the combined isospin - spin - coordinate space .",
    "the spin - dependence of one - pion exchange ( longest range nn - interaction ) gives rise to a tensor interaction which causes a mixing of the ( triplet ) states with orbital angular momentum @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in order to quantify this effect a mixing angle @xmath14",
    "is introduced for each @xmath15 in addition to the singlet and the three triplet phase shifts .",
    "the empirical mixing angles @xmath14 are , however , small and do not exceed @xmath16 degrees up to the @xmath5-threshold .",
    "this weak mixing justifies the use of the spectroscopic notation @xmath6 which presumes @xmath17 to be a good quantum number .",
    "the single ( weakly ) bound state , the deuteron in the @xmath18-channel with total isospin @xmath19 , shows up as a pole in the nn - scattering amplitude ( on the physical riemann - sheet of @xmath20 ) slightly below threshold at @xmath21 mev , corresponding to minus twice the deuteron binding energy @xcite . in the @xmath22-channel with total isospin @xmath23",
    "the nucleon - nucleon potential is slightly too weak to form a bound state and a pole on the second riemann - sheet results @xcite , even much closer to threshold than the deuteron pole .",
    "both the true bound state deuteron and the `` anti - bound '' state on the second riemann - sheet slightly below threshold are responsible for the extraordinarily large s - wave nn - scattering lengths @xcite ( @xmath24 fm , @xmath25 fm ) and the rapid change of the s - wave phase shifts . in all other partial waves the energy dependence is much more moderate .",
    "p- and d - wave phase shifts change by at most @xmath26 from threshold up to the @xmath5-threshold at @xmath27 mev and f- and g - waves do not exceed values of @xmath28 in this energy range @xcite .",
    "thus with the exception of the two s - waves , the nucleon - nucleon interaction is actually rather weak in almost all channels .    an accurate description of the nn - scattering data and deuteron properties has been found in terms of the one - boson - exchange model ( obe ) and more refined the bonn - potential @xcite which includes multi - meson exchanges as well .",
    "the basic ingredients of the obe model are the one - pion exchange , the exchange of the vector mesons @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the exchange of a fictitious scalar isoscalar boson @xmath31 .",
    "the latter may be viewed as an effective description of correlated two - pion exchange in the isoscalar scalar channel .",
    "such an interpretation of the @xmath31 comes from the dispersion - theoretical studies of the two - pion exchange @xcite , which use the empirical information from the crossed @xmath32-scattering channel .",
    "the coupling constants of the vector and scalar mesons to the nucleon are adjustable parameters . for each meson - nucleon",
    "vertex a `` form factor '' of monopole - type with adjustable cut - off in the range 1 gev @xmath33 2 gev is introduced . in the obe model",
    "these form factors are needed to have convergent integrals in the lippmann - schwinger equation , which iterates the obe potential to infinite orders . even though the meson - nucleon form factors are often interpreted ( in analogy with the electromagnetic nucleon form factors ) in terms of nucleon substructure",
    ", they do not represent truely physical quantities .",
    "first , they can not be measured , and secondly they can not even be defined in a model independent way . as off - shell matrix elements they depend on the actual form of the interpolating meson field , which is not unique for a composite particle .",
    "putting aside the non - observability of meson - nucleon form factors , the obe - model works very well . with about a dozen free parameters one obtains accurate fits to nn - scattering data and deuteron properties @xcite .",
    "in recent years there has been activity to understand the nn - force in a more fundamental way from the symmetries of qcd , in particular from chiral symmetry which governs low - energy strong interactions . in his seminal papers",
    "weinberg @xcite discussed the qualitative implications of chiral symmetry for the two- and multi - nucleon forces .",
    "ordonez , ray and van kolck @xcite applied the chiral lagrangian to the two - nucleon problem . using time - ordered perturbation theory and a gaussian cut - off prescription to regularize loop divergences they calculated the two - pion exchange nn - potential .",
    "in addition more than 20 parameters related to short range nn - contact terms were introduced .",
    "the cut - off dependent potential was then transformed to coordinate space and used to solve the non - relativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "a good fit was obtained for the deuteron properties and the phase shifts in the low partial waves ( s , p , d ) up to kinetic energies of @xmath34 mev ( partly also up to @xmath35 mev ) @xcite .",
    "of course in the presence of nearly 30 fit parameters the role of chiral symmetry in the nn - interaction is obscured .",
    "furthermore , the use of a gaussian cut - off is not consistent with the chiral power counting scheme underlying the whole approach @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to explore the kinematical window in energy and angular momentum in which the nn - interaction is governed by chiral symmetry alone .",
    "our physical motivation comes from the simple fact that the range of the force produced by the exchange of a hadronic state is inversely proportional to its mass .",
    "the longest range part comes from one - pion exchange and chiral symmetry manifests itself via the smallness of the pion mass , a feature which derives from the fact that the pion is an approximate goldstone boson of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "the exchange of the next heavier hadronic state , consisting of two pions , is intimately related to @xmath36-scattering by crossing . in this reaction chiral symmetry",
    "leads to important dynamical constraints in the form of low - energy theorems @xcite , see also the recent work of @xcite , where many low - energy @xmath32-observables have been investigated in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "it is now interesting to explore the structure of the @xmath2-exchange nn - potential when it is produced by a @xmath32-interaction with all chiral constraints built in .",
    "naturally , one expects such an approach to work for the peripheral nn - partial waves where only the long and intermediate range components of the nn - force operate .    in the present work we calculate the chiral two - pion exchange based on the same chiral @xmath32-lagrangian as used in @xcite .",
    "our methods and aims are however different and complementary .",
    "first of all we will use covariant perturbation theory throughout and thus have to solve the problem of the so - called pinch singularity @xcite occuring in the planar box diagram .",
    "secondly , we use throughout dimensional regularization , a prescription to handle loop divergences which is in harmony with chiral symmetry and the chiral power counting scheme .",
    "thirdly , we stay within the systematic expansion of chiral perturbation theory and calculate in one - loop approximation all contributions to the nn t - matrix up to and including third order in small external momenta .",
    "consequently , we do not iterate to infinite orders . as a result",
    "we find that the phase shifts with @xmath37 and mixing angles with @xmath1 are given entirely parameterfree and thus allow for a rigorous test of chiral symmetry in the nn - interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly discuss the chiral @xmath32-lagrangian at next - to - leading order underlying our calculation . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the necessary formalism , the nucleon - nucleon t - matrix , the projection onto partial waves and the expressions for the perturbative phase - shifts and mixing angles . section 4 presents closed form analytical results for the one - pion and two - pion exchange contributions to the nn t - matrix calculated in one - loop approximation . in section 5 the parameterfree results for the peripheral phase shifts @xmath38 and mixing angles @xmath39 are discussed . in section 6",
    "we give explicit expressions for the irreducible two - pion exchange potentials in coordinate space and compare them with phenomenological ones . in section 7",
    "we compare the isoscalar central amplitude at zero momentum transfer with obe and finally section 8 ends with a summary . in the appendix",
    "the construction of the anti - symmetric nn t - matrix satisfying the pauli exclusion principle is given .",
    "the tool to investigate the dynamical consequences of spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking in qcd is the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "it provides a non - linear realization of the chiral symmetry group @xmath40 using the relevant low - energy effective degrees of freedom , the goldstone pions and the nucleons .",
    "the effective chiral @xmath32-lagrangian takes the following general form , @xmath41 where the superscript indicates the number of derivatives or small external momenta . in the heavy baryon formulation @xcite ( which essentially corresponds to a non - relativistic treatment of the nucleons ) the leading and next - to - leading order terms read @xcite , @xmath42 here , @xmath43 $ ] is the chiral covariant derivative acting on the iso - doublet nucleon field @xmath44 and @xmath45 is an axial vector ( matrix ) quantity",
    "the @xmath46-matrix @xmath47 collects the goldstone pion fields in the form @xmath48 with the pion decay constant @xmath49 mev .",
    "the only other parameter occuring in @xmath50 is @xmath51 , the axial vector coupling constant of the nucleon .",
    "since we are considering here exclusively the pion - nucleon vertex we employ the goldberger - treiman relation @xmath52 together with the empirical value of @xmath53 @xcite and therefore use @xmath54 throughout .",
    "@xmath55 mev is the ( average ) nucleon mass and @xmath56 mev the ( average ) pion mass .",
    "the second order lagrangian @xmath57 consists of two different types of terms .",
    "the first two terms in eq.(3 ) have coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 which are fixed by lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "the remaining set of chiral invariant terms are accompanied by new low - energy constants @xmath60 .",
    "these four low - energy constants have been recently determined at one - loop order in ref.@xcite from a fit to nine ( sub)threshold @xmath32-observables .",
    "their values are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , all given in gev@xmath65 .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite the @xmath66-resonance makes the dominant contribution to @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the exchange of a scalar boson with mass and coupling constant similar to the fictitious @xmath31 allows to explain @xmath69 and also part of @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath68 receives a significant contribution from @xmath29 vector meson exchange .",
    "note that the @xmath71 are much larger than the typical @xmath58-scale in eq.(3 ) .",
    "thus one expects the important @xmath2-exchange contributions to the nn t - matrix to be the ones proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "this completes the description of the effective chiral @xmath32-lagrangian .",
    "we are considering elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the initial and final nucleon momenta in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame with @xmath75 .",

    "each of these five components occurs in an isoscalar @xmath87 and an isovector @xmath88 version .",
    "note that , for the purpose of having projection formulas as simple as possible ( see eqs.(6 - 9 ) ) , we do not follow the usual conventions for the decomposition of @xmath89 in all cases . in particular , we associate the tensor term with the helicity structure @xmath90 in our decomposition . the overall sign of @xmath89 is chosen here as it follows directly from the feynman rules for the s - matrix , with a positive t - matrix , positive phase - shifts and a positive scattering length corresponding to attraction .",
    "we remark that eq.(4 ) is not just a non - relativistic approximation , but results from the evaluation of the fully relativistic nn t - matrix in the center - of - mass system when reduced to two - component spinors . in principle",
    "the nn t - matrix consists of the total sum of all direct diagrams and those with crossed nucleon lines . in practice",
    ", there is however no need to evaluate the diagrams with crossed nucleon lines , since the pauli exclusion principle gives a simple rule , namely @xmath91 being odd , to select the allowed nn - partial waves .",
    "therefore we identify here @xmath89 in eq.(4 ) only with the sum of all direct diagrams . in the appendix",

    "we evaluate the contributions at second and third order of the expansion in powers of small external momenta ( here @xmath80 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) .",
    "these contributions are divided into three classes : vertex and propagator corrections to one - pion exchange , irreducible two - pion exchange and iterated one - pion exchange .",

    "no pion - nucleon `` form factor '' is generated by any of these diagrams , neither at second nor at third order in the small momentum expansion .",

    "spin - orbit potentials in coordinate space ( accompanying the standard spin - orbit operator @xmath283 ) have a spectral representation , @xmath284 we find from chiral two - pion exchange the following isoscalar and isovector spin - orbit potentials , @xmath285 at @xmath243 fm these finite range two - pion exchange spin - orbit potentials are @xmath286 mev and @xmath287 mev .",
    "the isovector spin - orbit potential @xmath288 is very small and repulsive .",
    "however , the isoscalar spin - orbit potential @xmath289 from irreducible two - pion exchange is quite large and attractive and it turns out to be in very good agreement with the sum of the phenomenological @xmath31- and @xmath30-exchange contributions . in fig.12 , these spin - orbit potentials are shown for distances 1 fm @xmath249 2 fm .",
    "finally , we note that the expressions for the two - pion exchange spin - orbit potentials eq.(48,49 ) agree with the earlier calculation of ref.@xcite . actually , we agree on all terms with earlier calculations , except those proportional to @xmath290 coming from the planar box graph and contributing to the central , spin - spin and tensor potentials .",
    "this type of relativistic correction is only well defined if the relativistic correction to the iterated one - pion exchange is specified ( as done here in eq.(24 ) ) .    as a summary",
    "we find , that all irreducible two - pion exchange nn - potentials are of van - der - waals type .",
    "they show an asymptotic exponential behaviour , @xmath291 , with a decay length @xmath292 fm .",
    "near the origin @xmath293 they become singular as @xmath294 or @xmath295 .",
    "the strongly attractive parts of the potentials @xmath296 and @xmath172 below @xmath297 fm are responsible for the overestimate of the d - wave phase shifts and @xmath209 in fig.3 .",
    "wave - functions of d - states still probe to an appreciable amount the nn - potentials below @xmath298 fm , which in our calculation come out too strong in most cases . in order to improve the d - wave observables one has to add either repulsive zero - range counter terms or an explicit @xmath30-meson .",
    "finally , we have to spell out a warning in order to avoid confusion .",
    "the coordinate space potentials calculated here and the momentum space functions of section iib are not related through each other by ordinary fourier- and inverse fourier - transformation .",
    "both of them are too singular at @xmath293 or @xmath299 that these transforms would exist .",
    "the polynomial pieces @xmath300 ) of the momentum space functions generate potentials proportional to zero - range delta - functions and laplacians of delta - functions with divergent constants . on the other hand",
    "the fourier - transform of a potential as singular as @xmath294 or @xmath295 near the origin has a divergent polynomial piece in it . only in a loose sense , i.e. modulo zero - range @xmath301-terms and linear polynomials in @xmath156 , are the coordinate space potentials ( presented in this section ) and the momentum space functions of irreducible two - pion exchange ( section iib ) related by fourier - transformation . for the observables we have considered in this work , the phase shifts with @xmath37 and mixing angles with @xmath202 , these polynomial pieces and delta - function terms do not play a role at all , as we have mentioned repeatedly",
    "a detailed comparison between one - boson exchange and ( irreducible ) chiral two - pion exchange in momentum space is not really meaningful because of the different dependences on the momentum transfer @xmath111 .",
    "nevertheless , we find it instructive to compare at least the overall strengths of both , i.e. the values at @xmath302 , denoted by an overbar .",
    "these values at @xmath302 include also zero - range effects generated by irreducible chiral two - pion exchange .    for the isoscalar central part one finds from irreducible chiral two - pion exchange and @xmath246-exchange at @xmath302 , @xmath303 using @xmath304 and @xmath305 @xcite .",
    "the isoscalar central attraction produced by chiral two - pion exchange is stunningly close to the sum of the individually large phenomenological @xmath247-attraction and @xmath306-repulsion .",
    "note that the isoscalar central attraction due two - pion exchange is a chiral symmetry breaking effect @xmath307 .",
    "the following interpretation of the numerical result , eq.(50 ) , is tempting . in the chiral limit",
    "the phenomenological @xmath247-attraction and @xmath306-repulsion will cancel each other entirely . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that in this case , @xmath308 , the so - called pseudospin symmetry observed in nuclear shell model spectra , can be explained very naturally .",
    "this suggests a strong connection between chiral symmetry of qcd and pseudo - spin symmetry in nuclei . of course",
    ", more detailed and quantitative work is necessary to put this conjecture on a firm basis .",
    "we have also compared irreducible chiral two - pion exchange with obe in other channels .",
    "no clear relation between obe ( @xmath309 ) and chiral two - pion exchange can be deduced from this comparison .",
    "the physics behind both is also rather different . whereas the obe parametrizes effects of ( strongly ) correlated and resonant multi - pion exchange , the chiral two - pion exchange ( to one - loop ) involves only soft pions without self - interaction .",
    "in this work we have gone one step further in a model independent description of the low - energy nn - interaction .",
    "in addition to the one - pion exchange , which is known to dominate the high angular momentum partial waves , we have included two - pion exchange processes based on the most general chiral effective lagrangian . we have performed a one - loop calculation of the nn t - matrix using covariant perturbation theory and dimensional regularization throughout .",
    "we solved the so - called pinch singularity problem occuring in the planar box diagram by subtracting the iterated one - pion exchange proportional the nucleon mass @xmath131 .",
    "in fact we calculated here all one - loop contributions to the nn t - matrix at second and third order in the small momentum expansion .",
    "no pion - nucleon form factor is generated to modify the point - like one - pion exchange .",
    "restricting ourselves to peripheral nn - phases ( phase shifts with orbital angular momentum @xmath37 and mixing angles with @xmath202 ) the calculation does not involve a single adjustable parameter .",
    "this feature allows for a clean test of chiral symmetry in the two - nucleon system . comparing to existing nn phase shift analyses we find partial agreement in the d - waves up to @xmath310 mev but also appreciable deviations .",
    "in particular , we find that the isoscalar central attraction generated by chiral two - pion exchange is far too strong for distances 1 fm @xmath249 2 fm .",
    "this points towards the importance of shorter range effects in the d - waves .    increasing the orbital angular momentum",
    "@xmath17 the agreement between the chiral prediction and the data improves gradually also for larger energies up to the @xmath5-threshold , @xmath221 mev .",
    "there is indeed a kinematical window where chiral symmetry governs the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "examples for this are the mixing angle @xmath216 and the @xmath225 and @xmath226 phase shifts , where the chiral corrections close the sizeable gaps between the one - pion exchange approximation and the data . in the high angular momentum partial waves ( @xmath311 )",
    "we find a faster convergence to the one - pion exchange as obtained in the empirical nn phase shift analyses .",
    "the calculation presented here incorporates via one- and two - pion exchange the long and medium long range components of the nn - interaction in a model independent way .",
    "therefore we propose the chiral nn phase shifts with @xmath312 and mixing angles with @xmath313 to be used as input in a future nn phase shift analysis .",
    "this way one could find out whether the small differences to existing phase shift analyses are significant in a direct comparison with nn - scattering data , namely angular distributions of differential cross sections and polarization observables .    we have given explicit expressions for the isoscalar / isovector central , spin - spin , tensor and spin - orbit potentials in coordinate space generated by irreducible chiral two - pion exchange .",
    "they are of van - der - waals type with an exponential asymptotic behaviour , @xmath314 .",
    "the isoscalar central potential is about twice as attractive as the one of the @xmath31-boson in the bonn potential .",
    "contrary to expectations the two - pion isovector central potential is attractive , because the contribution of the box graphs is numerically dominant .",
    "the one - pion isovector tensor potential is reduced by the two - pion exchange contribution .",
    "the sum of both is in agreement with the phenomenological paris potential above @xmath315 fm .",
    "the two - pion exchange isoscalar spin - orbit potential is surprisingly close to the sum of the phenomenological @xmath31- and @xmath30-exchange contributions .",
    "it is needless to say , that the chiral approach to nn - interaction presented here can ( at the moment ) not substitute for the successful phenomenological models as a whole . in nuclear physics applications",
    "the low partial waves ( s , p , d ) are the more relevant ones and chiral symmetry may be of minor importance for these . a combination of chiral dynamics together with short range contributions e.g. from @xmath306-exchange might help and will be explored further .",
    "even though the ( direct ) nn t - matrix of the form eq.(4 ) is sufficient to calculate all observables it has one deficit .",
    "it does not incorporate the pauli exclusion principle and therefore it has non - vanishing matrix elements in the pauli - forbidden nn - states with even @xmath11 .",
    "this deficit is cured by subtracting the t - matrix which results from the exchange of the two out - going nucleon lines , @xmath316 \\,.\\ ] ] the exchange operation @xmath317 involves a left - multiplication with the isospin exchange operator @xmath318 , a left - multiplication with the spin exchange operator @xmath319 and a substitution @xmath320 and @xmath92 in the scalar functions @xmath321 . evidently , twofold application of the exchange operation @xmath317 is the identity operation , @xmath322 , and thus @xmath323 $ ] is indeed anti - symmetric .",
