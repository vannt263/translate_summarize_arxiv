    "in the past few years , high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) and above - threshold ionization ( ati ) from aligned molecules in strong laser fields of femtosecond duration have proven to be a powerful tool for resolving , or even controlling , processes in the subfemtosecond and subangstrom scale .",
    "for instance , one may employ hhg and ati in the tomographic reconstruction of molecular orbitals @xcite , and in the attosecond probing of dynamic changes in molecules @xcite .",
    "this is possible due to the fact that the physical mechanisms governing both phenomena take place in a fraction of the laser period , i.e. , within hundreds of attoseconds @xcite , and involve the recombination or the elastic scattering of an electron with its parent molecule @xcite .",
    "thereby , high - order harmonics or high - energy photoelectrons , respectively , are generated .",
    "thus , the spectral features are highly dependent on the spatial configuration of the ions with which the electron rescatters or recombines , and yield patterns which are characteristic of the molecule",
    ". furthermore , they also depend on the alignment angle of the molecule , with respect to the laser - field polarization .    due to their simplicity , in particular diatomic molecules have been investigated , and minima and maxima have been encountered in their hhg and ati spectra .",
    "such patterns have been observed both theoretically tdse2005,doubleslit , kb2005,kbk98,mbbf00,madsen , usach2006,usachenko , henrikdipl , kansas , pracl2006,morecl , dm2006,hbf2007 and experimentally @xcite , and have been attributed to the interference between high- order harmonics or photoelectrons generated at different centers in the molecule .",
    "they are , in a sense , the microscopic counterpart of those obtained in a double - slit experiment .",
    "furthermore , the energy positions of the maxima and minima depend on the alignment angle and on the internuclear distance and , additionally , reflect the bonding or antibonding nature of the highest occupied molecular orbitals in question @xcite .",
    "such features have been studied either numerically , by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) @xcite , or semi - analytically , by employing the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) kbk98,mbbf00,madsen , usach2006,usachenko , henrikdipl , kansas , pracl2006,morecl , dm2006,hbf2007 . in particular , in @xcite , the contributions to the yield from each molecular center have been singled out within a tdse computation .",
    "therein , it has been explicitly shown that the maxima and minima in the spectra are obtained due to the interference between contributions from different centers , in agreement with the double - slit model in @xcite .    specifically in the sfa framework",
    ", the transition amplitude can be written as a multiple integral , with a semiclassical action and slowly - varying prefactors .",
    "the structure of the molecule ( and thus its double - slit character ) can be either incorporated in the prefactors or in the action .",
    "the latter approach also takes into account processes in which an electron rescatters or recombines with a center in the molecule different from the site of its release @xcite",
    ".    an open question is , however , which types of electron orbits are responsible for specific interference features .",
    "for instance , are the dips and maxima originated by the interference between orbits in which the electron leaves and returns to the same center ( regardless of which ) , or between those in which the electron leaves one atom and recombines with the other ? on the other hand , it could also be that the interference patterns result from the combined effect of all such orbits , and one is not able to attribute them to specific sets .",
    "since the strong - field approximation is a semi - analytical method , and allows an immediate association with the classical orbits of an electron returning to its parent molecule , it appears to be an ideal tool for tackling this problem .",
    "this approximation , however , possesses several drawbacks .",
    "first , the sfa is gauge dependent , which leads to different pre - factors and action , depending on whether the velocity gauge or the length gauge is taken .",
    "second , even for a specific gauge , the precise expressions for the pre - factors are not agreed upon , and some of them lead to interference patterns which are in disagreement with the experiments , and with results from other methods @xcite .    the main objective of this work is to make a detailed assessment of the contributions and relevance of the different types of recombination scenarios to the above - mentioned interference patterns , within the strong - field approximation , for a diatomic molecule . throughout the paper , we approximate the strong , infra - red field by  a linearly polarized monochromatic wave @xmath0 , and consider a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao approximation ) . in general ,",
    "we consider that the electron reaches the continuum by tunneling ionization . as an exception",
    ", however , we also take an attosecond - pulse train superposed to the monochromatic wave atthhg2004,attati2005,fsvl2006,fs2006 .",
    "the attosecond - pulse train provides an additional pathway for the electron to reach the continuum , and , recently , has proven to be a powerful tool in order to control high - order harmonic generation @xcite and above - threshold ionization @xcite . in the context of the present work , it is a convenient way to avoid problems related to spurious potential - energy shifts .",
    "these shifts are present in the length gauge and artificially modify the potential barrier through which the electron tunnels .",
    "hence , they may lead to a questionable physical interpretation , what the relevance of the different sets of orbits to the patterns concerns .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ transampl ] , we discuss the strong - field approximation transition amplitude for high - order harmonic generation , starting from the general expressions ( sec .",
    "[ general ] ) , and , subsequently , addressing the specific situation of a diatomic molecule in the lcao approximation ( sec .",
    "[ diatomic ] ) .",
    "thereby , we consider the situation for which the structure of the molecule is either incorporated in the pre - factor , or in the semiclassical action , in the presence and absence of the attosecond - pulse train .",
    "when discussing the former case , we emphasize the role of the overlap integrals , in which the dipole moment and the atomic wave functions are localized at different centers in the molecule . in the latter case , we follow the model in ref .",
    "@xcite , for a purely monochromatic driving field , and our previous work @xcite when the attosecond pulses are present , very closely .",
    "subsequently ( sec . [ results ] ) , we investigate the interference patterns . finally , in sec .",
    "[ concl ] we summarize the paper and state our main conclusions .",
    "in general , the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) consists in neglecting the influence of the laser field when the electron is bound , the atomic or molecular binding potential when the electron is in the continuum and the internal structure of the system in question , i.e. , contributions from its excited bound states .",

    "the above - stated equation describes a physical process in which an electron , initially in a field - free bound - state @xmath11 , is coupled to a volkov state @xmath12 by the interaction @xmath13 of the system with the field .",
    "subsequently , it propagates in the continuum and is driven back towards its parent ion , with which it recombines at a time @xmath14 , emitting high - harmonic radiation of frequency @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( amplhhg ) , additionally to the above - mentioned assumptions , the further approximation of considering only transitions from a bound state to a volkov state in the dipole moment has been made . in the single atom case , this has been justified by the fact that the remaining contributions , from the so - called continuum - to - continuum \" transitions , were very small . for a discussion of the various formulations of the sfa see , e.g. , @xcite and in particular @xcite .",
    "due to the fact that it can be carried out almost entirely analytically , the sfa is a very powerful approach .",
    "it possesses , however , the main drawback of being gauge - dependent ( for general discussions see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , and for the specific case of molecules , ref .",

    "indeed , a field - free bound state @xmath18 in the length gauge would be gauge equivalent to the field - dressed state @xmath19 in the velocity gauge , with @xmath20.$ ] such a phase shift causes a translation @xmath21 on a momentum eigenstate @xmath22 hence , for field - free bound states in both gauges it leads to different dipole matrix elements @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "however , this ambiguity will always be present .",
    "indeed , in the literature , different results have been reported for molecular sfa computations in the velocity and in the length gauge @xcite . in recent , modified versions of the length - gauge sfa",

    "such a state is gauge - equivalent to a field - free bound state in the velocity gauge , and , physically , may be interpreted as a field - dressed state , in which the laser - field polarization is included @xcite . for hhg",
    ", one may proceed in a similar way , with the main difference that the dressing should also be included in the final state , with which the electron recombines . in the dressedmodified sfa , @xmath28 .",
    "we will now apply the sfa to a diatomic molecule . for this purpose",
    ", we will consider the simplest scenario , namely a one - electron system and frozen nuclei .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the molecular orbital from which the electron is released and with which it may recombine is a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao approximation ) .",
    "explicitly , the molecular bound - state wave function reads @xmath29where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the positions of the centers @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , and @xmath34 is a normalization constant . for homonuclear molecules , which we will consider here , @xmath35 .",
    "the positive and negative signs for @xmath36 correspond to bonding and antibonding orbitals , respectively . within this context ,",
    "there exist two main approaches for computing high - order harmonic spectra , which will be discussed next .",
    "the simplest and most widely used mbbf00,madsen , usachenko , morecl , kb2005,dm2006,jmocl2006 approach is to incorporate the structure of the molecules in the prefactors @xmath37 and @xmath38 and to employ the same action @xmath39 as in the single - atom case .",
    "the multiple integral in the transition amplitude ( amplhhg ) can then either be solved numerically , or using saddle point methods @xcite .",
    "the latter procedure can be applied for high enough intensities and low enough frequencies , and consists in approximating ( [ amplhhg ] ) by its asymptotic expansion around the coordinates @xmath40 for which @xmath41 is stationary .",
    "this implies that @xmath42 and @xmath43 in this paper , we employ the specific saddle - point approximations discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for a single atom placed at the origin of the coordinate system , this leads to the equations @xmath44 ^{2}=-2i_{p } , \\label{saddle1}\\]]@xmath45 = 0 , \\label{saddle3}\\]]and @xmath46 ^{2}. \\label{saddle2}\\]]eq .",
    "( [ saddle1 ] ) expresses the conservation of energy at the time @xmath47 at which the electron reaches the continuum by tunneling ionization .",

    "one obtains such a condition for a classical particle reaching the continuum with vanishing drift velocity .",

    "if the velocity gauge is taken , the above stated conditions hold for @xmath77 , instead of @xmath78 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the initial and final free - field sttes are not gauge equivalent , as discussed in sec .",
    "the remaining terms grow linearly with the projection @xmath79 of the internuclear distance along the direction of the laser - field polarization , and may lead to unphysical results @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "they are sometimes neglected in the integrals @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "there exists , however , no rigorous justification for such a procedure .",

    "such a process leads to a strong set of harmonics in the low - energy range of the spectra .",

    "in @xcite , we employed such a scheme to control quantum - interference effects for high - harmonic generation and above - threshold ionization for the single - atom case , within the sfa framework .",
    "our previous findings suggest that the probability of the electron reaching the continuum , in case it is ejected by the attosecond pulses , is roughly the same for all sets of orbits .",

    ", there was a set of very short orbits , which led to particularly strong harmonics .",
    "therefore , an attosecond pulse train superposed to a strong laser field is an ideal setup to avoid any artifacts due to modified tunneling conditions .    in @xcite , we have approximated the attosecond pulse train by a sum of dirac - delta functions in the time domain .",
    "this yields @xmath125where @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 denote the laser field frequency , the attosecond - pulse strength and the train temporal envelope , respectively .",
    "this approximation is the limiting case for a train composed of an infinite set of harmonics , and has the main advantage of allowing an analytic treatment of the transition amplitudes involved up to at most one numerical integration .",
    "furthermore , it is a reasonable asymptotic limit for pulses composed by a large high - harmonic set .",
    "we consider here @xmath129 which , physically , corresponds to an infinitely long attosecond - pulse train .",
    "clearly , the total field is given by @xmath130    we will now assume that the attosecond pulses are the only cause of ionization and that the subsequent propagation of the electron in the continuum is determined only by the monochromatic field . hence , @xmath131 and @xmath132 in eqs .",

    "[ atto2].(c ) ) .",
    "therefore , these results agree with the double - slit picture , which has been put across in @xcite .",

    "there is , however , a minimum near @xmath215 for the former case .    for the dressed length - gauge sfa , the above - stated features can be attributed to the fact that the condition for maxima and minima is now given by ( [ maxmin ] ) , with @xmath216 instead of @xmath217 the harmonic frequencies for which they occur can be easily obtained from condition ( [ saddle2 ] ) , and are given by @xmath218 /2 .",

    "( [ omegadress ] ) , and therefore are unrealistically high .",
    "the discrepancies between both yields stem from the form factors @xmath223 , which are gauge - dependent .",
    "one may , however , consider field - dressed states in the velocity gauge , which are gauge - equivalent to field - free states in the length gauge .",
    "this is achieved by applying the transformation @xmath224 $ ] in the initial and final length - gauge electronic bound states .",
    "this leads to a shift @xmath225 on a momentum eigenstate @xmath226 , which is exactly the opposite shift induced in the field - dressed length - gauge sfa .",
    "this shift has the main consequence that the interference condition ( maxmin ) now holds for @xmath227 , even in the velocity gauge .",
    "the results obtained employing such dressed states in the velocity - gauge sfa , depicted in fig .",
    "9 , are indeed very similar to those obtained using its field undressed , length gauge formulation .",
    "in fact , we have observed mainly quantitative differences , due to different prefactors @xmath228 @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that the transformation @xmath229 introduces the same additional potential energy shifts in the modified action as in the undressed length - gauge case .",
    "thus , the price one pays for recovering the correct interference conditions is the loss of a direct connection to simple classical models .",
    "the present results support the viewpoint that the maxima and minima in the high - order harmonic spectra of diatomic molecules are due to the interference of electron orbits finishing at different centers in the molecule .",
    "this seems to hold regardless of whether the electron has been released in one center at the molecule and recombines with a different center , or whether it is ejected and returns to the same center .",
    "such conclusions have been reached by employing modified saddle - point equations , within the strong - field approximation .",
    "these modifications lead to orbits involving different centers , and are a slightly more refined approach than the standard procedure of considering single - center saddle - point equations and modified prefactors .    in this framework",
    ", we considered that the electron has been ejected by tunneling ionization and by an additional attosecond - pulse train , and compared the similarities and differences from both physical situations . in the former case ,",
    "depending from which center the electron is leaving , it must overcome unequal potential barriers to reach the continuum , whereas in the latter case it is ejected with roughly equal probability . especially in the purely monochromatic case",
    ", we observed that the contributions from orbits starting at one of the centers , namely @xmath230 , were much larger than those from @xmath231 , due to a narrower potential barrier .",
    "in particular , there exist potential - energy shifts which are proportional to the electric field at the ionization time and the internuclear distance , which cause such differences .",
    "it is however noteworthy that the electron excursion times have been confined to the first half - cycle of the laser field .",
    "if the other half - cycle had been taken , the potential barrier would reverse and the contributions starting from @xmath231 would be more prominent .    the above - mentioned potential - energy shifts , however , do not possess a clear - cut physical interpretation .",
    "in fact , they are only present in the standard length - gauge formulation of the strong - field approximation , i.e. , if field - free bound states are taken when the electron is ejected and recombines , and are the source of several problems . for instance",
    ", they reflect the fact that the sfa is translation - dependent .",
    "moreover , due to their existence , it is difficult to establish an immediate connection between this approach and the classical equations of motion of an electron in the laser field .",
    "on the other hand , it seems that such shifts are necessary in order to obtain the correct energy position of the maxima and minima in the hhg spectra .",
    "in fact , an improved formulation of the sfa , in which the influence of the laser field is included in the electron bound states , restores its translation invariance , provides an unproblematic classical limit dm2006 , but yields incorrect energy positions for the interference patterns .",
    "this discrepancy is related to the fact that the field dressing alters the double - slit interference conditions ( [ maxmin ] ) .",
    "a similar absence of interference features has been reported very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , for hhg computations using a field - dressed version of the sfa in the length gauge .",
    "finally , when employing different gauges , from our results it is clear that the dressing of the initial and the final states plays a far more important role than the different interaction hamiltonians @xmath232 .",
    "if the dressing is applied consistently so that the the electronic bound states are gauge - equivalent , the interference patterns will remain the same .",
    "this is due to the fact that the interference condition ( maxmin ) will then remain invariant .",
    "for instance , the spectra obtained in the velocity - gauge sfa with undressed states are very similar to those computed in the length gauge with field dressed states .",
    "the same holds for the undressed length - gauge , and the dressed velocity - gauge sfa spectra . in the two former cases ,",
    "there is a breakdown of the interference patterns , as compared to the field - undressed length gauge sfa .",
    "however , such patterns can be restored in the velocity gauge , by dressing the electronic bound states appropriately .",
