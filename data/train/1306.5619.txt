    "<S> 52 months of accumulated observations by the large area telescope onboard the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ in the region of the supernova remnants g296.5 + 10.0 ( pks 1209 - 51/52 ) and g166.0 + 4.3 ( vro 42.05.01 ) are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> gev emission is detected coincident with the position of the sources at the @xmath0 5@xmath1 and 11@xmath1 levels above the background , respectively , for the best - fit spectral and spatial scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the gamma - ray spectrum of the sources can be described with a power - law in energy . </S>",
    "<S> g166.0 + 4.3 shows a soft gev spectrum while that of g296.5 + 10.0 is flat ( in the @xmath2 representation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the gamma - ray emission from the sources is explored . </S>",
    "<S> both leptonic and hadronic mechanisms can account for the high - energy emission from g296.5 + 10.0 , while a leptonic scenario is preferred for g166.0 + 4.3 . </S>"
