    "stochastic processes play an important role in all scientific fields dealing with systems that are subject to inherent or external random influences ( ` fluctuations ' ) . therefore , numerous methods and models have been developed for the description of stochastically behaving systems @xcite .",
    "the fields of application reach from physics @xcite over chemistry @xcite and biology @xcite to the economic and social sciences @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will focus on _ markovian _ stochastic processes which do not essentially depend on so - called _ memory effects _ so that correlations of present transitions with past states of the considered system ( except the last one ) can be neglected .",
    "we can distinguish _ cross - section oriented methods _ describing the temporal evolution of the _ distribution of states _ and _ longitudinal - data oriented methods _ delineating single stochastic _ trajectories ( time series)_. if one is confronted with a _ continuous state space _ the distribution of states is governed by the _ fokker - planck equation _ @xcite and corresponding trajectories follow the _ langevin equation ( stochastic differential equation ) _ @xcite .",
    "related methods exist for quantum mechanical systems @xcite . in the following",
    "we will concentrate on systems with a _",
    "discrete state space_. then , the distribution of states satisfies the _ master equation _",
    "@xcite whereas the corresponding time series are determined by _ random walk models _ @xcite and generated by means of _ monte - carlo simulations _ @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "an important relation between the distribution of states and the occurence probabilities of paths has been established which was called the ` contracted path - integral solution ' .",
    "however , during its numerical implementation , this relation turned out to be restricted to the infrequent case of pure _ birth processes _ ( uni - directional transitions ) , since it did not provide an analytical formula for paths with repeatedly visited states .",
    "therefore , this paper presents the non - trivial derivation of the missing occurence - probability formula for ` degenerate paths ' ( sec .",
    "the numerical implementation of the ` contracted path - integral solution ' is outlined in section iv . since the _ ` breadth - first ' procedure _",
    "@xcite is very inefficient with respect to computer time and memory ( even for a few system states only ) , our algorithm bases on the _ ` depth - first ' procedure _ @xcite .",
    "the suitability and correctness of this new numerical method is illustrated by an example concerning brownian motion .",
    "section v summarizes the results of the paper and discusses further fields of application .",
    "let @xmath0 be the discrete set of possible states of the considered stochastically behaving system .",
    "moreover , let @xmath1 represent the _ transition rate _",
    "( i.e. the transition probability per unit time ) for state changes from state @xmath2 to state @xmath3 . in the following",
    "we will assume that @xmath1 is time - independent .",
    "then , the _ master equation _ of the corresponding markovian stochastic process reads @xmath4 \\ , , \\label{master}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes the probability of the system to be in state @xmath6 at the time @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , we can consider the associated random walk .",
    "let @xmath8 be the state of the system at the initial time @xmath9 , and let @xmath10 denote the _ transition times _ at which the system changes its state from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding _ stochastic time series _ up to time @xmath7 with @xmath13 is @xmath14 and can be numerically generated by means of a _ monte - carlo simulation method _ @xcite .",
    "if we are interested in the statistical properties of longitudinal ( trajectory - related ) quantities belonging to the considered stochastic process , we need to evaluate a large number of time series with respect to certain characteristics .",
    "this is connected with a considerable computational effort . however",
    ", if one is not interested in the respective times @xmath10 at which the single transitions take place , but only in the _ path _ ( sequence of states ) which the system takes , this effort can be very much simplified .    in order to illustrate this , let @xmath15 be the path which the system takes up to the time @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath16 is the probability of changing from state @xmath11 to @xmath12 between time @xmath10 and @xmath17 and that @xmath18 with the _ departure rate ( overall transition rate ) _",
    "@xmath19 is the _ ( survival ) probability _ with which the system stays in state @xmath12 for a time interval ( the _ survival time _ ) @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore , multiplying the probability @xmath22 of the initial state @xmath8 with the survival probabilities as well as the probabilities of the transitions involved and , afterwards , integrating with respect to the possible survival times @xmath23 , we obtain the _ occurence probability _",
    "@xmath24 with which the system takes the path @xmath25 up to the time @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27 here , the @xmath28-function guarantees that the survival times sum up to the available time @xmath29 . inserting its laplace - representation @xmath30\\ ] ] with a suitable constant @xmath31 and carrying out the integrations with respect to the survival times @xmath23",
    ", we finally obtain the formula @xcite @xmath32 where we have introduced the abbreviation @xmath33 with the kronecker function @xmath34 .",
    "it is obviously much easier to calculate formula ( [ explicit ] ) than to count and evaluate a huge number of stochastic trajectories .",
    "however , for this calculation we must first evaluate the integral by means of the _ residue theorem_. if all departure rates @xmath35 are identical ( i.e. @xmath36 ) , we get @xmath37 whereas we obtain @xmath38 with @xmath39 if the departure rates @xmath35 are pairwise different from each other .",
    "however , serious problems arise in deriving a general result for cases where _ different _ departure rates @xmath35 occur , but some of them _ multiple _ times .",
    "in the following , we will call paths for which _ some _ departure rate @xmath35 occurs twice or more often _ degenerate paths_. note that all paths with repeatedly visited states are degenerate !    for this reason let @xmath40 be the _ multiplicity _ of the departure rate @xmath35 in path @xmath25 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "then we have the relation @xmath42 , and formula ( [ explicit ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath43 where we have changed the integration direction . applying the residue theorem",
    ", we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 . introducing the functions",
    "@xmath46 we can represent ( [ repre ] ) in the form @xmath47 for @xmath48 we can derive the recursive relation @xmath49 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{-1}{m } \\bigg [ \\bigg ( \\sum_{l=0\\atop ( w_l \\ne u)}^n   \\frac{1}{w_l - u } - \\tau \\bigg ) p_{m-1}(u,\\tau ) +   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u } p_{m - 1}(u,\\tau ) \\bigg ] \\ ,",
    ". \\label{recurs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this shows that @xmath48 is a polynomial in @xmath29 of order @xmath50 since a comparison with ( [ exp2 ] ) provides us with @xmath51",
    ". however , formula ( [ recurs ] ) is not very suitable for a numerical implementation or a derivation of the explicit form of @xmath48 . in order to evaluate ( [ poly ] ) , we try to find the @xmath52st derivative @xmath53 of @xmath54 .",
    "since we would not succeed with the usual procedure , we need a trick and take the ` detour ' over the first derivative @xmath55 the @xmath56st derivative of this relation can now be determined as usual : @xmath57 here , we have used the definitions @xmath58 and @xmath59 formula ( [ recursiv ] ) obviously allows to express the derivatives @xmath60 in terms of derivatives @xmath61 of lower order @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , we insert for @xmath61 again relation ( [ recursiv ] ) , etc .",
    "after a couple of iterations this procedure leads , for @xmath63 , to @xmath64 where we have separated the terms containing @xmath65 from the rest and omitted the arguments @xmath66 of the functions . in equation ( [ in ] )",
    "we have to apply the convention @xmath67 if @xmath68 ( as will be shown by fig .",
    "1 ) . consequently",
    ", the term with the @xmath69th derivative @xmath70 does not give a contribution to @xmath71 , since @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the final result @xmath76 for @xmath77 . the correctness of this formula is illustrated by fig . 1 .",
    "in refs . @xcite it has been proved that the solution @xmath5 of master equation ( [ master ] ) can be represented in the form @xmath78 with @xmath79 . according to ( [ pathint ] )",
    ", the probability @xmath80 to find state @xmath6 at the time @xmath81 is given as the sum over the occurence probabilities @xmath24 of all paths @xmath25 which have an arbitrary length @xmath82 but have led to state @xmath83 within the time interval @xmath29 .",
    "when ( [ pathint ] ) is evaluated numerically , one must restrict the summation to a finite number of _ relevant _ paths . here , we will define a path @xmath25 to be relevant if it fulfils the condition @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the _",
    "mean value _ of the _ occurence times _ of path @xmath25 and @xmath86 their _ variance _ ( cf .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 is a measure for the _ accuracy _ of the above outlined approximation . according to our experience",
    ", @xmath88 usually guarantees a reconstruction of @xmath89 of the probability distribution @xmath5 which can be checked by means of the _ normalization condition _ @xmath90 .",
    "an _ efficient _ implementation of the approximate ` contracted path - integral solution ' on a serial computer bases on the path - search procedure _ ` depth - first ' _ @xcite . after each step of this standard procedure which extends the previous path @xmath25 by an additional state @xmath91 ( leading to the path @xmath92 )",
    "the following quantities are calculated and stored in a so - called _ ` linked list ' _ @xcite : @xmath93 and @xmath94 if condition ( [ cond ] ) is fulfilled , the occurence probability @xmath24 is calculated according to formula ( [ form ] ) and added to @xmath95 . afterwards , the next step of the ` depth - first ' procedure is carried out .",
    "the path @xmath96 is not further extended if @xmath97 .",
    "this implies that the path @xmath96 and all longer paths @xmath98 which include @xmath96 as subpath are irrelevant .",
    "then , the procedure traces back its path @xmath96 one step before it tries to extend the previous path @xmath25 by another state @xmath99 .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the approximate ` contracted path - integral solution ' for the example of _ brownian motion _ which is characterized by nearest - neighbor transitions with the following transition rates : @xmath100",
    "in this paper we were able to derive an analytical formula for the occurence probability of arbitrary paths including the complex case of repeatedly visited states and/or equal departure rates .",
    "this allows a numerical implementation of the ` contracted path - integral solution ' of the discrete master equation .",
    "other kinds of path - integral formalisms have been developed for _ chaotic mappings _",
    "@xcite , the _ schrdinger equation _ @xcite , the _ fokker - planck equation _ @xcite , and also the _ master equation _ @xcite .",
    "the importance of the occurence - probability formula goes far beyond the new solution method for the master equation .",
    "it considerably simplifies the evaluation of the trajectories related with random walk models .",
    "therefore , a simulation program for the calculation of the occurence probabilities of paths , the path - integral solution , most probable paths , and first - passage times has recently been developed at the university of stuttgart .",
