    "two of the major concerns in the study of agns are the origin of the gas which fuels the nuclear black hole and the mechanisms responsible for making the gas lose angular momentum and move from galactic scales down to the inner @xmath41 pc region of the galaxy . in spiral galaxies , gas in their disks can be a natural source to fuel the agn .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested to explain how it is possible to transport gas from the disk of a spiral galaxy to its nucleus , like interactions ( gunn 1979 ; noguchi 1987,1988 ; hernquist 1989 ; barnes & hernquist 1992 ) , or bars ( schwartz 1981 ; norman 1987 ; shlosman , frank & begelman 1990 ) . in the case of elliptical galaxies",
    "the situation is more complicated , because they only have small quantities of gas , which implies that the gas which feeds their nuclei most likely has an origin external from the galaxy .",
    "reviews about this subject , with detailed explanations of the possible mechanisms responsible for feeding the nucleus are given by shlosman et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and combes ( 2001 ) .",
    "the influence of interactions on the fueling of the nucleus of agns as well as hii galaxies has been the topic of several studies . from the theoretical point of view and n - body simulations ,",
    "noguchi ( 1987,1988 ) , hernquist ( 1989 ) , barnes & hernquist ( 1992 ) , byrd et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , byrd , sundelius & valtonen ( 1987 ) , lin , pringle & rees ( 1988 ) , hernquist & mihos ( 1995 ) , mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) , taniguchi & wada ( 1996 ) , among others , have shown that interactions between galaxies , mergers , and minor mergers can be responsible for bringing gas from the disk to the nuclear region , where it is shocked and compressed , producing a starburst and subsequently feeding the nucleus . this idea is qualitatively confirmed with observations , but the models still have to explain fine details .",
    "it is a well established fact that luminous galaxies , in particular luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies are closely related to interacting systems ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; lawrence et al . 1989 ; leech et al . 1994 ; gallimore & keel 1993 ) .",
    "it has also been shown by keel et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , wright et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1987 ) that interacting galaxies have a higher level of h@xmath0 , infrared and radio emission , as well as an increased nuclear star formation rate .",
    "however , in the case of lower luminosity sources , like seyfert galaxies , the situation is not so clear .",
    "there is no consensus on how important is the effect of interactions in the feeding of their nuclei , and if these galaxies have an excess of companions .",
    "stauffer ( 1982 ) was one of the first to point out that seyferts usually occur in groups .",
    "dahari ( 1984 , 1985 ) made a large compilation of possible companion galaxies around seyferts .",
    "he found that these galaxies have an excess of companions relative to normal galaxies .",
    "although this result have been confirmed by several other studies ( rafanelli , violato & baruffolo 1995 ; laurikainen et al .",
    "1994 ; mackenty 1989 , 1990 ) , there have been some claims to the contrary .",
    "fuentes - williams & stocke ( 1988 ) , bushouse ( 1986 , 1987 ) , ulvestad & wilson ( 1984 , 1985 ) and de robertis , yee & hayhoe ( 1998 ) did not find a detectable excess of companions around seyferts .",
    "other studies of seyfert galaxies have shown yet another result , where seyfert 2 s have a larger number of companions when compared to normal galaxies , while seyfert 1 s do not ( laurikainen & salo 1995 and dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "similarly , in a study of galaxies with activity types other than seyfert , pastoriza et al .",
    "( 1994 ) showed that galaxies in high and low density media have similar stellar populations , while telles & maddox ( 2000 ) found that low redshift hii galaxies are , on average , found in slightly lower density environments than normal field galaxies .",
    "taylor et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found a different result , but according to telles & maddox ( 2000 ) this can be due to the fact that the progenitors of hii galaxies are different from those of field galaxies .",
    "the different results obtained by different papers are most likely due to the way they selected their samples and control samples , as pointed out by heckman ( 1990 ) and osterbrock ( 1993 ) . in order to do a proper comparison between the percentage of active , normal and hii galaxies with companions",
    ", it is necessary to have a sample of active galaxies and a control sample with matching host galaxy properties , which may have been a problem in the earlier studies .",
    "another problem with these studies is that they usually did not have information about the redshifts of the companion galaxies . in most of the cases ,",
    "the only information available was the magnitudes of the possible companions and their projected distances to the galaxies being studied .",
    "this means that these companions may not necessarily be physically associated .",
    "the way around this problem was to apply statistical corrections for the number of background and foreground objects around the galaxies being studied .    here",
    "we try to solve these problems by studying the percentage of companion galaxies in the palomar survey ( ho , filippenko & sargent 1997a ) .",
    "we will address problems related to the selection of the sample , control sample , and the availability of redshifts for the companions galaxies",
    ". we will also be able to study the percentage of companion galaxies in galaxies of different activity types , not only seyferts and normal galaxies as done in previous papers .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way .",
    "section 2 presents the sample and corresponding subsamples , while section 3 gives the techniques and data used .",
    "section 4 presents the comparison of local galaxy densities for galaxies of different activity types , and section 5 shows the comparison of the percentage of companions in these galaxies as a function of different properties ( e.g. morphological type , h@xmath0 luminosity ) .",
    "section 6 presents the discussion of the results and the summary .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section , one of the main problems for the previous works in this subject was the selection of the active and corresponding control samples of galaxies .",
    "here we solve this problem by using the galaxies in the palomar survey ( ho et al .",
    "this sample is ideal for this kind of study , because it contains the galaxies brighter than b@xmath5 mag in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the relative advantages of this sample relative to others is discussed by ho & ulvestad ( 2001 ) .",
    "they also point out selection biases which affect other samples commonly used in the literature . here",
    "we summarize the advantages of the palomar survey .",
    "the most important characteristic of this sample is the fact that it provides homogeneous high - quality spectroscopic measurements of emission line fluxes , as well as activity classification of the galaxies .",
    "another of its advantages is the fact that it covers a large range of agn and hii luminosities , as well as a large range of host galaxy parameters , like morphological types and absolute magnitudes , besides the fact of being large enough to ensure a significant comparison between galaxies of different activity types as a function of these parameters .",
    "since we are going to compare the percentage of galaxies with companions among different activity types , not only seyferts and normal galaxies , this sample is ideal for this work , because it includes both the agn and control sample in itself , allowing us to determine the frequency of galaxies with companions in the local universe , avoiding the selection effects faced by previous works .    the initial sample studied by ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) contained 486 galaxies .",
    "however , we decided to exclude local group galaxies according the list from mateo ( 1998 ) , because it includes a large number of low luminosity dwarf spheroidals .",
    "galaxies with b@xmath6 mag , which were included in their survey for historical reasons , or because they were interesting objects , have also been excluded .",
    "this gives a total number of 451 galaxies , divided into 46 seyferts , 193 hii galaxies , 88 liners , 63 transition objects and 61 absorption line galaxies .",
    "transition objects are galaxies which present emission line ratios intermediate between those of hii galaxies and liners , and absorption line galaxies are those without any detectable emission lines .",
    "other galaxies in this sample had emission line ratios which resulted in different classifications , depending on the emission line ratios used .",
    "they were classified by ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) as l2/s2 , or s2/h for example , and in these cases we used the first of the two classifications .",
    "given the small number of seyferts and liners with broad emission lines in the sample , we do not attempt to analyze these galaxies separately . nevertheless , we point out that schmitt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have shown , using a well defined sample of seyfert galaxies , that there is no significant difference in the percentage of seyfert 1 s and seyfert 2 s with companion galaxies .",
    "a statistical comparison of the emission line and host galaxy properties of these galaxies as a function of activity type was presented by ho , filippenko & sargent ( 1997b ) .",
    "it should be noticed that most of the galaxies classified as hii nuclei present only low levels of current star formation , with h@xmath0 luminosities similar to those of individual giant hii regions . due to this fact ,",
    "the lower luminosity hii galaxies should be considered as quiescent galaxies and not as starburst .",
    "we used two different techniques to compare the environments of the different types of galaxies .",
    "the first one used the local galaxy densities defined by tully ( 1988 ) , @xmath7 , and compared the galaxies in the different activity classes using the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( ks - test ) .",
    "@xmath7 is the density of galaxies brighter than m@xmath8 mag in the vicinity of the object of interest .",
    "this value was calculated by tully ( 1988 ) , using all galaxies in the local universe with distances smaller than 40  mpc , taking into account completeness effects .",
    "the values used in this paper were obtained from table 10 of ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , and cover 92% of the sample .",
    "the second technique searched for companions around the galaxies using ned and the digitized sky survey images ( dss ) .",
    "several parameters have been used to determine if a galaxy has a companion or not .",
    "we adopt here a slightly modified version of the one used by rafanelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which was determined based on catalogs of interacting and pair galaxies .",
    "we consider a galaxy as a companion if its distance to the galaxy of interest is smaller than 5 times the diameter ( d@xmath9 ) of that galaxy , the difference in brightness between them is smaller than 3 magnitudes ( @xmath10 3 mag ) , and the difference in radial velocities is smaller than 1000 km  s@xmath2 ( @xmath11 1000 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "we will call the galaxy around which we search for companions the primary and the companion galaxy secondary .",
    "the original parameters used by rafanelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) considered only secondaries at a distance smaller than 3 times the diameter of the primary .",
    "we decided to increase this value to 5 times the diameter of the primary",
    ". we will show below that this different criterion does not make a significant difference in the results .",
    "we emphasize that these criteria used to search for companions around the galaxies are simply empirical , corresponding to the range of properties found in galaxy pairs .",
    "according to charlton & salpeter ( 1991 ) , pairs with velocity differences smaller than 150 km  s@xmath2 are likely to be bound .",
    "however , the galaxies do not need to be bound in order to interact , the interaction can happen between galaxies which are not gravitationally bound .",
    "based on the magnitude criterion alone , we can calculate that , for an m@xmath12 primary galaxy , with m@xmath13 ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) a secondary galaxy 3 mag fainter will have m@xmath14 , a value between that of the lmc and the smc , which have m@xmath15 mag and m@xmath16 mag , respectively .",
    "the lmc and smc magnitudes were calculated using the values from mateo ( 1992 ) and the distance moduli obtained by cioni et al .",
    "this shows that the search for companions will not be biased towards bright galaxies only .",
    "the most luminous galaxy in the sample is ngc4594 , which has m@xmath17 , and the search for companions around this galaxy will consider only the galaxies with absolute magnitudes of the order of m@xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "the faintest galaxy in the sample is ngc404 , which has m@xmath19 and companions to this galaxy could have luminosities as faint as m@xmath20 which is a value typical of dwarf spheroidal galaxies like fornax and leo ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) .",
    "most of the galaxies in the sample have m@xmath21 ( ho et al",
    ". 1997b ) , which means that our criteria will select only secondaries with absolute magnitudes similar to that of the smc .",
    "lower luminosity dwarf / spheroidal and irregular galaxies , like the ones on the local group , will be missed .",
    "it was suggested by de robertis et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that mergers of gas - rich disk galaxies with satellite companions ( dwarf galaxies ) may be an important way to trigger the activity in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the data and criteria used in this paper does not allow us to test this hypothesis .",
    "it may be possible to do such a search in the future , using results from the sloan survey .",
    "one of the problems with previous studies was the fact that they were usually not able to obtain redshifts of the supposed companion galaxies . due to this fact they had to rely on statistical methods to determine the probability of two galaxies being companions , as well as to correct for the number of background and foreground galaxies based on galaxy number counts .",
    "since we cut our sample at b@xmath5 mag , the faintest secondary galaxies must have magnitudes b@xmath22 mag . in this way we are sure that most of the galaxies will have redshift information .",
    "redshift surveys , such as the cfa ( huchra et al .",
    "1983 ) observed galaxies as faint as @xmath23 , while the cfa2 ( falco et al . 1999 ) is observing galaxies up to @xmath24 .",
    "approximately 90% of the sample have been covered by redshift surveys .",
    "to ensure we did not miss any galaxy without radial velocity information , for those galaxies without known companions , according to our criteria , we checked ned for possible secondary galaxies without radial velocity information around the primaries , and also visually inspected the dss images for secondary galaxies up to 3 mag fainter than the primary galaxies .",
    "we did not find any possible secondary galaxy without radial velocity information .",
    "we also checked if the search of galaxies on the dss was able to detect low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "according to krongold , dultzin - hacyan & marziani ( 2001 ) the dss images have a surface brightness limit of @xmath25  mag  pixel@xmath2 , which , for pixels with a size of 1.7@xmath26 , corresponds to @xmath27  mag  arcsec@xmath28 .",
    "most of the low surface brightness galaxies detected by impey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have b band central surface brightnesses of the order of @xmath29 mag arcsec@xmath28 or fainter , effective radii r@xmath30 and effective surface brightness @xmath31 mag arcsec@xmath28 . using the equations from impey , bothum & malin ( 1988 )",
    ", we have that the integrated magnitude of an exponential disk galaxy can be calculated by m@xmath32 , which for a galaxy with @xmath33 mag arcsec@xmath28 and r@xmath30 corresponds to m@xmath34 .",
    "consequently , most of the low surface brightness galaxies will be fainter than b@xmath3515.5 , which is the faintest magnitude for our companion galaxies .",
    "this means that we did not miss a significant number of low surface brightness galaxies in the search for companions on the dss images .",
    "table 1 presents the galaxies for which we could find companions .",
    "this table is separated in 5 parts , according to activity type .",
    "it presents the names of the primaries , the magnitude differences between the primaries and the secondaries , the distances between them in units of the primary diameter , the moduli of the difference between the radial velocities and the names of the secondaries .",
    "we also present in this table the h@xmath0 luminosities of the primaries , whether they are ellipticals , s0 s or a later type galaxies and comment if they are members of the virgo cluster .",
    "we consider as late types , galaxies which have morphological types sa or later .",
    "this morphological separation is based on the fact that elliptical galaxies have very little or no internal gas , s0 s have some gas , while galaxies of morphological type sa and later have gas in their disks which can feed the nucleus or form stars .",
    "we point out the fact that two of the galaxies in table 1 , ngc4041 and ngc4564 , have a secondary at a distance larger than 5d@xmath9 .",
    "we consider these two galaxies interacting because their secondaries are much larger then them and their distances are smaller than 5 diameters of the secondary .",
    "in fact , the secondaries also are in the palomar sample",
    ".    one possible problem which could exclude secondary galaxies from our sample is the case of edge - on galaxies , which can be highly reddened and thus result in a magnitude difference larger than 3 mag .",
    "low mass starbursting galaxies can also create a selection bias , since the starburst would make them brighter and they would be considered as a secondary . however , these effects are expected to affect galaxies of all activity types , and given the size of the sample , they should be smeared out , since adding or subtracting one galaxy with a companion will not change the statistical results significantly .",
    "another effect which can influence the results in the case of broad lined seyfert galaxies , is the contribution from the nucleus to the integrated magnitude of their hosts . to correct for this effect we used the observed nuclear b magnitudes given by ho & peng ( 2001 ) .",
    "we found that this effect is negligible for most of the galaxies in the sample , with the exception of ngc4151 , where the nucleus increases the integrated magnitude by @xmath36 mag .",
    "we consider that this effect is also minimal for broad lined liners , since their nuclear continuum emission at optical wavelengths is weak ( ho 1999a ) .",
    "figure 1 presents the distribution of the modulus of the difference between the radial velocities of the primary and secondary galaxies .",
    "we can see that although we considered as companions two galaxies with @xmath37 km s@xmath2 , @xmath3870% of the pairs have velocity differences smaller than 300 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this number increases to 90% for velocity differences smaller than 500 km s@xmath2 .",
    "figure 1 also presents the distribution of radial velocity moduli of the sample of galaxy pairs from karachentsev ( 1987 ) .",
    "the visual inspection of the two groups of galaxies shows that they have similar distributions , indicating that most of the galaxies with @xmath37 km s@xmath2 in the palomar are real pairs .",
    "the ks test confirms this result , giving a 14% probability that two samples drawn from the same parent population would differ as much as these two samples .",
    "the total number of galaxies in each one of the subsamples as well as the number of galaxies with companions , percentage of companions and corresponding 1@xmath39 uncertainties are given in table 2 . in this table",
    "we also show these numbers for the cases when we exclude the galaxies which are members of the virgo cluster from the sample , and the results obtained from spliting the activity groups into subgroups of galaxies with different morphologies , or h@xmath0 luminosities .",
    "this section presents the comparison of the local galaxy densities , @xmath7 , of galaxies with different activity types .",
    "this measurement , defined by tully ( 1988 ) , gives the density of galaxies brighter than m@xmath8 around the galaxy of interest , thus it is an estimate of their environments .",
    "these values are tabulated by ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .    comparing the different activity classes , without excluding any galaxies , the ks test shows that , with the exception of absorption line galaxies , there is no statistically significant difference between their @xmath7 distributions . in the case of absorption line galaxies ,",
    "the ks test shows that their @xmath7 distribution usually is different from that of other types of galaxies at the 1% significance level .",
    "these results can be seen on the top left panel of figure 2 , where we show the percentage of galaxies , of a given activity type , as a function of log(@xmath40 ) .",
    "the analysis of the different distributions shows that absorption line galaxies are skewed towards higher density regions , due to the fact that @xmath3850% of them are in the virgo cluster .",
    "in fact , once we compare only those galaxies which are not members of the virgo cluster ( top right panel of figure 2 ) , there is no statistically significant difference in the @xmath7 distributions .",
    "the same result is obtained if we compare only the galaxies which are members of the virgo cluster .",
    "this test was repeated separating the galaxies according to their h@xmath0 luminosities .",
    "we found that comparing only the galaxies with h@xmath0 luminosities smaller , or larger than 10@xmath41 erg s@xmath2 gives essentially the same result , that the @xmath7 distributions of most types of galaxies are not significantly different .",
    "the corresponding log(@xmath40 ) percentage distributions are presented in the middle panels of figure 2 left for l(h@xmath0)@xmath42 erg s@xmath2 , and right for l(h@xmath0)@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 . notice that absorption line galaxies are not included in this comparison because they do not have emission lines . only in the comparison between liners and hii galaxies with l@xmath43 erg s@xmath2",
    ", we find a difference in the @xmath7 distribution , with the ks - test showing a 2% probability that two samples drawn from the same parent population would differ as much as these two samples .",
    "this result is due to the fact that these hii galaxies are found , on average , in slightly lower galaxy density regions than the liners .",
    "this result is due to a difference in the morphological types of these two groups of galaxies , since hii galaxies are found only in spirals , while a considerable portion of liners are in ellipticals , which are found in higher density environments .",
    "we discuss this effect in more detail in the next section .",
    "a similar result was obtained when we separated the galaxies by morphological type , again without a significant difference in the @xmath7 distributions , which can be seen in the bottom left panel of figure 2 for early type galaxies ( ellipticals and s0 s ) and bottom right panel for late type galaxies ( later than s0a ) . only in the comparison between liners and absorption line galaxies in early type systems ,",
    "we find a 1.4% probability that two samples drawn from the same population would differ as much as these galaxies .",
    "this result is due to the fact that almost all absorption line galaxies are early type systems , approximately half of them are in the virgo cluster and consequently have higher local galaxy densities .",
    "another test done using the local galaxy density estimator was to compare , for galaxies of the same activity type , if there was any difference in the @xmath7 distributions when we compare galaxies of early and late morphological types , or for l@xmath43 and @xmath42 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "again we did not find any significant difference , indicating that galaxies with the same activity type , but different morphological types , or luminosities are found in similar environments .",
    "this section shows the results of the comparison between the percentage of galaxies with companions among different activity classes . besides separating the galaxies according to their activity types ,",
    "we also split them based on membership to the virgo cluster , morphological type and h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "the comparison between the different types of galaxies is done using contingency table analysis ( press et al .",
    "1993 ) , which is a measure of association for two distributions . given the number of galaxies with and without companions in two of our subsamples ( e.g. seyferts and liners ) , this analysis gives the probability of any of these measurements being correlated .",
    "figure 3 shows the percentage of galaxies with companions as a function of the distance between the primary and the secondary , in units of the primary diameter ( d@xmath9 ) .",
    "although it would be ideal to plot the uncertainties of the percentage of galaxies with companions in the figures , this would result in extremely dense figures , with a large amount of lines superposing each other , which would be very difficult to understad .",
    "instead of doing this , we give the percentages , together with the corresponding 1@xmath39 uncertainties in table 2 . each panel in figure 3 shows a different range of magnitude differences between the primary and secondary galaxies .",
    "we can see that , besides the fact that the percentage of galaxies with companions is smaller for smaller magnitude differences between the primary and the secondary , the distributions do not differ too much for different @xmath44 values .",
    "the most noticeable effect in this plot is the fact that for magnitude differences of @xmath45 mag , there are no seyfert galaxies with companions .",
    "the analysis of figure 3 shows that , contrary to what previous papers have shown , seyfert and hii galaxies are the ones with the smaller percentage of companion galaxies . on the other hand , liners , transition and absorption line galaxies have the larger percentage of companions .",
    "in particular , the frequency of liners with companions is almost twice that of seyferts and hii galaxies .",
    "the results of the comparisons presented below are summarized in table 3 .",
    "this table presents the probability that the null hypothesis , that there is no correlation between the two quantities being compared , is correct .",
    "this probability is calculated based in @xmath46 statistics .",
    "we consider that there is an excess of companions in galaxies with a given activity type relative to another , only if the contingency table analysis gives a probability smaller than 5% .",
    "this means that the null hypothesis , that there is no correlation , is rejected at the 2@xmath39 level .",
    "the contingency table analysis confirms that seyferts have a smaller percentage of companions when compared to liners , with only a 3.3% probability , that the null hypothesis can be accepted .",
    "a similar result is obtained for hii galaxies , which have only a 0.2% probability of having the same percentage of companions as liners , and 1.6% when compared to absorption line galaxies .",
    "all other combinations of different subclasses have similar percentages of companion galaxies within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "we also tested whether considering galaxies as companions only if their distances are smaller than 3 times the diameter of the primary , the original rafanelli et al .",
    "( 1995 ) criterion , would give a different result .",
    "we find that , in most of the cases , it only reduces slightly the probability of two samples having the same percentage of companion galaxies , from 3.3% to 0.6% in the case of the comparison between seyferts and liners , from 0.2% to 0.001% for liners and hii galaxies , from 6.5% to 2.4% for transition and hii galaxies , from 7.7% to 10.5% for seyferts and absorption galaxies , and from 1.6% to 1% for hii and absorption galaxies .",
    "this same test was done for all the comparisons presented below , with similar results for 3 and 5 diameters , so , hereafter we will discuss only the results obtained when considering distances smaller than 5 diameters of the primary .",
    "as we did in section 4 , for the comparison between the local galaxy density distributions , here we repeat the analysis presented above excluding the galaxies which are in the virgo cluster .",
    "we do this because these galaxies are in a higher density environment , and consequently have a higher probability of having close companions .",
    "since @xmath3850% of the absorption line galaxies are in virgo , a much higher proportion than for the other activity classes , this can influence the results .",
    "figure 4 presents , in a similar way to figure 3 , the percentage of galaxies , which are not members of the virgo cluster , with companions .",
    "the results are very similar to those obtained when we do not exclude the virgo cluster members ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the only difference is that now liners do not have a significant excess of companions when compared to seyferts ( 6.5% ) , which is also the case for the comparison between hii and absorption line galaxies ( 7.2% ) .",
    "we still find a significant excess of companions when we compare liners to hii galaxies , with a probability of only 0.04% that these two subsamples are similar .",
    "another test done to the sample was to separate the different activity types into subgroups , based on their host galaxy morphological types .",
    "we decided to separate the galaxies into ellipticals , s0 s , and late type galaxies , those with morphological types sa and later .",
    "this division was based on the fact that late type galaxies have enough gas in their disks , and an interaction can easily move this gas into the nuclear region . in the case of elliptical galaxies , the amount of gas is much smaller , so the source of gas to feed their nuclei may have to be external to the galaxy . in s0 galaxies",
    "the amount of gas is larger than that of ellipticals , so we test whether combining these galaxies with ellipticals or late types makes a difference to the results .    in the comparison between the percentage of companions in elliptical galaxies of different activity classes",
    ", we do not include hii galaxies and seyferts , because there are no hii galaxies in ellipticals and only a small number of seyferts with this morphology .",
    "similarly , when analyzing the late type galaxies we do not include absorption line objects .",
    "the results of the separation of the sample into ellipticals , late types , early types ( ellipticals plus s0 s ) , and late types plus s0 s is presented in figure 5 . in the case of early types",
    ", there is no significant excess of companions among most of the galaxies studied .",
    "the comparison between the late type galaxies shows that all different activity classes have similar percentages of galaxies with companions .",

    "a similar result is obtained when we add late types and s0 s , with the exception that in this case liners have a slightly higher percentage of companions when compared to hii galaxies , but the probability that the two distributions are similar is 4.8% , only marginally significant .    an interesting result which comes out of the analysis of figure 5 ,",
    "is the fact that liners and transition galaxies in ellipticals have @xmath42 times higher a percentage of companions than the corresponding galaxies in late type systems . in the case of liners ,",
    "the probability of the two samples being the same is 0.4% . for transition objects this result is not statistically significant , given the small number of transition galaxies in ellipticals .",
    "this result is maintained when we compare early ( e@xmath47s0 ) and late type liners , but in this case the probability of the two samples being the same is 4% .",
    "the results of separating the sample into galaxies with h@xmath0 luminosities smaller or larger than 10@xmath41 erg s@xmath2 is presented in figure 6 .",

    "the comparison of seyferts and hii galaxies does not show a significant difference ( 11% ) .",
    "this result is again due to the mixture of ellipticals and spirals in the liners and transition galaxies samples .",
    "if we consider only spiral galaxies ( s0 s + late types ) with l(h@xmath0)@xmath3 erg s@xmath2 , we find that there is significant difference between the percentage of companion in these galaxies and hii galaxies .",
    "the comparison of galaxies with l@xmath43 erg s@xmath2 shows that there is no statistically significant difference in the percentage of galaxies with companions among different activity classes .",
    "the comparison between liners and seyferts shows a small probability that they have similar percentages of companions , 5.9% , but this can be due to the small number of seyferts .",

    ". however , there is a significantly higher percentage of galaxies with companions in the case of hii galaxies with l(h@xmath0)@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 , than in hii galaxies with l(h@xmath0)@xmath42 erg s@xmath2 , rejecting the null hypothesis at the 2.9% significance level .",
    "this result agrees with the ones presented by bushouse ( 1986 ) , keel et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and kennicutt et al .",
    "it also agrees with the result obtained by ho , filippenko & sargent ( 1997c ) , who found , in this sample , that hii galaxies in barred early type hosts have higher h@xmath0 luminosities .",
    "in fact , the percentage of hii galaxies with companions increases to @xmath3865% for galaxies with l(h@xmath0)@xmath49 erg s@xmath2 , a total of 9 out of 14 galaxies with companions .",
    "this percentage is significantly higher than that of the rest of the hii galaxies , as well as all the other galaxies in the sample , rejecting the null hypothesis at the 0.007% and 1.5% significance levels , respectively .",
    "the previous section shows that a simple analysis , not taking into account morphology or activity level ( h@xmath0 luminosity ) of the galaxies , gives that the percentage of liners , transition and absorption line galaxies with nearby companions is significantly higher than that of seyferts and hii galaxies .",
    "this result contradicts all previous works in this field , which either found that seyferts and hii galaxies have the same percentage of companions as other galaxies , or that they have a higher percentage of companions .",
    "however , we show that when we take into account the morphological types of the galaxies and split them into subgroups containing only ellipticals and only spirals , the situation is different .",
    "there is no difference in the percentage of galaxies with companions among different activity types if we consider only galaxies of similar morphological types .",
    "this result is consistent with the one found by fuentes - williams & stocke ( 1988 ) , bushouse ( 1986 , 1987 ) , de robertis et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and also with more recent results on clustering of low luminosity agns at higher redshifts ( brown et al . 2001 ; schreier et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the percentage of elliptical galaxies with companions is approximately two times higher than that of spirals .",
    "this explains why liners , transition and absorption line galaxies have higher percentages of companions when all galaxies are considered , since a higher percentage of these galaxies is found in ellipticals when compared to seyferts and hii galaxies .",
    "given the fact that most of the hii galaxies in the palomar sample have only small quantities of recent star formation , most of them should be considered as normal , quiescent galaxies .",
    "we found that a there is a higher percentage of galaxies with companions among hii galaxies with l(h@xmath0)@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 then in lower h@xmath0 luminosity hii galaxies .",
    "the percentage of companions increases even more for hii galaxies with higher h@xmath0 luminosities , which confirms previous results ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1997 , keel et al . 1985 , bushouse 1986 ) .",
    "the results we obtained separating the galaxies by morphological types is somewhat expected .",
    "it was shown by dressler ( 1980 ) and whitmore , gilmore & jones ( 1993 ) in the study of clusters of galaxies that the percentage of ellipticals increases in higher density environments .",
    "although this result was based on clusters , postman & geller ( 1984 ) found that the results also apply for groups of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , whitmore et al . (",
    "1993 ) found that the percentage of ellipticals in close pairs is higher than that of spirals , supporting the results we found .",
    "charlton , whitmore & gilmore ( 1995 ) showed that ellipticals are found more often in pairs than spirals in clusters and high density environments , like large groups .",
    "we found that @xmath430% of the ellipticals in our sample are in the virgo cluster , while only 20% of the spirals are found in virgo .",
    "another @xmath430% of the ellipticals are found in groups of galaxies with 10 or more galaxies garcia ( 1993 ) , suggesting that the higher percentage of ellipticals with companions is in fact due to the morphology - density relation .",
    "the study of the local galaxy densities ( section 4 ) shows that , in most of the cases , the distribution of this quantity does not differ for different activity types . in the cases where we find significant differences ,",
    "they can be explained if we exclude the galaxies which belong to the virgo cluster , or if we separate the galaxies into different morphological types .",
    "these results agree with the ones obtained in the comparison between the percentage of companions in galaxies with different activity types .",
    "it can be argued that the results found for seyfert galaxies is somewhat questionable , since the palomar survey has a large portion of low luminosity seyfert galaxies , which are usually not observed in other surveys . in this way , the results presented here would be biased towards low luminosity seyferts , which , in a way similar to hii galaxies , may have a higher percentage of companions as the luminosity increases .",
    "evidence of this effect is given by heckman , carty & bothun ( 1985 ) , heckman et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and hutchings ( 1983 ) , who showed that radio galaxies and quasars are found in higher density environments .",
    "we believe that this is not the case .",
    "we compare the results presented here with the ones from schmitt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for warm infrared seyfert galaxies .",
    "the median [ oiii ] luminosity of their seyfert galaxies , which is believed to be an isotropic indicator of the intrinsic luminosity of these galaxies , is l([oiii])@xmath50 erg s@xmath2 , calculated using de grijp et al .",
    "( 1992 ) values .",
    "this value corresponds to 70 times the median value of the [ oiii ] luminosity of seyfert galaxies in the palomar survey ( l([oiii])@xmath51 erg s@xmath2 ) , obtained from ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "schmitt et al . ( 2001 ) observed that between 19% and 28% of their seyfert galaxies have companions .",
    "their criteria were a little different from ours , assuming that galaxies were companions if the distance between the primary and the secondary was smaller than 3 times the diameter of the primary , and the brightness difference between them smaller than 3 mag . since it was not possible for them to find radial velocities for all possible companion galaxies ,",
    "they could only put limits on the percentage of galaxies with companions .",
    "the lower limit is 19% , which corresponds to those galaxies where it was possible to confirm that the companion has a radial velocity difference smaller than 1000 km  s@xmath2 , while the upper limit is 28% , corresponding to all galaxies , including those without information about the velocity of the secondary .",
    "the uncertainty in these measurements is @xmath45% , given by poisson statistics .",
    "the number of seyfert galaxies with companions at distances smaller than 3 diameters in the palomar survey is 8 in a sample of 46 galaxies , a total of 17%@xmath52% .",
    "given the uncertainties involved in these measurements , there is no significant difference in the percentage of seyfert galaxies with companions in the palomar and schmitt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) samples , which shows that low and high luminosity seyfert galaxies similar environments .",
    "the contingency table analysis gives that there is a 16% probability that the two samples have the same number of companions .",
    "the explanation of why other papers found that there is a higher percentage of seyferts with companions than normal galaxies with companions is not very clear .",
    "one possibility would be that they mixed galaxies of different morphological types .",
    "however , the percentage of seyferts in ellipticals is small and this effect could be smeared out in a larger sample .",
    "another explanation is related to the way the previous works selected their samples of seyferts . in the case of laurikainen & salo ( 1995 ) and dultzin - hacyan et al .",
    "1994 ) , their samples included a large portion of seyferts selected from ultraviolet surveys . in seyfert 2 galaxies ,",
    "the unified model predicts that the ultraviolet emission is either nuclear radiation reflected towards the observer ( antonucci 1993 ) , or a circumnuclear starburst ( cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 ) .",
    "if the seyfert 1 s and seyfert 2 s have the same amount of ultraviolet excess , this means that the seyfert 2 s were selected from two orders of magnitude higher in the luminosity function , since only 1% of the nuclear light is believed to be reflected , or that their circumnuclear region is dominated by a luminous starburst which is responsible for most of the ultraviolet emission ( see schmitt et al .",
    "2001 for a discussion about this ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the fact that these papers observed a higher percentage of seyfert 2 s with companions , but not seyfert 1 s , would be due to the fact that the percentage of starbursts with companions goes up as the starburst luminosity goes up , as shown above .",
    "the result that seyfert galaxies have the same percentage of companion galaxies as galaxies with other activity types is intriguing and may have important consequences for the theories of how the gas is moved from kiloparsec scales to the inner parsec region of the galaxy and feeds the nuclear black hole .",
    "taken at face value , this result indicates that interactions are not important in this process .",
    "however , this result can be interpreted in a different way . since we expect a delay between the time when the interaction occurs and when the gas reaches the nucleus , we may be seeing different stages of this process .",
    "it has been shown by several simulations ( e.g. byrd et al .",
    "1986 , 1987 , byrd & valtonen 2001 , lin et al .",
    "1988 , hernquist & mihos 1995 ) that interactions move the gas to the nuclear region of the galaxy , where its density and temperature increases , a starburst is formed and later the gas feeds the black hole . also , taking into account the evidence that many galaxies have black holes in their nuclei , suggesting that this may be the case in all galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 , ho 1999b , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , it may be possible that all galaxies pass through a period of activity .",
    "the galaxies may also pass through different activity types , where they first present a star formation period , when the gas has just moved into the nuclear region , later they present a period of seyfert activity , when the gas is being accreted by the black hole , and finally they go into a period where they turn into a liner or transition galaxy , when the amount of gas available to fuel the nucleus is small .",
