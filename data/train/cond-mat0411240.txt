    "in this paper we describe a new theory for the structure and thermodynamics of ionic fluids based on a generalization of the local molecular field ( lmf ) theory we have successfully applied to nonuniform simple fluids.@xcite a basic step in the lmf theory is the replacement of longer ranged and slowly varying parts of the intermolecular interactions by an appropriately chosen effective single particle potential . the structure and thermodynamics of the resulting reference system with shorter ranged intermolecular interactions in the presence of the effective field",
    "is then related to that of the original system of interest .",
    "this strategy seems particularly appropriate for ionic systems since at long distances the coulomb interaction is weak and very slowly varying , and systems with short ranged interactions are significantly easier to treat by theory or simulations .",
    "however coulomb interactions can be very strong and rapidly varying at short distances .",
    "a key question we address is how to divide the coulomb interaction into `` short '' and `` long '' ranged parts so that the lmf theory can give accurate results .",
    "its answer allows for the first _ controlled _ use of the lmf approximation , and we find exceptionally accurate results , even better than those found earlier for fluids with short ranged interactions .",
    "although the most physically interesting applications of these ideas are probably to nonuniform mixtures of size and charge asymmetric ions , in this initial discussion we consider a uniform _ one component charged hard sphere system _ ( occhs ) where almost all the ideas in the lmf theory can be seen in their simplest form .",
    "@xcite the occhs is made up of ( say positively ) charged `` ions '' comprised of hard spheres with a diameter @xmath1 with embedded positive point charges in the presence of a uniform neutralizing background .",
    "the only nontrivial correlations are between the positive ions and for most purposes we can think of this as a one component system with very long ranged repulsive interactions .",
    "a special case is the _ one component plasma _ ( ocp ) where there is no hard core ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "nothing in the theory makes essential use of the simplifications in the occhs .",
    "generalizations to nonuniform and asymmetric models are straightforward in most cases , and equally good results have been found .",
    "we first discuss the qualitative ideas leading to the lmf equation . these will be further developed and made more precise in our discussion of the occhs .",
    "the simplest application of lmf theory relates the structure and thermodynamics of a nonuniform system of interest with a spherically symmetric pair potential @xmath3 in an external field whose value at any point @xmath4 is @xmath5 to those of a _ reference system _ with a shorter ranged pair interaction @xmath6 in a renormalized effective field @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is supposed to be chosen to take account of the averaged effects of the _ perturbation potential _",
    "@xmath9 , where @xmath10    this separation of the intermolecular interaction @xmath11 into two parts can be done in an infinite number of ways , and any choice of @xmath12 defines a possible associated reference system . however the averaging procedure leading to the simple lmf theory can be expected to give very accurate results only for certain properly chosen _ slowly varying _ @xmath12 .",
    "figure 1 gives examples of separations of the repulsive coulomb potential we will use in this paper , parameterized by an important length scale @xmath0 . as explained in detail in section [ sec : lmfocchs ] , when @xmath0 is chosen larger than some state - dependent minimum size @xmath13 , the coulomb perturbation @xmath12 is sufficiently slowly varying that the lmf theory can give very accurate results .",
    "this is the crucial step in developing a simple and accurate theory for ionic systems .",
    "we will refer to the resulting special reference systems with properly chosen @xmath0 as `` mimic systems . '' in realistic models of ionic solutions",
    "there are always strong short ranged repulsive core interactions that must be dealt with in any quantitative theory or simulation .",
    "the mimic system simply treats the short ranged rapidly varying part of the coulomb potential as an additional core - like contribution that generates a modified core interaction .",
    "as we will see , many properties of the full long ranged system can be very accurately described using those of the short ranged mimic system .     the separation of the @xmath14 potential into a short ranged piece @xmath15 and a long ranged piece @xmath16 .",

    "two relevant @xmath17 values are shown for comparison . ]    for simple fluids with short ranged interactions the lmf approach has proved most useful when @xmath11 can be divided into a slowly varying perturbation @xmath18 describing the relatively weak and longer ranged attractive interactions and a short ranged rapidly varying core potential @xmath19 , which accounts for the local excluded volume correlations of the particles .",
    "@xcite a separation with these qualitative features suffices to motivate the derivation of the basic lmf equation that follows .    for any given @xmath20 an associated @xmath21",

    "we can derive an equation for @xmath8 that also turns out to give exact results at very low densities , where pair correlations are not important .",

    "then we can replace the former by the latter , and take the gradient outside the integral and integrate eq [ eq : wsb ] .    in making this replacement",
    "we have ignored correlations between the particles at @xmath4 and @xmath36 , and in most contexts this would represent a crude and generally inaccurate approximation .",
    "however for _ slowly varying _",
    "@xmath37 we see that this particular use of the ( mean field ) approximation can be very accurate , even at high density .",

    "the lmf approach does not specify or require a particular way to do this .",
    "however since the intermolecular interactions and the effective field have shorter ranges in the reference system , both theory and simulations of the nonuniform structure are usually easier to carry out than in the full system .",
    "equation [ eq : rho0rho ] then provides the fundamental link between structure in the nonuniform reference and full systems , and from this thermodynamic functions can be determined .",
    "the name `` local molecular field '' is suggested by the direct analogy to the spatially varying effective field introduced in the usual mean or molecular field theory for a nonuniform ising model.@xcite however , while the latter theory is usually viewed as a crude approximation , the derivation sketched above suggests that if a proper choice of a slowly - varying @xmath37 is made , then accurate results should be found from a self - consistent solution of the lmf equation in many cases , provided that an accurate treatment of the density response @xmath22)$ ] to a given @xmath8 is used . in this paper",
    "we use the exact eq [ eq : lowrho ] below at low densities and results of computer simulations at higher densities , so whatever errors remain arise only from the lmf approximation itself .",
    "lmf theory is equally useful for uniform fluids .",
    "@xcite in particular eq [ eq : lmf ] is consistent with the physical idea that in a _",

    "argument can at best give reasonable results only for uniform fluids at high density .",
    "however , lmf theory can be applied to a general nonuniform fluid , and by taking such a perspective and using only the basic eq [ eq : rho0rho ] , we can significantly improve on the predictions of eq [ eq : gog ] for pair correlations in uniform fluids .",

    "similar accurate results for the nonuniform lj fluid have been found for more general external fields representing hard core solutes of various sizes , for the liquid - vapor interface , and for drying transitions.@xcite thus lmf theory has provided a qualitatively and often quantitatively accurate description of structure , thermodynamics , and phase transitions in fluids with short ranged interactions.@xcite",

    "the solvent is crudely represented by a uniform static dielectric constant @xmath57 . in the limit @xmath2 , the occhs reduces to the ocp .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a characteristic length describing the typical distance between neighboring particles .",
    "a standard choice is the _ ion sphere radius _ @xmath58 chosen so that @xmath59 the nearest neighbor spacing is about @xmath60 when the ions are arranged in a simple cubic lattice .",

    "as argued generally in the seminal work of stillinger and lovett@xcite ( sl ) , there should be complete screening at long wavelengths of any induced charge distribution in a conducting ionic fluid .",
    "this constrains the behavior at small wavevectors of the charge - charge correlation function . for the occhs the only nontrivial correlations are between the positive ions and the results of sl reduce to the requirement that @xmath71 has the _ universal _ form @xmath72 independent of any details of the short ranged core potential @xmath73 or any other short ranged interactions that might exist . here",
    "@xmath74 is the _ debye wavevector _ , defined by @xmath75    the exact vanishing of @xmath71 at @xmath76 arises from electrical neutrality ( the `` zeroth '' moment condition ) and the fixed coefficient of the quadratic term is an example of the famous sl _",
    "second moment condition_.@xcite this behavior is distinctly different than that found in any fluid with short ranged interactions , where @xmath77 at @xmath76 is finite , proportional to the compressibility , and the coefficient of @xmath78 depends on the details of the intermolecular interactions .",
    "thermodynamic properties can be found by integration of the correlation functions . in particular , accounting for the background by taking the appropriate limits of the standard result for a two component system,@xcite the excess internal energy ( over the ideal gas ) of the uniform occhs can be exactly written as @xmath79",
    "we want to use the general lmf equation to describe the ion correlation functions in the uniform occhs .",
    "it is clear from the derivation in section [ sec : lmf ] that a proper separation of the interaction potential @xmath80 is required for this self - consistent approach to be accurate . at first glance",
    "it may seem natural to use the separation on the right side of eq [ eq : wd+wq ] , where @xmath19 is taken to be the hard core potential @xmath73 and @xmath37 is the full point charge interaction @xmath81 in eq [ eq : wq ] . however at short distances outside the hard core the coulomb potential can be strong and rapidly varying and such interactions can not be accurately treated by the averaging used in eq [ eq : lmf ] .",
    "indeed in the ocp with no hard core there are arbitrarily large and rapidly varying interactions as @xmath82 .",
    "this limit makes it clear that we should try to separate the point charge coulomb pair interaction @xmath54 itself into a slowly varying part @xmath83 , which we will take as a particularly appropriate @xmath18 to use in the lmf theory , and then combine the remainder @xmath84 with @xmath85 ( and more generally with any other short ranged core interactions that exist ) to give the associated @xmath6 .",
    "this strategy differs from that used in many density functional and integral equation methods , where one first chooses a mathematically convenient or especially simple _ reference potential _ @xmath86 and then treats the remainder @xmath87 as a perturbation , taking advantage of the particular form of the reference system in whatever approximate theories are used .",
    "however , for coulomb systems at least , the existing theories often have large and uncontrolled errors with the usual choices of @xmath88 .",
    "we believe our approach of choosing a slowly varying @xmath37 for use in the lmf theory offers many conceptual and computational advantages , and it connects directly to similar physically motivated work on fluids with short ranged interactions .    to that end",
    "we interpret the @xmath14 term in @xmath81 as the electrostatic potential of a unit point charge in vacuum .",
    "the same slowly varying asymptotic behavior would come from any other normalized charge distribution and the `` smearing '' of the point charge would produce a less rapidly varying potential at small @xmath89 .",
    "this suggests using a properly chosen charge distribution to determine @xmath83 or @xmath9 .",
    "consider in particular as in the ewald sum method @xcite a normalized unit _",
    "gaussian charge distribution _",
    "@xmath90,\\label{eq : psigmar}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 indicates the length scale of the smearing .",
    "the particular advantages of this choice will soon become apparent .",
    "our use of a gaussian charge distribution to determine a slowly varying part of the coulomb pair interaction is simpler than in the ewald sum method , which considers periodic images of ion configurations with embedded screening ( negative ) and compensating ( positive ) gaussian charge distributions . @xcite    the electrostatic potential @xmath91 arising from eq [ eq : psigmar ] satisfies poisson s equation @xmath92 , which is easily solved by fourier transform to give @xmath93 , \\label{eq : vsigmak}\\ ] ] or in @xmath89-space , @xmath94 where erf is the usual error function.@xcite the point charge model corresponds to the limit @xmath95 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath96 and use this identity to extract from the dimensionless coulomb pair interaction @xmath97 a @xmath0-dependent perturbation piece @xmath98 : @xmath99 this perturbation remains finite as @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ cap : potsept ] , with appropriate choices of @xmath0 we can produce a very slowly varying @xmath102 which from eq [ eq : vsigmak ] also decays very rapidly in @xmath103-space . as argued in section [ sec : lmf ] , these are the qualitative features that would be most appropriate for a perturbation @xmath37 to give accurate results from lmf theory .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 in the gaussian charge distribution permits a _ controlled use _ of the lmf approximation , and as shown below , with proper choices of @xmath0 the lmf theory can give exceptionally accurate results .",
    "any particular choice of @xmath0 in eq [ eq : u1sigma ] then fixes the associated reference system interaction@xcite as @xmath104 the coulomb part @xmath105 of the reference interaction decays very rapidly for @xmath106 for large @xmath89 we have @xmath107.\\label{eq : u0asymp}\\ ] ]    we call the special reference systems that result from optimal choices of @xmath0 as discussed in section [ sec : choiceofsigma ] below _ mimic systems _ , since at high density the local structure in the uniform mimic system as exhibited in @xmath108 very accurately approximates the @xmath45 of the full system as in eq [ eq : gog ]",
    ". this again illustrates the consistency and accuracy of the lmf approach when an appropriate mimic system is used .",
    "equation [ eq : u1sigma ] can also be interpreted physically as the coulomb energy arising from two ions each with a rigid gaussian charge distribution , eq [ eq : psigmar ] , with a width @xmath109 .",
    "more generally , in ionic solutions we can always replace point charges on the ions by rigid charge distributions without changing any physics if we appropriately modify the core interactions as in eq [ eq : u0sigma ] . this can be very useful because the rapidly varying short ranged parts of the coulomb interaction can often be more accurately treated by the same specialized methods used for the other strong core interactions , which must be present in any realistic model of ionic solutions .",
    "we now apply the general lmf eq [ eq : lmf ] to the occhs in the special case where the external field @xmath43 is that resulting from an ion fixed at the origin , given by eq [ eq : wd+wq ] .",
    "this choice allows us to describe uniform fluids , as discussed in section [ sec : uniform ] .",
    "we take advantage of spherical symmetry and use the gaussian charge separation of @xmath3 given in eqs [ eq : u1sigma ] and [ eq : u0sigma ] .",
    "the lmf eq [ eq : lmf ] can be naturally rewritten in terms of the more slowly varying `` perturbation part '' of the effective field @xmath110 if the perfect cancellation argument were exact , then @xmath111 , or @xmath112 corresponding to a fixed mimic particle at the origin , and the resulting induced density in the mimic system would be @xmath113)=\\rho^{b}h_{0}(r)$ ] , with @xmath114 the pair correlation function in the uniform mimic system .",
    "the lmf equation corrects this approximation by determining a finite short ranged effective field perturbation @xmath115 which we can picture as arising from a modified solute particle at the origin , @xcite that takes better account of the locally averaged effects of the slowly varying interactions @xmath12 .",

    "a similar scaling of the lmf equation for systems with short ranged interactions was discussed earlier.@xcite    before giving quantitative results in sections [ sec : lowrhoresults ] and [ sec : highdensity ] below , let us discuss some qualitative features of a self - consistent solution of eq [ eq : lmfalpha ] .",

    "we show below in section [ sec : lowrhoresults ] that with optimal choices of the key parameter @xmath0 , even the unscaled lmf theory with @xmath135 often gives very good numerical results .",
    "however it is conceptually important to realize that the lmf approach can be naturally generalized as in eq [ eq : lmfalpha ] so that the exact second moment condition is satisfied , and this adds essentially no numerical costs to the self consistent solution .",

    "the choice of @xmath13 determines an effective coulomb core size from the core component @xmath105 of the coulomb interaction .",

    "we will see below that these qualitative considerations hold true generally .",
    "in particular , by choosing @xmath0 large enough we can guarantee that @xmath144 is nonzero only at small wavevectors , since the gaussian factor in eq [ eq : lmfalpha ] causes rapid decay for @xmath145 .",

    "family _ of uniform mimic systems for different @xmath147 @xmath153 all of which should give essentially the same short ranged structure at high density that closely approximates that of the full ionic system .",
    "this is a dramatic example showing that the inverse problem of uniquely determining the intermolecular potential from @xmath114 can be ill - conditioned .",
    "a `` molecular - sized '' choice of @xmath154 for the mimic system is considerably smaller than the typical choices made in ewald sum methods , where @xmath0 is usually taken to be proportional to the simulation system size.@xcite larger @xmath0 values will give equally good results , provided that the resulting mimic system is described accurately .",

    "the lmf theory can then reproduce the exact long wavelength behavior found by sl , and the slowly varying smeared coulomb perturbations have little effect on the shorter wavelength correlations induced by the modified ion cores in the mimic system , just as illustrated here for the occhs .",
