    "the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry plays a central role in the spectrum of light hadrons .",
    "since it is an intrinsically non - perturbative phenomenon , the only way to study it from the first principles of qcd is via the lattice regularization . yet",
    ", already many years ago nielsen and ninomiya proved that a translationally invariant , local lattice formulation of the qcd dirac operator @xmath9 , retaining chiral symmetry in the massless limit , and with the correct number of physical fermionic degrees of freedom , is forbidden  @xcite .",
    "this no - go theorem can be circumvented , by constructing lattice fermions satisfying a _ modified _ form of chiral symmetry  @xcite , and obeying the ginsparg- wilson relation  @xcite .",
    "although explicit formulations of lattice ginsparg - wilson fermions are known  @xcite , currently their practical use in realistic , large - scale lattice qcd simulations is still limited , due to the high computational overhead .",
    "the most widely - used lattice discretizations of the dirac operator are either based on the addition of a second - derivative term to the kinetic part of the quark action  @xcite to remove ( or `` quench '' ) the unphysical `` doubler '' modes in the continuum limit by giving them a mass @xmath10 , or on a site - dependent spin diagonalization , which leads to the so - called staggered formulation  @xcite .",
    "the former approach introduces an explicit breaking of chiral symmetry , and , as a consequence , an additive renormalization of the quark mass , which has to be fine - tuned .",
    "in contrast , the staggered operator preserves a remnant of chiral symmetry ( sufficient to forbid additive mass renormalization ) , and leads to a reduction of the matrix size .",
    "however , the staggered formulation only removes part of the unphysical modes , reducing the number of quark species in four ( @xmath11 ) spacetime dimensions from 16 ( @xmath12 ) down to four ( @xmath13 ) `` tastes '' , which become degenerate  @xcite ( and consistent with the properties related to the global symmetries of the continuum dirac operator  @xcite ) in the @xmath14 limit . in order to simulate qcd with two light fermions ,",
    "one then has to apply the so - called `` rooting trick '' , which has been a subject of debate for the last few years  @xcite .",
    "some recent works have discussed the idea of using a staggered kernel with a _ taste - dependent _ mass term to obtain two ( or one  @xcite ) massless fermion species . such formulation , which is one of the various approaches aiming at minimally doubled fermions  @xcite , could combine the advantages of the overlap construction with the computational efficiency of a staggered kernel .",
    "furthermore , this formulation appears to be particularly attractive from the point of view of topological properties  @xcite .    using a staggered operator with a `` flavored '' mass term as",
    "the kernel in an overlap construction is a very appealing idea , but the properties of such operators ( with various taste - dependent mass terms ) are interesting on their own .",
    "in fact , while the overlap construction completely removes the need for fine tuning to achieve massless fermions , it still leads to a considerable computational overhead .",
    "in contrast , using a staggered operator with taste - dependent mass _  la _ wilson requires fine tuning to obtain exactly massless modes , but , by virtue of the reduced size of the operator , may still be a computationally competitive alternative to the usual wilson discretization , while avoiding the rooting prescription",
    ".    this motivation led us to address a numerical investigation of different operators of this type that we present here ( preliminary results have appeared in @xcite ) . in the following , we present a systematic classification of the possible taste - dependent mass terms , discuss their analytical features in the free theory , and then move on to the interacting case that we study via numerical simulations .",
    "we perform an elementary measurement of the pion mass on a set of quenched configurations , and verify the expected pcac behaviour as one approaches the chiral limit . in an appendix",
    ", we also explore the properties of the staggered overlap operator proposed in @xcite , in comparison with the usual overlap based on the wilson kernel .",
    "in particular , we compare the locality of the operators , and the computational cost of applying them to a vector and of solving for the quark propagator .",

    "the staggered operator  @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , is a computationally very efficient way to discretize the massless qcd dirac operator on a @xmath11-dimensional euclidean hypercubic lattice of spacing @xmath18 .",
    "this operator is invariant under a global @xmath19 symmetry , which can be interpreted as a remnant of chiral symmetry : in fact , @xmath20 anticommutes with the operator @xmath21 defined by @xmath22 . in the free theory , one can easily see that in four dimensions the operator @xmath21 has @xmath23 structure in spin - taste space  @xcite . the construction of @xmath20 is based on a local spin diagonalization , which , for the four - dimensional case , allows one to reduce the number of fermion components by a factor of @xmath24 with respect to the naive operator , and yields four tastes in the continuum limit .",
    "the degeneracy between these four tastes is explicitly broken by gauge interactions at finite lattice spacing @xmath18 , but is recovered in the continuum limit @xmath14 .",
    "recently , various works explored the idea of using staggered operators with taste - dependent mass terms  @xcite .",
    "following , e.g. , the discussion in the classic paper by golterman and smit  @xcite , the possible matrix structures ( in taste space ) for a mass term can be classified as    * @xmath25 ( `` 0-link '' ) , of the form @xmath26 * @xmath27 ( `` 1-link '' ) , involving a sum of terms , each containing 1 link @xmath28 * @xmath29 ( `` 2-link '' ) , involving a sum of terms , each containing 2 links @xmath30 * @xmath31 ( `` 3-link '' ) , involving a sum of terms , each containing 3 links @xmath32 * @xmath33 ( `` 4-link '' ) , involving a sum of terms , each containing 4 links @xmath34    it is highly desirable to preserve the symmetry @xmath35 , because it guarantees that @xmath36 is real , and non - negative ( in the absence of real negative eigenvalues ) , thus avoiding a `` sign problem '' in the measure  @xcite .",
    "this symmetry is satisfied only if the hermitian mass term connects sites of the same parity .",
    "thus , we do not consider the 1-link or a 3-link mass terms further .",
    "this leaves three possibilities : 0- , 2- and 4-link mass terms .",
    "@xcite . in that case , @xmath33- hermitian mass terms are obtained in the 0- , 1- and 3-link cases .",

    "we also performed an elementary study of pion propagators , which shows that the lightest meson is rather easy to isolate without explicitly disentangling spin and taste degrees of freedom .",
    "approaching the chiral limit requires in general the fine - tuning of an additive mass term , as for wilson fermions .",
    "one important exception occurs for the 2-link operator : if one chooses the middle branch of the spectrum , one can study a theory with two tastes , where the additive mass renormalization vanishes due to the symmetry of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , no fine - tuning is needed .",
    "although the 2-link operator was designed to produce a single taste ( with a fine - tuned additive mass ) , it may well be that its most promising use is to simulate two tastes without additive mass renormalization .",
    "note that the heavy doubler modes do not completely decouple in that situation . in the background of a topological charge @xmath129 , they contribute real eigenvalues @xmath130 and @xmath131 , making the determinant negative when @xmath129 is odd .",
    "the @xmath132-parameter is thus equal to @xmath133 .",
    "this sign @xmath134 should be removed by hand ( or simply ignored ) in order to simulate the @xmath135 theory .    finally , we studied the properties of an overlap operator with a @xmath49 kernel ( see appendix ) .",
    "we found that its locality properties are similar to those of the operator based on a wilson kernel .",
    "as it concerns the computational cost for a quark propagator calculation , we found that , in the free limit or on very smooth gauge configurations , the inversion of the operator based on a kernel with a four - link mass term is almost one order of magnitude faster than using an overlap with wilson kernel .",
    "however , we also observed a significant loss of efficiency on interacting ( quenched ) configurations at @xmath110 , where the operator with the @xmath49 kernel is only approximately twice as fast as that with a wilson kernel .",
    "the reason for this can probably be traced back to the fact that the four - link transporters in the mass term are more sensitive to the effect of the fluctuations in gauge configurations on coarser lattices .",
    "our crude assessment indicates that this new , staggered , overlap operator does not bring a major computational advantage over a wilson kernel , while producing two degenerate flavors , but without the full @xmath136 flavor symmetry",
    ".    two copies of an overlap operator with a kernel based on hoelbling s 2-link operator would give more flexibility , e.g. that of simulating two flavors with unequal masses , for a similar computer effort .",
    "* note added : * after this paper was completed , a difficulty with the hoelbling operator @xmath48 eq.([twolinkkernel ] ) was pointed out by steve sharpe , and clarified by david adams , during the yukawa institute workshop `` new types of fermions on the lattice '' .",
    "it appears that the hoelbling operator lacks sufficient rotational symmetry , so that fine - tuned wilson loop counterterms will presumably be needed to maintain hypercubic rotational symmetry in unquenched simulations .",
    "adams operator @xmath49 eq.([fourlinkkernel ] ) does not suffer from this problem .",
    "this research was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada , by the academy of finland , project 1134018 , and in part by the national science foundation under grant no .",

    "we also studied the properties of an overlap operator based on a staggered @xmath49 kernel , as originally proposed in @xcite .",
    "the construction is completely standard : @xmath137 and leads to two exactly massless physical fermions in the continuum limit , without fine - tuning . as compared to a conventional overlap operator based on a wilson kernel , the potential advantages of this construction are related to the reduced kernel size ( @xmath49 is a matrix of size four times smaller than a wilson operator on the same lattice ) .",
    "we take @xmath138 .    to understand the effectiveness of an overlap operator with a @xmath49 kernel ,",
    "the first important issue to be discussed is the locality of the operator . as is well - known , an overlap operator is not ultra - local  @xcite .",
    "its locality properties can be studied by looking at the decay of its matrix elements between source and sink at sites @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( which we denote as @xmath141 , where , for simplicity , we only show the indices corresponding to the site coordinates ) , as a function of the distance between @xmath139 and @xmath140  @xcite .",
    "to this end , in the two plots at the top of fig .",
    "8 we show the decay of @xmath142 against @xmath143 , the 1-norm distance ( or `` manhattan distance '' ) between the sites @xmath139 and @xmath140 , comparing the matrix elements of an overlap operator obtained using a @xmath49 kernel ( left panel ) or a conventional wilson kernel ( right panel ) . although the @xmath49 kernel is less local than the wilson kernel , the locality properties of the corresponding overlap operators are comparable .",
    "this appears quite clearly in the plots displayed at the bottom of the figure , in which the results for the two operators are shown together , for a cold configuration ( left panel ) and for a configuration at @xmath110 ( right panel ) .",
    "another important factor in the efficiency of a lattice dirac operator is the cost of applying the operator to a vector .",
    "the multiplication by the kernel is about twice as fast , if one uses @xmath49 instead of a wilson kernel ( staggered fields do not have an explicit spinor index but @xmath49 has twice as many non - zero elements as the wilson operator ) . in the computation of the sign of @xmath144 , using the conjugate gradient ( cg ) method , and no deflation , the gain with respect to a conventional wilson kernel is a factor ranging from approximately 2 - 3 to about 8 .",
    "however , these numbers are only gross estimates , and could be improved , e.g. , by optimizing the parameters of the @xmath49 kernel . similarly , an improved form for the kinetic operator , link smearing ( for the kinetic and/or the mass term ) , and standard tricks related to deflation , preconditioning , etc ... could be applied .",
    "to discuss the computational cost of the inversion of the operator , we compared the two overlap operators on the same pure - glue , @xmath110 , background on a @xmath106 lattice , using the same , basic , inner / outer cg algorithm . in our computation , we evaluated the propagator as the solution of the equation : @xmath145 with @xmath146 , using a conjugate gradient ( cg ) iterative solver : at each iteration , @xmath147 is applied to a vector @xmath148 through a 2-pass lanczos process .",
    "one builds a tridiagonal matrix @xmath149 and takes the signs of its eigenvalues ( which are representative of those of @xmath89 ) , then reconstructs @xmath150 , as described in ref .",
    "the results are displayed at the top of fig .",
    "8 : the three plots ( from left to right ) show the computational cost for the outer cg iteration , for the matrix - times - vector multiplication , and the total cpu cost . for comparison , we also show the analogous results in the free - field case , in the plots at the bottom of the figure .",
    "this comparison shows that the computational advantages expected from elementary arguments , and observed in the free limit , turn out to be dramatically reduced in `` realistic '' interacting configurations .",
    "again , this reduction points to a reduction in the eigenvalue gap of @xmath49 .",
