    ". the change of behavior arises from a bifurcation of the transition state , from a zero - dimensional ( i.e. , constant ) configuration below @xmath16 , to a spatially varying ( degenerate ) pair of `` periodic instantons '' above @xmath16 .",
    "the quantitative effects of the transition are significant . in the weak - noise limit",
    ", the activation rate is given by the kramers formula @xmath17 , where @xmath18  is the noise strength , @xmath19 the activation barrier , and @xmath20 the rate prefactor .",
    "the barrier @xmath19 is interpreted as the height , in dimensionless energy units , of the transition state , and by analogy with chemical kinetics , the exponential falloff of the rate is often called ` arrhenius behavior ' .",
    "the dependence on system size @xmath21 of @xmath19 changes qualitatively at @xmath16 .",

    "given the increasingly anomalous behavior of the escape rate as @xmath16 is approached from either side , a few words should be said about the domain of validity of the kramers formula @xmath24 for the escape rate , which displays arrhenius behavior with both @xmath20 and @xmath19 independent of @xmath18 . strictly speaking ,",
    "this formula is _ asymptotically _ valid , that is , only in the limit @xmath22 . in a looser sense",

    "physically , the crossover arises from a competition between the bending and bulk energies of the transition state .",
    "this crossover will be analyzed in succeeding sections ; we will see that it corresponds to an asymptotically sharp , second - order phase transition in the activation rate .",

    "what the formal divergence of the prefactor _ does _ mean is that the escape behavior becomes increasingly anomalous as @xmath0 is approached , and it is asymptotically _ non - arrhenius _ exactly at @xmath0 .",
    "that is , when @xmath168 the true rate prefactor should scale as a ( negative ) power of @xmath18 for all @xmath22 . as in @xcite ,",
    "this can be treated quantitatively by studying the splayout of the ` tube ' within which fluctuations are largely confined , as the saddle is approached . `",
    "splayout ' here simply means that the fluctuational tube width , which for @xmath169 is @xmath170 , becomes @xmath171 , with @xmath172 , as the saddle is approached when @xmath168 . in the model",
    "studied in @xcite , the lagrangian manifold comprising optimal fluctuational trajectories has a more complicated behavior than in the model under study here .",
    "as a result , in @xcite fluctuations near the saddle occur on all lengthscales , while in the present case fluctuations near the saddle occur on a definite lengthscale , but one larger than @xmath170 , leading to non - arrhenius behavior for all @xmath22 .",
    "details will be presented in @xcite .",
    "our main interest here is in the region close to @xmath0 , where the rate prefactor @xmath20 is growing anomalously large ( but remains everywhere finite for all @xmath45 strictly away from @xmath0 ) .",
    "the formulas given here are valid for @xmath18 sufficiently small so that the contribution from the quadratic fluctuations about the relevant extremal state of @xmath173 $ ] dominates the action .",
    "as long as all eigenvalues of @xmath84 $ ] are nonzero ( excluding the zero mode arising from translational symmetry , which may be extracted ) , and the norms of the corresponding eigenfunctions are bounded away from zero , the prefactor formula applies , but in an @xmath18-region driven to zero as @xmath147 by the rate of vanishing of the eigenvalue(s ) of smallest magnitude .",
