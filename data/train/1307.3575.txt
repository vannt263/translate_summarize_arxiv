    "classical random walks are non quantum , non relativistic models of diffusion in which both time and space are discrete .",
    "the simplest formal quantum analogues of random walks are the discrete - time quantum walks ( dtqws ) , which have been introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they can be used to model transport in solids @xcite , disordered media @xcite and even complexes of algae @xcite .",
    "they also constitute simple systems where decoherence can be fruitfully explored @xcite and are also of great importance in quantum information and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "relativistic diffusion models have been developed , not only to deal with relativistic particle transport , but also to serve as templates to build consistent relativistic hydrodynamical theories @xcite and realistic models of non relativistic transport at bounded velocity @xcite . to obtain relativistic diffusion models , one must ( i ) jettysone discretization and treat space and time as continuous ( ii ) introduce equations of motion which fix the position of the particle , not only in space - time , but in relativistic phase - space .",
    "the simplest model of physical relevance is the relativistic ornsetin - uhlenbeck process ( roup ) , which has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "other processes have been proposed , notably by franchi - lejan @xcite and dunkel - haenggi @xcite .",
    "a unified presentation can be found in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more information on this rapidly growing field .",
    "the aim of this article is to present new results addressing propagation in both dtqws and relativistic diffusions .",
    "here is a summary of the material .",
    "analytically , propagation can be ascertained by showing that the dynamics is controlled by a wave equation .",
    "it is well - known that at least some dtqws display propagative features @xcite .",
    "these features are best highlighted by examining the continuous limits of quantum walks .",
    "we revisit this problem by considering the most general 1d quantum walks with time - and position - dependent coefficients .",
    "the object which can admit a continuous limit is _ not _ generically a given discrete - time walk , but rather a 1-jet of discrete - time walks , which regroups all walks which share a common expansion in the time - and length steps as these tend to zero .",
    "only certain jets obeying particular scaling laws admit a continuous limit .",
    "we investigate the richest scaling law and prove that the continuous limit of the associated 1-jets is described by a dirac equation obeyed by a fermion coupled to an electronagnetic field .",
    "analytical results on relativistic diffusions are difficult to obtain and exist in the long - time limit only , where a large class of models ( including the roup ) actually behave as classical traditional galilean diffusions .",
    "we have studied the short- and intermediate time behaviour of the roup through numerical simulations of the associated transport equation .",
    "our results show that , contrary to all expectations , the roup displays propagative behaviour at short times .",
    "we also present numerical evidence that the time - evolution of the density profile of the roup strongly resembles the time - evolution of a decohering @xcite or random @xcite quantum walk .",
    "we finally show that the roup obeys a geometrical generalization of fick s law which links relativistic diffusions with black hole physics and geometrical flows .",
    "we consider quantum walks defined over discrete time and discrete one dimensional space , driven by time- and space - dependent quantum coins acting on a two - dimensional hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "the walks are defined by the following finite difference equations , valid for all @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 this operator is in su(2 ) only for @xmath5 = @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are then called the three euler angles of @xmath11 .",
    "the index @xmath12 labels instants and the index @xmath13 labels spatial points . the wave function @xmath14 has two components @xmath15 and @xmath16 which code for the probability amplitudes of the particle jumping towards the left or towards the right . the total probability @xmath17 is independent of @xmath12 _ i.e. _ conserved by the walk .",
    "the set of angles @xmath18 defines the walks and at this stage is arbitrary with the only resriction on @xmath5 seen above to save the unitarity of the propagation . to investigate the continuous limit ,",
    "we first introduce a time step @xmath19 and a space step @xmath20 .",
    "we then introduce , for any quantity @xmath21 appearing in ( [ eq : defwalkdiscr ] ) , a function @xmath22 defined on @xmath23 such that the number @xmath24 is the value taken by @xmath22 at the space - time point @xmath25 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : defwalkdiscr ] ) then reads : @xmath26 where the tilde s have been dropped on all functions to simplify the notation and the euler angles in the matrix are time and space dependent .",
    "we now suppose , that all functions can be chosen at least @xmath27 in both space and time variables for all sufficiently small values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the formal continuous limit is defined as the couple of differential equations obtained from ( [ eq : defwalk ] ) by letting both @xmath19 and @xmath20 tend to zero .",
    "let us now introduce a time - scale @xmath28 , a length - scale @xmath29 , an infinitesimal @xmath30 and write @xmath31 where @xmath32 traces the fact that @xmath19 and @xmath20 may tend to zero differently .",
    "for the continuous limit to exist , at least formally , the operator @xmath33 must also tend to unity as @xmath30 tends to zero .",
    "this is so because the two column vectors of the left - hand side and on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : defwalk ] ) both tend to @xmath34 when @xmath19 and @xmath20 tend to zero .",
    "let us define the scaling laws for the angles by the relations : @xmath35 where the four exponents @xmath5 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are all positive .",
    "imposing that b tends to unity as @xmath30 tends to zero leads to : @xmath39 these can only be satisfied if there is a integer @xmath40 such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "note that there is no constraint on @xmath43 _ i.e. _ on the limit of the euler angle @xmath10 at @xmath44 .",
    "the continuous limit can then be investigated by taylor expanding @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 in powers of @xmath30 .",
    "possible relationship between the exponents @xmath5 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are found by examining the lowest order contributions .",
    "one has : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 equation ( [ eq : defwalk ] ) then leads to : @xmath54 zeroth order contributions cancel out as expected and the remaining terms must balance each other .",
    "the richest and most interesting case corresponds to @xmath55 because all contributions to ( [ eq : basescal ] ) are then of equal importance .",
    "this is the scaling law that will be investigated in the remaining of this article .",
    "dimensionless time and space coordinates are @xmath56 and @xmath57 . the natural space - time coordinates to investigate the above scaling law turn out to be the so - called null coordinates @xmath58 and @xmath59 , defined in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 by @xmath62 partial derivatives with respect to these null coordinates read : @xmath63 .",
    "the expansion of the discrete equations leads , at first order in @xmath30 , to the following continuous equations of motion for @xmath64 and @xmath16 : @xmath65 and @xmath66    taken together , these two coupled first - order equations look like a dirac equation in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "let us thus recall a few well - known fact about dirac equations in @xmath67 space - time dimensions .",
    "in flat two dimensional space - times , the clifford algebra can be represented by @xmath68 matrices acting on two - component spinors @xcite .",
    "this algebra admits two independents generators @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which can be represented by @xmath68 matrices obeying the usual anti - commutation relation : @xmath71 where @xmath38 is the minkovski metric and @xmath72 is the identity ( unity ) matrix .",
    "consider the representation @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the three pauli matrices : @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80    the equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) can be recast in the following compact form : @xmath81 where @xmath82 = @xmath83 - i @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91    equation is a generalized dirac - equation is @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "the coupling between @xmath14 and the electromagnetic field @xmath92 is standard , but the mass term is not : for arbitrary @xmath10 , the masses of the two components @xmath64 and @xmath16 are neither identical nor real , but are complex conjugate to each other .",
    "these two masses are equal and real if @xmath93 _",
    "i.e. _ if there exists and integer @xmath94 such that @xmath95 .",
    "the common mass @xmath13 is them equal to @xmath96 and its sign thus depends on both @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the roup is a stochastic process which describes the diffusion of a special relativistic point mass @xmath13 in a fluid at equilibrium with temperature @xmath99 .",
    "it is completely defined @xcite , in @xmath100 space dimensions , by the equations of motion of the point mass in the rest frame of fluid : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the squared euclidean norm of @xmath104 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : langevinx ] ) is simply the definition of the relativistic @xmath100-momentum in terms of the velocity @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : langevinp ] ) states that the force acting on the particle splits into two contributions .",
    "the first one is a deterministic friction @xmath105 , which forces the @xmath100-momentum to relax to the vanishing @xmath100-momentum of the fluid in which the particle diffuses , and the second one is a @xmath100-dimensional centered gaussian white noise . the noise coefficient @xmath106 is linked to @xmath5 and @xmath99 by the fluctation - dissipation relation @xmath107 .    the temperature @xmath99 and the mass @xmath13 define the thermal velocity @xmath108 ; this velocity , combined with the time - scale @xmath109 , defines the length - scale @xmath110 .",
    "we use these characteristic scales to define dimensionless time , position and momentum variables @xmath61 , @xmath60 and @xmath111 by @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the relativistic character of the problem is traced by the quotient @xmath115this parameter is the dimensionless value of the light velocity @xmath116 .",
    "the galilean limit corresponds to @xmath117 and the so - called ultrarelativistic case corresponds to @xmath118 .",
    "the equations of motion , being stochastic , do not generate a single trajectory from a given initial condition , but rather an infinite set of possible trajectories .",
    "the position of the particle in its phase - space @xmath119 is thus represented , for a given initial condition and value of @xmath120 , by a probability density @xmath121 with respect to @xmath122 .",
    "this density obeys the forward kolmogorov equation @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 is the lorentz factor .",
    "the jttner distribution @xcite describing a relativistic thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath99 reads simply : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the normalization factor ; this distribution obeys @xmath128 .",
    "the density of the process @xmath129 and the particle current density @xmath130 at time @xmath61 and position @xmath131 are defined by : @xmath132 and @xmath133 they obey the continuity relation @xmath134 .",
    "fick s law posits that the current density and density gradient are proportional to each other with constant coefficient .",
    "this simple assumption is not valid for the roup .",
    "the generalized fick s law obeyed by the roup is presented in section * * * below .",
    "the spatial fourier transform @xmath135 of the phase - space density @xmath136 is defined by @xmath137 and obeys : @xmath138 the fourier tranform @xmath139 is defined in a similar manner and coincides with the integral of @xmath135 over @xmath111 .",
    "suppose a diffusing particle is put into the fluid at time @xmath140 with initial position @xmath141 and initial temperature @xmath142 .",
    "the initial condition for equation ( [ eq : dedimfp ] ) is then @xmath143 or , in fourier space , @xmath144 this initial condition fully determines , for each value of @xmath120 , the value of density @xmath136 at all times and phase - space positions",
    ". equation ( [ eq : dedimhatf ] ) does not involve any derivation with respect to @xmath145 , which can thus be viewed as a simple parameter ( as opposed to a fully - fledged variable with respect to which derivations are performed ) .",
    "numerical simulations have been carried out by solving ( [ eq : dedimhatf ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath136 has been recovered by fast fourier transform and the spatial density @xmath146 as well as the current @xmath147 have been obtained from @xmath136 by direct numerical quadrature .",
    "all simulations have been performed with mathematica 8 . various integration methods and",
    "limit conditions in @xmath111 have been used , to ensure the robustness of numerical results .",
    "the spatial density @xmath148 at time @xmath61 and point @xmath60 vanishes for @xmath149 ( remember @xmath120 is the dimensionless value of the light velocity @xmath116 ) . to obtain the best visual representation of the early time evolution of the density profile",
    ", we introduce the rescaled position variable @xmath150 and the rescaled density @xmath151 , which is normalized to unity against the measure @xmath152 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 present typical plots of @xmath153 against @xmath9 for different values of @xmath61 and @xmath120 . at early times , the maximum of the density profile is not situated at @xmath154 _",
    "i.e. _ at the starting point of the diffusion , but rather at @xmath155 where @xmath156 is time - independent and approximately equal to 0.948 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath157 _ i.e. _ @xmath158 .",
    "this means that the diffusion , at early times , mostly propagates at velocity @xmath159 . in time",
    ", a secondary maximum appears at the origin point @xmath154 .",
    "this secondary maximum grows and finally becomes much higher than the peaks at @xmath160 .",
    "the density profile thus gets closer and closer to the standard gaussian @xmath161 predicted by fick s law @xcite .      at early times",
    ", the fourier transform @xmath135 of the phase - space density is _ a priori _ close to its initial value @xmath162 . as indicated above , @xmath163 .",
    "thus , at early times , the fourier transform @xmath135 obeys approximately @xmath164 which can be integrated easily into : @xmath165 carrying out the inverse fourier transform and the integration over @xmath111 leads to @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the lorentz factor associated to the velocity @xmath168 .",
    "this function of @xmath169 strongly resembles the early time density profile of the roup , with the characteristic ` valley ' shape around the origin and maxima at @xmath170 , remarkably close to the numerically observed maxima situated at @xmath171 ( see the above first section ) .",
    "it also tends very rapidly to zero as @xmath169 tends towards @xmath172 because the lorentz factor tends to infinity at these points , and the exponential thus tends to zero .",
    "one might wonder if the propagative behaviour of the roup is compatible with any generalization of fick s law and what this generalization , if it exists , looks like .",
    "the roup does obey a generalization of fick s law and this generalization is best understood in geometrical terms .",
    "metric @xmath173 defined over an @xmath100-dimensional physical space defines in a canonical manner a brownian motion on this space .",
    "this result is well - known for time - indepedent metrics @xcite but has been extended recently @xcite to time - dependent ones .",
    "for this brownian motion , the link between the density @xmath174 ( with respect to the @xmath173-independent measure @xmath175 ) , the current density @xmath176 and the metric @xmath173 reads @xmath177 where @xmath178 has been assumed .",
    "this last equation is a clear generalization of fick s law .",
    "changing point of view , this equation can also be viewed as a differential equation to be solved for the metric @xmath173 at given density density @xmath174 and current @xmath176 .",
    "let @xmath179 be a metric thus associated to @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "this metric is best obtained from @xmath146 and @xmath147 by rewriting ( [ eq : genfick ] ) in terms of @xmath180 , which leads to : @xmath181 we choose as solution @xmath182 with @xmath183 the standard , galilean ornstein - uhlenbeck process corresponds to @xmath184 ; as shown in @xcite , @xmath185 , so that @xmath186 , which is flat and tends ( as it should ) to @xmath187 , _",
    "i.e. _ the time - independent euclidean metric , as @xmath61 tends to infinity .",
    "typical results are displayed in figure 3 .",
    "the metric is nearly flat at the centre of the interval @xmath188 but grows to infinity near @xmath189 .",
    "consider for example a point with coordinate @xmath60 and a point with coordinate @xmath190 , @xmath191 .",
    "as far as the diffusion is concerned , the effective distance between these two points at time @xmath61 is @xmath192 .",
    "this distance grows to infinity for any finite @xmath193 when @xmath60 approaches @xmath194 .",
    "thus , the distance that a particle needs to travel to get closer to @xmath195 by the amount @xmath193 tends to infinity as the particle approaches @xmath194 .",
    "this prevents the particle from ever crossing @xmath196 _ i.e. _ from being transported faster than light .",
    "let us add that the metric @xmath179 can be used to construct the space - time metric @xmath197 , defined by @xmath198 , that @xmath197 is conformal to @xmath199 , and that this last metric admits an horizon at @xmath200 .",
    "we finally remark that the apparently simpler generalization of fick s law @xmath201 is ruled out by numerical simulations ( data not shown ) because the current @xmath147 , in the short - time propagative regime , does not vanish at the two maxima of @xmath146 .",
    "a similar simple proportionality between @xmath147 and @xmath146 in fourier space is also ruled out , for similar reasons .",
    "quantum walks and relativistic diffusions are generalizations of classical random walks .",
    "we have presented new evidence , both analytical and numerical , that quantum walks and relativistic diffusions , contrary to classical diffusions , display propagative behaviour . at the continuous limit ,",
    "the very general unitary quantum walks we have considered in this article display propagation at all times while the roup only displays propagation at short times .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the density profile of the roup seems to follow the same time - evolution as the density profiles of non - unitary , decohering quantum walks @xcite and of random quantum walks @xcite ( which do not admit continuous limits ) .",
    "we thus suggest that decohering and random quantum walks may be adequately modelled by relativistic diffusions .",
    "if that is indeed true , observing quantum walks decohere would constitute laboratory experiments of relativistic transport .",
    "as mentionned earlier , the generalized fick s law presented in section iii.d has an obvious connection with black hole physics",
    ". it also defines a natural geometrical flow on the unit @xmath100-dimensional ball .",
    "if the above connection between relativistic diffusions and quantum walks is true , this means that decohering quantum transport also connects with general relativity and geometrical flows .                                  c.  chevalier , f.  debbasch and j.p .",
