    "granular media are simultaneously one of the most common and complex forms of matter on earth .",
    "this complexity stems , in part , from heterogeneous structure and highly nonlinear particulate interactions @xcite . over the past thirty years",
    ", mechanical wave propagation in ordered granular media has become an active field of research as it provides a setting for the broader understanding of granular media dynamics @xcite .",
    "ordered granular media have also been shown to enable a wide array of novel passive wave tailoring devices that leverage the nonlinear response stemming from the hertzian relationship between elastic particles in contact @xcite , in conjunction with dispersion induced by periodicity @xcite or local resonances @xcite .",
    "experimental configurations used to study mechanical wave propagation in ordered granular media typically involve spherical particles confined by elastic media .",
    "this type of arrangement is particularly common in one- and two - dimensional configurations , and includes macro- to microscale particles .",
    "for example , at the macroscale , elastic rod structures , tracks , and tubes have been used to confine the particles in one - dimensional @xcite and quasi - one - dimensional @xcite configurations , and elastic plates have been used in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "more recently , the dynamics of a two - dimensional monolayer of 1 @xmath0 silica particles adhered to an elastic substrate was studied using a laser ultrasonic technique @xcite .",
    "analytical models used to describe the dynamics of these systems typically only include the interaction between the particles ( often just the normal hertzian contact interaction ) and disregard the effect of the substrate . in reality , even for the simple case of a particle monolayer on a substrate , more complex dynamics involving interactions between the particles and elastic waves in the substrate should be expected .",
    "indeed , a recent experiment @xcite showed that a monolayer of microspheres adhered to a substrate strongly interacts with rayleigh surface waves in the substrate , leading to the hybridization between rayleigh waves and a microsphere contact resonance .",
    "the results of this experiment were analyzed with a simple model involving only vertical ( normal to the substrate surface ) vibrations of isolated particles , following the approach adopted in earlier theoretical works on the interaction of surface oscillators with rayleigh waves @xcite .",
    "however , in reality , the particle motion is not confined to the vertical direction , and the rayleigh wave has a significant horizontal component .",
    "furthermore , the interaction between neighboring particles in contact is expected to significantly influence the dynamics .    a notable theoretical work @xcite provided a model for the dynamics of a monolayer adhered to an elastic substrate which accounted for both normal and horizontal motion and interaction between the particles .",
    "however , this study did not take into account particle rotation . a more recent study @xcite demonstrated that the rotational degree of freedom has a profound effect on the dynamics of granular monolayers .",
    "however , the analysis of monolayers on substrates in ref .",
    "@xcite only accounted for normal contact interactions between the particles and the substrate , and the substrate was considered rigid .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide a theoretical model for the contact - based dynamics of a two - dimensional layer of spheres on a substrate , accounting for the elasticity of the substrate , translational and rotational motion of the spheres , and both normal and shear stiffnesses of sphere - to - sphere and sphere - substrate contacts .",
    "we focus on a system with microscale particles that interact with each other and with the substrate via van der waals adhesion forces . rather than postulate the contact stiffness constants ,",
    "we derive them from hertzian contact models .",
    "this imposes certain constraints on the values of the constants : for example , the ratio of the normal and shear contact stiffness between the spheres is a constant only weakly dependent on poisson s ratio .",
    "we consider contact - based modes having frequencies significantly below the intrinsic spheroidal vibrational modes of the spheres , such that they can be described as spring - mass oscillators .",
    "furthermore , we focus on dynamics involving particle and substrate displacements in the sagittal plane , as would be detectable in a laser - based experiment , such as that of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we start with the case of a rigid substrate , where we find three eigenmodes involving vertical , horizontal and rotational motion of the spheres . in the long - wavelength limit",
    "these modes yield three contact resonances , for which simple analytical expressions are obtained .",
    "one of the resonances only involves motion of the spheres normal to the substrate surface , whereas the other two involve mixed horizontal - rotational motion .",
    "we then present our effective medium model , which describes the interaction between the spheres and the substrate .",
    "the results show that the contact resonances interact with rayleigh surface waves , which leads to mode hybridization and avoided crossings .",
    "we discuss the behavior for cases involving both isolated ( non - touching ) and interacting spheres , and demonstrate the important role of rotations in both cases .",
    "we also examine the validity of the effective medium approximation , by comparing the calculations using discrete and effective medium models .",

    "the findings described above invite several questions , including whether our model of a square lattice is applicable to results on hexagonally packed monolayers , and why horizontal - rotational resonances were not observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "we believe that the assumption of the square lattice is not essential . for isolated spheres , eqs .",
    "( [ eom_cont ] ) and ( [ bc ] ) with @xmath43 and @xmath44 set to zero can be obtained for any arrangement of the spheres , periodic or random , with the only parameter depending on the arrangement being the surface area per sphere a. for interacting spheres , the results generally do depend on the lattice structure and the propagation direction .",
    "however , the contact resonances given by eq .",
    "( [ res_longwave ] ) correspond to the @xmath148 limit and , consequently , do not depend on the propagation direction .",
    "the relative positions of the three contact resonances may be different in the long wavelength limit between a hexagonal and square packed lattice , but their presence should still be expected in both cases .",
    "we suggest that the reasons why horizontal - rotational resonances were not observed in ref . @xcite may be the following .",
    "since the measurements were not sensitive to horizontal motion , the @xmath99 and @xmath100 resonances could only be detected when they hybridized with saws near avoided crossings , and since the avoided crossings with @xmath99 and @xmath100 resonances are more narrow than the one with the @xmath149 resonance , they could have been missed .",
    "furthermore , our model assumes that all spheres are either connected by identical springs or are isolated . if the contact stiffness between spheres were to vary widely ( some neighboring spheres being in contact and others not , for example ) , then distinct resonances may be absent .",
    "in addition , the upper ( @xmath99 ) resonance may have been outside the range of the measurements in ref . @xcite .",
    "further experimental studies of monolayer dynamics in conjunction with exploration of ways to control sphere - to - sphere contacts should help resolve the discrepancy between the theory and experiment .",
    "while the main focus of this work has been on microgranular monolayers , our theory is equally valid for macroscale systems . in this case , the contact springs would be determined by gravity and , possibly , applied lateral static compression @xcite , rather than by adhesion forces .",
    "we note that several past experimental works on macroscale granular systems @xcite have observed systematic upshifts in frequency relative to theoretical predictions , and have suggested uncertainties in material parameters and experimental setups , as well as deviations from hertzian contact behavior as possible causes . as per the results from our model ,",
    "the presence of additional degrees of freedom and interactions between spheres and substrate may also be possible causes . in the absence of the external lateral compression , highly nonlinear `` sonic vacua '' @xcite",
    "should also be expected .",
    "generally , as amplitudes are increased , interesting nonlinear dynamics are expected for both micro- and macroscale monolayers due to nonlinearity of hertzian contacts between the particles @xcite and between the particles and the substrate @xcite .",
    "we have developed a model for wave propagation in granular systems composed of a monolayer of spheres on an elastic substrate .",
    "our model expands on those used in previous works by including the elasticity of the substrate , horizontal and rotational sphere motions , shear coupling between the spheres and substrate , and interactions between adjacent spheres .",
    "we have shown that a monolayer of interacting spheres on a rigid substrate supports three modes involving vertical , horizontal , and rotational motion . in the long - wavelength limit , these modes yield three contact resonances , one purely vertical and two of mixed horizontal - rotational character . on an elastic substrate ,",
    "these resonances hybridize with the rayleigh surface wave yielding three avoided crossings . for isolated spheres",
    ", the frequency of the lower horizontal - rotational resonance , in the absence of bending rigidity , tends to zero and only two contact resonances with two respective avoided crossings remain .    by comparing the effective medium ( valid for long wavelengths ) to the discrete formulation of our model",
    ", we have demonstrated that for the presented microsphere monolayer example , the effective medium model can be used to describe the interaction of the contact resonances with the rayleigh waves in the substrate , but loses accuracy at shorter wavelengths . in that case , the substrate can be considered rigid , and the discrete model is more appropriate .",
    "this model is scalable in that it can be adapted for use with both macro- and microscale systems , and provides a means to experimentally extract contact stiffnesses from dynamic measurements .",
    "opportunities for future studies include exploration of analogous models for granular monolayers in the nonlinear regime , as well as analysis of the transverse modes of a monolayer of spheres on an elastic substrate ( the latter involves transverse horizontal displacement and rotations of the spheres , as well as shear horizontal acoustic waves in the substrate ) .",
    "further experiments with macro- and microscale granular monolayers will help guide the modeling effort .",
