    "olbers paradox  is one of astronomy s great mysteries .",
    "the conclusion that an infinite universe full of stars and galaxies produces an infinitely bright sky is over four hundred years old .",
    "the resolution of the paradox , an expanding and infinite universe with a finite age , is now a central tenet of big bang cosmology , where galaxy counts and the limiting sky background constrain the evolution of galaxies and the curvature of the universe ( e.g. , driver 1995 , 1996 , 1998 ; odewahn 1996 ) .",
    "here we show that local radiation sources , including the kuiper belt in our solar system , can also appear to violate olbers paradox .",
    "current limits on the sky background set interesting constraints on the mass and size distributions of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) .",
    "recent observations have detected many small icy bodies in our solar system outside the orbit of neptune ( @xcite ) .",
    "these kbos consist of three dynamical classes : ( 1 ) _ classical _ kbos with roughly circular orbits and semimajor axes of 4147 au , ( 2 ) _ resonant _ kbos , also known as plutinos , in orbital resonance with neptune ( jewitt , luu , & chen 1996 ) , and ( 3 ) _ scattered _ kbos with eccentric orbits , @xmath7 0.5 , and perihelion distances of 3038 au ( @xcite ) . for an adopted optical albedo , @xmath8 0.04 , kbos with red magnitudes ,",

    "all optical measurements of individual kbos are consistent with a simple function for the number counts :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the cumulative number of kbos per square degree .",
    "recent analyses indicate @xmath12 = 0.50.75 and @xmath13 = 23.223.5 mag in the kron - cousins photometric system ( @xcite ; jewitt , luu , & trujillo 1998 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these results imply a differential size distribution , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 = 3.54.5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the total mass in large kbos with radii 50500 km is @xmath16 0.10.2  for the classical and resonant kbos ( jewitt 1998 ; luu & jewitt 1998 ) and @xmath16 0.05  for the scattered kbos ( trujillo 2000 ) .",

    "our goal is to quantify the relationship between the optical number counts for bright kbos and the measured sky - surface brightness at optical and far - ir wavelengths . in  2 , we use equation ( 1 ) to relate the observed sky - surface brightness to the slope of the optical counts . in  3 , we derive a physical model relating observables to the kbo size distribution .",

    "if we solve equation ( 3 ) for @xmath36 , the thermal emission from kbos depends only on the albedo , the surface brightness , and the temperature :    @xmath48    for a fixed optical brightness , equation ( 4 ) predicts that hot kbos produce less thermal emission than cold kbos .",
    "this counter - intuitive result is correct , because hot kbos must have a smaller surface area to emit the same bolometric flux as cold kbos .    equation ( 4 ) has three main uncertainties . from the apparent spread in the optical colors of kbos ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ", the bolometric correction is uncertain by @xmath49 0.2 mag .",
    "large kbos and comets with @xmath8 0.04 ( e.g. , @xcite ) contribute little to the optical surface brightness or the thermal emission .",
    "if @xmath50 0.20.5 for the smallest kbo grains ( backman & paresce 1993 ; @xcite ) , @xmath51(fir ) is uncertain by a factor of 4 . small kbo grains with @xmath52 100  are inefficient radiators and are hotter than larger kbos at the same distance from the sun ( see backman 1995 ; teplitz 1999 ) . for constant @xmath36 , @xmath51(fir ) for small grains is a factor of 25 less than the limit in equation ( 4 ) .",
    "we conclude that equation ( 4 ) with @xmath35 = 0.5 and @xmath47 = 40 k is a reasonable estimate for thermal emission from kbos with optical number counts defined by equation ( 1 ) .",

    "the limits on optical and far - ir surface brightness require that the size distribution of kbos turns over for objects with @xmath52 10 m.    to allow for a shallower size distribution of small kbos , we consider the surface brightness distribution for number counts that follow a broken power law :    @xmath57    similar forms for broken power laws have been derived for other solar system bodies from observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and theory ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "to understand how the constraints on the optical counts relate to the size distribution of kbos , we construct a physical model for the observed surface brightness . we adopt a broken power law size distribution :    @xmath63    and assume objects are distributed in a ring around the sun with a surface density , @xmath64 .",

    "although specific predictions for the optical and far - infrared surface brightness are sensitive to other adopted parameters , our main conclusions are independent of these assumptions except as indicated below .",
    "the curves in figure 2 show how the optical and 100 @xmath3 m surface brightness increase with fainter kbo r - band magnitude for models with @xmath22 = 1.5 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 = 3.0 , 3.25 , and 3.5 .",

    "as expected , the larger albedo produces a brighter optical surface brightness , but a fainter far - ir surface brightness . for models with @xmath81 = 3.5 , kbos with a small constant albedo have a limiting optical surface brightness , @xmath16 24.5 mag arcsec@xmath19 , fainter than the observed sky brightness .",

    "the predicted far - ir surface brightness lies below measured limits at longer wavelengths .",
    "the far - ir surface brightness at 100 @xmath3 m flattens in figure 2 for r @xmath86 70 mag , because grains with @xmath52 100  radiate inefficiently and are too hot to emit much 100 @xmath3 m light .",

    "the optical and far - ir surface brightness place useful constraints on the size distribution of small kbos . to avoid violating olbers paradox at optical and far - ir wavelengths , the slope of the optical counts must change from @xmath91 0.6 at @xmath1 27 mag to @xmath62 0.48 at @xmath92 mag . with @xmath93 , the slope of the kbo size distribution must change from @xmath94 4 for @xmath95 10 km to @xmath96 3.4 for 1 m @xmath97 1 km .",
    "this conclusion is independent of assumptions about @xmath35 , @xmath47 , or the space distribution of kbos .",

    "the _ space infrared telescope facility _ can improve the far - ir constraints by a similar factor .",
    "the _ next generation space telescope _ will provide direct measurements of individual kbos near the proposed knee in the size distribution at @xmath85 2831 mag and more accurate background measurements in the optical and near - ir .",
