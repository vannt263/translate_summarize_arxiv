    "in rydberg states of alkali atoms the valence electron occupies a high lying orbit and is only loosely bound to the ionic core @xcite .",
    "this large displacement between the charges ( @xmath0 ) gives rise to a large atomic polarizability @xcite and strong interatomic interactions .",
    "this has been impressively demonstrated in an ultracold gas where atoms have been laser excited to rydberg states from their electronic ground state @xcite .",
    "the strong state - dependent interaction forbids the simultaneous excitation of two atoms when they are too close .",
    "this effect - the rydberg blockade - has potential application in quantum information processing @xcite , the preparation of many - particle states @xcite in optical lattices and the creation of non - classical light sources @xcite .    a coherently laser - driven gas of rydberg atoms constitutes an ideal specimen to study the complex many - body dynamics of a strongly interacting quantum system .",
    "the underlying hamiltonian can be formulated as a spin model @xcite whose properties are tunable through the laser parameters and the choice of particular rydberg states .",
    "the experimental realization of such a system has been achieved in several labs and the detection of rydberg atoms can be carried out with high efficiency .",
    "hence , observables such as the number of rydberg atoms can be recorded with high accuracy .",
    "a typical experiment starts with all atoms being initialized in the ground state .",
    "the laser which couples the ground to the rydberg state is turned on for a certain time @xmath1 after which the number of rydberg atoms is detected @xcite .",
    "each site is occupied by the same number of atoms @xmath2 and the atoms are resonantly coupled to a rydberg state by a laser with rabi frequency @xmath3 . the interaction strength between neighboring rydberg atoms",
    "is taken to be infinite .",
    "the next - nearest neighbor interaction is zero . the time is given in units of the inverse collective rabi frequency @xmath4 . ]",
    "the resulting signal is determined by the interplay between the laser driving and the strong state - dependent interaction @xcite .",
    "the typical appearance of the temporal evolution of the rydberg number @xmath5 obtained from theoretical studies @xcite is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : generic_rydberg_number ] . at small times",
    "( @xmath6 ) @xmath5 rises first quadratically in @xmath1 showing subsequently a number of oscillations with high contrast .",
    "after this transient period the oscillations diminish and @xmath5 approaches a constant value around which it performs small amplitude fluctuations which decrease with increasing system size .",
    "this general appearance is independent of the exact details of the system , e.g. the actual arrangement of the atoms and the boundary conditions . in experiments which are carried out in disordered gases the individual oscillations",
    "might not be observable since averaging over many experimental realizations also means averaging over many different spatial distributions of the atoms @xcite .",
    "each of these distributions gives rise to a different shape of the oscillating features in fig .",
    "[ fig : generic_rydberg_number ] and eventually the oscillations are washed out .    the steady state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : generic_rydberg_number ] is the result of a purely _ coherent dynamics of a closed system _ and does not come about due to dissipation stemming from the coupling to an external bath . in experiments",
    "a fundamental cause of dissipation would be radiative decay of atoms which typically occurs on a timescale @xmath7 .",
    "this is long compared to the time it takes to carry out the experiment @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , it is well - justified to neglect radiative decay in theoretical models of gases of rydberg - excited atoms when the time - evolution is restricted to time intervals smaller than @xmath9 . since any numerical treatment",
    "can only encompass a finite number of degrees of freedom , there is always a revival time @xmath10 after which the system returns to its initial state .",
    "the steady state which is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : generic_rydberg_number ] can thus be itself only a transient effect .",
    "however , in practice we have @xmath11 and thus the common theoretical models which consider only coherent dynamics are invalid for such long times .",
    "thus , the steady state we are referring to in this work exists in the time interval @xmath12 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the origin of this steady state which occurs as result of a purely coherent dynamics of a closed system .",
    "this subject is closely related to the discussion about how and why a closed system which is prepared in a pure state actually thermalizes .",
    "i.e. why and how does such system assume a state in which the mean values of macroscopic observables are stationary and why can these mean values be calculated from the microcanonical ensemble ?",
    "these questions are of fundamental interest @xcite and have been investigated in a number of systems @xcite .    in the present work it is particularly insightful to study the evolution of the atomic gas in excitation number space , i.e. between subspaces of the system s hilbert space which contain the same number of rydberg atoms . throughout",
    ", we employ the _ perfect blockade _ model of a rydberg gas which has been extensively discussed in refs . @xcite : two - level atoms ( ground state @xmath13 , rydberg state @xmath14 ) are confined to a ring lattice with @xmath15 sites .",
    "each site contains the same number ( @xmath2 ) of atoms , which occupy a single spatial mode and no tunneling between adjacent sites occurs .",
    "i.e. the external degrees of freedom are frozen out .",
    "a laser with rabi frequency @xmath16 couples @xmath14 and @xmath13 , resonantly .",
    "the interaction between rydberg atoms is so strong that the interaction energy of two atoms occupying the same site or adjacent sites is infinite .. ] the interaction between rydberg atoms being separated by two or more sites is zero .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom are the two internal states of the atoms located at individual sites , i.e. their measurement eventually determines @xmath5 . the state - dependent interaction in conjunction with the laser coupling , however , leads to such a strong mixing that perturbation theory in these physical degrees of freedom becomes meaningless . instead ,",
    "the eigenstates of the system are collective , delocalized excitations which contain no well - defined number of rydberg atoms . when studying the evolution in excitation number space under the action of the laser , we find that the strong interaction causes quasi - random couplings between regions of the hilbert space which contain a different ( and well - defined ) number of rydberg atoms .",
    "this randomness allows us to derive an effective equation for the time - evolution of the probability of being in a subspace with certain fixed excitation number .",
    "the resulting equation possesses a steady state which solely depends on the dimension of the excitation number subspaces .",
    "a comparison to the results obtained from the numerically exact propagation of the schrdinger equation shows good agreement .",
    "we consider atoms trapped in a ring - shaped one - dimensional lattice with @xmath15 sites .",
    "we will see , that despite its simplicity this model offers interesting insights into the dynamics of laser - driven rydberg gases which are usually carried out in a gas cloud .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the usual pauli spin matrices acting on the internal state of the atom located at site @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "we are interested here in atomic rydberg states that interact via the van - der - waals interaction .",
    "in this case we have @xmath27 and the parameter @xmath28 determines the interaction strength with @xmath29 being the van - der - waals coefficient @xcite and @xmath30 the lattice spacing .",
    "the transition @xmath31 is resonantly ( zero detuning ) driven with the rabi frequency @xmath16 . in case of a single atom per site @xmath16 is equal to the single atom rabi frequency @xmath3 .",
    "if each site is occupied by the same number ( @xmath32 ) of atoms @xmath16 corresponds to the collective rabi frequency @xmath33 . in this case the laser couples the product state @xmath34_1\\otimes ... \\otimes \\left[\\left|g\\right>_k\\right]_{n_0}$ ] to the superatom state @xmath35_1\\otimes \\left[\\left|g\\right>_k\\right]_2\\otimes ... \\otimes \\left[\\left|g\\right>_k\\right]_{n_0}\\right\\}$ ] ( @xmath36 is the symmetrization operator ) .",

    "we are now interested in the regime of the so - called _ perfect blockade _ which was introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this limit",
    "we replace the van - der - waals interaction by an interaction potential whose value is @xmath37 for nearest neighbors and @xmath38 for atoms which are further apart .",
    "this means that we effectively consider the case in which @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : working_hamiltonian ] ) is infinite .",
    "the perfect blockade model is then valid provided that @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath16 has to be much smaller than the nearest neighbor interaction but at the same time much larger than the next nearest neighbor interaction . in practice this means @xmath41 .",
    "for such a choice the further results , which will be obtained under the assumption of the perfect blockade , are virtually indistinguishable from those obtained for van - der - waals interacting atoms .",
    "such good agreement was also reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and is a speciality of the one - dimensional nature of our system ; for comparison : in two dimensions the perfect blockade model was valid provided that @xmath42 which is actually difficult to satisfy .",
    "the perfect blockade approach has the advantage that certain aspects of the system , e.g. its steady state and derived quantities , can be calculated analytically . within the _ perfect blockade _ the only states @xmath43",
    "which participate in the dynamics are those which satisfy @xmath44 the restriction to this set of states is the manifestation of the strong interaction among the rydberg atoms .",
    "the states @xmath43 can contain any number of rydberg excitations between @xmath38 and @xmath45 , which is the next integer smaller than @xmath46 .",
    "the laser hamiltonian @xmath22 can only couple states whose excitation number differs by one .",
    "moreover , due to the differences in the spatial distribution of the excitations only certain states are connected by the laser . a convenient way to illustrate",

    "( [ eq : rho_non_interacting ] ) here the wave packet exhibits coherent oscillations with large amplitude .",
    "we now proceed by monitoring @xmath146 over a time - interval in which the number of rydberg atoms shows the steady state behavior - here we choose @xmath147 .",
    "the result is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution_plots ] for two values of @xmath15 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the thin green curves show individual snapshots of @xmath146 taken at different times .",
    "in addition we present also the average of @xmath146 taken over the considered time - interval .",
    "the fluctuations around this average decrease significantly with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "this is in accordance with the behavior of the rydberg number @xmath5 whose fluctuations around the mean value also diminish as @xmath15 increases ( see ref .",
    "this supports the assumptions that in the limit of very large @xmath15 indeed a steady state with extremely little fluctuations is established . for both values of @xmath15 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution_plots ] a comparison to the steady state result ( [ eq : equilibrium_state ] ) ( thick red curve ) reveals a shift of the probability distribution to smaller @xmath67 .",
    "these deviations appear to stem from the particular choice of the initial state : the state @xmath150 is localized at the leftmost vertex of the network . in this region of the graph",
    "the matrices @xmath69 are , however , not actually random since the randomness is caused by the interaction which has little or no effect when the number of rydberg atoms is only very small , i.e. @xmath151 .    that this edge effect appears to be indeed the cause of the deviation of the probability distribution from @xmath152 is corroborated by the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution_plots_not_vac ] . here",
    "we present the same plot as in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution_plots ] but the initial state has to be chosen from the subspace containing 5 excitations , e.g. it is located in the central region of the graph .",
    "the effect is not only a much better agreement of the data with @xmath152 but also a significant decrease of the fluctuations about the average of @xmath146 .",
    "this behavior is generic for initial states chosen from excitation number subspaces with large dimensions .",
    "large deviations of the steady state from eq .",
    "( [ eq : equilibrium_state ] ) are again encountered when the initial state is located close to the right hand edge of the graph , i.e. when its number of rydberg atoms is close to @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution_plots_not_vac ] ) .",
    "hence , it becomes evident that eq .",
    "( [ eq : final_equation_for_rho ] ) is not unconditionally valid .",
    "it constitutes a reliable approximation only if the initial state belongs to a particle number subspace of sufficiently large dimension . that it also works well , when the vacuum is chosen as the initial state is not evident .",
    "so far we have only studied the probability density distribution in excitation number space .",
    "further insights can be gained by examining the reduced density matrix in excitation number space @xmath153 as this quantity eventually determines the outcome of a measurement of the number of rydberg atoms .",

    "[ fig : reduced_density_matrix ] we present a snapshot of @xmath155 for a system of @xmath149 sites at the time @xmath156 .",
    "the initial state was @xmath157 .",
    "we clearly observe that the entries of the main diagonal dominate the off - diagonal entries . hence",
    ", there is negligible coherence between excitation number subspaces which have a large dimension .",
    "consequently , the reduced density matrix is well approximated by a classical mixture @xmath158 .",
    "the strong interaction between the atoms in conjunction with the laser driving erases the phase relation between excitation number subspaces .",
    "so tracing out all degrees of freedom but those being relevant for the measurement of the rydberg number , leaves us with a density matrix of a completely mixed state .",
    "this gives actually the impression that the steady state we observe is a state with maximal entropy , since only the dimension of the excitation number subspaces determines the outcome of the measurement ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : equilibrium_state ] ) ) .",
    "in fact we are dealing with a pure state at all times and only the particular measurement we are performing gives us the impression of observing a completely mixed state .      note that all the information about the steady state could as well have been obtained by considering a microcanonical ensemble . here , the microstates are just given by the zero energy eigenstates @xmath159 of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath23 defined through condition ( [ eq : non_interacting_condition ] ) ) and the steady state given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_analytical ] ) can be obtained directly by counting the number of these microstates . the fundamental assumption underlying",
    "the microcanonical ensemble is that each of the microstates has equal weight .",
    "this assumption can clearly not be justified in the absence of the laser , even though all states have the same energy .",
    "only when the laser is present , the microstates @xmath159 defined by ( [ eq : non_interacting_condition ] ) ) become strongly mixed and are thus no longer eigenstates of the system . however , they no longer possess strictly zero energy but are rather distributed over an energy interval which is centered at zero and whose width is proportional to @xmath160 . in other words , although the laser produces a widening of the energy window occupied by the states , it also provides the necessary ingredient that eventually allows the system to thermalize , the equiprobability of the microstates .    at this point",
    "we want to remark that the microcanonical prediction to the steady state ( [ eq : rho_analytical ] ) involves all zero energy eigenstates of @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",
    "the numerical results of section [ txt : numerics ] involve only a subset of all accessible states , i.e. the fully symmetric set of eigenstates .",
    "the observed agreement between the two approaches suggests that the number of fully symmetric eigenstates with a given excitation number @xmath54 is proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "we have investigated the origin of the steady state value of the rydberg number which is exhibited in a laser driven rydberg gas after an initial transient period . starting from heisenberg s equation",
    "we have derived an effective equation of motion for the probability density in excitation number space .",
    "this effective equation of motion which is coarse - grained in time exhibits a steady state . when comparing this steady state to actual numerical simulations excellent agreement is found provided that the initial state was chosen from an excitation subspace with sufficiently large dimension . in case of an initial state containing a very small / large number of excitations still a steady state",
    "is established , however , deviations from the analytical result are obtained .",
    "we have visualized the system by a graph whose vertices are represented by eigenstates of the interatomic interaction .",
    "coupling between the vertices is established by the laser - atom interaction . a similar mapping",
    "was applied in refs .",
    "@xcite where interacting fermions were studied by means of a graph . here",
    ", a transition between localized and delocalized eigenstates has been found to take place as a function of the interaction strength . in our system",
    "we are in the regime of strong interaction and the eigenstates are delocalized throughout the entire graph .",
    "the observed localization in excitation number space and hence also the observation of a steady state value of @xmath5 is a purely statistical effect , owed to the strongly peaked function @xmath59",
    ".    it would be interesting to see whether a distribution of the rydberg number count similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : equilibrium_state ] ) and - more specifically - the calculated values for the mean rydberg number and the mandel q - parameter can be observed in actual experiments .",
    "studying the shape and the temporal evolution of the distribution should yield insights into how this steady state is established as the interaction strength increases . since our simple model is not expected to be valid in higher dimension experiments with rydberg atoms in lattices",
