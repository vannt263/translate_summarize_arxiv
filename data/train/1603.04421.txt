    "the psc astrometric accuracy is 7080mas : we assume a 0.1  ( @xmath21 ) astrometric accuracy to account for possible minor distortion in the image .",
    "we then corrected the astrometry of our two 300s exposures using the shallow exposure , and co - added the images .",

    "@xcite note that the radio luminosity measured by k16 , and the near - infrared colors of the host galaxy wisej071634.59@xmath16190039.2 , are consistent with that of a low - luminosity agn .",
    "we note that the radio source continues to vary even a year after the frb .",
    "@xcite reported a flux - density of @xmath24jy ( 5  ghz band ; 2016 feb 27/28 ) .",
    "our observations taken only six days later find the source to have decayed to 96@xmath258@xmath26jy .",
    "the fractional variation , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the flux - densities at the two epochs . ] between the two runs is @xmath29 . for comparison ,",
    "the maximum two - epoch fractional variation of k16flare in the k16 observations was @xmath30 .",
    "variability of @xmath31 has been seen in other agns @xcite . + we measure the radio luminosity of the putative host to be @xmath32ergs@xmath33hz@xmath33 .",
    "as shown by @xcite , it is not uncommon for elliptical galaxies without an optical signature of nuclear activity to harbor a low radio luminosity ( @xmath34ergs@xmath33hz@xmath33 ) agn .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum seen in figure  [ spec ] is flat across the entire band ( 118ghz ) and is consistent with that seen in several known agn samples @xcite .",
    "the spectral bumps are suggestive of multiple , compact , optically thick synchrotron components .",
    "variable radio emission from agn cores in the @xmath35ghz band is not unusual , and typically originates in relativistic shocks of compact jets at milli - arcsecond scales @xcite .",
    "+ alternatively , for a brightness temperature of @xmath36k that is typical of agn cores , the angular size of the radio source is about @xmath37as in size , which is comparable to the fresnel scale for galactic interstellar scattering .",
    "refractive interstellar scintillations are common in this regime , with variations of @xmath38 , on timescales of @xmath39 , with a broad bandwidth of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath41 is the transition frequency below which we expect interstellar scattering to be strong .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath42ghz for the low galactic latitude ( @xmath43deg ) of k16flare , yielding @xmath44 , and @xmath45days .",
    "thus , both the variability seen in k16flare and subsequent observations , and the smoothly undulating spectrum presented here , are also consistent with refractive interstellar scintillation ( see also @xcite for more detailed arguments . ) of a source with little or no intrinsic variability . finally , as can be seen from figure  [ optical ] , the radio source coincides with the light centroid of the putative host galaxy to within experimental errors , @xmath46 .",
    "+ we thus conclude that the simplest hypothesis explaining ( i ) the persistence of a @xmath47jy flat - spectrum source nearly a year after the k16 observation of k16flare , ( ii ) its continued variability on 6 day timescales , and ( iii ) the nuclear origin , is that k16flare was an example of agn variability ( intrinsic and/or extrinsic ) and is unrelated to the frb .",
    "despite this apparently compelling conclusion , in the next section , we explore observational constraints on possible frb afterglows from existing radio surveys for transients and variables .",
    "in the absence of any additional insight , we assume that k16flare is a prototypical frb afterglow ( @xmath48jy at 5.5ghz , spectral index of @xmath49 at maximum ) , and search for evidence of such afterglows in the vla radio variability surveys of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter m16 ) and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter f12 ) .",
    "details of these two surveys can be found in the appendix .",
    "we adopt a conservative all - sky frb rate of @xmath50 for fluence @xmath51jyms @xcite .",
    "+ since each frb afterglow lasts six days , in a survey whose cadence exceeds 6days , the expected slow - transient rate from frb afterglows is @xmath52deg@xmath53epoch@xmath33 .",
    "if all frbs have k16flare - like radio afterglows , the 50-square degree 3-epoch 3ghz survey of m16 should have yielded about fifty five afterglows .",
    "they found none with @xmath2 , and five with @xmath54 .",
    "next consider the the 944-epoch , 0.0225deg@xmath55 slow - transient 5-ghz survey analyzed by f12 .",
    "f12 should have seen eight afterglows ; they found just one .",
    "clearly , existing slow - transient surveys show that only a small fraction of frbs can generate k16flare - like afterglows . + to place limits on the fraction of frbs that can generate afterglows , in figure  [",
    "fig : poiss_post ] , we display the posterior probability density functions of the areal density of radio sources that vary on timescales of a week .",
    "the black vertical line shows the expected areal density of frb afterglows assuming that all frbs generate 6-day afterglows similar to k16flare .",
    "even if frbs are the only channel to create 6-day timescale transients , the slow - transient surveys limit the fraction of frbs that produce ( @xmath56jy ) afterglows to @xmath57 , for @xmath54 , and @xmath58 for @xmath59 with 95% confidence .",
    "therefore , if frbs produce afterglows , based on the measured average slow - transient rate , k16 had a @xmath60 chance of seeing an afterglow to frb150418 .",
    "our experience with frb150418 ( k16flare ) has informed us of the potential pitfalls in associating frbs with afterglows , particularly given the high all - sky frb rate .",
    "the areal density of 6-day frb afterglows at any given epoch ranges from @xmath61 ( frbs are not associated with afterglows ) to @xmath62 ( all frbs are associated with afterglows ) .",
    "depending on the fraction @xmath63 of frbs associated with afterglows , frb afterglows can therefore form an insignificant part of the transient sky , or completely dominate it . hence",
    ", blind slow - transient surveys can not be used to simply set a non - frb related background false positive rate for afterglow discovery .",
    "below , we outline a self - consistent approach for statistically relating frbs with afterglow candidates .",
    "+ let slow - transient surveys yield a transient background rate ( frb related or otherwise ) of @xmath64deg@xmath53epoch@xmath33 , and let frbs be localized to within @xmath65  deg@xmath55 .",
    "we wish to determine the fraction @xmath63 of frbs that yield afterglows . the detection of @xmath66 afterglow candidates in @xmath67 frb follow - ups will yield the estimate : @xmath68 .",
    "based on poisson statistics , the @xmath21 error on our estimate of @xmath63 will be @xmath69 for large @xmath66 .",
    "for instance , detection of @xmath70 transients in follow - ups , will constrain @xmath63 with about 10% fractional error ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "+ new surveys such as the vla sky survey @xcite will systematically explore the sub - mjy transient sky in the decimetric band and constrain the event background , @xmath64 . coincidentally",
    ", upcoming frb - machines such as chime @xcite and utmost @xcite are expected to discover a barrage of frbs ( @xmath71day@xmath33 ) . with the anticipated large frb sample with prompt follow - up , the above framework will enable a direct measurement of the fraction @xmath63 of frbs that are associated with transient afterglows .",
    "+ we finally note that , while a statistical argument for frb - afterglow association based on a large number of frb follow - ups will be compelling , future localization of an frb itself ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at a few arcsecond - level would imply an ( almost ) absolute confirmation of the host galaxy .",
    "we conducted radio and optical follow - up observations of the afterglow candidate to frb  150418 ( k16flare ) .",
    "we detected persistent radio emission from the host galaxy of k16flare @xmath3  year after the frb , which is nuclear in origin ( 0.1  astrometric precision ) , and has a flat radio spectrum ( 118ghz ) .",
    "it is therefore consistent with an agn core , and does not present prima facie evidence of being associated with frb150418 .",
    "+ if k16flare is nonetheless a prototypical frb afterglow , existing slow radio transient surveys limit the fraction of frbs that produce afterglows to @xmath57 for fractional variation of @xmath54 , and @xmath58 for @xmath59 ( 95% confidence ) . finally , keeping upcoming frb surveys in mind , we have presented a statistical framework to associate frbs with afterglow candidates , which will determine the fraction of frbs that produce afterglows .",
