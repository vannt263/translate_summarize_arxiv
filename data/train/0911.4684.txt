    "quantum entanglement plays an important role in the study of fundamental principles of quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "it is also the most important resource in quantum information processing@xcite . among all types of quantum entanglement , polarization entangled photon - pairs",
    "are particularly useful because of easy manipulation and transmission .",
    "there are many mature techniques to produce such entangled pairs _ _",
    "probabilistically__@xcite , while an _ on - demand _ entangled photon pair is essential in many tasks in quantum information processing .",
    "recently , an on - demand entangled photon - pair source was proposed@xcite and realized in a semiconductor quantum dot system@xcite .",
    "however , because of the fine - structure splitting ( fss ) there , the relative phase of the entangled state is randomized so that only classical correlation can be detected by traditional time - integrated measurement@xcite .",
    "so far , there are many methods proposed to explore this `` hidden entanglement''@xcite , for example , reducing fss@xcite , spectral filtering@xcite , time resolving post - selection@xcite , and so on . up to now",
    ", the smallest fss realized in experiment is about @xmath0 and non - classical nature of the radiation field is verified by directly observing violation of the bell inequality@xcite .",
    "however , the entanglement quality is considerably decreased even by very small fss , and further reducing fss is very difficult in experiment .",
    "furthermore , the severe restriction on fss greatly limits the selection range of quantum dot systems .",
    "certain quantum dots with large fss can not be used even if they have distinct advantage , such as emitting photons of frequencies in the easy transmission frequency window in free space or optical fiber .",
    "also , the post - selection method in frequency domain or time domain will significantly decrease the photon collection efficiency . to overcome all these drawbacks , stace et",
    "al proposed to use cavities to control the frequencies .",
    "latter , jones and stace proposed a more simplified , downstream solution of polarization - dependent frequency shift to the photons by an acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) .",
    "basically , there are 3 steps in the circuit : 1 ) split the polarization modes of each photons ; 2 ) shift the frequency of vertical polarization modes by aom ; 3)combine split beams by a polarization beam splitter . however , the efficiency of a normal commercially available aom is fairly low .",
    "the efficiency of a very good aom for a single photon is about @xmath1 .",
    "the joint efficiency of two photons in the scheme in ref.@xcite is not larger than @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , in the proposed set - up@xcite , special care has to be taken to make the two optical paths stable .",
    "say , a fluctuation of half a micro meter in any optical path will entirely destroy the result .",
    "here we propose another solution through using an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) .",
    "eom is a mature technique which has been demonstrated in many experiments . in particular ,",
    "two - photon interference has been experimentally observed@xcite very recently . in",
    "our proposed set - up , we use a dichroic mirror to separate the two photons , and then remove the position - dependent phase difference by using pockels cells under a ramping voltage . since a pockels cell itself makes the phase shift differently to different polarization mode , we do nt have to separate the different polarization modes as was proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "instead , we only need to separate the two photons . in this way ,",
    "compared with the existing proposal@xcite , our method has an advantage in its robustness to fluctuations of optical paths .",
    "as calculated later , a fluctuation of 1 mm will cause @xmath3 fluctuation in the phase .",
    "moreover , compared with ref.@xcite , our scheme seem to have a significantly higher efficiency .",
    "a commercially available pockels cell almost has no loss .",
