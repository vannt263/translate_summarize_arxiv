    "the experimental history of the @xmath0 decay begins in 1966 when @xmath4 momentum @xmath5 beam from cern proton synchrotron was used to produce @xmath6 mesons on a hydrogen target via charge exchange reaction @xmath7 @xmath6 meson was tagged by means of neutron time - of - flight measurement .",
    "the @xmath8-ray emission spectrum from the subsequent @xmath6 decays was measured by a lead glass cherenkov counter . as it was claimed in ref.@xcite",
    ", the observed @xmath8-ray spectrum could not be explained by @xmath9 and @xmath10 decay modes only .",
    "an equally intensive @xmath0 decay was required to get a good approximation of the measured spectrum .",
    "the next experiment carried out in brookhaven @xcite utilized a similar technique except for an order of magnitude higher incident @xmath5 beam momentum and a spark chamber as a @xmath8-ray detector .",
    "no @xmath11 signal was observed in the collected 4@xmath8 events .",
    "that was the beginning of the @xmath0 decay puzzle which lasted for the next 15 years .",
    "several other experiments were performed during this time @xmath12 $ ] , but the situation still remained unclear .",
    "the results of these experiments are shown in fig.[fig : br ] . for experiments that did not measure this branching ratio",
    "directly we calculated it using their results and current pdg table values for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "in many experiments the reaction ( [ eq : cher ] ) with rather low @xmath5 momentum @xmath15 was used as a source of @xmath6 mesons and optical spark chambers as @xmath8-ray detectors , as in @xcite . rather low detection efficiency for photons",
    "lead to a severe background from intense @xmath10 decay .",
    "this was clearly demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that despite the authors firm conclusion that all observed @xmath16 events in the @xmath6 peak were likely from the @xmath10 decay they presented an odd @xmath17 as their final result rather than just an upper limit .",
    "we mention this curious fact here only to show how great is sometimes the pressure of previously published results  a source of biases in high energy physics experiments not always appreciated .    high @xmath8 detection efficiency provided by heavy liquid bubble chamber techniques was also used in @xmath0 decay studies .",
    "for example , for a xenon bubble chamber an average @xmath8 detection efficiency was as high as 94% @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the chamber was irradiated by a @xmath18 beam and @xmath6 mesons were produced on quasi - free neutrons in the xenon nuclei through the reaction @xmath19 .",
    "experiment @xcite also used a xenon bubble chamber but @xmath20 reaction to produce @xmath6-s by an incident @xmath21 beam .",
    "a variation of this technique , a hydrogen target inside a heavy freon ( @xmath22 ) bubble chamber , was used in @xcite with the @xmath6 meson production reaction @xmath23 .",
    "it was again emphasized in @xcite that the experimental difficulty in the @xmath0 decay studies comes essentially from the @xmath10 background .",
    "let us mention also two other bubble chamber experiments , for completeness . in @xcite , @xmath24 beam at bnl alternate gradient synchrotron ( ags )",
    "facility was used to produce @xmath6 mesons in a hydrogen bubble chamber via reaction @xmath25 . in @xcite the @xmath26 reaction in a bubble chamber filled with liquid deuterium was used , @xmath27 beam provided also by ags .",
    "these bubble chamber experiments also produced controversial results .",
    "a real breakthrough in the field occurred in 1981 with gams experiment at serpukhov @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 mesons were produced again via the charge exchange reaction ( [ eq : cher ] ) .",
    "but now the incident @xmath5 beam momentum was @xmath28 .",
    "this incident energy increase dramatically improved the @xmath29 background suppression . in previous experiments",
    "low energy ( @xmath30 ) @xmath6-s were used , which means relatively high thresholds for @xmath8-ray detection .",
    "so two softest @xmath8-rays could easily escape unnoticed , and this is one possible mechanism for @xmath29 decay to mimic the desired @xmath0 decay . with increasing @xmath6 energies , relative threshold for @xmath8-ray detection",
    "gets lower , and so does the @xmath29 background .",
    "there is also another benefit of higher energies : higher invariant mass resolution of the detector for higher photon energies significantly improves suppression of the background .",
    "an order of magnitude lower upper limit @xmath31 ( at 90% confidence level ) was reported by this experiment .    in the next run of the same gams",
    "experiment a lower @xmath5 momentum @xmath32 was used .",
    "but because of improvements in the detector and accelerator performance significantly higher statistics was collected : about @xmath33 mesons produced via the charge exchange reaction ( [ eq : cher ] )",
    ". at last the @xmath0 decay was discovered with certainty @xcite . in the mass spectrum of the @xmath34 system a narrow @xmath6 peak",
    "was observed over a smooth background caused by the @xmath29 decay .",
    "the statistical significance of the effect was greater than seven standard deviations .",
    "the measured branching ratio was @xmath35 after about two years the same experimental statistics was reanalyzed with improved reconstruction program for @xmath8-rays from the showers in the gams spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the improvement provided better treatment of overlapping showers and allowed to reduce the background further .",
    "the new result was @xcite @xmath36    now some words on history of theoretical studies of the @xmath37 decay .",
    "to our knowledge , the first estimate of this decay rate was given by okubo and sakita in @xcite .",
    "they assumed that the following effective coupling @xmath38 was responsible for the decay . to estimate the value of the coupling constant @xmath39",
    ", they further assumed that the interaction ( [ eq : leff ] ) was also the source of the @xmath6-@xmath40 transition mass through the tadpole diagram which one obtains by contracting photon lines in the @xmath41 interaction vertex .",
    "the @xmath42 transition mass itself was estimated by using the unitary symmetry inspired mass formula .",
    "this approach was hampered by the fact that the tadpole diagram is badly divergent and one needs some cut - off to calculate its strongly cut - off dependent value . by taking the cut - off at the nucleon mass",
    ", they obtained @xmath43 .",
    "but the authors admitted that this estimate may easily be wrong by an order of magnitude .",
    "for comparison , the experimental result ( [ eq : br ] ) implies @xmath44 .",
    "after some years , it was shown in @xcite that vector meson dominance model ( vdm ) with trilinear meson interactions of the vvp and vpp type , previously successfully applied to the @xmath45 and @xmath46 decays @xcite , predicts too small ( @xmath47 ) ratio of the @xmath37 and @xmath46 decay widths , indicating @xmath48 .",
    "so it became clear that a large rate for the @xmath37 decay , which was reported by several experiments at that time , caused some theoretical embarrassment .",
    "as a possible way out singer suggested in @xcite a rather strong quadrilinear vvpp meson interaction which can be dominating in the @xmath37 decay .",
    "the vdm model was further examined by oppo and oneda in @xcite .",
    "it was confirmed that this model predicts a small @xmath37 decay width in the @xmath49@xmath50 range .",
    "but the authors also indicated a possible additional contribution coming from a scalar meson intermediate state .",
    "there was very little experimental knowledge about scalar mesons at that time ( even nowadays scalar mesons still remain the most experimentally unsettled question in the low energy phenomenology ) . using chiral symmetry arguments",
    "gounaris @xcite estimated scalar meson contribution and obtained @xmath51 in excellent agreement with the present experimental result ( [ eq : br ] ) .",
    "but this correct experimental result then had years ahead to come .",
    "so the gounaris result was considered as a failure of the theory rather than success .",
    "some theoretical work followed @xcite which seemed successful in producing large enough decay width by using essentially scalar meson contribution . the new experimental situation @xcite , however , promptly depreciated all such attempts and stopped them forever .",
    "meanwhile it became increasingly evident that the chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking play crucial role in the low energy hadron phenomenology .",
    "this was culminated by creating a theoretical framework called chiral perturbation theory @xcite where the degrees of freedom used are the low - lying hadron states instead of useless in the low energy world ( current ) quarks and gluons .",
    "the situation here resembles @xcite theory of superconductivity : nobody questions the qed as underlying theory of all electromagnetic phenomena , but it does not help much while dealing with superconductivity .",
    "the reason is that electrons and photons are not adequate degrees of freedom for the superconductive phase .",
    "the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken due to presence of atomic lattice . the resulting goldstone bosons ( phonons )",
    "mediate the most important interactions .",
    "electron gets a dynamical mass and becomes quite different from the electron of the bare qed lagrangian . in the case of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) ,",
    "the goldstone bosons , associated with the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , are pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "so their interactions can be predicted to a great deal in the low energy limit .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the last chapter of our theoretical history is related to chpt .",
    "but at first let us mention some before - chpt - age papers , for completeness .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , unlikely to @xmath46 decay , baryon loop contribution vanishes for the @xmath37 decay in the chiral symmetry limit .",
    "pion loop contribution turned out to be very small @xcite . failing to find any large contribution in the @xmath37 decay rate in otherwise successful chiral model , the authors of @xcite suggested that something may be wrong with the experiment itself and soon the gams experiment showed that they were correct .",
    "right after this crucial experiment two papers appeared @xcite which calculated the @xmath37 decay width by using ( constituent ) quark loops to estimate various meson amplitudes .",
    "they obtained the correct magnitude of the decay width @xmath52 .    in chpt",
    "the @xmath37 decay was studied in @xcite .",
    "this decay is rather peculiar from the point of view of the chiral perturbation theory . in the momentum expansion ,",
    "the leading @xmath53 term is absent because there is no direct coupling of photons to @xmath40 and @xmath6 . due to the same reason the @xmath54 tree contribution is also absent .",
    "so for the @xmath37 decay chpt series starts with @xmath54 one - loop contributions . but",
    "these loop contributions are also very small .",
    "usually dominant pion loops are suppressed here because they contain g - parity violating @xmath55 vertex .",
    "kaon loops , although not violating @xmath56-parity , also give negligible contribution because of large kaon mass .",
    "it turned out that the main contribution comes from @xmath57 counterterms which are needed in chpt to cancel various divergences .",
    "the coefficients of these counterterms are not determined by the theory itself and should be fixed either from experimental information or by assuming that they are saturated by meson resonances ( vector meson exchange giving the dominant contribution ) . in @xcite the latter approach was adopted which gave @xmath58  too small compared to the experimental value ( [ eq : br ] ) .",
    "but , as was argued in @xcite , keeping momentum dependence in the vector meson propagators gives an `` all - order '' estimate ( that is @xmath57 and higher ) of the corresponding contribution of about @xmath59 , in agreement with the old vdm prediction @xcite .",
    "note that although the kaon loop amplitude alone is totally insignificant , its interference with the `` all - order '' vdm amplitude gives still small but noticeable contribution @xcite .",
    "there are also scalar and tensor meson contributions ( which signs can not be unambiguously determined ) and one - loop contribution at @xmath60 which is of the same order of magnitude as the @xmath54 contribution , because it does not violate g - parity .",
    "taking into account all these mechanisms , the final estimate of @xcite was @xmath61 some more details were given in @xcite but the result essentially remained unchanged .",
    "contributions of the c - odd axial vector resonances were considered in @xcite .",
    "these contributions increase ( [ eq : brchpt ] ) by about 10% . but",
    "this is still not enough to reconcile the chpt result ( [ eq : brchpt ] ) with the experiment .",
    "therefore it was suggested in @xcite that the resonance saturation assumption may not be valid for @xmath57 chiral lagrangian ( although it works quite well at @xmath54 ) .",
    "some indications about validity of this suggestion is provided by bellucci and bruno in @xcite .",
    "they calculated the coefficients of the @xmath57 counterterms in the framework of the extended nambu jona - lasinio model ( enjl ) and obtained @xmath62 it is higher than ( [ eq : brchpt ] ) and is in agreement with experiment within one standard deviation .",
    "however , the same coefficients when calculated by using another chiral effective lagrangian , obtained by a bosonization of the njl model , led @xcite to small decay width of the order of @xmath63 , while the @xmath64 experimental data were reproduced well .",
    "another analysis @xcite within the enjl model framework also produced rather small @xmath57 rate in the leading @xmath65 approximation @xmath66 on the contrary , nemoto et al .",
    "argued @xcite that the enjl model might be quite successful in explaining experimental @xmath37 width if one includes instanton induced 6-quark interactions , which lead to a strong @xmath67 breaking and nonstandard @xmath6-@xmath68 mixing angle close to zero .    as we have seen , @xmath37 decay has dramatic , both experimental and theoretical , history . and the story is by no means over yet . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", this decay provides unique possibility to probe higher order effects in chpt .",
    "but at present these effects can not be calculated without model ambiguities .",
    "and the situation will hardly change until more precise and detailed experimental data appear .",
    "such data about @xmath37 decay are also highly desirable for understanding other interesting rare decays , such as @xmath69 @xcite ( in which , it is believed , a signal of the direct cp - violation can be observed ) and @xmath70 @xcite ( which is a sensitive probe of c - conservation in the electromagnetic interaction of hadrons ) . despite considerable experimental effort ,",
    "only one reliable measurement of the @xmath71 decay rate exists at present .",
    "therefore @xcite , `` a re - measurement of the decay rate and a measurement of the decay distributions is certainly desirable '' .",
    "the snd detector ( fig.[fig : snd ] ) is a general purpose nonmagnetic detector which successfully operates at the vepp-2 m collider @xcite since 1995 . the detailed description of this detector and some of its subsystems can be found elsewhere @xcite , and will be not repeated here .",
    "but maybe it is worthwhile to mention some features of the snd calorimeter , because this subsystem is crucial in the analysis like one presented in this article .",
    "the snd calorimeter consists of 1630 nai(tl ) crystals with a total weight of @xmath72 .",
    "crystals are assembled in three spherical shells with solid angle coverage @xmath73 of @xmath74 .",
    "each calorimeter layer includes 520560 crystals of eight different shapes .",
    "the total thickness of the calorimeter is @xmath75 ( 35  cm ) of nai(tl ) .",
    "the calorimeter was calibrated by using cosmic muons @xcite and @xmath76 bhabha events @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the calorimeter energy resolution on photon energy is shown in fig.[fig : enr ] .",
    "this dependence can be fitted as : @xmath77{e(\\mathrm{gev})}}.\\ ] ] several effects influence the energy resolution , such as passive material before and inside the calorimeter , leakage of shower energy through the calorimeter , electronics instability and calibration inaccuracy , light collection nonuniformity over the crystal volume .",
    "reasonably good agreement between simulated and measured energy resolutions was achieved after all these effects were duly taken into account in the simulation .",
    "an average energy deposition for photons in the calorimeter is about 93% of their initial energy .",
    "high granularity of the calorimeter ensures rather good angular resolution for photons .",
    "a novel method for reconstruction of photon angles was suggested in @xcite .",
    "it is based on an empirical finding that the distribution function of energy deposition outside the cone with the angle @xmath78 around the shower direction has the following form for electromagnetic showers in the snd calorimeter ( according to simulation ) @xmath79{\\theta/\\beta } ) , \\label{eq : trprof}\\ ] ] where the @xmath80 and @xmath81 parameters turned out to be practically independent of the photon energy over the interval @xmath82 mev .",
    "fig.[fig : anr ] shows the calorimeter angular resolution as a function of photon energy .",
    "this energy dependence can be approximated as @xmath83{e(\\mathrm{gev } ) } } \\oplus 0.63^\\circ.\\ ] ]    high granularity also enables to discriminate merged photons in the calorimeter by examining energy deposition profile of the corresponding electromagnetic shower in transverse direction .",
    "merging of photons is the main mechanism for @xmath29 decays to imitate the desired @xmath84 process ( another one is a loss of photons through openings in the calorimeter ) .",
    "so , for background suppression , it is very important to recognize merged photons . in @xcite a parameter was suggested to separate hadronic and electromagnetic showers in the snd calorimeter by comparison of actual transverse energy profile of the shower with the expected one ( [ eq : trprof ] ) for a single photon .",
    "the same parameter also helps to discriminate merged photons .",
    "the results presented in this article are based on the statistics collected by snd in two experiments .",
    "the first one was carried out in the time period from february 1996 until january 1997 .",
    "seven successive scans were performed in the center of mass energy range from 980 to 1044 mev .",
    "data were recorded at 14 different beam energy points .",
    "collected statistics was almost tripled during the next experiment in 19971998 .",
    "it consisted of three scans at 16 energy points in the interval from 984 to 1060 mev .",
    "the total integrated luminosity used in this work is equal to @xmath85 and corresponds to about @xmath86 mesons produced .",
    "the corresponding number of @xmath6 mesons from @xmath87 decay is @xmath88 .",
    "the collider luminosity was measured using the process @xmath89",
    ". systematic error of the luminosity measurement estimated using @xmath76 reaction is close to 3% .",
    "the general form of the @xmath90 transition amplitude as a function of particle momenta and photon polarization vectors is dictated by gauge invariance , bose symmetry , and cp - conservation @xcite : @xmath91,\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are lorentz - invariant form factors , which are symmetric functions of dimensionless variables @xmath94 two independent gauge - invariant tensors are defined as @xmath95 @xmath96    if cp is not conserved two more gauge - invariant structures containing @xmath97 ( pseudo)tensor appear @xcite .",
    "however we can safely neglect tiny effects associated with additional form factors .",

    "vector meson exchange @xmath104 gives the most significant contribution .",
    "the corresponding form factors have the following form @xcite @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 in the model considered in @xcite , which we choose as the base for our monte carlo simulation , scalar meson exchange @xmath109 contribution was also taken into account . if @xmath110 is considered as a point - like source of photon emission then only @xmath92 form factor acquires additional contribution from this mechanism @xmath111}.\\ ] ] for the coupling constants we take their central values from ref.@xcite , where they were extracted from the experimental information on various decay widths .",
    "the relative sign of the vdm and @xmath110 exchange amplitudes can not be determined this way .",
    "we have chosen constructive interference between them because the experimental width is larger than vdm prediction .",
    "the following resulting values were used in the simulation : @xmath112 @xmath113 as a check of the simulation program , we reproduced the result of ref.@xcite for the decay width @xmath114 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dgamma ] ) can be rewritten in a form more convenient for simulation .",
    "the @xmath115-function ( or energy - momentum conservation ) enables us to perform a trivial integration over @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( where @xmath118 is the angle between @xmath119 and @xmath120 3-vectors ) and get in the @xmath6-meson rest frame : @xmath121 @xmath122 which were defined earlier , in the @xmath6-meson rest frame coincide with photon energies divided by @xmath6-meson mass . @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the first photon polar and azimuthal angles in the @xmath6 meson rest frame and @xmath125 is the second photon azimuthal angle in the plane perpendicular to the first photon momentum @xmath119 .",
    "in fact the integrand in ( [ eq : dgamma1 ] ) after taking into account the energy - momentum conservation depends only on @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "it is convenient , however , to introduce another angular variable instead of @xmath127 in the following way .",
    "let @xmath128 be a rest frame of the system consisting of @xmath40 and the second photon .",
    "of course this system moves in the direction opposite to the @xmath119 if initial @xmath6 decays at rest . for the energy @xmath129 and invariant mass @xmath130 of the @xmath131 system we get easily @xmath132",
    "therefore the lorentz factor of this system is @xmath133 the energy of the second photon @xmath134 in the @xmath128 reference frame is uniquely determined by @xmath130 and hence by @xmath126 : @xmath135 but its direction is arbitrary .",
    "let us denote the polar and azimuthal angles ( @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) of the second photon in @xmath128 as @xmath138 and @xmath136  as an angle between the velocity 3-vector of the reference frame @xmath128 and the direction of the second photon .",

    "we must consider other quark - loop diagrams also in the framework of some self - consistent model ( for example enjl model ) with realistically broken chiral symmetry .",

    "a primary selection of the candidate events for the process @xmath178 was done according to following criteria :    * an event must have no charged particles and contain exactly 5 photons in the calorimeter ; * the azimuthal angle of any final photon lies within the interval @xmath179 ; * the energy of the next to the most energetic photon is less than @xmath180 , @xmath181 being a beam energy ; * the total energy deposition of final photons is in the range @xmath182 ; * the normalized full momentum of the event ( @xmath183 ) is less than 0.1 ;    the third condition is against qed background @xmath89 , with extra photons originating either from the beam background or splitting of electromagnetic showers in the calorimeter .",

    "fig.[fig : xinm ] shows distributions over the parameter @xmath199 for simulated signal events ( [ eq : etpgg ] ) and background ( [ eq : eta3pi ] ) .",
    "the efficiency of this parameter in the background suppression is clearly demonstrated by this figure .",
    "we require @xmath200 which reduces background ( [ eq : eta3pi ] ) by about six times .",
    "fig.[fig : xinm ] also shows that almost all background remaining after our cuts comes from the process ( [ eq : eta3pi ] ) .",
    "in particular the background from the reaction ( [ eq : ompi ] ) seems to become insignificant after application of described above selection criteria .",
    "but unfortunately it is very difficult to suppress the background ( [ eq : eta3pi ] ) any further without significant improvement of the detector performance ( angular and energy resolution for photons ) .",
    "so the only option left for us is to subtract the remaining background ( [ eq : eta3pi ] ) relying upon the monte carlo simulation .    for this purpose ,",
    "special kinematic fit was performed for selected events .",
    "it was assumed in the fit that four of five photons in each event are from the @xmath84 decay .",
    "of course there are many possibilities how to divide five photons into the recoil photon from the @xmath87 decay , two photons from the subsequent @xmath143 decay , and two photons from the @xmath201 decay .",
    "the best combination was selected for each event during the fit .",
    "@xmath185 of the fit ( @xmath202 ) is small for desired events from ( [ eq : etpgg ] ) , while background ( [ eq : eta3pi ] ) has wider distribution .",
    "fig.[fig : zxi2 ] shows @xmath202 distribution for 170 experimental events left after the above described cuts with one more condition @xmath203 the simulated background from the process ( [ eq : eta3pi ] ) has similar distribution over this parameter .",
    "signal and background composition of our data sample was estimated by using binned maximum likelihood method incorporating the finiteness of the monte carlo statistics @xcite .",
    "using hmcmll routine from the hbook package @xcite , the experimental histogram was fitted by the sum of two monte carlo histograms for the signal ( [ eq : etpgg ] ) and background ( [ eq : eta3pi ] ) . as a result of this fit , the signal events fraction in the experimental data , depicted in fig.[fig : zxi2 ] , was found to be @xmath204 .",
    "this corresponds to the total number of signal events of the process ( [ eq : etpgg ] ) @xmath205 , where the asymmetric errors correspond to the 68.27% confidence interval determined according to table 10 from @xcite .",
    "number of background events from this fit @xmath206 is in a good agreement with the prediction of simulation @xmath207 .    to transform @xmath208 into the branching ratio ,",
    "we need a detection efficiency for signal events .",
    "this efficiency determined from simulation of the effect with vdm matrix element is @xmath209 .",
    "the quark - box matrix element gives almost the same value @xmath210 .",
    "therefore the systematic error coming from model ambiguity is negligible in comparison with the inaccuracy in the background subtraction .",
    "the monte carlo detection efficiency was corrected for a loss of events due to additional beam background photons causing signal events to be rejected by the selection cut requiring exactly 5 photons in an event .",
    "this effect not modelled in the simulation was as large as 5% in the first snd experiment and 8% in the second one with a twice larger statistics .",
    "thus as an average corrected detection efficiency for signal events we took @xmath211 with the model ambiguity also taken into account .",
    "the number of @xmath6 mesons in our initial data sample is @xmath88 with a 3% systematic error due to limited accuracy of the luminosity determination . given above values for @xmath208 and @xmath212",
    "we get the branching ratio @xmath213 since the error is very large only an upper limit of the branching ratio can be determined from our data : @xmath214 where we have again used table 10 from @xcite , according to which the measured mean of @xmath215 implies 90% c.l .",
    "interval @xmath216 for the mean @xmath217 of a gaussian constrained to be non - negative .",
    "the systematic error caused mainly by inaccuracy of the simulated @xmath199-distribution was estimated to be less than 20% which is negligible in comparison with the statistical error . to check consistency of this particular background subtraction procedure",
    "we have tried another approach .",
    "the @xmath218 region in the experimental histogram of fig.[fig : zxi2 ] was divided into two bands : 1  with @xmath219 and 2  with @xmath220 let @xmath221 and @xmath222 be the numbers of experimental events in the corresponding bands",
    ". then we can write @xmath223 where @xmath224 are the numbers of signal and background events in the whole region @xmath218 , @xmath225 is the fraction of signal events from this region belonging to the band 1 , and @xmath226 is the fraction of the background events belonging to the band 2 .",
    "the values of @xmath227 and @xmath226 were determined by simulation . after that @xmath208 and @xmath228 can be easily calculated from ( [ eq : n12 ] ) .",
    "the results of this procedure for various choices of @xmath229 are listed in the table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "ccccc @xmath229 & 5 & 10 & 15 & 20 + @xmath227 & @xmath230 & @xmath231 & @xmath232 & @xmath233 + @xmath226 & @xmath234 & @xmath235 & @xmath236 & @xmath237 + @xmath221 & @xmath238 & @xmath239 & @xmath240 & @xmath241 + @xmath222 & @xmath242 & @xmath243 & @xmath244 & @xmath245 + @xmath208 & @xmath246 & @xmath247 & @xmath248 & @xmath249 + @xmath228 & @xmath250 & @xmath251 & @xmath252 & @xmath253 +    note that , according to statistically more powerfull previous method , the number of the @xmath84 events is @xmath254 and simulation predicts @xmath207 background events .",
    "these numbers are consistent with @xmath208 and @xmath228 from the table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "fig.[fig : egr ] shows recoil mass of the most energetic photon for experimental events with @xmath255 .",
    "@xmath6-meson signal is clearly seen , but this signal is still vastly populated by the background ( [ eq : eta3pi ] ) . as our last resource to extract the @xmath84 decay signal from the background , let us try to use peculiarities of the pion energy spectrum in this decay . in the @xmath6 meson rest frame , this energy spectrum is moderately peaked at high energies .",
    "this is true for both vdm and quark - box models , although in the latter case the effect is somewhat less prominent .",
    "fig.[fig : xf ] shows distributions over the parameter @xmath256 , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are normalized over @xmath257 photon energies in the @xmath6 meson rest frame .",
    "so @xmath258 is in fact the normalized pion energy in this frame .",
    "the hole in the distribution near @xmath259 is caused by our selection criteria , which are against the presence of the second @xmath40 in an event .",
    "indeed , the photon pair has invariant mass @xmath260 .",
    "so , demanding single @xmath40 in an event we exclude some region near @xmath261 .",
    "fig.[fig : xf ] shows the spectra without @xmath262 cut , although all other selection criteria described above were applied .",
    "but higher @xmath258 , which we are interested in now , means softer photons .",
    "so the probability of superimposed beam background photons increases . to exclude this background , we demand @xmath255",
    ". then only 6 experimental events are left in the @xmath263 region , while the simulation predicts @xmath264 background events and @xmath265 signal events , for the branching ratio ( [ eq : br ] ) .",
    "so what is observed is consistent with what is expected , but again only an upper limit can be established with certainty .",
    "the detection efficiency for signal events according to monte carlo is ( decreased by 7% to correct beam background related systematics as explained earlier ) 1.5% for vdm and 1.3% for quark - box model .",
    "then our 6 observed event with a mean background of @xmath266 indicate the following 68.27% c.l .",
    "interval , according to feldman and cousins table 2 @xcite @xmath267 systematic errors are potentially large . we do not scrutinize them because the signal is not statistically significant anyway .",
    "our investigation once more clearly demonstrates experimental difficulties in @xmath84 decay studies caused mainly by the background ( [ eq : eta3pi ] ) .",
    "our analysis yields the value of the @xmath84 branching ratio ( with systematic error not grater than 20% ) @xmath268 which is consistent with a more accurate result of gams @xcite : @xmath269 , but shows an urgent need of new high precision measurements . as a final result we present an upper limit : @xmath270 leaving open the question whether chpt has problems with this decay . nevertheless , we think that the investigation presented in this paper demonstrates feasibility of such studies in future high statistics collider experiments .",
    "let us remind in this respect that @xmath6 mesons will be copiously produced at @xmath271-factories , for example , about @xmath272 @xmath87 decays per year are expected at da@xmath273ne @xcite .",
    "we hope that this article will stimulate future investigations at @xmath271-factories and will be useful in such studies .",
