    "direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the equations governing turbulent phenomena have now become an important tool in both research and applications .",
    "faithful results require the equations to be solved on a grid of adequate resolution .",
    "most solutions of the past adopt a standard resolution based on an average measure of the smallest scale estimated from dimensional considerations .",
    "our purpose here is to show , for the case of turbulent mixing , that such standard measures do not resolve a range of very fine scales that are present in reality .",
    "we demonstrate the essentials of this feature by performing several numerical simulations whose resolution is much finer than that adopted routinely , and comment on the practical relevance of the scales missed in past calculations .",
    "we focus on the practically important case of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the schmidt number , @xmath2 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and @xmath3 the scalar diffusivity .",
    "the smallest scale of mixing is generated by the balance of turbulent stretching and diffusion ( batchelor 1959 ) , and is related to the kolmogorov scale @xmath4 through the identity @xmath5 ; here , @xmath6 is the average value of the instantaneous ( and local ) energy dissipation rate @xmath7 of the turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "the expression for @xmath7 reads as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the velocity fluctuation in the direction @xmath10 . in simulations of a fixed size , in which the advection diffusion equation and the navier - stokes equations are simultaneously solved ,",
    "the largest scale has traditionally been maximized by resolving no more than @xmath11 .",
    "resolving this scale is also the goal of most experimental efforts , though they often fall short for large pclet numbers @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , are the characteristic large - scale velocity and length scale of the flow .",
    "however , since the time it was realized that the local energy dissipation rate @xmath7 has a multifractal character ( e.g. , sreenivasan & meneveau 1988 ) , and that its average value @xmath6 is therefore not adequate for quantifying small - scale characteristics ( grant , stewart & moilliet 1962 ) , it has been clear that , locally , length scales smaller than @xmath15 appear in a flow .",
    "this is obvious from the definition of the _ local _ kolmogorov scale @xmath16 , in which @xmath17 is a highly fluctuating variable : the larger the value of @xmath7 locally , the smaller is the local kolmogorov scale @xmath18 , and vice versa . in view of the relation between the _ local _ values of the batchelor and kolmogorov scales , namely @xmath19 ,",
    "it becomes similarly apparent that the existence of very small values of @xmath18 may lead to @xmath20 values that are much smaller than the average value @xmath11 .",
    "this intuitive ( and incomplete ) reasoning will be supplemented by further explanation momentarily , but it is enough to note here that such fine scales have not been explored before .",
    "section 2 presents a brief description of the simulations and resolution effects , and the main results are stated in section 3 .",
    "this is followed by a discussion in section 4 of how the finest dissipation filaments are generated .",
    "conclusions are stated in section 5 .     and",
    "@xmath21 , as indicated in the legend . in ( b ) we have fitted the data by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 as in chen _",
    "( 1993 ) . ]",
    "the advection - diffusion equation for the passive scalar is solved together with the navier - stokes equations for the homogeneous and isotropic turbulent velocity field .",
    "the simulations are carried out within periodic boxes of fixed size @xmath26 .",
    "the flow is maintained stationary by a random volume forcing .",
    "the passive scalar is rendered stationary through a mean scalar gradient in the @xmath27-direction . except for enhanced resolution , about which some comments follow , the pseudo - spectral methods used here are quite standard ( schumacher & sreenivasan 2003 ; vedula , yeung & fox 2001 )",
    ".    for dns of box - type turbulence on an @xmath28 grid based on pseudo - spectral methods control of alias errors requires that modes with wavenumber higher than @xmath29 be truncated ( patterson & orszag 1971 ) .",
    "specifically , this removes double and triple aliases in three dimensions .",
    "the usual resolution criterion is expressed as a number for @xmath30 which , by extension to cases with @xmath31 , is @xmath32 a proper resolution of the smallest scale requires that the global minimum of @xmath20 be resolved by the grid which can be written as @xmath33}{\\delta}\\ge 1\\ , .",
    "\\label{criterion1}\\ ] ] by comparing ( 2.2 ) with the usual resolution criterion ( [ criterion0 ] ) , we get @xmath34 where we used @xmath35 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is apparent that the criterion ( [ criterion1 ] ) is stronger",
    ". our simulation will satisfy ( [ criterion1 ] ) and its results will be compared with data from those with nominal grid resolution .",
    "unfortunately , the demands of this fine resolution restrict us to rather low values of the reynolds number ( @xmath36 , see table  1 for details ) .",
    "this necessitates that most of our flow scales are in the viscous range of turbulence .",
    "figure  [ spec](a ) shows the energy spectrum for @xmath37 , evaluated with two resolutions , @xmath38 and 512 .",
    "it is seen that the noise floor is reached some 30 orders of magnitude below the peak signal . in figure  [ spec](b ) , we verify that the energy spectrum in the far - dissipation range falls off as @xmath22 with @xmath23 . for the lower reynolds number case , one gets @xmath24 and @xmath25 as did chen _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) for the same range of dissipative wavenumbers ; this range is indicated by the two vertical dotted lines in the figure .",
    ".parameters of the numerical simulations .",
    "@xmath39 is the ( equidistant ) grid spacing .",
    "the integral length scale for the velocity field is @xmath40 and that for the scalar field is @xmath41 ; here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the spectral densities of the velocity and scalar fields , respectively , @xmath44 is the mean square of the velocity in the @xmath45-direction , and @xmath46 that of the passive scalar .",
    "@xmath47 is the averaging time in units of the large scale eddy turnover time @xmath48 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    of particular interest is the nature of the velocity field near the most intense or the least intense parts of the scalar dissipation .",
    "this was examined through the eigenvalue analysis of the velocity gradient at sites where @xmath49 exceeded or fell below a chosen threshold .",
    "trends with @xmath1 were discussed by schumacher & sreenivasan ( 2003 ) , but here we focus only on the highest schmidt number . the results of table 2 show that the pure straining motion ( three real eigenvalues ) and rotation ( complex conjugated pair of eigenvalues ) contribute to low amplitude scalar dissipation . it may be thought that the scale @xmath50 of maximum dissipation is related closely to the most compressive strain events , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "the present data for all levels of @xmath52 , some of which are reported in table 2 , indicate that this is not so .",
    "indeed , a broad range of compressive rates  not merely the maximal magnitudes  are associated with intense scalar dissipation .",
    "this is already apparent from the analysis of ashurst _",
    "( 1987 ) ( see their figure 9b which reports an isotropic flow for sc=0.5 ) . while the most compressive eigenvector was preferentially aligned with the direction scalar gradient , corresponding events of maximum @xmath53 were preferentially aligned at an angle of about @xmath54 .",
    "we explicitly note that this is the eulerian point of view , and that a lagrangian analysis following incipient fronts to the stage of their maturity may yield a different result .",
    "the possibility that the resolution requirement could be more stringent than is conventionally believed has been discussed to some detail in sreenivasan ( 2004 ) , but the details outlined in the present paper have not been explored before .",
    "when there is a significant overlap of the intermediate dissipation with the viscous - convective range , extreme values of the scalar dissipation are determined by the roughest velocity increments of the inertial range of turbulence .",
    "an important example in which these fine scales would make a difference is non - premixed turbulent combustion ( bilger 2004 ) . there , the scalar dissipation rate of the mixture fraction enters as a basic quantity , e.g. for the modelling of jet - diffusion flames .",
    "chemical reactions take place at the stochiometric mixture fraction in sheets of sub - kolmogorov thickness .",
    "one expects steep gradients across such layers and strongly varying scalar dissipation .",
    "these variations are not captured in the flamelet equations where only the statistical mean enters the expansion parameter ( peters 2000 ) .",
    "a broad example where resolution effects can be important is the multifractal scaling of @xmath7 and @xmath53 .",
    "the spiky structures in space and time , which are most prominent in the dissipative scales , are thought to affect appropriate turbulent field even for scales larger than @xmath18 or @xmath20 , as appropriate ( frisch 1995 ) .    to summarize",
    ", the very fine scalar filaments that were resolved here do not seem to be associated with the most intense scalar dissipation .",
    "the small - scale stirring in the flow seems to interrupt a further steepening process which is known as the formation of mature fronts .",
    "similar findings were made for two - dimensional turblence at @xmath55 ( celani _ et al .",
    "clearly , the reynolds number of the advecting flow has an impact on this issue simply because the intermediate dissipation range might `` overshadow '' the viscous - convective range completely for sufficiently large @xmath56 .",
    "a more conclusive study of this issue will require higher reynolds numbers and will be part of future work .",
