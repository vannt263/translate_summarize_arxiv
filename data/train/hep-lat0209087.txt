    "consider an abelian gauge theory defined on a hypercube of size @xmath2 and periodic boundary conditions . in the continuum",
    "the definition of flux through any @xmath3 plane is the following : @xmath4 this quantity , because of periodic boundary conditions , is @xmath5 valued ( @xmath6 ) , and configurations with different @xmath7 values are topologically disconnected ( so we talk of topological superselection @xmath8 ) .",
    "consider now the same system , but with a discretized space - time .",
    "the definition of flux is now @xmath9_{-\\pi,\\pi}\\ ] ] where @xmath10_{-\\pi,\\pi}$ ] is the plaquette angle reduced to the interval @xmath11 , its so called @xmath12 part .",
    "a double sum is present : the internal @xmath13 is the sum over the plaquettes in a single @xmath3 plane ; this quantity is a multiple of @xmath14 , as in the continuum case .",
    "but when we consider the external average over all parallel planes , we observe that the flux can change from plane to plane , due to the presence of @xmath15 , specific to the lattice , so that the allowed values for @xmath16 are multiples of @xmath17 .",
    "having in mind the continuum limit , configurations whose flux is @xmath18 play a special role : in fact @xmath19 between different ` sectors ' is now possible , but higher and higher barriers are expected between them as @xmath20 .",

    "we work with the following action @xmath21 @xmath22 is the wilson coupling .",
    "this model was introduced by bhanot @xcite and has aroused interest also recently @xcite . in fig .",
    "1 we indicate three unknown aspects of the phase diagram with a question mark : + i ) the nature of the phase indicated with @xmath23 ; + ii ) the nature of the phase @xmath24 ; + iii ) the fate of the two phase boundaries in the bottom right corner of the phase diagram ( the same holds on the left side , due to the symmetry @xmath25 ) .",
    "let us consider the behavior of flux sectors across a phase boundary ; here we work on the wilson axis , but similar results hold everywhere .",
    "+ the numerical strategy is very simple : using a @xmath26 approach , we measure the values of the flux through one @xmath3 orientation along a monte carlo simulation and plot the ( inverse ) histogram of these measurements .",
    "the results are the following : + i ) in the coulomb phase flux sectors are well defined ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and as the thermodynamic limit is approached we observe higher and higher barriers between them .",
    "+ ii ) in the confined phase ( fig .",
    "3 ) the high density of monopoles hides the sectors and gives a gaussian flux distribution .",
    "if we check the thermodynamic limit , the distribution does @xmath27 change : in fact more and more planes are present ( this would give a narrower distribution ) , but also more and more monopoles ( which give a broader distribution ) and these two effects compensate each other .",
    "we extend to the abelian context the ideas of t hooft @xcite about non - abelian gauge theories : we probe the response of the system to a variation of the flux . in the context of @xmath28 pure gauge theories , we know that it is possible to modify the flux ( by twisting the boundary conditions ) according to the discrete group @xmath29",
    ". we can implement a similar modification also in the abelian context , but a continuous variation of the flux is now possible .",
    "our strategy is the following : we consider a @xmath30 of plaquettes , one in each plane of a given orientation , and on these we change @xmath31 , where @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "this corresponds to imposing an extra flux @xmath33 through the chosen orientation .",
    "the new partition function is @xmath34 and analogously away from the wilson axis ; @xmath35 is clearly @xmath14 periodic .",
    "we measure the free energy of the flux , @xmath36 .",
    "we make the following observations : + i ) in the coulomb phase we recover the @xmath14 sectors ( fig .  4 , upper curve ) .",
    "+ ii ) in the confined phase ( fig .  4 , lower curve ) , within our statistical error ,",
    "the free energy is independent of @xmath33 .",
    "this is due to the decoupling of flux values through different planes , so that the effects of the variation of the flux are screened .",
    "+ iii ) in the unknown phases @xmath37 we observe the appearance of an extra @xmath38 periodicity ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "we present an argument to interpret this result : consider the following quantity @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the polyakov loop of charge @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the unit vector in direction @xmath44 .",
    "this correlator is non trivial due to twisted b.c .. gauss law ( @xmath45 ) gives @xmath46 if @xmath35 has a @xmath38 periodicity , it follows that when @xmath47 , or more generally odd , the correlator is zero , while if @xmath41 is even , it can be different from zero .",
    "we then remember that @xmath48 , so we deduce that odd charges are confined ( in even combinations ) .",
    "we therefore claim that these two unknown phases @xmath37 are just coulomb phases for even charges .",
    "the last question we address regards the fate of the two phase boundaries at the lower corners of fig .",
    "1 . it is possible that they meet at some point or that they just become asymptotically close to each other .",
    "what we can exclude is that they end somewhere , letting the two different coulomb phases communicate .",
    "suppose that they communicate somewhere , then we expect the twisted free energy @xmath49 to be the same in both : this leads to a contradiction .",
    "in fact @xmath49 would have @xmath50 periodicity @xmath38 and @xmath14 at the same time .",
    "this is possible if the distribution is flat ; but this again implies confinement .",
    "we observe that in the literature about @xmath1 the issue of ergodicity through flux sectors is usually not considered , despite the early observation of @xcite ; in the region close to criticality this phenomenon could be relevant .",
    "possible perspectives of this work are the following : the signal related to the different periodicities of the partition function is very strong ; it is clearly visible on small lattices also at large @xmath22 .",
    "we can use it as a tool to study the position of the phase boundaries , and so to extend the quantitative picture of the phase diagram .",
    "+ secondly , we want to try an fss analysis of the quantity @xmath51 ( the free energy with twist - flux @xmath52 ) as we cross a phase boundary : indications about the nature of the phase transition ( @xmath53 or @xmath54 order ) could be obtained .",
