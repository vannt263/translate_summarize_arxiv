    "the sun is a copious source of neutrinos with a wide spectrum of energies and these neutrinos have been detected by terrestrial neutrino detectors , although at a rate lower than expected from theoretical calculations .",

    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the relevant astronomy is presented in sec.[ecl ] . in sec.[th ] we give the theory of the passage of the solar neutrinos through the moon and earth , taking into account properly the non - adiabatic transitions occuring at the boundaries of the moon and earth . in sec.[calc ] we present the numerical calculations of the neutrino detection rates during the single and double eclipses and the results .",
    "sec.[disc ] is devoted to discussion .",
    "solar neutrinos are produced within the solar core whose radius is of order @xmath6 of the solar radius and we shall approximate this by a point at the center of the sun .",
    "what is required for our purpose is that the lunar disc must cover this point at the center of the sun and so as far as the neutrino radiation is concerned , the solar eclipse is more like an occultation of a star or a planet by the moon .",
    "astronomers characterize the solar eclipse by the optical coverage @xmath7 which is defined as the ratio of the area of the solar disc covered by the lunar disc to the total area of the solar disc .",
    "we first calculate how @xmath7 varies with time during an eclipse .",
    "there are three parameters which completely characterize the time - dependence of any solar eclipse .",
    "* the first parameter is the ratio , @xmath8 , of the apparent radii ( in radians , say ) of the moon and sun s discs as seen from earth , @xmath9 .",
    "the eclipse is total if @xmath10 and it is annular if @xmath11 . *",
    "the second parameter is the duration of the eclipse , @xmath12 , measured as the length of time between the initial and final instants where the moon s and sun s discs just touch . *",
    "finally , we have the impact parameter , @xmath13 , defined as the apparent distance of closest approach between the center of the sun s disc and the center of the moon s disc , in units of the sun s apparent radius .",
    "given these quantities , the expression for @xmath7 as a function of time @xmath14 during an eclipse is determined by simple geometry as follows .",

    "as many as 32 solar eclipses are listed to occur during the 14 year period 1996 through 2010 .",

    "we make the following comments concerning the neutrino possibilities for the eclipses ( single or double ) that will be visible from kamiokanda , sudbury or gran sasso ( the site of borexino ) between 1997 and 2002 :    march 9 , 1997 : :     this eclipse was a single eclipse at kamiokanda , with an approximate    duration of two and a half hours and a maximum optical coverage of    just over 50% . this eclipse was a double eclipse at the gran ",
    "sasso ,    for much the same duration , also with roughly 50% optical coverage .",
    "february 26 , 1998 : :     for this eclipse only gran sasso saw more than 39% coverage , with    the moon and sun s discs barely touching as seen from sudbury and 23%    coverage seen in japan .",
    "the eclipse was double in gran ",
    "sasso with a    maximum coverage of 60% .",
    "august 11 , 1999 : :     _ this eclipse will provide one of the best opportunities _ , being    seen as a single eclipse with about 80% optical coverage and almost 3    hour duration at gran - sasso . _ it is also visible from sudbury _ , with    70% coverage , for just short of two hours close to the horizon near    sunrise . unfortunately the super  kamiokanda site will get the smallest    coverage , utmost about 30% , for a double eclipse lasting just over an    hour . december 25 , 2000 : :     this eclipse lasts for three hours around noon ( and so is a single    eclipse ) on christmas day as seen from sudbury , but the moon s disc    does not intersect the sun s as seen from the other two sites .",
    "50% is    the maximum coverage presented to sno .",
    "july 31 , 2000 : :     this eclipse is not visible at all from japan , and presents less    than 10% coverage in italy , but is close to our threshold of interest    as seen from sudbury , being a double eclipse seen from there , with    maximum coverage of 32% .",
    "december 14 , 2001 : :     kamiokanda and gran sasso see respectably large coverage this day    ( 70% and 85% , respectively ) , with both seeing a double eclipse whose    duration is about 100 minutes .",
    "by contrast , sudbury sees only a    grazing eclipse with coverage not reaching 10% .",
    "june 10 , 2002 : :     this two - hour - long ( single ) eclipse falls just below threshold  32%    maximum coverage  seen from kamiokanda .",
    "sudbury again sees less than    10% coverage , while no eclipse occurs at all from gran sasso s    perspective .",
    "tables [ table 1 ] through [ table 3 ] list the times , durations , maximum coverage and direction of all these eclipses . plots of the optical coverage @xmath7 and the fractional distance @xmath43 traveled by the neutrino as a function of time @xmath14 for the same eclipses are given in fig.[fig .",
    "a ] to [ fig .",
    "c ]    the lesson to be learned from these tables and figures is that there is , on the average , about one eclipse per year for which the maximum coverage exceeds 39% , and once several detectors become available it will not be uncommon for any of these eclipses to be seen by more than one detector at a time .",
    "we now describe a straightforward way of obtaining the neutrino regeneration effect in the moon .",
    "the moon has a radius of @xmath59 km and has an approximately uniform density of @xmath60gms / cc , except for a core of radius @xmath61 km , where the density jumps to @xmath62 gm / cc@xcite .",
    "the effect of the core can be treated by the method in sec.[secmoonearth ] , but this is required only for @xmath63 which occurs only very rarely , as seen from figs.([fig .",
    "c ] ) . hence we restrict ourselves to a model of moon of constant density .",
    "let a neutrino of flavor @xmath64 be produced at time @xmath65 in the core of the sun .",
    "its state vector is @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the matrix elements of the matter dependent mixing matrix in the core of the sun .",
    "we use greek index @xmath64 to denote the three flavors e , @xmath68,@xmath69 and latin index i to denote the mass eigenstates i = 1,2,3 .",
    "the neutrino propagates in the sun adiabatically upto @xmath70 ( the resonance point ) , makes non - adiabatic transitions at @xmath71 , propagates adiabatically upto @xmath72 ( the edge of the sun ) and propagates as a free particle upto @xmath73 when it enters the moon .",
    "so the state vector at @xmath73 is @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the matter dependent energy eigenvalues in the sun , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates in vacuum and @xmath78 is the probability amplitude for the non - adiabatic transition @xmath79 .",
    "we multiply the right hand side of eq.([psi2 ] ) by @xmath80 ( = 1)where @xmath81 ( i = 1,2,3 ) is the complete set of matter dependent mass eigenstates inside the moon .",
    "the neutrino propagates upto the the other end of the moon at @xmath82 , and the state vector at @xmath82 is @xmath83 we have introduced the probability amplitude @xmath84 for non - adiabatic transitions @xmath85 due to the abrupt change in density when the neutrino enters the moon .",

    "the neutrino leaves the other end of the moon at @xmath90 and propagates upto the surface of earth , which it reaches at @xmath91 .so the state vector at @xmath91 is @xmath92 where @xmath93 we have used the fact that the the probability amplitude for non - adiabatic transitions @xmath94 due to the abrupt change in density when the neutrino leaves the moon is @xmath95 the probability of detecting a neutrino of flavor @xmath96 at @xmath97 is @xmath98 where the summation is over the set of indices @xmath99 averaging over @xmath70 leads to @xmath100 and this results in the desired incoherent mixture of mass eigenstates of neutrinos reaching the surface of the moon at @xmath73 . calling this averaged probability as @xmath101 ( the probability for a neutrino produced in the sun as @xmath102 to be detected as @xmath103 in earth after passing through the moon ) , we can write the result as @xmath104 where @xmath105 where we have replaced @xmath106 by @xmath107 , the distance traveled by the neutrino inside the moon , and @xmath108 by @xmath109 the distance traveled by the neutrino from the moon to earth .",
    "if there is no moon , we put @xmath40 = 0 , so that @xmath110 becomes @xmath111 and so eq.([pabm ] ) reduces to the usual @xcite averaged probability for @xmath112 produced in the sun to be detected as @xmath113 in earth : @xmath114      we start with @xmath115 given by eq.([psi4 ] ) and multiply the right hand side by @xmath116 (= 1 ) where @xmath117 @xmath118 is a complete set of mass eigenstates just below the surface of earth . if the neutrino that enters earth at time @xmath119 propagates adiabatically upto @xmath120 ( non - adiabatic jumps during the propagation will be considered subsequently ) , its state vector at time @xmath121 is @xmath122 where we have introduced the probability amplitude @xmath123 for non adiabatic transitions @xmath124 due to the abrupt change in density when the neutrino enters the earth .",

    "for the double eclipse we present results only for the model of earth with constant density ( @xmath196 gms / cc ) . this can be taken as a rough guide and detailed calculations for the double eclipse are reserved for the future .",

    "the main features of the results are as follows :    * as the distance traveled by the neutrino inside the moon increases one can see an appreciable increase in the enhancement factor @xmath189 .",
    "it increases from less than @xmath203 to about almost @xmath204 when the neutrino travels the whole diameter of the moon in the case of two flavor mixing i.e @xmath199 = @xmath205 . *",
    "large ( @xmath206 ) values of @xmath189 occur for @xmath197 between @xmath207 and @xmath208 and @xmath209 this is true even for nonzero @xmath199 .",
    "* it may be noted from fig.[fig .",
    "3 ] that the maximum enhancement region for @xmath202 is not far away from the present ( 2generation ) best fit parameters of super kamiokanda @xcite(@xmath210 ) , which may be encouraging for the observation of the eclipse effect . *",
    "the effect of a non zero `` 13 '' mixing angle @xmath199 , is to dilute the enhancement factor @xmath189 for all values of distance traveled through the moon.(in fact for @xmath211 , @xmath189 is practically zero and so we have not plotted this case . )",
    "this is because a non zero @xmath199 means @xmath212 oscillations , and matter can not reconvert @xmath2 back to @xmath0 , because the `` 13 '' mixing angle @xmath199 is not affected by matter . *",
    "if large enhancement @xmath189 is seen for values of @xmath213 , it immediately signals a very small value of @xmath199 . on the other hand ,",
    "if no enhancement is seen for small @xmath43 but there is enhancement only for @xmath214 it signals an appreciable value of @xmath199 . * for a double eclipse there are considerable enhancements even for small values of @xmath197 .",
    "there is enhancement throughout the range of @xmath197 from small angles till about @xmath215 .",
    "in fact the regions of largest enhancement ( @xmath216 ) are for @xmath197 between @xmath217 to @xmath207 .",
    "although the region of maximum enhancement factor @xmath190 is centered around @xmath218,sizeable enhancement occurs over a wide range of @xmath198 .",
    "however , the details are likely to change when calculations are done for a more realistic density distribution inside earth . *",
    "if enhancement is not seen , then certain regions of the neutrino parameter space can be excluded.if no enhancement is seen for single eclipse , a panel of @xmath197 between @xmath219 and @xmath220 for @xmath199 = 0 can be ruled out .",
    "if it is not seen for a double eclipse , a larger region can be ruled out .",
    "having calculated the enhancements as a function of the distance traveled , we may now estimate roughly the enhancement in the event rate for an eclipse at a particular site .",
    "for this purpose we choose an eclipse with a rather long duration to evaluate the enhancement .",
    "one such eclipse occurs rather soon at gran sasso on august 11 , 1999 with 84 minutes of duration with nonzero @xmath43 .",
    "a simple estimate based on the enhancements presented in fig.[fig .",
    "3 ] integrated using the time  dependence presented in fig.[fig .",
    "c ] for this eclipse , leads one to conclude that the total neutrino count during this 84 minutes could be enhanced by a factor of 1.5 for @xmath202 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 and it is less for other values of the neutrino parameters .",
    "our calculations thus indicate that the observation of the eclipse effect is _ not _ possible at the present detectors as the counting rates currently are no more than about one per hour .",
    "however , the calculated enhancements are not too small to be discarded completely .",
    "we envisage that the eclipse effect can become detectable in the near future in two or three ways .",
    "experimental neutrino physics will continue to cross new frontiers with innovative techniques leading to counting rates that are larger by an order of magnitude .",
    "one such proposal that has been already made is the borex detector@xcite where the counting rate can be as large as 40 per hour .",
    "with such a detector , our calculations of enhancement factors show that the eclipse effect would be clearly observable .",
    "another possibility is the accumulation of data during a large number of eclipses to obtain a statistically significant sample , which may enable one to observe an enhancement or to rule out a given parameter space .",
    "yet another interesting possibility is to exploit the fact that some eclipses occur simultaneously at two sites .",
    "correlation between the data collected at the two sites can enhance the statistical significance of scanty data .",
    "it must be remembered that the counting rates at the present  day detectors such as super - kamiokanda could hardly have been anticipated 20 years back .",
    "one of the strengths of neutrino physics is that even when counting rates have been small the accumulated effect has stood the test of time over a 30 year period .",
    "the eclipse effect is perhaps an effect which may be observable only in a prolonged study and ours is only an effort to initiate such a study .",
    "it is also pertinent to remark here that although the original proposal to observe the shadow of the moon@xcite in high - energy cosmic rays was made in @xmath223@xcite , it took more than 30 years to observe it@xcite .",
    "we have studied the effect on the solar neutrinos of their passage through the moon as well as the moon together with earth . although the numerical results presented in the paper cover only a representative sample of the set of various parameters , our analytical expressions can be used for more extensive calculations depending on the requirement .",
    "also one can go beyond the hierarchy : @xmath224 .      * together with the day - night effect , the eclipse effects provide us with the tools for studying solar neutrinos , in a way independent of the uncertainties of the solar models . *",
    "if the neutrino mass differences are really very small ( @xmath225 ) there is no way of pinning down the neutrino parameters other than using the astronomical objects such as the moon or earth for the `` long - base - line experiments '' .",
    "* it is important to stress that even the demonstrated absence of any eclipse effect would provide us with definitive information on neutrino physics . *",
    "accumulation of data over many eclipses may be needed for good statistics . in any future planning of detector sites",
    ", this may be kept in mind . *",
    "it appears that nature has chosen the neutrino parameters in such a way that the sun affects the propagation of solar neutrinos .",
