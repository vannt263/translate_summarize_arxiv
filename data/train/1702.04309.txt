    "the question how to reconcile the foundations of quantum theory with the dynamical space - time structure of general relativity is often reduced to problems arising at the planck scale , e.g. in the physics of black holes or the early universe . nonetheless , the status of the description of both gravity and quantum matter in a common framework is far from clear also at low energies : certainly from the point of view of experimental observations , but also from a theoretical perspective .",
    "an illustrative example is the familiar double - slit experiment , if conducted with a massive particle .",
    "assume a high sensitivity gravitational probe ( a test mass attached to a sophisticated force metre ) could be placed behind the slit , sensing the gravitational field of the spatial superposition state prepared by the slit .",
    "what is the gravitational field it would observe ?",
    "in analogy to electrodynamics one is tempted to think that the answer is obvious : the gravitational field should be in a superposition state itself , which is entangled with the particle state .",
    "however , the analogy between gravity and electrodynamics must eventually fail ; at the latest when it comes to the question of renormalisability .",
    "one may , therefore , ask whether this analogy is still appropriate for the case of macroscopic non - classical states at low energy . in general relativity ,",
    "on the other hand , the gravitational field is an expression of the space - time structure .",
    "matter acts as a source , determining the curvature of space time . in the presence of quantised matter fields",
    ", one would ask : how does this quantum matter in a non - localised state source the gravitational field ?    keeping the classical space - time structure of general relativity , and treating quantum fields  which are then living on this curved space - time  as a curvature source , gives rise to the idea of ( fundamentally ) semi - classical gravity . the seemingly most straightforward way to incorporate quantum matter as a source into einstein s equations is to replace the classical stress - energy tensor by the expectation value of the corresponding quantum operator : @xmath0 these are the semi - classical einstein equations which have first been proposed in this context by mller  @xcite and rosenfeld  @xcite .",
    "arguments have been invoked attempting to rule out this type of coupling between quantum matter and gravity solely on theoretical grounds .",
    "it has been pointed out that eq .",
    "is incompatible with both an instantaneous wave - function collapse and a no - collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , this leaves open the possibility of a dynamical collapse in the spirit of collapse models  @xcite .",
    "more general assertions against any type of semi - classical coupling  @xcite were found inconclusive  @xcite .",
    "it seems that rosenfeld was right when emphasising the necessity of experimental tests whether or not the gravitational field should be quantised : _",
    "`` there is no denying that , considering the universality of the quantum of action , it is very tempting to regard any classical theory as a limiting case to some quantal theory . in the absence of empirical evidence , however , this temptation should be resisted . the case for quantizing gravitation , in particular ,",

    "starting with the _ classical _ einstein equations for a _ classical _ klein - gordon ( or dirac ) field , one can show that the gravitational self - coupling is promoted to the schrdinger equation ( as a differential equation for the evolution of a classical field ) obtained in the nonrelativistic ( @xmath1 ) limit  @xcite , where it yields the nonlinear one - particle sn equation : @xmath2    for a _",

    "for a wider wave - function , the self - gravitational effect only becomes less significant .",

    "on the other hand , the required set - up is closer to existing ones , such as cooled mirrors ( e.g. ligo or lisa pathfinder ) .",
    "the fact that all of these systems are based on silicon rather than osmium , however , requires another two orders of magnitude better resolution compared to the same system based on osmium ( cf . tab .",

    "from the above discussion we conclude that , although a realisation is still challenging , the sn equation seems testable with existing technology in the nearer future .",
    "what would we learn from such a test ?    obviously , if the predicted deviations from linear quantum mechanics would be observed , this would result in a complete paradigm shift of our view on both gravity and the foundations of quantum mechanics . if , on the other hand , standard quantum mechanics is confirmed and the sn equation ruled out by experiments ( likely the outcome expected by a large majority of physicists ) this would rule out the semi - classical einstein equations   as a fundamental model .",
    "it would , however , not be conclusive evidence for the quantisation of gravity , since other types of coupling of quantum matter to a classical space - time could be possible , which do not yield the sn equation as a nonrelativistic limit .",
    "in fact , with stochastic gravity  @xcite there is an example for such a model .",
    "as the sn equation was first discussed by disi  @xcite and penrose  @xcite , it is often considered in context of the gravitational collapse model named after these two  @xcite . although not directly related to it",
    ", one can discuss whether the sn equation could play a role in the collapse of the wave - function .",
    "on the one hand , the classicality of the gravitational force provides exactly the non - unitary ingredient needed for an objective collapse . on the other hand",
    ", the sn alone does not explain the emergence of classicality , since the sn `` collapse '' is completely deterministic .",
    "it does not recover the born probability rule  @xcite .",
    "probably the biggest concern against a fundamental validity of the sn equation is that measurements in the usual instantaneous collapse prescription allow for faster - than - light signalling when combined with a nonlinear dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it might be that a consistent description which makes use of semi - classical gravity as an explanation of the wave - function collapse can circumvent this problem .",
