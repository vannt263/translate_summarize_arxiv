    "the need for accurate theoretical helium emission predictions is present in many aspects of astronomy and cosmology .",
    "these include estimates of the primordial helium abundance , calculations of the cosmological recombination history , and , most recently , estimates of the time variation of the higgs vacuum expectation value ( ganer , lesch , & arenhvel 2008 )",
    ". however , these works may involve underestimates of the uncertainties in he  i emissivities .",
    "standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) yields are generally a function of a single parameter , the primordial baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath1 . an important test of sbbn is that , for a single value of this parameter , the predicted light nuclei abundances agree with the abundances deduced from observations .",
    "this is usually expressed via a concordance diagram ( see kirkman et al .",
    "cmb observations have tightly constrained @xmath1 ( spergel et al .",
    "however , the primordial he abundance , @xmath0 , deduced from observations sometimes disagrees with the sbbn yield .",
    "this is troubling because he is the most abundant of these nuclei .",
    "this is an area of active research ( fukugita & kawasaki 2006 ; peimbert , luridiana , & peimbert 2007 ; izotov , thuan , & stasiska 2007 , hereafter fk06 , plp07 , and its07 , respectively ) .",
    "the usual method for deducing @xmath0 is to construct a relation between metallicity ( typically taken as the oxygen and/or nitrogen abundances ) and the helium abundance in selected extragalactic objects .",
    "the @xmath2 relation is then extrapolated to zero metallicity ( at which point all nuclei abundances should be equal to their primordial values ) .",
    "for a recent review of the subject , see steigman ( 2007 ) .",
    "many authors have discussed the errors involved in the @xmath2 relation analyses ( skillman et al .",
    "1998 ; peimbert et al .",
    "2003 ; porter et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the study of the cosmological recombination spectrum is also currently an area of active research ( kholupenko , ivanchik , & varshalovich 2007 ; chluba & sunyaev 2008 ; wong , moss , & scott 2008 ) .",
    "the majority of effects considered in recent years modify the electron fraction by @xmath3 ( see switzer & hirata 2008 ) .",
    "in this letter we seek to address the errors in theoretical he  i emissivities .",
    "we have previously calculated he  i emissivities with two different codes ( bauman et al .",
    "2005 ; porter et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ) . in the low - density limit bauman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) compares the results of these two calculations .",
    "we note that the differences listed there are not meant to be taken as errors . here",
    "we analyze available information and attempt to quantify the accuracy of all atomic data involved in our model atom ( porter et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we then quantify the uncertainties in emissivities via two methods : 1 ) a rigorous propagation of error in the low - density limit ; and 2 ) random perturbations in a monte - carlo analysis .",
    "we consider three sets of conditions typical of galactic h  ii regions , extragalactic h  ii regions , and the epoch of cosmological recombination .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that , while our analysis involves only statistical errors , the errors will yield systematic effects in primordial helium calculations .",
    "the most recent calculations of @xmath0 ( plp07 , its07 ) claim uncertainties @xmath4 , including estimates of the atomic data uncertainties .",
    "we demonstrate that atomic data uncertainties alone introduce a systematic error of similar size .",
    "the physical processes discussed here are largely described in osterbrock & ferland ( 2006 ) .",
    "we group the relevant atomic data by physical process and present them in order of generally increasing uncertainty as follows : bound - bound radiative transitions , free - bound radiative transitions , and collisions .",
    "additional sources of uncertainty are also considered in section  [ other_uncertainties ] below .",
    "level energies are by far the most accurate data involved , and we neglect these uncertainties entirely .    because some atomic data uncertainties will have a nearly linear effect on corresponding emissivity uncertainties , it is critically important what uncertainties we assign to these data . in an attempt to mitigate this ,",
    "we consider both pessimistic and optimistic cases , which are meant to respectively represent the minimum and maximum uncertainty in each datum . in all cases",
    "we allow only one significant figure in our uncertainties , with optimistic cases rounded down and pessimistic cases rounded up .        in figure  [ fig : tweak ] we investigate the effects of the present statistical analyses on @xmath0 estimates .",
    "each line represents a single full set of random perturbations ( corresponding to a particular seeding of the rng ) . for each set",
    "we calculate @xmath5 for the range of temperatures shown on the x - axis . to first order",
    "all curves are linear offsets of the unperturbed line .",
    "this implies that statistical errors in he  i emissivities would affect an ensemble of he abundances all in the same sense and to roughly the same degree , yielding a systematic offset in any @xmath2 relation .",
    "figure  [ fig : concordance ] plots the sbbn helium yields and errors ( solid and dashed lines , respectively , burles et al . 2001 ) as a function of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the blue boxes are the one standard - deviation results of a few recent @xmath0 estimates .",
    "the higher and lower its07 boxes are using the porter et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and benjamin , skillman , & smits ( 1999 ) emissivities , respectively .",
    "the vertical yellow bar depicts the @xmath6 ( and associated error ) derived from 3-year wmap observations ( spergel et al .",
    "the red and green bars have heights equal to 2@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , where @xmath8 are present results for optimistic and pessimistic extragalactic @xmath10 emissivities , respectively",
    ". the green bar could be reduced with a full set of high quality recombination coefficients",
    ". it could be quite difficult to convincingly narrow the optimistic results represented by the red bar , thus prohibiting a @xmath2-based derivation of @xmath1 more accurate than those obtained by wmap .",
    "plp07 include a systematic error in @xmath0 due to uncertainties in he  i emissivities .",
    "their value of @xmath11 and their @xmath0 error are consistent with the present uncertainties in extragalactic @xmath5 .",
    "the fk06 error in @xmath0 is also consistent with our results .",
    "both the plp07 and fk06 results are consistent with sbbn / wmap .",
    "the its07 results are inconsistent or marginally consistent with sbbn / wmap , and their @xmath0 errors are marginally consistent with our analysis .",
    "correlated errors in pairs of he  i emissivitites could be important .",
    "we checked ratios of @xmath134471 , 5876 , and 6678 , in the optimistic extragalactic calculations and found little correlation ; the line - ratio errors are roughly the quadrature sum of the individual line errors .    finally , we consider the cosmological case . in figure",
    "[ fig : saha ] , the standard deviation in the electron fraction @xmath14 is plotted against redshift . the pessimistic errors indicated by the green line reach @xmath15 .",
    "the optimistic errors illustrated by the red line are roughly a factor of 3 smaller .",
    "both are comparable to many of the effects considered by switzer & hirata ( 2008 ) .",
    "a fuller _ non_-time - steady analysis will be considered elsewhere ( porter et al . , in preparation ) ."
