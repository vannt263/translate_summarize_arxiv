    "the skyrme model was originally proposed by tony skyrme in 1961 @xcite .",
    "it is a theory of nuclear matter in which the fundamental building blocks are pion fields .",
    "it was later shown @xcite that it can be regarded as a low - energy approximation to qcd , which becomes more accurate in the large @xmath0-limit , where @xmath0 is the number of quark colours .",
    "the ( topologically non - trivial ) solutions of this theory are called skyrmions .",
    "there is a special way of arranging them in order to obtain the smallest known value of the energy per baryon number seen so far @xcite , known as the skyrme crystal .",
    "this is an infinite , triply - periodic , arrangement of half - skyrmions @xcite . in order to study skyrme crystals ,",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions , with period @xmath1 , on the skyrme field in all three directions .",
    "the skyrmions are therefore defined on a 3-torus @xmath2 .",
    "skyrme crystals were originally proposed by klebanov @xcite as a model for dense nuclear matter , such as that found in neutron stars . at the time , the behaviour of two well - separated skyrmions was already known @xcite  an important feature being that these are maximally - attracted when one is rotated with respect to the other by @xmath3 about a line perpendicular to the line connecting them .",
    "klebanov believed that an interesting extension of this idea would be to have an array of skyrmions , where any skyrmion would be attracted by its nearest neighbours .",
    "a graceful way of achieving this , klebanov showed , would be to arrange the skyrmions in a simple - cubic lattice with appropriate rotations applied to all the nearest neighbours of a chosen skyrmion .",
    "moreover , if the skyrme fields are to have the correct periodicity in all three directions , they must have symmetry elements that combine both spatial transformations as well as isospin transformations acting on the individual fields ( more on this later in the introduction ) .",
    "klebanov also showed that there is a minimum in the energy per baryon number of the lattice for a certain value of the period @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , there is a preferred size of the fundamental cell .",
    "later , goldhaber and manton showed @xcite that there is a phase transition from a low - density simple - cubic lattice of skyrmions to a high - density body - centred lattice of half - skyrmions .",
    "however , it has since been shown by kugler and shtrikman @xcite and by castillejo et al .",
    "@xcite that the lowest energy per baryon configuration is that of a ( high - density ) half - skyrmion phase corresponding to an initial ( low - density ) face - centred cubic ( fcc ) array of skyrmions .",
    "an fcc array is one in which skyrmions with standard orientation are placed on the vertices of a cube and more skyrmions are placed on the face centres , but this time rotated by @xmath3 about an axis perpendicular to the face .",
    "such a configuration produces 12 nearest neighbours ( to a particular skyrmion ) , which are all in the attractive channel .",
    "if the origin is fixed at the centre of one of the unrotated skyrmions and the skyrme fields are given by @xmath4 , then the fcc configuration would have spatial and isospin symmetries , as was alluded to above .",
    "the generators for these symmetries are listed in table 1 @xcite :    [ table : gensymmetries ]    the transformations listed here are @xmath5 : a reflection in the @xmath6axis , @xmath7 : a `` negative '' three - fold rotation about the diagonal that goes from the origin to the opposite corner of the cube ( defined as `` @xmath8 '' ) , @xmath9 : a `` negative '' four - fold rotation about the @xmath6axis , and @xmath10 : a positive @xmath11translation in both the @xmath6axis and the @xmath12axis .",
    "note that these are a subset of the possible transformations that can be carried out on an fcc lattice .",
    "for example , one can also have a `` positive '' three - fold rotation along the same diagonal , @xmath13 , given by the transformation : @xmath14 .",
    "another possible transformation could also be a `` positive '' four - fold rotation about the @xmath15axis , @xmath16 : @xmath17 .",
    "there is an additional symmetry unique to the high - density phase of half - skyrmions .",
    "its generator is given by :    [ table : gensymmetries ]    note that this transformation involves a chiral @xmath18 , rather than just isospin @xmath19 rotations displayed in table 1 above and it can replace the @xmath10 transformation since that can be achieved through successive applications of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    in this letter , we will see that the field behaves in an interesting way as one changes the period of the crystal in different ways , for different directions .",
    "for example , if we start with the skyrme crystal and then increase the period along all three space dimensions in the same way , one gets the familiar picture of the cubically - symmetric charge @xmath22 skyrmion . we also show that the energy density of the @xmath22 skyrmion displays certain similarities previously seen in the context of skyrme chains , provided we have large @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 are the periods in the @xmath6 and @xmath12directions ) and small @xmath25 values .",
    "skyrme chains are solutions of the skyrme model , which are periodic in one space dimension .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that soliton chains generally have constituents in the form of vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "these emerge when the period is small compared to the natural soliton size - a feature that we verify when the period in the z - direction is small compared to the other two space dimensions .",
    "when the period increases , the constituents tend to clump together , a feature that is also verified here .    a double skyrme sheet @xcite , is also seen to emerge at small @xmath23 and large ( and effectively infinite ) @xmath25 values .",
    "it takes the form of a square lattice , an object analogous to the hexagonal `` skyrme domain wall '' solution @xcite .",
    "however , our system is periodic in all three directions , which means that the vacuum value on both sides of the skyrme sheets ( @xmath26 in the z - direction ) is unique .",
    "finally , we describe what happens as one increases the period simultaneously in all three directions , starting with the skyrme crystal , and show that there is a rapid transition between the skyrme crystal and the @xmath22 skyrmion with cubic symmetry .",
    "we show evidence which suggests that this is a second - order phase transition with an order parameter given by the period @xmath27 of the configuration ( where @xmath28 ) .",
    "the static energy density of the skyrme model is given by :    @xmath29[l_i , l_j])\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the spatial coordinates , and the field @xmath32 is an su(2)-valued scalar field .",
    "the pions are grouped into this scalar field as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a triplet of pion fields , @xmath35 is the triplet of pauli matrices , and @xmath36 is an additional scalar field determined through the constraint : @xmath37 .    the energy @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39    the scalar field @xmath40 is a map from @xmath41 , compactified at infinity , to @xmath42 , the group manifold of su(2 ) .",
    "skyrme identified the degree of this map , a topological invariant , with the baryon number , which is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the topological charge density .",
    "the energy ( [ eq : sken ] ) satisfies the faddeev - bogomolny lower bound @xcite @xmath45 .    an analytic approximation for the fields of the skyrme crystal",
    "was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the @xmath18 chiral symmetry as well as the @xmath19 isospin symmetries .",
    "the fields are expressed as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it is a good approximation to the actual minimal - energy solution .      in what follows ,",
    "we take periodic boundary conditions in all three space directions - the periods will be specified in the relevant sections .",
    "the lattice spacings in the @xmath49 directions are given by @xmath50 and the number of lattice points are given by @xmath51 , yielding side - lengths @xmath52 .",
    "we use a first - order finite - difference scheme and implement a full 3-dimensional numerical minimization of the energy using the conjugate gradient method ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) .",
    "note that there is a numerical error associated with the finite lattice spacing .",
    "the way we approximate the errors in the energy , for a given configuration , is by comparing its topological charge ( using numerical methods ) with the `` true '' value of its charge .",
    "we assume the same errors in energy and charge since similar finite - difference methods are employed in calculating each of these values .",
    "we have noticed that higher differences in the lattice spacing in each space direction yield higher errors .    the initial condition that we start with for minimization is the approximate skyrme crystal of eight half - skyrmions , namely ( [ eq : appsolcrystal1 ] ) and ( [ eq : appsolcrystal2 ] ) . after being minimized , the period in each direction for this initial configuration",
    "is then changed in a certain way ( described in the relevant section ) and then re - minimized .",
    "the first case is the one for which the period in all three directions is large for the initial configuration and then the @xmath23 periods are reduced gradually .",
    "the initial period is given by @xmath53 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : lxyreduce ] ) and then reduce @xmath24 by 1 each time .",
    "we start by increasing the periods @xmath28 for the minimized skyrme crystal from @xmath54 to @xmath55 by increasing the value of @xmath56 , for a certain value of @xmath57 , and thus producing fig.1(a ) .",
    "afterwards , @xmath56 is kept constant and @xmath27 is reduced by @xmath8 each time .",
    "one can see that the translation symmetries , @xmath58 , ( where @xmath59 and in either direction @xmath60 ) of the high - density skyrme crystal are broken in fig.1(a ) , which is the @xmath22 skyrmion , whereas all reflection symmetries , @xmath61 , three - fold rotations @xmath62 , and four - fold rotations @xmath63 remain unbroken  characteristic of cubic symmetry . in fig .",
    "1(b)-(f ) , @xmath64 and @xmath65 symmetries are regained ( possibly due to the fact that we are `` squeezing '' the configuration in these directions ) , whereas @xmath66 remains broken only for fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "1(c ) , due to the fact that these figures are not extended throughout the whole period in the @xmath67direction .",
    "the reflection symmetries @xmath61 are unbroken and the three - fold rotations @xmath62 are broken in fig .",
    "1(b)-(f ) .",
    "the four - fold rotations @xmath68 remain unbroken throughout , whereas @xmath69 are broken in fig .",
    "1(b)-(f ) .",
    "note that a double skyrme sheet configuration @xcite emerges in fig .",
    "the separation between the sheets , which is calculated by measuring the distance between the energy density peaks as a function of @xmath70 , remains constant as @xmath23 is reduced further and @xmath25 is kept constant at @xmath71 .",
    "however , the energy decreases from a value of @xmath72 at @xmath53 down to a minimum of @xmath73 at @xmath74 and , finally , increases to @xmath75 at @xmath76 .    , where @xmath77 is the maximum value of the energy density ( all isosurfaces in subsequent figures have the same surface value ) .",
    "the first isosurface corresponds to the @xmath22 skyrmion for the periods @xmath53 .",
    "each successive picture has @xmath23 reduced by 1 and @xmath25 is kept constant at 7.05.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the preferred configuration for this skyrme sheet is to have @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , if we fix @xmath78 and vary @xmath79 away from this value in either direction , we notice that the energy increases .",
    "we now start with a large @xmath25 period , which will be reduced , and keep @xmath80 constant .",
    "the starting point is @xmath81 , which is then reduced by @xmath8 each time . in this section , @xmath82",
    "are kept constant , producing different @xmath83 values each time @xmath25 is changed .    the initial condition ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : appsolcrystal1 ] ) and ( [ eq : appsolcrystal2 ] ) ) is first minimized for the periods @xmath80 and @xmath81 , producing the double skyrme sheet configuration seen in fig .",
    "the only broken symmetries associated with this configuration , which is seen to persist in fig .",
    "2(b ) and fig .",
    "2(c ) , are @xmath69 and @xmath62 .",
    "these are regained in fig .",
    "2(d ) , which is a ( non - minimal ) skyrme crystal configuration . as the @xmath25 period",
    "is decreased further , we notice the appearance of vortex - like structures , which are periodic in the @xmath67direction ( fig .",
    "2(e ) and fig .",
    "the symmetries associated with these configurations are the same as those in figs .",
    "2(a)-(c ) and , in fact , the translation symmetry in the @xmath67direction , @xmath66 , becomes continuous for fig .",
    "2(f ) , since there is no longer any noticeable @xmath67dependence . this ties into the subject of skyrme chains , which has been explored in @xcite .",
    "the energy of the isosurfaces decreases from a value of @xmath84 at @xmath81 , down to a minimum of @xmath85 at @xmath86 ( where the isosurfaces are still in the form of a double square wall ) , then back up to @xmath87 at @xmath88 .",
    "double skyrme sheet configuration , where @xmath80 remains fixed and where @xmath81 is reduced by 1 in each successive picture , transforming the double skyrme sheet into a ( non - minimal ) skyrme crystal and thereafter into a parallel 4-vortex structure.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      in this section , we show how one can transform a double skyrme sheet configuration into the 4-vortex configuration discussed in the previous section , by changing both @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( rather than just @xmath25 ) , and going through an intermediate , minimal , skyrme crystal state , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lxyexpandlzreduce ] .",
    "the initial period is @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the former is then increased by 1 and the latter decreased by 3 , two consecutive times , producing figs .",
    "3(b)-(c ) .",
    "the changes in the periods are then swapped , increasing @xmath23 by 3 and decreasing @xmath25 by 1 , for two consecutive times , producing figs .",
    "3(d)-(e ) .",
    "here , @xmath82 are kept constant , producing different @xmath91 and @xmath83 values , each time the periods are changed .",
    "we start by minimizing the approximate skyrme crystal ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : appsolcrystal1 ] ) and ( [ eq : appsolcrystal2 ] ) ) for the periods @xmath89 and @xmath90 , producing the double skyrme sheets discussed in the previous sections ( with the same symmetries ) in fig",
    "as the periods are changed , as described above , the skyrme sheets still persist in fig .",
    "3(b ) , and change into the ( minimal - energy ) skyrme crystal in fig .",
    "3(c ) ( with all its associated symmetries as described in the introduction ) . as @xmath23 increase and",
    "@xmath25 decreases further , the skyrme crystal changes into a 4-vortex structure , figs .",
    "3(d)-(e ) , which have less of a @xmath67dependence than the ones in figs .",
    "2(e)-(f ) , respectively .    the skyrme crystal has the minimum energy , with @xmath92 , followed by the square 2-walls at @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 . the final picture , the 4-vortex configuration with the smallest @xmath96value , has the highest energy , with @xmath97 , which follows from the fact that skyrme chains `` prefer '' to be closer together in the @xmath98directions @xcite .",
    "thus far , we have changed the periods in the three space directions in different ways - by decreasing @xmath23 ( or keeping it constant ) and keeping @xmath25 constant ( or decreasing it ) or changing all three periods at different rates at the same time .",
    "we now turn to the case where we increase ( or decrease ) all three periods simultaneously at the same rate .",
    "it turns out that an interesting feature of the @xmath22 system is uncovered when one starts from the minimal - energy skyrme crystal configuration at @xmath54 and then increases the periods simultaneously until the individual half - skyrmions coalesce .",
    "these half - skyrmions clump in a sudden fashion when one perturbs the system in a certain way .",
    "we perturbed it by removing one lattice site through the middle of the configuration in all three directions , thereby `` squeezing '' the half - skyrmions together in all directions .",
    "therefore , in order to see them coalescing , one needs to increase the periods very gradually .",
    "this appears to happen in the range @xmath99 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lxyzexpand ] , where the first picture has periods @xmath54 and the following three correspond to the range just mentioned .. however , the general feature that the half - skyrmions coalesce rapidly remains the same .",
    "] compare this with fig .",
    "[ fig : cube ] , where the periods are increased in larger steps .",
    "the sudden merging of the half - skyrmions can be visualized in a different fashion by taking the maximum value of the difference in the energy densities of the fields @xmath100 $ ] under a certain symmetry transformation , in this case a translation of @xmath101 in the @xmath102direction , which is half the size of the fundamental cell , and dividing by the maximum value of the energy density , i.e. @xmath103-\\mathcal{e}[\\phi_{\\beta}(x^{j ' } ) ] ) _ { \\mathrm{max}}/\\mathcal{e}_{\\mathrm{max}}$ ] , where @xmath104 .",
    "we then plot this as a function of the period @xmath27 - the reason we do this is that , as soon as the half - skyrmions start to coalesce , they will no longer be @xmath105periodic . for the skyrme crystal ,",
    "this difference is seen to be essentially zero and it then starts to increase as the half - skyrmions begin to coalesce as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymmetries ]    this jump in the asymmetries of the crystal is analogous to a phase transition in thermodynamics .",
    "there is a sudden transition from a crystalline phase , which has more symmetries , such as chiral @xmath18 symmetries for the skyrme crystal , to a phase with less symmetries , such as @xmath19 isospin symmetries for the @xmath22 cubic - shaped skyrmion .",
    "we expect the transition to become more pronounced as the number of bins increases  as can be seen in fig . 6 , when @xmath56 is increased from 32 to 36 , which starts to resemble a step function .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath106 values are independent of which @xmath27 value one starts with , which hints to a lack of hysteresis in the system .",
    "extending the analogy with phase transitions , this lack of hysteresis strongly suggests a second - order phase transition ( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) , with no latent heat , and with the period @xmath27 as the order parameter .",
    "we have seen that changing the periods of the skyrme crystal , away from the values which minimize its energy , has allowed us to find new configurations  such as the double square lattice of `` skyrme sheets ''  as well as unearthing unforeseen connections with skyrme chains .",
    "the skyrme sheets are produced when the period @xmath23 is small compared with @xmath25 .",
    "our results @xcite have shown that these are more energetically favourable than the double hexagonal case , which makes them a prime candidate for use as building blocks for large - charge configurations .",
    "if one then goes to the other limit of large @xmath23 and small @xmath25 one gets a series of four vortex - like charge @xmath107 objects , which is related to the subject of skyrme chains @xcite .",
    "as the periods are changed and we go through these different configurations , we have seen that these generally merge and separate in the directions in which one is changing the period , for example , the merging of the half - skyrmions in the @xmath70 direction as the period is decreased along this direction .",
    "we have also noticed that the phase transition from the skyrme crystal to a charge @xmath22 skyrmion is likely to be second - order , due to the lack of hysteresis in the system , and with an order parameter given by the period @xmath27 .",
    "note that the deformations considered here have all been along one or more of the edges of the skyrme crystal , keeping it rectangular",
    ". an interesting extension , which we plan to investigate , would be to see if any new structures emerge when one applies more general affine transformations , such as a stretch along a diagonal of the crystal",
