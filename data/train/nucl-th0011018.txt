    "for a strong coupling theory it is important to go beyond the perturbation calculation .",
    "the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equation provides one of the effective means to achieve such a goal . as is wellknown , the requirement of self - consistency can make the infinite series of feynman diagrams contained in the solution to the equation nested , with each nest again containing the same infinite series of nested diagrams .",
    "however , the equation will then become nonlinear and not easy to solve .",
    "there is always the question what new effects on the solution may be produced by such a nesting and whether the latter is always important .",
    "in the zero - density case brown , puff and wilets [ 1 ] as well as bielajew and serot [ 2 ] have solved the ds equation for the renormalized baryon propagators self - consistently according to the dressed hartree - fock ( hf ) scheme . as is wellknown ,",
    "the @xmath0 model has achieved considerable success in the description of many bulk and single particle properties of nuclei [ 3 ] .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to use it as a tool to study the effect of self - consistency in some detail . for simplicity we shall only consider the case of zero - density , where the tadpole self - energies need",
    "not be taken into account .",
    "the different self - consistent ( dressed ) hf schemes are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . by  dressed ",
    "it is meant that in the baryon and meson self - energies the hadron propagators are not all bare .",
    "if one requires self - consistency in the baryon propagators , i.e. @xmath6 in fig . 1a ,",
    "while sets @xmath7 and @xmath8 , it is referred to as scheme bp . in this case the ds equation represented by fig .",
    "1a is already closed .",
    "since @xmath6 , it is easily seen by iteration that the self - energy is now nested and the nesting repeats again and again .",
    "clearly one may also require self - consistency in all the hadron propagators contained in the self - energies .",
    "this implies that one should have @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 and it will be referred to as the fully self - consistent ( fsc ) scheme . in order to solve for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 we must now consider a coupled set of ds equations , since the propagators are mutually correlated as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "such a set of equations has been solved recently by bracco , eiras , krein and wilets ( bekw ) [ 4 ] for a @xmath14 model .",
    "their calculation shows that the effect of self - consistency on the spectral properties of the hadron propagators is not significant and it also can not make the ghost poles disappear .",
    "following previous works by milana [ 5 ] , allendes and serot [ 6 ] and krein , nielsen , puff and wilets [ 7 ] , bekw further found that the ghost poles in all the hadron propagators considered in the model can be eliminated if vertex corrections are properly taken into account .",
    "recently , by means of a simple model we have shown [ 8 ] that the self - consistency in scheme bp diminishes the continuum part of the spectral representation for the baryon propagator and for the calculation of the latter , there is a simpler scheme which is a good approximation to scheme bp .",
    "we would like to ascertain whether the above results hold more generally .",
    "we shall study the coupled set of ds equations according to the fsc scheme .",
    "the effects of self - consistency will be investigated in some detail .",
    "it is found that they affect the baryon spectral function noticeably , in case only the @xmath1 meson is considered .",
    "however , there is almost no difference between the results obtained from scheme bp and fsc .",
    "it is interesting to find that the additional contribution of @xmath3 mesons makes the above effect insignificant .",
    "this indicates that there is a cancellation between the contributions from the @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons . in both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 cases",
    "the effects of self - consistency on meson spectral functions are perceptible , but they can be taken account of without a self - consistent calculation .",
    "our calculation shows that to include the meson propagators in the self - consistent requirement is unnecessary and one can stop at an early step of an iteration procedure to obtain a good approximation to the fsc scheme for the calculation of all the hadron propagators in the model . in analogy to ref .",
    "[ 4 ] , we have also obtained that neither scheme bp nor scheme fsc can eliminate the ghost poles . since the question of ghost poles is of vital theoretical importance , following refs .",
    "[ 4 , 6 , 7 , 9 ] , we have further calculated the contributions of vertex corrections and studied their consequences .",

    "we shall consider the coupled set of ds equations for the renormalized hadron propagators in the @xmath0 model and its reduction .",

    "8 differs from fig .",
    "3 so greatly . a comparison between figs .",
    "3 and 8 suggests that there exists a cancellation between the effects on self - consistency due to the @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "this is obviously related to the @xmath1-baryon and @xmath3-baryon interactions and thus also to the different characteristic features contributed to the baryon - baryon interaction by the @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons individually .",
    "it seems that these features are not only of importance to the nuclear binding and saturation , but also to the formation of baryonic excited states ( see below ) .",
    "we expect the above relation between the cancellation and the different characteristics of meson - baryon interactions may hold generally , though the details of its regularity will depend on the participating meson fields and there may even be enhancement if their characteristics are of the same kind ( which is actually defined by the enhancement ) . if the regularity of cancellation can be extended to the case of finite density , it will be very useful , because the analysis and the renormalized calculation will be greatly simplified , when the effect of self - consistency is negligible .",
    "however , this is still a problem to be studied . to illustrate how the @xmath3 meson affects the disappearance of the effect of self - consistency we have drawn a set of @xmath209 and @xmath210 calculated for an intermediate @xmath215 in fig .",
    "we note that owing to the presence of @xmath3 mesons the maximum of each baryon spectral function becomes sharper and more distinct .",
    "since @xmath216 relates directly to the probability of occurrence of an excited baryon state , it indicates that the contribution of @xmath3 mesons enhances the possibility of forming a resonant baryon state , though we do not expect that the @xmath0 model may explain the experimentally observed baryon spectrum . from fig .",
    "it looks that a discernible effect of self - consistency exists for mesons .",

    "this suggests that for the calculation of hadron propagators the two methods can yield closely approximated results .",
    "we have found that all the ghost poles are eliminated .",
    "the reason seems intimately related with the change of the asymptotic behavior caused by the vertex correction . for the baryon self - energy",

    "17 , because if @xmath105 becomes large , @xmath283 will be negligible compared with @xmath105 .",
    "it is interesting to note that there will be no ghost poles if @xmath279 bends the straight line upward or the curve @xmath284 turns upward before it intersects the @xmath105-axis .",
    "under the self - consistent hf approximation we have solved the coupled set of ds equations for the renormalized hadron propagators in the @xmath0 model . since",
    "this set can be solved rigorously , it provides a convenient means for the study of the effects of self - consistency .",
    "our calculation shows that in the case of zero - density scheme pep gives a quite good approximation to the fsc scheme and there is no need to require self - consistency in the meson propagators . in the @xmath0 case",
    "the self - consistency almost has no effect on the baryon propagator , since there is a cancellation between the effects caused by the two kinds of mesons , whereas for the @xmath1 case a fsc calculation is also unnecessary , because the iteration procedure converges quickly if an appropriate initial input is chosen .",
    "3 shows that the self - consistency diminishes the continuum part of the baryon spectral representation predicted by scheme p. from tab .",
    "2 one observes that this part is by no means always unimportant . however , there is generally no need to consider scheme bp , since if scheme p does not yield a good enough result , one may go one step further to use scheme pep . for the study of nuclear matter and nuclear structure one",
    "has to take the case of non - zero density into account .",
    "the question whether in the latter case the above conclusions still hold remains to be studied . using the method of phenomenological form factors , we have also investigated the significance of vertex corrections .",

    "though , if in addition to @xmath3 other mesons are taken into account , the above problem does not occur , it still has to be studied and is being under study , because the coupling with @xmath3-mesons is of importance and according to their definitions and physical meanings , both @xmath285 and @xmath216 should be @xmath289 .",
