    "when a femtosecond laser pulse with power above the critical for self - focusing propagates in air , a number of new physical effects have been observed , such as long - range self - channeling @xcite , coherent and incoherent ghz and thz emission @xcite , asymmetric pulse shaping , super - broad spectra @xcite , self - compression @xcite , polarization rotation @xcite and others .",
    "a remarkable effect is also that some of the light pulses propagate over distances of several kilometers in vertical traces , preserving their spectrum and shapes @xcite .",
    "in one typical experiment in the near zone up to @xmath1 @xmath2 from the source , when the pulse s intensity exceeds @xmath3 , initial self - focusing and self - compressing starts , which leads to enlarging the @xmath4 spectrum to broad band asymmetric one @xmath5 .",
    "the process increases the core intensity up to @xmath6 , where a short non - homogenous plasma column in the nonlinear focus is observed .",
    "usually the standard model describing the propagation in the near zone is a scalar spatio - temporal nonlinear paraxial equation including in addition terms with plasma ionization , higher order kerr terms , multiphoton ionization and others @xcite .",
    "the basic model works properly in the near zone because of the fact , that paraxial approximation is valid for pulses with narrow - band spectrum @xmath7 . in the far - away zone plasma generation and higher - order kerr terms",
    "are also included as necessary for the balance between the self - focussing and plasma defocussing and for obtaining long range self - channeling in gases .",
    "however , the above explanation of filamentation is difficult to be applied in the far - away zone .",
    "as reviewed in @xcite the plasma density at long distances from the source is to small to prevent self - focusing .",
    "there are basically three main characteristics which remain the same at these distances - the broad - band spectrum , coherent ghz generation and the width of the core , while the intensity in a stable filament drops to a value of @xmath8 .",
    "the higher - order kerr terms for pulses with intensities of order of @xmath9 are also too small to prevent self - focussing .",
    "the experiments , where observation of long - range self - channeling without ionization was realized @xcite , show the needing to change the role of the plasma in the laser filamentation .",
    "in addition , there are difficulties with the physical interpretation of the coherent ghz radiation as a result of plasma generation .",
    "the light pulse near the nonlinear focus emits incoherent and _ non - homogenous _ plasma , while the coherent ghz radiation requires _ homogenous _ plasma with fixed electron density of the order of @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "only homogenous plasma can generate coherent ghz emission , but such kind of plasma absent in the process of filamentation . in the experiments the following basic characteristic of the long - range filaments in air",
    "are detected :    \\1 . broad - band spectrum ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "intensity a little above of the value for self - focusing ( @xmath13 @xmath14 ) .",
    "absence of plasma at long distances .",
    "asymmetric relatively stable ( lorentz ) spectral and longitudinal forms .",
    "coherent ghz generation .",
    "recently in @xcite was developed scalar ionization - free non - paraxial nonlinear model which gives the above characteristics of the stable filament .",
    "the analytical and the numerical results describes correctly the linear and nonlinear evolution of narrow - band and broad - band laser pulses and in addition it was found , that the equation admits exact lorentz - type soliton solutions in approximation of neglecting the ghz oscillation .",
    "nevertheless this theory encountered significant difficulties .",
    "the main problems are :    \\1 .",
    "peak instability of the soliton solution under small initial perturbations .",
    "the soliton solution is obtained after neglecting the ghz oscillation .",
    "the soliton solution admits one free parameter .",
    "there are problems with the conservation law of the nonlinear operator , when we use the ghz oscillation .    to solve the above problems we propose in this paper a nonlinear vector model .",
    "the self - action process broadens the pulse spectrum - starting with narrow - band pulse , the stable filament becomes broad - band far way from the source . from other hand ,",
    "the standard filamentation model based on plasma generation and multi - photon processes includes also nonlinear polarization of the kind    @xmath15,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the nonlinear refractive index of the isotropic media .",
    "the polarization ( [ nlkerr ] ) was proposed by maker and terhune in 1965 @xcite .",
    "if the electrical field contains one linear or circular component , the polarization ( [ nlkerr ] ) describes only the self - action effect , while in the case of two - component electrical filed @xmath17 additional terms appear , presenting cross - modulation and degenerate four - photon parametric mixing .",
    "the self - action process broadens the pulse spectrum - starting from narrow - band pulse , the stable filament becomes broad - band far way from the source .",
    "later in @xcite it is shown , that the evolution of broad - band pulses like filaments can not be described correctly by nonlinear polarization of the kind ( [ nlkerr ] ) .",
    "it is more correct to use the generalized nonlinear operator    @xmath18    which includes additional processes associated with third harmonic generation ( thg ) .",
    "the more precise analysis , presented in the paper , demonstrates that the polarization of kind ( [ nlth ] ) is not applicable to a scalar model , because the corresponding manley - rowe ( mr ) conservation laws are not satisfied .",

    "the dynamics of narrow - band laser pulses can be accurately described in the frame of paraxial optics .",
    "the filamentation experiments demonstrate a typical pulse evolution : the initial laser pulse @xmath37 possesses a relatively narrow - band spectrum @xmath38 and during the process the initial self - focusing and self - compression broadens the spectrum significantly .",
    "the broad - band spectrum @xmath39 is one of the basic characteristics of the stable filament .",
    "the evolution of the filament can not be further described in the frame of the nonlinear paraxial optics because the paraxial optics works correctly for narrow - band laser pulses only .",
    "recently , the evolution of broad - band laser pulses was described correctly within different non - paraxial models such as uppe @xcite or non - paraxial envelope equations @xcite .",
    "another standard restriction in the filamentation theory is the use of one - component scalar approximation of the electrical field @xmath40 .",
    "this approximation , though , is in contradiction with recent experimental results , where rotation of the polarization vector is observed @xcite .",
    "for this reason in the present paper we use the non - paraxial vector model up to second order of dispersion , in which the nonlinear effects are described by the nonlinear polarization components ( [ nlcirk ] ) .",

    "( [ syscirk1 ] ) is used in mind , that the left - hand and right - hand components are complex conjugated fields .",
    "this model describes the ionization - free filamentation regime and we will investigate the case , when the pulse intensities are slightly above to the critical one for self - focusing .",
    "the dispersion number in air is too small @xmath48 and we will use eqs . ( [ syscirk1 ] ) in approximation of the first order of dispersion .",

    "it can be seen directly that the frequency of oscillation is equal to the carrier to envelope ones @xmath61 .",
    "the corresponding longitudinal spatial carrier to envelope wave number is @xmath62 . in standard atmosphere",
    "this complies to a rotation of the electrical field vector with period in @xmath63 direction @xmath64 @xmath65 .",
    "other important characteristic of the vector solution ( [ refield ] ) is that it is soliton in _",

    "in this investigation we point that in the femtosecond region it is impossible to reduce the nonlinearity of third order to the scalar kerr type only ( proportional to the intensity ) .",
