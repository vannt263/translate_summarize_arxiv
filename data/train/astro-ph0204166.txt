    "there is no generally accepted overall picture of the spiral arm structure in the galaxy , although we do know that there are star forming regions beyond the perseus arm @xcite .",
    "the region bg 2107 + 49 , for instance , is known to be at r@xmath11=14 kpc @xcite and @xcite found ob stars at galactocentric radii of r@xmath11=15 to 25 kpc .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite reported regions at r@xmath1218 kpc and @xcite found molecular clouds associated with h@xmath13 emission at r@xmath11=18 to 28 kpc , whose kinetic temperature was comparable to that of local star forming regions . one of the clouds they found , designated as cloud 2 , has a kinematic distance of r@xmath1428 kpc @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have observed young stellar objects associated with cloud 2 and suggested a smaller galactocentric distance ( @xmath15 kpc ) .",
    "in addition recent data show that cloud 2 is associated with a larger ring ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gsh  @xmath16 ) .",
    "these authors interpret this object as snowplowed material resulting from a single supernova ( sn ) event .",
    "the optical disk of the galaxy may extend as far as 20 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the atomic gas , on the other hand , extends to a much greater radius ; r@xmath1230 kpc .",
    "detection of star forming and regions beyond the optical disk provides information about the composition of the galactic disk .",
    "the presence of these regions could explain the ionization of the diffuse gas at these large distances and hence give the extent of the magneto - ionic medium in the galaxy .",
    "at these distances the only possible objects which may be linked to the observed ionized gas are stars ; because the general interstellar radiation field is weaker , metallicity is lower @xcite and there is less cosmic ray flux @xcite .",
    "regions far from the galactic center are in fact a common phenomenon in spiral galaxies similar to the milky way . @xcite",
    "have detected h@xmath17 emission from star forming regions in the extreme outer regions of the three nearby late - type spiral galaxies , ngc  628 , ngc  1058 and ngc  6946 .",
    "@xcite identified 137 hii regions beyond a radius of @xmath18 kpc with narrow - band h@xmath17 imaging in the galaxy ngc  628 .",
    "m31 also has stellar activity in its outer disk ; @xcite found a population of b stars correlated with the extended distribution of m31 .    with the increasing distance from the sun , the spatial resolution of the telescopes decreases . while single - antenna data can be used to probe the cloud concentrations @xcite , to resolve these structures high resolution data",
    "are required .",
    "the new data at @xmath19 arcminute resolution provided by the canadian galactic plane survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cgps ) are well suited to study the structure and dynamics of regions at the edge of and even beyond the optical disk .",
    "such a structure detected serendipitously south of the snr hb  21 in the cgps database is the topic of this paper .",
    "this paper makes an attempt to clarify the possible origin of such large structures far from the galactic center .",
    "we analyze the spectral line data together with the available continuum data at 1420 mhz and infrared data to show that the detected structure is the result of joint action of strong winds from early type stars and supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "we demonstrate that spectral line observations provide a very efficient method of tracing stellar activity at large distances from the galactic center , but not many such structures have been detected because of the lack of data of sufficiently high resolution covering large areas .",
    "line observations were carried out with the dominion radio astrophysical observatory ( drao ) synthesis telescope @xcite as part of the cgps .",
    "a detailed description of the data processing routines can be found in @xcite .",
    "the low spatial frequency hi data are from the low resolution drao survey of the cgps region observed with the drao 26-m telescope @xcite .",
    "parameters relevant for the data are given in table  [ spec ] .",
    "we have detected an shell at @xmath20 in the survey data of the cgps ( see fig .  [ ch1 ] and [ ch2 ] )",
    ". a shell - like structure appears in the foreground perseus arm gas at about @xmath390 km s@xmath4 .",
    "it slowly expands and gets more prominent with higher negative velocities .",
    "it is best pronounced at a velocity of @xmath399 km s@xmath4 . at further negative velocities",
    "it becomes smaller and fainter until it disappears at about @xmath3114 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we call this structure gsh  @xmath21 , in accordance with the current nomenclature for galactic atomic shells .    the atomic hydrogen map integrated between @xmath394 and @xmath22106 km s@xmath4",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ himap ] .",
    "the structure is about @xmath235@xmath91@xmath24 in size .",
    "the radial velocity of @xmath2299 km s@xmath4 corresponds to a kinematic distance of 13 kpc , which would give our structure a linear size of 110@xmath9220 pc , in @xmath0 and @xmath2 , according to a flat galactic rotation curve with r@xmath25 kpc and @xmath26 km s@xmath4 . toward the structure",
    "there is very faint 1420 mhz continuum and infrared emission . in fig .",
    "[ lb ] we display the longitude - velocity diagram of the structure . behind the perseus arm at the exact center of the detected structure",
    "we see a shell like feature moving toward us , while the receding part is buried in the perseus arm gas at lower negative velocities .",
    "this structure extends up to @xmath3114 km s@xmath4 . as a result",
    "the deduced expansion velocity of the ring is @xmath2715 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the mass of the structure is about 10@xmath28 m@xmath29 , which together with the expansion velocity gives a kinetic energy of @xmath30 erg currently in the expanding shell , comparable to the explosion energy of an snr .",
    "however , at such a low expansion velocity the snr should already be at the end of the radiative phase with most of its energy radiated away and therefore no longer `` visible '' in continuum emission .",
    "the kinematic age of the observed shell @xmath31 , with a mean radius @xmath32 pc , would result in an age @xmath33 yr for a radiative supernova remnant ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 yr for a supershell ( @xmath36 ) . for gsh  @xmath16 ,",
    "these values are @xmath37 yr and @xmath38 yr , respectively .",
    "apparently the object is too old to be an snr , which typically has an observable lifespan of @xmath39 yr .",
    "this obtained age , on the other hand is young in comparison to the distant galactic shells listed by @xcite , which are @xmath40 yr old , have typical energies @xmath41 erg and are usually up to 10 times larger than the detected structure .",
    "nevertheless , the object has a mass comparable to that of distant galactic shells and yet a size comparable to that of local shells .",
    "for instance , the local bubble , north polar spur and gum nebula are just twice as large as this shell @xcite .",
    "we have checked the region in the columbia co survey @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence of associated molecular material .",
    "however this survey has coarse angular resolution and is undersampled . especially the area of interest has a low signal - to - noise ratio ; a signal below 0.5 k could not be detected .",
    "the maximum molecular hydrogen column density would be @xmath42 @xmath43 per km s@xmath4 . assuming a molecular material distribution comparable to the atomic hydrogen distribution , a maximum molecular mass of @xmath44 in the velocity interval , shown in fig .  1",
    ", for instance , could stay undetected .",
    "thus , non - detection in the columbia data does not necessarily mean that there is no molecular gas in the region .",
    "regions are expected to include stars .",
    "however , stellar light suffers from absorption and reddening by the intervening material .",
    "therefore , beyond a certain distance stars of an region can not be observed .",
    "at the north - western part of the structure there is the uv star lan  110 @xcite , at @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we have calculated the absorption profile of a nearby extragalactic source at @xmath47 and thereby found a foreground column density of 9.6@xmath910@xmath48 @xmath43 . combining that with the observed optical parameters of the star results in a color of @xmath491.85 .",
    "an o3 star would have @xmath501.22 .",
    "therefore , this uv star must be located in front of the perseus arm rather than behind it .",
    "this star is apparently not related to the detected structure .",
    "this also demonstrates that the detection of stars within the structure would be difficult .    to clarify whether massive stars in the structure are observable",
    ", we have calculated extinction and reddening of typical o and early b type stars , based on the foreground column density and the distance . the measured foreground column density is 9.6@xmath51 @xmath43 , which corresponds to a reddening of @xmath52 as given by @xcite .",
    "this gives a visual extinction of @xmath53 magnitude .",
    "a typical , main - sequence o3 star has an absolute magnitude @xmath54 and color indices @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the above reddening and extinction in turn correspond to apparent visual magnitudes of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    for a main - sequence b1 star , with @xmath60 and color indices @xmath61 and",
    "@xmath62 , the above calculation yields visual magnitudes @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we note that , for both o3 and b1 stars the observed color indices are @xmath66 and @xmath67 . @xcite",
    "have detected stars in the range from @xmath68 to @xmath69 , and in magnitude from @xmath70 to @xmath71 in this region .",
    "therefore , stars with positive @xmath72 , as those which were mentioned above , are missing in their list .",
    "these calculations show that deep measurements have to be made in order to detect early type stars which may contribute to the energy budget of the ring by their stellar winds",
    ".    near infrared measurements , on the other hand , might provide further hints about the existence of embedded , young ob clusters inside the structure like those found in gsh  @xmath16 @xcite , since there exists an infrared source in the area enclosed by the shell ( see sect .  [ sec4 ] ) . however , such sensitive near infrared data toward gsh  @xmath21 are currently not available .",
    "the infrared source iras 20565 + 5003 is located almost at the center of the structure . according to @xcite the flux ratios 25@xmath8m/12@xmath8 m ( @xmath73 ) and 60@xmath8m/12@xmath8 m ( @xmath74 ) indicate a compact region .",
    "the observed infrared intensities for our source ( 0.91 , 3.50 and 31.57 jy , at 12 , 25 and 60 @xmath8 m , respectively ) make this source a strong candidate for an region .",
    "@xcite observed 10 iras point sources , at distances r@xmath11 15 to 18 kpc , with the vla at 2 and 6 cm .",
    "they found the spectral indices of these sources are consistent with the optically thin free - free emission from regions , signaling stellar activity at large distances .",
    "the distance of iras 20565 + 5003 is unknown and we have only circumstantial evidence that it is located within the ring .",
    "therefore an association between the two is not certain , although the positional coincidence is attractive and compelling .",
    "other iras sources in the region are away from the hi structure or do not satisfy the required infrared ratio criteria .",
    "the region bfs  4 at @xmath75 is also in the region .",
    "however , the observed radial velocity , 1.1@xmath760.5 km s@xmath4 @xcite , of bfs  4 implies that it is a local object .",
    "the observed structure may be attributed to an old snr , which has already cooled to temperatures where ionized hydrogen recombines and creates the observed shell . assuming the structure is the result of such an event we can calculate the maximum radius of the snr as a function of the explosion energy and the ambient density .",
    "the mass of the observed structure is about 10@xmath77  m@xmath29 , comparable to a typical giant molecular cloud , assuming the gas is optically thin .",
    "thus , we obtain n@xmath782.0 @xmath79 before the structure was formed . due to the high galactocentric radius of the ring",
    ", we have to take the metallicity into account , because lower metallicity causes slower cooling , which in turn results in a lower energy loss rate .",
    "hence in the outer galaxy snrs live longer .",
    "there are two recent publications dealing with the dynamics of snrs at late stages of their evolution taking metallicity effects into account @xcite , latter based on the central equations of the former .",
    "both discuss the so - called radiative expansion or snowplow phase at the end of snr evolution .",
    "this phase consists of two parts : the cooling dominated first part and later the merger with the interstellar medium . at the end of the first part the snr is no longer distinguishable from the environment .",
    "thus we adopt the radius at the end of the first part as the maximum observable radius of an snr .",
    "following @xcite the maximum radius is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the explosion energy in units of 10@xmath82 erg , @xmath83 is the mean ambient particle density in @xmath79 , and @xmath84 is the metallicity normalized to the solar value .    using this model we can estimate the energy required if the ring is the result of a single sn explosion . since eqn .  [",
    "merge ] provides the maximum radius , the corresponding explosion energy will be a lower limit for the energy requirement .",
    "results obtained from this calculation for gsh  @xmath21 and gsh  @xmath16 , discovered by @xcite , are given in table  [ pds ] .    in order to reduce the required explosion energy",
    "the snr would have to be closer .",
    "we have calculated the mass of the structure from the observed hydrogen column density .",
    "therefore it is proportional to the square of the distance , implying a linear dependence of @xmath83 on distance , @xmath85 . combining this with eqn  [ merge ] we obtain @xmath86",
    ". the maximum distance , @xmath87 , we would obtain for an explosion energy of @xmath88 erg is also given in table  [ pds ] .",
    "consequently , for the single snr explanation the maximum distance of the structures , as calculated above put these objects significantly closer .",
    "the systemic velocities corresponding to the @xmath87 values for these two objects lie between @xmath89 and @xmath90 km s@xmath4 for gsh  @xmath21 and @xmath90 and @xmath91 km s@xmath4 for gsh  @xmath16 .",
    "these velocities , however , contradict the observed systemic values and require extremely high random motions never observed before .",
    "therefore , we find such a close distance , hence a single snr origin , for both of the objects _ highly _ unlikely .",
    "we should emphasize that all calculated values are extrema , making the single snr hypothesis even more unlikely .    a single o type or an early b type star would create a stellar wind bubble of radius @xcite @xmath92 which in turn gives about 45 pc for the ring , with the above ambient density .",
    "the corresponding radius of a wind bubble for gsh  @xmath16 , is 83 pc .",
    "therefore an association of several massive stars would be sufficient to form such bubbles . by comparing the snr and wind - bubble calculations above ,",
    "we conclude that a structure formed by a sn explosion and a stellar wind bubble would have comparable characteristics .",
    "thus , the shells discussed in this paper could be formed by approximately equal numbers of sn explosions or winds of massive stars .",
    "we find that a single sn event or a stellar wind bubble of a single massive star can not be held responsible for the formation of such big structures .",
    "an ob association hidden within the structure , however , would create enough stellar wind power to carve such a region .",
    "additionally , one must take into account the fact that these young stars will sometime become sn , contributing to the energy budget of the big structure .",
    "stars are usually formed in groups and the creation of a single and yet massive star alone seems to be improbable .",
    "we note that both of the structures discussed here have comparable characteristics .",
    "one exception is that gsh  @xmath16 was first detected as an concentration from the maryland - green bank survey @xcite , later detected in co emission @xcite .",
    "an early type b - star is reported to be associated with it ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  mr  1  ) .",
    "the radial velocity of mr  1 ( * ? ? ? * @xmath93 km s@xmath4 ) is comparable to the velocity of gsh  @xmath16 .",
    "finally @xcite and @xcite confirmed the existence of the ionizing star and classified the object as an region .",
    "such associated objects are not known towards gsh  @xmath21 , since there are no such deep measurements .",
    "however its similarity to gsh  @xmath16 strengthen the hypothesis that it contains stellar activity .",
    "we reported the detection of an expanding hydrogen shell ( gsh  @xmath21 ) most likely powered by a group of massive stars in its center .",
    "we interpret gsh  @xmath16 recently discovered by @xcite as another example of a sn / ob - association powered bubble at a large distance .",
    "we think this is a common phenomenon and we expect the detection of similar objects in the future .",
    "the size of gsh  @xmath21 is 110@xmath9220 pc at a distance of 13 kpc .",
    "it contains 10@xmath28 m@xmath29 of neutral material and is expanding at 15 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this gives a kinetic energy of @xmath30 erg .",
    "if ob associations are sufficiently distant , it becomes difficult to detect the optical emission from their members . in this case atomic and molecular gas are their best tracers and a survey with high angular resolution , covering a large area of the galactic plane is ideal for their detection .",
    "spectral information is decisive to distinguish the snrs from regions ; but at large distances , due to low surface brightness , this information is usually unavailable .",
    "therefore , energetics of the observed structures become important to characterize these objects . , being unaffected by interstellar absorption , is an easily detectable tracer of objects at large distances , and is also very efficient for the study of their kinematics .",
