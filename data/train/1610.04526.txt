    "the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of black holes @xcite , present a discrete set of complex frequencies corresponding to the solutions of the perturbation equations .",
    "the qnms depend only on black hole parameters but not depend on the initial perturbation .",
    "in general , the imaginary part of the complex frequencies are associated with the decay timescale of the perturbation while the real part represents the actual frequency of the oscillation .",
    "the qnms are of the great importance in black hole physics , gravitational wave astrophysics , and might be observed in existing or advanced gravitational wave detectors such as ligo @xcite , and virgo @xcite . during last decades , a lot of authors had focused on the qnms of black holes in asymptotically flat spacetime @xcite , asymptotically ( anti-)de sitter ( henceforth ads or ds ) spacetimes @xcite , scalar perturbation @xcite , gravitational perturbation @xcite , dirac perturbation @xcite , and electromagnetic perturbation @xcite , in different backgrounds . some pioneer work",
    "have extended the investigation of qnms to higher dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "indeed , the qnms contain information on the parameters of the underlying black hole and hence have significance in identifying black holes in four and higher dimensions .",
    "recently , the possiblity of production of tev - scale black holes @xcite at particle colliders such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have attracted much attention to the models of low scale gravity @xcite .",
    "black holes in higher dimensional spacetime have attracted a lot of interest within different theories such as supersymmetric string theory and different extra dimensional scenarios namely arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) @xcite and randall - sundrum @xcite ( rs ) brane world models ( for a review see @xcite ) . in this way , based upon the fact that our universe may be embedded in higher dimensional spacetime , much interest has been paid to the rs model to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem . in the context of the rs brane world scenario ,",
    "there has been an attempt to construct numerical black holes , being successful only in working out small localized black holes @xcite and some remarks were made in terms of the ads / cft correspondence as to why finding black hole solution localized on the rs brane is so difficult that large black holes will not be static @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we discuss the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of charged brane world black holes in the randall sundrum model considering both the electromagnetic and tidal charges effects as well as the thickness of the bulk .",
    "there are several techniques to compute the qnms , such as the potential fit @xcite , leaver s continued fraction method @xcite , wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) @xcite , etc . here",
    ", we study the qnms of charged black holes embedded on the rs brane world considering quantum gravity effects and using the 3th order wkb approximation as the results do improve for higher orders of wkb @xcite . we discuss in detail how the qnms are influenced by the parameters of higher dimensional black hole on bulk spacetime .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we set up the basic notion and formalism of the charged black hole localized on the rs brane world and we obtain the effective potential , solving 5-dimensional klein - gordon wave equation . in section iii",
    "we compute quasinormal modes of the charged black hole in brane world using 3th order wkb approximation . in the last section a summary of results , conclusions and discussion",
    "are given .",
    "in order to obtain the charged black hole solution localized on the randall - sundrum ( rs)@xcite brane world , we start with the action of the rs model in ( 4 + 1 ) dimensions as follows @xmath0 }   - \\int { { d^4}x\\left [ { \\sqrt { - { g _ + } } { \\lambda _ + } + \\sqrt { - { g _ - } } { \\lambda _ - } } \\right ] } } \\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a cosmological constant while @xmath2 and @xmath3 are tensions of the branes at @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively which are two singular points on the orbifold @xmath6 located at @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here , two 3-branes are placed at these points and we assume that orbifold possesses a periodicity in the extra coordinate @xmath9 , identifying @xmath10 with @xmath9 . in this case , one can define the metric on each brane as @xmath11 we assume that the induced metric on the brane take the general form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the lapse function which describes embedding geometry of the hyper surface spanned by @xmath14 during the evolution in the bulk spacetime and @xmath15 is a metric of unit @xmath16-sphere . among possible solution satisfying the equation of motion @xcite",
    ", we consider charged black hole solution in the rs model in which our universe is viewed as a domain wall in asymptotically ads space . in this case , using the hamiltonian constraint and solving hamiltonian equation along with metric ansatz ( 3 ) , one can obtain @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the mass of black hole . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are tidal and electromagnetic charges respectively and we use @xmath21 to denote the position of the outermost horizon which @xmath22 .",
    "we are interested in charges effects on the shape of perturbed horizon by scalar field , and how far it extends into the fifth dimension and this could be measured by the ratio of the physical size of the apparent horizon . in this case , the only apparent horizon that appears during the @xmath9 evolution is located at @xmath23 .",
    "it was shown in the appendix of @xcite that at @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 evolve synchronously , that is , @xmath26 and analytically continuing back to original spacetime yields @xmath27 . therefore , here for simplicity , we set @xmath28 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath29.\\ ] ] indeed , a randall sundrum type brane model is built up which has two branes at @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the solution ( 5 ) describes a charged black hole placed on the hypersurface at the fixed extra coordinates which in this brane background , the scalar field with mass @xmath32 , satisfies the klein - gordon wave equation as @xmath33 which one can write it explicitly as follow @xmath34\\\\ \\begin{array}{*{20}{c } } { } & { + { e^{4\\kappa \\chi}}{\\partial _ \\chi } } \\end{array}\\left ( { { e^ { - 4\\kappa \\chi}}{\\partial _ \\chi}\\phi } \\right ) - { m^2}\\phi   = 0 \\end{array}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 here , the separation of variables is easily possible if we set @xmath36 which is discussed in @xcite . in this case , the modes along the extra dimension are quantized by stable standing waves , and then the eigenvalue is naturally discretized as @xmath37 where the quantum parameter @xmath38 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath9 is the thickness of the bulk . in this way",
