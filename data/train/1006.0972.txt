    "the nature of the dark matter that comprises a quarter of the universe is one of the big unanswered questions in astrophysics and particle physics .",
    "perhaps the best motivated candidates are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) which have weakly interacting cross sections and masses in the gev10  tev range . in recent months",
    ", there have been new data releases from many experiments that have engendered a great deal of excitement .",
    "of particular interest is a low mass region @xmath3  gev which at first sight seems to be compatible with a number of different experiments .",
    "the goal of this paper is to examine some of the issues regarding the question of such compatibility . in this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves here to considering wimps with spin - independent ( si ) interactions .",
    "spin - dependent and mixed couplings will be examined in a future work .",
    "it was initially the dama / nai experiment @xcite , looking for annual modulation @xcite of a wimp signal , that found such a possible low mass region .",
    "wimps with si interactions in the mass range 59  gev were found to be compatible with the dama / nai results and all negative results from other searches that existed at the time  @xcite .",
    "the situation changed after the publication of the first dama / libra results @xcite ( see _ e.g. _   ref .",
    "@xcite and reference therein ) . for si interactions , ref .",
    "@xcite found that the best fit dama regions were ruled out to the 3@xmath2 c.l .",
    "but ref .",
    "@xcite also found that for wimp masses of @xmath08  gev , some parameters outside these regions still yielded a moderately reasonable fit to the dama data and were compatible with all 90% c.l .",
    "upper limits from negative searches , when ion channeling in the dama experiment as understood at the time was included ( see section  [ sec : channeling ] below ) .",
    "the strongest bounds at the time came from cdms @xcite and xenon10 @xcite . since then many new data sets have been released and a reexamination of the light wimp region is now necessary .",
    "we will focus on the following three factors : a possible dark matter signal for 7 - 12  gev wimp s found by the cogent collaboration  @xcite ; the existence of new better upper limits , in particular the bounds set by the xenon10  @xcite and xenon100  @xcite collaborations ; and the recognition that the effect of channeling in nai(tl ) crystal is less important than previously assumed  @xcite ( see section  [ sec : channeling ] ) .",
    "cdms @xcite has released its full data set , with tighter bounds and two unexplained events at low energy that may be compatible with background .",
    "cdms constraints will be included but are not a focus of this paper .",
    "our focus is on elastic scattering of spin - independent wimps from a standard maxwellian halo ; recent examinations comparing experimental studies in this case include @xcite .",
    "just prior to our paper being submitted , a revised version of ref .",
    "@xcite appeared that added an examination of xenon100 and @xmath1  in the context of scalar wimps .",
    "the halo model parameters and @xmath1  models used in that paper differ somewhat from ours , but the results are qualitatively similar .",
    "the interpretation of the xenon10 and xenon100 results requires the ability to reliably reconstruct the nuclear recoil energy from the observed signal .",
    "this depends on the scintillation efficiency factor @xmath1  for which there is considerable uncertainty at low energies ( see section  [ sec : leff ] ) .",
    "a large part of this paper is devoted to examining the @xmath1  dependence of the two xenon constraints .",
    "in this paper we focus on comparing the following experimental results : the combined modulation signal @xcite as well as the total rate @xcite from dama / nai and dama / libra ; the combined cdms 5-tower results @xcite ; the recent first results from xenon100 @xcite ; and the older but lower threshold xenon10 reanalysis results @xcite . constraints for cdms , xenon10 , and xenon100 are determined using the maximum gap method @xcite , while the parameters compatible with dama are determined via the goodness - of - fit of their observed modulation signal with the theoretically expected signal .",
    "details of these statistical analyses may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the two xenon experiments , we assume the energy resolution is primarily limited by a poisson distribution in the small number of photoelectrons ( pe ) expected at low recoil energies . interactions in the liquid xenon comprising the xenon10 and xenon100 detectors give rise to a prompt scintillation signal ( @xmath4 ) followed by a delayed secondary scintillation signal ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath4  and @xmath5  are discussed in the following section and the various thresholds and data cuts are described in _",
    "e.g. _   ref .",
    "the efficiencies for xenon10 and xenon100 are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively . however , for xenon10 , the @xmath4  peak finding efficiency factor @xmath6 , which was not included in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where it was not particularly relevant ) , must also be taken into account .",
    "for this @xmath6  factor , we take the more conservative of the two cases found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a second issue must also be taken into account .",
    "as explained in detail below , as the recoil energy decreases , so do the average @xmath4  and @xmath5  signals . at low enough energies ,",
    "a sizable fraction of the events may fail to produce enough @xmath5  signal and/or to fall in the proper @xmath7 range ( the nuclear recoil band cut ) , even if a fluctuation gives a high enough @xmath4 . at higher recoil energies , the relative size of the fluctuations get smaller and the average @xmath5  is too high for any significant fraction of the @xmath5  fluctuations to fall below the @xmath5  threshold . however , somewhere below an @xmath4  average of 1  photoelectron ( pe ) in xenon10 , an event would need not only an upward fluctuation in @xmath4 , but an upward fluctuation in @xmath5  to pass both thresholds and it would require particular ranges of fluctuations to fall within the required range for @xmath7 . thus , to avoid issues with the @xmath5  threshold and nuclear recoil band cuts , we ignore recoil energies that give on average less than 1  pe in the @xmath4  signal . we find that , with poisson fluctuations included , low energy recoils in xenon10 tend to pass the various thresholds and cuts at a higher rate than predicted by the efficiencies we use ; these efficiencies can thus be considered conservative over the range at which they are applied .",
    "additional events passing these various cuts can arise from low energy recoils that give an average @xmath4  signal @xmath8  that falls below our imposed cutoff of @xmath9  pe .",
    "accounting for these events will strengthen the xenon10 constraints at low wimp masses .",
    "our @xmath8  cutoff is simply due to the efficiency being unknown for these low energy recoils at this time .",
    "we are examining these low energy recoil efficiencies for a future work , though a comprehensive treatment of these efficiencies in xenon10 and xenon100 has appeared in the meantime @xcite .",
    "in addition to constraints for the above experiments , we also show the 7 - 12  gev wimp mass region suggested by cogent as an explanation for excess events seen at low energies in their detector @xcite .",
    "we perform our own statistical analyses of all data sets except cogent , for which we simply use their published region .    to allow for direct comparison ,",
    "all the other experimental constraints are determined using the same 600  km / s galactic halo escape velocity as used by cogent in their analysis @xcite .",
    "this escape velocity falls within the 90% confidence interval of 498  km / s to 608  km / s that was determined by a recent analysis of high velocity stars @xcite , but is somewhat above the median likelihood of 544  km / s that was found in that analysis .",
    "similarly , we use throughout the value 220  km / sec ( used by cogent ) for the rotation velocity of the galactic disk in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "we note that new measurements suggest that the rotation velocity might be higher , @xmath10  km / s @xcite , the effect of which is to shift the best fit in all experiments to slightly lower wimp masses @xcite .    * comparison with version one of this paper : * we have made two substantial changes , as discussed in the previous paragraphs .",
    "first , we have included the effects of @xmath6 , the @xmath4   peak finding efficiency factor . with this factor included , the xenon10 constraints shift upwards in scattering cross - section by at most @xmath0  @xmath111.7 at any given wimp mass , not by several orders of magnitude ( as was speculated in ref .",
    "second , in the current version we do not include recoil energies which yield on average less than 1.0  pe in the @xmath4  signal .",
    "it is this second issue that is by far the bigger effect .",
    "a more complete discussion can be found in the appendix .",
    "in addition , in the appendix we respond to various critiques of our work .",
    "in this section we discuss two important experimental issues .",
    "first , the scintillation factor in xenon @xmath1  is extremely important in interpreting results and yet is not well known .",
    "second , the channeling effect in dama / libra , again not well known , may change the location of the regions in wimp parameter space that are compatible with the data .",
    "the interpretation of the xenon10 and xenon100 results requires the ability to reliably reconstruct the nuclear recoil energy from the observed signal .",
    "this reconstruction depends on the scintillation efficiency factor @xmath1  for which there is considerable uncertainty at low energies .",
    "here we discuss this factor and present three models for @xmath1  at low energy .",
    "interactions in the liquid xenon comprising the xenon10 and xenon100 detectors give rise to a prompt scintillation signal , @xmath4 , followed by a delayed secondary scintillation signal , @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath4  signal arises from a rapid relaxation of excited xenon states produced as a result of the interaction .",
    "the @xmath5  signal arises from ionized electrons also produced in the interaction ; these drift through the liquid xenon under an applied electric field , but once they reach the liquid surface they are extracted into a xenon gas phase where they emit proportional scintillation light .",
    "the drift time of the electrons causes this secondary scintillation ( the @xmath5  signal ) to be observed later than the @xmath4  signal , allowing both scintillation signals to be measured separately .",
    "the @xmath4  signal can be used to determine the energy of the interaction , while the combination of both signals allows discrimination between nuclear recoil events ( possibly wimp interactions ) and electron recoil events ( necessarily background interactions ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath5  to @xmath4  is much higher in the case of electron recoils than in the case of nuclear recoils .",
    "interpretation of the xenon results requires the ability to reliably reconstruct the nuclear recoil energy @xmath12  from the observed @xmath4   signal .",
    "calibration of the nuclear recoil energy dependence of @xmath4   often involves gauging the detector s response to electron recoils at higher energies ; parts of the detector s response ( _ e.g. _  the fraction of scintillation photons that yield photoelectrons ( pe ) in the photodetectors ) are more easily determined in this case than with nuclear recoils at lower energies .",
    "taking @xmath4  to be normalized to the number of pe , @xmath4  and @xmath12  are related by an equation involving the higher energy electron recoil calibrations : @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the light yield in pe / kevee for 122  kevee @xmath15-rays .",
    "@xmath1(@xmath12 ) is the scintillation efficiency of nuclear recoils relative to 122  kevee @xmath15-rays in zero electric field ; this factor is a function of the nuclear recoil energy .",
    "since there is an applied electric field in the experiment , which reduces the scintillation yield by quickly removing charged particles from the original interaction region , two additional factors must be taken into account : @xmath16  and @xmath17  are the suppression in the scintillation yield for electronic and nuclear recoils , respectively , due to the presence of the electric field in the detector volume .",
    "the quantities @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath14 are detector dependent ; @xmath1  is not .",
    "recent comments have drawn attention to the role that @xmath1determinations play in setting experimental constraints for xenon - based detectors @xcite .",
    "a variety of @xmath1  measurements have been made over the years @xcite , but limited statistics and systematics issues have so far prevented a clear picture from emerging as to the behavior of @xmath1  at low recoil energies .",
    "there are two primary issues in debate : ( 1 ) which of the @xmath1  measurements should be used as a basis for analyzing direct detection results ? and ( 2 )",
    "measurements of @xmath1   have only been made at energies above some minimum ; what is the behavior of @xmath1  at low energies , where no measurements have as yet been made ? for the first issue , the xenon100 collaboration has chosen to use a global fit to multiple @xmath1  measurements in their analysis , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that the recent measurements by manzur _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite should be used ; in both cases , @xmath1  measurements are based upon fixed energy neutron scatters .",
    "we do not contribute to the debate as to which @xmath1  data sets are most appropriate ; however , in the interest of examining the most conservative xenon constraints , we use the manzur _",
    "et  al . _",
    "data alone in our analyses .",
    "the choice of @xmath1  measurements to use in the xenon analyses has a significant impact on the resulting constraints for low wimp masses .",
    "the manzur _",
    "et  al . _",
    "data yield the lowest values for @xmath1   among the fixed - energy neutron scatter measurements , implying the highest recoil energy thresholds and therefore the lowest sensitivity for the xenon detectors to low mass wimps ( which generate only low energy recoils ) .",
    "the manzur _",
    "et  al . _",
    "data is shown in figure  [ fig : leff ] .",
    "a comment is in order about the lower zeplin - iii @xmath1  measurement @xcite represented as a band in fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "zeplin fits a nonlinear @xmath1  model to their broad spectrum nuclear recoil calibration data to obtain @xmath1  curves that were used in their analysis .",
    "these fits suggest a constant @xmath1  at recoil energies above @xmath030  kevnr , with @xmath1   sharply falling at energies below @xmath020  kevnr and approaching zero at @xmath07 - 8  kevnr ; see figure  15 of ref .",
    "@xcite and the accompanying text .",
    "thus the suggestion has been made by nonmembers of the zeplin team @xcite that @xmath1  should be taken to be zero below @xmath08  kevnr as a conservative model of @xmath1 .",
    "this @xmath1  model would yield significantly weaker xenon constraints relative to what we have referred to as conservative models based on the manzur _",
    "_   measurements of @xmath1  @xcite . however , the members of the zeplin experiment themselves do not advocate their fits as being an indicator of @xmath1  behavior at recoil energies below @xmath0 8  kevnr @xcite .",
    "in addition , the dependence of these curves on statistical and systematic uncertainties has not been fully determined , where these uncertainties can significantly impact the lowest recoil energy portion of their fits .",
    "the zeplin - iii dark matter analysis is , in fact , mainly insensitive to the low recoil energy portion of their @xmath1  curves .",
    "further discussion of the zeplin data can be found in the appendix . moreover , as explained in detail in the appendix , below the recoil energies of 7  kevnr , the manzur _",
    "et  al . _",
    "measurements are incompatible with @xmath18 at far more than the 3@xmath2 level .",
    "we consider the manzur _",
    "_   measurements more reliable than the zeplin - iii estimate of @xmath1  at low energies .",
    "the second issue in debate is how @xmath1  behaves at energies below where measurements have been made .",
    "most @xmath1  measurements are at recoil energies above 5  kevnr ; manzur _ et  al .",
    "_  have a measurement at @xmath19  kevnr .",
    "the @xmath1  behavior below these energies is unclear from an experimental and theoretical standpoint , at least at the precision necessary for use in a wimp constraint analysis .",
    "the xenon collaboration has suggested that @xmath1  measurements are consistent with @xmath1  being effectively constant at low recoil energies , at least at energies where recoils may contribute to their signal @xcite .",
    "various @xmath1  measurements are also consistent with an @xmath1  that decreases as one goes to lower recoil energies ; see _ e.g. _  sect .",
    "v of ref .",
    "@xcite which provides a theoretically motivated empirical model of such a decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite states that `` the mechanisms behind the generation of _ any _ significant amount of scintillation are still unknown and may simply be absent at the few kevnr level . ''",
    "given this uncertainty we use three different extrapolations of @xmath1  at low energies : constant , decreasing as one goes to lower recoil energies , or just zero .",
    "we choose as our fiducial @xmath1  model a piecewise linear interpolation between the central manzur _",
    "_  values at their measured energies , shown in figure  [ fig : leff ] .",
    "in addition , we will also examine similarly constructed @xmath1  models using the 1@xmath2 uncertainties in the manzur _",
    "_  measurements  are added in quadrature with the upper and lower uncertainties averaged ; uncertainties in the corresponding recoil energies for those measurements have been neglected . ] .",
    "the choice of linear interpolation vs.  a quadratic interpolation or spline fit to the @xmath1  points has a negligle impact on the generated constraints compared to that from the 1@xmath2 variations in the @xmath1  points themselves .",
    "below recoil energies of 3.9  kevnr , the lowest manzur _",
    "et  al . _",
    "measurement at 3.9  kevnr , where the two errors in the first case are the statistical and systematic uncertainties , respectively , and the second case is the combined uncertainty as described in the previous footnote . ] , we examine three behaviors for @xmath1 , also shown in figure  [ fig : leff ] : ( 1 ) a constant @xmath1 , ( 2 ) an @xmath1  that goes linearly to zero at zero recoil energy , and ( 3 ) an @xmath1  that is strictly zero . even if the scintillation goes to zero at some low but finite recoil energy , there is no reason to expect this to occur above @xmath02 - 3  kevnr ; the measurements of @xmath1  provide no indication of an abrupt ( rather than gradual ) falling of @xmath1  at energies just below where the measurements exist . as such , the third case is perhaps unrealistically conservative , but never - the - less provides the most conservative case . in addition , the use of this case will allow us to examine the contribution of low energy recoils in generating constraints .",
    "the average @xmath4  signals as a function of the nuclear recoil energy @xmath12  that correspond to these @xmath1  models are shown in figure  [ fig : s1enr ] for xenon10 and xenon100 .    in the interest of examining the most conservative xenon constraints ,",
    "we base all three cases on the data from manzur _ et  al . _  @xcite . of the existing data sets , the manzur _",
    "et  al . _",
    "data yield the lowest values for @xmath1 , implying higher recoil energy thresholds for the xenon experiments , and thereby reducing the sensitivity of xenon to low mass wimps .",
    "the channeling effect is of crucial importance when considering the compatibility of dama with other experimental results as this effect has the potential to significantly alter the wimp masses and cross - sections which are compatible with the dama modulation signal .    channeling and blocking effects in crystals refer to the orientation dependence of charged ion penetration in crystals . in the `` channeling effect , '' ions incident upon a crystal along",
    "symmetry axes and planes suffer a series of small - angle scattering that maintain them in the open``channels '' in between the rows or planes of lattice atoms and thus penetrate much further into the crystal than in other directions .",
    "channeled incident ions do not get close to lattice sites , where they would be deflected at large angles , and they lose energy almost exclusively into electrons .",
    "the `` blocking effect '' consists in a reduction of the flux of ions originating in lattice sites along symmetry axes and planes , creating what is called a `` blocking dip '' in the flux of ions exiting from a thin enough crystal as a function of the exit angle with respect to a particular symmetry axis or plane .",
    "the potential importance of the channeling effect for direct dark matter detection was first pointed out by h.  sekiya _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite and subsequently for nai(tl ) by drobyshevski  @xcite and by the dama collaboration  @xcite .",
    "when na or i ions recoiling after a collision with a dark matter wimp are channeled , their quenching factor is the ratio of ionization or scintillation produced by a nuclear recoil event in a crystal relative to that produced in an electron recoil event of the same energy .",
    "this is analogous to the @xmath1  factor in liquid xenon and is likewise used to reconstruct the nuclear recoil energy from the observed ionization / scintillation of an event . ]",
    "is approximately @xmath20 instead of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , since they give their energy to electrons .",
    "the dama collaboration  @xcite estimated the fraction of channeled recoils and found it to be large for low recoiling energies in the kev range . using this evaluation of the channeling fraction ,",
    "the regions in cross - section versus mass of acceptable wimp models in agreement with the dama data were found to be considerably shifted towards lower wimp masses and cross - sections .",
    "however , the dama calculation of the channeling fraction did not take into account that the recoiling lattice ions start initially from lattice sites ( or very close to them ) and , therefore , blocking effects are important .",
    "in fact , as argued originally by lindhard  @xcite , in a perfect lattice and in the absence of energy - loss processes , the probability of a particle starting from a lattice site to be channeled would be zero .",
    "the argument uses statistical mechanics in which the probability of particle paths related by time - reversal is the same . in a perfectly rigid lattice",
    ", the fraction of channeled recoils would , in fact , be zero .",
    "however , the atoms in a crystal are actually vibrating about their equilibrium positions in the lattice .",
    "it is this displacement from equilibrium that allows for a non - zero channeling probability of recoiling ions",
    ". the vibration amplitude increases with the temperature , thus the effect is temperature dependent : in general the channeling fraction increases with temperature .",
    "upper bounds to the recoiling channeling fractions in nai(tl ) crystals at 20@xmath23c were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , using analytic models of channeling developed since the 1960 s , when channeling was discovered ( see for example refs .  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these upper bounds on the channeling fractions were obtained with temperature effects taken into account not only through the vibrations of the colliding nucleus but also in the lattice . the latter depend on the parameter @xmath24 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) which in the relevant literature is found to be a number between 1 and 2 , with 1 giving the largest channeling fractions ( see figure  [ fig : frac - roomt ] , reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the fractions shown in figure  [ fig : frac - roomt ] are also an upper bound in that no dechanneling mechanism has been taken into account to compute them .",
    "the collisions with tl impurities would take channeled ions out of their channel , and this process is not included ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further explanations ) .",
    "in figure  [ fig : dama ] , we show the wimp masses and si cross - sections compatible with the dama modulation signal both with and without channeling included ; contours are shown for regions compatible at the 7@xmath2 , 5@xmath2 , 3@xmath2 , and 90% level ( in order from larger to smaller regions ) . for the channeling",
    ", we use the largest channeling fractions shown in figure  [ fig : frac - roomt ] as they provide the largest potential effect on the dama constraints .",
    "figure  [ fig : dama ] shows that even in this case there is negligible difference between the channeling and non - channeling scenarios except for regions incompatible with dama at greater than the 5@xmath2 level . even in these cases ,",
    "the difference lies only at wimp masses below 4  gev and at relatively high si cross - sections . as channeling",
    "is a negligible effect , we do not further include it .    compared to our previous analysis in  @xcite ,",
    "the current study takes advantage of additional recently released dama data .",
    "the effect of the additional data has been to sharpen the regions in parameter space that match the data .",
    "for example , at @xmath25 , there are now two completely separate regions ( peaked at different wimp masses ) that were previously joined . in our current work",
    "we also display a @xmath26 contour in which the two regions are again connected .",
    "we remind the reader that we are using the goodness - of - fit statistic described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    ". the ( filled ) pink contour corresponds to the 7 - 12  gev wimp mass region suggested by cogent ( we reiterate that we have not reanalyzed their data and simply display their published region here ) .",
    "cdms , dama ( total events ) , xenon10 , and xenon100 curves indicate regions for which the wimp parameters are excluded at the 90% level ( the parameters above these curves are excluded )",
    ". the solid green region for xenon10 and solid purple region for xenon100 do _ not _ indicate regions compatible within a given level ( as opposed to the dama and cogent regions ) ; they instead indicate how the 90% exclusion constraints vary with the 1@xmath2 level uncertainties in the @xmath1  measurements .",
    "overlapping xenon10 and xenon100 1@xmath2 regions are shown in blue .",
    "for the fiducial ( central value ) @xmath1  model in the case where it is constant below 3.9  kevnr , shown in figure  [ fig : constantleff ] , the xenon100 constraint excludes all of the dama 3@xmath2 region , but only the portion of the cogent region with wimp masses above 9  gev .",
    "we note that , because we use only the manzur _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xmath1  data @xcite , this constraint is weaker than that presented by xenon100 @xcite .",
    "if the 1@xmath2 uncertainties in @xmath1  are included , xenon100 could exclude nearly all of the dama 5@xmath2 region and the entire cogent region , if the largest value of @xmath1  in the 1@xmath2 region is taken . on the other hand",
    ", it might exclude only the cogent region above 11  gev and not even all of the dama 90% region , if the lowest value of @xmath1  in the 1@xmath2 region is used .",
    "however , the cdms constraint , unaffected by the issues with @xmath1 , constrains the same cogent region as the fiducial xenon100 case here , with a slighter weaker constraint on the dama region ( incompatible with the dama 2@xmath2 region , not shown ) .",
    "for the fiducial ( central value ) @xmath1  model in the case where it falls linearly to zero at zero recoil energy , shown in figure  [ fig : fallingleff ] , the xenon100 constraint again excludes nearly all of the dama 3@xmath2 region and the portion of the cogent region with wimp masses above 9  gev .",
    "the 1@xmath2 variations in the @xmath1  measurements also yield a similar variation in the xenon100 constraint as they did in the constant @xmath1  case .",
    "the most extreme case , taking @xmath1  to be zero below 3.9  kevnr , yields similar xenon100 constraints as the other two cases , as seen in figure  [ fig : zeroleff ] , although the constraint using the 1@xmath2 upper values of @xmath1   does not quite exclude the full cogent region , leaving a narrow window at wimp masses of 7 - 8  gev .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that the linearly falling @xmath1  case is already conservative and taking @xmath1  to be zero below 3.9  kevnr is perhaps unrealistically conservative .",
    "the xenon100 constraints are nearly identical in the dama and cogent regions for all three cases of low energy @xmath1  behavior . in fact , the constraints based on the central and 1@xmath2 lower values of @xmath1  _ are _ identical ; only when using the upper 1@xmath2 @xmath1  values do the constraints differ .",
    "there are two main reasons for the similarity among the constraints : ( 1 ) the imposed @xmath9  pe cutoff and ( 2 ) the small potential contribution from recoil events with energies below 3.9  kevnr where the @xmath1  models differ .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : s1enr ] , a recoil energy of 3.9  kevnr yields an average @xmath4  signal of 1.0  pe in xenon100 when using any of the three fiducial @xmath1  models . with the @xmath8  cutoff",
    ", there is no contribution from recoils at energies below 3.9  kevnr where the fiducial @xmath1  models differ ; thus , these constraints are identical . when using the 1@xmath2 lower values of @xmath1 , no recoils below 5.9  kevnr",
    "are included , so the lesser constraining portion of the 1@xmath2 xenon100 constraint bands shown in the figures are likewise identical . on the other hand , when using the 1@xmath2 upper values of @xmath1 , the @xmath9  pe cutoff corresponds to recoil energies of 2.5 , 3.1 , and 3.9  kevnr for the constant , linearly falling , and zero low energy @xmath1  models , respectively . in this case ,",
    "low energy recoils contribute to the constraints .",
    "however , these low energy recoils can make only a small contribution to the observed signal , as will be discussed below .    as the potential effect of the low energy @xmath1  behavior on the xenon100 constraints",
    "is masked by the @xmath9  pe cutoff , we show in figure  [ fig : extended ] the xenon100 constraints for the three fiducial @xmath1  models when this cutoff is relaxed . in this figure",
    ", we have arbitrarily assumed the nuclear recoil band cut efficiency is constant at low recoil energies . in reality , this efficiency should fall at very low recoil energies and this approximation becomes inappropriate at recoil energies that yield @xmath8  somewhere below 1  pe .",
    "for this reason , these constraints should not be taken to be valid constraints ; we show them only to illustrate the potential effect of low energy recoils and the low energy @xmath1  behavior . with all cut efficiencies properly taken into account , the true constraints would lie somewhere between the constraints shown in this figure and those shown in the previous figures .    with the relaxing of the @xmath8  cutoff , the xenon100 constraints are still nearly identical in the dama and cogent regions for all three cases of low energy @xmath1  behavior .",
    "these constraints are very similar to the ones found in the previous figures , when a @xmath8   cutoff was included , and are actually identical for the zero @xmath1   model as this model has no contributions from recoils with @xmath27  pe anyways .",
    "the three cases only begin to differ significantly in the low mass , high cross - section parameter space located around and above the dama regions in this figure .",
    "this can be explained by the xenon100 s1 analysis threshold of 4  pe s ( the full analysis range is 4 - 20  pe s ) . in the absence of a finite energy resolution , this corresponds to a nuclear recoil energy of 9.5  kevnr in our fiducial @xmath1  models , well into the energy range where the @xmath1  behavior is known . with a poisson fluctuation in the number of observed pe s , recoils at lower energies have a finite chance of producing 4 or more pe s and falling into the analysis range , even if the average number of pe s for events at those energies is below 4 .",
    "however , at 3.9  kevnr , the average expected number of pe s is 1.0 ; only 1.9% of such events yield 4 or more pe s .",
    "recoils of 3  kevnr yield an average number of expected pe s of 0.79 and 0.61 for the constant and falling @xmath1  cases , respectively , with corresponding probabilities of being observed ( 4 + pe s ) of 0.87% and 0.36% ( the third case , zero @xmath1 , produces no pe s at these energies ) .",
    "the small fraction of recoil events with energies below 3.9  kevnr that will be observed in the analysis range means that their contribution is only significant when there are essentially no events at higher energies ( due to low wimp masses and a finite escape velocity in the halo ) , but to produce a sufficient number of events to fall into the analysis range requires a very large number of wimp scatters in the @xmath01 - 4  kevnr range , which requires a high wimp cross - section .",
    "thus , even when using an overly optimistic nuclear recoil band efficiency , the three @xmath1  cases can only result in different constraints in the low mass , high cross - section region .",
    "this is not necessarily the case for @xmath1  curves based on measurements that yield values higher than manzur _",
    "et  al . _",
    ", as this would push the analysis range corresponding to 4 - 20  pe s to lower recoil energies ; such cases , however , inevitably move the xenon100 constraints to the left . in any case ,",
    "the most significant issue in the xenon100 analysis is the choice of @xmath1  measurements used to determine the @xmath1  dependence , not the @xmath1  behavior at low energies .",
    "we now turn to the xenon10 bounds .",
    "we have reanalyzed the xenon10 results in terms of the same @xmath1  models as used for xenon100 and discussed in the previous section ; our results differ from those shown by the xenon collaboration due to the difference in @xmath1   used in their analyses and ours .",
    "the xenon10 results are important because of the lower @xmath4  threshold of about 2  pe s used in that analysis , which corresponds to 4.6  kevnr nuclear recoil energies in our fiducial @xmath1  models ( neglecting poisson fluctuations ) , much lower than the 9.5  kevnr of the xenon100 4  pe threshold . because of the lower threshold , the behavior of @xmath1  at low recoil energies is relevant in producing the xenon10 constraints as poisson fluctuations allow for a non - trivial probability of seeing 2 +  pe s for recoil energies below 3.9  kevnr .    for the constant @xmath1  case shown in figure  [ fig : constantleff ]",
    ", the lower threshold allows for a stronger sensitivity to lower wimp masses for xenon10 relative to xenon100 .",
    "the fiducial case excludes at the 90% c.l .",
    "all of the cogent region and dama to the 5@xmath2 contour .",
    "when the 1@xmath2 uncertainties in the @xmath1  measurements are taken into account , the constraints relax : dama is excluded to only the 3@xmath2 contour and the some of cogent region at wimp masses below 9  gev survive .",
    "the xenon10 constraints mildly weaken if @xmath1  is taken to fall linearly to zero below 3.9  kevnr , as seen in figure  [ fig : fallingleff ] .",
    "the fiducial case still excludes all of the cogent region and dama to about the 4@xmath2 contour ( not shown ) .",
    "the @xmath1  1@xmath2 band here allows the same dama and cogent regions to survive as with the constant @xmath1  case . for the case where @xmath1  is zero below 3.9  kevnr , shown in figure  [ fig : zeroleff ] , the xenon10 constraints further weaken and approach the xenon100 constraints as the low energy events are essentially turned off and the lower xenon10 threshold becomes less relevant .",
    "again , we note that this last case ( zero @xmath1  at low recoil energies ) is an extremely conservative case .    as with xenon100 , the potential effect of the low energy @xmath1   behavior on the xenon10 constraints",
    "is limited by the imposed @xmath9  pe cutoff .",
    "we also show in figure  [ fig : extended ] the xenon10 constraints for the three fiducial @xmath1  models when this cutoff is relaxed .",
    "the same caveats apply : the nuclear recoil band cut efficiency that is used is not appropriate for the full recoil energy range that it is applied over , so these do not represent valid constraints .",
    "again , these constraints are only used to illustrate the potential impact of the low energy @xmath1  behavior on xenon10 constraints .",
    "the actual constraints when all efficiencies are accounted for properly would fall somewhere between the constraints shown in figure  [ fig : extended ] and those shown in figs .",
    "( [ fig : constantleff])-([fig : zeroleff ] ) .    with the @xmath8  cutoff relaxed",
    ", figure  [ fig : extended ] shows how the low threshold allows for a strong xenon10 sensitivity to lower wimp masses .",
    "this is particularly evident with the constant @xmath1  case where , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : s1enr ] , recoils of energy 1  kevnr yield an average @xmath4  signal of 0.4  pe ; @xmath06% of such recoils will produce the necessary 2 +  pe . for the falling @xmath1  case ,",
    "that same average @xmath4  signal of 0.4  pe occurs at a higher recoil energy of 2  kevnr , but this energy is still sufficiently low to provide sensitivity to low mass wimps .",
    "the presence of these non - trivial poisson fluctuations at low recoil energies leads to a very strong dependence of the xenon10 constraints on the low energy @xmath1  behavior .",
    "this should remain the case even when the various efficiencies are handled properly , though not quite to the degree shown in figure  [ fig : extended ] .",
    "in particular , when the proper efficiencies are included , the xenon10 constraints in the constant and falling @xmath1  cases should gain an upward curve at low wimp masses , as seen with the other constraints , rather than the current linear appearance .",
    "these linear portions of the constraints at low wimp masses ( as they appear with the logarithmic scaling of the figure ) continue to arbitrarily low wimp masses ; however , they arise from the poisson tails of increasingly smaller energy events that would be suppressed when using the proper efficiencies .    though we have not included it in this work",
    ", cdms silicon data may provide further constraints on the dama and cogent regions and should be considered in a full discussion of compatibility between the various experimental results .",
    "the cdms silicon results will be considered in future work .    in summary , we have examined a number of subtleties relevant to direct detection studies of low mass wimps . in the interest of examining the most conservative xenon constraints ,",
    "we have used the manzur _",

    "of the existing data sets , the manzur _",

    "measurements , the behavior of @xmath1  at low energies ( less than 3.9  kevnr ) has negligible effect on the xenon100 constraints in the regions of interest for dama and/or cogent . for xenon100 ,",

    "however , this leads to only a moderate weakening of the xenon constraints by shifting the bound on the cross section upward by less than a factor of two .",
    "it is important to point out that including this effect does not weaken the constraints upwards in cross - section by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude , contrary to the claim in the critique given in ref .",
    "one can understand the small magnitude of the effect with the following reasoning .    a valid signal event in the xenon detectors is required to produce coincident scintillation in at least two pmts .",
    "the @xmath6  factor accounts for experimental limitations in identifying and reconstructing at least two pmt contributions to the overall @xmath4  signal of a recoil event .",
    "the @xmath4  signal is determined from the area under the peaks produced in the electronic readout of the pmts .",

    ".    the significance of the @xmath6  factor on xenon10 constraints can be easily estimated . if this factor is conservatively assumed to be 60% over the entire @xmath4  analysis range ( 2 +  pe ) instead of just at low @xmath4 , the expected number of events passing the xenon10 cuts at all energies should fall to 60% of the number of events expected without @xmath6  applied .",
    "as the recoil rate at a particular wimp mass is proportional to the scattering cross - section , the original recoil spectrum can be exactly reproduced by shifting the cross - section upwards by a factor of @xmath30 .",
    "thus , if a wimp mass and cross - section is excluded by xenon10 at some given cl without the @xmath6  factor applied , a wimp with the same mass and @xmath111.7 higher cross - section would yield the same excluded spectrum with the @xmath6  factor included . in this case",

    "@xmath6   is higher than 60% for @xmath4  larger than 2  pe , the shift in cross - section will be even smaller at heavier wimps where a significant number of high @xmath4  events are expected .",

    "several sources of error may contribute to the level of uncertainty in these @xmath1  estimates .",

    ", the @xmath49 grows rapidly for this reason : it is difficult to account for this @xmath0700 scintillation event peak if the nuclear recoils produce little to no scintillation . note the systematic issues discussed in manzur _",
    "_  generally affect the interpretation of which @xmath1   would produce such a peak , but do not provide significant alternate mechanisms for producing such a peak aside from the scintillation from low energy recoils ( scintillation that can only be produced if @xmath52 ) .",
    "thus , while determining the value of @xmath1  based on the size and shape of such @xmath4  peaks may be limited by statistics or biased by systematic effects , the simple presence of such a peak is strong evidence that @xmath1  is non - zero .    given that manzur _",
