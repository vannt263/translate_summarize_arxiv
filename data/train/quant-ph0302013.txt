    "in this letter we consider the following two questions : + 1 ) can information be carried by a superfluid order parameter @xmath0 in the same way that information is carried by , say , a radio wave ? + and + 2 ) since the superfluid order parameter @xmath0 depends on entanglement _ a la _ bogoluibov , is there any difference between information carried by a superfluid order parameter and quantum information ? + the answer to the first question is pretty clearly yes , but the answer to the second is not so obvious .",
    "it was shown by bogoluibov @xcite that superfluids depend on existence of epr - like correlations between particles of opposite momenta .",
    "since epr correlations play an important role in quantum computing @xcite , one might conjecture that spatial variations in the order parameter qualify as `` quantum informations '' .",
    "+ as was first pointed out by planck @xcite , the clausius - boltzmann entropy of any classical system obeying a principle of least action is zero .",
    "this serves as a hint that in a search of the answer to the second question one should turn to the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics where the principle of least action is not valid anymore .",
    "one feature of the path integral formulation which can serve our purposes is an existence of quantum - mechanical paths @xcite that are continuous but non - differentiable everywhere .",
    "+ therefore a transition to a classical regime is characterized by smoothing out the `` irregularities '' of a quantum - mechanical path .",
    "this smoothing was ascribed to the process of averaging `` over a reasonable length of time to produce ... an average velocity '' @xcite .",
    "in fact , the emergence of a classical path is due to a decreased resolution used in measuring the path s length .",
    "+ this is clearly seen if one would use for the description of a quantum - mechanical path the concept of hausdorff length and dimension @xcite .",
    "it was found that independently of the length definition , the hausdorff dimension of a quantum - mechanical path is @xmath1 as compared to the classical dimension @xmath2 . the transition from one regime to another",
    "can be demonstrated by explicitly evaluating the hausdorff length in @xcite for any value of the hausdorff dimension .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the average distance a particle travels in a time @xmath5 , its path length is @xmath6\\}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the spatial resolution , @xmath10 is the de broglie wavelength and @xmath11 is particle s average momentum .",

    "that we made full circle on a spiral , referring to the earlier view of quantum mechanics , but this time on a higher level .",
    "roughly speaking , the magnitude of this parameter indicates how strong(weak ) are quantum effects as viewed from the classical world .",
    "as will be seen below , this parameter has a universal character , and it will emerge in our discussion of the",
    "to illustrate this point we consider a bose condensate of interacting bosons at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "small perturbations to the superfluid order parameter satisfy the linear schroedinger - like equation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the speed of sound and @xmath18 is the mass of the fluid . + we will consider the classical- quantum transition with the help of @xmath19 methods which , as will be seen later , turn out to be equivalent : + * i ) numerical calculation * in this approach the average distance @xmath4 the particle travels in time @xmath5 can be written as follows : @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 is given in @xcite as @xmath23 by introducing the dimensionless quantities @xmath24 and using ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) we rewrite the expression ( [ eq:5 ] ) : @xmath25 interestingly enough , the dimensionless quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 have a very simple physical meaning : @xmath27 is the ratio of the classical and quantum momenta ( here the classical quantity appears naturally and not introduced by hand as in @xcite ) and @xmath26 is the ratio of the respective energies .",
    "+ if we take the function @xmath28 to be gaussian , that is @xmath29 then ( [ eq:8 ] ) yields the following hausdorff length @xmath30 @xmath31 + in 2 limiting cases of + 1 ) a purely classical regime ( @xmath32 ) and 2 ) a purely quantum regime ( @xmath33 ) + the above expression can be evaluated analytically . for simplicity sake ( and without any loss of generality ) we consider a 1-d realization of ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "+ @xmath34 ) after some algebra , the first case yields the following expression for the hausdorff length @xmath30 : @xmath35 where we denote @xmath36 the result is rather trivial , since in this case in the limit of @xmath37 the hausdorff length is the conventional length , whose dimension is @xmath38 .",
    "+ @xmath39 quite analogously we find that in this case the hausdorff length is @xmath40 in the limit @xmath41 eq.([eq:11 ] ) yields @xmath42 which is the same result as was obtained for quantum case in @xcite . +     , resolution @xmath43 and sound speed @xmath44(bottom to top),width=226,height=226 ]     + in general , the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) can not be found in a closed form .",
    "instead we evaluate them numerically .",
    "the result is shown in fig.@xmath45 where the hausdorff length is presented as a function of the hausdorff dimension @xmath46 , resolution @xmath9 and the following values of sound speed @xmath47 + * ii)heuristic(de broglie ) construction * + to compare the results of the previous section with the calculations based on an heuristic ( de broglie ) picture , we begin with the dispersion relation which follows from ( [ eq:4 ] ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49@xmath50 and @xmath50 is the wave length of the small perturbations which we take as the probing length scale , that is @xmath51 .",
    "+ in the de broglie picture the group velocity is considered as a velocity of a quantum `` particle '' which in turn would allow us to introduce an analogue of the path length @xmath30 travelled by such a particle in a time @xmath52 . moreover , since we are dealing with the quantum path , this path length must be understood in hausdorff sense : @xmath53    from ( [ eq:13 ] ) we find the group ( particle ) velocity @xmath54 @xmath55 + the path length @xmath56 ( in its conventional sense ) travelled by this particle in a time interval @xmath52 is then @xmath57 we notice that in this case the dimensionless quantity @xmath58 emerges which is exactly the same as in the previous ( numerical ) case ( cf .",
    "eq.[eq : a ] ) . as a result",
    "we obtain from ( [ eq:15 ] ) the following expression for the hausdorff length @xmath59 : @xmath60 from eq.([eq:16 ] ) follows that for the limiting case of @xmath61 ( that is purely quantum case ) the hausdorff dimension is @xmath62 . on the other hand , for another limiting case of @xmath63 , that is @xmath64",
    "the hausdorff dimension is @xmath65 corresponding to the classical limit .",
    "+ the graph of the general dependence @xmath66 according to eq.([eq:16 ] ) , that is according to de broglie picture , is shown in fig.4 .     ,",
    "@xmath43 and sound speed @xmath44(bottom to top ) according to the de broglie picture , width=226,height=226 ]    a comparison of figs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) shows a remarkable qualitative similarity between the hausdorff length @xmath59 calculated on the basis of the de broglie picture and the same length found with the help of the numerical analysis .",
    "however , this should not be very surprising , if we take into account that the integrand in eq.([eq:9 ] ) contains as a power of the exponent the dispersion relation ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "it is seen ( both from eq.[eq:16 ] and figs.@xmath45 and @xmath67 ) that the transition from quantum to classical regime ( characterized by a change of hausdorff dimension ) is a continuous process , such that a change from a classical to quantum regime is governed by the dimensionless parameter ( dimensionless length ) @xmath68 eq.[eq : b ] ) whose physical meaning was given earlier as the ratio of the quantum `` momentum '' ( in the de broglie sense ) and the classical momentum of a particle moving with the speed of sound .",
    "a gradual increase of @xmath69 signals a continuous transition from a purely classical ( @xmath70 ) to purely quantum ( @xmath71 ) regime .",
    "the emerging picture allows us to answer the second question posed at the beginning of this letter . for small perturbations",
    "a superfluid order parameter @xmath0 is a function of the parameter @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "a continuous change of this parameter from @xmath72 to @xmath71 describes a transition from the classical regime in a superfluid to the quantum regime .",
    "therefore in the limit @xmath41 there is no difference between the information carried by the superfluid order parameter and the quantum information .",
    "+ amazingly enough , the above process describes a continuous transition from a fluid - like coherent state to a coherent state of weakly interacting particles . for ordinary sound velocities",
    "this transition occurs for microscopic probing length scales .",
    "however , if we are near a quantum critical point where @xmath73 , then this transition will occur for macroscopic length scales .",
    "+ our results run contrary to the conventional point of view regarding the transition from classical to quantum physics as being necessarily due to decoherence @xcite .",
    "indeed , in our view decoherence plays essentially no role in the transition from ordinary classical physics to quantum physics . to the contrary",
    "our results strongly support the view @xcite that the validity of classical equations of motion for macroscopic length scales is a consequence of having a vacuum state with a stiff order parameter .",
    "in fact , identifying ordinary spacetime with a superfluid - like quantum state with a small value of @xmath74 would be a natural result in almost any physically reasonable quantum theory of gravity @xcite",
    "the authors would like to thank v.panico for his valuable help in preparation of this paper .",
    "after completion of this paper we became aware of a recent paper by y. shi @xcite , that also shows that the transition from quantum to classical behavior in a superfluid is not due to decoherence , but using rather different arguments .",
