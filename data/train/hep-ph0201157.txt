    "the new brookhaven experimental result for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xcite aroused considerable interest in the physics community , because it was interpreted as indicating a new physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "however , such claims , too premature in our opinion , assume that the theoretical prediction for the muon anomaly is well understood at the level of necessary precision .",
    "hadronic uncertainties become of main concern @xcite .",
    "fortunately the leading hadronic contribution is related to the hadronic corrections to the photon vacuum polarization function , which can be accurately calculated provided that the precise experimental data on the low - energy hadronic cross sections in the @xmath4 annihilation are at our disposal .    in the last few years high - statistics",
    "experimental data were collected in the @xmath1-@xmath2 region in novosibirsk experiments at the vepp-2 m collider @xcite . in this region",
    "the hadronic cross sections are dominated by the @xmath5 and @xmath6 channels .",
    "the former is of uppermost importance for reduction of errors in the evaluation of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon g-2 .",
    "considerable progress was reported for this channel by the cmd-2 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 channel , which gives a less important but still significant contribution to the hadronic error , was also investigated in the same experiment in the @xmath2-meson region @xcite .",
    "such high precision experiments require accurate knowledge of various backgrounds . among them",
    "the @xmath7 channel provides an important background needed to be well understood .",
    "this experimental necessity motivated our investigation of the three pion radiative production presented here . besides",
    ", being of interest as an important background source , this process could be of interest by itself , because a detailed experimental study of the final state radiation will allow one to get important information about pion - photon dynamics at low energies .",
    "however , such an experimental investigation will require much more statistics than available in vepp-2 m experiments and maybe would be feasible only at @xmath8-factories where the low energy region can be reached by radiative return technique as was recently been demonstrated in the kloe experiment @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 be the matrix element of the electromagnetic current between the vacuum and the @xmath10 final state .",
    "then the initial state radiation ( isr ) contribution to the @xmath11 process cross section is given at @xmath12 by the standard expression @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for the lorentz invariant phase space @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the photon virtuality , @xmath17 being the beam energy and @xmath2  the energy of the @xmath18 quantum .",
    "particle 4-momenta assignment can be read from the corresponding diagrams presented in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the current matrix element @xmath9 has a general form @xmath19 for the @xmath20 form - factor , which depends only on invariants constructed from the pions 4-momenta , we will take the expression from @xcite @xmath21 \\left ( 1 - 3\\alpha_k-\\alpha_k h \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq3}\\ ] ] here @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the pion decay constant , @xmath24 characterizes the departure of the @xmath2-@xmath8 mixing from the ideal one , and @xmath25 where @xmath26 the dimensionless breit - wigner factors have the form @xmath27^{-1 } , \\;\\ ; r_\\rho(q^2)=\\left [ \\frac{q^2}{m_\\rho^2}-1 + i\\frac{\\sqrt{q^2}\\gamma_\\rho(q^2)}{m_\\rho^2}\\right ] ^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and for the @xmath1 meson the energy dependent width is used @xmath29 the last term in ( [ eq1 ] ) is completely irrelevant for vepp-2 m energies if the hard photon is emitted at a large angle .",
    "so we will neglect it in the following .",
    "to describe final state radiation ( fsr ) , we use the effective low - energy wess - zumino - witten lagrangian @xcite . the relevant piece of this lagrangian is reproduced below @xmath30- \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-9.2 mm } \\left .",

    ", one can calculate the @xmath39 amplitude originated from the diagrams shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the result is @xmath40 where ( @xmath41 is the virtual photon 4-momentum ) @xmath42 the tensor @xmath43 is gauge invariant @xmath44    note that our result for @xmath45 is in agreement with the known result @xcite for the @xmath46 amplitude ( these two amplitudes are connected by crossing symmetry , of course ) .",
    "if @xmath47 is the amplitude of the transition @xmath48 , then the final state radiation ( fsr ) contribution to the @xmath49 process cross section is given by @xcite @xmath50 @xmath51 and the@xmath52 axis was assumed to be along @xmath53 , but @xmath54 .",
    "so we can perform the polarization sum by using @xmath55 . by introducing gauge invariant real 4-vectors @xmath56 and @xmath57 via @xmath58",
    ", the result can be casted in the form ( note that the norm of the gauge invariant 4-vector is always negative ) @xmath59~d\\phi . \\label{eq7}\\ ] ] however , for the photon virtualities of real experimental interest vector meson effects can no longer be neglected .",
    "so we replace ( [ eq7 ] ) by @xmath59~k_{bw } ~d\\phi\\equiv\\ ] ] @xmath60 where we have introduced the phenomenological breit - wigner factor @xmath61 this factor is similar to one presented in isr ( see ( [ eq3 ] ) ) and tends to unity as @xmath62 .",
    "it gives about an order of magnitude increase in @xmath63 for energies @xmath64 .",
    "although what follows can be considered as a textbook material @xcite , we will nevertheless give a somewhat detailed description of the monte carlo algorithm for the sake of convenience .",
    "the important first step is the following transformation of the lorentz invariant phase space .",
    "let @xmath65 be @xmath66-particle phase space @xmath67 inserting the identity @xmath68 we get @xmath69 @xmath70 however , ( note that @xmath71 ) @xmath72 therefore , @xmath73 but @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 stands for the triangle function and @xmath76 describes the orientation of the @xmath77 vector in the @xmath78-particle rest frame .    it is more convenient to integrate over @xmath79-particle energy @xmath80 instead of mass @xmath81 , the two being interconnected by the relation @xmath82 in the @xmath78-particle rest frame .",
    "using the relation @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the @xmath18-factor of the `` particle '' ( subsystem ) with the invariant mass @xmath81 , after repeatedly using ( [ eq9 ] ) we get @xmath85 where @xmath86 momentum is in the rest frame of the ( 3,4 ) subsystem , and @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 are in the rest frame of the ( 2,3,4 ) subsystem .",
    "now it is straightforward to rewrite the differential cross - section in the following form : @xmath90 where @xmath91 ( we do not take into account the interference between the initial and final state radiations",
    ". this interference integrates to zero if we do not distinguish between negative and positive @xmath3-mesons ) , @xmath92 and @xmath93 the upper and lower limits for energies are @xmath94 the minimal photon energy @xmath95 is an external experimental cut . at last ,",
    "@xmath96 and @xmath97 can be read from the corresponding expressions ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) , respectively .    according to ( [ eq10 ] )",

    "@xmath98 if @xmath140 , accept the event that is the generated 4-momenta of the @xmath141 and @xmath112 mesons and the photon .",
    "otherwise repeat the whole procedure .",
    "we assume that the photon in the @xmath7 reaction is hard enough @xmath142 and radiated at large angle @xmath143 so that it could be detected by experimental equipment ( a detector ) . in any process with accelerated charged particles soft photons",
    "are emitted without being detected because a detector has finite energy resolution .",
    "even moderately hard photons can escape detection in some circumstances .",
    "how important are such effects ?",
    "naively every photon emitted brings extra factor @xmath144 in the amplitude and so a small correction is expected . but this argument ( as well as the perturbation theory ) breaks down for soft photons . when an electron ( positron ) emits a soft enough photon , it nearly remains on the mass shell , thus bringing a very large propagator in the amplitude .",
    "formal application of the perturbation theory gives an infinite answer to the correction due to soft photon emission because of this pole singularity .",
    "it is well known @xcite how to deal with this infrared divergence . in real experiments",
    "very low energy photons never have enough time and space to be formed , because of a finite size of the laboratory .",
    "so we have a natural low energy cut - off . a remarkable fact",
    ", however , is that the observable cross sections do not depend on the actual form of the cut - off because singularities due to real and virtual soft photons cancel each other @xcite .",
    "the net effect is that the soft photon corrections , summed to all orders of perturbation theory , factor out as some calculable , so called yennie - frautschi - suura exponent @xcite .",
    "collinear radiation of ( not necessarily soft ) photons by highly relativistic initial electrons ( positrons ) is another source of big corrections which should also be treated non - perturbatively . unlike soft photons",
    ", however , the matrix element for a radiation of an arbitrary number of collinear photons is unknown .",
    "nevertheless , there is a nice method ( the so called structure functions method ) @xcite which enables one to sum leading collinear ( and soft ) logarithms .",
    "the corrected cross - section , when radiation of unnoticed photons with total energy less than @xmath145 is allowed , looks like @xcite @xmath146 , \\label{eq13}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 and we have omitted some higher order terms .    in our case the hard photon is well separated ( because of @xmath148 cuts ) from the soft and collinear regions of the phase space .",
    "so equation ( [ eq13 ] ) is applicable and it indicates that the soft and collinear corrections to the cross - section of the process @xmath7 do not exceed 20% when @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "such corrections are irrelevant for the present vepp-2 m statistics but may become important in future high statistics experiments .",
    "in fig.[fig4 ] , numerical results are shown for @xmath151 with @xmath152 . as expected , the cross section is small , only few picobarns , for energies @xmath153 .",
    "this figure shows also that fsr contributes significantly at such low energies .",
    "so if future @xmath8-factory experiments produce high enough statistics in this energy region , the study of fsr will become realistic .",
    "fsr and isr give different angular and energy distributions for the photon as illustrated by fig.[fig5 ] and fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "this fact can be used for the fsr separation from a somewhat more intensive isr .",
    "let us note , however , that the model considered here is not valid in the @xmath8-meson region  very far from the threshold .",
    "at that the status of uncertainties in the isr and fsr contributions are different .",
    "we believe that the isr amplitude remains accurate enough even in the @xmath8-meson region .",
    "this belief stems from the fact that all relevant vector meson effects are already included in the isr amplitude ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the situation with the fsr amplitude is different .",
    "our phenomenological breit - wigner factor mimics only some part of the vector meson effects . to estimate the corresponding uncertainty in @xmath63 ,",
    "let us try some other choices for @xmath154 which also have the correct low energy limit .",
    "if in the expression for the @xmath154 factor we make the change @xmath155,\\ ] ] @xmath63 will be lowered by @xmath156 for @xmath157 , and by @xmath158 for @xmath159 . in the fsr amplitude",
    "the @xmath1-meson contributes via a number of various diagrams .",
    "for example , the @xmath160 intermediate state , which has no counterpart in the @xmath2 meson contribution , gives the following piece of the @xmath43 tensor @xmath161 where @xmath162 @xmath163,\\ ] ] @xmath164,\\ ] ] @xmath165,\\ ] ] and @xmath166 \\left [ ( q_\\pm+q_0)^2-m_\\rho^2\\right ] } .\\ ] ] if we include this contribution , and besides ensure that the remaining part of the fsr amplitude ( [ eq6 ] ) also takes @xmath167 in the role of the phenomenological breit - wigner factor , the fsr cross section will be lowered by @xmath168 for @xmath169 , and by @xmath170 for @xmath159 .",
    "this uncertainty in the fsr magnitude is irrelevant for the present vepp-2 m statistics . for future high precision experiments a systematic inclusion of all relevant vector meson effects in the fsr amplitude",
    "is desired .",
