    "two decades after the discovery of the integral and fractional quantum hall effects ( iqhe and fqhe ) , two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems in a perpendicular magnetic field remain a field of research with unforeseen and surprising phenomena.@xcite experimental findings range from the observation of large anisotropies in the longitudinal magneto - resistance@xcite to an intriguing reentrant iqhe ( riqhe ) at moderate magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite from a theoretical point of view , these systems are particularly interesting because they exhibit a large variety of quantum phases ranging from quantum liquids responsible for the fqhe to electron - solid phases such as the wigner crystal and charge density waves ( cdws ) .",
    "these quantum phases arise because in the presence of a magnetic field the electrons kinetic energy is quantized in equidistant energy levels , which are called landau levels ( lls ) .",
    "the separation between these highly degenerate levels is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the cyclotron frequency for electrons with charge @xmath8 and band mass @xmath9 .",
    "the level degeneracy is characterized by the ll filling factor @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the planar electronic density and @xmath12 is the flux density , with the magnetic length @xmath13 .",
    "the flux density determines the density of states per ll .",
    "furthermore , each ll is split into two spin branches with an energy gap @xmath14 because of the zeeman effect .",
    "correlation effects due to the coulomb interaction between the electrons become important if @xmath15 , with integral @xmath16 , and if the characteristic coulomb energy @xmath17 is smaller than the level separations @xmath6 and @xmath14 , which is the case at large magnetic fields .    in the two lowest lls ,",
    "strong correlations give rise to quantum - liquid phases , which display the fqhe at @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are integers and @xmath20 is the filling factor of the last , partially filled spin branch of the @xmath21-th ll .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the number of completely filled levels , which may be treated as inert , and obeys @xmath22 for a partially filled lower spin branch and @xmath23 for the upper spin branch of the @xmath21-th ll .",
    "the fqhe is understood in terms of composite fermions ( cfs),@xcite which are formed to reduce the repulsive coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "this reduction is due to a factor @xmath24 in the @xmath16-particle wave function , where @xmath25 is the position of the @xmath26-th particle in the complex plane .",
    "furthermore , these cfs experience a reduced coupling @xmath27 to the external magnetic field , and thus fill cf - lls with a filling factor @xmath28 as do electrons in the case of the iqhe . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the cf wave functions coincide with laughlin s trial wave functions , which describe the fqhe at @xmath30.@xcite both the iqhe and the fqhe are usually explained by single - particle localization due to underlying impurities:@xcite if the filling factor is slightly increased from @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , _",
    "e.g. _ by lowering the magnetic field , electrons ( cfs ) are promoted to the next ( cf- ) ll .",
    "they first populate the minima of the underlying impurity potential and are thus localized so that they do not contribute to the electrical transport .",
    "the longitudinal and the hall resistances therefore remain at their original values .",
    "this gives rise to the plateaus in the hall resistance at values @xmath33 for the iqhe ( @xmath34 for the fqhe ) if plotted as a function of the magnetic field accompanied by zeros in the longitudinal magneto - resistance .",
    "however , the insulating behavior of electrons in the last ll may also be due to another effect than single - particle localization .",
    "because of their mutual coulomb repulsion , the electrons in the last ll have a tendency to form a wigner crystal at low @xmath2 . at larger values of @xmath2 ,",
    "hartree - fock calculations indicate that in higher lls these electrons may form cdws.@xcite there is since quite long experimental evidence for the formation of a wigner crystal in the lowest ll below @xmath35.@xcite recent microwave experiments revealed that the wigner - crystal phase around @xmath31 persists in higher lls@xcite and that a triangular cdw ( bubble ) ground state is formed around @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the @xmath38-ll.@xcite another experimental evidence for cdw formation in higher lls is the huge anisotropy observed in the longitudinal magneto - resistance at half - filling for @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite in this case , the bubbles merge to form a uni - directional cdw ( stripe phase ) .",
    "because the electronic transport is easy along the stripes ( low - resistance direction ) and strongly suppressed across them , this effect gives rise to the anisotropy .",
    "recent experimental investigations by eisenstein _",
    "_ in both spin branches of the @xmath4-ll have revealed a new intriguing phenomenon:@xcite between the fqhe states at @xmath40 and the even - denominator state@xcite at @xmath41 with a quantized @xmath42 , the hall resistance jumps back to values @xmath33 , corresponding to the neighboring plateau of the usual iqhe .",
    "an analogous reentrant iqhe ( riqhe ) had been observed before by cooper _",
    "et al . _ in @xmath38 around @xmath36 and @xmath37.@xcite as expected from the observation of the fqhe , which indicates the importance of strong correlations in this range of the filling factor , such insulating phases of electrons in the last ll are unlikely to be due to simple localization of single particles .",
    "in this article , we present detailed energy calculations of the different quantum - liquid and electron - solid phases in @xmath0 , and @xmath1 , which allow us to identify the electron - solid phase in form of a triangular cdw as the origin of this insulating behavior .",
    "the cdw is pinned by the underlying impurities and therefore does not contribute to the electrical transport@xcite .",
    "this leads to the same dc response in transport measurements as observed in the iqhe regime .",
    "however , in the vicinity of @xmath3 the quantum - liquid phases have a lower energy than the electron solid , provided that @xmath2 is lower than a critical filling @xmath43 , given as a function of the ll index @xmath21.@xcite this gives rise to the observed alternation between the different phases with first - order quantum phase transitions between them .",
    "the phases in @xmath4 and @xmath38 have already been discussed in a previous rapid communication.@xcite here , we provide more details of the calculations including stripe phases and results for @xmath44 .",
    "we further evaluate how pinning by impurities will affect the energy values of the electron - solid phases and discuss possible experimental consequences of our theoretical investigations .",
    "in sec.ii , we present a theoretical model for the description of electrons restricted to the @xmath21-th ll and its basic properties .",
    "the hartree - fock solutions of this model for triangular and uni - directional cdws are obtained in sec.iii .",
    "the energy of the quantum - liquid phases exactly at @xmath3 is calculated in sec.iv with the help of sum rules imposed on laughlin s trial wave functions.@xcite if the filling factor is moved away from precisely these values , quasiparticles/-holes are excited .",
    "their energies are calculated analytically in sec.v in the framework of the hamiltonian theory proposed recently by murthy and shankar.@xcite in sec.vi , a comparison of the energies of the different phases and the relation to experimental results are given .",
    "impurity effects are investigated in sec.vii , and possible experiments , which could verify our results , are discussed in sec.viii .",
    "a brief summary may be found in sec.ix .",
    "we adopt a model of spinless electrons and restrict their dynamics to the @xmath21-th ll .",
    "this model is valid when the characteristic coulomb - interaction energy @xmath17 is smaller than the ll separation @xmath6 and the zeeman splitting @xmath14 .",
    "we further require that the partial filling factor of the last level @xmath45 $ ] is different from zero because at integral fillings , the only possible low - energy excitations are inter - ll excitations , which cost an energy of order @xmath6 or @xmath46 . in the absence of inter - ll excitations ,",
    "the number of electrons @xmath47 in the last ll is fixed by the partial filling factor @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the total area of the sample .",
    "the kinetic energy is therefore an unimportant constant @xmath50 , which may be omitted in the hamiltonian .",
    "the model is thus given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the usual coulomb potential and the fermion fields contain only components of the @xmath21-th ll @xmath53 the wave functions in the landau gauge @xmath54 are given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 , and @xmath57 creates an electron in the state @xmath58 . in terms of fourier components of the density operator @xmath59 the hamiltonian can be rewritten in reciprocal space as @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "the projected density operator reads @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a laguerre polynomial .",
    "the form factor @xmath65 is due to the overlap of the wave functions in the @xmath21-th ll and has been absorbed in an effective interaction potential @xmath66 ^ 2 , \\qquad v(q)=2\\pi e^2/\\epsilon q.\\ ] ] inter - ll excitations may be accounted for in a wave - vector - dependent dielectric function @xmath67.@xcite this dependence will be neglected in the further discussion because it has only a minor effect on the physical properties of the system as shown by fogler and koulakov.@xcite    + 5.0 cm    with the help of the usual anti - commutation relations for the fermionic operators , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , one finds that the projected density operators satisfy the algebra@xcite @xmath70=2i\\sin\\left(\\frac{({{\\bf q}}\\times{{\\bf k}})_zl_b^2}{2}\\right){\\bar{\\rho}}({{\\bf q}}+{{\\bf k}}).\\ ] ] the physical origin of this algebra is the following : by projecting the density operators to the @xmath21-th ll , one averages over the rapid cyclotron motion so that @xmath71 may be interpreted as a density operator of fermions , which are described only by their guiding - center coordinates @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 being position and momentum of the @xmath75-th particle , respectively .",
    "it is the non - commutativity of the components of the guiding - center coordinates @xmath76=-il_b^2\\delta_{k , l}$ ] , which is responsible for these commutation relations as well as for the fact that each electronic state occupies a minimal surface @xmath77 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ equ001 ] ) together with the commutation relations ( [ equ003 ] ) define the quantum mechanical model .",
    "the electrons interact via the effective interaction potential ( [ equ002 ] ) , which contains the information of the ll of interest in the form factor @xmath65 . deeper insight into the meaning of this interaction potential",
    "is obtained from a transformation back to real space , which is shown in fig.[fig00 ] .",
    "the effective interaction potential satisfies the scaling law @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the cyclotron radius.@xcite with the help of @xmath80 , which becomes exact in the large-@xmath21 limit , one obtains @xmath81 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the zero - order bessel function and @xmath83 the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "comparison with the exact form of the real - space interaction potential ( fig.[fig00 ] ) indicates that the scaling form ( [ equ0 - 1 ] ) is accurate also in lower lls @xmath84 .",
    "note that this approximate expression is shown primarily for reasons of illustration here . in the calculations presented below",
    ", we use the exact form of the interaction potential , obtained by a fourier transformation of eq .",
    "( [ equ002 ] ) . apart from small oscillations around the approximate form ( black line in fig.[fig00 ] ) , the potential exhibits a plateau of width @xmath85 superimposed on the bare @xmath86 coulomb potential , which is retrieved at large distances . the plateau is due to the ring - like form of the electronic wave functions in the @xmath21-th ll with a radius on the order of @xmath87 .",
    "this model permits a common description of interacting electrons for all lls .",
    "the hamiltonian approach proposed by murthy and shankar@xcite is therefore not restricted to the lowest ll , but has universal validity , provided inter - ll mixing is negligible .    for the following sections , we will choose a system of units with @xmath88 to simplify the notation .",
    "whereas the quantum nature of the electron - liquid phases , which display the fqhe , is not captured in a mean - field treatment of the model , the hartree - fock approximation gives reliable estimates for the energy of states with a modulated electron density such as cdws .",
    "@xcite in this section , we follow the lines of refs .",
    "the hartree - fock hamiltonian turns out to be linear in the projected density operators @xmath89 @xmath90 with @xmath91 . a detailed derivation of eq .",
    "( [ equ004 ] ) is given in the appendix . because the effective interaction potential in the @xmath21-th ll @xmath92 is isotropic , the exchange potential is simply proportional to the real - space direct potential .",
    "for the intermediate lls @xmath0 , and @xmath1 , the fourier transformation may be calculated exactly without the help of the approximate scaling formula ( [ equ0 - 1 ] ) , which was used in a previous study .",

    "this phase has been proposed as a candidate for the ground state at @xmath100 in higher lls.@xcite clusters of @xmath101 electrons form a super wigner crystal to minimize the residual coulomb interaction , and because these @xmath101-electron bubbles may be treated as classical objects , one expects the cdw to have a triangular symmetry.@xcite the phase is described by a local guiding - center filling factor @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the radius of a @xmath101-electron bubble and @xmath104 are the lattice vectors of the 2d triangular lattice .",

    "may be obtained from a minimization of the energy density @xcite @xmath193 with respect to @xmath194 .",
    "this yields the larkin length @xmath195 and the cohesive energy of the bubble phase ( [ equ005 ] ) is thus lowered by the quantity @xmath196 the weak - pinning limit requires that @xmath194 be larger than the lattice constant @xmath106 , and the crossover to the strong - pinning regime may thus be characterized by the condition @xmath197 . for the @xmath152-electron bubble phase",
    "the strong - pinning case is equivalent to mere single - particle localization , and the energy gain per particle is simply given by @xmath198 .",
    "+ 5.0 cm    the results for the cohesive energy of the bubble phases in @xmath4 are shown in fig.[fig04 ] for two different values of the impurity strength @xmath199 in comparison to the pure case .",
    "one observes that bubble crystals with larger numbers @xmath101 of electrons per bubble are less affected by the impurity potential due to their higher stiffness .",
    "furthermore , the quantum - liquid phases cease to be the energetically favored states in the dilute limit with @xmath200 , and in agreement with experimental results,@xcite we find that the wigner crystal ( @xmath152-electron bubble phase ) is formed . the exact determination of this transition point , however , requires a detailed knowledge of the nature and the strength of the underlying impurity potential .",
    "in addition , correlation effects within the wigner - crystal phase which modify the energy curves should be taken into account , as pointed out in previous studies for the lowest ll .",
    "in this section , we propose some new experimental investigations , which could verify the presented theoretical results .",
    "the energy calculations indicate that the transitions between the quantum - liquid and electron - solid phases are first - order quantum phase transitions .",
    "one consequence of this result is that the phenomenon of `` super - cooling '' is expected with respect to the control parameter , which is the filling factor tuned by the magnetic field .",
    "starting a transport measurement _",
    "e.g. _ from the quantum - liquid phase at @xmath201 and then lowering the magnetic field , the phase transition to the bubble phase would take place at a lower magnetic field than for the inverse case in which one raises the field starting from the bubble phase .",
    "the observation of such a hysteretical behavior in the hall resistance may support the presence of first - order quantum phase transitions .",
    "another possible investigation of the bubble phase is via transport studies under microwave irradiation of the 2d electron system.@xcite due to the pinning of the bubble crystal by residual impurities , the longitudinal conductivity @xmath202 $ ] depends on the microwave frequency and exhibits a resonance at a finite value @xmath203 .",
    "the functional dependence of @xmath203 was recently calculated for the wigner crystal .",
    "@xcite these results may be generalized to the bubble phase if one replaces the elasticity constant @xmath192 and the larkin length @xmath194 of the wigner crystal by their values for the bubble phase derived in the preceding section .",
    "depending on the strength of the magnetic field , one finds for a classical bubble crystal @xmath204 and @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the characteristic self - energy of the phonons of the bubble crystal .",
    "the number of electrons per bubble may therefore in principle be determined from the resonance in the frequency - dependent conductivity at @xmath203 . because of the mixed phase with coexisting @xmath101- and @xmath207-bubbles , which is energetically favorable at certain filling factors , one expects to observe two peaks in @xmath202 $ ] whose respective weight varies with changing magnetic field .",
    "this effect may be easier to measure around quarter - filling of the @xmath44 than in @xmath38 because in this range of @xmath208 there is no competition with quantum - liquid or stripe phases .",
    "the resolution of such a double - peak structure , however , depends on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    recently , cot _ et al .",
    "_ argued that the first - order quantum phase transitions between bubble crystals of different @xmath101 would lead to experimentally observable discontinuities in the magnetic susceptibility @xmath209 associated to the orbital magnetization .",
    "@xcite it is , however , uncertain how these discontinuities will evolve if the sharp phase transition is covered by an energetically favored mixed phase of bubbles with different @xmath101 .",
    "we have presented detailed energy calculations of the competing quantum - liquid and electron - solid phases , which allow for the determination of the ground state in the intermediate lls @xmath0 , and @xmath1 as a function of the partial filling @xmath2 of the last ll . whereas the energies of the electron solids ( triangular and uni - directional cdws , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath101-electron bubbles and stripes ) , are calculated in the hartree - fock approximation , which gives reliable energy estimates for states with a modulated electron density,@xcite the quantum nature of the liquid phases is not captured in a mean - field treatment of the model .    at filling factors @xmath144",
    ", the quantum liquid may be described by laughlin s trial wave functions . with the help of a set of sum rules imposed on these wave functions,@xcite we derived the structure factor of a quantum liquid , which has the same physical properties",
    "as the laughlin liquid.@xcite the determination of the structure factor allows one to compute the energy of the quantum - liquid phase , which agrees to great accuracy with numerical results.@xcite away from precisely @xmath144 , the energy of the quantum liquid increases due to the excitation of quasiparticles/-holes of finite energy @xmath210 , which may be calculated analytically in the hamiltonian theory of the fqhe.@xcite this non - monotonous behavior of the quantum - liquid energy gives rise to an alternation between quantum - liquid phases , which are energetically favored around @xmath144 , and electron - solid phases having a lower energy in between .",
    "whereas the quantum liquids display the fqhe , the electron - solid phases , which form a triangular lattice of @xmath101-electron bubbles , are insulating because they are pinned by underlying impurities in the sample .",
    "the alternation of the different phases results in the observed riqhe between the fqhe states at @xmath40 , and the even - denominator state at half - filling in @xmath4.@xcite in @xmath38 , this competition between the different phases is manifest in the riqhe found around @xmath36 and @xmath37 and in the observation of an incipient quantum melting around @xmath211.@xcite it is not clear whether the quantum melting may lead to a fqhe at @xmath175 or @xmath176 in @xmath38 .",
    "our energy calculations indicate that the @xmath176 state is more stable than the @xmath157 state for a pure sample .",
    "impurities , however , favor electron - solid phases preferentially at lower @xmath2 .",
    "the interpretation of the riqhe in @xmath38 as being due to the formation of an insulating bubble phase is further supported by recent microwave experiments , which reveal a peak in the longitudinal conductivity at finite frequency.@xcite this peak is likely to be caused by the excitation of a collective depinning mode.@xcite microwave experiments in the riqhe regime would thus clarify the origin of these insulating phases and could determine the number of electrons @xmath101 per bubble because of the @xmath101-dependence of the resonance in the frequency - dependent conductivity .",
    "however , to the knowledge of the authors , such experimental investigations remain to be performed .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with k.  borejsza , j.  p.  eisenstein , t.  giamarchi , r.  moessner , v.  pasquier , n.  read , and s.  scheidl .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss national foundation for scientific research under grant no .",
    "620 - 62868.00 .",
    "in terms of fermionic operators , the hamiltonian ( [ equ001 ] ) reads @xmath212 where the indices @xmath21 at the operators are skipped for better legibility .",
    "this hamiltonian becomes in the hartree - fock approximation @xcite @xmath213\\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\hat{h}_{h}-\\hat{h}_{f}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hartree term is directly given in terms of the density operator @xmath214 with the hartree interaction potential @xmath215 .",
    "the average @xmath216 is proportional to the order parameter of the mean - field theory . in order to write the fock term in the same manner , we perform the variable transformations @xmath217 and in a second step @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the total number of states per ll .",
    "thus @xmath220 we finally obtain @xmath221 and one finds that the fock potential is the fourier transformed hartree potential accompanied by an interchange of the @xmath122- and @xmath222-axes @xmath223 that both the direct and the exchange potentials are related to each other by a fourier transformation , has already been pointed out in previous works for the case of an isotropic interaction.@xcite however , if the interaction is anisotropic , the rotation of the frame of reference by @xmath224 has to be taken into account in the calculation of the fock potential .",
    "the hartree - fock hamiltonian can therefore be written entirely in terms of the order parameter and the projected density operator @xmath225 with the effective hartree - fock potential @xmath226        m.  p.",
