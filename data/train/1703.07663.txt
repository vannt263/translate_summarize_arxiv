    "spaces of genuine bianchi modular forms have been used berger , dembl , pacetti and engn to construct evidence for the brumer  kramer paramodularity conjecture and the eichler ",
    "shimura conjecture  @xcite .",
    "this evidence however consists so far in just one abelian surface ( that is paramodular in the brumer ",
    "kramer setting ; and they deduce from it an abelian surface satisfying the eichler  shimura conjecture ) .",
    "no other non - trivial example for the eichler  shimura conjecture in dimension",
    "@xmath0 is present in the literature .",
    "this is due to the limitations of the database of genuine weight @xmath0 bianchi modular forms that was available to the four above - named authors . that database  @xcite did treat only level one bianchi modular forms , yielding extremely few genuine forms .",
    "so in order to systematically build up more evidence for the brumer  kramer paramodularity conjecture and the eichler  shimura conjecture in dimension @xmath0",
    ", it will not be enough to simply continue on a larger database of level one genuine bianchi modular forms , but rather one should use a database of higher level genuine bianchi modular forms . the latter type of database is provided with the present paper  @xcite . again , as for level one , the higher weight spaces of genuine forms are very rare , but the weight @xmath0 spaces in our database are more abundant , and give hope for the construction of an algorithm that could systematically produce the desired abelian surfaces .    in order to find the spaces of genuine bianchi modular forms in the present database , a major task was to establish dimension formulas for the non - genuine forms : for level one , formulas were already established by finis and grunewald  @xcite , yielding the dimensions of langlands base - change forms and complex multiplication ( cm ) forms outside the base - change space .",
    "these dimensions of the non - genuine subspace did , in  @xcite , only need to be subtracted from the full dimension of the bianchi modular forms space , which was computed on the machine from the geometry of the bianchi modular group .",
    "the latter machine computations extend to higher level via the eckmann ",
    "shapiro lemma , which is implemented for calculating the cohomology that corresponds to the bianchi modular forms space through the eichler ",
    "shimura(harder ) isomorphism .",
    "the base - change dimension formulas however did require a greater effort for their extension to higher level .",
    "what added a particular additional challenge here , is that at higher levels , also twists of base - change appear , and have to be taken care of as part of the non - genuine space .",
    "let @xmath1 be an imaginary quadratic field of discriminant @xmath2 , odd class number @xmath3 and ring of integers @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a square - free integer , coprime to @xmath2 .",
    "then we provide an explicit formula for the dimension of the space @xmath6 of non - genuine modular newforms of level @xmath7 and arbitrary weight @xmath8 in theorem  [ thm : trivial ] .",
    "this formula comes with instructions ( section  [ dimension formulas ] ) on how to evaluate it on a computer .",
    "we also provide such formulas for class number @xmath9 , @xmath10 for some prime @xmath11 and level @xmath12 or @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( see section  [ level a power of the discriminant ] ) .",
    "but our dimension formulas need to be explicit enough to be evaluable on the machine , so they involve a lot of case distinctions , and consequently are provided only for a part of the levels .",
    "the authors hope that it should however become clear for experts how to obtain formulas for the missing levels .",
    "for instance , for some theorems we assume that the class number is odd , which is equivalent to the discriminant being @xmath15 or @xmath16 or @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a prime congruent to @xmath19 modulo @xmath20",
    ". however , for even discriminants and class numbers , one should proceed analogously ( see the remarks in section  [ final remarks ] ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we can say that the formulas and databases established with the present paper constitute a significant progress on the question raised in section 9.1 of  @xcite on the exhaustion of spaces of newforms by non - genuine forms .      in section [ sec : setting ] , we fix the notation and assumptions that we will use throughout the paper .",
    "we also derive a first quantitative expression for the dimension of the base - change space . in section",
    "[ twists ] , we take the twists of base - change into account . in section  [ sec : cm ] , we establish formulas for the dimension of the space of cm - forms that are not base - change . in section",
    "[ sec : total ] , we provide a formula for the total dimension of the space generated by newforms that are non - genuine , i.e. of any of the three types mentioned above . this formula is made explicit in section  [ dimension formulas ] , in a way that it can be evaluated on the machine .",
    "we make some concluding remarks on our formulas in section  [ final remarks ] . in section  [ sec",
    ": computational ] , we present our machine results , in which the non - genuine dimension is subtracted from the full dimension of the newforms space , the latter being computed from the geometry of the bianchi modular group . due to the sparsity of the genuine forms ,",
    "those results can be considered as a treasure map to the conditions under which they exist .",

    "let @xmath21 be a square - free integer and let @xmath22 and denote its ring of integers by @xmath4 .",
    "for any ideal @xmath23 of @xmath24 and integer @xmath25 we let @xmath26 denote the space of cuspidal bianchi modular forms over @xmath1 of weight @xmath27 , level @xmath23 and trivial nebentypus .",
    "this space admits an action of a hecke algebra generated by operators indexed by the prime ideals of @xmath24 .",
    "each eigenvector @xmath28 of this algebra corresponds to an automorphic representation @xmath29 in @xmath30 , the set of all cuspidal automorphic representations of gl@xmath31 .",
    "we are interested in the ones appearing in the image of the base - change operator defined by langlands @xcite , @xmath32 along with their twists .",
    "here we generalise the formula of @xcite to arbitrary level @xmath23 coprime to the discriminant @xmath2 of @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , we provide an algorithm computing the dimension of this space without really computing the spaces in hand . in some simple cases we also provide explicit formulas .",
    "we also provide an algorithm for level @xmath33 , where @xmath18 is a rational prime that ramifies in @xmath1 .",
    "we hope that our proposed strategy outlines a complete plan for the interested reader to fill out the missing level cases without much effort .",
    "it is clear that without loss of generality it is enough to study the base - change image problem on the new subspace of @xmath26 , which we will denote by @xmath34 in the rest of this paper .",
    "a necessary condition for base - change to have non - trivial image is that the level is galois stable , i.e. an ideal generated by a rational number .",
    "let @xmath35 for some @xmath36 coprime to  @xmath2 .",
    "the first crucial observation is that one can consider the base - change operator locally .",
    "let @xmath37 be an automorphic representation in the base - change image .",
    "then for any prime ideal @xmath12 coprime to  @xmath2 , the conductor of @xmath38 is the extension to @xmath24 of the conductor of @xmath39 , where @xmath18 is the prime below @xmath12 .",
    "we therefore get that if @xmath40 contributes to the base - change subspace of @xmath34 , then its conductor away from @xmath2 is exactly @xmath41 .",
    "this leaves us with the primes dividing the discriminant .",
    "let @xmath12 divide @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath38 is a principal unramified series , since we required that the level is coprime to the discriminant .",
    "let @xmath42 be the quadratic character of conductor @xmath18 .",
    "a complete list of all the possible local components @xmath39 of @xmath40 at @xmath18 is provided in @xcite which we also provide here for convenience :    * unramified principal series .",
    "* @xmath43 . * a certain supercuspidal representation ( of conductor @xmath44 when @xmath45 ) .",
    "we now have a complete description of the inverse image of the base - change operator in terms of its inertial type at the primes @xmath46 : if @xmath47 , then the type can be anything of conductor equal to the power of @xmath18 dividing @xmath41 . and",
    "if @xmath48 , then it is one of the types mentioned above . in order to compute the dimension of the base - change subspace we would have to keep in mind that the base - change map is one - to - one when the component at a ramified prime is of the first kind and two - to - one if it is of the other two .",
    "moreover , if a newform in the preimage spaces has cm by @xmath1 , then its image is eisenstein , so it does not contribute to the dimension .",
    "the above discussion yields the following formula .",
    "[ prop : formula ] let @xmath49 be the set of prime divisors of @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the quadratic character of conductor @xmath50 , under the convention that @xmath51 is trivial at a prime @xmath52 if and only if @xmath53 .",
    "+ then we obtain @xmath54 where for each @xmath50 , the space @xmath55 is the subspace of @xmath56 spanned by newforms whose local type at every @xmath53 is the supercuspidal representation mentioned above . and @xmath57 is the @xmath58 subspace .    of course many of the spaces appearing on the right hand side are trivial since the parity of their nebentypus does not match that of the weight @xmath8 .",
    "the final key observation is that we have formulas for all of the spaces appearing on the right hand side of the above formula ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "it is fairly easy to see that it is possible to obtain non base - change forms just by twisting a base - change one by a suitable non base - change character .",
    "we would like to count these forms out of our genuine forms subspace and therefore we would like to find the dimension of the subspace they span as well .",
    "let us denote by @xmath59 the subspace of @xmath34 generated by those newforms that are twists of base - change .",
    "for this purpose , we say that @xmath60 is _ twist of base - change _ , if there exists a classical weight @xmath8 modular form @xmath61 of level @xmath62 with @xmath63 dividing @xmath23 , such that @xmath64 for some non - trivial character @xmath65 .",
    "we first prove the following :    [ thm : twist-2 ] let @xmath1 be an imaginary quadratic field of discriminant @xmath2 and class number @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a square - free integer , coprime to @xmath2 .",

    "let @xmath71 be a non base - change character of @xmath72 and assume it has non - trivial conductor @xmath73 . let @xmath74 be a prime ideal of @xmath1",
    ". then @xmath75 has level divisible by @xmath76 and its type at @xmath69 is @xmath77 or @xmath78 . in both cases ,",
    "the type comes from base - change if and only if @xmath71 does .",
    "this shows that such an @xmath71 can not be used to twist a non base - change form to a base - change one and vice versa .",
    "the only option left for @xmath71 is to be non base - change and to have trivial conductor .",
    "there precisely @xmath79 many such characters .",
    "indeed each such character has the desired property which gives the desired result .",
    "another subspace we would like to exclude as non genuine is the one generated by cm - newforms .",
    "they are the ones whose corresponding automorphic representation occurs as the automorphic induction of a suitable hecke character of a quadratic extension @xmath80 .",
    "let us denote this subspace by @xmath81 .",
    "it is quite often the case that @xmath82 , but not always",
    ". nevertheless one can easily prove the following :    [ thm : cm ] let @xmath1 and @xmath23 be as in theorem [ thm : twist-2 ] .",
    "moreover assume that @xmath3 is odd .",

    "let @xmath85 be the hecke character of some extension @xmath80 whose automorphic induction is @xmath84 .",
    "we then have that @xmath86 .",
    "equating local components at any prime @xmath69 dividing the discriminant @xmath87 we see that @xmath76 should divide  @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath23 is assumed to be square - free no such @xmath69 should exist and thus the extension @xmath80 is unramified .",
    "this provides the desired contradiction since the class number of @xmath1 is assumed to be odd .",
    "in this section we provide a formula for the total dimension of the space generated by newforms that are `` non - genuine '' in any of the three notions discussed above , i.e. a formula for @xmath88 let us denote this space by @xmath89 . then combining theorem  [ thm : twist-2 ] , theorem  [ thm : cm ] and proposition  [ prop : formula ] yields the following :    [ thm : trivial ] let @xmath1 be an imaginary quadratic field of discriminant @xmath2 and odd class number @xmath3 , and @xmath5 be a square - free integer , coprime to @xmath2",

    "in this section we provide explicit formulas / algorithm for the right hand side of the formula in theorem [ thm : trivial ] .",
    "we split the computation into two parts , each involving one of the two main ingredients of each summand in the right hand side of ( [ eq : main ] ) .",
    "our starting point is proposition 4.18 in @xcite which we provide here for convenience . here , we denote by @xmath92 the space of weight @xmath8 elliptic modular forms for the principal congruence subgroup @xmath93 sl@xmath94 of level @xmath41 .",

    "then , @xmath106    the constants @xmath107 and @xmath108 are explicit functions of @xmath8 and @xmath109 is the usual kronecker delta notation . in what follows , given a subspace of newforms @xmath110 , we will say that @xmath97 _ defines _",
    "@xmath111 if @xmath112 .",
    "we thus need to identify a suitable @xmath97 for each subspace involved in the last line of ( [ eq : main ] ) .",
    "in fact we only need to compute the following five invariants associated to such a sigma : @xmath113 we will denote them by @xmath114 , @xmath115 respectively .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath97 , and therefore the five invariants associated with it , depends only on the level structure of the subspace that is of interest to us and not the weight .",
    "it is also clear that the following properties hold : @xmath116 and @xmath117 for all @xmath118 , @xmath119 and for all @xmath115 .",
    "let us fix one of the spaces in the right hand side of the formula in theorem [ thm : trivial ] , @xmath120 say , and let @xmath97 be the representation defining it .",
    "in view of the properties just mentioned , we will compute the @xmath114 by determining the @xmath41-part and the @xmath50-part separately .    in order to compute the @xmath41-part ,",
    "it is enough to notice that it corresponds to the one defining @xmath121 . given an integer @xmath5 , let @xmath122 and @xmath123 be the representation of @xmath104 defining @xmath124 and @xmath121 respectively .",

    "the @xmath132 s for each @xmath139 , with @xmath140 , have already been determined in @xcite .",

    "we follow the method used in @xcite to count cm newforms of a given level , weight and nebentypus . as explained there ,",
    "every newform has associated to it a pair of characters @xmath149 that satisfies a certain compatibility condition . moreover , for every such compatible pair , there are @xmath3 many newforms associated with it .",
    "the problem is thus reduced to counting compatible pairs that match the prescribed level , weight and nebentypus .",

    "since @xmath41 and @xmath2 are coprime , every prime dividing @xmath41 should divide @xmath153 too .",
    "moreover , a prime @xmath140 divides @xmath153 if and only if @xmath154 . we will treat primes @xmath69 separately , depending on their ramification and residue class degree , @xmath155 and @xmath156 respectively .",
    "we start with primes @xmath18 whose residue characteristic is greater than @xmath0 .      in this case",

    "the residues of rational integers form a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath168 which is generated by @xmath169 and @xmath164.since the restriction of @xmath150 on @xmath170 is predetermined by the nebentypus we have unique choices for @xmath169 and @xmath164 . in our case",

    "<S> bianchi modular forms are automorphic forms over an imaginary quadratic field , associated to a bianchi group . </S>",
    "<S> even though modern studies of bianchi modular forms go back to the mid 1960 s , most of the fundamental problems surrounding their theory are still wide open . only for certain types of bianchi modular forms , which we will call non - genuine , it is possible at present to develop dimension formulas : they are ( twists of ) those forms which arise from elliptic cuspidal modular forms via the langlands base - change procedure , or arise from a quadratic extension of the imaginary quadratic field via automorphic induction ( so - called cm - forms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining bianchi modular forms are what we call genuine , and they are of interest for an extension of the modularity theorem ( formerly the taniyama - shimura conjecture , crucial in the proof of femat s last theorem ) to imaginary quadratic fields . in a preceding paper by rahm and engn , </S>",
    "<S> an extreme paucity of genuine cuspidal bianchi modular forms has been reported , but those and other computations were restricted to level one . in this paper , we are extending the formulas for the non - genuine bianchi modular forms to deeper levels , and we are able to spot the first , rare instances of genuine forms at deeper level and heavier weight . </S>"
