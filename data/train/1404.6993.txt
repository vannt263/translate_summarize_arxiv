    "social dynamics have been studied through statistical physics techniques in the last twenty years and are now part of the new branch of physics called sociophysics @xcite .",
    "this recent research area uses tools and concepts of the physics of disordered matter and more recently from the network science to describe some aspects of social and political behavior @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , opinion models are interesting to physicists because they present correlations , order - disorder transitions , scaling and universality , among other typical features of physical systems @xcite",
    ".    one of the most studied models of opinion formation is the majority - rule model @xcite .",
    "it considers a population of @xmath0 agents , each carrying one of two possible opinions @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "a group of @xmath3 agents ( where @xmath3 is an odd number ) is picked at random and all agents in the group adopt the state of the local majority .",
    "these rules are repeated until the system reaches a final state of consensus , where all agents are @xmath1- or @xmath2-supporters . in this work",
    "we introduce a mechanism in the majority - rule model that limits the capacity of persuasion of the majorities , and study the impact of this limitation on the opinion formation .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the model , define its microscopic rules and discuss the numerical results .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 3 .",
    "we consider a population of @xmath4 agents with opinions @xmath1 or @xmath2 concerning a given subject .",
    "the initial fraction of @xmath1-supporters is @xmath5 at @xmath6 .",
    "each agent @xmath7 has its own `` convincing power '' ( cp ) , a real number @xmath8 initially sorted uniformly inside a given interval @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "a group of @xmath10 agents is randomly chosen .",
    "if there is a majority of two , say @xmath11 and @xmath7 , in favor of one opinion and the average convincing power @xmath12 of this pair is larger than that of the third agent , say @xmath13 , this last flips his opinion and the winning pair @xmath14 increases its convincing powers , i.e. , we update @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "otherwise , nothing occurs .",
    "one time step in the model consists of the application of those rules @xmath0 times .",
    "notice from the microscopic rules that the agents capacities of persuasion are limited , compared with the traditional pure majority - rule : only if @xmath17 the majority succeeds in convincing the minority within the tossed @xmath3-group .",
    "in addition , the updating of the cps models the tendency for a given agent who succeeds in persuading many others to increase his persuasion ability @xcite . this new ingredient introduces a historical long - term memory into the dynamical evolution which turns it non - trivial , with its non - ergodicity exhibited since beginning .",
    "agents by any kind of global average .",
    "] thus , the inclusion of the above rules is a simple form to capture this real - world characteristic .",
    "notice also that the distribution of cps ( uniform inside @xmath9 $ ] at beginning or any other future form ) can be freely translated by a constant displacement ( as a whole ) , and thus can include even negative numbers .",
    "this is due to the fact that only the relative difference among the convincing powers ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) matters .    in this work",
    "we will present results for @xmath20 , but the behavior of the model does not depend qualitatively on the value of @xmath21 .",
    "one can start studying the time evolution of one of the two fractions of opinions @xmath1 or @xmath2 , represented by ising variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . since the system is symmetric around @xmath24 , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we exhibit the time evolution of the fraction @xmath25 of @xmath1-opinions for typical values of @xmath26 and population size @xmath27 . in opposition to what occurs in the pure majority - rule model @xcite , the initial minority can grow , eventually dominating all the population . for the case",

    "after few time steps the number of individuals with the minority opinion @xmath1 ( @xmath30 ) decreases , but the majority opinion @xmath2 does not reach @xmath31 of the population . in this case , the system remains in this state near the consensus with @xmath32 ( and @xmath33 ) for a long time , but after that the number of individuals with @xmath22 starts to increase and suddenly grows until the consensus state with @xmath34 .",
    "this behavior occurs for all simulated samples ( 5 for the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , thousands in total ) . in the case @xmath35",
    ", one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) that there is an oscillation with respect to the majority opinion : initially the opinion @xmath1 ( @xmath22 ) is the minority one , but after some time steps a reversion occurs and the opinion @xmath2 ( @xmath36 ) becomes the ( second ) minority . in this case , the state @xmath23 is shared by a very small fraction of the population , less than the previous @xmath1-minority ( near @xmath37 , see fig .",

    "this new global @xmath2-minority opinion grows and dominates all the population near @xmath38 .",
