    "there is by now convincing observational evidence that the universe is currently in a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "the favored explanation for this behavior is the existence of vacuum energy or , in a more general setting , of dark energy .",
    "the observations suggest that the universe currently consist of approximately 73 % dark energy , 23 % dark matter , and 4% ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "the nature and origin of the dominating dark energy component is not understood , and many different models co - exist .",
    "the simplest models associate dark energy with the vacuum energy of some unknown self - interacting scalar field , whose potential energy yields a cosmological constant @xcite . in quintessence models slowly evolving scalar fields with a nontrivial equation of state are considered @xcite .",
    "string theory also yields possible candidates of scalar fields who might generate dark energy , in form of run - away dilatons and moduli fields @xcite .",
    "various exotic forms of matter such as phantom matter @xcite and born - infeld quantum condensates @xcite are currently being discussed .",
    "for some superstring cosmology ideas related to small cosmological constants , see also @xcite .",
    "when trying to formulate a suitable model for dark energy , at least two unsolved fundamental problems arise :    \\1 . _",
    "the cosmological constant problem .",
    "_ why is the observed vacuum energy density so small , as compared to typical predictions of particle physics models ? from electroweak symmetry breaking via",
    "the higgs mechanism one obtains a vacuum energy density prediction that is too large by a factor @xmath0 as compared to the currently observed value .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking in gut models is even worse , it yields a discrepancy by a factor @xmath1 .",
    "\\2 . _ the cosmological coincidence problem .",
    "_ why is the order of magnitude of the currently observed vacuum energy density the same as that of the matter density ?",
    "a true cosmological constant stays constant during the expansion of the universe , whereas the matter energy density decreases with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the scale factor in the robertson walker metric .",
    "it looks like a very strange coincidence that right now we live at an epoch where the vacuum energy density and matter density have the same order of magnitude , if during the evolution of the universe one is constant and the other one decreases as @xmath4 .    to this list",
    "one may add yet another fundamental problem , which we may call    \\3 .",
    "_ the uniqueness problem .",
    "_ string theory allows for an enourmous amount of possible vacua after compactification . in each of these states",
    "the fundamental constants of nature can take on different possible values .",
    "but what is the mechanism that selects out of these infinitely many possibilities the physically relevant vacuum state , with its associated fundamental constants that give rise to a universe of the type we know it ( that ultimately even enabled the development of life ) ?",
    "relating the answer purely to an anthropic principle seems unsatisfactory .    in this paper",
    "we consider a new model for dark energy which , as compared to other models , is rather conservative .",
    "it just associates dark energy with self - interacting scalar fields corresponding to a @xmath5-theory , which is second quantized .",
    "however , the fundamental difference to previous approaches is that these fields are very strongly ( rather than weakly ) self - interacting , and that 2nd quantization effects play an important role",
    ". we will use as the relevant method to quantize the scalar fields the stochastic quantization method introduced by parisi and wu @xcite . in the fictitious time variable of this approach",
    ", the fields will turn out to perform rapid deterministic chaotic oscillations , due to the fact that we consider not a weakly but a very strongly self - interacting field .",
    "this chaotic behavior is a new effect not present in any classical treatment .",
    "it is generally well known that chaos plays an important role in general relativity @xcite , quantum field theories @xcite , and string theories @xcite .",
    "the main result of our consideration is that the chaotic field theories considered naturally generate a small cosmological constant and have the scope to offer simultaneous solutions to the cosmological coincidence and uniqueness problem .",
    "our physical interpretation is to associate the chaotic behaviour of the scalar fields with tiny vacuum fluctuations which are allowed within the bounds set by the uncertainty relation , due to the finite age of the universe .",
    "this interpretation naturally leads to the right amount of dark energy density being generated , and fine tuning can be avoided .",
    "the chaotic fields ( presently ) have a classical equation of state close to @xmath6 , and can thus account for the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "however , during the early evolution of the universe they behave in a different way : they effectively track radiation and matter .",
    "this property will help to avoid the cosmological coincidence problem .",
    "the chaotic model also contains an interesting symmetry between gravitational and gauge couplings . in our model the role of a metric for the 5th coordinate ( the fictitious time ) is taken over by dimensionless coupling constants which are given by the ratio of the fictious time lattice constant and physical time lattice constant squared ( both lattice constants can still go to zero , just their ratio is fixed ) .",
    "these coupling constants do not occur in any classical treatment but are entirely a consequence of our second quantized treatment .",
    "the vacuum energy generated depends on these couplings in a non - trivial way .",
    "the physical significance of our model is illustrated by the fact that we numerically observe the vacuum energy to have local minima for coupling constants that numerically coincide with running electroweak coupling strengths , evaluated at the known fermionic mass scales , as well as running strong coupling constants evaluated at the known bosonic mass scales .",
    "this numerical observation , previously reported in @xcite , is now embedded into a cosmological context .",
    "the role of the chaotic fields in the universe can be understood in the sense that they are responsible for fixing and stabilizing fundamental parameters as local minima in the dark energy landscape .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the role the dilaton field plays in string theory after supersymmetry breaking .",
    "our numerical discovery of local minima that coincide with known standard model coupling constants makes it very unlikely that there are different universes with different fundamental parameters .",
    "in fact , the numerical results provide strong evidence that there is a unique vacuum state of the universe that possesses minimum vacuum energy precisely for the known set of standard model parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we show how a second - quantized scalar field dynamics can degenerate to a chaotic dynamics in fictitious time .",
    "our main example is a chaotic @xmath5-theory leading to 3rd order tchebyscheff maps , which is dealt with in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present a physical interpretation of the chaotic dynamics using the uncertainty relation , which in a natural way fixes the order of magnitude of the vacuum energy density to be generated .",
    "section 5 deals with energy , pressure and classical equation of state of the chaotic fields . in section 6",
    "we consider the einstein equations associated with our model and discuss a possible way to avoid the cosmological coincidence problem .",
    "section 7 yields a prediction for the current ratio of matter energy density and dark energy density to the critical energy density . in section 8",
    "we describe how local minima of the dark energy landscape generated by the chaotic fields can fix the fundamental parameters .",
    "finally , in section 9 we discuss spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomena for the chaotic fields .",
    "let us consider a self - interacting scalar field @xmath7 in robertson - walker metric . for a complete theory describing all quantum mechanical fluctuations we need to second - quantize it .",
    "this can be done via stochastic quantization . in the parisi - wu approach of stochastic quantization",
    "one considers a stochastic differential equation evolving in a fictitious time variable @xmath8 , the drift term being given by the classical field equation @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanical expectations correspond to expectations with respect to the generated stochastic processes in the limit @xmath9 .",

    "in particular , this map may even exhibit chaotic behaviour .    as a distinguished example of a @xmath5-theory generating strongest possible chaotic behaviour ,",

    "@xmath46 is the negative third - order tchebyscheff map , a standard example of a map exhibiting strongly chaotic behaviour .",

    "the corresponding potential is given by @xmath47 or , in terms of the dimensionless field @xmath40 , @xmath48 apparently , starting from this potential we obtain by second quantization a field @xmath7 that rapidly fluctuates in fictitious time on some finite interval , provided that initially @xmath49 $ ] . the small noise term in eq .",
    "( [ sym ] ) can be neglected as compared to the deterministic chaotic fluctuations of the field .    of physical relevance",
    "are the expectations of suitable observables with respect to the ergodic chaotic dynamics .",
    "for example , the expectation @xmath50 of the potential is a possible candidate for vacuum energy in our universe .",
    "one obtains @xmath51 for uncoupled tchebyscheff maps ( @xmath52 ) , expectations of any observable @xmath53 can be evaluated as the ergodic average @xmath54 with the natural invariant measure being given by @xmath55 ( see any textbook on chaotic dynamics , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this measure describes the probability distribution of the iterates under long - term iteration . from eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) one obtains @xmath56 and @xmath57 , thus @xmath58    alternatively , we may consider the positive tchebyscheff map @xmath59 .",
    "this basically exhibits the same dynamics as @xmath46 , up to a sign .",
    "repeating the same calculation we obtain @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the expectation of the vacuum energy one gets @xmath62 which for @xmath52 reduces to @xmath63 symmetry considerations between @xmath46 and @xmath64 suggest to take the additive constant @xmath65 as @xmath66 in this case one obtains the fully symmetric equation @xmath67 which for @xmath68 reduces to @xmath69    the simplest model for dark energy in the universe , as generated by a chaotic @xmath5-theory , would be to identify @xmath70 , the constant vacuum energy density corresponding to a classical cosmological constant @xmath71 , which stays constant during the expansion of the universe .",
    "this is certainly a possible simple model . on the other hand , such an approach",
    "would neither solve the cosmological constant nor the cosmological coincidence problem .",
    "for this reason we will turn to a more advanced model in the following sections , which will naturally produces the right amount of vacuum energy density in the universe .    before proceeding to this model ,",
    "let us provide some general comments on the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the vacuum energy generated by the chaotic fields is inversely proportional to @xmath19 ( see eq .",

    "the advantage of our formulation in terms of stochastic quantization is that for the dimensionless chaotically evolving field @xmath40 the potential remains finite ( see , e.g. , eq .  ( [ 23 ] ) ) .",
    "if there is no fictitious time , then the parameter @xmath19 enters in form of the ( singular ) potential parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in the next section",
    "we will argue that on physical grounds it makes sense to consider very small but finite @xmath19 .",
    "to obtain quantitative statements on the dark energy density as generated by some chaotically evolving field @xmath7 , let us fix the free parameters @xmath19 and @xmath29 by some physical arguments .",

    "it is the lattice constant of fictitious time @xmath8 and has dimension @xmath80 .",
    "ordinary stochastic quantization based on gaussian white noise requires the continuum limit @xmath20 .",
    "but since quantum field theory runs into difficulties at the planck scale @xmath81 and is expected to be replaced by a more advanced theory at this scale , it is most reasonable to take the small but finite value @xmath82    next , consider the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "it has dimension @xmath83 and describes the maximum energy scale of our rapidly fluctuating scalar fields @xmath7 , who take on values on the finite interval @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "a natural value of @xmath29 follows if one associates the rapidly fluctuating chaotic fields @xmath23 with vacuum fluctuations that are allowed due to the uncertainty relation @xmath84 taking @xmath85 of the order of the age of the universe , a corresponding energy uncertainty @xmath86 arises .",
    "this @xmath87 is very large for a very young universe , and then decreases to extremely small values for the current age of the universe of about 13.7 gyr .",
    "any finite age @xmath10 of the universe implies that spontaneous vacuum fluctuations with energies of order @xmath88 can occur .",
    "it is physically plausible to identify these energy fluctuations @xmath86 with the rapidly fluctuating chaotic fields @xmath89 , since both @xmath87 and @xmath7 live on a finite interval , and both fluctuate in an unpredictable way .",
    "the uncertainty relation ( [ h ] ) together with @xmath90 implies ( in units where @xmath91 ) @xmath92 in this way the energy scale @xmath29 occurring in the chaotic field theories is most naturally identified with the inverse age of the universe .",
    "however , note that this quantum mechanical interpretation in terms of vacuum fluctuations requires a _ chaotic _",
    "map @xmath31 , since some regularly evolving @xmath27 can not be associated with fluctuations at all .",
    "it is remarkable that by taking eq .",

( [ rhoc ] ) only yields order - of magnitude estimates .",
    "nevertheless , it is instructive to work out some concrete numbers , based on simple model assumptions .",
    "for example , we may assume that the entire vacuum energy of the universe is due to one chaotic field described by @xmath99 .",
    "the current age of the universe is @xmath100 gyr @xmath101 @xcite . using an uncertainty relation of the form @xmath102 we get @xmath103 gev .",
    "choosing @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is some dimensionless number of @xmath106 , we get @xmath107 the current observational estimate of dark energy density in the universe is @xcite @xmath108 which is consistent with @xmath109 .",
    "if the observed dark energy in the universe is produced by our chaotic theory , then the measured data imply @xmath110 once again , this estimate is based on concrete model assumption . in general , we do do not know the precise values of the proportionality constants in eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) and ( [ hh ] ) , moreover we do not know how many different chaotic fields may contribute to the dark energy of the universe .",
    "of course , the actual properties of the chaotic dark energy component depend on the classical equation of state of the chaotic fields , which will be dealt with in the next section .",

    "in general , the expectation of the total energy density @xmath115 is given by @xmath116 and the expectation of the pressure by @xmath117 for the map @xmath46 one obtains @xmath118 where the additive constant of the self - interacting potential is fixed by the symmetry consideration of section 3 .",
    "the above equations yield the equation of state @xmath119 which varies as a function of the coupling @xmath25 in a nontrivial way .    for @xmath120 ,",
    "the equation of state of our fields is @xmath6 , since the expectation of kinetic energy vanishes ( all expectations should be interpreted as quantum mechanical expectations with respect to second quantization ) . for small @xmath25",
    ", @xmath121 is close to @xmath122 .",
    "it should be clear that although our fields fluctuate rapidly in both physical and fictitious time , these fluctuations are averaged away when doing the quantum mechanical expectations .",
    "thus the classical picture that arises out of this 2nd quantized rapidly fluctuating model is a very homogeneous field .    the expectations in eqs .",
    "( [ sbarba1 ] ) , ( [ sbarba2 ] ) are easily numerically calculated by long - term iterating the coupled map lattice for random initial conditions and averaging over all @xmath18 and @xmath17 .",

    "the case @xmath191 is called diffusive coupling , the case @xmath192 anti - diffusive coupling. chaotic fields with @xmath193 are called to be of type a ( @xmath194 , chaotic fields with @xmath195 to be of type b ( @xmath196 ) . in @xcite",
    "the chaotic fields were called chaotic strings , but this is only a different name for the same dynamics . our derivation in section 2 lead to chaotic fields of b - type with diffusive coupling ,",
    "but from a dynamical systems point of view all 4 degrees of freedom ( @xmath197 ) exist and are of relevance .",
    "as shown in detail in @xcite , there are two different types of vacuum energies for the chaotic fields , namely    \\1 .",
    "the self energy @xmath198 and    \\2 . the interaction energy @xmath199 eq .",
    "( [ pose ] ) actually represents the self energy of the map @xmath46 , the self energy of the map @xmath150 has opposite sign and cancels the self energy of @xmath46 in the symmetric phase .",
    "basically , the self energy is the expectation of the potential that generates the chaotic dynamics in fictitious time , and the interaction energy is the expectation of the potential that generates the diffusive coupling in physical time .",
    "one may also define a total vacuum energy as @xmath200 , where the @xmath201 sign corresponds to diffusive and the @xmath202 sign to anti - diffusive coupling .",
    "all additive constants are fixed by the postulate of invariance of the theory under global and local @xmath203-transformations @xcite .",
    "in other words , we allow for the existence of a symmetric phase . for small @xmath25 the interaction energy can be neglected as compared to the self energy , moreover , the type - a and type - b forms are observed to have the same self energy in this limit .",
    "the central hypothesis of this paper is a symmetry between standard model coupling constants and the chaotic field couplings @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that for any dimensionless coupling constant @xmath25 that appears in the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions , there is a corresponding chaotic field that is just coupled with this @xmath25 .",
    "the universe then tries to reach a state of minimum vacuum energy by adjusting its free parameters in such a way that the chaotic fields reach a state of minimum vacuum energy .    while at first sight this may look like a purely theoretical concept , there is numerical evidence that this principle is indeed physically realized . as an example , fig .",
    "3 shows the self energy @xmath204 of our chaotic fields of type a with diffusive coupling in the low - coupling region .",
    "we observe that @xmath205 has local minima at @xmath206 ( @xmath207 and @xmath208 are actually small local minima on top of the hill ) .    on the other hand , in the standard model of electroweak interactions the weak coupling constant",
    "is given by @xmath209 here @xmath210 is the electric charge of the particle ( @xmath211 for electrons , @xmath212 for @xmath213-like quarks , @xmath214 for @xmath215-like quarks ) , and @xmath64 is the third component of the isospin ( @xmath216 for right - handed particles , @xmath217 for @xmath218 and @xmath219 , @xmath220 for @xmath221 and @xmath222 ) .",
    "consider right - handed fermions @xmath223 . with @xmath224 ( as experimentally measured @xcite ) and the running electric coupling @xmath225 taken at energy scale @xmath226 we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ aweak ] ) the numerical values @xmath227 there is an amazing numerical coincidence between the local minima @xmath228 of @xmath205 and the weak coupling constants of @xmath229 , respectively .",
    "now regard the fine structure constant @xmath230 and the weinberg angle @xmath231 as a priori free parameters .",
    "suppose these parameters would change to slightly different values .",
    "then immediately this would produce larger vacuum energy @xmath205 , since we get out of the local minima .",
    "the system is expected to be driven back to the local minima , and the fundamental parameters are stabilized in this way , provided the universe is in an asymmetric phase .",
    "the above example is only one example of a large number of numerical coincidences observed . in @xcite",
    "an extensive numerical investigation of self energies , interaction energies , and total vacuum energies was performed for the above chaotic field theories .",
    "a large number of amazing numerical coincidences was found - theory the relevant energy scale is always @xmath232 .",
    "the factor 3 can be related to the index of the tchebyscheff polynomial considered @xcite . ] .",
    "these results are described in detail in @xcite , we here only summarize the main results .    1 .",
    "the smallest ( stable ) zeros of the interaction energy @xmath233 coincide with running electroweak coupling constants , evaluated at energies given by the smallest fermionic mass scales .",
    "type ( a ) describes @xmath215-quarks and electrons interacting electrically , type ( b ) @xmath213-quarks and neutrinos interacting weakly . 2 .",
    "local minima of the self energy @xmath205 coincide with running weak coupling constants of right - handed fermions , evaluated at the lightest fermionic mass scales .",
    "3 .   local minima of the total vacuum energy @xmath234 occur at running strong coupling constants evaluated at the lightest baryonic energy scales .",
    "local minima of the total vacuum energy @xmath235 occur at running strong couplings evaluated at the lightest mesonic energy scales .    in @xcite also chaotic fields corresponding to 2nd order tchebyscheff maps",
    "were investigated ( see appendix ) , and the following numerical coincidences were found :    1 .   the smallest ( stable ) zeros of @xmath233 coincide with running strong coupling constants evaluated at the smallest bosonic mass scales .",
    "type ( a ) describes the @xmath236 boson , type ( b ) the higgs boson .",
    "2 .   local minima of the self energy @xmath205 coincide with yukawa and gravitational couplings evaluated at the fermionic mass scales .    for more details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "all these numerically observed coincidences are not explainable as a random coincidence .",
    "rather , they suggest to interpret the coupling constant @xmath25 of our second - quantized chaotic fields @xmath7 as a running gauge coupling . we are free to identify @xmath237 with a gauge coupling , since the occurence of a ratio of lattice constants @xmath19 and @xmath238 is a new effect in our 2nd quantized discretized theory , and there is no theory of this dimensionless number so far , which represents a kind of metric for the 5th coordinate ( the fictitious time ) .",
    "so we are indeed free to make the hypothesis that @xmath25 coincides with a running gauge coupling . by doing so , we implicitly construct a symmetry between gauge couplings and gravitational couplings , since usually the strength of the kinetic term in the action of a field is determined by the metric , i.e.  gravitational effects , whereas here it is fixed by standard model coupling strengths .",
    "the chaotic fields appear to select out of the infinitely many vacua allowed by string theory the unique ground state that corresponds to the known coupling constants of the universe .",
    "all free parameters are fixed in the sense that if the fundamental parameters ( masses , coupling constants , and mixing angles ) had different values , larger vacuum energy would arise .",
    "chaotic scalar fields not only allow for a simple mechanism to produce dark energy , they also yield a simple mechanism to cancel unwanted dark energy .",
    "if we assume that both the positive and negative tchebyscheff dynamics are physically realized , the corresponding vacuum energies precisely cancel for symmetry reasons ( see eq .",
    "( [ symmetry ] ) ) .",
    "this symmetry is a @xmath203 symmetry which is not there for ordinary smoothly evolving scalar fields ( where opposite potentials lead to unstable or ill - defined behavior ) . on the other hand , if only the negative tchebyscheff field dynamics is active , or if it dominates , then positive dark energy arises .",
    "this positive dark energy can drive inflation , fix standard model parameters as local minima in the dark energy landscape , and generate late - time acceleration .",
    "it is therefore desirable to construct a theory that allows for @xmath203 symmetry breaking between positive and negative tchebyscheff maps .",
    "it is clear that in order to fix fundamental parameters with the methods described in the previous section , we must have a broken @xmath203 symmetry at some stage of the evolution of the universe .",
    "indeed , the minimum requirement we need is at least one very early stage of broken symmetry , in order to _ first - time fix _ the fundamental parameters to the values which make the universe work , and another late - time asymptotic state of broken symmetry , in order to _ stabilize _ the parameters to their known values so that they can not drift away to other values .",
    "it is natural to identify the first phase of broken symmetry with the inflationary phase @xcite , and the other phase of broken symmetry with the late - time state of the universe .",
    "inbetween , we may allow for a symmetric state , which has the advantage that nucleosynthesis is not spoilt .    as a concrete simple model ,",
    "consider a scalar field @xmath239 which takes on the value @xmath240 in the symmetric phase and the values @xmath241 in the phase where the @xmath203-symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the total potential describing the chaotic field dynamics is given by @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the potential generating the negative tchebyscheff field dynamics and @xmath244 the one generating the positive tchebyscheff field dynamics in fictitious time ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "in the symmetric phase ( @xmath245 ) we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ totalv ] ) @xmath246 wheras in a broken phase with @xmath192 we obtain @xmath247 where we have re - labeled @xmath248 .",
    "we assume that the symmetry is first spontaneously broken to @xmath192 at the onset of inflation .",
    "a large amount of positive vacuum energy is generated via eq .",
    "( [ posvac ] ) , since at this stage the universe is very young and @xmath249 .",
    "the chaotic fields can help to drive inflation , and fundamental parameters are pre - fixed as local minima in the dark energy landscape .",
    "then , there is a symmetric phase with @xmath245 .",
    "the consideration of section 7 applies but the dark energy is suppressed due to symmetry reasons .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis and galaxy formation can go ahead without any problems .",
    "note that during the symmetric epoch the fundamental parameters are no longer stabilized as local minima in the dark energy landscape .",
    "they can drift to slightly different values .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental findings of a varying fine structure constant @xcite .",
    "finally , there is late - time symmetry breaking to @xmath192 .",
    "this phase is necessary because otherwise the fundamental parameters would keep on drifting to different values . by the late - time symmetry breaking ,",
    "the parameters are finally forced back and stabilized at their equilibrium values , which were already pre - fixed during inflation .",
    "this gives physical sense to the role of late - time dark energy in the universe .",
    "late - time symmetry breaking could be physically understood as follows .",
    "suppose the negative tschebyscheff dynamics ( which generates positive vacuum energy ) is always uniformly distributed in space .",
    "it is a property of empty space - time . at a very early stage ,",
    "the corresponding vacuum energy was strong and may have driven inflation .",
    "then matter and radiation is created .",
    "assume that the matter and radiation particles are second - quantized by chaotic noise generated by the positive tchebyscheff map ( which generates negative vacuum energy ) .",
    "then , as soon as sufficiently many matter and radiation have been created and quantized , the two vacuum energies @xmath250 and @xmath251 can precisely ( or almost ) cancel , as long as matter and radiation are uniformly distributed in space .",
    "inflation may stop in this way and we obtain a symmetric phase of the universe after inflation .",
    "but at a late stage of the evolution of the universe matter clumps into galaxies .",
    "since the negative vacuum energy is generated by chaotic quantization noise for each particle it follows the spatial distribution of matter .",
    "the positive vacuum energy remains uniformly distributed .",
    "hence after structure formation there is no spatially uniform cancellation of vacuum energy anymore .",
    "empty space has an excess of positive vacuum energy , galaxies are spatial regions with an excess of negative vacuum energy due to quantization noise ( the negative vacuum energy in the galaxy can be partially compensated by positive kinetic terms that arise out of spatial inhomogenities in the galaxy ) . in this physical interpretation",
    "the late - time symmetry breaking is related to structure formation .",
    "we have presented a new model for dark energy in the universe .",
    "this model is based on a rather conservative approach , the assumption of the existence of second quantized self - interacting scalar fields described by a @xmath5-theory",
    ". however , the main difference is that these fields are strongly self - interacting , rather than weakly . when doing 2nd quantization using the parisi - wu approach , rapidly fluctuating chaotic fields arise .",
    "the expectation of the underlying potentials yields the currently observed dark energy density .",
    "the advantage of this new chaotic model is that many of the questions raised in the introduction seem to have natural solutions .",
    "the cosmological constant problem is avoided , in our model the right order of magnitude of vacuum energy is naturally produced if we interpret the chaotic dynamics in terms of vacuum fluctuations allowed by the uncertainty relation , for a given finite age of the universe . the cosmological coincidence problem is also avoided , since in our model the generated dark energy is not constant anymore , but thins out with the expansion of the universe in the same way as the energy density of the dominating species ( matter or radiation ) . in spite of that ,",
    "the ( classical ) equation of state of the chaotic component is close to @xmath6 , and can account for the accelerated expansion of the universe , provided there is late - time symmetry breaking .",
    "the chaotic fields are physically interpreted in terms of vacuum fluctuations . as such they can temporarily violate energy conservation , but quantum mechanical expectations are fully compatible with the friedmann equations .",
    "the physical relevance of our model is emphasized by the observation of a large number of numerical coincidences between local minima in the dark energy landscape and running standard model coupling constants evaluated at the known fermionic and bosonic mass scales .",
    "it thus appears that chaotic fields have the potential to fix and stabilize fundamental parameters and to select the physically relevant vacuum state out of infinitely many possibilities .",
    "our approach can be easily generalized to tchebyscheff maps of arbitrary order @xmath252 .",
    "one has @xmath253 , @xmath254 , @xmath255 , generally @xmath256 with @xmath257 $ ] . a tchebyscheff map of order @xmath252",
    "is conjugated to a bernoulli shift of @xmath252 symbols , it is ergodic and mixing for @xmath258 .",
    "it exhibits the strongest possible chaotic behaviour that is possible for a 1-d smooth map , characterized by a minimum sceleton of higher - order correlations @xcite .",
    "it is useful to consider both positive and negative tchebyscheff maps and to define @xmath259 the behaviour of @xmath260 under iteration is identical to that of @xmath261 up to a sign , the trajectory of @xmath260 differs by a constant sign ( @xmath252 even ) or an alternating sign ( @xmath252 odd ) from that of @xmath261 .",
    "( [ pot ] ) implies that the maps @xmath261 correspond to potentials @xmath262 given by @xmath263 in particular , one obtains for @xmath264 @xmath265 of physical relevance are the expectations of these potentials , formed with respect to the ergodic dynamics .",
    "since negative and positive tchebyscheff maps generate essentially the same dynamics , up to a sign , any physically relevant expecatation should also be the same for @xmath261 and @xmath260 , up to a possible sign . for all @xmath252 ,",
    "this symmetry condition fixes the additive constant to be @xmath266 with this choice one obtains the following formulas for the self energy which are fully symmetric under the transformation @xmath267 : @xmath268 written in terms of the dimensionless field variable @xmath269 this is @xmath270 for tchebyscheff maps of arbitrary order @xmath252 one obtains @xmath271 and @xmath272    for uncoupled tchebyscheff maps with @xmath273 , any expectation of an observable @xmath274 is given by eq .",
    "( [ obs ] ) and ( [ mu ] ) . for @xmath275",
    "the invariant density changes in a nontrivial way , but expectations can still be easily calculated numerically by long - time iteration of the coupled map lattice .",
