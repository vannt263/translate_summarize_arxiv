    "to begin with , let us make a few observation on the solutions to the equations ( i ) in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "first , let us observe that the asymptotics of the solutions @xmath132 to equation ( i ) for @xmath176 is always determined by the `` source term '' @xmath177 as @xmath178 .",
    "this is seen by noting that the kernel @xmath179 of the integral is peaked around @xmath180 , decaying rapidly away from this region .",

    "taking into account the property @xmath181 allows us to conclude that the contribution of the integral in equation ( i ) becomes small when @xmath176 .",
    "this implies that @xmath178 for @xmath176 .",
    "to continue it will be useful to regard equation ( i ) as a fixed point equation of the form @xmath182 for the deviation @xmath183 of @xmath184 from its asymptotics @xmath185 .",
    "the operator @xmath186 is the nonlinear integral operator defined by @xmath187\\,.\\ ] ] we observe in particular that @xmath182 implies that @xmath188 is small of order @xmath189 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath174 is small of the order @xmath189 for @xmath2 up to corrections which are suppressed by further factors of @xmath189 .      turning our attention to the equations @xmath190",
    "we observe that @xmath191 implies that the term which contains @xmath174 will for large @xmath192 be much smaller than the other terms .",
    "we therefore feel tempted to conclude that solutions to the equations @xmath190 will be in one - to - one correspondence to the solutions of the equations which we obtain from @xmath190 by dropping the term which contains @xmath174 .",
    "let us therefore consider the following simplified system of equations : @xmath193 it is sometimes also convenient to consider the exponentiated version of these equations @xmath194    the solutions @xmath106 , @xmath127 are real .",
    "we follow the idea from @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath195 from which it is easily read off that @xmath196 let @xmath197 be the component of @xmath9 $ ] which has maximal imaginary part . by taking the absolute value of both sides of ( [ asbethe ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath198 .",
    "let @xmath199 be the component of @xmath9 $ ] which has minimal imaginary part . in a way that is similar to the previous argument",
    "we infer that @xmath200 .",

    "the lemma implies in particular that @xmath202 , i.e. there are no components @xmath106 in @xmath9 $ ] with @xmath117 .",

    "this is enough to conclude that their presence will not spoil positivity of the matrix of second derivatives , which leads us to the conclusion that existence and uniqueness of the solutions to @xmath167 is ensured if @xmath7 is sufficiently large but still finite .    in similar problems",
    "it is often assumed that @xmath210 if @xmath211 .",
    "it should be stressed that this assumption is not coming from the existence of solutions to the equations ( [ logbethe2 ] ) .",
    "instead it is coming from additional requirements like the existence of wave - functions of a certain form associated to the solutions of equations like ( [ logbethe2 ] ) .",
    "in our case we have shown that all functions @xmath130 correspond to states in the spectrum , and we furthermore argued that for large enough @xmath7 there exist functions @xmath212 corresponding to all tuples @xmath19 $ ] , including those which may have @xmath11 for @xmath211 .      we have seen that to leading order in @xmath189 one gets the spectrum from the solutions of the equations ( [ logbethe2 ] ) of bethe ansatz type .",
    "this can be understood more intuitively as follows .",
    "the interactions between a pair of particles in a massive relativistic quantum field theory like the sinh - gordon model are expected to be relevant mainly if the mutual distance is of the order @xmath213 , with rapid decay when the distance increases further . for small density @xmath214",
    "it should therefore give a reasonable approximation to assume that the motion of the particles is approximately free for most of the time , except if two particles cross each other .",
    "in this case one should be able to describe the crossing of two particles in terms of the two - particle s - matrix . in order to get an approximate description for a state @xmath215 characterized by the rapidities @xmath24 $ ]",
    "one may try to represent it in terms of a coordinate space wave - functions @xmath216 , @xmath217 .",
    "the idea that the motion is free except for two - particle crossings represented by the scattering phase shift @xmath218 leads to the following ansatz for the wave - function @xmath219 , @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the set of all permutations @xmath222 of the elements of @xmath223 , @xmath224 if @xmath225 and zero otherwise , and @xmath226 is defined up to a multiplicative constant by the property that the element @xmath227 which generates an exchange of the elements @xmath228 and @xmath229 of @xmath223 is realized as @xmath230 requiring that the wave - function is periodic w.r.t .",
    "the particle coordinates @xmath231 when @xmath232 then leads to the quantization conditions @xmath233 we see that our bethe ansatz equations ( b ) describe finite volume deviations of order @xmath189 from the asymptotic bethe ansatz equations ( [ asympbethe ] ) .",
    "we will now see that our proposal for the spectrum of the sinh - gordon model seems to lead to a rather nice picture of its uv limit .",
    "some qualitative and quantitative aspects of this picture will be found to be in remarkable agreement with certain predictions that follow from the expected relationship with liouville theory @xcite .",
    "we would like to argue that the solutions @xmath9 $ ] of equations ( i ) and ( b ) have the following behavior for @xmath15 , @xmath234 this means that the particles with @xmath235 or @xmath236 are moving to the right or to the left with velocity close to the speed of light , respectively .",
    "the separations @xmath237 within each cluster are of the order one in comparison with @xmath238 .    in order to see this ,",
