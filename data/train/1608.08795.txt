    "this is called unitary fermi gas and corresponds a novel type of superfluid with neither dominant bosonic nor fermionic character .",
    "this new superfluid has already been intensively investigated @xcite , leading to several milestone observations .",
    "theoretical challenges in describing the bcs - bec crossover arise from its strongly correlated nature : there is no small interaction parameter to control the accuracy of theories @xcite . to date , significant progress has been made in developing better quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations @xcite and strong - coupling theories @xcite , leading to the quantitative establishment of a number of properties in conjunction with the rapid experimental advances .",
    "these include the equation of state @xcite , frequency of collective oscillations @xcite , pairing gap @xcite , and superfluid transition temperature @xcite .",
    "however , some fundamental dynamical properties , such as the single - particle spectral function measured by radio - frequency ( rf ) spectroscopy @xcite and the dynamic structure factor probed by bragg spectroscopy @xcite , are not well understood yet .    as an important fingerprint of quantum gases in some certain states ,",
    "dynamic structure factor contains rich information of properties of a many - body system @xcite . by tuning the transferred momentum or energy from a low value to a high one",
    ", we can observe the low - lying collective phonon excitations , cooper - pair ( i.e. , molecular ) excitations and single - particle atomic excitations , respectively .",
    "in particular , at finite temperature the dynamic structure factor can help to judge whether the system is in the superfluid or normal state from the emergence of the phonon excitations . also , it is reasonable to anticipate that the dynamic structure factor may play a role to solve the debate on the existence of pseudogap pairing or pre - pairing states @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the dynamic structure factor can be measured via two - photon bragg scattering technique @xcite , at both low and finite temperatures @xcite . theoretically , since no exact solution exists for strongly interacting fermi gases and the numerically exact qmc approach is less efficient for simulating dynamical quantities",
    ", one has to resort to some approximated approaches , which are useful in certain limiting cases @xcite ( see table i ) .",
    "for example , at high temperature , as the fugacity is a small parameter , a quantum cluster expansion has been proven to be an efficient method @xcite , and has been used to calculate the dynamic structure factor @xcite . in the limits of both large momentum and high frequency ,",

    "the expressions for the density and spin responses of strongly interacting fermi gases have been obtained @xcite . however , their numerical calculations turn out to be extremely difficult , except in the limit of zero transferred momentum @xcite .",
    "a more commonly used approach is the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) on top of the mean - field bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) theory @xcite . by comparing the bdg - rpa predictions with the experimental data for the dynamic structure factor of strongly interacting fermions and with the qmc results for the static structure factor @xcite ,",

    "the slda theory assumes an energy density functional ( i.e. , a function of the density function ) to describe a unitary fermi superfluid and uses the qmc results for the chemical potential and order parameter as two important inputs .",

    "the use of slda in place of the standard bdg equations improves the predictions for the dynamic structure factor in the bcs - bec crossover near unitarity .",

    ", we set @xmath14 in the following discussions .",
    "the density functional theory ( dft ) developed by hohenberg and kohn @xcite , together with the local density approximation ( lda ) by kohn and sham @xcite , is a powerful tool to understand the properties of many - electron systems .",
    "the dft was initially used for electrons in the normal , non - superconducting state .",
    "it is based on the assumptions that there is a unique mapping between the external potential and the total wave function of the system ( or the normal density ) , and that the exact energy of the system can be written as a density functional .",
    "a limitation of the dft is that the exact form of the density functional is often not known .",
    "therefore , approximated phenomenological functionals are introduced , which should be optimized for a specific system .",
    "typically , those functionals rely on the kohn - sham orbitals @xcite and thus can not effectively deal with superfluidity .",
    "the generalization of the dft to superfluid cold - atom systems - referred to as slda as we mentioned earlier - was recently introduced by bulgac and yu @xcite .",
    "this slda originates from a similar dft previously used in the context of nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "a nice feature of ultracold fermions is that , in the unitary limit the form of the energy density functional is restricted by dimensional arguments .",
    "another advantage is the availability of _ ab - initio _ qmc results and accurate experimental data for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems , which can be used to fix the parameters of the density functional , as we shall see below .    for a superfluid atomic fermi gas , two atoms with mass @xmath15 in different spin state can form a cooper pair . as a result",

    "three dimensionless constants , the effective mass parameter @xmath28 , hartree parameter @xmath29 and pairing parameter @xmath30 , are introduced .",
    "these parameters are determined by requiring that the slda reproduces exactly the _ zero temperature _ chemical potential , pairing gap and energy per particle that are obtained by either qmc simulations or accurate experimental measurements for a uniform system @xcite .    in the unitary limit at zero temperature , the simple form of the energy density functional eq .",

    "if a superfluid fermi gas is perturbed by a small external potential , usually the number density and anomalous density will fluctuate . due to the interatomic interactions",
    ", the fluctuating densities will feedback and induce an additional perturbation potential .",
    "one way to include these fluctuation effects is to use the linear response theory within the rpa @xcite .",
    "the essential idea of rpa is that the induced fluctuation potential is assumed to be a _ self - generated _ mean - field potential experienced by quasiparticles , due to the local changes in the number densities @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and cooper - pairs density @xmath16 or its complex conjugate @xmath73 . in the following , for convenience , we denote these four densities @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath23 and @xmath76 as @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .    in the slda energy density functional , it is easy to see that the interaction contribution to the functional is given by , @xmath81",
