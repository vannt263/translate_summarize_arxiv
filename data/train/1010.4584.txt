    "next generation lasers such as eli @xcite and vulcan @xcite are expected to achieve intensities of @xmath0 or greater , opening up rich opportunities to study qed processes in the strong field regime@xcite .",
    "one of these processes is pair production in counter - propagating beams , which is a significant effect at @xmath1@xcite , and , at @xmath2 is sufficiently strong that a cascade may develop in which each electron produces a pair that in turn produces further pairs , to initiate an avalanche .    in intense laser beams ,",
    "the dominant route to pair production is a two - stage process .",
    "firstly , an electron with lorentz factor @xmath3 interacts with the laser fields ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) to produce a gamma - ray with high energy @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , the gamma - ray interacts with the same fields as it propagates to produce an electron - positron pair @xcite .",
    "the crucial parameters for the two - stage process are ( i ) @xmath7 , a precise definition is given in ( [ etachidef ] ) ] where @xmath8 is the schwinger field , and ( ii ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gamma - ray momentum and @xmath11 is the component of the electric field perpendicular to the direction of motion of the electron or photon , as appropriate .",
    "strong field qed effects such as pair production become important when these parameters reach unity .",
    "the energy of the gamma - ray photon is typically @xmath12 , implying @xmath13 , and the cross - section for pair production is proportional to @xmath14 for @xmath15 . because of the exponential cut - off to the cross - section , the process is very sensitive to the value of @xmath16 reached by the electron , when the regime of strong qed is approached .",
    "this leads to an abrupt laser - intensity threshold for pair production as noted by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where a small increase in @xmath16 can lead to a large increase in pair production .    in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a semi - classical treatment was used in which electrons were subject to a continuous loss of energy through radiation of gamma - rays . in this continuous model ,",
    "the radiation reaction force is approximated , to the lowest order in @xmath17 , by the expression @xmath18 where @xmath19 $ ] accounts for the reduction of the total power radiated by the electron .",
    "@xmath20 is the quantum synchrotron emissivity , as defined in appendix  a of @xcite .",
    "however , in reality , gamma - ray emission is a random quantum process @xcite .",
    "as @xmath16 approaches unity , the energy of the emitted gamma - ray becomes a substantial fraction , typically @xmath21 , of the kinetic energy of the electron before emission , and the resulting electron trajectory starts to fluctuate substantially away from the semi - classical average .",
    "this enhances pair production in two ways .",
    "firstly , if an accelerating electron propagates by chance over an unusually large distance before emitting a gamma - ray , it may reach a large lorentz factor @xmath3 and emit a gamma - ray with an unusually high energy .",
    "this , in turn , has a much increased probability of producing a pair , as compared to the photons emitted by an electron moving on a classical trajectory in the same field .",
    "such events cumulate , and we show in [ strag ] that this straggling effect @xcite enhances pair production . secondly , the deviations in the trajectory caused by straggling lead the electron to sample the laser fields at locations other than those on the classical path . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that , under the influence of continuous radiation losses , electrons naturally migrate towards points in the laser field at which they emit few high - energy gamma - rays . in the case of counter - propagating circularly polarised waves ,",
    "these are the nodes in the electric field .",
    "once an electron settles at an @xmath22 node , its lorentz factor drops and pair production ceases .",
    "in contrast , we show in [ offnode ] that straggling causes electrons to migrate more slowly towards these nodes .",
    "consequently , electrons undergoing discontinuous momentum changes retain a large lorentz factor for longer than their semi - classical counterparts , and emit a larger number of high energy gamma - rays , which subsequently produce more pairs .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the calculations of @xcite and @xcite by modelling radiation loss as a discontinuous process that leads to straggling effects on the electron trajectory .",
    "this is done using a monte - carlo method that is described in section  [ mcalgo ] . in section [ comparmc ]",
    ", we compare the continuous with the more realistic discontinuous loss case , and show that the latter produces a larger number of pairs at laser intensities around @xmath23 .",
    "pair production at @xmath2 is relatively little affected by straggling since , at this intensity , even semi - classical , continuous electron trajectories lead to gamma - rays that are well over the threshold for pair production .",
    "in 4-vector notation , the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath24 are defined as @xmath25 for an electron and photon whose four - momenta are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , with @xmath28 the electromagnetic field tensor . in the following , we make use of the approach presented in @xcite , that retains the weak , quasi - stationary field approximation . the probabilities for gamma - ray photon emission and the subsequent pair production are in this approximation functions of @xmath16 and @xmath24 only .",
    "an equivalent system is then chosen , for the same given @xmath24 and @xmath16 , in which the electron moves in a plane perpendicular to a uniform , static @xmath29 field .",
    "this allows us to use the transition probabilities as formulated in @xcite .    the radiation emitted by the particle due to its acceleration in the laser fields  here called synchrotron radiation",
    " is assumed to be a random walk process @xcite .",
    "the probability of emission of a gamma - ray photon is governed by an optical depth @xmath30 . at the start of the calculation , and immediately following the emission of a photon , the current optical depth @xmath30 is set to zero and a randomly chosen final  optical depth @xmath31 is assigned to the electron .",
    "the current optical depth @xmath30 increases as the electron propagates until it reaches @xmath31 , at which point a photon is emitted . at each computational timestep the electron s position , momentum and current optical depth are updated according to the equations @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the differential rate of production of photons of parameter @xmath24 by an electron of parameter @xmath16 and @xmath20 is the quantum synchrotron emissivity , expressed in the weak , quasi - stationary field approximation @xcite .",
    "an expression for @xmath20 is given in appendix  a of @xcite .",
    "the compton time is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the compton wavelength , and @xmath36 is the fine structure constant .",
    "when @xmath37 is reached , a photon is emitted , and its energy is randomly assigned as follows .",
    "first , the parameter @xmath38 is found from the relation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a uniformly distributed random number in [ 0,1 ] , and the right hand side is a monotonic , increasing function of @xmath41 , which is tabulated in both the @xmath41 and @xmath16 directions .",
    "the variables @xmath41 and @xmath16 , in equation ( [ phenergysample ] ) , depend on the electromagnetic field at the point of photon emission . then , assuming that the photon is emitted parallel to the electron momentum , its energy @xmath42 , is determined by the relation @xmath43 which follows from the definitions of @xmath16 and @xmath24 and the assumption that the electron is relativistic , @xmath44 . for computational efficiency",
    ", we ignore the rare photons emitted in the low energy part of the spectrum , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is chosen such that the neglected photons carry only @xmath47 of the total energy and are incapable of producing pairs .",
    "the computational procedure was successfully tested by its ability to reproduce the correct synchrotron spectrum .",
    "this is shown in fig.[convf ] , for a large number ( @xmath48 ) of emitted photons in a regime where @xmath49 .",
    "a @xmath50 parameter , which represents the photon energy , is assigned to each photon at the emission point , according to the sampling relation ( [ phenergysample ] ) .",
    "the occurrence ( in percent of the total number of the @xmath48 emission events ) of emissions in each energy interval gives a distribution along the @xmath50 axis , that scales with the quantum synchrotron emissivity @xmath51 .",
    "resulting from the sampling relation ( [ phenergysample ] ) and the quantum synchrotron emissivity @xmath51 . ]",
    "after the electron has emitted a photon , which is assumed to occur instantaneously , it continues its trajectory beginning at the same point but with a different energy @xmath52 and momentum @xmath53 . to find @xmath54",
    ", we again use the approximation that the photon is emitted parallel to the pre - emission electron momentum , so that , by conservation of momentum , @xmath55 in reality , the photon may be emitted over a cone of opening angle approximately @xmath17 , but we neglect this small angular spread here .",
    "equation ( [ pchange ] ) implies that a small amount of energy is extracted from the laser fields during photon emission , which we also neglect .",
    "this neglect is unimportant in the present test - particle model in which the laser fields are prescribed , since the fraction of the electron energy transferred to the laser field is small @xmath56 , as shown in [ appendixa ] .",
    "however this point may need more careful treatment in a more complete dynamic treatment of the development of an electron - positron cascade and its inclusion in a particle - in - cell code @xcite .",
    "as in @xcite , we adopt the configuration of two counter - streaming , circularly polarized laser beams , which can qualitatively be considered equivalent to the interaction of an incident and reflected beam from a solid @xcite . we restrict the treatment to pair creation by the two - step process described in section [ mcalgo ] .",
    "pairs can also be produced directly by an electron interacting with the laser field , without the need to produce an intermediate real photon .",
    "this process is analogous to trident pair production by an electron in the coulomb field of a nucleus .",
    "however , although this direct , single - step process may be important at lower laser intensity , it is dominated by the indirect two - step process at laser intensities above @xmath57 , and we do not include it in the results presented here .    in the two - step process , the emitted gamma - rays travel through the plasma and may produce pairs according to the cross - section which depends on @xmath24 . in many ways ,",
    "the process is comparable with that of gamma - ray production by electrons .",
    "the photon trajectory could be followed through the electromagnetic fields and the optical depth integrated as for electrons .",
    "however , in order to make a direct comparison with the rate computed assuming continuous losses , we here follow the much simpler approximate approach that was used in @xcite .",
    "the probability of pair production is calculated for a gamma - ray with @xmath58 , that propagates through electromagnetic fields that are assumed to equal those at the point where the gamma - ray was emitted .",
    "we follow @xcite and make the assumption that conversion into pairs can occur until the photon has propagated a distance of one laser wavelength . here",
    "the approximation is that the beams have a transverse structure with cylindrical geometry , whose radius is one wavelength , representative of beams which are tightly focussed at the diffraction limit to achieve maximum laser intensity .",
    "the real photons only produce pairs while they propagate through the region of large laser field .",
    "in contrast to electrons , whose trajectory is determined by the electromagnetic fields , the photons are undeflected .",
    "this means that all along its path through the laser fields , the value of the parameter @xmath24 remains unchanged at @xmath58 .",
    "further details can be found in section 3.3 of @xcite .",
    "the differential pair production rate _ via _ real photons is the product of the differential rate for real photon emission , @xmath59 , and an effective conversion probability into pairs , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is an effective optical depth to pair conversion .",
    "the rate of pair production _ via _ real photons per electron is then addressed with the same rate equation as in @xcite @xmath62      in this section , we select a particular trajectory at a @xmath64 node ( zero magnetic field ) of an infinite standing wave generated by two counter - propagating , circularly polarized laser beams with the same sense of rotation of the fields . throughout",
    ", distances and times are scaled with the laser wavelength and laser period , respectively .",
    "this configuration has been extensively analysed in @xcite in the case of continuous radiation losses where it was shown that the electron settles into a circular orbit , which is favourable for pair production . here",
    "we show how discontinuous trajectories increase pair production .",
    "the two beams counter - propagate along the @xmath65-axis , each with an intensity @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "the electron is initially located at a @xmath64 node in the standing wave formed by the counter - propagating beams .",
    "its initial lorentz factor is @xmath68 , with its momentum oriented along the positive @xmath69-axis .",
    "the electron motion is tracked over seven laser periods during which it remains at the magnetic node . in fig .",
    "[ structure](a ) , the discontinuous monte carlo calculations lead to the straggling of the lorentz factor for the particle ( green curve ) .",
    "this is compared with the lorentz factor of a particle that undergoes continuous radiation loss , computed as in @xcite ( red curve ) for the same initial conditions .",
    "a feature of the straggling in this regime is a @xmath70 fluctuation about the lorentz factor derived from the continuous description . the particle motion , as shown in fig .",
    "[ structure](b ) is characterized by excursions to higher and lower @xmath16 values than those reached by an electron undergoing continuous losses .",
    "the discrepancies in the particle @xmath69 position , between the two descriptions , is also shown in fig .",
    "[ structure](b ) . finally , the comparison of fig .",
    "[ pairs ] , and fig .",
    "[ structure](b ) , shows that the high @xmath16 excursions are very effective at producing pairs .",
    "moreover , the accumulation of pairs , produced by the high @xmath16 excursions , leads to an enhancement of the overall pair production , in this example by about @xmath71 after only seven laser periods . at this time",
    ", the average number of pairs produces by an electron reaches unity , which can be considered an approximate threshold for the initiation of an electron - positron avalanche .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we report on calculations of the number of electron positron pairs produced as an electron moves in the field of a laser with intensity in the range range @xmath72 . in this regime , the dominant route to pair production involves the emission of gamma - ray photons _ via _ synchrotron radiation , and their further conversion into electron - positron pairs @xcite .",
    "the new aspect of our treatment is that we take account of the stochastic nature of gamma - ray production , which leads to discontinuous quantum jumps in the electron energy ; using a monte - carlo algorithm we follow the evolution of a large number of stochastic trajectories that result from each individual set of initial conditions .",
    "pair production has been shown to be important in configurations with counter - propagating laser beams , that can be generalized to apply to laser - solid interactions @xcite .",
    "however , these authors used a continuous approximation for the radiation reaction force , and examined , therefore , one classical trajectory for each set of initial conditions . in order to make a direct comparison with our calculations , we investigate a specific , highly idealized configuration of the laser fields that was also used as a test - case by @xcite : that of two long , counterpropagating , circularly polarized laser pulses .    discontinuous , stochastic jumps in the electron energy give rise to a spread in energy as a function of time known as _",
    "straggling_. our main result is that straggling increases the number of pairs produced for given initial conditions , and for a given laser intensity .",
    "this behaviour is more pronounced for laser intensities less than @xmath73 where the transition probabilities are strongly dependent on @xmath16 and @xmath24 ; in this range we observe up to a fivefold increase in the number of pairs produced .",
    "straggling effects are less important at higher intensities , where most gamma - rays are above threshold for pair production and the number of electron - positron pairs produced is large .",
    "two effects contribute to the increase in pair production due to straggling .",
    "firstly , the value of the electron s @xmath16-parameter , which controls the energy of the emitted gamma - ray , varies considerably about its mean .",
    "occasional excursions to large @xmath16 result in the emission of higher energy gamma - rays with a correspondingly larger probability of producing pairs . secondly , straggling increases , on average , the time taken for electrons to congregate in a region where few pairs can be created ( a node with @xmath22 in our calculations ) , and this extends the time during which high - energy photons are emitted and pairs produced .",
    "we conclude that straggling lowers the laser intensity required for significant pair production .    in realistic situations ,",
    "when large numbers of pairs are produced , their mutual interactions as well as their back - reaction on the accelerating fields must be taken into account . in an astrophysical setting",
    ", @xcite has addressed this problem by combining a monte - carlo algorithm with a pic - code .",
    "we envisage that the monte carlo algorithm we present will serve as a basis for a coupled monte carlo - pic algorithm aimed at modelling the initiation of prolific pair - plasma creation in intense laser fields .",
