    "uncovering rules governing collective human behavior is a difficult task because of the myriad of factors that influence an individual s decision to take action .",
    "investigations into the timing of individual activity , as a basis for understanding more complex collective behavior , have reported statistical evidence that human actions range from random @xcite to highly correlated @xcite . while most of the time the aggregated dynamics of our individual activities create seasonal trends or simple patterns , sometimes our collective action results in blockbusters , best - sellers , and other large - scale trends in financial and cultural markets .    here , we attempt to understand this nontrivial herding by investigating how the distribution of waiting times describing individuals activity @xcite is modified by the combination of interactions @xcite and external influences in a social network .",
    "this is achieved by measuring the response function of a social system @xcite and distinguishing whether a burst of activity was the result of a cumulative effect of small endogenous factors or instead the response to a large exogenous perturbation .",
    "looking for endogenous and exogenous signatures in complex systems provides a useful framework for understanding many complex systems and has been successfully applied in several other contexts @xcite .    as an illustration of this distinction in a social system ,",
    "consider the example of trends in queries on internet search engines @xcite in figure [ fig : google ] , which shows the remarkable differences in the dynamic response of a social network to major social events .",
    "for the `` exogenous '' catastrophic asian tsunami of december 26th , 2004 , we see the social network responded suddenly . in contrast , the search activity surrounding the release of a harry potter movie has the more `` endogenous '' signature generated by word - of - mouth , with significant precursory growth and an almost symmetric decay of interest after the release . in both `` endo '' and `` exo '' cases",
    "there is a significant burst of activity .",
    "however , we expect to be able to distinguish the post - peak relaxation dynamics on account of the very different processes that resulted in the bursts .",
    "furthermore , we expect the relaxation process to depend on the interest of the population since this will influence the ease with which the activity can be spread from generation to generation .    to translate this qualitative distinction into quantitative results , we describe a model of epidemic spreading on a social network @xcite and validate it with a data set that is naturally structured to facilitate the separation of this endo / exo dichotomy . our data consists of nearly 5 million time - series of human activity collected sub - daily over 8 months from the 4th most visited web site ( youtube ) .",
    "at the simplest level , viewing activity can occur one of three ways : randomly , exogenously ( when a video is featured ) , or endogenously ( when a video is shared ) .",
    "this provides us with a natural laboratory for distinguishing the effects that various impacts have and allows us to measure the social `` response function '' .",
    "various factors may lead to viewing a video , which include chance , triggering from email , linking from external websites , discussion on blogs , newspapers , and television , and from social influences .",
    "the epidemic model we apply to the dynamics of viewing behavior on youtube uses two ingredients whose interplay capture these effects .",
    "the first ingredient is a power law distribution of waiting times describing human activity @xcite that expresses the latent impact of these various factors using a response function which , on the basis of previous work @xcite , we take to be a long - memory process of the form @xmath0 by definition , the memory kernel @xmath1 describes the distribution of waiting times between `` cause '' and `` action '' for an individual .",
    "the `` cause '' can be any of the above mentioned factors .",
    "the action is for the individual to view the video in question after a time @xmath2 since she was first subjected to the `` cause '' _ without _ any other influences between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , corresponding to a direct ( or first - generation ) effect . in other words , @xmath1 is the `` bare '' memory kernel or propagator , describing the direct influence of a factor that triggers the individual to view the video in question . here , the exponent @xmath4 is the key parameter of the theory which will be determined empirically from the data .",
    "the second ingredient is an epidemic branching process that describes the cascade of influences on the social network .",
    "this process captures how previous attention from one individual can spread to others and become the cause that triggers their future attention @xcite . in a highly connected network of individuals",
    "whose interests make them susceptible to the given video content , a given factor may trigger action through a cascade of intermediate steps .",
    "such an epidemic process can be conveniently modeled by the so - called self - excited hawkes conditional poisson process @xcite .",
    "this gives the instantaneous rate of views @xmath5 as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of potential viewers who will be influenced directly over all future times after @xmath8 by person @xmath9 who viewed a video at time @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the existence of well - connected individuals can be accounted for with large values of @xmath7 .",
    "lastly , @xmath10 is the exogenous source , which captures all spontaneous views that are not triggered by epidemic effects on the network .      according to our model",
    ", the aggregated dynamics can be classified by a combination of the type of disturbance ( endo / exo ) and the ability of individuals to influence others to action ( critical / sub - critical ) , all of which is linked by a common value of @xmath4 .",
    "the following classification of behaviors emerges from the interplay of the bare long - memory kernel @xmath1 given by ( [ eq : memorybare ] ) and the epidemic influences across the network modeled by the hawkes process ( [ eq : intensity ] )    * * exogenous sub - critical*. when the network is not `` ripe '' ( that is , when connectivity and spreading propensity are relatively small ) , corresponding to the case when the mean value @xmath11 of @xmath7 is less than @xmath12 , then the activity generated by an exogenous event at time @xmath13 does not cascade beyond the first few generations , and the activity is proportional to the direct ( or `` bare '' ) memory function @xmath14 : @xmath15 * * exogenous critical*. if instead the network is `` ripe '' for a particular video , i.e. , @xmath11 is close to 1 , then the bare response is renormalized as the spreading is propagated through many generations of viewers influencing viewers influencing viewers , and the theory predicts the activity to be described by @xcite : @xmath16 * * endogenous critical*. if in addition to being `` ripe '' , the burst of activity is not the result of an exogenous event , but is instead fueled by endogenous ( word - of - mouth ) growth , the bare response is renormalized giving the following time - dependence for the view count before and after the peak of activity @xcite : @xmath17 * * endogenous sub - critical*. here the response is largely driven by fluctuations , and not bursts of activity .",
    "we expect that many time - series in this class will obey a simple stochastic process . @xmath18",
    "the dynamics described by the above classifications are illustrated in figure [ fig : predictions ] .",
    "in addition to these classes , the model predicts , by construction , a relationship between the fraction of views obtained on the peak day compared to the total cumulative views ( figure [ fig : predictions ] : inset ) . for",
    "the * exogenous sub - critical * class , the absence of precursory growth and fast relaxation following a peak imply that close to 100% of the views are contained in the peak .",
    "for the * exogenous critical * class , the fractional views in the peak should be smaller than the previous case on account of the content penetrating the network resulting in a slower relaxation .",
    "finally , for the * endogenous critical * class , significant precursory growth followed by a slow decay imply that the fractional weight of this peak is very small compared to the total view count .",
    "this simple observation will be used as the basis for grouping exponents .",
    "we find that most videos dynamics ( @xmath19% ) either do not experience much activity or can be statistically described as a random process ( using a poisson process and chi - squared test ) .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the endo - subcritical classification .",
    "for the other 10% ( @xmath20 videos ) we find nontrivial herding behavior which accurately obeys the three power - law relations described above .",
    "characteristic examples of endogenous and exogenous dynamics are shown in figure [ fig : endoexo ] .",
    "for these videos that experience bursts , we calculate the fraction @xmath21 of views on the most active day compared to the total count , and define three classes :    1 .",
    "class 1 is defined by @xmath22 .",
    "class 2 is defined by @xmath23 .",
    "class 3 is defined by @xmath24 .",
    "should our model have any informative power , we should find a correspondence @xmath25 based on this simple classification , we show in figure [ fig : histogram ] the histogram of exponents characterizing the power law relaxation @xmath26 .",
    "the exponents in the various classes cluster into groups with the most probable exponent in each class given respectively by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "these results are robust with respect to changes of the threshold percentages .",
    "these values are compatible with the predictions ( [ eq : bare ] ) , ( [ eq : exc ] ) , ( [ eq : enc ] ) of the epidemic model with a unique value of @xmath30 .",
    "having empirically extracted a value of @xmath4 , a further test of the model is provided by asking if the dynamics of videos with these exponents are consistent with the description of the model . here",
    ", the test of the epidemic model lies in the precursory dynamics .",
    "we check this by performing a peak - centered , aggregate sum for all videos with exponents near either 1.4 , 0.6 , or 0.2 , with the intent of visualizing the time evolution .",
    "each time - series is first normalized to 1 to avoid a single video from dominating the sum , and the final result is divided by the number of videos in each set so we can compare the three classes .",
    "the model predicts , and we indeed observe in figure [ fig : aggregate ] , that videos whose post - peak dynamics is governed by small exponents have significantly more precursory growth .",
    "one also sees very little precursory growth for the two exogenous classes .",
    "since by construction our grouping was based on the exponent characterizing the relaxation after the peak , one is not surprised to visualize faster decays for those videos with exponents near 1.4 compared with those of 0.6 and 0.2 .",
    "these results provide direct evidence that collective human dynamics can be robustly classified by epidemic models , and understood as the transformation of the distribution of individual waiting times by exogenous and endogenous forces .",
    "one of the surprising results is that the various classes are related by a common value of @xmath4 .",
    "while it is not expected that @xmath4 is universal in human systems , it is similar to what has been found in other studies @xcite .",
    "this provides a possible measure of the strength of interactions in a social network , and will be the subject of future work .",
    "in addition to these results , understanding collective human dynamics opens the possibility for a number of tantalizing applications .",
    "it is natural to suggest a qualitative labeling that is quantitatively consistent with the three classes derived from the model : viral , quality , and junk videos .",
    "viral videos are those with precursory word - of - mouth growth resulting from epidemic - like propagation through a social network and correspond to the endogenous critical class with an exponent ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "quality videos are similar to viral videos but experience a sudden burst of activity rather than a bottom - up growth . because of the `` quality '' of their content they subsequently trigger an epidemic cascade through the social network .",
    "these correspond to the exogenous critical class , relaxing with an exponent ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "lastly , junk videos are those that experience a burst of activity for some reason ( spam , chance , etc ) but do not spread through the social network . therefore their activity is determined largely by the first - generation of viewers , corresponding to the exogenous sub - critical class , and they should relax as ( @xmath33 ) . while one might argue that these labels are inherently subjective",
    ", they reflect the objective measure contained in the collective response to events and information .",
    "this is further supported by the average number of total views in each class , which is largest for `` viral '' ( 33,693 views ) and smallest for `` junk '' ( 16,524 views ) as one would expect .",
    "while the above description applies to videos , one could extend this technique to the realm of books @xcite , movies , and other commercial products , perhaps using sales as a proxy for measuring the relaxation of individual activity . the proposed method for classifying content",
    "has the important advantage of robustness as it does not rely on qualitative judgment , using information revealed by the dynamics of the human activity as the referee .",
    "more importantly , the method does not rely on the magnitude of the response because of the scale free nature of the relaxation dynamics .",
    "this implies that identification of relevance  or lack of relevance  can be made for content that has mass - appeal , along with that which appeals to more specialized communities .",
    "furthermore , this framework could be used to provide a quantitative measure of the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by measuring the sales response to an `` exogenous '' marketing event .",
    "a tenant of complex systems theory is that many seemingly disparate and unrelated systems actually share an underlying universal behavior . in the digital age",
    ", we now have access to unprecedented stores of data on human activity .",
    "this data is usually almost trivial to acquire  in both time and money  when compared with traditional measurements .",
    "if the complex behavior in social systems is shared by other complex systems , then our approach , which disentangles the individual response from the collective , may provide a useful framework for the study of their dynamics ."
