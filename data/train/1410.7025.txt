    "naturalness arguments suggest that if supersymmetry ( susy ) provides a solution to the hierarchy problem , then the supersymmetric partner of the top quark , the stop ( ) , should be relatively light .",

    "exploiting precision measurements of the @xmath2  cross - section is due in part to the nnlo+nnll precision  @xcite that reduces the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath3 to about 5% , which is sensitive to the @xmath5 contribution of a degenerate stop .",

    "for example , a stop with @xmath61  that decays via the three - body decay together with a true top quark mass of about @xmath62  would cause a bias in the top quark mass that makes it compatible with the measurements at the lhc8 . as a consequence ,",
    "the predicted @xmath2  cross - section would be over - estimated by about @xmath63pb which in turn would make it much harder to find the stop with a cross - section of about @xmath64pb ( which is further reduced to about @xmath65% since the acceptance is lower than for @xmath2 ) .",

    "is currently precluded on precision grounds .  or so .",
    "]    we have performed several additional checks to see how the results depend on the various method choices .",
    "first , we have considered the dependance of the three - body bias on the stop and neutralino masses . for fixed neutralino mass and lower",
    "stop mass , the distribution of @xmath8 shifts to lower values and the stop cross section increases , hence the bias increases ( regulated by a small drop in acceptance due to softer @xmath45 spectra ) . for fixed @xmath70 ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath8 is roughly unchanged , but the bias can increase or decrease depending on the stop mass . in particular , one could solve the following equations to find stop , neutralino , and top masses that are consistent with the measured values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] .",
    "@xmath71    where @xmath72 is the ratio of the susy acceptance to the @xmath2 acceptance and @xmath73 are the slope and intercept from the calibration curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : mjjj ] , respectively .",
    "one can approximate @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the nominal stop mass of @xmath76  is already close to the optimal ` hiding ' point for the sneak stop , but the agreement with the measurement can be further improved by slightly increasing the stop mass for the assumed stop - neutralino mass difference .",
    "two other additional checks are related to the theoretical an experimental modeling .",
    "we have verified that the same qualitative shift in the @xmath8 distribution is observed when using a matrix element calculated with madgraph  @xcite at leading order interfaced with herwig++ for the parton shower and hadronization .",
    "we further checked that changing the experimental top mass measurement procedure does not qualitatively change the results .",
    "using the more sophisticated fit with a line - shape function described in section  [ sec : method ] instead of @xmath59 , we still observe a significant bias for the three - body decays , though it is reduced by about @xmath5 depending on parameters .",
    "the actual bias in the top quark mass needs to be determined using proper top quark mass analyses and detector simulation .",
    "if the findings of this article are confirmed then analyses relying on the predicted @xmath2  cross - section that set exclusion limits on a light stop decaying via the three - body process need to take this effect into account .",
    "the exclusion limits in the recent atlas results in refs .",
    "@xcite are robust against this effect since only the stop two - body decay mode is considered for which we find no significant bias . the spin correlation measurement should retain its sensitivity to a stop also for the three - body decay mode .",
