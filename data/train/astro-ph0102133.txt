    "clusters of galaxies are key cosmological probes .",
    "they are one of the main products of the hierarchical models and the largest virialized structures in the universe .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. navarro et al . 1997 ) argue that whatever the cosmological model , a universal profile ( nfw profile ) with a cusp at the center should describe the cluster dark matter profile , in contrast to the beta - model ( king 1962 ) which has been used from many years ( cf sarazin 1986 ) .",
    "the shape of the galaxy number and luminosity density profiles ( and their dependence on redshift ) relates directly to the physical processes acting at the center of the clusters and we propose to investigate in this way these processes . while the dark matter profile ( close to the total mass profile ) seems to be very concentrated ( navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) , the galaxy distribution is nearly flat in the center of the nearby clusters ( adami et al . 1998 : enacsvii ) .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray gas distribution can not be used to distinguish between a flat and a cusped model except for the nearby clusters ( e.g. durret et al . 1994 ) due to a lack of resolution with rosat , einstein and asca and due to cooling - flows .    in this paper",
    "we contribute to the effort to solve this puzzle by studying the galaxy number density profile and the galaxy luminosity density profile ( the sum of the luminosity inside the galaxies ; we will consider the diffuse light only at the end of the paper ) .",
    "this approach is clearly not new ( e.g. mazure et al .",
    "1986 ) , but we used here very large , homegeneously analyzed , samples .",
    "the use of all the optical wave band galaxy light allows us to take into account merging events .",
    "this method enables us to recover `` erased '' cusps as it is the light of merged galaxies which is counted , not the number of galaxies .",
    "the best way to investigate the mass profile would be to compute this profile via the velocity dispersion profile ( e.g. carlberg et al .",
    "1997a and b , biviano et al .",
    "2001 ) , the x - ray temperature profile , or gravitational lensing , but these techniques require large amounts of data , and therefore , it is very difficult to obtain large samples of clusters .",
    "moreover , galaxy luminosity density profiles for early type galaxies are claimed ( e.g. kaiser 1999 ) to be similar to the mass profile in clusters .",
    "this is an important question as galaxies would be sufficient to trace the mass profile .",
    "we will use in this paper homogeneous samples of thousands of galaxies and tens of clusters to compare the projected galaxy number density and luminosity profiles , and the simulated dark matter profiles ( e.g. navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the samples . in sections 3 and 4",
    ", we describe the methods we used and the profiles we generated .",
    "section 5 discusses the results and section 6 gives a summary of the results .    to relate values of z to distance and to be in agreement with adami et al .",
    "( 1998 , enacsvii ) , we have taken h@xmath2 = 100 km.s@xmath3mpc@xmath3 , q@xmath2 = 0 and @xmath4 .",
    "we used the cosmos composite cluster which is decribed in detail in enacsvii , but we briefly enumerate the main points here : we compiled photometric cosmos data ( heydon - dumbleton et al .",
    "1989 ) for 77 of the 107 enacs clusters ( z@xmath50.1 ) .",
    "we have adopted a limiting magnitude of @xmath6 = 20 .",
    "we have selected the clusters with :    1 .",
    "a low level of substructure ( both visually and with a dressler - shectman test ) in a 10 core radii on a side square ( @xmath01200 kpc h@xmath3 ) , with more than 10 known redshifts in the main group ( to avoid superposition effects ) ; 2 .",
    "a redshift lower than 0.1 3 .   and a converging solution of the fit of analytical density profiles .",
    "these selection criteria lead to a sample of 29 homogeneously selected clusters . with this sample",
    "we built a composite cluster with about 5000 galaxies .",
    "for each of the 29 clusters , we determined the center by a maximum likelihood fit and we confirmed the results with other estimators ( x - ray centers , cd galaxies , see also ulmer et al .",
    "1992 ) . for each galaxy ,",
    "the distance from the center has been scaled both with the core radius of the cluster and the r@xmath7 ( radius where the density is equal to 200 times the critical density ) in order to take into account that different clusters have different sizes ( see enacs vii for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "we have taken the elongation of the clusters into account by circularizing the individual galaxy distributions by increasing all projected distances orthogonal to the major axis , thus expanding the distribution parallel to the minor axis by a factor deduced from the ellipticities of individual clusters .",
    "this correction is important because the superposition of galaxy distributions with randomly distributed orientations will cause outer densities to be underestimated with respect to the inner ones , which is producing an artificial cusp ( cf enacs vii ) .",
    "we used a sample of 7 clusters from the cop ( adami et al .",
    "2000a , holden et al . 2000 ) and cnoc ( e.g. carlberg et al .",
    "1996 ) surveys selected with the same conditions as the low redshift sample :    1 .   low level of substructures in a 10 core radii square ( @xmath01200 kpc ) from visual analysis 2 .   more than 10 redshifts in the main group 3 .",
    "converging solutions of the fit of analytical galaxy number and luminosity density profiles ( this excludes 2 clusters : ms1008 and ms1224 ) .",
    "this sample is described in table 1 : the redshift range of this sample of distant clusters is [ 0.33;0.55 ] ( mean redshift = 0.42 ) .",
    "we have built a composite cluster of 459 galaxies with these 7 clusters , correcting for ellipticity and orientation of each real cluster , in a similar manner as we did for the nearby sample .",
    "we note that ms1358 is regarded in the cnoc papers as a complex cluster .",
    "however , we used in this paper only the central regions of this cluster in order to focus on the central cluster shape : we limited this cluster to a region of @xmath0160  radius . with this restriction",
    ", ms1358 can be included in our sample .",
    "we stress , however , that using larger areas will induce significant levels of substructures .",
    "the individual parameters ( with individual clusters ) of the low redshift sample profiles are described in adami et al .",
    "( 1998 : enacsiv ) .",
    "they have been computed with a maximum likelihood fit .",
    "we can easily generalized the same code to fit a luminosity profile for the composite clusters .",
    "we have weighted each galaxy with its luminosity ( assuming all the galaxies at the cluster redshift ) : @xmath8 . similarly to enacsvii , the probability that the assumed profile ` produces ' a galaxy in position ( x@xmath9,y@xmath9 ) is @xmath10 ( with k=1 ... n ) .",
    "the combined probability that the assumed profile will produce galaxies in the positions ( x@xmath9,y@xmath9 ) that they actually have is :    l=@xmath11    the best fit model is found from a maximization of l. we have chosen , instead , to compute -ln(l ) with :    ln l = @xmath12    the best model ( which produces the best fit ) is found from a minimization of -ln(l ) .",
    "we minimize this value by using the minuit package ( e.g. enacsvii for details ) .    to be able to quantify the degree of cuspiness at the center of the clusters , we fitted in enacsvii both a projected beta - model :    @xmath13    and a cusped profile :    @xmath14    for the luminosity profiles , @xmath15 is the surface brightness , which replaces the surface density @xmath16 of the formulae in enacsvii .",
    "these models , fitted to the individual clusters , have 7 free parameters : two parameters for the position of the center ( x@xmath2,y@xmath2 ) , two parameters to describe deviations from symmetry ( ellipticity e and position angle @xmath17 , included in r ) , two parameters that specify the profile ( r@xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and the background density @xmath20 ( assumed constant within the aperture of each cluster ) .",
    "to be able to compare the fit quality of the two models ( cusped profile and beta - model ) , we use the logarithm of the ratio of the maximum likelihood values for each fit as explained in enacsvii .",
    "this value has a @xmath21 distribution ( meyer 1975 ) which we then use to determine the statisticial significance level of the best fit of one profile type versus the other .",
    "moreover , we have checked the consistency between the center of the clusters determined by using the galaxies ( see enacsvii ) and the center determined by using the galaxies weightened with their luminosity .",
    "we find a shift of only ( 32 @xmath22 21 ) kpc .",
    "this shift is not large enough to erase a cusp ( e.g. enacsvii fig .",
    "8) and we have assumed the centers using only the galaxy number density .",
    "we used a similar approach as for the low redshift sample , but with an additional step to take into account the high background level .",
    "this is because it is nearly impossible to measure redshifts for all galaxies of all the clusters in our high redshift sample due to the large amount of observing time needed .",
    "therefore we used the red sequences in the color magnitude relations ( cmr hereafter ) to reject many of the field galaxies along the lines of sight ( e.g. yee et al . 1999 ) .",

    "we now examine whether that these values could have been affected by the following bias : the cmr rejects not only field galaxies but also the late type galaxies that are cluster members .",
    "since these galaxies are preferentially located in the outskirts of clusters ( e.g. adami et al .",

    "this is not a definitive test as we are using a single cluster , but the results are still very suggestive .    using the cmr seems , therefore , a good way to remove field galaxies in order to discriminate between cusped profiles and profiles with a core .",

    "this field contribution is between 50@xmath24 and 75@xmath24 for the clusters in our sample",
    "( estimated from the redshift catalogs of these cluster lines of sight ) .",
    "this could have the effect that the cluster density profiles will @xmath28 flatter for faint galaxies .",
    "this does not affect our results for nearby clusters ( we do not sample the clusters at magnitudes fainter than r=19 , where the cmr becomes to be less contrasted compared to the field contribution : adami et al . 2000b ) .",
    "this does not affect our results for distant clusters ( z@xmath00.4 ) for the brightest bin of table 3 ( magnitudes brighter than r=19 ) .",
    "this could have an influence for the 3 faintest bins of the distant composite cluster .",
    "however , the goal of this paper is to discriminate between density profiles with a cusp or with a core .",
    "in order to quantify the probability to have a cusped profile mis - interpreted as a profile with a core due to a high field contribution , we performed simulations .",
    "we generated a circular artificial cluster profile with a cusp in the center ( as described in section 3.1 with @xmath23=200kpc and @xmath19=0.67 ) and we added to this cluster a uniform field contribution with various galaxy densities .",
    "we computed finally the relative fit quality between a profile with a core and with a cusp . for field contributions as high as 80@xmath24 of the total number of galaxies along the line of sight , a model with a cusp is prefered at the 80@xmath24 significance level . for contributions equal to 85@xmath24 , a model with a cusp",
    "is prefered at the 70@xmath24 significance level . for higher field contributions , we are not able to discriminate between a profile with a core or with a cusp ( a model with a cusp is still prefered but with significance levels lower than 65@xmath24 , which is not significant ) . the results are plotted in fig .",
    "1 . this means that even with a high field contribution , we are still able to discriminate between profiles with a core or with a cusp because the field contribution along the lines of sight we used is not higher than 80@xmath24 .",

    "when re - doing the fit of a beta - model and a cusped profile for the bright galaxy bin with the cds removed , we still prefer a model with a cusp , with , however , at a lower significance level of 90 @xmath24 ( instead of 95 @xmath24 ) .",
    "this effect does not appear , however , to be dominant .",
    "we now discuss the difference between the galaxy number density and the luminosity profiles .",
    "a cusp in the galaxy number density profile could be erased by merging events , leading to a core .",
    "however , the luminosity profile of the bright galaxies has a cusp , but the same profile for the faint galaxies has a core .",
    "we discuss a scenario that would explain this result in the next subsection .",
    "suppose that the formation mechanism of the clusters does not initially produce a core , but only a cusp for both bright and faint galaxies , as in the simulations ( e.g. navarro et al . 1997 ) .",
    "this cusp could be `` erased '' in the galaxy number density profile by merging events and `` revealed '' in the luminosity profile for the bright galaxies .",
    "we must now explain why the luminosity profile for the faint galaxies has no cusp .",
    "this could be explained if we consider the other sources of galaxy destruction , beside the merging events : the tidal disruptions .",
    "tidal forces in the cluster center disrupt part of the faint galaxies , turning them into diffuse light , while the bright ones ( more massive and more robust ) are conserved .",
    "this explanation was , for example , proposed by merrit ( 1984 ) . by using simulations of the dynamical evolution of the cluster core",
    ", he predicted a tidal radius ( lowest value for the size of a not tidally disrupted galaxy ) of about 15 @xmath26 kpc .",
    "the bright galaxies , like cd galaxies , are significantly larger . the cusp could be erased in this way only for the faint galaxies which are generally smaller .",
    "more recent simulations by moore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show the same trend for the dwarf galaxies to be disrupted in the center of the clusters .",
    "such a destruction of the faint galaxies has been also proposed on observational bases for example by secker et al .",
    "( 1997 ) or gregg @xmath25 west ( 1998 ) .",
    "these last authors , using deep photometry of the coma cluster , propose the disruption of the faint galaxies as an explanation of the lack of dwarf galaxies in the core of this cluster ( e.g. also adami et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "a way to investigate this possibility is , for example , to search for cusped profile in the diffuse light .",
    "gregg @xmath25 west ( 1998 ) give an approximation of the total luminosity lost for the galaxies by disruption and turned into diffuse light in the center of the coma cluster .",
    "this value is about 20 @xmath24 of the luminosity of a cd galaxy .",
    "this contribution is around 50 @xmath24 of the luminosity sum of all galaxies fainter than @xmath37 in the central bin ( where the cusp is significant for the bright galaxies ) of our nearby composite cluster .",
    "after rescaling to the total luminosity to get units coherent with fig .",
    "2 , we see on this figure that such a contribution is large enough to enhance the three faint luminosity profiles , consistently with a cusped model .    a more quantitative study has been done for this same cluster by bernstein et al . (",
    "using very deep images of a cluster - central area of 7@xmath387 , they conclude that the faint galaxy luminosity profile is flat or decreasing in the central 40 kpc ( see also adami et al .",
    "2000b for a spectroscopic survey of this area ) , while the luminosity profile of the brighter galaxies is peaked .",
    "moreover , considering now the diffuse luminosity profile ( not associated with visible galaxies ) , they also found a peaked profile .",
    "if we argue that the cusp of the faint galaxy luminosity profile is erased by tidal disruption of part of these galaxies , we should recover at least partially this shape in the diffuse light profile .",
    "it is exactly what bernstein et al .",
    "saw in the coma cluster .",
    "we demonstrated that the cluster profiles have the same central shape from z@xmath00 to z@xmath00.5 .",
    "this would imply that the time scale of the destruction processes described above ( merging + disruption ) would be relatively short .",
    "this is because all the faint galaxies accreted between z@xmath00 and z@xmath00.5 do not contribute to the reconstruction of a cusp .",
    "the in - falling galaxies seem to be continuously destroyed , in a time close to the virialization time which is approximately 1.5 gyear ( e.g. sarazin , 1986 ) for faint galaxies .",
    "this estimate is , for example , in good agreement with the estimates of the time needed to disrupt a low surface brightness galaxy in the simulations of calcaneo - roldan et al .",
    "an alternative explanation in agreement with the observations is that the accretion rate could be already very low at z=0.5 ( e.g. ellingson et al .",
    "we have shown in this article that , on one hand , the galaxy luminosity density profile is cusped for the bright galaxies from z@xmath00 to z@xmath00.5 and exhibits a core for the faint galaxies . on another hand , the galaxy number density profile has a core ( not significant for the bright galaxies ) . this could be understood if we assume a cusped profile for all the galaxies in agreement for example with the simulations of navarro et al .",
    "the cusp could be erased for the galaxy number density profiles by merging effects and for the luminosity profile of the faint galaxies with the destruction of these galaxies by tidal forces .",
    "this seems to be confirmed by two observational studies of the coma cluster ( gregg @xmath25 west 1998 and bernstein et al ."
