    "in the last decades much attention has been devoted to the modeling of asset returns by the finance community , the major drive behind this effort being the improvement of pricing techniques for derivative contracts @xcite .",
    "the pricing problem is amenable to analytical solution for some stochastic volatility models @xcite such as hull - white @xcite , stein - stein @xcite and heston @xcite . despite differences in methods and emphasis ,",
    "the cross fecundation between economics and physics , which dates back to the early nineteenth century ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , has intensified recently @xcite . following the tradition of statistical physics",
    ", substantial effort has been made to find models capable of elucidating the basic mechanisms behind recurrent features of financial time series such as : returns aggregation ( probability distributions at any time scale ) @xcite , volatility clustering @xcite , leverage effect ( correlation between returns and volatilities ) @xcite , conditional correlations @xcite .",
    "recently , a semi - analytical solution for the fokker - planck equation describing the distribution of log - returns in the heston model has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the authors were able to show a good agreement between the return distributions of a number of developed market stock indices and the model , for time scales spanning a wide interval ranging from 1 to 100 days .    in this paper",
    "we show strong evidence that the heston model is capable of explaining the return distribution of the so paulo stock exchange index ( ibovespa ) in a period that span 35 years of political and economical unrest , with hyperinflation periods , currency crises and major regulatory changes .",
    "we also show that the heston model can explain the diffusive process of ibovespa from minutes to months with a single set o parameters . however , we observe that the heston model is inconsistent with the measured volatility autocorrelation function and we introduce an extension to the model along the lines discussed in @xcite which exhibits the correct behavior .",
    "the heston model describes the dynamics of stock prices @xmath0 as a geometric brownian motion with volatility given by a cox - ingersoll - ross ( or feller ) mean - reverting dynamics . in the it differential form",
    "the model reads : @xmath1dt\\;+\\;\\kappa\\sqrt{v_t}\\;dw_1(t),\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the volatility and @xmath3 are wiener processes with @xmath4\\ , \\delta(t-\\tilde{t})\\,dt.\\ ] ] the term @xmath5 avoids unphysical negative volatilities , @xmath6 is the macroeconomic long term volatility and @xmath7 represents a drift also at macroeconomic scales .",
    "interestingly , @xmath8 is a feller process ( [ eq_heston ] ) if @xmath9 are ornstein - uhlenbeck processes ( ou ) defined as @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath3 describe @xmath11 independent wiener processes .",
    "this observation restricts the possible parameter values to @xmath12 as the probability density of the volatility must vanish at zero to be consistent with the empirical data . to see how the volatility process in ( [ eq_heston ] ) emerges from ou processes we apply it s lemma to get : @xmath13 using the definition of @xmath14 and the properties of the wiener processes",
    "it follows that : @xmath15\\;dt \\;+\\;a\\sqrt{v_t}\\;dw.\\ ] ] the volatility process in ( [ eq_heston ] ) can be recovered by a few variable choices : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "note that , given the dimension @xmath11 , there are only two free parameters in ( [ eq_heston ] ) . the ou processes in ( [ eq_ou ] ) may be regarded as the primary microscopic sources of volatility and the condition of non - vanishing volatility implies that @xmath19 .",
    "we now outline the solution of the fokker - planck equation ( fp ) describing the distribution of log - returns proposed by dr@xmath20gulescu and yakovenko @xcite .    as we are mainly concerned with price fluctuations ,",
    "we simplify equation ( [ eq_heston ] ) by introducing log - returns in a window @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "using ito s lemma and changing variables by making @xmath23 we obtain a detrended version of the return dynamics that reads : @xmath24    the fp equation is , therefore , given by : @xmath25 }   + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(vp)+ \\rho\\kappa\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x\\partial v}(vp)+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}(vp ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\frac{\\kappa^2}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial v^2}(vp),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that has to be solved for the following boundary condition @xmath26 .",
    "a fourier transform in @xmath27 followed by a laplace transform in @xmath14 leads to a partial differential equation of the first degree that can be solved by the method of characteristics @xcite : @xmath28 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_v}\\right\\}q= -\\gamma\\,p_v\\,q,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and the boundary condition is @xmath30 .    the unconditional distribution of log - returns can be obtained by inverting the laplace and fourier transforms and integrating first over the volatility @xmath14 and then over the initial volatility @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the stationary solution for the volatility distribution ( see @xcite for details ) .    integrating ( [ eq : inversion2 ] )",

    "the formal integral of ( [ eq_volprocess ] ) is given by : @xmath36 a simple calculation gives the stationary autocorrelation function : @xmath37    the leverage function is @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is given by ( [ eq_detrended ] ) , @xmath40 is the heaviside step function and : @xmath41\\right\\rangle}{{\\langle v_t \\rangle}^2}. \\label{eq_g}\\ ] ] to simplify the numerical calculations we employ throughout this paper the zeroth order appoximation @xmath42 .",
    "the approximation error increases with the time lag @xmath43 but is not critical to our conclusions .    in the next section",
    "we simultaneously fit ( [ ac_function ] ) , ( [ leverage ] ) and the model ( [ px4 ] ) to fluctuations of the bovespa index at a wide range of time scales .",
    "three data sets were used .",
    "ib1 consists of daily data from ibovespa inception on january , 1968 to december , 2002 .",
    "ib1 was adjusted to take into account eleven divisions by 10 introduced in the period for disclosure purposes @xcite .",
    "ib2 consists of daily data from january , 2001 to august , 2003 .",
    "ib3 consists of high - frequency data from march 3 , 2001 to february 14 , 2003 and from june 6 , 2003 to august 26 , 2003 .",
    "large deviations are explained both by endogenous dynamics and by exogenous shocks .",
    "an adequate microscopic model for the price formation process has to explain spontaneous large movements and the system response to external shocks .",
    "however , here we only intend to model the typical behavior at mesoscopic scales ( price dynamics ) . in emerging markets , large movements with exogenous identifiable causes",
    "are frequent . in order to obtain a reliable fitting for the typical fluctuations we expunged from the data set large deviations connected to major structural changes , in figure 1",
    "we identify those externalities . for a brief historical account of recent brazilian economy see @xcite .      in equation",
    "[ eq_detrended ] we extract the macroeconomic drift @xmath7 to focus on price fluctuations .",
    "this drift at long time scales reflects the effect of inflation , economic growth , business cycles and the riskless interest rate . to extract @xmath7",
    "we have employed a low - pass savitzky - golay smoothing filter of degree two @xcite with averaging over a four years moving window ( _ i.e. _ one brazilian presidential term ) . in figure 1 we show @xmath44 for the whole data set ( top ) and the fluctuations around the trend in the last ten years ( bottom ) .",
    "this choice of smoothing technique is heuristic and may introduce artifacts at time scales of lengths comparable to the moving windows ( 4 years in our case ) .",
    "we , therefore , restrict our analysis to a maximum period of 100 days and leave a thorough analysis of this aspect to another occasion .",
    "after filtering the trend we have to fit four parameters : the long term mean volatility @xmath6 , the relaxation time for mean reversion @xmath45 , the volatility fluctuation scale @xmath46 and the correlation between price and volatility @xmath47 .",
    "it became apparent in @xcite that a simple least squares fit that takes into account only ( [ px4 ] ) yields parameters that are not uniquely defined .",
    "the task of finding parameters fitting all the main stilyzed facts simultaneously is not trivial . in this paper",
    "we do not intend to focus on parameter estimation , hence we adopt a heuristic procedure and do not provide rigorous error bars .",
    "these questions will be addressed somewhere else .",
    "we first estimate the long term mean volatility @xmath6 directly from the daily log - returns as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for daily detrended log - returns",
    ".    a proper fit must be also consistent with the non - vanishing volatilities constraint , @xmath50 .",
    "we , therefore , minimize a constraint free cost function and adjust @xmath46 to attain consistency with the constraint .",
    "[ pdf ]    the following cost function is employed : @xmath51 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{l}\\sum_{l=1}^{l } \\left[1-\\frac{c^{e}(\\tau_l)}{c(\\tau_l \\mid \\gamma,\\hat{\\theta},\\kappa ) } \\right]^2 .",
    "\\label{cost}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the empirical leverage function is @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and the empirical autocorrelation function is : @xmath54 we then employ the parameters obtained above to fit the probability density of returns and adjust the parameter @xmath47 to the empirical data minimizing the mean squared error . we will discuss a more systematic approach to parameter estimation elsewhere as our main aim here is restricted to showing the description capability of the heston model .",
    "the parameters found are in the following table :    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ data_levacf ] shows ib1 data and curve fits .",
    "it is clear that , under the vanishing volatility constraint , a single relaxation time is not simultaneously consistent with leverage and autocorrelation functions .",
    "the best fit for the autocorrelation is shown as a dashed line .",
    "we deal with this inconsistency in the final sections of this paper by extending the heston model to include two relaxation times .      at first glance ,",
    "it is not clear whether intraday and daily returns can be described by the same stochastic dynamics .",
    "even less clear is whether aggregation from intraday to daily returns can be described by the same parameters . to verify this latter possibility we have to transform units by determining the effective duration in minutes of a business day @xmath55 .",
    "the dimensional parameters are , therefore , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in order to avoid the effects of non - stationarity we also use data from the same period ( ib2 and ib3 ) . from ib2 and ib3",
    "we found the effective duration of a day to be about @xmath59 minutes .",
    "the so paulo stock market opens daily at 11 a.m. and closes at 7:30 p.m. local time , resulting in exactly @xmath60 minutes .",
    "the effective duration infered from data exceeds , therefore , in @xmath61 minutes the real duration of a normal business day , an amount that is explained by the effect of overnight and lunchtime jumps . in figure 4",
    "we show a histogram of jumps compared to intraday returns at @xmath62 and @xmath63 minutes . considering both overnight and lunchtime jumps , between @xmath64 to @xmath61 minutes",
    "must be added to a normal business day , just the right amount to make @xmath55 compatible to the hypotheses of a single set of parameters describing time scales from minutes to months . in figure [ ib2 ]",
    "we show observations and data for ib2 and ib3 with parameters given by the table above .",
    "these findings are suported by similar results presented in @xcite for high - frequency returns of individual stocks traded in nasdaq and nyse .",
    "the datasets ib1 and ib3 yield @xmath65 minutes , the @xmath66 minutes excess is explained by the well known non - stationarity of the parameters revealed in the table above , that shows that the mean variance in the @xmath67 years period ( ib1 , @xmath68 @xmath69 ) is higher than the mean variance observed in the last two years ( ib2 , @xmath70 @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is interesting to stress that in an emerging market like the brazilian structural changes related to political events are frequent . in figure [ histvol ]",
    "we try to put the the macroeconomic non - stationarity of the mean variance @xmath71 in a historical perspective , identifying some important political events .",
    "the robust statistical behavior here reported are particularly surprising when one considers the extremely abrupt structural changes that take place in an emerging market .",
    "it is clear in figure [ data_levacf ] that the heston model is not capable of describing the autocorrelation function . to rectify this inconsistency",
    "we propose the inclusion of a second , slower , time scale into the dynamical model along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we assume a stochastic dynamical model where the stochastic volatility reverts to a second stochastic volatility with much longer relaxation time @xmath72 .",
    "the new model reads : @xmath73dt\\;+\\;\\kappa_1\\sqrt{v(t)}\\;dw_1(t),\\nonumber\\\\   d\\theta & = & -\\gamma_2\\left[\\theta(t)-\\theta_0\\right]dt\\;+\\;\\kappa_2\\sqrt{\\theta(t)}\\;dw_2(t),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 e @xmath3 are wiener processes defined as : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a correlation matrix with @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    in this model",
    "the autocorrelation function acquires the following form : @xmath80 with @xmath81 , where @xmath82 stands for the average of @xmath6 given @xmath83 . in figure [ data_levacf ]",
    "we show a fit of this autocorrelation function to the data , the new relaxation time is @xmath84 days and @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "it is possible to solve the fokker - planck equation for this extended model in the limit where @xmath87 .",
    "we will discuss this model in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we showed that the heston model can reproduce the diffusion process of a 35 years long time series of ibovespa returns at a wide range of time scales from days to months .",
    "we also show that the heston model can explain the aggregation of returns from minutes to months with a single set o parameters that change in the macroeconomic scales . however , the heston model , with a single relaxation time , is not capable of explaining the behavior of the autocorrelation function .",
    "we , therefore , proposed an extended version of the model with the addition of a slow stochastic dynamics that yields an autocorrelation function consistent with the observations .",
    "it is surprising that a single non - trivial stochastic model may be capable of explaining the long - term statistical behavior of both developed and emerging markets , despite the known instability and high susceptibility to externalities of the latter .",
    "we believe that this robust non - trivial statistical behavior is evidence for more basic mechanisms acting in the market microstructure .",
    "perhaps the search for underlying common mechanisms ( or laws ) that can explain empirical data is the main contribution of physics to economics",
    ". this contribution might be particularly useful to the field of econometrics in which a common view is that a theory built from data ` should be evaluated in terms of the quality of the decisions that are made based on the theory ' @xcite .",
    "clearly , these two approaches should not be considered as mutually exclusive .",
    "we thank victor yakovenko and his collaborators for discussions and for providing useful matlab codes .",
    "we also wish to thank the so paulo stock exchange ( bovespa ) for gently providing high - frequency data .",
