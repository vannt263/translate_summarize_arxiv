    "at a continuous transition , the expression @xmath13 for the leading critical behavior of a thermodynamic observable @xmath14 has the well known form @xmath15 where @xmath0 and @xmath16 are the transition temperature and the critical exponent respectively . for the concrete analysis of numerical data , a normalization factor with non - critical behavior at @xmath0",
    "must be introduced .",
    "the simplest and most traditional convention , which will be referred to below as @xmath17 scaling , is to normalize each @xmath18 by a temperature independent constant . for obvious reasons this constant",
    "is chosen to be @xmath19 for each observable ; one then writes the normalized leading term as the familiar text - book expression : @xmath20^{-\\rho_f } = { \\cal   c}_{f}t^{-\\rho_f } , \\label{t_scaling}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the critical amplitude ( see  [ ] for a detailed review ) .",
    "an alternative and _ a priori _ equally valid choice is to write @xmath23^{-\\rho_f } = { \\cal c}_{f}[(t-\\tc)/t]^{-\\rho_f}\\nonumber \\\\ & = & { \\cal c}_{f}\\left[1-\\frac{\\beta}{\\bec}\\right]^{-\\rho_f } = { \\cal c}_{f}\\tau^{-\\rho_f } , \\label{beta_scaling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the inverse temperature @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "note that the temperature dependence of the normalization is now different for each observable .",
    "this `` @xmath24 scaling '' form has become the standard normalization for theoretical work on the critical properties of ferromagnets and analogous systems , see for instance  @xcite , although more complex normalizations have been used in special cases . at higher order , confluent and analytic correction terms ( such as temperature independent constants )",
    "are introduced . thus including the confluent correction terms , the critical behavior , @xmath27 ,",
    "is written in terms of the @xmath24 scaling as @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the [ universal ] confluent correction exponent , and @xmath31 is the confluent correction amplitude . in the @xmath17 scaling form ,",
    "@xmath5 in the above equation is replaced by @xmath32 .",
    "this critical scaling form is firmly established by field theory in the limit of temperatures very close to @xmath33  @xcite",
    ". ratios of the @xmath31 for different observables are universal  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath34 is common in both scaling forms so long as @xmath35 .",
    "however , no general argument seems to have been given which would show that either the @xmath17 or the @xmath24 scaling is optimal for all ( or any ) observables when a much wider temperature range is considered .",
    "recently we have proposed an extended scaling scheme for normalizing observables such that the leading critical expressions remain good approximations right up to the trivial fixed point at infinite temperature  @xcite .",
    "our extended scaling scheme is based on a consideration of high - temperature series expansions ( htse ) , and so is naturally formulated in terms of the @xmath24 scaling .",
    "the most important ingredient of the scheme is the introduction of non - critical prefactors @xmath36 in the normalizations , where each exponent @xmath37 is uniquely chosen such that the normalized @xmath38 tends to the correct asymptotic form in the limit @xmath39 .    in the present work our aim is to further develop our extended scaling scheme to include explicitly the confluent and analytical correction terms .",
    "we then validate our scheme by analyzing data for three canonical ferromagnets : the @xmath40 ising , xy and heisenberg models on simple cubic lattices in dimension three .",
    "these models have been intensively studied over many years and their main critical parameters : @xmath0 , the critical exponents @xmath16 , @xmath34 , and certain critical amplitudes are known to high precision .",
    "careful accounts of studies using different complementary approaches are given for instance in refs .",
    "accurate simulation and htse results have been published in the form of tabulated data .",
    "the present analyses show that the appropriately normalized leading terms are good approximations over the entire temperature range , with small but identifiable corrections due to confluent and non - critical terms .",
    "we obtain estimates of non - universal critical parameters like critical amplitudes @xmath41 and confluent correction amplitudes @xmath42 from the high precision numerical data .",
    "our extended scaling analyses are in each case entirely consistent with field theoretical and htse estimates of the critical parameters .",
    "an important result of the present analysis is to demonstrate that the prefactors @xmath36 which have been introduced play a crucial role in extracting accurate values of the critical exponents from simulation data even in a temperature range close to @xmath0 , such as @xmath43 . in the standard scalings without the prefactors",
    "the estimates of the leading critical term and of the confluent term from analyses of numerical data turn out to be modified to order @xmath44 ( note @xmath45 )",
    ".    the same approach based on the htse should be directly applicable to a wide class of systems having the same intrinsic htse structure as the simple ferromagnets .",

    "an important quantity for analyzing our extended scaling scheme is @xmath61 defined by @xmath62 it is the ratio of the measured values of observable @xmath14 to its leading critical term including the @xmath36 prefactor but without the critical amplitude @xmath41 .",
