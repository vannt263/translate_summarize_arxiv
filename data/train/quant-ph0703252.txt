    "quantum key distribution has attracted extensive attentions for its unconditional security compared with conversional cryptography @xcite .",
    "however , there still exist several technical limitations in practice , such as imperfect single - photon sources , large loss channels and inefficient detectors , which will impair the security . fortunately",
    ", many methods have been devised to deal with these imperfect conditions @xcite , among which , decoy - state method is thought to be a very useful candidate for substantially improving the performance of qkd .",
    "decoy - state method was firstly proposed by hwang @xcite , and advanced by wang and lo _ et al . _",
    "_ assuming a weak coherent source ( wcs ) .",
    "subsequently , it was extended to parametric down- conversion sources ( pdcs ) @xcite .",
    "the main idea of decoy - state method is to randomly change the intensity of each pulse among different values , which allows one to estimate the behavior of vacuum , single - photon and multi - photon states individually . as a result",

    "recently , more and more interesting ideas have been put forward to improve the performance of qkd @xcite , such as the one by adachi _",
    "_ @xcite . _ _ in their proposal , both triggered and nontriggered components of pdcs are used to do some estimations for final secure key , and it needs only one intensity to transmit .",
    "however , because the intensity can not be changed during the whole experiment , and dark counts can not be measured directly , then the worst case of their contribution must be considered , which will inevitably limit final key rate and transmission distance .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new practical decoy - state scheme with pdcs , in which not only three decoy states with different intensities ( @xmath0 ) , but also all their triggered and nontriggered components are used to estimate the lower bound of fraction of single photon counts ( @xmath1 ) and upper bound of quantum bit - error rate ( qber ) of single - photon ( @xmath2 ) . as a result",
    ", a more accurate value of key generation rate , compared with existing methods , can be obtained .",
    "in our new scheme , we can essentially use almost the same experimental setup as that in our previous proposal @xcite , except that bob s detector need to work no matter what alice s detector is triggered or not .    as is well known , the state of two - mode field from pdcs  is @xcite:@xmath3 where @xmath4 represents an @xmath5-photon state , and @xmath6 is the intensity ( average photon number ) of one mode .",

    "for example , at the distance of 50 km , setting @xmath77 in our new scheme , and @xmath78 in the old one , we can get a ratio of key rate between the two scheme as 3.8 .",
    "the reason that we can get a more accurate estimation of key rate ( @xmath79 ) in the new proposal is as follows : we do nt omit those high order items ( in formula ( 6 ) ) in the deduction of @xmath1 , but use them to deduce a relationship between the intensity of decoy state ( @xmath23 ) and signal state ( @xmath25 ) , which inevitably results in a more bound estimation of @xmath80(in addition , there is an inflexion in curve c ( d ) at the distance about 134 km , because the nontriggered events cease to contribute to the key rate . )    fig .",

    "3 ( b ) shows the ratio of the key generation rate between our new scheme and adachi _ et al _ s against transmission distance , ( both triggered events and nontriggered events are used . )",
    "it shows that our result is always larger than theirs when using almost the same level of data size @xcite .    from the figures above",
    ", we can see that , our new results are better than those of both our previous proposal and adachi _ et al _ s .",
    "as is known @xcite , to give a more accurate estimation of the key rate , the value of @xmath23 should be chosen to be the smaller the better . in our previous proposal",
    ", the key rate could also be very close to the ideal value given a very weak decoy state @xmath23 .",
    "however , in a practical experiment , considering statistical errors , @xmath23 can not be too weak .",
    "so in our new scheme , we deduce a relation between @xmath23 and @xmath25 , and at each point , both @xmath23 and @xmath25 can be chosen with optimal values , which results in a more accurate estimation . comparing with adachi _",
    "et al _ s proposal , the advantages of our proposal are as follows : firstly , dark counts can be measured directly ; secondly , a weaker decoy state @xmath23 is used to get a more accurate estimation of @xmath81and @xmath2 , and a stronger signal of @xmath25 is used to get a higher secure key rate .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a new decoy - state scheme in qkd with pdcs , in which we use both three - intensity decoy - states and their triggered and nontriggered components to get a tight bound of the fraction of single - photon counts and single - photon qber , this allows us to accurately deduce the value of key generation rate . finally , the key generation rate vs transmission distance is numerically simulated .",
    "the simulations show that our new results are better than those of the existing proposal .",
    "furthermore , our proposal only assumes existing experimental technology , which makes the scheme a practical candidate in the implementation of qkd .",
