    "damped lyman-@xmath2 systems , with  column densities @xmath10  @xmath11 , are the high-@xmath8 gas - rich counterparts of today s normal galaxies , and crucial to understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "however , despite much observational effort , our knowledge of the typical size , structure and internal conditions of high @xmath8 dlas is yet limited ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a controversial issue is the  temperature distribution in the absorbers , whether most of the  is in a warm , low - density phase ( the warm neutral medium , wnm , with kinetic temperature @xmath12  k ; @xcite ) , or whether a significant fraction is in a high density , cold phase ( the cnm , with @xmath13  k ) . for dlas towards radio - loud quasars ,",
    "this can be determined by combining the optical depth in the redshifted  21 cm line with the  column density measured from the lyman-@xmath2 profile to obtain the column - density - weighted harmonic mean spin temperature @xmath14 along the sightline ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "dlas have been shown to have higher @xmath14 values ( @xmath15  k ; e.g. @xcite ) than those typically found in the milky way or local spirals ( @xmath16  k ; @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this , in the context of stable two - phase models , is that high-@xmath8 dlas contain larger wnm fractions than local disks @xcite .",
    "conversely , @xcite argue that the detection of cii * absorption in a number of high-@xmath8 dlas indicates sizeable cnm fractions ( @xmath17% ) in half the dla population",
    ".    a plausible cause for the putative higher wnm fractions in high-@xmath8 dlas is their typically - low metallicity [ z / h ] , implying fewer routes for gas cooling .",
    "if high @xmath14 values in dlas arise due to low absorber metallicities , one would expect an anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] , with low-@xmath14 dlas having high metallicities , and vice - versa @xcite .",
    "we report here the detection of the predicted anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] , supporting the conclusion that  in high-@xmath8 dlas is predominantly in the warm neutral medium .",

    "we have carried out  21 cm absorption studies of dlas towards compact , radio - loud quasars to measure their spin temperatures ( e.g. @xcite ) , and have also measured the dla covering factors through low - frequency very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) studies @xcite .",
    "the vlbi images yield the fraction of compact radio emission , and thus a lower limit to the dla covering factor .",
    "however , no additional radio emission is detected up to scales of @xmath18 , indicating that the remaining emission arises from much larger scales ( @xmath19  kpc ) , and is unlikely to be covered by the foreground dla .",
    "the radio core fraction thus provides a good estimate of the dla covering factor .",
    "we have also obtained metallicity estimates for most of the dlas with  21 cm studies from our own observations or the literature .",
    "there are 26  dlas , at @xmath20 , with estimates of both @xmath14 and [ z / h ] , of which 20 have covering factor estimates from low - frequency vlbi studies , and 21  have estimates of dust depletion , [ z / fe ] .",
    "the 26  absorbers of the sample are listed in table  [ tab : met ] , whose columns contain ( 1 )  the quasar name , ( 2 )  the dla redshift , ( 3 )  the  column density measured from the lyman-@xmath2 profile , ( 4 )  the dla covering factor @xmath21 , ( 5 )  the spin temperature @xmath14 , or , for  21 cm non - detections , the @xmath22 lower limit to @xmath14 ( taking into account the dla covering factor , when known ) , ( 6 )  the metallicity [ z / h ] , ( 7 )  the dust depletion factor [ z / fe ] , ( 8)  the transitions used for the [ z / h ] and [ z / fe ] estimates , and ( 9 )  references for [ z / h ] and [ zn / fe ] values . in all but two cases , @xmath23 , in order of preference .",

    "we have also excluded `` associated '' dlas , lying within @xmath33  km  s@xmath34  of the quasar , as conditions in these absorbers could be affected by their proximity to an active galactic nucleus .",

    "the results of the present _ letter _ are based on new  21 cm data on @xmath35  absorbers , and vlbi estimates of the dla covering factor for most systems , and yield the first clear evidence for a relation between the metallicity and the  temperature distribution in the absorbers .",

    "we used the non - parametric generalized kendall rank correlation statistic @xcite , as implemented in the asurv package ( the bhk statistic ) , to test for a correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] , treating the latter as the independent variable .",
    "this allows limits in both variables to be treated consistently .",
    "errors on individual measurements were handled through a monte - carlo approach , using the measured values and @xmath39 errors for each absorber to generate @xmath40 sets of 26 pairs of [ z / h ] and @xmath14 values .",

    "a linear regression analysis was used to obtain the best - fit relation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] , using the ten systems with measurements of both @xmath14 and [ z / h ] ( i.e. excluding all limits ) , all of which also have covering factor estimates ; these are shown in fig .",

    "we also tested for a correlation between the dust depletion factor [ z / fe ] and @xmath14 , using the 21  systems with estimates of both quantities .",
    "the anti - correlation between [ z / fe ] and @xmath14 has @xmath48 significance , reducing to @xmath49 significance on excluding the possibly - unreliable x - ray metallicity estimate in the dla towards 0235 + 164 .",
    "we thus do not find significant evidence for a relation between [ z / fe ] and @xmath14 , although this sub - sample contains few dlas with low spin temperatures .",
    "@xcite note that an observed anti - correlation between @xmath14 and metallicity might arise due to unknown low covering factors .",
    "we hence estimated the bhk statistic for the sub - sample of 20  dlas with covering factor estimates @xcite .",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] is then detected at @xmath50 significance , with a probability of @xmath51 of chance occurrence .",
    "low covering factors are thus unlikely to be the cause of the anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] .",
    "it is possible that the observed anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] is not a `` primary '' relation , but stems from an underlying relation between other physical quantities ( e.g. velocity spread and metallicity ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that an observed correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] might arise due to a relation between the velocity spread of  21 cm absorption @xmath52 and the rest equivalent width of the  line , @xmath53 , each tracing the dynamics of the absorber .",
    "they note that @xmath54 \\approx   { \\rm n_{hi } } / \\left [ \\tau_{\\rm 21,max } \\delta v_{\\rm 21 } \\right]$ ] , suggesting that @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath53 is known to correlate with metallicity @xcite , so , if @xmath52 also correlates with @xmath53 , the three relations could yield an observed anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] .",
    "however , the  column density in dlas does not correlate with either [ z / h ] or @xmath53 ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the dlas of table  [ tab : met ] have @xmath45 values extending over @xmath56  dex . if the @xmath14[z / h ] relation arises due to an underlying relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , this spread in @xmath45 values would imply that the @xmath14[z / h ] relation would be _ weaker _ than the relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( and vice - versa , if the @xmath14[z / h ] relation is the `` primary '' relation ) .",
    "in other words , the `` primary '' relation would have the highest statistical significance in samples of similar size , as uncorrelated ( and variable ) parameters like @xmath45 would dilute the significance of any derived relations .",
    "@xcite used the bhk test to test for correlations between @xmath53 and both the  21 cm velocity spread @xmath52 and the integrated  21 cm optical depth @xmath57 , in a sample of mgii absorbers and dlas .",
    "they found the putative correlation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 to have @xmath58 significance ( with 23  absorbers ) , and that between @xmath57 and @xmath53 to have @xmath48 significance ( with 24  absorbers ) .",
    "both these trends are significantly weaker than the relation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] found here ( @xmath59 significance ) , in samples of similar size .",
    "it is thus unlikely that the anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] arises from an underlying relation between @xmath53 and either @xmath52 or @xmath57 .",
    "the present data indicate that the anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] is the `` primary '' relation , given its higher statistical significance .",
    "high spin temperature estimates in high-@xmath8 dlas have been the focus of much debate , with suggestions that these might arise due to different sightlines at optical and radio wavelengths @xcite or low covering factors @xcite .",
    "it is possible that individual @xmath14 measurements might be in error due to these effects .",
    "however , recent low - frequency vlbi studies have shown that high @xmath14 values are not the result of low dla covering factors @xcite .",
    "further , the anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] is detected in the sub - sample of dlas with covering factor measurements , indicating that this relation too is not caused by low covering factors .",
    "finally , differing optical and radio sightlines ( e.g. if the radio emission is extended on scales larger than the size of the optical quasar ) would result in @xmath14 estimates that are uncorrelated with the `` true '' @xmath14 values along the optical sightline .",
    "this would _ weaken _ any underlying correlation between @xmath14 and a quantity like [ z / h ] , measured along the pencil beam towards the optical quasar .",
    "the detection of the predicted anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] thus indicates that line - of - sight issues are also not the source of the observed high @xmath14 values .",
    "we conclude that the high @xmath14 estimates in high-@xmath8 dlas are most likely to arise due to larger wnm fractions in dlas than typical in local spiral galaxies .    in the local universe , the metallicity and mass of galaxies",
    "are known to be correlated ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a similar correlation , between metallicity and stellar mass , has been found in emission - selected , high-@xmath8 galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for a mass - metallicity relation in dlas is unclear .",
    "@xcite argue that the observed correlation between the kinematic width of unsaturated low - ionization metal profiles @xmath60 and metallicity in high-@xmath8 dlas arises from an underlying mass - metallicity relation .",
    "conversely , @xcite note that @xmath60 is a weak indicator of galaxy mass at @xmath61 , as the kinematic width measured along a pencil beam depends on the galaxy inclination and the impact parameter . however , the above correlation between @xmath60 and metallicity has been reproduced in simulations @xcite , which suggest that it does stem from a mass - metallicity relation .",
    "@xcite find that sightlines through dlas with low virial masses , @xmath62 , typically yield low metallicities , [ z / h]@xmath63 , while the typical metallicities are [ z / h]@xmath64 in intermediate - mass galaxies ( @xmath65 ) , and [ z / h]@xmath66 in high - mass systems ( @xmath67 ; for comparison , @xmath68 for the milky way ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite find a tight correlation between the rest equivalent width in the saturated siii@xmath691526 line @xmath70 and metallicity , and argue that @xmath70 tracks dynamical motions in the halos of dlas , with the correlation between @xmath71 and [ z / h ] arising due to a mass - metallicity relation of the same slope as that seen in low-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "if a mass - metallicity relation is present in dlas , low - mass dlas would have low metallicities .",
    "low - mass galaxies also have low thermal pressures , while a high pressure is needed for the formation of a stable multi - phase medium at a low metallicity .",
    "fig .  6 of @xcite shows that , at low pressures and metallicities ,  exists mostly in the warm phase .",
    "sightlines through such galaxies would thus typically yield a high spin temperature .",
    "conversely , the mass - metallicity relation implies that high - mass dlas would have high metallicities , along with high thermal pressures .",
    "such galaxies would have significant cnm fractions , with most sightlines yielding low spin temperatures .",
    "these effects would yield the anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] detected here , due to the paucity of cooling routes in low - metallicity galaxies @xcite .",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] is thus consistent with the presence of a mass - metallicity relation in dlas @xcite ; low - metallicity dlas are likely to have high @xmath14 values due to their low cnm fractions .",
    "while the relation between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] is consistent with the presence of a mass - metallicity relation in dlas , it is also possible that the @xmath14[z / h ] relation is a local one , arising due to line - of - sight issues . for disk galaxies ,",
    "the cross - section for dla incidence is largest for sightlines through the outskirts of the galaxy .",
    "if high-@xmath8 dlas have steep metallicity gradients , such sightlines would typically encounter low metallicities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of _ local _ cooling routes could then result in low cnm fractions , and high @xmath14 values along these sightlines .",
    "conversely , sightlines through the central regions of large disk galaxies would typically have high metallicities and high cnm fractions .",
    "such line - of - sight effects could thus also yield the anti - correlation of fig .",
    "[ fig : tszn ] .",
    "while such steep metallicity gradients have not been seen in local galaxies and low-@xmath8 dlas ( typical gradients are @xmath72  dex  kpc@xmath34 ; @xcite ) , they are not ruled out in high-@xmath8 dlas .",
    "we note , in passing , that the @xmath24 dla towards 0827 + 243 has one of the largest dla impact parameters ( @xmath73  kpc ; @xcite ) , and yet has both a low @xmath14 ( @xmath74  k ) and a high metallicity , [ z / h]@xmath75 .",
    "[ fig : tszn][a ] shows that low @xmath14 values are only found in dlas with [ z / h]@xmath37 .",
    "only 13  of the 153  dlas at @xmath76 in the sample of @xcite have such high metallicities ; the majority of high-@xmath8 dlas have [ z / h]@xmath77 . the anti - correlation between @xmath14 and",
    "[ z / h ] then implies that most high  @xmath8 dlas have high @xmath14 values .",
    "conversely , six of seventeen dlas at @xmath78 have [ z / h]@xmath79 ( e.g. @xcite ) . while the number of metallicity measurements at @xmath80 is yet small ,",
    "the present data indicate a higher fraction of high - metallicity dlas at low redshifts .",
    "if so , the @xmath14[z / h ] anti - correlation implies that the fraction of dlas with high cnm fraction should also be larger at @xmath78 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed increase in the detection rate of  21 cm absorption in dlas at @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite found that the strong cii * lines detected in half their dlas could not be explained by absorption in pure wnm , and implied the presence of cold .",
    "they argue that  in dlas without cii * absorption is likely to be predominantly warm , but that a two - phase model with a cnm fraction of @xmath17% is consistent with the observed bolometric luminosity in systems with cii * detections .",
    "however , lower cnm fractions are not ruled out .",
    "for example , the @xmath81 dla towards pks  0201 + 113 shows strong cii * absorption @xcite , but has a low metallicity , [ s / h]@xmath82 @xcite , and a low cnm fraction , @xmath83% @xcite .",
    "this suggests that , while dlas showing cii * absorption contain _ some _ cnm , the  content of low - metallicity absorbers is still likely to be dominated by the wnm ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "the fact that a relation is seen between @xmath14 and [ z / h ] implies that the high @xmath14 values in dlas are unlikely to be an artifact arising from differences between radio and optical sightlines through the absorbers , and are instead likely to reflect the underlying gas temperature distribution .",
