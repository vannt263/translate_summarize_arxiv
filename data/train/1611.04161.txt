    "thermal stability for pristine , free - standing graphene constitutes a crucial piece of knowledge for them to be used as functional materials in practical applications .",
    "its melting temperature in particular is a natural benchmark of the thermal stability for carbon - based nanomaterials .",
    "however , melting temperature of an infinite , free - standing graphene is hard to measure experimentally .",
    "most measurements of the melting temperature of graphene were carried out on samples sitting on supporting substrate . measured values of melting temperature of",
    "infinitely extended free - standing graphene are not directly available . as a reference ,",
    "the melting temperature of bulk graphite measured experimentally has a large discrepancy and lies between 4000 or 5000 k @xcite .    as a complementary tool to experimental measurement , melting phenomena of nanostructures nowadays can be routinely simulated via atomistic simulation techniques such as molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , melting temperature of graphene calculated via atomistic simulations as reported in the literature has not converged to a unique value .",
    "the criteria for defining `` melting temperature '' of graphene used by researchers in atomistic simulation is not universal , and varies from one paper to another .",
    "in addition , in many simulations reported in the literature , such as in @xcite , the melting of graphene does not occur abruptly at a single temperature as in bulk materials .",
    "there appear to be a pre - melting stage at a lower temperature where carbon atoms begin to shake off from the main body while it still maintain an overall intact form .",
    "only when the temperature hits a higher value does graphene begin to display a `` spontaneous '' melting , after the occurrence of pre - melting at a lower temperature @xcite .",
    "while infinitely extended free - standing graphene receives no contribution from finite size effect on its melting temperature , its finite counterparts do .",
    "in other words , the melting temperature of a finite graphene is size - dependent .",
    "most measurements of graphene melting phenomena were conducted on supported substrates , and it is experimentally difficult to measure an unambiguous melting temperature for free - standing graphene . quantifying finite size effect",
    "experimentally would be even more so .",
    "specific atomistic simulation approaches such as monte carlo and molecular dynamics , which inherently incorporate temperature effect in their algorithms , are most suitable for the task to gain theoretical insight into the thermal stability and melting behavior of graphene .",
    "lopez _ et al .",
    "_ in an earlier paper ( in 2005 ) @xcite performed md simulation to address the relative thermal stability between finite length carbon nanotube ( cnt ) and the corresponding nanostrips obtained from opening up these cnt .",
    "however , @xcite only estimated the bond - breaking temperature for these nanostripts instead of their melting temperature .",
    "the bond - breaking temperature , which was abstracted from the caloric curves , represents the lower bound of the graphene melting temperature .",
    "they found that the bond - breaking temperature has a non - monotonous size - dependence , ranging from @xmath02350 k to @xmath02650 k for nanostrips derived by opening up ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) cnt with 3 to 9 times the unit cell length .    in their 2007 md simulation , in which edip forcefield was employed , kowaki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a different approach to determine melting temperature of infinite size graphene .",
    "they first determined the melting temperature for different radius of infinite single - walled carbon nanotube ( swcnt ) .",
    "as strain energy reduces when radius of infinite swcnt increases , melting temperature of infinite swcnt will approach that of infinite size graphene when the radius of infinite swcnt approaches infinity . the abrupt change in the oscillation pattern of radial distribution function due to temperature increment , the tale - telling temperature dependence of mean - square displacement and the dynamic atomic configuration as visually inspected were among the criterion used to determine the melting temperature of infinite swcnt .",
    "they concluded that the melting temperature of an infinitely extended free - standing graphene is 5750 k. in their 2011 paper , zakharchenko  @xcite performed monte carlo simulation for graphene melting using lcbopii forcefield . defining their criteria based on a two - dimensional lindemann type order parameter , they arrived at a melting temperature of about 4900 k.    sandeep k. singh _",

    "the carbon nanostructures studied are minimum energy configurations ( in the form of nanoflakes ) and were comprised of 98 , 142 , 194 , 322 and 1000 atoms .",
    "they used distance - fluctuation lindemann criteria and caloric curve to determine the melting temperature .",
    "the melting temperature of graphene nanoflakes increases with the number of carbon atoms , where the melting temperature increases monotonically from 3800 - 4400 k when the size of nanoflakes increases from 98 to 1000 atoms .",
    "the melting temperature of infinite graphene was calculated to be 5500 k.    the most recent work on the melting of graphene comes from los _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which is a follow - up of their previous paper @xcite , adopted an intrinsic definition of graphene melting based on nucleation theory to arrive at a lower melting temperature of 4510 k.    the varied values of melting temperature of infinite , free - standing graphene as reported in published simulation works can be traced to a few reasons : a precise definition of melting criteria is not consensually adopted ; the use of different forcefield generally results in a different melting behavior ( e.g. , the sublimation mechanisms as well as the critical temperatures at which they occur , as predicted by the sed - rebo potential was much different than rebo @xcite ) ; difference in the details of the simulation procedure , e.g. , the manner by which the temperature of the system is varied and how the melting temperature is measured .    in this paper",
    "we wish to contribute to the elucidation of the melting phenomena of infinite and finite size graphene by conducting systematically designed md calculations . to this end",
    ", a robust and reliable choice of forcefield for performing md simulation has to be made .",
    "the forcefield of our choice is the adaptive intermolecular reactive empirical bond ( airebo ) forcefield @xcite , an improvement of the well - known brenner potential @xcite .",
    "both forcefields are well - tested for md simulation of graphene and cnt .",

    "the systems of interest are heated up until melting phenomena occurs . to this end ,",
    "nose - hover thermostat as implemented in the lammps package is used to control the temperature in all of our simulations .",
    "there are non - unique ways to heat up a system in a md simulation . as a matter of principle",
    ", the results obtained ( in our case , the melting temperature ) from different heating protocols should be consistent with each other . in this paper",
    ", we adopt two different heating procedures , dubbed direct- and prolonged - heating protocols , to counter - check for consistency in the melting temperatures obtained from a common simulated system . these heating protocols are described in subsections [ sub : dhp ] and [ sub : php ] respectively .",
    "the melting temperature of infinite graphene sheet is obtained from three independent simulation experiments , which are described in subsections [ sub : comp1 ] , [ sub : comp2 ] and [ sub : comp3 ] .",
    "the initial configurations of the system to be simulated are first energy - minimized by iteratively adjusting the atomic coordinates to achieve local potential energy minimum .",
    "after that , the systems are equilibrated at 300 k for 300 000 steps ( 0.15 ns )",
    ". then they are heated to a common temperature @xmath2  k but at different rates @xmath3 determined by the number of steps @xmath4 , where @xmath5 0.5 - 4 million steps , with an interval of 0.5 million steps .",
    "the heating rate and steps are simply related via @xmath6 , @xmath4 is step in million , since there is an initial 300,000 step at @xmath7=300 k for equilibration .",
    "the coordinates during the md are saved at every 2000 steps ( 1 ps ) for post - processing .",
    "figure  [ fig3b ] illustrates the variation of temperature @xmath7 of the system up to @xmath8 for different @xmath9 .",
    "the temporal evolution in the md simulation of a given graphene sheet is followed at each heating rate . in particular",
    ", the temperature at which melting occurs at a fixed heating rate is monitored . for cases where melting did not occur up to 6000  k ,",
    "@xmath8 is set to 7000  k. following this procedure , the heating rate dependence of the melting temperature could be determined . in general",
    ", the slower the heating rate is the longer it takes to achieve the final target temperature , hence more time is available for better equilibration . at any finite heating rate , overheating is expected . usually , the larger the heating rate the higher is the melting temperature , such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pevsstep](d ) .",
    "ercolessi @xcite discussed about the consequence of estimating the melting temperature of a substance by increasing the temperature until the caloric curve exhibits a jump .",
    "it was commented that the temperature where the jump occurs is usually higher than the true melting temperature due to the lacking of liquid seed .",
    "hence the melting temperature estimated using this procedure should be regarded as an upper bound .",
    "the ultimate melting temperature in principle should be independent of heating rate .",
    "melting temperatures obtained at a finite heating rate should converge to a unique value in the limit of vanishing heating rate ( or equivalently , @xmath10 ) .",
    "this can be achieved by numerical extrapolation . in the present work ,",
    "the heating - rate - independent melting temperature is derived by extrapolate the data points of the rate - dependent melting temperatures in fig .",
    "[ fig : pevsstep](b ) to @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 refers to the melting temperature of a finite sheet heated with rate @xmath3 .",
    "we commented that many graphene melting simulations reported in the literature either did not report the investigation of the convergence of the melting temperature against heating rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or just allowed the melting temperature to vary with heating rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such practice could potentially render some degree of arbitrariness in their reported melting temperatures .",
    "this heating procedure is free from the choices of heating rate .",
    "it provides a complementary check against the simulations done via the direct - heating protocol .",
    "systems to be investigated are first energy - minimized and then equilibrated at 300  k for 300  000 steps .",
    "the temperature of the systems are then rapidly ramped up to a predetermined target temperature @xmath14 , at which they are equilibrated for a sufficiently lengthy period of time . at the end of the lengthy equilibration ,",
    "the temperature is rapidly quenched to 300 k at approximately 1 k per 100 steps .",
    "the process is repeated for a set of @xmath14 ranging from 4000  k to 7000  k at an interval of 50  k. at each @xmath14 the temporal evolution of the system is monitored for any occurrence of melting phenomena .",
    "the length of the equilibration at the @xmath14 plateau , @xmath15 , is carefully chosen such that all systems being simulated would either completely melted or remain intact at the end of the equilibration . by this way",
    "we can straight forwardly tell whether a system melts , or otherwise , at a fixed @xmath14 .",
    "the lengthiest equilibration period lasted for 5 ns . since in this approach @xmath14",
    "is usually set to be very high , the averaged fluctuation in the temperature @xmath7 during the equilibration plateau is also quite large ( approximately in the range of 50  k - 100  k ) , rendering it not feasible to set a temperature resolution of less than 50  k. fig .",
    "[ fig.3.2 ] shows an example of temperature profile throughout the simulation for target temperature of 4000  k.    temprofile      to determine the melting temperature of a system heated using direct - heating protocol , two quantitative indicators obtainable in the simulations , namely , ( _ i _ ) the rate of change in the potential energy @xmath16 , and ( _ ii _ ) heat capacity @xmath17 , both as a function of step , are monitored at a heating rate @xmath3 .    1 .   to obtain melting temperature by monitoring the potential energy @xmath16 , its average for every three steps is calculated .",
    "melting temperature is taken as the temperature at which the maximum rate of change in @xmath16 occurs .",
    "a typical variation of @xmath16 a function of step at a fixed heating rate @xmath3 is shown in fig .",

    "there is an apparent disparity between the results from the first experiment and that of the second and third experiments .",
    "the disparity may be due to the differences in the technical details in these md simulations .",
    "the main differences between these experiments is that the finite graphenes in the first experiment have edges that are absent in the second and third experiments , which adopt periodic boundary condition .",

    "based on the overall results of the md experiments conducted , we have illustrated that estimating melting temperature of infinite graphene sheet by extrapolating the melting temperature of finite graphene sheets does not yield result consistent with that obtained with periodically constructed infinite graphene , probably because an infinite graphene sheet without any edge can not be trivially mimicked by simply extrapolating the finite size to infinity , or at least , not until only 5000 atoms ( which is the largest finite graphene size affordable by our present computational resource ) .",
