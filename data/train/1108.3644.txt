    "based upon the second law of thermodynamics carnot proposed that every cyclic engines should consist of at least two reservoirs with two distinct temperatures , namely high and low temperature reservoirs .",
    "the former supplies entropy accompanying heat into the engine , while the latter absorbs the supplied entropy to eliminate it from the engine .",
    "it has been shown , however , that the engine proposed by szilard @xcite , referred to as the szilard engine ( sze ) , can be operated by using only a single reservoir , so that it was regarded as the so - called maxwell s demon @xcite which is believed to violate the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the thermodynamic cycle of the sze consists of three steps as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; ( a ) to insert a wall so as to divide a box into two parts , ( b ) to perform measurement to obtain information on which side the atom is in , and ( c ) to attach a weight to the wall to extract work via isothermal expansion with a thermal reservoir of temperature @xmath0 contacted .",
    "now it is widely accepted that the sze does not contradict the second law since the _ information _ entropy of the sze is transferred to the reservoir via measurement and erasure mediated by the demon @xcite .",
    "the second law thus forces us to directly relate information to physical entropy , which reveals a profound role of information in nature .",
    "the sze has been exploited to understand many physical problems in various contexts @xcite and realized in experiment @xcite .    .",
    "[ fig1],width=453 ]    the third law of thermodynamics , proposed by nernst in @xmath1 @xcite , asserts that the entropy of a substance approaches zero as temperature approaches absolute zero .",
    "this statement is true only if the ground state of the substance is unique . otherwise , the entropy approaches non - zero finite value called as the residual entropy .",
    "many quantum statistical behavior in low temperature , e.g. the specific heat of solids , is governed by the third law .",
    "however , it is now found that the third law is a derived law rather than a fundamental law .",
    "interestingly there is no study on the relation between the information and the third law .",
    "moreover , it has never even been asked what the role of the third law is in the context of the information heat engine , especially the sze . in the classical sze , the entropy production defined as",
    "the work extracted from the engine divided by temperature is independent of temperature .    in this paper",
    "we show that the third law of thermodynamics manifests itself in the sze , particularly in the low temperature .",
    "the entropy production is limited by the third law ; the entropy production vanishes as temperature approaches zero .",
    "exception occurs when the ground state exhibits degeneracies either by accidence or due to symmetry .",
    "the entropy production then approaches a non - zero finite value completely determined by the number of the degeneracies .",
    "moreover , various non - trivial temperature dependence of the entropy production of the quantum sze containing bosons or fermions with or without interaction can be understood by considering the third law and such degeneracies . through this paper",
    "we assume that all the measurement is performed in a perfect manner .",
    "how the imperfect measurement modifies the results of the classical sze has been investigated in ref .",
    "the non - equilibrium effect in the classical sze has also been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the work formula of the quantum sze and discuss one tricky point of when and how the measurement has been done during the thermodynamic process .",
    "section iii is the main part of this paper .",
    "we show the role of the third law in the sze and present the simplest model , one particle sze . in sec .",
    "iv , we investigate various physical situations of two particle sze , which shows rich behaviors of a simple information heat engine in the low temperature .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper .",
    "to correctly address the behavior of the sze in low temperature , we should deal with it in a quantum mechanical way .",
    "recently it has been found by one of us that the work of the quantum sze is expressed as @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the probability to find @xmath5 atoms in the left side of the box among total @xmath6 atoms right after a wall is inserted for the time - forward protocol , and that for the time - reversed protocol , respectively .",
    "here @xmath7 , @xmath0 and @xmath8 denote the boltzmann constant , the temperature of a heat reservoir and the entropy production , respectively .",
    "recently we reported , however , that eq .",
    "( [ eq : work ] ) itself can be derived from fully classical consideration .",
    "the partition functions , required to calculate @xmath9 and @xmath10 , differ in whether the classical or the quantum mechanics are taken into account @xcite .",
    "all the calculations performed in this paper are based upon eq .",
    "( [ eq : work ] ) .",
    "now we would like to address one frequently asked question on the sze : when and how the measurement process has been done during the thermodynamic process .",
    "the answer is that the measurement is automatically done by the reservoir when the box is completely separated into two parts by inserting a wall .",
    "it is noted that the process of inserting a wall should be performed in an isothermal way in the quantum sze , which inevitably introduces the reservoir into the problem @xcite . in order to make the engine have a well - defined temperature at every moment the reservoir has to observe the eigenenergy of the engine so that each energy eigenstate is properly occupied following the canonical distribution .",
    "below we show that such a measurement of the energy corresponds to that of the information on which part of box the particle is located in when the wall is inserted .",
    "the engine and the wall can be modeled as an one - dimensional box and a potential barrier , respectively ; that is , @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hight of the wall . for simplicity",
    "assume that temperature is negligibly small so that only the ground state is dominantly occupied .",
    "when @xmath13 is large enough , the ground and the first excited state , denoted as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , are nearly degenerate so as to be almost equally occupied . thus the density operator is written as @xmath16 now we introduce @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , which describes a localized state in the left ( right ) side of the box , as follows latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     explicitly @xmath17 is written as @xmath20 @xmath18 can be given in a similar way with the probability localized in the right side .",
    "one can then show that eq .",
    "( [ eq : density matrix 1,2 ] ) is mathematically equivalent to @xmath21 it means that the state is now represented as the probability mixture of the left and the right side .",
    "it is thus no need to perform any additional measurement on which side the particle is in since it has already been done by the reservoir .",
    "when the wall is completely inserted the state of the engine is not a coherent superposition of two states @xmath17 and @xmath18 but rather their probability mixture .",
    "the similar argument can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where once the wall is completely inserted the reservoir is contacted with the engine in order to perform the isothermal expansion . in our case , however , the reservoir should be contacted during the whole process of inserting a wall .",
    "here we prove that the entropy production , @xmath8 , is bounded by the entropy of a system , @xmath22 , which guarantees that @xmath8 vanishes as @xmath22 vanishes .",
    "when the wall is inserted , the entropy of the system is expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents the probability that the system has a discrete energy @xmath25 when @xmath5 atoms reside in the left side of the box , and @xmath26 in the right .",
    "according to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the conditional probability that the system has an energy @xmath25 , once @xmath5 atoms are found in the left side , one finds @xmath29 where @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are exploited . as temperature approaches zero , the entropy of system @xmath22 and accordingly @xmath8 approach zero due to the third law .",
    "now we consider the sze containing a single atom with the wall inserted at @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the distance between the wall and the left end of the box , and the size of the box , respectively . here",
    "the box is modeled as an infinite potential well .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the entropy productions of the quantum sze for various @xmath36 vanish as @xmath37 except @xmath38 .",
    "note that the entropy production of the classical sze remains constant , i.e. a binary entropy @xmath39 , independent of temperature .",
    "the deviation of the entropy production between the quantum and the classical sze becomes prominent around @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the @xmath42th eigenenergy of the left ( right ) side of the box ( @xmath43 ) , namely @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath5 are the planck constant and a mass of the atom , respectively .",
    "the reason is that if @xmath47 is larger ( smaller ) than @xmath48 the left ( right ) side of the box is predominantly occupied once @xmath49 is satisfied .",
    "this is confirmed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where @xmath8 scaled by @xmath50 as a function of @xmath0 scaled by @xmath51 coalesce with each other for all @xmath36 , and all the curves start to bend at @xmath52 .",
    "it should be noted that it was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that the work of the quantum sze is exactly equivalent to that of the classical one as far as a single atom is concerned .",
    "this statement is true only if the wall is inserted precisely at @xmath38 , at which the ground state exhibits the degeneracy due to the reflection symmetry .",
    "the entropy production associated with this degeneracy exactly corresponds to the classical one , namely @xmath53 . in a generic case ,",
    "i.e. @xmath54 , however , the quantum result should deviate from the classical due to the third law .     of the quantum sze with a single atom as a function of @xmath55 for @xmath38 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 from top to bottom , where @xmath60 .",
    "( inset ) the same data scaled by @xmath50 for @xmath61-aix and @xmath51 for @xmath34-axis .",
    "[ fig2],width=321 ]    let us discuss the meaning of the vanishing entropy production due to the third law in the context of information entropy .",
    "as temperature goes to zero , only the ground state becomes dominantly occupied . for @xmath62 , the ground state is located in the right side due to @xmath63 .",
    "thus it is no doubt that the atom occupies the ground state of the right side at zero temperature so that the atom should be found in the right without any uncertainty . in the viewpoint of information",
    "the entropy is zero since there is no uncertainty for the location of the atom .",
    "it also means one can not transfer any information or entropy to the reservoir by performing measurement and erasure .",
    "therefore , the work can not be extracted from the engine .",
    "if more than one atom is considered , the quantum statistical nature such as bosons and fermions comes into play .",
    "however , the third law still governs the low temperature behavior of the entropy production .",
    "when the ground state of the system is unique , the entropy production of two atoms vanishes at zero temperature no matter what they are bosons or fermions .      in the case of bosons ,",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state occurs when the reflection symmetry takes place , that is , @xmath64 .",
    "the vanishing entropy production then becomes prominent for @xmath65 , which is clearly shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] presenting the entropy production of two non - interacting spin-@xmath66 bosons .",
    "note here that there exists another energy scale @xmath67 , at which the entropy production starts to increases as @xmath0 decreases although it is not so dramatic in the inset of fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "this rather peculiar behavior is associated with the residual entropy @xmath68 appearing at @xmath38 at @xmath69 @xcite , which is larger than the entropy production in the high temperature limit , namely @xmath53 . as temperature decreases @xmath8 first increases around @xmath70 and then decreases around @xmath71 ( see the dashed curve in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "such behavior becomes obscure when @xmath72 ( see the dashed dotted curve in the inset of fig .

    "( a ) the schematic diagram of energy levels at @xmath79 . the filled circle represents the ground state",
    "is occupied by one fermion while two dotted circles denote two possible ways the second fermion can occupy the next state .",
    "[ fig3],width=321 ]    two fermions exhibit completely different behavior .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that the entropy production of two non - interacting _ spinless _ fermions approaches zero even for @xmath74 .",
    "the reason is that the ground state of two fermions is non - degenerate due to the pauli s exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "however , at @xmath79 as temperature decreases the entropy production first decreases but finally approaches @xmath53 ( see the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this unexpected behavior is ascribed to the accidental degeneracy between the ground state of the left side and the first excited state of the right as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "one fermion then occupies the ground state of the right while the second fermion is allowed to occupy either the left or the right , which contributes to entropy by @xmath53 .",
    "let us now consider more realistic situations , namely two spin - zero bosons with either attractive or repulsive interaction and two spin-@xmath80 fermions with either ferromagnetic or anti - ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "it is not surprising that the results will become more complicated .",
    "however , the basic principle is the same as before : how the entropy production behaves in the low temperature limit is completely determined by the third law .",
    "now we have one more energy scale , i.e. the interaction energy .",
    "make sure that the work can still be expressed as eq .",
    "( [ eq : work ] ) even if the interaction between atoms takes place .     of the classical sze of two distinguishable particles with the attractive ( the solid curve ) and the repulsive interaction ( the dashed curve ) and of the quantum sze of two spin-@xmath66 bosons with the attractive ( the dotted curve ) and the repulsive interaction ( the dashed - dotted curve ) as a function of @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",

    "this is indeed equivalent to the single atom case studied above , and becomes pronounced when @xmath86 .",
    "the slight increase of @xmath8 larger than @xmath53 ( the dotted curve of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) is a classical effect ( see the solid curve of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . even in the classical case",
    "it is more likely for two atoms to reside at the same side when the attractive interaction exists , from which configuration one can extract more entropy production than a non - interacting case . for the repulsive interaction ,",
    "the residual entropy at zero temperature is zero since for @xmath87 two bosons considerably repel each other like two spinless fermions discussed above ( see the dashed - dotted curve of fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
