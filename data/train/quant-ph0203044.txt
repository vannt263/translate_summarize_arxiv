    "the well known simultaneous - move bimatrix game of prisoners dilemma ( pd ) has attracted early attention @xcite in the recent studies in quantum game theory . in classical game theory",
    "@xcite a two - stage repeated version of this game consists of the two players playing the game twice , observing the outcome of the first play before the second play begins .",
    "the payoffs for the entire game are simply taken as the sum of the payoffs from the two stages .",
    "generally a two - stage repeated game has more complex strategic structure than its one - stage counterpart and players strategic choices in the second stage are affected by the outcome of their moves in the first stage . for the classical one - stage pd game",
    "the strategy of ` defection ' by both the players is well known as a unique nash equilibrium ( ne ) . in its two - stage version",
    "the same ne appears again at the second stage because the first stage payoffs are added as constants to the second stage .",
    "in fact in all of the finitely repeated versions of the pd game the strategy of ` defection ' by both the players appears as unique ne at every stage @xcite .",
    "recent interesting and important study of the one - stage quantum pd game by eisert , wilkens , and lewenstein @xcite makes one to ask a question : what can be a possible role for quantum mechanics when the game is played twice ?",
    "it appears that this role should be relevant to the new feature showing itself in the game i.e. the two - stages .",
    "a role for quantum mechanics exists if it inter - links the two stages of the game in some way of interest .",
    "classically both the players ` defect ' at each stage and the strategic choices remain the same because of the uniqueness of the ne at each stage . in our search for the quantum role we found useful to study the idea of _ subgame - perfect outcome _ ( sgpo ) @xcite in a two - stage repeated bimatrix game in its quantum form .",
    "for a two - stage repeated game the idea of a sgpo is the natural analog of the _ backwards - induction outcome _ ( bio ) @xcite studied in games of complete and perfect information . in a recent paper @xcite we considered the bio idea in a quantum form of duopoly game and showed how entanglement can give an outcome corresponding to static form of the duopoly even when the game is played dynamically . in the present paper",
    "we study the natural analogue of bio for a two - stage repeated pd quantum game , i.e. , the idea of sgpo in a situation that can be said to lie in quantum domain .",
    "we solve the two - stage pd quantum game in the spirit of backwards induction studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but now the first step in working backwards from the end of the game involves solving a real game rather than solving a single - person optimization problem as done in ref .",
    "classically the idea of sgpo comes out as a stronger solution concept especially when multiple ne appear in a stage .",
    "our motivation is the observation that a quantization scheme for the pd game is known where the ne in a stage does not remain unique , thus making relevant a consideration of the concept of sgpo in the two - stage game played in a quantum setting . for the purpose of completeness",
    ", we will first describe how sgpo works for the classical two - stage pd game .",
    "afterwards , we quantize the game using a known scheme , and then , show how a sgpo can exist that is counter - intuitive compared to the classical sgpo for the two - stage repeated pd game .",
    "like the dynamic game of complete and perfect information for example the stackelberg duopoly analyzed in ref . @xcite the play in a two - stage game of complete but imperfect information proceeds in a sequence of two stages , with the moves in the first - stage observed before the next stage begins .",
    "the new feature is that within each stage there are now simultaneous moves .",
    "the simultaneity of moves within each stage means that information is imperfect in the game .",
    "a two - stage game of complete but imperfect information consists of the following steps",
    "@xcite :    1 .",
    "players @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously choose actions @xmath2 and @xmath3 from feasible sets @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "2 .   players @xmath0 and @xmath1 observe the outcome of the first stage , @xmath6 , and then simultaneously choose actions @xmath7 and @xmath8 from feasible sets @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "payoffs are @xmath9 for @xmath10 @xmath1 .",
    "a usual approach to solve a game from this class uses the method of backwards induction . in ref .",
    "@xcite the first step in working backwards involves solving a single - person optimization problem .",
    "now the first step involves solving the real simultaneous - move game between players @xmath11 and @xmath1 in the second stage , given the outcome from stage one . if the players @xmath0 and @xmath1 anticipate that their second - stage behavior will be given by @xmath12 , then the first - stage interaction between players @xmath0 and @xmath1 amounts to the following simultaneous - move game :    1 .",
    "players @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously choose actions @xmath2 and @xmath3 from feasible sets @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "payoffs are @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath15 is the unique ne of this simultaneous - move game , the    @xmath16 is known as the sgpo @xcite of this two - stage game .",
    "this outcome is the natural analog of the bio in games of complete and perfect information .",
    "we use a normal form of the pd game given by the following matrix @xcite    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are for the strategies of ` cooperation ' and ` defection ' respectively .",
    "the players play this simultaneous - move game twice .",
    "the outcome of the first play is observed before the second stage begins .",
    "the payoff for the entire game is simply the sum of the payoffs from the two stages .",
    "it is a two - stage game of complete but imperfect information @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the probabilities with which the pure strategy @xmath18 is played by the players @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , in the stage @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the probabilities with which the pure strategy @xmath18 is played by the players @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , in the stage @xmath21 .",

    ", we analyze the first stage of this two - stage pd game by taking into account the fact that the outcome of the game remaining in the second stage will be the ne of that remaining game namely , @xmath32 . at this",

    "therefore , the unique sgpo of the two - stage pd game is @xmath34 in the first stage , followed by @xmath34 in the second stage .",
    "the strategy of defection in both stages appears as the sgpo for two - stage classical pd game .",
    "we now see how it becomes possible in a quantum form of this two - stage pd game to achieve a sgpo in which the players decide to cooperate in the first stage while knowing that they will both defect in the second",
    ". the quantum form of the two - stage pd game is played using a system of four qubits .",
    "players moves are given by manipulation of these qubits by two unitary and hermitian operators ( identity and inversion operator ) in marinatto and weber s scheme @xcite to play a quantum form of a matrix game .",
    "a quantum version of a two - stage game must have the corresponding classical two - stage game as a subset @xcite .",
    "a scheme where this requirement is satisfied via a control of the initial state is the marinatto and weber s idea of playing a quantum version of a matrix game @xcite .",
    "the scheme was proposed originally to play a quantum form of a one - stage bimatrix game of the battle of sexes .",
    "the fundamental idea can be extended to play a two - stage version of a bimatrix game .",
    "for example , the two - stage quantum version of the pd game starts by making available a 4-qubit pure quantum state to the players .",
    "this state can be written as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are identifying symbols for four qubits .",
    "the upper and lower states of a qubit are @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively and @xmath39 are complex numbers .",
    "it is a quantum state in @xmath40 dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we suppose the qubits @xmath41 and @xmath42 are manipulated by the players in the first stage of the game and , similarly , the qubits @xmath43 and @xmath38 are manipulated in the second stage .",

    "the inversion operator @xmath18 is , then , applied @xcite with probabilities @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "the players action in the first stage changes @xmath44 to    @xmath49    we suppose that the actions of the players in this stage are simultaneous and they remember their moves ( i.e. the numbers @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) in the next stage also . in the second stage",
    "the players @xmath0 and @xmath1 apply the identity operator with the probabilities @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , on @xmath50 .",
    "the inversion operator @xmath18 is , then , applied with probabilities @xmath51 and @xmath52 on @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "@xmath20 shows the overall idea of playing the two - stage game .",
    "one notices that the moves or actions of the players in the two stages of the game are done on two different pairs of qubits .",
    "after the moves of the second stage the quantum state changes to    @xmath54    the state @xmath55 is now ready for a measurement , giving payoffs for the two stages of the game .",
    "if classically the bimatrix game ( [ matrix1 ] ) is played at each stage , the possession of the following four payoff operators by the ` measuring agent ' corresponds to a quantum version of the two - stage game :    @xmath56 _ { 1 } & = & \\underset{k , l=1,2}{\\sum } % \\left\\ { 3\\left| 11kl\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 11kl\\right| + 5\\left| 21kl\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 21kl\\right| + \\left| 22kl\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 22kl\\right| \\right\\ }   \\notag \\\\ \\left [ \\left ( p_{a}\\right ) _ { oper}\\right ] _ { 2 } & = & \\underset{i , j=1,2}{\\sum } % \\left\\ { 3\\left| ij11\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle ij11\\right| + 5\\left| ij21\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle ij21\\right|",
