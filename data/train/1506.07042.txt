    "markus bttiker was certainly one of the most influential scientists in the field of mesoscopic physics . among all his important contributions ,",
    "time in quantum mechanics has a peculiar flavor since it occupied his mind at the right beginning and at the end of his carrier .",
    "intrigued at first by the traversal time of an electron through a tunnel barrier @xcite , he came back to this topic after the emergence of `` on - demand single electron sources '' @xcite , which he greatly contributed to develop @xcite , via the concept of waiting time distribution ( wtd ) @xcite .",
    "charge transport at the nanoscale is known to be stochastic due to the quantum nature of particles @xcite .",
    "therefore , going beyond the knowledge of average quantities , such as the average electronic current , appears to be unavoidable and extremely fruitful at the same time .",
    "a deep physical insight can indeed be inferred from the fluctuations of the signal and extracted from various observables .",
    "noise @xcite and full counting statistics ( fcs ) @xcite , namely the second moment of current fluctuations and the statistics of charges transferred during a long time interval , are among the most popular quantities and have been proved to be powerful tools . with the development of electron quantum optics @xcite and the progress in single electron detection at high frequencies @xcite",
    ", it is now relevant and possible to consider electron dynamics and time resolved quantities at quantum mechanical time scales ( typically nano - seconds and below ) .",
    "therefore , new theoretical tools have been developed to describe the current fluctuations at such time scales , such as finite frequency noise @xcite and fcs @xcite , wigner functions @xcite , or the wtd @xcite .",
    "the latter , describes the statistical distribution of time intervals between the detection of two electrons and therefore gives accurate information about correlations between subsequent electrons .",
    "is set to an energy @xmath0 above the fermi energy of the normal part and the gap @xmath1 is much larger than the potential difference @xmath0 . ]",
    "the wtd has been studied for particularly simple systems like single and multiple electronic quantum channels connected to two normal leads via a quantum point contact ( qpc ) @xcite , a quantum capacitor @xcite , a double quantum dot @xcite , a train of lorentzian pulses @xcite or a quantum dot connected to a normal and a superconducting lead @xcite , among others . in this paper",
    "we revisit the physics of normal - superconducting ( ns ) junction through the point of view of waiting times in order to illustrate the effect of superconducting correlations and entanglement @xcite on their distribution . indeed , as we will discuss later , such a system may emit entangled electrons in the normal part , and leads to interesting features in the wtd .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe the model used for the ns junction and the formalism needed for computing the wtd . in sec . [",
    "sec : onespin ] , we discuss the effect of the transparency of the barrier ( the energy dependence of the andreev reflection ) when the detection process is sensitive to only one electronic spin species and a certain range of energy .",
    "section [ sec : twospins ] is devoted to the effect of entanglement between spin up and spin down electrons emitted from the superconducting part , on the wtds .",
    "we finally conclude and discuss some perspectives in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "moreover , for the sake of clarity , technical details are moved to the appendices .",
    "[ app : a ] demonstrates the formal analogy between our setup and a single quantum channel conductor for a specific detection process whereas important steps for the numerical and analytical calculations of the wtd in the entangled case are explained in [ app : b ] .",
    "one very important consequence of superconductivity is the existence of andreev reflection .",
    "such a phenomenon arises because the superconducting device can not accommodate any single particle excitation with energy below the gap @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , if a single particle like an electron or a hole flows from the normal part to the superconducting part with an energy below this threshold it can only be scattered back at the interface . however , there are now two possibilities .",
    "an electron ( a hole ) can be either normally reflected ( specular reflection ) , that is to say , reflected as an electron ( a hole ) or converted to a hole ( an electron ) .",
    "this is the so called andreev reflection which originates from the fact that the incoming electron finds a partner to create a cooper pair which can enter in the superconductor and leave a hole behind .    to be more specific , the system of interest is a polarized ns junction ( with an s - wave superconductor ) , at zero temperature , as presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the superconductor chemical potential @xmath2 is set to be at a potential @xmath0 above the fermi level @xmath3 of the normal metal .",
    "in such a situation , there is an incident hole , coming from the metal , that can be either normally reflected or andreev reflected as an electron .",
    "another way of picturing the andreev effect is to think about the inverse configuration where a cooper pair in the superconductor ( at energy @xmath2 and zero momentum for an s - wave superconductor ) splits at the interface and gives birth to an entangled pair of electrons . from now on",
    ", we will take @xmath0 much smaller than the superconducting gap @xmath1 in order to focus on this sub - gap phenomenon .",
    "this also has the benefit to make the andreev time @xmath4 ( the typical time needed for an andreev event ) much smaller than @xmath5 ( the typical time separation of two single particle wave packets emitted in the normal metal @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us to assume that andreev events are instantaneous and make use of scattering theory .",
    "in addition , this assumption allows one to linearize the dispersion relation around @xmath2 as @xmath6 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 measured from @xmath2 and its corresponding momentum ( or around the fermi level since @xmath9 and @xmath2 ) .    at the interface ,",
    "the scattering is in general not perfect and both normal and andreev reflection will play a role . in order to describe this effect , we use the standard blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) model @xcite which has been widely used in the literature .",
    "the junction is modeled by a point - like barrier potential @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fermi wavelength and @xmath12 is a parameter measuring the strength of the barrier .",
    "it is then possible to compute the scattering matrix of this setup exactly and obtain the normal and andreev transmission / reflection coefficients @xcite .",
    "we do not reproduce these results in the present paper but give the corresponding numerical values of the coefficients when necessary .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] illustrates the scattering processes that we are now going to describe mathematically .",
    "the incident holes of energies @xmath13 lying between @xmath3 and @xmath14 , arriving from the left and propagating to the right will be either normally reflected as holes of the same energies with amplitude @xmath15 or andreev reflected as electrons of energies @xmath16 with amplitude @xmath17 .",
    "the incoming scattering state is therefore a slater determinant of holes of the form @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for the filled fermi sea up to @xmath2 in the normal part .",
    "however , in the electron language , this state is just the fermi sea @xmath20 filled up to @xmath3 instead of @xmath2 . in the following",
    ", we will rather use the electronic picture to simplify the notation but both pictures are equivalent @xcite . due to scattering at the interface ,",
    "the outgoing state is therefore a superposition of reflected holes , entangled electrons and non - entangled electrons @xcite @xmath21 indeed , it is pretty straightforward to see that the previous equation , for a given energy , gives birth to three kinds of term with different levels of complexity .",
    "the terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 correspond to non - entangled contributions whereas @xmath24 describes fully entangled electrons originating from the splitting of a cooper pair at the interface .",
    "when andreev reflection is absent ( @xmath25 ) , the fermi sea is unperturbed by the interface and nothing interesting happens .",
    "counter - intuitively , perfect andreev reflection does not lead to perfect entanglement . on the contrary",
    ", the state is a slater determinant of non - entangled electrons and the ns junction acts as a conventionnal electron source @xcite .",
    "it appears that the maximally entangled situation arises when andreev and normal reflection probabilities are both equal to one half .",
    "nevertheless , the wtd of a fully entangled state has never been studied to our knowledge and we will take the opportunity to study it in this paper before considering the general and more realistic state emitted at the interface .    in order to conclude this section , we recall a few definitions about wtds . as mentioned in the introduction , the waiting time @xmath26 is defined as the time delay between the detection of two single particles . due to scattering and the quantum nature of particles ,",
    "this time is a random variable , which distribution ( the wtd ) brings an elegant and instructive picture of the physics . for stationary systems , namely when there is no explicit time dependence , the wtd @xmath27 depends on @xmath26 only ( and not on absolute time ) and is closely related to the idle time probability ( itp ) @xmath28 , the probability to detect no electron during a time interval @xmath26    @xmath29    where @xmath30^{-1}_{\\tau=0}$ ] is the mean waiting time @xcite . to go further",
    ", we must now specify the detection procedure to compute the wtd .",
    "in what follows we will assume perfect single electron projective measurement but will consider two different situations as described below .",
    "such perfect detection process is still theoretical and extremely challenging at very short time scales ( nano - second and below ) but recent experiments @xcite are very promising about this issue . in order to compute the itp ,",
    "we regularize the scattering problem as usual @xcite .",
    "we discretize energy , ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath0 , in @xmath32 slices and wave vectors as @xmath33 and consider the limit @xmath34 to mimic a stationary process .",
    "the first application of this setup will be to measure the wtd of holes via the detection of andreev reflected electrons or in other words the wtd of andreev events @xcite .",
    "a single electron detector is located at a position @xmath35 far away from the interface . in this section",
    "we assume that the detector measures only one spin orientation that we will choose upward for concreteness .",
    "moreover , we make the additional assumption that it is only sensitive to energies above @xmath2 , using a quantum dot for instance @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "this allows us to avoid complications due to entanglement @xcite , which will be the subject of the next section .",
    "following @xcite , the itp is defined as    @xmath36    with the explicit condition that only electrons with energies above @xmath2 contribute . here",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 stands for the normal ordering . in principle , the itp can not be reduced to a single determinant since the many body state is not a slater determinant . however , according to the assumptions introduced above , only one term survives and the final result can be cast as a single determinant @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "entanglement no longer plays a role and the problem thus boils down to a single quantum channel with energy dependent transmission @xcite , where the role of the energy - dependent transparency @xmath39 of the qpc is played here by @xmath40 , the andreev reflection amplitude ( see [ app : a ] for details ) .",
    "is increased , @xmath41 decreases from one to zero as shown in the inset . for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and",
    "the wtd is described by the wigner distribution ( blue dots , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wigner ] ) ) .",
    "close to perfect specular reflection ( @xmath44 ) the distribution approaches an exponential law except for very small times ( black squares ) . for intermediate @xmath12 ,",
    "small oscillations with period @xmath45 are superimposed to an exponential decay .",
    "together , with the dip at @xmath46 , they are manifestations of pauli s exclusion principle @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we have plotted the spin up electronic wtd for different barriers strengths @xmath42 ( perfect andreev reflection ) , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( strong barrier ) as a function of @xmath49 . for information we show as an inset the corresponding andreev reflection coefficient @xmath50 as a function of energy",
    ". however , the energy dependence is very weak since the energy window @xmath0 is supposed to be much smaller than the superconducting gap @xmath1 .",
    "as expected , the wtd for @xmath42 is approximately given by the wigner surmise @xcite    @xmath51\\,.\\ ] ]    indeed , in that case the train of free holes is perfectly converted at the interface into free electrons which are described by random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "as @xmath12 is increased , the distribution is broadened since @xmath41 is no longer equal to one and therefore not all holes are converted into electrons .",
    "the situation is exactly equivalent to free electrons injected into a single quantum channel and partitioned by a quantum point contact with transmission probability @xmath41 due to the electron - hole symmetry in the system .",
    "the difference is only conceptual since here the detector is measuring indirectly the statistics of holes converted into electrons by the ns junction that acts as an andreev mirror .",
    "finally , for large @xmath12 , namely , small andreev reflection , most of the holes are normally reflected and the detector collects rare events which are almost uncorrelated and the wtd is exponential ( except for very short times ) .",
    "indeed , following @xcite we derive the asymptotic behavior of the wtd in the long time limit .",
    "for @xmath43 the decay is gaussian with algebraic corrections well described by the wigner surmise and for partial andreev reflection ( @xmath52 ) it is exponential with a rate given by the geometrical mean of the logarithm of @xmath53 over energy in @xmath54 $ ] , namely @xmath55\\ , g(\\tau/\\overline\\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is an oscillatory function that decays as @xmath57 and depends on @xmath58 .    to conclude this section",
    ", we note that the role of electrons and holes may be interchanged by inverting the polarization ( @xmath59 ) due to electron - hole symmetry .",
    "we now move a step forward and discuss the effect of entanglement on waiting times .",
    "as mentioned before , andreev reflection might be thought in terms of splitting of a cooper pairs in the vicinity of the interface , leading to the injection of two entangled electrons with opposite spins and energy ( with respect to @xmath2 ) in the normal part as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( left part ) .",
    "however , we have seen that the scattering state ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiout ] ) ) is a mixture of entangled and non - entangled components which makes the effect of entanglement hard to separate from other physical ingredients .",
    "therefore , we focus here on the wtd of the fully entangled state of the form    @xmath60 \\vert f \\rangle\\,,\\ ] ]    even if this is not the real quantum state emitted at the interface .",
    "indeed , this work on ns junction rises a fundamental question of the effect of entanglement on waiting times that has never been considered to our knowledge and deserves to be investigated with proper care . at the end of this section",
    "we will give a few hints on how the additional terms included in the full state ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiout ] ) ) modify the picture but the common thread of this section will be the study of the fully entangled quantum state ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : psife ] ) ) . to point out the specific features of entanglement",
    ", we will compare this situation to the one of two independent electrons which would correspond to the emission of two electrons with opposite spins from a normal metal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] right ) @xcite .",
    "this time , the single electron detector is sensitive to both spins and energies between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "using the energy discretization mentioned before , the entangled state reads    @xmath63 \\ , \\vert f \\rangle\\ , , \\ ] ]    whereas non - entangled electrons emitted from a normal lead in an energy window @xmath0 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig3 ] right ) would be described by @xmath64 .        according to the detection process mentioned above , the itp is formally given by @xcite    @xmath65    where the quantum average is taken over the state @xmath66 or @xmath67 leading to @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . without any further assumption it is clear that the final result can not be expressed as a single determinant but rather as a sum of @xmath70 terms except in the non - entangled case where the itp factorizes to    @xmath71    where the averages are taken over the two spin sectors separately @xcite . indeed ,",
    "each term in the product of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psie ] ) can be split into two parts : @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 is then a sum of @xmath75 terms of the form @xmath76 , where @xmath77 can be either @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",
    "we shall denote a particular term by a string made of a succession of @xmath80 s and @xmath81 s defined as follows : @xmath82 .",
    "this is a slater determinant , while @xmath83 can not generally be cast as a simple slater determinant .",
    "@xmath84 will then be the sum of @xmath70 terms of the form , typically , @xmath85 , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 two generally different slater determinants . as previously shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , each @xmath88 is also a determinant .",
    "details about the procedure to calculate the itp are given in [ app : b ] .",
    "we now discuss our results obtained from a direct and exact enumeration of the @xmath70 terms in the itp .",
    "owing to the exponentially growing number of terms , this approach is limited to relatively small values of @xmath32 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4]a ) presents the wtd for increasing values of @xmath32 up to @xmath89 . as can be seen",
    ", the curves reasonably converge to a limiting distribution that would be obtained for @xmath90 . to insure this ,",
    "we have computed several finite size corrections that we will discuss later on .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4]b ) compares the wtds of entangled and non - entangled electrons @xcite which are qualitatively similar .",
    "however , as we will discuss in more detail in the next subsection , the maximum of the curve in the entangled case is more pronounced and closer to zero than in the independent case .",
    "the presence of such a peak in the wtd is the hallmark of pair rigidity due to entanglement . to be more quantitative",
    "we can evaluate the probability that the waiting time is smaller than the average waiting time @xmath91 ( which is the same in both situations ) .",
    "we find that this probability is about ten percent larger in the entangled case , demonstrating that the entangled electrons are more correlated than the non - entangled ones .",
    "the short time behavior is one of the most interesting characteristics of the wtd as it reflects the short time correlations encoded in the many body state and not the ones due to scattering .",
    "for free electrons it is universal since it is the expression of the pauli s principle .",
    "indeed , two spinless electrons can not be emitted in the same state which enforces the wtd to start from zero ( with a quadratic behavior ) . however ,",
    "if the electrons have other degrees of freedom like spin or if the mesoscopic conductor supports several channels , the wtd may start from a non - zero value but correlations are still visible and universal @xcite .",
    "however , these correlations only originate from electrons of the same channel and not between different channels .",
    "they eventually disappear in the limit of large number of independent channels @xcite .    .",

    "b ) comparison between the wtd of entangled electrons and non - entangled electrons ( see text ) .",
    "inset : short time behavior in the entangled case for @xmath89 ( full red line and green dashed line ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : stimewtd ] ) ) and @xmath94 ( black long dashed lines ) . ]    in order to get the short time expansion of the wtd up to second order in time , we need to expand the itp ( eq . ( [ eq : idle2 ] ) ) to fourth order in terms of moments of @xmath95 , @xmath96 and their products .",
    "this is a straightforward but somehow cumbersome calculation that we do not reproduce in detail here .",
    "after some algebra we obtain the short time expansion of the wtd , including finite size corrections .",
    "the final expression for @xmath97 reads , to second order in @xmath26    @xmath98\\ ] ]    where @xmath99 in the entangled case and one in the absence of ns junction .",
    "the insets of fig.[fig : fig4]a ) and fig.[fig : fig4]b ) show how this prediction is confirmed by our numerical evaluation of the wtd in the entangled case . in both situations , the wtd starts from the same initial value ( in the @xmath34 limit ) with a quadratic behavior but the coefficient is four times larger in the entangled case .",
    "again , this reflects the pair rigidity due to entanglement .",
    "differences between entangled and non - entangled electrons can also be inferred from the tail of the wtd . following the approach developed in @xcite we obtain the asymptotic behaviors of the wtd in the limit @xmath100 ( for details see [ app : b ] ) . in both cases",
    "we find a gaussian decay    @xmath101\\,,\\ ] ]    with @xmath102 a constant which is equal to one in the entangled case and two in the non - entangled case .",
    "therefore , the itp or equivalently the wtd decays more slowly in the entangled case , meaning that the two electrons are not at all independent .      as mentionned before ,",
    "entangled pairs are only one component of the real out - going scattering state which appears to be much more complex . for abritrary value of the reflection coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath41 , numerical evaluation of the wtd is pretty challenging since the number of terms grows as @xmath104 . in that case , direct numerical evaluations are restricted to very small values of @xmath32 ( typically 4 or 5 ) which is not sufficient to mimic a stationary situation .",
    "it is then necessary to resort to more sophisticated approaches like monte - carlo sampling of the itp for instance .",
    "however , there is a simple but rather interesting limit which is amenable to analytical calculations , namely the tunneling limit for @xmath44 @xmath105 . in that case",
    ", the full many - body state simplifies to @xcite    @xmath106|f\\rangle\\,,\\ ] ]    namely , to first non - trivial order in @xmath41 , it is made of scarce singlet pairs .",
    "following the same approach as before we obtain the small time behavior @xmath107\\ ] ] and the long time asymptotics @xmath108\\,.\\ ] ]    at short waiting times , the distribution starts from a constant value and the physics is dominated by correlations within a single cooper pair .",
    "indeed , simple considerations show that pairs are roughly separated in time by @xmath109 whereas electrons from the same pair are rather in a span of time of the order of @xmath110 .",
    "the situation is then akin to a single pair which has been studied by hassler et al .",
    "@xcite and confirms our predictions . at large time , the decay is exponential with a rate twice smaller than in the non - entangled case , which again is an hallmark of pair rigidity .",
    "we have presented a theory of waiting times in polarized ns junction at zero temperature . in this setup",
    ", andreev reflection brings new characteristic features in the wtd such as entanglement .",
    "if a detector is sensitive to only one type of spin and to energies above the superconductor chemical potential , the situation is reminiscent of a single quantum channel connected to two normal leads via a qpc with energy - dependent transmission .",
    "the interface acts as an andreev mirror and allows to measure the wtd of holes converted to electrons .",
    "however , if the detector measures electrons with both spins in the whole energy window above the fermi sea of the normal conductor , entanglement between electrons leaves fingerprints in the wtd .",
    "although still academical , we have focused on a fully entangled state which is only one component of the full many - body state flowing out of the ns interface . in that case ,",
    "such signatures are visible for both small and large waiting times but the most important feature is the existence of a peak in the wtd centered before the average waiting time . when taking into account all components of the scattering state , we have shown that some charateristics are still visible in the wtd in the tunneling limit .    in the near future , it would then be useful to extend this work beyond the ideal situation and the tunneling limit and evaluate the effect of entanglement for arbitrary values of reflection coefficients .",
    "in addition , a natural extensions would be to study correlations between waiting times of different spin species in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "this would probably yield an even clearer signature of entanglement than the wtd itself .    among other future investigations",
    ", it would be possible to study the effect of cross - andreev reflection in a superconducting - normal - superconducting junction or the physics brought by exotic states like majorana modes created by majorana guns @xcite .",
    "the paper is dedicated to the memory of markus bttiker who was very enthusiastic about the quantum theory of waiting times .",
