    "radial outward flows are dominant in the moat region that surrounds mature sunspots .",
    "moving magnetic features ( mmfs ) are small magnetic elements that have sizes of typically less than 2@xmath0 in the moat region @xcite .",
    "mmfs mostly appear around the penumbral outer boundary and then move almost radially outward in the moat region for mature and decaying sunspots @xcite .",
    "the lifetimes of mmfs range from a few minutes to 10 hr @xcite .",
    "those mmfs with longer lifetimes may reach the outer boundary of the moat region .",
    "recent observations suggest that mmfs located on lines extrapolated outward from the horizontal component of the penumbral magnetic fields into the moat region correspond to the photospheric intersections of undulating horizontal fields extending from the penumbra @xcite .",
    "this supports the `` sea serpent '' concept for mmfs , whereby the horizontal penumbral fields undulate into and out of the solar surface @xcite .",
    "many authors have proposed that the fluctuating penumbral fields and the subsequent mmfs are produced by evershed flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . on the other hand , mmfs located on the lines extrapolated from the penumbral spines have magnetic fields that are more vertical than those of their surroundings @xcite .",
    "such mmfs appear to be formed as a result of the detachment of a fraction of the magnetic field from the penumbral spines .",
    "the net magnetic flux transported by all the mmfs exceeds the flux - loss rate of the sunspot @xcite .",
    "hence , it has been suggested that the mmfs detached from the penumbral spines alone are the agent that removes magnetic flux from the sunspot ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "those mmfs might carry away an amount of magnetic flux sufficient to account for the flux loss of the sunspot @xcite .",

    "ar 10933 , figure  [ 20070104_sunspot ] shows the locations that we determined for the time - averaged penumbral outer boundary , the geometrical center of the sunspot , and the reference frame for the position angles around the sunspot center .",
    "the image averaged over all the g - band images was used to evaluate the average intensities of the quiet area , the penumbral outer boundary , and the central area of the sunspot .",
    "the quiet - area intensity ( @xmath5 ) was determined by a gaussian fit to the distribution of the intensities for pixels located well outside the sunspot .",
    "we spatially smoothed the averaged g - band image with a box of 5@xmath2 5@xmath0 to remove local fluctuations due to penumbral fine structure .",
    "let @xmath6 be the smoothed g - band intensity .",
    "we then define the average penumbral outer boundary as the locus of @xmath7 . in noaa",
    "ar 10933 , the sunspot center was chosen as the center of gravity ( cog ) of the @xmath8 image for the entire sunspot .",
    "for noaa ar 10944 , we use the cog of the @xmath8 image for the umbra ( @xmath9 ) only because the images did not cover the entire penumbral area .",
    "we used only the southern part for the sunspot in noaa ar 10933 , because a largest bubble was stably located at the top of the nfi images ( t. d. tarbell et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "the southern part of the sunspot appeared to be clean .",
    "we performed the following calibrations for the stokes profiles observed with the sp : ( 1 ) dark subtraction and flat - fielding , ( 2 ) the polarization calibration induced by the optical elements in the sot , ( 3 ) the correction in the direction of spectral dispersion , ( 4 ) merging of two orthogonal polarizations simultaneously measured with the left and right segments of the ccd , ( 5 ) the correction for spectral curvature , ( 6 ) compensation for residual crosstalk _ i _",

    "after the calibration , vector magnetic fields were derived with a least - squares fitting ( `` stokes inversion '' ) that assumed a milne - eddington representation of the atmospheric stratification ( t. yokoyama et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) . of the 13 parameters obtained with the stokes inversion ,",
    "we consider only the field strength ( @xmath11 ) , the inclination angle relative to the line of sight ( @xmath12 ) , and the filling factor ( @xmath13 ) . the magnetic field maps thus obtained were aligned to the g - band images taken at the time closest to the midpoint of the sp maps , using cross - correlation of the sp continuum intensity map with the bfi g - band images .",
    "one must resolve the 180@xmath14 ambiguity of the azimuth angle in order to calculate the inclination with respect to the normal to the solar surface .",
    "we first select the line - of - sight azimuth closest to the potential field computed using the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field as a boundary condition .",
    "then we interactively determined the azimuth to reduce discontinuities of azimuth and inclination angles by using the azam utility ( written in idl by p. seagraves ; * ? ? ? * ) , which allowed us to display and select the two alternatives for the azimuth angle .",
    "both the sunspots were located near the disk center , so any errors in the inclination arising from the wrong choice of the ambiguous azimuth will amount to less than 15@xmath14 . in any event ,",
    "an erroneous choice of azimuth is rare for symmetric sunspots such as those studied here .",
    "the penumbra consists of many radial structures , and mmfs usually move radially outward from the outer penumbral edge .",
    "figure  [ 20070104_lfov ] displays on the vertical axis the radial distance from the averaged penumbral outer boundary , and on the horizontal axis , the position angle around the sunspot center .",
    "the contours in figure  [ 20070104_lfov ] enclose features brighter in the g band than @xmath15 .",
    "many of the features enclosed by the contours in figure  [ 20070104_lfov]_a _ may be found in the middle and outer penumbra .",
    "some of these correspond to stronger positive line - of - sight fields ( fig .",
    "[ 20070104_lfov]_b _ ) .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ 20070104_lfov]_c _ demonstrates that the enclosed radial structures have magnetic fields that are more vertical than those of their surroundings .",
    "the line - of - sight direction is nearly normal to the solar surface in this case .",
    "therefore , we can assign the white and gray areas in the outer penumbra of figure  [ 20070104_lfov]_b _ as the vertical ( spine ) component and the horizontal ( intra - spine ) component of the penumbral magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "we can also identify the patchy magnetic elements in figure  [ 20070104_lfov]_b _ that have intense white and black areas in the moat region as mmfs with vertical fields .",
    "bright features in the g - band images usually have a radially elongated structure .",
    "@xcite showed , using the finest spatial resolution ( @xmath16 ) ever achieved , that bright penumbral filaments have more vertical magnetic fields than those of dark penumbral filaments in the outer penumbra .",
    "we confirm this relationship using spectropolarimetric measurements with a spatial resolution of @xmath17 .",
    "we find a clear correspondence between mmfs separating from the penumbral spines and convective motions in the outer penumbra .",
    "figure  [ 20070104_sfov ] shows a time series of g - band images and line - of - sight magnetograms around the position angle of 212@xmath14 ( indicated by the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ 20070104_lfov ] ) .",
    "a penumbral spine appears in the frame at 18:46 , as shown by the arrow pointing to the left , and it elongates radially outward . in the same period , a bright elongated structure appears in the g - band image , and its brightest area also moves outward with the elongating penumbral spine .",
    "the elongating spine connects with an existing magnetic element ( indicated by the arrow pointing to the right ) from 19:46 to 20:46 , and the outer part of the elongating spine becomes large in this period .",
    "the outer part of the elongating spine is gradually separating from the main body of the spine , and then this part becomes an mmf in the frame at 23:46 .",
    "we find that granules appear in the outer penumbra when the outer edge of the elongating spine reaches the penumbra outer boundary ( see the 21:46 frame ) .",
    "such granules continuously appear one after another while the mmf is detaching from the spine .",
    "figure  [ 20070104_st_radial ] shows the temporal change of the g - band intensity and the line - of - sight magnetic field along a radial line at the position angle of 212@xmath14 .",
    "two kinds of magnetic elements with outward motion can be seen from the outer penumbra to the inner moat region , as reported in @xcite : fuzzy , small magnetic elements move quickly , and large magnetic elements move slowly .",
    "there is no significant g - band bright feature in the outer and middle penumbra , and only the fuzzy magnetic elements are visible there in the first 2 hr",
    ". then , a bright feature appears around 18:00 on january 4 and moves toward the moat region with an elongating large magnetic element , which corresponds to the elongating penumbral spine shown in figure  [ 20070104_sfov ] .",
    "the bright feature divides into two features around 19:00 : one moves toward the umbra ( the upward arrow in fig .",
    "[ 20070104_st_radial]_a _ ) , and the other moves outward with the elongating spine to become an mmf ( downward arrow ) .",
    "the bright feature moving outward disappears around 20:00 , and another bright feature subsequently appears 20 minutes later at a position similar to where the previous feature disappeared .",
    "this new bright feature also moves outward with the elongating spine .",
    "the outer edge of the spine arrives at the penumbral outer boundary around 22:00 , and as a result of the appearance of granules in the outer penumbra , the penumbral outer boundary retracts toward the umbra relative to its average position .",
    "the bright feature moving with the elongating spine merges with the appearing granules .",
    "the outer part of the elongating spine is completely separated from the penumbra around 00:00 , and this part still moves outward as an mmf .",
    "the elongating speed of the spine averaged over 6 hr after its appearance is about 0.2 km s@xmath18 , which is similar to the horizontal velocities of mmfs that have vertical magnetic fields with the same polarity as that of the sunspot around the penumbral outer boundary @xcite .",
    "there are many bright features moving inward and outward in the penumbra before 00:00 on january 5 , but most of the bright features and the elongating spine disappear from the outer penumbra after the mmf separates from the penumbral spine .    the relationship between the mmf separating from the elongated spine and convection in the outer penumbra is demonstrated above for only the radial line at the position angle of 212@xmath14 . to confirm that this relationship is common all around the penumbral outer boundary , we compare the temporal change in the g - band intensity to the line - of - sight magnetic field at 2@xmath0 inside the penumbral outer boundary for position angles ranging from 180@xmath14 to 360@xmath14 in figure  [ 20070104_st_inside ] .",
    "there are many bright streaks in figure  [ 20070104_st_inside]_a_. these bright streaks represent the granules appearing in the outer penumbra or the penumbral bright features moving outward . on the other hand ,",
    "the positive magnetic features in figure  [ 20070104_st_inside]_b _ mostly correspond to the elongating spines or the mmfs detaching from the spines .",
    "we confirm that the g - band bright streaks are generally located at the elongating spines or at the detaching mmfs , as shown by the contours in figure  [ 20070104_st_inside ] .",
    "this tendency is more clearly seen in the limb - side penumbra ( the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ 20070104_st_inside ] ) than in the center - side penumbra due to the projection effect .",
    "some bright features are not located at positive magnetic features but at negative magnetic features with weak magnetic fields ( darker features than their surroundings ; see the green boxes in fig .",
    "[ 20070104_st_inside ] ) . the bright features in the outer penumbra",
    "are related to formation of the mmfs that have the polarity opposite to that of the sunspot .",
    "the outer boundary of the penumbra fluctuates around its average position , and dark penumbral filaments often elongate into the moat region .",
    "such dark filaments correspond to the areas with strong horizontal fields that extend from the penumbra .",
    "the arrows in figure  [ 20070227_sfov ] indicate the evolution of three dark , elongating penumbral filaments with strong horizontal fields in noaa ar 10944 .",
    "the longer dark penumbral filaments extend to the outer moat region .",
    "the mmfs with the polarity opposite to that of the sunspot are located at the outer edge of the filamentary structure with strong horizontal fields .",
    "this is consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "the dotted circles in the rightmost frames of figures  [ 20070227_sfov]_b _ and [ 20070227_sfov]_c _ indicate that two mmfs with positive polarity and two mmfs with negative polarity are aligned along each of two filamentary structures that have a strong horizontal field ( the middle circles each contain two mmfs that have opposite polarities ) .",
    "this is clear evidence that bipolar mmfs correspond to the intersections of the solar surface with serpentine horizontal fields extending from the penumbra . in this case , each serpentine horizontal field line consists of both @xmath19-loops and u - loops ( see fig .  [ summary_fig]_b _ ) .",
    "this means that whether bipolar mmfs form @xmath19-loops or u - loops depends on which segments of the extended penumbral fields are chosen , as well as on the number of intersections .",
    "the bipolar mmfs with a u - loop may correspond to a localized dip of the magnetic canopy , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ 20070104_st_outside ] shows the temporal change in the g - band intensity and the line - of - sight magnetic field at 1@xmath0 outside the penumbral outer boundary of noaa ar 10933 .",
    "the dark penumbral filaments elongating to the moat region are indicated by the dark features in figure  [ 20070104_st_outside]_a_. the appearance and disappearance of the long positive magnetic features in figure  [ 20070104_st_outside]_b _ are mainly due to the outward motion of mmfs that detach from the penumbral spines .",
    "the elongating dark filaments ( red contours in fig .",
    "[ 20070104_st_outside]_b _ ) are usually located at the areas that have nearly horizontal magnetic fields with respect to the solar surface ( gray or weak white areas in fig .",
    "[ 20070104_st_outside]_b _ ) .",
    "we find that most of the elongating dark filaments are adjacent to the mmfs that have the same polarity as the sunspot .",
    "this means that the dark penumbral filaments elongate near the mmfs that have the same polarity as the sunspot when such mmfs separate from the penumbra .",
    "one example of such a dark penumbral filament and an mmf can be seen at 22:46 in figure  [ 20070104_sfov ] .",
    "the sot allows us to perform continuous observations with high spatial resolution for a duration longer than the typical lifetime of mmfs . the results regarding flux removal from the sunspot in this study are summarized as follows ( see also fig .  [ summary_fig ] ) :    1 .",
    "g - band bright features in the outer penumbra are located at the elongating spines or at the mmfs detaching from the spines .",
    "g - band bright features moving both outward and inward can be found in the middle and outer penumbra .",
    "the penumbral spines elongate toward the moat region in concert with the outward motions of the penumbral bright features .",
    "granules appear in the outer penumbra at locations where mmfs that have the same polarity as the sunspot separate from the penumbral spines .",
    "such granules often merge with bright features moving along the elongating spines .",
    "dark penumbral filaments frequently elongate into the moat region , and longer ones reach the outer moat region .",
    "the elongating dark penumbral filaments coincide with filamentary structures that have strong horizontal fields that extend outward from the penumbra .",
    "we present clear examples of bipolar mmfs indicating a serpentine field with multiple intersections with the solar photosphere .",
    "mmfs with positive and negative polarities are located along the filamentary structures with strong horizontal fields .",
    "the mmfs that are detached from the penumbral spines are usually observed in the neighborhood of the elongating dark penumbral filaments .",
    "the total flux transport rate by the mmfs that are detached from the penumbral spines is greater than the flux - loss rate of the sunspot @xcite .",
    "therefore , items 1 and 2 above confirm that convection in the outer penumbra is related to the flux removal of the sunspot @xcite .",
    "however , the magnetic energy density of the penumbral fields is larger than the kinetic energy density of the penumbral bright features at the photospheric surface . converging and downward flows",
    "are inferred in the subsurface convection zone around a stable sunspot @xcite , and such flows might be essential to the formation and sustenance of sunspots @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the bright features moving outward in the outer penumbra suggests subsurface upwelling and diverging flows . such flows would work against the stabilization of the sunspot , and recent mhd simulations showed that magnetic flux is carried away from the spot by subsurface diverging flows @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that small flux tubes diffuse out into the moat region by small scale convection beneath the sunspot .",
    "the fact that the bright features and granules appear in the outer penumbra at the location of the elongating spines ( that subsequently become mmfs ) supports this idea .",
    "another possibility is that evershed flows detach penumbral flux and advect it into the moat region .",
    "evershed flows with supersonic velocities are often observed around the penumbral outer boundary @xcite .",
    "supersonic flows are also observed in connection with horizontal fields extending from the penumbra @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy density of such supersonic flows is larger than the magnetic energy density of the magnetic fields in the outer penumbra .",
    "nevertheless , the _ hinode _ sp observations of vector magnetic fields with 0.3@xmath0 resolution have confirmed that the evershed flows are radial outward flows along those penumbral filaments that have nearly horizontal fields @xcite .",
    "detachment of the mmfs is observed when the penumbral horizontal fields elongate into the moat region .",
    "this means that evershed flows are related not only to the formation of the bipolar mmfs located along the extending penumbral horizontal fields , but also to the detachment of the mmfs from the penumbral spines .",
    "the evershed flows originate at penumbral bright features that are moving inward in the inner penumbra @xcite , and the detachment of mmfs from the penumbra is observed with penumbral bright features that are moving outward in the outer penumbra .",
    "this suggests the possibility that both evershed flows and the detachment of mmfs originate from the activity of convection below the sunspot penumbra .",
    "the relationship between evershed flows and sunspot decay also should be investigated using doppler and magnetic field measurements of both high spatial and high temporal resolution .",

    "<S> continuous observations of sunspot penumbrae with the solar optical telescope aboard _ hinode _ clearly show that the outer boundary of the penumbra fluctuates around its averaged position . </S>",
    "<S> the penumbral outer boundary moves inward when granules appear in the outer penumbra . </S>",
    "<S> we discover that such granules appear one after another while moving magnetic features ( mmfs ) are separating from the penumbral `` spines '' ( penumbral features that have stronger and more vertical fields than those of their surroundings ) . </S>",
    "<S> these granules that appear in the outer penumbra often merge with bright features inside the penumbra that move with the spines as they elongate toward the moat region . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that convective motions around the penumbral outer boundary are related to the disintegration of magnetic flux in the sunspot . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that dark penumbral filaments frequently elongate into the moat region in the vicinity of mmfs that detach from penumbral spines . </S>",
    "<S> such elongating dark penumbral filaments correspond to nearly horizontal fields extending from the penumbra . </S>",
    "<S> pairs of mmfs with positive and negative polarities are sometimes observed along the elongating dark penumbral filaments . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly supports the notion that such elongating dark penumbral filaments have magnetic fields with a `` sea serpent''-like structure . </S>",
    "<S> evershed flows , which are associated with the penumbral horizontal fields , may be related to the detachment of the mmfs from the penumbral spines , as well as to the formation of the mmfs along the dark penumbral filaments that elongate into the moat region . </S>"
