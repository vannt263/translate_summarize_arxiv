    "the critical exponents of the three  dimensional ( 3d ) ising universality class have been a subject of extensive analytical as well as monte carlo ( mc ) studies during many years .",
    "the results of the standard perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) methods are well known  @xcite .",
    "an alternative analytical approach has been proposed in  @xcite and further analyzed in  @xcite , where this approach is called the gfd ( grouping of feynman diagrams ) theory .",
    "a review of mc work till 2001 is provided in  @xcite .",
    "more recent papers are  @xcite .    in this paper we will focus on the exponent @xmath3 , which describes the leading corrections to scaling .",
    "a particular interest in this subject is caused by recent challenging non - perturbative results reported in  @xcite , showing that @xmath2 holds in the @xmath11 model based on a rigorous proof of certain theorem .",
    "the scalar 3d @xmath11 model belongs to the 3d ising universality class with @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 is expected to be essentially smaller than the values of about @xmath12 predicted by standard perturbative methods and currently available mc estimations .",
    "the results in  @xcite are fully consistent with the predictions of the alternative theoretical approach of  @xcite , from which @xmath13 is expected .",
    "we have performed a monte carlo analysis of the standard 3d ising model , using our data for very large lattice sizes @xmath0 up to @xmath14 , to clarify whether @xmath3 , extracted from such data , can be consistent with the results of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "since our analysis supports this possibility , we have further addressed a related question how a decrease in @xmath3 influences the mc estimation of critical exponents @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we have also tested different finite ",
    "size scaling methods of estimation @xmath3 from smaller lattice sizes to check whether such methods always give @xmath3 consistent with @xmath15 , as one can be expected from the references in  @xcite .",
    "models with the so - called improved hamiltonians are often considered instead of the standard ising model for a better estimation of the critical exponents  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of this approach is to find such hamiltonian parameters , for which the leading correction to scaling vanishes .",
    "however , this correction term has to be large enough and well detectable for the estimation of @xmath3 .",
    "so , this idea is not very useful in our case .",
    "in  @xcite , the @xmath11 model in the thermodynamic limit has been considered , for which the leading singular part of specific heat @xmath16 can be expressed as @xmath17 d { \\bf k } \\right)^{sing } \\ ; , \\label{eq : cvsing}\\ ] ] assuming the power ",

    "this expression is valid for any positive @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the upper cut - off parameter of the model , since the leading singularity is provided by small wave vectors with the magnitude @xmath25 and not by the region @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , @xmath16 is independent of the constant @xmath27 .",
    "the leading singularity of specific heat in the form of @xmath28 and the two  point correlation function in the asymptotic form of @xmath29 , @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "these expressions are consistent with the conventional scaling hypothesis , @xmath34 being the scaling functions .",
    "the exponent @xmath35 is responsible for possible logarithmic correction in specific heat , whereas the usual power ",
    "law singularity is recovered at @xmath36 .    according to the theorem proven in  @xcite",
    ", the two  point correlation function of the @xmath11 model contains a correction with the exponent @xmath37 , if @xmath16 can be calculated from  ( [ eq : cvsing ] ) , applying the considered here scaling forms , if the result is @xmath27independent , and if the condition @xmath38 is satisfied for the critical exponents . applying the known hyperscaling hypothesis @xmath39 , it yields @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "apparently , the listed here conditions of the theorem are satisfied for the scalar 3d @xmath11 model . since the critical singularities are provided by long  wave fluctuations , the condition of @xmath27independence is generally meaningful .",
    "the assumption @xmath18 ( with no logarithmic correction ) and the considered here scaling forms ( with @xmath42 ) , as well as the relation @xmath38 ( or @xmath41 according to the hyperscaling hypothesis ) are correct for the scalar 3d @xmath11 model , according to the current knowledge about the critical phenomena .    the correction with the exponent @xmath43 corresponds to the one with @xmath44 in the finite  size scaling . in such a way",
    ", the discussed here analytical arguments predict the existence of a finite  size correction with the exponent @xmath45 in the scalar 3d @xmath11 model .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , nontrivial corrections tend to be cancelled in the 2d ising model , in such a way that only trivial ones with integer @xmath43 are usually observed .",
    "however , there is no reason to assume such a scenario in the 3d case .",
    "therefore , the existence of corrections with the exponent @xmath45 is expected in the 3d ising model , since it belongs to the same universality class as the 3d @xmath11 model . because this correction is not necessarily the leading one , the prediction is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the upper bond for the leading correction  to  scaling exponent @xmath3 . using the widely accepted estimates @xmath48 and @xmath49  @xcite for the 3d ising model ,",
    "we obtain @xmath50 .",
    "the prediction of the gfd theory  @xcite is @xmath51 , @xmath52 and , therefore , @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we can state that in any case @xmath54 is about @xmath55 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is expected to be @xmath56 according to the gfd theory considered in  @xcite .",
    "we have simulated the 3d ising model on simple cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath58 of the model is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the temperature measured in energy units , @xmath61 is the coupling constant and @xmath62 denotes the pairs of neighboring spins @xmath63 .",
    "the mc simulations have been performed with the wolff single cluster algorithm  @xcite , using its parallel implementation described in  @xcite .",
    "an iterative method , introduced in  @xcite , has been used here to find pseudocritical couplings @xmath64 corresponding to certain value @xmath65 of the ratio @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the magnetization per spin .",

    "the results for the exponents @xmath229 and @xmath230 ( or @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) are consistent with those of  @xcite .",
