    "massive stars are key ingredients in the early phase of galaxy formation . first stras ( i.e. , popoulation iii stars ) are considered to be very massive from theoretical aspects although the formation of low mass stras may not be ruled out . once first massive stars were formed in subgalactic gas clumps within dark matter halos",
    ", they could begin to work as cosmic engines because of thier huge number of ionizing photons .",
    "then , since they could die after a few million years after their birth , they also supply both kinetic energy and heavy elements even into the intergalactic space .",
    "therefore , massive stars also work as mechanical and chemical engines in the universe .",
    "all these issues suggest that the formation and early evolution of galaxies could be controlled by massive stars ; how massive , how many massive stars ( i.e. , more generally , the initial mass function ) , and when did they begin to form ?",
    "it is also worthwhile noting that massive stars in the phase of galaxy formation are considered to be related to the cosmic re - ionization of the universe .    in order to investigate these problems , it is necessary to carry out searches for galaxies at very high redshift .",
    "such high-@xmath3 galaxies have been identified mainly by the following survey methods ; ( 1 ) optical narrow - band surveys for strong ly@xmath4 emitters ( laes ) , and ( 2 ) optical broad - band surveys for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) ( i.e. , the dropout technique ; e.g. , steidel et al . 1999 , 2003 ; ouchi et al .",
    "other methods are summarized in taniguchi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . although both methods need follow - up optical spectroscopy to confirm that photometrically selected objects are real high-@xmath3 galaxies , more than several hundreds of galaxies beyond @xmath3 = 5 have been already found to date thanks to the great observational capability of 8 m class telescope facilities ( e.g. , dey et al . 1998 ; rhodes et al . 2003 ; hu et al .",

    "2008 ) . to probe massive star formation or initial starbursts in early universe , hydrogen ly@xmath4 emission",
    "provides a powerful tool ( partridge and peebles 1967 ; haiman 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , in this review , we discuss the observational nature star - forming galaxies at high redshift found mainly by the optical narrow - band imaging surveys made so far ( section 2 ) .    in section 3 ,",
    "we give a brief summary of near infrared deep surveys for forming galaxies beyond @xmath5 and discuss thier implication .",
    "another intersting issue is to search for evidence for population iii stars in early universe . since theoretical consideration suggests that some galaxies at @xmath6 may be dominated by population iii stars because of low feedback from first - generation supernovae .",
    "therefore , in section 4 , we give a summary of recent trials for searching for such population iii - dominated galaxies .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we discuss future prospects in this research field briefly .",
    "when we use the optical window ( e.g. , 400 nm  1000 nm ) , we are able to search for laes at @xmath7 2.5  7",
    ". if we are interested in laes beyond @xmath8 , surveys should be made at wavelengths longer than 700 nm where oh airglow emission lines are bright .",
    "therefore , we have to use some narrow windows where oh airglow is moderately weak ; e.g. , 815 nm , 920 nm , and so on .",
    "these atomspheric windows allow us to search for laes at @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and so on .",
    "a summary of such lae surveys for @xmath11 is given in table 1 .",
    "we also give a list of the top ten of most distant galaxies found in the optical lae surveys in table 2 ; the most distant lae known to date is iok1 at @xmath12 ( iye et al .",
    "note that candidate galaxies around @xmath13 have been found in the glare ( gemini lyman - alpha at reionization era ) survey ( stanway et al .",

    "such galaxies , if any , could be much fainter than galaxies with @xmath32 because they could be in still in a mass assmbly phase in their evolution",

    "[ 1 ] _ narrow - band imaging surveys _ : the narrow - band imaging technique provides us a larage number of laes at @xmath33 . therefore",

    "the first nir trial was reported by willis & courbin ( 2005 ) .",
    "their project name is `` zen ( z equal nine ) \" .",

    "they also made a similar deep nir narroband imaging survey for laes in three lensing cluster areas ( abell 114 , 1689 , and 1835 ) .",
    "again , they found no lae candidate with @xmath15(ly@xmath4 ) @xmath37 erg s@xmath17 in the survey volume of 1270 @xmath38 mpc@xmath20 .    using the same instrument and the nir narrowband filter used in the zen survey , cuby et al .",
    "( 2007 ) made a survey for laes at @xmath40 in seven fields , covering 31 arcmin@xmath41 in total .",
    "although their survey area is wider than that of zen , they found no lae candidate .    [ 2 ] _ broad - band imaging surveys _ : the broad - band imaging technique is also powerful to detect high-@xmath3 galaxies .",
    "this is the same technique as the lyman break method in the optical .",
    "the deepest nir imaging survey data are provided by the hubble ultra deep field ( bouwens et al .",
    "2005 ; see also bouwens & illingworth 2006 ) .",
    "the survey depth is down to 28.6 in @xmath42(ab ) and 28.5 in @xmath43(ab ) with a 0.6 arcsec aperture .",
    "they found three probable galaxies at @xmath44 with @xmath45 , corresoponding to @xmath46 . unfortunately , all these sources are too faint to be observed in spectroscopy .",
    "the presence of these objects gives a star formation rate density of @xmath47 @xmath18 y@xmath17 mpc@xmath20 , being smaller by one order of magnitude than that at @xmath3 = 5  6 .",
    "when we use ground - based telescopes , the survey depth is around 25 ab magnitude in @xmath35 and @xmath48 at best because of strong airglow emission .",
    "therefore , nir broadband imaging surveys for a blank field from the ground may not work well . or , we need help of gravitational lensing .",
    "richard et al . ( 2008 ) made deep nir imaging survey for two lensing cluster regions ( abell 1835 and ac 114 ) by using vlt / isaac .",
    "their survey depth is 25.5  25.6 in @xmath35(ab ) , 24.7 in @xmath48(ab ) , and 24.3  24.7 in @xmath49(ab ) for the two regions .",
    "they found 8 and 5 probabale candidates at @xmath50 in abell 1835 and ac 114 , respectively .",
    "given the magnification factor from 1.5 to 10 , their star formation rate ranges from a few to 20 @xmath18 y@xmath17 .",
    "[ 3 ] _ blind spectrocsopic surveys along caustic lines _",
    ": this technique is very unique but very powerful in finding intrinsically faint objects at high redshift ; see for optical trials , ellis et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and santos et al .",
    "stark et al . ( 2007 ) made nir spectrocopic surveys for gravitationally - lensed laes around nine interemedaite-@xmath3 clusters of galaxies by using keck / nirspec . since their spectroscopic survey is designed to sweep the caustic lines of the gravitational lensing , the amiplification factor is as high as 10  50 for objects around @xmath51 .",
    "they found 6 probable lae candidates at @xmath3 = 8.7  10.2 . among them , two objects are the most likely candidates from their careful follow - up observations ; abell 68 c1 at @xmath52 and abell 2219 c1 at @xmath53 .",
    "we have introduced five independent deep nir surveys for high-@xmath3 galaxies beyond @xmath31 . generally speaking ,",
    "it is more difficult to find candidates of forming galaxies in nir than in optical .",
    "one reason is that there is no very wide - field nir imager on 8 m class telescopes .",
    "moircs on the subaru telescope has fov = 4 arcmin @xmath36 7 arcmin ( http://www.subarutelescope.org/observing/instruments/moircs/index.html ) and hawk - i on vlt has fov = 7 arcmin @xmath36 7 arcmin ( http://www.eso.org/instruments/hawki/ ) .",
    "although these nir cameras have widest fov on such 8 m class telescopes , their fovs are still much smaller than those of optical cameras ( @xmath54 30 arcmin @xmath36 30 arcmin ) .",
    "note that both the stronger airglow emission and the much severe tolman dimming [ i.e. , the surface brightness dimming as @xmath55 also makes it difficult to detect laes at nir . also , forming galaxies at @xmath56 could be faint intrinsically .",
    "one intersting issue is to address on first stras in our universe : when were they made ?",
    "how massive were they ? how did they affect the nature of intergalactic medium , chemically and dynamically ?",
    "did only first stars contribute to the cosmic re - ionization ?",
    "how were they related to the formation of supermassive black holes ? in order to give firm answers to these questions , it is necessary to probe first stars or forming galaxies at very high redshift .",
    "the major epoch of pop iii star formation may be at @xmath7 10  30 , when dark matter halos with mass of @xmath57 could have grown up to form first stars ( see for a review , loeb & barkana 2001 ) .",
    "shortly after the formation of pop iii stars ( @xmath58 years after ) , first sypernova explosions could occur and then polute the gas inside and outside of dark matter halos .",
    "however , if this feedback process is inefficient , pop iii stars could be born in galaxies even at @xmath59 or so ( e.g. , scannapieco et al .",
    "2003 ; schneider et al . 2006 ; jimenez & haiman 2006 ; tornatore et al . 2007 ; see also , for recent review , norman 2008 ) .",
    "if this is the case , it is possible to probe pop iii dominated forming galaxies in the optical window .",
    "there are two important observational properties of such pop iii dominated galaxies .",
    "one is the large equivalent width ( ew ) of hydrogen ly@xmath4 emission .",
    "the other property is moderately strong he ii @xmath601640 emission .",
    "these properties are attributed to the very high effective temperature ( @xmath61 k ) of pop iii stars ( e.g. , tumlinson & shull 2000 ; tumlinson et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ; bromm et al .",
    "2001 ; oh et al . 2001 ; schaerer 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "interestingly , it has been reported that some high-@xmath3 laes have a large rest - frame equivalent width of ly@xmath4 emission with @xmath62 a few 100    ( e.g. , malhotra & rhoads 2002 ; nagao et al . 2004 , 2005a , 2007 ; shimasaku et al . 2006 ; dijkstra & wyithe 2007 ) .",

    "analyses of spectra of high-@xmath3 galaxies also found no evidence for pop iii - driven he ii emission ; ( 1 ) shapley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) examined the stacked spectrum of @xmath67 1000 lbgs at @xmath2 3 and obtained evidence for he ii emission .",
    "however , the authors suggested that this feaure may be attributed to pop i hot stars such as wr stars ( see also the comment given by max peetini in the discussion ; cf .",
    "jimenez & haiman 2006 ) .",
    "( 2 ) ouchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) examined the stacked spectrum of @xmath67 50 lbgs at @xmath68 and found no he ii emission .",
    "( 3 ) see the comment given by jon eldridge in discussion .",
    "recently , nagao et al . (",
    "2008 ) made a unique survey for ly@xmath4-he ii emitters by using combination of intermediate- and narrow - band filters in the optical window .",
    "they used ( i ) ia598 and nb816 filters for laes at @xmath69 and ( ii ) ia 679 and nb921 for laes at @xmath70 , where the subaru ia filter system consists of 20 filters covering from 4000    to 9500    with a spectroscopi resolution of @xmath71 ( taniguchi 2001 ; see also ajiki et al .",
    "2004 ; yamada et al . 2005 ) .",
    "their survey field is sdf .",
    "although they found 10 dual - line emitters , they are not identified as ly@xmath4/he ii emitters ( i.e. , low-@xmath3 dual - line emitters such as [ o ii]/[o iii ] ones .",
    "thier survey shows that there is no laes with pop iii star formation rate with @xmath72 y@xmath17 and the pop iii star formation rate density is lower than @xmath73 y@xmath17 mpc@xmath20 , being smaller by a few orders of magnitudes than those of laes at similar redshifts .",
    "finally , we give comments on future prospects . as shown in previous sections , optical deep surveys have been finding a large number of forming galaxies at @xmath7 5  7 .",
    "however , nir deep surveys have been facing to the technical limit of the exsiting large telescope facilities including the hubble space telescope .",
    "therefore , we will have to wait for next - generation telescopes in order to improve our knowledge on massive stars at very high redshift ( i.e. , pop iii stars ) and stat formation hitory of in very young galaxies .",
    "we will have two types of new - generation telescopes in neaer future ; one is the james weeb space telescope ( jwst : sonneborn 2008 , see http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/ ) and the other is extreme large telescopes ( elts ) on the ground such as the european - elt ( dodorico 2008 ; see http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/eelt/ ) and the thirty meter telescope ( tmt : http://www.tmt.org/ ) led by caltech and university of california .",
    "extremly high observational capabilities of these telescopes will open the door to pop iii dominated universe . in particular , mid infrared observations with jwst will be able to go to @xmath74 .    yet , we will have to do our best to find much younger , pop iii - dominated galaxies at high redshift up to @xmath74 before next - generation , space and ground - based telescopes will come .",
    "for this effort , we have two nice helpers .",
    "one is the graviational lensing , as demonstrated in section 3 ( e.g. , stark et al .",
    "2007 ; richard et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the other helper is very bright gamma - ray bursts at high redshift . after the gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) ,",
    "very bright optical flashes have been often observed .",
    "the most distant grb event known to date was found at @xmath65 ( kawai et al .",
    "if such grb events will occur at @xmath13 , we will be detect their rest - frame optical flashes in the nir windows ( sse fynbo 2008 ) .",
    "as for the formation and evolution of galaxies , next - generation telescopes will allow us to explore what happened in galaxy formation and in early evolution phase .",
    "then , we will be able to obtain a unified picture for various types of galaxies at high redshift , e.g. , laes , lbgs , eros ( extremely red objects ) , drgs ( distant red galaxies ) , bzks ( galaxies selected from bzk photometry ) , smgs ( submillimeter galaxies ) , and so on .",
    "finally , we will learn how massive stars have been working as cosmic engines for more than 10 billion years ."
