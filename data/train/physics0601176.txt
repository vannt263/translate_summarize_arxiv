    "the study of income distribution has a long history .",
    "more than a century ago , pareto @xcite proposed that income distribution obeys a universal power law , valid for all time and countries .",
    "subsequent studies found that this conjecture applies only to the top 1@xmath03% of the population .",
    "the question of what is the distribution for the majority ( 97@xmath099% ) of population with lower incomes remains open .",
    "gibrat @xcite proposed that income distribution is governed by a multiplicative random process resulting in the log - normal distribution .",
    "however , kalecki @xcite pointed out that such a log - normal distribution is not stationary , because its width keeps increasing with time .",
    "nevertheless , the log - normal function is widely used in literature to fit the lower part of income distribution @xcite .",
    "yakovenko and drgulescu @xcite proposed that the distribution of individual income should follow the exponential law analogous to the boltzmann - gibbs distribution of energy in statistical physics .",
    "they found substantial evidence for this in the statistical data for usa @xcite .",
    "also widely used is the gamma distribution , which differs from the exponential one by a power - law prefactor @xcite .",
    "for a recent collection of papers discussing these distributions , see the book @xcite .",
    "distribution of income @xmath1 is characterized by the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath2 , defined so that the probability to find income in the interval from @xmath1 to @xmath3 is equal to @xmath4 .",
    "the pdfs for the distributions discussed above have the following functional forms : @xmath5    & { } & \\mbox{log - normal,}\\\\    \\frac{(\\beta)^{-(1+\\alpha)}}{\\gamma(1+\\alpha,0)}x^\\alpha    \\exp(-x/\\beta ) & { } & \\mbox{gamma . }",

    "the log - normal and gamma distributions have two parameters each : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "they have maxima ( called modes in mathematical statistics ) at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and their @xmath2 vanish at @xmath7 .",
    "many researchers impose the condition @xmath12 _ a priori _ , `` because people can not live on zero income '' .",
    "however , this assumption must be checked against the real data .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze statistical data on personal income distribution in australia for 19892000 and compare them with the three functions in eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) .",
    "the data were collected by the australian bureau of statistics ( abs ) using surveys of population .",
    "the anonymous data sets give annual incomes of about 14,000 representative individuals , and each individual is assigned a weight .",
    "the weights add up to @xmath13 in the considered period , which is comparable to the current population of australia of about 20 million people .",
    "in the data analysis , we exclude individuals with negative and zero income , whose total weight is about 7% .",
    "these abs data were studied in the previous paper @xcite , but without weights and with the emphasis on the pareto tail at high income . here",
    "we re - analyze the data in the middle and low income range covering about 99% of the population , but excluding the pareto tail .",
    "the number of data points in the pareto tail is relatively small in surveys of population , which complicates accurate analysis of the tail .",
    "in this section , we study the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath14 .",
    "the advantage of cdf is that it can be directly constructed from a data set without making subjective choices .",
    "we sort incomes @xmath15 of @xmath16 individuals in decreasing order , so that @xmath17 corresponds to the highest income , @xmath18 to the second highest , etc .",
    "when the individuals are assigned the weights @xmath19 , the cumulative probability for a given @xmath15 is @xmath20 , i.e.  @xmath21 is equal to the normalized sum of the weights of the individuals with incomes above @xmath1 .",

    "actually , we constructed the gamma fit only for 98% of the population , because the fit for 99% gives @xmath49 , i.e.  the exponential .",

    "thus , it is instructive to consider pdf as well , which we do in the next section .",
    "in order to construct @xmath2 , we divide the income axis into bins of the width @xmath51 , calculate the sum of the weights @xmath19 of the individuals with incomes from @xmath1 to @xmath52 , and plot the obtained histogram .",
    "however , there is subjectiveness in the choice of the width @xmath51 of the bins .",
    "if the bins are too wide , the number of individuals in each bin is big , so the statistics is good , but fine details of the pdf are lost .",
    "if the bins are too narrow , the number of individuals in each bin is small , thus relative fluctuations are big , so the histogram of pdf becomes noisy .",
    "effectively , @xmath2 is a derivative of the empirical @xmath21 .",
    "however , numerical differentiation increases noise and magnifies minor irregularities of @xmath21 , which are not necessarily important when we are interested in the universal features of income distribution . to illustrate these problems , we show pdfs obtained with two different bin widths in fig .

    "[ fig : pdf](b ) shows the pdf for the year 1994 - 95 with a narrow bin width @xmath56 k$ , which corresponds to @xmath57 .",
    "this pdf can not be fitted by any of the three distributions , because it has a very sharp and narrow peak at the low income 7.3  k$ , which is way below the average income of 19.6  k$ for this year .",
    "this peak is present for all years , and its position is reported in the last column of table [ table ] .",
    "the peak is so sharp and narrow that it can not be attributed to the broad maxima of the log - normal or gamma pdfs .",
    "we speculate that this peak occurs at the threshold income of some sort of government policy , such as social welfare , minimal wage , or tax exemption . comparing the empirical pdf with the exponential curve , shown by the solid line",
    ", we infer that the probability density above and below the peak is transferred to the peak , thus creating anomalously high population at the special income .",
    "we also studied how often different income values occur in the data sets .",
    "the most frequently reported incomes for different years are always round numbers , such as 15  k$ , 20  k$ , 25  k$ , etc .",
    "this effect can be seen in the periodically spaced spikes in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf](b ) .",
    "it reflects either the design of the survey questionnaires , or the habit of people for rounding their incomes in reporting .",
    "in addition to the round numbers , we also find the income corresponding to the peak position among the five most frequently reported incomes .",
    "this income , shown in the last column in table [ table ] , is not round and changes from year to year , but sometimes stays the same .",
    "this again suggests that the sharp peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf](b ) is the result of a government - imposed policy and can not be explained by statistical physics arguments .    by definition",
    ", @xmath2 is the slope of @xmath21 with the opposite sign .",
    "[ fig : cdf ] clearly shows that the slope of @xmath21 at @xmath7 is not zero , so @xmath58 . fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf](b ) also shows that the probability density at zero income is not zero .",
    "in fact , @xmath59 is higher than @xmath2 for all other @xmath1 , except in the narrow peak .",
    "the non - vanishing @xmath59 is a strong evidence against the log - normal , gamma , and similar distributions , but is qualitatively consistent with the exponential function .",
    "however , there is also substantial population with zero and negative income , which is not described by any of these theories .",
    "all three functions in eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) are the limiting cases of the generalized beta distribution of the second kind ( gb2 ) , which is also discussed in econometric literature on income distribution @xcite .",
    "gb2 has four fitting parameters , and distributions with even more fitting parameters are considered in literature @xcite .",
    "generally , functions with more parameters are expected fit the data better .",
    "however , we do not think that increasing the number of free parameters gives a better insight into the problem .",
    "we think that a useful description of the data is the one that has the minimal number of parameters , yet reasonably ( but not necessarily perfectly ) agrees with the data . from this point of view , the exponential function has the advantage of having only one parameter @xmath6 over the log - normal , gamma , and other distributions with more parameters .",
    "[ fig : cdf](a ) shows that @xmath60 vs.  @xmath1 is approximately a straight line for about 98% of population , although small systematic deviations do exist .",
    "the log - normal and gamma distributions do not improve the fit significantly , despite having more parameters , and actually mimic the exponential function .",
    "thus we conclude that the exponential function is the best choice .",
    "the analysis of pdf shows that the probability density at zero income is clearly not zero , which contradicts the log - normal and gamma distributions , but is consistent with the exponential one , although the value of @xmath59 is somewhat lower than expected .",
    "the coarse - grained @xmath2 is monotonous and consistent with the exponential distribution .",
    "the high resolution pdf shows a very sharp and narrow peak at low incomes , which , we believe , results from redistribution of probability density near the income threshold of a government policy .",
    "technically , none of the three function in eq.([pdf ] ) can fit the complicated , three - peak pdf shown in fig.[fig : pdf ] .",
    "however , statistical physics approaches are intended to capture only the baseline of the distribution , not its fine features . moreover , the deviation of the actual pdf from the theoretical exponential curve can be taken as a measure of the impact of government policies on income redistribution .    t.  di matteo wishes to thank the australian social science data archive , anu , for providing the abs data and the partial support by arc discovery projects : dp03440044 ( 2003 ) and dp0558183 ( 2005 ) , cost p10 ` physics of risk ' project and m.i.u.r .- f.i.s.r .",
