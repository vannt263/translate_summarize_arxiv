    "the description of mesons as quark - antiquark bound states within the framework of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation with momentum dependent quark mass functions , determined by the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equation , is able to explain successfully many spectroscopic data , such as meson masses @xcite , electromagnetic properties of pseudoscalar mesons and their radial excitations  @xcite ) and other observables  @xcite .",
    "contrarily to purely phenomenological models , like the quark bag model , the presented formalism maintains important features of qcd , such as dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , dynamical quark dressing , requirements of the renormalization group theory etc .",
    ", cf .  ref .",
    "the main ingredients here are the full quark - gluon vertex function and the dressed gluon propagator , which are entirely determined by the running coupling and the bare quark mass parameters . in principle , if one were able to solve the dyson - schwinger equation , the approach would not depend on any additional parameters . however , due to known technical problems , one restricts oneself to calculations of the few first terms of the perturbative series , usually up to the one - loop approximation",
    ". the obtained results , which formally obey all the fundamental requirements of the theory , are then considered as exact ones , however , with effective parameters .",
    "this is known as the rainbow - ladder approximation of the ds equation .",
    "the merit of the approach is that , once the effective parameters are fixed , the whole spectrum of known mesons is supposed to be described on the same footing , including also excited states .",
    "it should be noted that there exists other approaches based on the same physical ideas but not so sophisticated , e.g. employing simpler interactions , such as a separable interaction for the effective coupling @xcite .",
    "such approaches describe also fairly well properties of light mesons , nevertheless , the investigation of heavier mesons and excited states , consisting even of light @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 quarks , requires implementations of more accurate numerical methods to solve the corresponding equations .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the prerequisites to the interaction kernel of the combined dyson - schwinger and bethe - salpeter formalisms to describe the meson mass spectrum including heavier mesons and excited states as well .",
    "particular attention is paid to the charm sector which , together with the baryon spectroscopy , is a major topic in the fair research programme .",
    "two large collaborations at fair @xcite plan precision measurements .",
    "note that it becomes now possible to experimentally investigate not only the mass spectrum of the mentioned mesons , but also different processes of their decay , which are directly connected with fundamental qcd problems ( e.g. , @xmath7 axial anomaly , transition form factors etc . ) and with the challenging problem of changes of meson characteristics at finite temperatures and densities .",
    "the latter is crucial in understanding the di - lepton yields in nucleus - nucleus collisions at , e.g. , hades .",
    "all these circumstances require an adequate theoretical foundation to describe the meson spectrum and the meson covariant wave functions ( i.e. the bs partial amplitudes ) needed in calculations of the relevant feynman diagrams and observables .",
    "due to the momentum dependence of the quark mass functions , the bs equation requires an analytical continuation of the quark propagators in the complex plane of euclidean momenta which can be achieved either by corresponding numerical continuations of the solution obtained along the real axis or by solving directly the ds equation in the complex domain of validity of the equation itself . with increasing meson mass @xmath8",
    "this region enlarges , and already at masses @xmath9 gev , singularities of light - quark propagators fall within the domain the bs equation to be solved . it is found that even so , only the few first poles contribute to the solution . to analyse the analytical properties of the quark propagators we solve the ds equation in the rainbow ladder approximation by making use of the hyperspherical harmonics basis to decompose the propagators and the corresponding potential and solve numerically the resulting ds equations for the coefficients of such a decomposition .",
    "the further analysis of the solution is based on a combined application of rouch s theorem and a graphical representation of the inverse propagators as vortex fields of the corresponding complex functions . since the main goal of our analysis is the use of the quark propagator functions evaluated at such complex momenta for which the are needed in the bs equation , we focus our attention on this region of euclidean space .",

    "to determine the bound - state mass of a quark - antiquark pair one needs to solve the bethe - salpeter equation , which in the ladder approximation ( hereafter referred to as truncated bethe - salpeter ( tbs ) equation ) and in euclidean space reads @xmath13 \\ : , \\label{bse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 being the bs vertex function and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the inverse propagators of two quarks , which interact via gluon exchange encoded in @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the vertex function @xmath18 is a @xmath19 matrix and , therefore , may contain 16 different functions .",
    "the general structure of the vertex functions describing bound states of spinor particles has been investigated in detail , for example , in @xcite . to release from the matrix structure ,",
    "the vertex function @xmath14 is expanded into functions which in turn are determined by angular momentum and parity of the corresponding meson known as the spin - angular harmonics  @xcite : @xmath20 with eq .",
    "( [ spex ] ) it can be shown  @xcite that the integral matrix form of the bs equation ( [ bse ] ) can be reduced to a system of ordinary algebraic equations .",
    "it should be noted that , if one would consider the meson as a bound state of two quarks with constant masses , i.e. if the meson is treated within the bethe - salpeter formalism with effective quark masses , then the scalar part of the product of quark propagators becomes purely real and free of any singularities .",
    "in such a case the quark masses appear as effective parameters , which need to be different for different mesons . in a more realistic case , where mesons are described on a common footing as bound states of dynamically dressed quarks , the corresponding `` masses ''",
    "are represented by rather complicate functions of the momenta , and the product of two propagators in the above tbs equation remains complex , even in euclidean space .",
    "that means prior proceeding in solving the tbs equation , one needs to know the analytical properties of quark propagators in the complex euclidean momentum space .",
    "the coupled equations of the quark propagator @xmath21 , the gluon propagator @xmath22 and the vertex function @xmath23 are often considered as integral formulation being equivalent to full qcd . while there are attempts to solve this coupled set of ds equations by some numerical procedures , for certain purposes some approximations  @xcite are appropriate .",
    "being interested in dealing with mesons as quark - antiquark bound states within utilization of the tbs equation , one has to provide the quark propagator which depends on the gluon propagator and vertex as well , which in turn depend on the quark propagator . leaving a detailed discussion of the variety of approaches in dressing of the gluon propagator and vertex function in ds equations ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein quoted ) we mention only that in solving the ds equation for the quark propagator one usually employs truncations of the exact interactions and replaces the gluon propagator combined with the vertex function by effective interaction kernels .",
    "this leads to the truncated dyson - schwinger ( tds ) equation for the quark propagator . in concrete calculations",
    "the choice of the form of the effective interaction is inspired by results from calculations of feynman diagrams within pqcd maintaining requirements of symmetry and asymptotic behaviour already implemented , cf .",
    "the results of such calculations , even in the simplest case of accounting only for one - loop diagrams with proper regularization and renormalization procedures , are rather cumbersome for further use in numerical calculations , e.g. in the framework of bs or fadeev equations .",
    "consequently , in practice , the wanted exact results are replaced by parametrizations of the vertex and gluon propagator .",
    "often one employs an approximation which corresponds to one - loop calculations of diagrams with the full vertex function @xmath24 , substituted by the free one , @xmath25 ( we suppress the color structure and account cumulatively for the strong coupling later on ) . in euclidean space",
    "the quark propagator obeys then the tds equation @xmath26\\gamma_{\\mu } s(k ) \\gamma_{\\nu}\\ : , \\label{sde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the bare current quark mass . to emphasize the replacement of combined gluon propagator and vertex we use , as in eq .",
    "( [ bse ] ) , the notation @xmath29 $ ] , where an additional power of @xmath30 from the second undressed vertex is included . for a consistent treatment of dressed quarks and their bound states ,",
    "the dressed gluon propagator @xmath31 $ ] must be the same in the tbs , ( [ bse ] ) , and the tds equations , ( [ sde ] ) .",
    "this truncation , known also as the ladder rainbow approximation , has been widely used to study the physics of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , decay constants @xcite and other observables @xcite and has been found to provide a good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the employed vertex - gluon kernel in the rainbow approximation is also known as the maris - tandy ( mt ) model @xcite .",
    "it is chosen here in the form @xcite @xmath32 }      \\right )      \\left ( \\delta_{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac { k_{\\mu } k_{\\nu}}{k^2 } \\right ) \\",
    ", , \\label{phenvf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term originates from the effective infrared ( ir ) part of the interaction determined by soft non - pertubative effects , while the second one ensures the correct ultraviolet ( uv ) asymptotic behaviour of the qcd running constant .",
    "a detailed investigation of the interplay of these two terms has shown  @xcite that the ir part is dominant for light @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 quarks with a decreasing role for heavier quark masses ( @xmath12 and @xmath33 ) for which the uv part may be quite important in forming meson masses @xmath34 gev as bound states . in the present paper we focus on mesons with masses @xmath35 gev which consist of at least one light quark and for which the uv term can be seemingly neglected .",
    "however , in spite of its minor contribution to meson masses , formally the uv term guaranties the correct asymptotic behaviour of the kernel and in principle it must be included even in case of light quarks forming mesons .      in a first step in our investigation",
    "we disregard the uv term and study the analytical properties of the corresponding propagator functions obtained with the ir term solely ( cf .  also refs .",
    "then we reconcile the results with the uv term in the kernel in section  [ uvimpact ] .",
    "as mentioned above , we are interested in the analytical structure of the propagator function @xmath36 inside and in the neighbourhood of the complex momentum region in euclidean space dictated by the tbs equation .",
    "this momentum region is displayed as the dependence of the imaginary part of the quark momentum squared im@xmath10 on its real part re@xmath10 determined by the tbs equation . in terms of the relative momentum @xmath37 of the two quarks residing in a meson",
    "the corresponding dependence is @xmath38 determining in the euclidean complex momentum plane a parabola im@xmath39 with vertex at im@xmath40 at re@xmath41 depending on the meson mass @xmath8 ; the symmetry axis is the re@xmath10 axis , i.e. the parabola extends to re@xmath42 .",
    "two examples are depicted in fig .",
    "[ parabola ] , for @xmath43 gev ( left ) and @xmath44 gev ( right ) .    , where @xmath45 , entering the tbs equation is defined within the colored areas of the corresponding parabolas ( @xmath46 ) . left ( right ) panel : the integration domain for @xmath47 ( @xmath48 gev ) .",
    "the integration domain is restricted to @xmath49 gev / c ; for larger values of @xmath37 all the partial bethe - salpeter amplitudes are already negligible small ( see , e.g. ref .  @xcite ) . for light mesons ( left panel , @xmath50 gev ) there are no singularities in the colored tbs integration domain . in the right panel",
    "we display the first six self - conjugated poles of propagators of light , @xmath5 , @xmath6 quarks ( asterisks ) and the first four poles for the @xmath3 quarks ( open stars ) which enter the solution of the tbs equation .",
    "the pole positions are quoted in table  [ tb3 ] .",
    "axes are in units of @xmath51 . ]",
    "note that regardless of the form of the interaction kernel , the investigation of the analytical structure of the quark propagator is of great importance , if the propagators exhibit singularities within the corresponding parabola , thus hampering the numerical procedure of solving the tbs equation .",
    "on the other side , the knowledge of the nature of singularities and their exact location in the complex plane will allow one to develop effective algorithms adequate for numerical calculations .",
    "for instance , if one determines exactly the domain of analyticity of the propagator functions , one can take advantage of the fact that any analytical function can always be approximated by rational complex functions @xcite ; then , one can parametrize the integrand in the tbs equation by simple functions which allow to carry out some integrations analytically .",
    "such parametrisations have been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite for meson masses @xmath52 gev for which the propagator functions have been found to be analytical .",
    "unfortunately , for larger meson masses the propagator functions exhibit singularities within the domain of tbs integration and , as a consequence , parametrizations by rational functions are not possible .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case , if the propagator functions have only isolated poles with known locations and residues , then calculations can be significantly simplified by splitting the singular functions into two terms , one analytical in the considered region the other one having a simple pole structure , as discussed below .",
    "coming back to the tds equation  ( [ sde ] ) we mention that it is a four dimensional integral equation in matrix form .",
    "simplifications can be achieved by exploiting specific decompositions of the quark propagator .",
    "then one decomposes the kernel over a complete set of basis functions , performs analytically some angular integrations and considers a new system of equations relative to such a partial decomposition . to be specific , we recall that the calculation of the renormalized feynman diagrams leads to a fermion propagator depending on two functions , e.g. the renormalization constant @xmath53 and the self - energy @xmath54 . instead of @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 one can introduce other two quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 or , alternatively , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the latter ones will be often addressed in the present paper to as the propagator functions . in terms of these functions",

    "( it should be noted , however that , since the parametrized functions are of a rather simple shape , the set of obtained parameters @xmath133 and @xmath134 is far from being unique , i.e. one can achieve a similar quality of the fit with many other choices of @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the only restriction is that the `` mass '' parameters @xmath134 must not provide singularities , neither along the real axis , nor in the complex plane inside the parabola , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in essence , eq .  ( [ parx ] ) with parameters in table  [ tb1 ] provide a convenient parametrization of @xmath99 which is easily applicable in the tbs equation for @xmath135 gev .",

[ cols=\"<,^,<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     comparing with table  [ tb2 ] with the ir term solely it is seen that the positions of the poles and the residues of the propagator functions are a bit different . however , since the new solution of the ds equation , @xmath99 , is correlated with its analytical part and pole structure , cf .",
    "( [ main ] ) , this circumstance does not affect the results of solving the bs equation , implying for instance the robustness of the numerical results reported in  @xcite .",
    "we analyse analytical properties of the solution of the truncated dyson - schwinger ( tds ) equation for the quark propagator in the euclidean complex momentum domain which is determined by the truncated bethe - salpeter equation for @xmath138 bound states with light quarks .",
    "it is found that , within the ladder rainbow truncation with only the infrared term in the combined effective vertex - gluon kernel , the solutions @xmath113 , @xmath114 and the propagator functions @xmath99 for @xmath12 quarks are analytical functions in the whole considered domain for @xmath139 gev , while for @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 quarks they are analytical only in the right hemisphere re@xmath82 . at negative re@xmath10 , the functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 are still analytical , however , the propagator functions @xmath99 contain pole singularities .",
    "the exact position of the poles and the corresponding residues of the propagator functions can be found by applying rouch s theorem and computing the cauchy integrals .",
    "prior to that , in order to localize the approximate region with singularities , we analyse the vector fields of the inverse propagators , the vortices of which indicate the positions of null vectors .",
    "the position of the first few poles and the corresponding residues are found with good accuracy relevant to be used in further calculations of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation .",
    "it is also found that , with only the effective infrared term in the parametrization of the combined vertex - gluon kernel , the propagator functions exhibit poles on the real axis , formally violating the confinement .",
    "these singularities can be removed by taking into account an ultraviolet term .",
    "this term is known to have a minor contribution for not too heavy meson masses and , at the same time , to provide additional singularities of logarithmic branch point types in the solution of the tds equation in the complex plane .",
    "these singularities hamper a simple analysis of the pole structure of the solution .",
    "nevertheless , since the ultraviolet term is needed mainly to guarantee the correct asymptotic behaviour along the real axis , we suggest to take it into account only when solving the tds equation for real @xmath10 and then to use such solutions to compute the tds integrals in the complex plane with ir term only .",
    "in such a way one can assure the absence of poles on the real axis and analytical functions determining the quark propagator in the considered complex domain .",
    "the performed analysis is aimed at elaborating adequate numerical algorithms to solve the bs equation in presence of singularities and to investigate the properties of mesons , such as the open charm @xmath67 mesons , related directly to physical programmes envisaged , e.g. at fair .",
    "furthermore , the knowledge of the analytical structure of the quark propagators is important for designing appropriate phenomenological kernels since it is related to such fundamental characteristics of qcd as confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking phenomena encoded in the chiral condensate being the trace of the quark propagator .",
