    "with a few notable exceptions , the interaction between the community of mathematicians who work in special functions , in particular , those that are in the area of @xmath0-series and basic hypergeometric functions and the physics community has so far been minimal . in this review article",
    ", we will describe some developments in one area in physics , namely the theory of random matrix ensembles , where a @xmath0-generalization has been proposed to be relevant for multifractal states near a critical regime .",
    "the term multifractal states refers to the novel fractal characteristics of the quantum mechanical wave functions of a disordered electronic conductor .",
    "it is well known in the physics literature that depending on the strength of the disorder , a quantum conductor may undergo a phase - transition from a metallic state which describes a good conductor to those of an insulating state where the ( static ) conductivity in a finite sample is very small . in a region near the transition",
    "such multifractal wave functions are observed at least in numerical experiments .",
    "in addition to giving an overview of the results obtained so far as well as providing some details that have not been published before , the hope of the authors is to draw the attention of mathematicians to some mathematically posed unsolved problems that are important from the physics point - of - view .",
    "we expect that this will also provide some additional insight into some of the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath0-polynomials that may not be obvious from their conventional definitions .",
    "more precisely , we suspect that there exists certain `` universal scaling limits , '' to be explained later , for at least a class of @xmath0-polynomials in certain asymptotic regime that have not been fully explored by those mathematicians who are interested in @xmath0-special functions .",
    "the work discussed here were done over last several years in many collaborations with carsten blecken , john klauder , vladimir kravtsov and nikos nicopoulos .",
    "originally , random matrix ensembles ( rmes ) were proposed by e. wig - ner in the early sixties to describe the statistical properties of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of complex many - body quantum systems in which the hamiltonians of such systems are only defined in a probabilistic setting @xcite . over the past fifteen years",
    ", they proved to be a useful tool in the studies of equilibrium and transport properties of disordered quantum systems , classically chaotic systems with a few degrees of freedom , two - dimensional gravity , conformal field theory and chiral phase transitions in quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "the reason that such a wide variety of physical systems ( with sizes ranging over more than nine orders of magnitude between a nucleus and a micron size disordered quantum conductor ) can be described by theory of rmes , which has no adjustable parameter in it , is that there exists a special double scaling limit in which the correlations between appropriately scaled eigenvalues in all these systems are universal , independent of any parameter that describes the particular system .    in this section",
    ", we will briefly introduce the standard gaussian rme , without any attempt to show how the expressions are derived .",
    "detailed derivations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to point out the reason for the existence of the zero - parameter universality under certain double scaling in gaussian rme .",
    "we will then introduce the so - called `` coulomb gas '' picture to just point out how the zero parameter universality had been `` proven '' to be valid beyond gaussian rme .",
    "these will also serve the purpose of introducing notations and terminologies . in the following section we will show how this `` proof '' breaks down when the parameter @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) is introduced .",
    "this then points towards to a new one - parameter universality .",
    "we will then review various known results as well as open problems for some of the @xmath0-ensembles . except for the section on circular ensembles",
    ", we will consider only unrestricted hermitian matrices relevant for physical systems with broken time - reversal symmetry ( which for example described a charged system in the presence of a magnetic field ) .",
    "the corresponding ensemble is known as the unitary ensemble .",
    "we would like to point out here that although the gaussian orthogonal and symplectic ensembles are by now very well understood largely due to the work of tracy and widom , the corresponding @xmath0-generalizations have not been studied to date .      consider the set of all @xmath2 hermitian matrices @xmath3 randomly chosen with the following probability measure @xmath4dm,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a constant",
    ", @xmath6 is the matrix trace and @xmath7 the haar measure . by going over to the eigenvalues - eigenvectors representation",
    ", it can be shown that the joint probability distribution of the eigenvalues @xmath8 of the matrices can then be written ( up to @xmath9 , the volume of the unitary group ) in the form @xcite @xmath10 here the factor @xmath11 arises from the jacobian of a change of variable , see @xcite .",
    "the level correlations can be determined exactly by recognizing that the distribution can be written as a product of vandermonde determinants of a set of ( monic ) orthogonal hermite polynomials .",
    "the orthonormal hermite polynomials satisfy the orthogonality relation @xmath12 the main quantity of interest is the two - level kernel @xmath13 from which all correlation functions can be obtained . for example",
    "the @xmath14-level correlation function is given by @xcite @xmath15_{i , j=1,2\\dots n } \\end{split}\\ ] ] for the above gaussian distribution the kernel has the explicit form @xmath16}{(x - y ) } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we have used the christoffel - darboux formula for the last equality .",
    "in particular , the density of levels can be obtained simply as @xmath17 .",
    "the plancherel - rotach asymptotics for the hermite polynomials treat the large @xmath18 behavior if @xmath19 , or @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are fixed and @xmath23 see @xcite . in the large @xmath18 limit , with @xmath24 and @xmath18 as above , the density of levels @xmath25 and zero otherwise .",
    "we will now consider the double scaling limit , given by @xmath26 , @xmath24 , @xmath27 such that the products @xmath28 , @xmath29 remain finite .",
    "this particular @xmath18 dependence of the product is chosen so that the density @xmath30 in the new scaled variable .",
    "we will ignore here rapidly falling density at the edges @xmath31 where it becomes zero and have focused our discussion to the middle of the density , i.e. , @xmath24 near @xmath32 where @xmath33 . in these new scaled variables , i.e. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 and using the known asymptotics of hermite polynomials , the two - level `` limit kernel '' becomes @xmath36}{\\pi(\\zeta-\\eta ) } ; \\;\\;\\ ; \\overline{\\sigma}_g(\\zeta)=\\overline{k}_g(\\zeta,\\zeta)=1.\\ ] ] this kernel , which is universal because it does not depend on @xmath18 , gives rise to the famous wigner - dyson - mehta correlations of the eigenvalues @xcite . note that if we choose the ensemble from a more general gaussian distribution @xmath37,\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 can always be removed by a simple completing of squares .",
    "therefore by an analogous rescaling the universality ( parameter independence ) of the two - level limit kernel is again reproduced .",
    "the details of this treatment are in percy deift s excellent monograph @xcite .",
    "we now choose a non - gaussian distribution of the ensemble defined by @xmath41\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is a suitably increasing function of @xmath24 , so that the multiple integral , @xmath43 exists for any fixed @xmath18 , where the joint probability distribution of the eigenvalues is @xmath44 by going through the same procedure as described above we can write the two - level kernel in terms of a set of polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to the weight function @xmath45 rather than @xmath46 which previously led to the hermite polynomials . however , for an arbitrary @xmath42 , one would not expect the corresponding orthogonal polynomials to have explicit representations , or simple properties , and therefore this is usually not a very useful description .",
    "dyson introduced a coulomb gas picture @xcite by writing @xmath47 and identifying @xmath48 with the hamiltonian of a `` gas '' of @xmath18 classical charges on a line interacting with each other with logarithmic coulomb repulsion and held together by a confining potential @xmath42 , at a `` temperature '' @xmath49 . for our unitary ensembles , @xmath50 . in the large @xmath18 limit",
    ", dyson assumed that a continuum description is valid .",
    "( we will see later that this is where the @xmath0-ensembles differ in a subtle way ) .",
    "this is a plausible approximation if the density of the charges increases with @xmath18 so that the spacing between the charges decreases with @xmath18 , and the @xmath26 limit allows one to use a continuum approximation . in this case , the two - level correlation function ( related to the two - level kernel by eq . )",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath51 the variational derivative can be evaluated in the coulomb gas picture by minimizing the energy ( subject to the positivity of the density ) , which leads to the integral equation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the support of the density @xmath54 in general , the determination of @xmath55 is a highly non - trivial problem and remain unsolved .",
    "the inverse of the equation then shows that the functional derivative of , and therefore all level correlations are independent of the choice of the form of the potential , so that the non - gaussian ensemble has the same universality as the gaussian ensemble provided that the assumption that @xmath55 is a single interval is valid .",
    "this is the reason why many physical systems , which may be described by different constraints and hence different form for the distribution of the ensemble , still follow the universal zero - parameter description of the rme at the double scaling limit .",
    "note that the proof depends only on the existence of the continuum limit where the electrostatic coulomb gas picture holds .",
    "we now reconsider the non - gaussian case from the point - of - view of the orthogonal polynomials . as mentioned before , for any confining potential @xmath42",
    ", we can define the set of polynomials @xmath56",
    "orthogonal with respect to the weight function @xmath57 , @xmath58 such that the christoffel - darboux kernel becomes @xmath59 the point now is that although we do nt know the polynomials for arbitrary @xmath42 , the universality in the coulomb gas picture implies that polynomials orthogonal with respect to _ any _ weight function must have the scaling property in the asymptotic region qualitatively similar to the hermite polynomials , namely @xmath60 such that the double scaling that removes the @xmath18-dependence from the density ( to make it unity in the scaled variable ) also removes the @xmath18-dependence from the two - level kernel .",
    "in other words , the universality of rmes for some confining potentials is related to some `` universal '' asymptotic scaling properties of the orthogonal polynomials .",
    "clearly , various random matrix models can be defined either by choosing a confinement potential , or equivalently a set of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "it is therefore obvious to ask if the @xmath0-polynomials share the same scaling characteristics as the classical polynomials .",
    "historically , physicists working with random matrix ensembles did not know about @xmath0-polynomials , so this question was never asked .",
    "it was a particular weight function arising in the problem of disordered conductors @xcite that eventually led the first and second named authors to seek help from prof .",
    "george andrews who suggested that mourad ismail be brought on board , starting a very fruitful collaboration .    in the next section",
    ", we will consider some specific examples of the @xmath0-ensembles .",
    "here we mention the important general features of @xmath0-polynomials that are relevant for the breakdown of the double scaling universality for the @xmath0-ensembles .    for classical orthogonal polynomials ,",
    "the density @xmath62 scales with some power of @xmath18 ( e.g. , @xmath63 for hermite polynomials ) .",
    "it has two consequences .",
    "first , the spacing between nearest two levels scales as a power of @xmath64 , so that the continuum limit can be achieved by taking the @xmath26 limit .",
    "second , the fact that @xmath65 guarantees that if the moments of the weight function @xmath66 are given then @xmath67 is uniquely determined . for those @xmath0-polynomials that correspond to the indeterminate moments problem ,",
    "the density @xmath68 is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "the fact that in this case @xmath69 is finite implies that the corresponding moment problem is indeterminate@xcite .",
    "clearly we expect the asymptotics of these polynomials to have different scaling properties .",
    "we have observed however that all the cases of @xmath0-orthogonal polynomials when the measure ( weight ) of orthogonality is not unique one can always find a weight function @xmath70 so that @xmath71 has a limit as @xmath72 .",
    "this probably contains a new universality law .",
    "this distinguishes @xmath0-orthogonal polynomials , that is polynomials whose recursion coefficients in the orthonormal form grow exponentially , from other cases of indeterminacy with recursion coefficients growing at a polynomial rate .",
    "it turns out that the weight functions for some @xmath0-polynomials behave as @xmath73 for large @xmath74 for some positive constant @xmath40 .",
    "an indication of this can be seen from the growth of the the recurrence coefficients as in the conjecture formulated at the end of this section .",
    "if the recurrence coefficients of a symmetric set of orthogonal polynomials @xmath75 grow as @xmath76 , for @xmath77 then the @xmath78 , see @xcite for an example . as the moment problem is indeterminate , there are different choices of the weight function possible for the same recurrence relation . however , @xmath79 for large @xmath24 is a characteristic property for all choices .",
    "comparing with the coulomb gas picture , this means that the confinement potential in this case is `` weak , '' comparable to the repulsive interaction @xmath80 , as opposed to a `` strong '' power law confinement in case of classical polynomials which always dominate over the logarithmic repulsion .",
    "note here that in order for the moment problem to be determinate @xmath42 should grow at least as fast as @xmath81 as @xmath24 tends to infinity .",
    "this difference is crucial .",
    "in fact , if we choose a weak confinement potential of the form @xmath82 for which no explicit ( or closed ) form of the orthogonal polynomial is known , the level correlations obtained by numerical methods turn out to be the same as those obtained analytically from exact solutions of the @xmath0-models @xcite . thus the soft confinement , @xmath18-independent spacing of the levels and indeterminate moments",
    "are all related to each other , and are generic characteristics of what we will call the `` @xmath0-random matrix ensembles . ''",
    "we will see later that these ensembles are related to the physics of multifractality near the critical regime of a phase transition where the wave function of a particle in a quantum conductor changes from an extended state to an exponentially localized state when randomness is increased .",
    "the following conjecture is based on observations we made over the years .",
    "let @xmath84 be symmetric orthonormal polynomials satisfying @xmath85 and assume that @xmath86 has a limit as @xmath87 , for some @xmath88 . if @xmath67 is a weight function for the @xmath89 s then @xmath90 as @xmath91 or @xmath92 , but not necessarily for both .",
    "in fact we even believe that the conjecture holds even for discrete measures in the sense that the @xmath93 , the mass at @xmath94 satisfies the asymptotic relation @xmath95 .",
    "there are ample examples to illustrate this behavior , see @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we will define the @xmath0-hermite random matrix model by the @xmath0-hermite polynomials orthogonal with respect to the askey weight function @xmath96 @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 here @xmath99 , and @xmath100 where @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "ismail and masson @xcite referred to the polynomials @xmath103 as the @xmath104-hermite polynomials .",
    "note first of all that the polynomials in are in the variable @xmath105 , which means that the confinement potential has to be compared in the variable @xmath106 . to check the asymptotic behavior of the potential",
    ", we use the jacobi triple product formula @xcite @xmath107 choose @xmath108 , giving @xmath109 note that the right hand side of is a constant multiple of a theta function . also bear in mind that as a function of @xmath24 the weight function should be @xmath110 , and @xmath111 . so applying the jacobi imaginary transformation , we find after going back to the @xmath24 variable , @xmath112 which is @xmath113 . here",
    "@xmath114    from the asymptotic formulas derived by ismail and masson @xcite , the christoffel - darboux kernel is found in the limit @xmath26 to be @xmath115 ^ 2\\ln(1/q)}\\\\ & \\qquad \\times    { \\left ( } -qe^{u+v};-qe^{-u - v};qe^{u - v};-qe^{-u+v};q{\\right ) } _ { \\infty}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] note that the density , in this @xmath26 limit , is @xmath116 we note here that the christoffel - darboux kernel has a limit as @xmath26 for fixed @xmath117 and @xmath118 and therefore the density also has a limit .",
    "compare the above with the ordinary hermite case @xmath119 note that for any @xmath120 , the @xmath26 limit of the kernel exists .",
    "this is a discontinuous change , and does not allow us to study the important question of how the zero - parameter universality breaks down in a physical system .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that the physically appropriate generalization of the density from the @xmath121 case should involve @xmath122 replacing @xmath18 , which is equal to @xmath18 for @xmath123 , but becomes independent of @xmath18 for @xmath124 .",
    "this means that we should explore the asymptotic behavior of @xmath0-polynomials in the double scaling limit where @xmath125 , @xmath26 , but the product @xmath126 remains finite .",
    "although they have been used in certain special cases @xcite , systematic studies of such double scaling limits of @xmath0-polynomials have not been done .",
    "the kind of limits just described ; @xmath0 becoming @xmath18 dependent would require analysis involving varying weight .",
    "this should be of interest to mathematicians who work in the asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the kernel is independent of @xmath18 , but depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the question then becomes , can the @xmath0-dependence be scaled out by changing to variables such that the density becomes unity , thereby restoring the zero - parameter universality ?",
    "the answer was given in @xcite .",
    "here we provide some detailed steps of the calculation ( and supply the @xmath0-dependent constant factors ) .",
    "we first express the infinite products in terms of jacobi theta functions @xmath127 @xcite , @xmath128 the kernel can be expressed as @xmath129 ^ 3\\ln(1/q)q^{1/8}}\\ , \\frac{\\theta_1(i(u - v)/2;\\sqrt{q})}{i\\sinh((u - v)/2)}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 we now use jacobi s imaginary transformations for the theta functions @xcite , @xmath131 where @xmath132 .",
    "the kernel now becomes @xmath133 where @xmath134 ^ 3 } .\\ ] ] defining new variables @xmath135 we finally have the appropriately scaled two - level kernel @xmath136 where @xmath137 apart from the prefactor @xmath138 , this is the limit kernel quoted in @xcite .",
    "note that the kernel remains a function of @xmath139 , so that the distribution is no longer parameter independent .",
    "however , the dependence on the levels as well as @xmath0 are quite complicated , and various limiting cases turn out to be quite interesting . in the rest of the section we will consider some of these limits .",
    "one corollary of the above expressions for the kernel before and after the imaginary jacobi transformations is that we can equate the density @xmath140 before and after the transformations to obtain the relation @xmath141 ^ 3={\\left ( } \\frac{2\\pi}{\\gamma}{\\right ) } ^{3/2}q^{-1/8}p^{1/4}{\\left [ } { \\left ( } p^2;p^2{\\right ) } _ { \\infty}{\\right ] } ^3.\\ ] ] using this , and the product expansion of the jacobi theta function @xmath142 } , \\ ] ] we can now consider some characteristics of the limit kernel .    for @xmath143 , we get @xmath144 } { \\sinh[\\gamma\\epsilon/2 ] } \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}{\\left [ } 1+\\frac{4p^{2n}}{(1-p^{2n})^2}\\sin^2[\\pi\\epsilon]{\\right ] } + { \\rm o}(1)\\ ] ] this expression depends only on the difference @xmath145 .",
    "we will see that the lack of this `` translational invariance '' for the general expression has important consequences . for @xmath146 , i.e. , @xmath147",
    ", the second term in the product can be neglected , and we get the simple hyperbolic kernel @xmath148 } { \\sinh ( \\gamma ( \\zeta-\\eta)/2)}+{\\rm o}(1 ) ; \\;\\;\\ ;   \\gamma/2\\pi^2 \\ll 1.\\ ] ] the above limit kernel for the @xmath0-hermite model for @xmath149 has been shown to be equivalent @xcite to a banded random matrix model that describes multifractal wave functions at the critical regime for a quasi one dimensional disordered quantum conductor with weak multifractality @xcite . comparing the two ,",
    "the parameter @xmath139 can be explicitly identified with the fractal dimensionality at the critical regime @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the universal kernel resulting from the ordinary hermite polynomial describes chaotic systems with extended wave functions , i.e. , those wave functions that extends to the edge of the sample .",
    "thus the @xmath0-deformation is in some way related to the physics of multifractality , although the nature of the relation is not at all clear .",
    "one major problem in understanding the connection is that we do not know how to study the crossover from @xmath120 to @xmath150 . for a fixed @xmath120 ,",
    "the large @xmath18 limit kernel is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "this prevents us from exploring in details how the double scaling fails as one approaches the limit @xmath150 when the @xmath0-hermite polynomials reduce to the ordinary hermite polynomials and the restoration of the zero - parameter universality . as pointed out before ,",
    "an interesting direction is to study the double scaling regime @xmath125 , @xmath26 , keeping @xmath126 finite , and then consider the limit kernel .",
    "properties of @xmath0-polynomials in such special double scaling limits have not been explored yet .",
    "the situation is completely different in the case where @xmath35 is near @xmath151 .",
    "the physical importance of this `` off - diagonal '' correlation was emphasized in @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath152 .",
    "again for @xmath146 , the @xmath153-functions simplify , and we obtain @xmath154 since @xmath155 for large @xmath156 , the kernel have long range oscillations of frequency @xmath157 whose amplitude grows linearly with @xmath158 ( as long as @xmath159 ) . the case for larger @xmath158 should still have the oscillations , although the prefactor will change .",
    "in other words , the kernel exhibits long range correlations in the @xmath152 direction .",
    "another physically interesting limiting case is the kernel in the limit @xmath160 , i.e. , @xmath161 .",
    "the kernel was heuristically shown to be of the form @xcite @xmath162 } , & \\text{if } \\zeta\\eta > 0 ; \\end{cases}\\ ] ] in squares of unit size along the two diagonals @xmath163 and @xmath164 , where @xmath165 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath166 .",
    "for all other values of @xmath156 and @xmath35 , @xmath167 .",
    "this is a surprising result .",
    "it is not clear if this result is valid only for the @xmath0-hermite polynomials , or is it a generic feature of @xmath0-polynomials in the @xmath160 limit . in particular , the asymptotic properties of the @xmath0-polynomials for large @xmath18 in the scaling limit @xmath26 , @xmath161 , keeping the ratio finite would be interesting from physical point - of - view .",
    "since the moment problem associated with the @xmath0-hermite polynomials is indeterminate , it is instructive to consider a different @xmath0-hermite model to check if the above results are sensitive to the particular choice of the weight function .",
    "one such model is to choose @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the weight function onsidered in @xcite @xmath170 this model of @xmath0-rme was first considered in @xcite .",
    "here we provide some details .",
    "note that the asymptotic behavior of the confinement potential in this model is the same as for the askey weight .",
    "equation can be rewritten in the variable @xmath171 @xmath172 to take advantage of the ismail - masson result for the kernel , which becomes @xmath173 in terms of jacobi theta functions , the kernel has the form , after taking the @xmath26 limit , @xmath174 \\theta_1[i\\gamma(\\zeta-\\eta)/2;\\sqrt{q } ] .",

    "note that @xmath178 is not unity , so one needs to rescale the variables again .",
    "however , for @xmath179 , the density is approximately unity , so we can compare this kernel with the one from the askey weight , which is the same in this regime .",
    "moreover , it is also the same for @xmath180 .",
    "heuristic arguments shows that the @xmath160 behavior to be similar for all potentials that have the same large @xmath24 behavior @xcite , so we expect it to be the same as well .",
    "note that in terms of the original variable @xmath24 , the confining potential had an oscillatory component in the askey weight while the density was monotonic ; in @xmath0-hermite weight the potential is monotonic while the density is oscillatory .",
    "thus , the two models are very different .",
    "it is only after the appropriate scaling that the kernel , and therefore the physical properties , show similar behavior .",
    "note on the other hand that the @xmath0-hermite weight is related to the askey weight as @xmath181 since the jacobi theta function is periodic with respect to a shift @xmath182 , the two weights differ only by a periodic factor with respect to the shift @xmath183 for integer @xmath184 .",
    "whether the physical correlations are always equivalent for all choices of the weight function that correspond to the @xmath0-hermite polynomials , is an interesting open question .",
    "we have already seen that the appropriately scaled physical correlations are independent of the choice of the weight function within the @xmath0-hermite random matrix model and appropriate parameter regimes . in order to see if these are generic properties valid for other @xmath0-random matrices , we now consider as an example the @xmath0-laguerre rme , first considered in @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the weight function @xcite , @xmath185 with the orthogonality relation @xmath186 where @xmath187 .",
    "the orthogonality is on @xmath188 , so the boundary at @xmath189 makes the model qualitatively different from the @xmath0-hermite model .",
    "moreover , as shown in @xcite , for small @xmath24 the confining potential is linear in @xmath24 as opposed to quadratic dependence for the @xmath0-hermite potential .",
    "however , the large @xmath24 behavior is again @xmath190 , so the breakdown of the zero - parameter universality should again be similar . in particular , note that the density at @xmath189 can be obtained directly for any @xmath18 , @xmath191 compare this with @xmath192 . as we suggested for the @xmath0-hermite model before ,",
    "studying the double scaling limit of the @xmath0-laguerre polynomials @xmath125 , @xmath26 with the product @xmath126 finite , would allow us to study the crossover regime from the @xmath18-dependent density and the @xmath18-independent @xmath0-model .",
