    "the two - terminal memristive device based crossbar array is a promising candidate for future non - volatile memories attributing to its low - power and small - area overhead , 3d integration , fast switching speed , compatibility with standard cmos technology and simple fabrication process  @xcite .",
    "however , ultra - high density integration of memristive devices in crossbar arrays still faces a number of challenges such as magnitude of sneak - path ( leakage ) currents , relatively high variation of device operation , and poor reproducibility .",
    "the most significant of these challenges that must be overcome to realize large - scale crossbar array memory is that of sneak - path currents , which demands reduction in leakage currents through unselected devices while reading the memory array .    to circumvent sneak - path currents in emerging crossbar memory arrays ,",
    "several approaches have been proposed .",
    "one of those techniques uses two back - to - back bipolar memristive elements shown in fig.[ivcharac ] ( a ) .",
    "this approach resonates with the immense success of cmos technology in which either the pull - up ( composed of p - type transistor ) or the pull - down ( composed of n - type transistor ) network is active at a given time ; such a complimentary configuration greatly limits the short - circuit currents through the operating circuit . for memristive circuits a similar configuration , known as complementary resistive switch ( crs )",
    "is utilized  @xcite , however , this configuration relies on the polarity difference between the two back - to - back connected memristive elements .",
    "therefore , at a given time , only one of the devices is either in the lrs ( low resistance state ) or hrs ( high resistance state ) .",
    "this indicates that the total resistance of this configuration in equilibrium is always at the highest value , hence , limiting sneak - path currents through unselected cells within the crossbar array . despite these features",
    ", this approach is shown to be not very successful given the relatively large footprint and significant hurdles in a successful miniaturization  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a reading operation on a crs is destructive and the multilevel bits offered by a memristive device can no longer be exploited  @xcite .    alternatively , the other two approaches using a selector device to reduce the sneak - path currents are : one - transistor - one - memristive device ( 1t1 m ) , shown in fig .  [ ivcharac ] ( b ) ; and one - diode - one - memristive device ( 1d1 m ) structures  @xcite , shown in fig .  [ ivcharac ] ( c ) . using a transistor as the selecting device at each crosspoint raises the footprint of each cell and consequently its three - dimensional stacking capability .",
    "therefore the 1t1 m structure is unlikely to realize the potential scalability of memristive devices . in terms of the 1d1 m structure ,",
    "it suffers programming difficulty due to the significant voltage drop across the reverse - biased diode instead of the memristive device .",
    "although a plausible solution is to use a special diode showing typical i - v ( current - voltage ) characteristic in fig .",
    "[ ivcharac ] ( c ) to permit enough current density to write the serially connected memristive device by applying a higher voltage than threshold voltage , enabling the two terminal selector to show exponential current behavior  @xcite .",
    "however , the read operation performance does not always benefit from the nonlinear i - v characteristic , because of the voltage divider effect caused by the external selector  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the higher nonlinearity can diminish read operation performance if the nonlinearity is higher than an optimal value as will be discussed in section  [ compare1s1r ] .",
    "the other option is to engineer a large i - v nonlinearity as shown in fig .",

    "see fig .",

    "however , to realize a large off / on resistance window in this case , this kind of memristive device suffers from life - cycle limitations  @xcite .        the memristive device with intrinsic rectifying behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ ivcharac ] ( f ) has been empirically demonstrated  @xcite , and a rectification ratio in the order of @xmath0 has been achieved in @xcite without significant reduction in either switching speed or retention time , which illustrated its possible application as a solution to circumvent sneak - path currents . however , to the best of our knowledge , a detailed read operation performance evaluations of large - scale crossbar arrays based on memristive devices with intrinsic rectifying behavior has not been investigated in the literature . therefore , our motivation in this paper is to systematically study the read operation performance of crossbar arrays using the memristive device with intrinsic rectifying behavior .",
    "in particular , we : ( i ) provide a verilog - a behavioral model of a memristive device with intrinsic rectifying behavior based on published fabricated device parameters ; ( ii ) evaluate read operation performance of large - scale arrays while considering different interconnect resistance values , hrs / lrs values , rectification ratios and different read - schemes utilizing our proposed model ; ( iii ) demonstrate the effectiveness of this special type of memristive device as an approach to reduce sneak path effects in a crossbar structure ; ( iv ) demonstrate the advantages of the memristive device with intrinsic - rectifying behavior by comparing with a linear memristive device ( without rectification capability ) and 1s1r structure , shown in fig .",
    "[ ivcharac ] ( e ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section   [ crossbarandmodel ] , we describe read margin and read - schemes for a crossbar array .",
    "the memristive device behavioral model along with verilog - a code are provided ; in section [ resultsandanalysis ] we evaluate our memristive device model within a passive crossbar array and analyze the read operation performance of crossbar arrays , specifically in terms of read margin and power consumption ; read operation comparison with other memristive devices and discussions are presented in section [ comparison ] ; followed by conclusions in section [ conclu ] .",
    "a crossbar array is comprised of two layers of parallel electrodes that are crossed perpendicularly , which act as word - lines or bit - lines . at each crosspoint , an element is formed , which can be programmed to the lrs or hrs to represent either a logic ` 1 ' or ` 0 ' when proper voltages are applied to word - lines and bit - lines .",
    "unfortunately , as stated in section  [ introduction ] , this promising memory architecture severely suffers from sneak - path currents , hence the need for appropriate approaches to suppress them . because the sneak - path currents aggravate read / write operation performance of crossbar array and hence , limit the maximum size of a crossbar .",
    "the source of sneak - path current is shown in fig .",
    "[ crossbar ] .",
    "as discussed earlier , one possible approach to suppress sneak - path currents and hence improve read / write operation performance is through using a memristive device with intrinsic rectifying behavior .    to simplify the read operation with large crossbars , in the following simulations a single sense resistor",
    "is used to sense the state of the memristive device instead of using sense amplifier . to obtain the best read margin ,",

    "the voltage bias requirements for these read - schemes are shown in fig .",
    "[ crossbar ] .    due to",
    "the influence from sneak - path currents and total interconnect resistance , the output voltage swing is dependent on the stored data and the position of the cell to be read within the array .",
    "additionally , taking the interconnect resistance into account , the read margin will deteriorate further if the target - cell is located in the furthest corner from the word / bit - line voltage sources  in case of fig .",
