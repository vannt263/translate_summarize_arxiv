    "we found that both the iron line and the crsf were present throughout the active phase of swiftj1626.6@xmath05156 , as the features are detected in each of the data sections ds1ds3 as well as in the long observations .",

    "one example is the recent work on by @xcite .",
    "these authors see what may be an absorption - like feature at 10kev , but the count rate is too low to claim a significant detection .",
    "one must thus take good care to ensure that the feature we see is truly a cyclotron line and not due to calibration uncertainties , additional emission ( e.g. , from the galactic ridge ) , or incorrect modeling of the continuum .",

    "independently of the response function or spectral model the j1626/crab ratio therefore supports that the absorption - like feature does not result from a calibration error .",
    "we also investigated the possibility that cyclotron features in the spectrum arise from the galactic ridge emission by analyzing data from when the source was quiescent .",
    "while swiftj1626.6@xmath02126 remained fairly bright and highly variable for about 1000days after the initial outburst , it then quickly faded to quiescence ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) and stayed reliably low for the last two years of the _ rxte _ mission . during this time",
    "the source continued to be monitored regularly by the pca .",
    "we combined these late observations to obtain a spectrum with a total of 42ks exposure , and compared this with our outburst observations , in order to put limits on the contribution of the flux during the outburst observations from the underlying galactic ridge emission . in the 10kev region surrounding the fundamental cyclotron line",

    "we chose to use ` gabs ` in our analysis because its parametrization provides an easier to interpret and compare characteristic energy parameter ( in contrast to ` gabs ` the energy parameter of ` cyclabs ` does not directly reflect the energy where the absorption - like feature in the spectrum is deepest ) .",
    "many accreting pulsar spectra are either not adequately or at least not uniquely described by the standard empirical continuum models above , especially in the 1020kev range @xcite .",

    "@xcite noted the likely presence of a two step change of the spectral slope for ( as well as a potential cyclotron line residual near 36kev ) , the first change occurring at 1020kev and the other one at higher energies , however , they were able to model this behavior taking advantage of the discontinuity and the two characteristic energies of the ` highecut ` model mentioned above .",
    "other authors used an additional polynomial component in order to describe a more complex rollover shape , i.e. , @xcite for ( an established cyclotron line source ) and @xcite for ( noting a potential cyclotron line residual near 63kev ) . the correct continuum and therefore the presence of a 25kev crsf in ( in addition to the established @xmath455kev one )",

    "the remaining residual near @xmath35kev is most likely caused by an instrumental effect (  [ sec : iodine ] ) .",

    "it is thus likely the first harmonic of the fundamental crsf , which is significantly detected in only a few profile phase bins ( see  [ sec : phaseresolved ] ) .      even after fitting the harmonic feature there remained an even more obvious line - like residual near 36kev ( figures  [ fig2]d and [ fig5]b ) .",

    "the falling edge seems to be steeper than the rising edge , which may be an artifact from the period folding .",

    "the fundamental energy varies by about 1030% over the pulse .",

    "<S> swiftj1626.6@xmath05156 is a be / x - ray binary that was in outburst from december 2005 until november 2008 . </S>",
    "<S> we have examined _ rxte_/pca and hexte spectra of three long observations of this source taken early in its outburst , when the pca 220kev count rate was @xmath170counts@xmath2 , as well as several combined observations from different stages of the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are best fit with an absorbed cutoff power law with a @xmath3kev iron emission line and a gaussian optical depth absorption line at @xmath410kev . </S>",
    "<S> we present strong evidence that this absorption - like feature is a cyclotron resonance scattering feature , making swiftj1626.6@xmath05156 a new candidate cyclotron line source . </S>",
    "<S> the redshifted energy of @xmath410kev implies a magnetic field strength of @xmath5 g in the region of the accretion column close to the magnetic poles where the cyclotron line is produced . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of phase averaged spectra spanning the duration of the outburst suggests a possible positive correlation between the fundamental cyclotron energy and source luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> phase resolved spectroscopy from a long observation reveals a variable cyclotron line energy , with phase dependence similar to a variety of other pulsars , as well as the first harmonic of the fundamental cyclotron line . </S>"
