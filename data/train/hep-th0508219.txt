    "gauge theories were led to a major position in the foundations of physics as the main tool to describe the standard model of elementary particles . a great variety of work in this area has been done , and important achievements have been reached by the study of non - abelian symmetry groups such as @xmath0 or @xmath1",
    ". however , deeper analyses are still necessary , specially in non - perturbative cases , in order to understand subtle aspects and to discover new properties of these theories .",
    "hence , an important tool to describe these systems is the semiclassical limit , with which it is possible to obtain valuable insights about their quantum behaviour . and , in this context , an approach that is largely used is to analyze the orbits of a single particle , which is the main objective of this article .",
    "we start proposing an expression for the quadriforce that describes the interaction between a particle with isospin and fields from gauge theories , which usually have scalar and vector components .",
    "although such expression is well established in the case of vector fields ( the so called wong s expressions @xcite ) , it is still a matter of investigation for scalar fields ( @xcite , @xcite ) . to obtain an expression that takes into account both contributions ,",
    "we make use of wong s equation combined with a gauge generalization of the quadriforce presented in our previous work @xcite , which referred to scalar fields only .    with this formalism",
    ", we apply the resultant equations to two cases of physical significance : a coloured particle interacting with a bps monopole , which behaves asymptotically as a magnetic monopole , and with a julia - zee dyon , which behaves asymptotically as a magnetic plus electric monopole .",
    "we observe that such systems present no dynamical equilibrium points and have no apparent general analytical solutions .",
    "hence , we particularize to simpler cases in which the general properties of the motion of the particle can be well established : radial and asymptotic motions .",
    "as far as the radial motion is concerned , we find that there are no bounded orbits for the particle : it always escapes in a direction that is related to the sign of the radial component of its isospin . analyzing the asymptotic motion , in the limits of low ( newtonian ) and high ( ultra - relativistic ) velocities",
    ", we observe the existence of bounded orbits under certain conditions . the remarkable property , however , is that all of the asymptotic trajectories are constrained to a conical surface in both limits . and this is exactly the case of classical electromagnetism , in which the motion of a point charge interacting with a magnetic monopole is restricted to the surface of a cone .",
    "this article is divided as follows : in section [ sec : bps ] we derive the equations of motion for the particle in the presence of the bps monopole and analyze it globally ; in section [ sec : radial ] , we specify them to radial motion and , in section [ sec : asympt ] , to asymptotic motion .",
    "the case in which the monopole involved is the julia - zee dyon is presented in section [ sec : dyon ] and conclusions are described in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "firstly , we derive the general equations that describe the interaction of a particle with isospin and gauge fields",
    ". two sets of equations are requested : the one referring to the quadriforce and the one to the isospin s precession .",
    "as we have previously explained , we propose an expression for the quadriforce that is a combination of wong s equation and a generalization of the equation proposed in our last article .",
    "this was originally conceived to take into account scalar fields only :    @xmath2    in the above expression , @xmath3 are the coordinates of the particle , @xmath4 is its proper time , @xmath5 are the components of its isospin , @xmath6 is the coupling constant , @xmath7 is the minkowskian metric and @xmath8 are the scalar fields .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize ( [ original ] ) to gauge fields : we only have to replace the ordinary derivatives by covariant ones :    @xmath9    to include the self - interaction of the gauge fields as well , it is necessary to introduce wong s expression , which leads us to :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the components of the strength tensor of the fields .    the isospin s precession equation is obtained just in the same way : we make use of the expression proposed in our last work generalized to gauge fields ( which recovers wong s expression in the case of vector fields only ) :    @xmath12    therefore , equations ( [ quadriforce ] ) and ( [ isospin ] ) are the equations of motion of a coloured particle interacting with gauge fields .",
    "the bps monopole is described by the fields ( @xcite , @xcite ) :    @xmath13    where :    @xmath14    and @xmath15 is a constant .",
    "hence , by applying them to the equations ( [ quadriforce ] ) and ( [ isospin ] ) , we get the following system :    @xmath16 + \\frac{hk}{r^2 } \\left ( \\vec{i } \\times \\vec{v } \\right ) + \\frac{rh'-h ( 1+k)}{r^2 } \\left ( \\vec{r } \\cdot \\vec{v } \\right )   \\left ( \\vec{i } \\times \\vec{r } \\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can write it as a dynamical system and look for equilibrium points to study its stability . imposing the equilibrium condition and using a base of co - moving coordinates ,    @xmath17    it is straightforward to conclude that there are no equilibrium points .",
    "therefore , we particularize ( [ system ] ) to more restricted conditions and study the general properties of the resultant orbits .",
    "if the particle is initially moving in the radial direction , @xmath18 , and its isospin is also in the same direction , @xmath19 , we can use equations ( [ system ] ) to show that the particle will remain in the radial direction according to :    @xmath20    where the function @xmath21 is defined as :    @xmath22\\ ] ]    to study this unidimensional motion , we can firstly analyze it in the newtonian limit , @xmath23 .",
    "it is clear that , in this case , the function @xmath21 is nothing but the potential energy of the particle due to its interaction with the monopole ; moreover , this function has the following properties :    @xmath24    such characteristics of the potential energy can also be seen in figure 1 , in which the graphic of the function is shown for the case @xmath25 .",
    "hence , we conclude that there are no bounded orbits in this limit , and the particle will always escape . of course , in order for the particle not to leave the region of validity of the newtonian limit , it is necessary to guarantee that the constants involved satisfy the condition @xmath26 .",
    "now , we can analyze equations ( [ radial ] ) in the relativistic case .",
    "although an analytical solution is not available , we can infer the main properties of the resultant motion by seeking a constant of motion .",
    "taking @xmath27 , the total relativistic kinetic energy of the body , we obtain from ( [ radial ] ) the following constant of motion :    @xmath28    this can be interpreted as the total relativistic energy of the particle , since that , in the newtonian limit , the first term reduces to the well known expression of the classical kinetic energy . analyzing this constant ,",
    "it is clear that there is no more than one return point ( i.e. , points in which @xmath29 ) in the system , implying that no bounded orbits are allowed , and again the particle always escapes .",
    "the equation describing such motion is given implicitly by :    @xmath30    where :    @xmath31      an interesting feature of equations ( [ system ] ) is their behaviour when @xmath32 , since , in this limit , the bps solution behaves as a magnetic monopole . applying this condition ,",
    "we are led to the new system :    @xmath33    in which , again , @xmath34 is the radial component of the particle s isospin .",
    "these equations can indeed be simplified by changing the coordinate system to that of ( [ base ] ) ; hence , writing the isospin vector as :    @xmath35    we obtain that the second equation of ( [ asympt ] ) has the following solution :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 . thus , the motion of the particle in the external ( minkowskian ) space is not coupled to the motion in the internal ( isospin ) space , where its isospin precessionates according to the previous expressions .",
    "so , we have to solve the first equation of ( [ asympt ] ) to completely describe the particle s movement .",
    "however , we seem to have neither an analytical solution nor enough constants of motion for the equation . hence",
    ", we make further approximations and study the system in two very distinct limits : the newtonian limit ( @xmath38 ) and the ultra - relativistic limit ( @xmath39 ) .    in the newtonian limit",
    ", the equation is reduced to :    @xmath40    we observe that ( [ assintnewton ] ) is very similar to the lorentz equation of electromagnetism corresponding to a particle with charge @xmath34 interacting with an electric field generated by a unit charge and a magnetic field generated by a unit magnetic monopole .",
    "the first term is due to the scalar fields and , the second , due to the vector fields .",
    "equation ( [ assintnewton ] ) has three constants of motion that can be directly obtained :    @xmath41    it is clear that the first one is the total energy of the particle , the second is its total angular momentum ( see , for instance @xcite ) and the third , the module of its orbital angular momentum . to determine the equations of motion , we choose spherical coordinates and make the @xmath42 axis coincide with @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward that the particle is restricted to move on the surface of a cone whose axis is in the same direction of @xmath43 and whose half - angle of opening is given by :    @xmath44    in addition , combining the two other remaining constants , we obtain :    @xmath45    it is now possible to analyze the motion in the radial direction by this single constant .",
    "the shape of the effective potential is shown in figure 2 , considering the two possible signs of @xmath34 .",
    "we can conclude that , if @xmath46 , the particle s energy has to be positive and there is only one return point in :    @xmath47    it is important to notice that this `` return point '' is actually a point in which @xmath48 vanishes , and not the velocity @xmath49 . therefore , the particle will also escape .",
    "moreover , it is necessary that @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the return point to be in the asymptotic region and for the particle to remain in the newtonian limit , respectively .    however , in the case in which @xmath52 , the particle is allowed to have positive or negative energy .",
    "if it is positive , there is again only one return point given by :    @xmath53    meaning that there are no bounded orbits .",
    "but if the energy takes negative values , there are two return points , given by :    @xmath54    which means that the movement is bounded . in addition",
    ", there is one equilibrium point , in which the particle just precessionates along the intersection between the cone and the sphere of radius given by :    @xmath55    of course , some conditions regarding all these constants have to be satisfied in order to guarantee that these return and equilibrium points are in the asymptotic region and that the particle remains with low velocities .",
    "these are : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the analytical expression of the radial coordinate , @xmath60 , can be obtained directly by solving the differential equation ( [ vefetivo ] ) .",
    "we note that , if @xmath61 , the solution is :    @xmath62   ^{r(t)}_{r_0}= \\pm t   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while , for @xmath63 , it is given by :    @xmath64 ^{r(t)}_{r_0}= \\pm t\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the sign in the equations has to be chosen according to the initial radial velocity of the particle and changes every time it crosses one of the return points presented .",
    "to complete the description of the movement , we have to determine the expression for the azimuthal angle , @xmath65 .",
    "writing the total velocity in spherical coordinates , @xmath66 , and using the constants of motion , we arrive at the implicit equation :    @xmath67    in the case where the particle precessionates along the intersection between the cone and the sphere of radius ( [ pontoequil ] ) , this last equation can be explicitly solved , and the result is given by :    @xmath68    now that we have analyzed the motion in the newtonian limit , we can move to the opposite limit , the ultra - relativistic motion . in this case , the equation of motion is reduced to :    @xmath69    it is clear that the velocity of the particle is a constant of motion , implying that once the body is in the ultra - relativistic limit , it will remain there .",
    "moreover , two other constants can be readily obtained :    @xmath70    they are , respectively , the total relativistic angular momentum and the module of the orbital relativistic angular momentum .",
    "hence , the orbits of the particle are again confined to a conical surface whose axis coincides with @xmath71 and whose half - angle of opening is :    @xmath72    by using the fact that the module of the orbital angular momentum and the velocity are constants , it is possible to get a differential equation for @xmath60 whose solution is given explicitly by :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the initial angle between the velocity and the position of the particle and the sign of the equation has to be chosen according to the initial sign of the radial velocity of the particle .",
    "we can see that , even if the particle is initially going in the direction of the origin , it will never reach this point , but will stop at @xmath75 and return , escaping to infinity .",
    "therefore , in this limit of high velocities , there is no bounded motion .    to complete the description of the particle s movement ,",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the azimuthal coordinate explicitly by using the constants of motion and the equation for @xmath60 :    @xmath76\\ ] ]",
    "now , we can apply the equations describing the interaction between a coloured particle and gauge fields , ( [ quadriforce ] ) and ( [ isospin ] ) , to the case in which the fields are those from the julia - zee dyon solution , that are given by @xcite :    @xmath77    in which the new functions are :    @xmath78    and @xmath79 is a constant .",
    "we can see that this solution has plenty of similarities with the bps monopole .",
    "the main difference is that the dyon vector field has a non - vanishing time component , due to the existence of the non - vanishing constant @xmath79 .",
    "it is this component that asymptotically generates an electric field that is absent in the bps monopole solution , inviting us to interpret the dyon as an entity with magnetic plus electric charge . replacing equations ( [ dyon ] ) and ( [ dyon2 ] ) in ( [ quadriforce ] ) and ( [ isospin ] )",
    ", we reach the following equations of motion for the system :    @xmath80 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{rh ' - h(1+k)}{\\gamma^2 r^4 } \\left ( \\vec{i } \\cdot \\vec{r } \\right ) \\cdot   \\left [ \\left ( \\cosh{\\lambda } + \\gamma \\sinh{\\lambda } \\right ) \\vec{r } - \\gamma \\sinh{\\lambda } \\left ( \\vec{r } \\cdot \\vec{v } \\right ) \\vec{v } \\right ] +   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{k^2 - rk'-1}{\\gamma r^4 } \\left ( \\vec{i } \\cdot \\vec{r } \\right ) \\left ( \\vec{v } \\times \\vec{r } \\right ) +   \\frac{k'}{\\gamma r } \\left ( \\vec{v } \\times \\vec{i } \\right ) \\label{movdyon } \\\\",
    "\\dot{\\vec{i } } & = & \\frac{1-k}{r^2 } \\left [ \\vec{i } \\times \\left ( \\vec{v } \\times \\vec{r } \\right ) \\right ] + \\frac{hk\\cosh{\\lambda}}{r^2 } \\left ( \\vec{i } \\times \\vec{v } \\right ) + \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\left[rh'-h ( 1 + k - \\tanh{\\lambda})\\right ] } { r^2 } \\cdot \\cosh{\\lambda } \\left ( \\vec{r } \\cdot \\vec{v }   \\right ) \\left ( \\vec{i } \\times \\vec{r }",
    "\\right )   \\label{movdyon2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which bears some resemblance with the equations of motion when the interacting field is the bps monopole .",
    "it is straightforward to note that there are no equilibrium points for this system either .",
    "thus , as an analytical solution does not seem available , we study special cases for this system , as we have done for the case of the bps monopole .",
    "first , one can note that the particle can develop radial motion if its initial isospin and its initial velocity point both to the radial direction ; the equations of motion resultant from these conditions are :    @xmath81    where @xmath21 is still the function ( [ potencial ] ) .",
    "we can also see that , in the newtonian limit , the equations of motion are the same as the ones referring to the bps monopole , as long as we replace the constant @xmath34 by an `` effective constant '' @xmath82 that takes into account the electric charge carried by the dyon . hence , the qualitative description of the motion is the same : no bounded orbits are allowed and the particle escapes to infinity .    in the relativistic case , we can study the expressions in ( [ radial_dyon ] ) by searching for constants of motion . as in the bps monopole case , a constant that can be interpreted as the total relativistic energy of the particle",
    "can be found and is given by :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 , again . when we analyze the conditions in which return points occur , it is possible to conclude that , as in the bps monopole case , there is at most one return point .",
    "this means that no bounded orbits are allowed even in the relativistic case .",
    "therefore , the global behaviour of the radial orbits of systems ( [ radial ] ) and ( [ radial_dyon ] ) are very similar .",
    "another special case of equations ( [ movdyon ] ) and ( [ movdyon2 ] ) is the asymptotic limit . making @xmath32 ,",
    "we are led to the following expressions :    @xmath85 + + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma r^3 }   \\left ( \\vec{r } \\times \\vec{v } \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ \\alpha ( t ) & = & \\alpha ( 0 ) \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\beta(t ) & = & \\beta(0 ) \\cos{\\left ( \\delta r(t ) \\mbox{e}^{-\\lambda } \\right ) } + \\rho(0 ) \\sin{\\left ( \\delta r(t ) \\mbox{e}^{-\\lambda } \\right ) } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\rho(t ) & = & \\rho(0 ) \\cos{\\left ( \\delta r(t ) \\mbox{e}^{-\\lambda } \\right ) } - \\beta(0 ) \\sin{\\left ( \\delta r(t ) \\mbox{e}^{-\\lambda } \\right)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath35    once more , as in the case of the bps monopole , the motion in the external space is not coupled to the motion in the internal space , where the isospin precessionates .",
    "the only difference is in the frequency of the oscillations of the isospin vector , changed by the factor @xmath86 due to the dyon s electric charge .",
    "now , we analyze the equation of motion in the external space in the newtonian limit , in which they are reduced to :    @xmath87    this expression has the same similarity to the lorentz equation in eletromagnetism as described for equation ( [ assintnewton ] ) .",
    "the difference now is the presence of the factor @xmath88 in the term referring to the electric field , due to the contribution of the dyon s electric charge .",
    "this means that the particle is now interacting with an electric charge @xmath88 , and not with an unit one , as it was the case for the bps monopole .",
    "three constants of motion can be found again , and are given by :    @xmath89    implying that the trajectories of the particle are confined to the same conical surface of the case of the bps monopole .",
    "the expressions for the coordinates @xmath60 and @xmath65 are the same as expressions ( [ sol : edonewton ] ) , ( [ sol : edonewton2 ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) as long as one replaces the constant @xmath34 by the `` effective constant '' @xmath90 .",
    "the conclusions are , once again , the same as in section [ sec : asympt ] and bounded orbits occur only if @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "now , we study the first equation of ( [ assintdyon ] ) in the ultra - relativistic limit .",
    "the expression obtained is :    @xmath93 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma r^3 } \\left ( \\vec{r } \\times \\vec{v } \\right)\\ ] ]    one constant of motion that can be found is the total energy of the particle :    @xmath94    however , as we are considering the asymptotic ( @xmath32 ) and ultra - relativistic ( @xmath95 ) limits , the first term of the previous expression is very large compared to the second , and so we can take it as constant . therefore , in such case , the velocity of the particle is a constant of the motion , as in the situation of the bps monopole .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the total relativistic angular momentum and the module of the orbital relativistic angular momentum are also constants of motion , implying that the equations for @xmath60 and @xmath96 are the same as ( [ r_rel ] ) and ( [ phi_rel ] ) .",
    "hence , the conclusions are the same as the ones in section [ sec : asympt ] : the orbits are unbounded and restricted to the conical surface whose axis is @xmath43 and whose half - opening angle is given by ( [ conerel ] ) .",
    "it is possible to see that there is plenty of similarities between the two systems considered , i.e. , a particle with isospin interacting with a bps monopole and with a julia - zee dyon .",
    "both systems present no global equilibrium points and allow the existence of radial motion consisting of unidimensional unbounded orbits . in this kind of motion , although the isospin does not play a relevant role , remaining a constant of motion not coupled to the movement in the minkowskian spacetime , its sign is important to determine the shape of the potential energy and the location of the possible return point , that indicates the direction in which the particle escapes .    moreover , in the asymptotic region , considering the limits of low and high velocities , the two systems present orbits confined to a conical surface whose axis lies in the direction of the total angular momentum .",
    "although for an intermediary velocity we can show that the orbits are not confined to a conical surface , we infer that they are confined to the region given by the two distinct cones : the one referring to the newtonian limit and the one referring to the ultra - relativistic limit . for the same initial position of the particle , it is clear that the first cone has an axis closer to the radial direction and an opening angle smaller than the cone related to the ultra - relativistic limit .",
    "in addition , it is possible for both systems to allow stable closed orbits in the newtonian limit , if the energy of the particle is negative . in all of these asymptotic motions ,",
    "the isospin is still not coupled to the movement in the external space , but is no longer a constant of motion , as it precessionates in the internal space .",
    "the radial component indeed seems to play the role of an `` electric charge '' in the minkowskian spacetime and its sign is fundamental in the shape of the effective potential energy , which determines the possibility of closed orbits .",
    "what is interesting to notice is the analogy between this asymptotic motion and the motion of a single electric charge in the presence of a magnetic monopole . as the fields of both systems , asymptotically ,",
    "are interpreted as magnetic monopoles , one could expect to recover at least some results from classical electromagnetism if the quadriforce and isospin s evolution equations proposed were consistent .",
    "and we indeed obtained some of these results : in the limits of high and low velocities , the particle is constrained to move over a conical surface , just as in the case of an electric charge in the presence of a monopole ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the radial and azimuthal motions are not exactly the same in both cases , but this is not unexpected since we are dealing with two very different systems in essence ( e.g. , the symmetry group of the systems involved in this work is @xmath0 , while for electromagnetism , it is @xmath97 ) .",
    "therefore , this simple analogy can give important clues about our choice for the equation of the quadriforce and that of the isospin s precession .",
    "finally , we remark that , although the systems of a particle interacting with a bps monopole and a particle interacting with a julia - zee dyon seem very similar , they have important differences . in the special cases considered previously ( radial and asymptotic motion ) , these differences are revealed by the appearance of an extra factor multiplying the radial component of the isospin .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the radial component is similar to an electric charge and the new factor carries the constant of the dyon @xmath79 that is responsible for the electric charge of the entity ."
