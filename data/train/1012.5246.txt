    "is not a perfect flat sheet .",
    "recent experimental observations have found ripples in suspended sheets of graphene  @xcite .",
    "atomistic simulations of graphene suggest that the strong bonds between carbon atoms in graphene is responsible for the ripples  @xcite .",
    "controlling the creation of one and two - dimensional periodic ripples is possible in suspended graphene sheets by using both externally and thermally generated strains  @xcite .",
    "tensional strain in monolayer graphene affects the electronic structure of graphene . for example strains larger than @xmath1 changes",
    "graphene s band structure and leads to the opening of an electronic gap  @xcite .",
    "the strain can generate a bulk spectral gap in the absence of electron - electron interaction as was found within linear elasticity theory in combination with a tight - binding approach  @xcite . in recent experiments the buckling strain of a graphene sheet that was positioned on top of a substrate was found to be six orders of magnitude larger ( i.e. @xmath2 ) than for graphene suspended in air  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some experiments showed that compressed rectangular monolayer graphene on a plastic beam with size 30@xmath3100 @xmath4 is buckled at about 0.7@xmath5 strain  @xcite .",
    "these experiments indicate that in spite of the infinitely small thickness of the monolayer of graphene , supporting graphene by various substrates enhances the buckling strain considerably beyond the very small values ( @xmath6 ) obtained from elasticity theory ( for very thin plate ) using classical euler analysis  @xcite .",
    "although elasticity theory predicts that the very small thickness of graphene yields a zero flexural rigidity but the bond - angle effects on the c - c interatomic interaction ( three body terms in brenner s potential ) gives a non zero flexural rigidity for graphene  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , elasticity theory indicates that the dimensionless critical load ( buckling load ) parameter depends on the thickness , radius and mechanical properties of the circular plate .",
    "it is found that it decreases nonlinearly with the thickness - radius ratio and approaches a constant value for very small thickness - radius ratios , i.e. the kirchhoff buckling load factor , independent of the boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "using computer simulations it is possible to calculate various thermomechanical properties of new nano scale objects and to propose new nano - structures  @xcite .",
    "graphene as a nano balloon  @xcite is such an example where , first - principles density functional theory was used to investigate the penetration of helium atoms through a graphene monolayer with defects  @xcite .",
    "density functional theory has been employed to investigate the structural , electronic and mechanical properties of rectangular graphene nanoribbons subjected to boundary stress  @xcite and central load  @xcite .",
    "larger values for the 2-dimensional young s modulus with respect to the one for bulk graphene  @xcite were predicted and a decreasing 2-dimensional young s modulus with respect to the size was reported for small size ( @xmath7 1 - 5 nm ) of graphene nanoribbons  @xcite .",
    "recently , we studied the possible deformations of rectangular graphene nano - ribbons ( gnrs ) at room temperature under axial strain for both free and laterally supported boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "we found several longitudinal sinusoidal deformation modes for different sizes of gnrs and investigated the thermal stability of buckled gnrs .",
    "in such a study the calculation of the free energy difference is important in order to compare the stability of various structural states of stressed graphene .",
    "thermodynamic integration and the perturbation method are two time consuming methods that have been used to calculate the difference in free energy  @xcite .",
    "but a more approporiate approach is based on the jarzynski  @xcite identity that is valid for non - equilibrium simulations and is applicable to the study of the stability of compressed and stretched graphene .    here",
    ", we study the mechanical stiffness of circular monolayer graphene ( cmg ) by investigating its linear response to strain . using the stress - strain curve in the linear regime ,",
    "we obtain young s modulus and the pre - stress in the cmgs which we found to be in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "our simulations introduce a way to calculate pre - stresses which , to the best of our knowledge , is the first time that they have been calculated . after continuing the compression ,",
    "cmg starts to buckle .",
    "the buckling strain in most cases are larger than the predictions from elasticity theory .",
    "moreover the stability of a new state of radial compressed cmg which we call _ nano - bowl _ graphene ( nbg ) , and the optimum size of cmg are studied by using atomistic simulations and the jarzynski identity for the calculation of the free energy  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that such a free energy calculation approach is used in the field of thermomechanical properties of graphene .",
    "recently , colonna _ et al _ used the free energy integration based method to explain the melting properties of graphite  @xcite . our nano - scale bowl like structure for cmg is a buckled state of the thinnest material in the world .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we introduce the atomistic model , the simulation method and a discussion on the jarzynski s equality as a method to estimate the free energy difference between two states within a non - equilibrium simulation . in sec.3",
    "we present our numerical results .",
    "estimation of the young s modulus and pre - stresses , estimation of the buckling thresholds , the free energy changes during compression of the cmg and the stability of the obtained bowl like shape of the compressed cmg are the main results of this study . after giving our results for buckling , we present the prediction from elasticity theory for the buckling of a circular plate and compare them to the one obtained from molecular dynamics simulation . also a discussion on the effect of the thickness of graphene on its mechanical properties",
    "is presented . in sec.4",
    "we conclude the paper .",
    "classical atomistic molecular dynamics simulation ( md ) is employed to simulate compressed suspended cmg using brenner s bond - order potential  @xcite .",
    "a rigidly clamped boundary condition was imposed on a cmg with inner initial radius @xmath8 .",
    "the boundary atoms were located in the radial distances @xmath9 $ ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] we depict a schematic model for both side view and top view of a cmg under radial stress with clamped boundary condition and list all relevant variables describing cmg under radial stress .",
    "we simulated the system at room temperature and 50  k by employing a nose - hoover thermostat .",
    "total number of atoms inside the boundary varies from 2224 to 18148 and there are 300 to 850 atoms at the boundaries .",
    "initially the coordinates of all atoms are put in a flat surface of a honey comb lattice with nearest neighbor distance equal to 1.42     and the initial velocities in each direction were extracted from a maxwell - boltzman distribution for the given temperature .",
    "first we equilibrated the system during a time @xmath10 ( _ process ` s ' _ ) , then we started to compress the system in the radial direction ( _ process ` i ' _ ) with the rate of compression @xmath11=0.48  m / s .",
    "the radius ( @xmath12 ) at time @xmath13 during the process ` i ' and the absolute value of the boundary strain are @xmath14 when compressing the system , the radius of the system is reduced by very small steps ( 0.012   ) to achieve a quasi - stable situation . after each compression step , we wait 2.5  ps to allow the system to relax .",
    "note that the initial radius @xmath8 is for a perfect flat sheet which is not necessarily the equilibrium radius of the system ( i.e. optimum size ; @xmath15 ) as we will find later . at the end of process ` i ' we relaxed the system to the new obtained radius @xmath16 where @xmath17 , ( _ process ` ii ' _ ) .",
    "for example for @xmath18 nm , setting @xmath19=500  ps with @xmath10=250  ps gives a small radial strain @xmath201.2@xmath5 + an important theoretical property is the free energy which is a global property which depends on the extent of the configuration space accessible to the system . in general",
    "this phase space is huge , but in practice it is sufficient to obtain an estimate of only the difference of the free energy between two related states of the system .",
    "this difference corresponds to the relative probability of finding the system in one state as opposed to the other .",
    "thermodynamic integration and perturbation method are two common approaches to calculate this difference in the free energy  @xcite . in traditional methods",
    "( for example in the perturbation method ) only when two states are close in their phase - space coverage , the convergence of the algorithm is good  @xcite .",
    "a robust and more general approach , which is also valid for non - equilibrium thermodynamics , is based on the jarzynski equality  @xcite whose only requirement is a slow ( quasi static ) transformation between the two states ( which not necessarily have to be close in phase space ) .    due to the application of external forces on the boundary of the cmgs ,",
    "an equilibrium approach is no longer applicable and non - equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation is needed . in the present paper",
    "we are interested to find the change in the difference between the free energy of two states : the initial non - compressed graphene membrane and a new found state of compressed cmg which we call _ nano - bowl _ graphene ( nbg ) . in the ideal case with infinitely small or quasi - static transformation of the parameters of the system",
    ", the system will evolve along a path starting from state ` a ' to state ` b ' .",
    "in such a case the total work done on the system is equal to the difference between the helmholtz free energy of the two states independent of the used path ( i.e. second law of thermodynamics ) .",
    "by contrast when the system evolves with a _ finite _ rate , as in common molecular dynamics simulations , the total work depends on the microscopic initial conditions and the above mentioned equality fails , i.e , @xmath21 .",
    "independent of the path and the evolution rate between two thermodynamical states , jarzynski found the following equality between the difference of the free energy and the total work done on the system  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the averaging is done over the possible realizations of the switching process between the initial and the final state .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ jeq ] ) connects the difference of the equilibrium free energy between states ` a ' and ` b ' and the non - equilibrium work done when going from ` a ' to ` b ' even in the presence of a thermostat  @xcite .    for sufficiently slow switching between the states ` a ' and ` b ' the obtained values for @xmath24 are distributed gaussian and only the two first terms of the expansion according to eq .",
    "( [ jeq ] ) will survive , i.e. @xmath25 , here the second term is the dissipated work as a consequence of fluctuations in @xmath24  @xcite . when the parameters are changed with a finite rate , @xmath24 will depend on the microscopic initial conditions of the system and the reservoir ( i.e. thermostat ) and the average of @xmath24 becomes larger than @xmath26 , @xmath27 higher evolution rates result in a larger difference @xmath28 ( larger @xmath29 ) ( for more discussion see ref .",
    "moreover it is important to mention that the value of @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ jeq ] ) should be obtained through a high precision calculation .",
    "we compressed the system during process ` i ' and calculated the total force applied on the boundary atoms at time @xmath13 ( @xmath31 ) with radius @xmath12 .",
    "we find the applied force on the inside boundary atoms ( @xmath32 ) as the minus of the force acting on the boundary atoms .",
    "the corresponding radial boundary stress on the inside region is calculated by @xmath33 we performed several simulations for different radius @xmath8 at @xmath34=300  k , @xmath10=25  ps , and the thickness of cmg @xmath35 nm  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figft](a ) shows the variation of the radial boundary stress ( -@xmath36 ) versus radial strain , i.e. stress - strain curve , for the two radii @xmath8=6 and 12  nm . we found that before buckling , during process ` i ' , the radial boundary stress increases linearly , and satisfies a simple linear relation between stress and strain , @xmath37 . for small strains anharmonicity",
    "is weak  @xcite . by calculating the slopes of the dashed lines given in fig .",
    "[ figft](a ) , we found the ( effective ) young s modulus ( @xmath38 ) for different radii and listed them in table  [ table0 ] .",
    "the obtained young s modulus are in the range of recent experimental measured values , i.e. 0.5 - 1.01 tpa  @xcite .",
    "notice that the obtained young s modulus depends on the used value for the thickness . in the case of a single atom thick membrane ( graphene ) , one should be careful about the definition and dimension of the young s modulus .",
    "since external stress is applied on the boundary of graphene which is an almost one dimensional curve , ( here the perimeter of the cmg ) , thus the exact unit for @xmath38 should be n / m ( or tpa ) .  for comparison purposes we listed @xmath38s with tpa   unit  @xcite in the second row of table  [ table0 ] and also showed it in the inset of fig .  [ figft](a ) . however usually by dividing this number by the thickness of graphene ,",
    "@xmath38 is reported in pascal  @xcite .",
    "here we used for the thickness @xmath39=3.35    as done in the experimental papers and therefore there should be no misinterpretation . in fig .",
    "[ figft](a ) the y - intercept , @xmath40 , is the pre - stress in the system , which occurs because our initial system with radius @xmath8 is not in an equilibrium state with optimum radius .",
    "the pre - stresses are 2.34 and 1.946 gpa for the two radii @xmath8=6 , 12  nm , respectively .",
    "these pre - stresses are of the same order of magnitude as the values , e.g. 2.23 and 1.19 gpa that were measured on two flakes with diameter 1 and 1.5 @xmath41  @xcite and are also in agreement with those found in our previous study on gnrs  @xcite . at zero strain , the sign of the pre - stresses indicate that the inside atoms exert an inward stress on the boundary atoms . furthermore , note that here ( except for the two smallest cmgs ) young s modulus varies ( around 0.525 tpa ) with respect to the size of the cmgs .",
    "young s modulus of graphene nano - ribbons depends on the size of the system .",
    "the chrematistic length of graphene ( 8 - 10 nm  @xcite ) is a measure of the range over which the deformations in one region of graphene are correlated with those in another region , so the applied boundary stresses on the edges do not affect the system beyond this characteristic length .",
    "we expect that our system with radius less than the characteristic length ( @xmath4212 nm ) will show a larger @xmath38 .",
    "but we believe that this behavior depends also on the applied boundary condition , i.e. clamped boundary condition .",
    "@xcite and hod  _ et al _  @xcite used density functional theory and found a larger value for @xmath38 for smaller size graphene nano - ribbons ( less than 6 nm ) and reported a decreasing @xmath38 with increasing size of nano - ribbons .        beyond the linear regime and during process `",
    "i ' , we estimate the critical buckling stress .",
    "the rapid increase of the lateral deflection with load near the buckling threshold defines experimentally the buckling stress  @xcite . in our simulations we estimated the buckling points as the points where the roughness of the system suddenly increases . in fig .",
    "[ figft](b ) we show the variation of the root mean square displacement -@xmath43- ( rms ) of the z - component of the cmg versus applied strain for two radii @xmath8=6 and 12  nm .",
    "the buckling point is obtained with a uncertainly which increases with decreasing size of the membrane which results in larger error bars on the buckling strain for small systems . the sudden change in the slope of these curves",
    "are directly related to the buckling threshold ( solid arrows in fig .",
    "[ figft](b ) ) . for small applied strain ( i.e. below the buckling points )",
    "@xmath43 exhibits random fluctuations which are due to the applied boundary stress and the thermal fluctuations .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ figft](b ) shows the depth , @xmath44 ( the z - components of the atoms in the center of cmg ) , of the buckled cmg versus strain which exhibits a clear nonlinear dependence .",
    "it is interesting to note that we found that for larger sizes ( i.e. @xmath45 nm ) the buckling strain is only slightly modified . in this limit",
    "the size of cmgs are beyond the characteristic length of graphene  @xcite .",
    "usually , the mechanical properties of graphene are found to be unchanged for systems that have larger sizes than the characteristic length  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is not necessary to simulate systems with larger radii .",
    "the boundary strains ( @xmath46 ) are listed in table  [ table0 ] .",
    "the obtained values show a non - linear decrease with increasing radius as shown by solid dots in fig .",
    "[ figft](c ) .",
    "larger buckling strains are found for smaller systems .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by recent quantum molecular dynamics simulation  @xcite , where for a small system with size 1.99@xmath30.738 @xmath47 a buckling strain of 0.8@xmath5 was found .         .young",

    "in summary , when applying an increasing radial force on the boundary of circular monolayer graphene , first a linear response regime appears which enables us to estimate young s modulus and pre - stresses , which are found to be in agreement with experiments . when continuing compression , at a critical radial force , graphene starts to buckle .",
    "the computed critical buckling strains are larger than those found from elasticity theory .",
    "these states are new thermodynamically buckled stable states which we called _ nano - bowl_. in order to investigate the thermodynamical stability of _ nano - bowls _ , we used a non - equilibrium computational method based on the jarzynski identity .",
    "this identity enables us to calculate the difference in the free energy between the initial non - compressed state and the buckled states .",
    "also the optimum radius of circular graphene , where there is no boundary stress , can be estimated by looking at the minimum in the free energy curve . at room temperature",
    "the _ nano - bowl _ is more stable than the initial non - compressed state which was pre - stressed .",
    "free energy calculations based on the jarzynski  @xcite equality can open a new approach to study various thermomechanical properties of compressed graphene .",
