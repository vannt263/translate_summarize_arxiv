    "the importance of cosmic flows to cosmology and to our understanding of the origin and evolution of large - scale structures as well as earlier observational and theoretical work on the subject have been reviewed by strauss ( 1999 ) and frenk ( 1999 ) in this workshop . on the observational side attention",
    "has focused on using promising new accurate distance indicators , such as the sbf method ( tonry 1999 ) and sneia ( schmidt 1999 , riess 1999 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the fp and tf methods have remained the dominant distance indicators in this field because so far the new methods either do not reach great enough depths or do not provide enough objects for a detailed mapping of the peculiar velocity field .",
    "most of the recent work in the field involving all - sky samples such as the sfi / sci ( da costa 1996 and giovanelli 1997 ) , mark iii ( willick 1997 ) , and shellflow ( courteau 1999 ) have relied primarily on tf samples .",
    "other recent investigations , using different distance indicators , have been specialized in one way or another ( efar colless 1999 , wegner 1996 , smac hudson 1999 , and lp10k willick 1999 ) and with few exceptions have concentrated on pre - chosen areas of the sky which do not render them optimal for all types of analyses .",
    "however , it is apparent from theoretical studies and discussions in this workshop ( davis 1999 , burstein 1999 , hudson 1999 , kolatt 1999 , zehavi 1999 , hoffman 1999 ) that there is much information to be gained from large dense surveys of peculiar velocities where selection and errors are well understood",
    ".    developments in instrumentation , particularly ccds , have greatly aided in obtaining improved spectra and photometry and brought much larger samples of improved data quality within reach .",
    "the new redshift - distance survey of a magnitude - limited sample of early - type galaxies reported here , comprising 1400 galaxies in about 900 objects within 7000 , is a substantial enlargement of the available data .",
    "the last all - sky elliptical galaxy survey , containing about 550 galaxies in 226 objects is still the 7s study ( faber 1989 ) .    for the past several years",
    ", the authors combined their resources to carry out an all - sky survey of nearby early - type field and cluster galaxies ( e and s0 ) in order to utilize the fp relation to measure their @xmath8 for redshifts @xmath5 , hence the name ` enear . '",
    "the general purpose of enear was to study large - scale motions based on early - type galaxies to a comparable depth to that reached by the sfi tf sample .",
    "such a sample will allow a comparison between the motions of spirals and ellipticals , based on different distance relations , and their combination will provide an even denser set of probes of gravity in the nearby universe .",
    "in addition , the new spectroscopy provides the important by - product of linestrengths with which galaxies in different environments can be compared .",
    "the enearf sample provides all - sky coverage , except for the usual lack of data along the galactic equator , and consists of galaxies with @xmath9 brighter than 14.5 mag and @xmath5 .",
    "morphological types are limited to @xmath6 .",
    "a number of catalogs were used to construct the initial all - sky catalog from which the early - type subsample was drawn . among them",
    "cfa1 ( huchra 1983 ) , ssrs ( da costa 1991 ) and the equatorial survey ( huchra 1990 ) at high galactic latitudes ( pellegrini 1990 ) , and the ors sample ( santiago 1995 ) at lower @xmath10 .",
    "combined these samples give full sky coverage to the desired depth , but required slight adjustments in magnitude and morphological type scales .",
    "a more detailed description of the sample will be presented elsewhere ( da costa 2000a ) .",
    "the new observations consist of 2200 spectra of about 1650 galaxies and 2100 @xmath0-band ccd images of 1580 galaxies .",
    "the bulk of the northern hemisphere observations were made at the mdm observatory using the 2.4 m hiltner and 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescopes .",
    "the southern hemisphere imaging observations were made using different telescopes at eso and the 0.9 m at ctio , while the spectroscopic observations were carried out primarily at the eso 1.5 m telescope .",
    "the data from both hemispheres were overlapped in order to get a good handle on possible systematic errors .",
    "northern hemisphere data extended to @xmath11 and southern hemisphere observations were carried out to @xmath12 .",
    "the observational setups , procedures , and data reductions are similar to those given in wegner ( 1999 ) and saglia ( 1997 ) .",
    "they will be described in detail in wegner ( 2000 ) and alonso ( 2000 ) .",
    "for spectroscopic data , there are about 500 galaxies with two or more observations and about 200 galaxies with measurements available in the literature .",
    "we estimate that our internal errors are typically 8% in velocity dispersion and 0.01  mag in mg@xmath13 . for photometric data , there are about 500 galaxies with repeated observations and over 300 with measurements publicly available",
    ". errors in the global parameters are estimated to be : 0.017  dex in @xmath14 , 0.08  dex in @xmath15 , 0.3  mag / arcsec@xmath16 in @xmath17 , 0.019 in fp = @xmath15 - 0.30 @xmath17 , and 0.09  mag in the total magnitude .",
    "the large number of repeated observations and the overlap with published data sets is key to bring all measurements into a common a system and to produce a homogeneous sample .",
    "the projected positions of the observed enearf galaxies on the sky in galactic coordinates is shown in figure  [ fig-1 ] where they are compared with the distribution of the spiral galaxies from the sfi sample . as can be seen while the total number of galaxies with measured distances is comparable to that of sfi ,",
    "the distribution of enear galaxies is visibly more clumpy , better delineating the high - density regions of the nearby universe . after assigning galaxies to groups",
    "the total number of independent objects is @xmath3 850 .",
    "figure  [ fig-2 ] compares the enearf sample with that of the 7s ( e s ) in three redshift shells , after grouping .",
    "this figure illustrates the relatively dense sampling accomplished by the enear project compared to the older data .",
    "it is important to note the differences between the two samples in the perseus - pisces region , a source of great debate in the past .",
    "the completeness of the sample , as judged by a comparison with the total number of objects that could have been observed , is about 70% complete within the chosen redshift and magnitude cutoff . the remaining galaxies are predominatly lenticular galaxies .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that the level of completeness of the sample is uniform across the sky .",
    "the enear sample also complements recent work on early - type galaxies in clusters ; at the moment 446 elliptical and s0 galaxies have been assigned to 28 clusters ( enearc ) and used to derive the @xmath7 relation .",
    "some of the clusters in the enearc sample include enearf galaxies while others lie beyond 7000to include previously well - studied clusters .",
    "information on the cluster sample and the distances and motions of the clusters will be reported in bernardi ( 2000a , b ) .",
    "in contrast to earlier work , groups and clusters with @xmath18  were identified by an objective algorithm applied to the original all - sky sample with complete redshift information .",
    "fainter galaxies were assigned to the identified groups or clusters using well - defined criteria .",
    "systems with more than five early - type member galaxies were used in the definition of the distance relation .",
    "the adopted membership assignment procedure is considerably superior to those utilized in the past when only incomplete redshift information was available .",
    "the identification of groups also permits a much improved grouping of galaxies , which is critical for studies of the peculiar velocity field using early - type galaxies .    in bernardi ( 1998 )",
    "we have used this objective membership assignment to compare the properties of early - type galaxies in different environments using the mg@xmath13 line index and the central velocity dispersion @xmath2 .",
    "we have found that the mg@xmath19 relation does not show any dependence on environment .",
    "this result favors a scenario of formation and evolution of early - type galaxies in which the bulk of stellar populations in galactic spheroids formed at high redshift ( @xmath20 ) , no matter whether such spheroids now reside in high or low density regions .",
    "furthermore , the lack of environmental effects also supports the assumption that the empirical distance indicators such as the @xmath7 relation determined using cluster galaxies , are universal ; this is a crucial assumption for peculiar velocity field analyses .",
    "we use our homogeneous data for 28 clusters / groups to determine an internally consistent , bias corrected @xmath7 relation ( bernardi 2000b ) . we have fitted the following regression : @xmath21 these coefficients are quite close to those found by the 7s ( faber 1989 ) .",
    "the scatter in the derived distance relation corresponds to a distance error of about 19% per galaxy , comparable to what is obtained for the fp relation .",
    "the above @xmath7 relation is used to find distances and peculiar velocities for all objects ( individual galaxies and groups ) in the enearf sample . using the radial components of the peculiar velocity we fit a a dipole flow model for which we find ( da costa 2000b ) :    @xmath22  ,   @xmath23 , and   @xmath24 .",
    "this direction is close to the direction of the lg motion and consistent to the one found in the recent cluster study of dale ( 1999 ) .",
    "the observational phase of the enear project is approaching completion .",
    "more detailed descriptions of all portions of the project and analysis will be given in a forthcoming series of papers .",
    "at this time our main goal has been to show the scope and coverage of the database . for peculiar motions ,",
    "the enear sample complements the sfi study for spirals in depth , number of galaxies , and accuracy of observations .",
    "our preliminary look at the data shows that the observed peculiar motions of the early - type galaxies in enear is similar to that found from the sfi ( zaroubi 2000 ) , suggesting that an accurate picture of the velocity field in the local universe is finally emerging .",
    "we thank the collaboration of s. zaroubi in the preliminary analysis of the data .",
    "we are also grateful to otvio chaves for his enormous contribution in different phases of this project .",
    "the spectroscopic observations in the southern hemisphere were conducted at the eso 1.5 m under the agreement between eso and the observatrio nacional .",
