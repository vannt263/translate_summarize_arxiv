    "in the last decade consensus has been reached that the galactic bulge has a boxy shape in the cobe / dirbe near infrared map @xcite because it contains a bar .",
    "this bar is tilted by @xmath6 degrees from the sun - galactic center direction , with axis ratios 1:0.33:0.23 , and a scale length of @xmath7  kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "most of these studies make use of horizontal branch red clump ( rc ) stars as tracers of the bulge 3d structure , due to their narrow range in color , brightness , and well calibrated absolute magnitude .",
    "however , recent analysis of the rc stars across the bulge area suggested a more complex x - shaped structure @xcite . along to @xmath4 axis , both above and below the plane , the rc appears to split in two components .",
    "both components become closer and finally merge at the latitude of baade s window ( @xmath8 ) and below , while they open up and diverge at higher latitudes both above and below the plane . the analysis by @xcite",
    "is based on the rc distribution from the ogle - ii photometry , while @xcite analyzed the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) from 2mass on a roughly symmetric field grid across the bulge . for the field at @xmath9 , in particular , @xcite had deeper sofi@ntt infrared photometry ( @xmath10  mag , in comparison to @xmath11  mag from 2mass ) as well as deep optical data from wfi@eso / mpg telescope ( @xmath12  mag , @xmath13  mag ) .    here",
    "we complete the analysis of the rc distribution across a much wider bulge area using 2mass data .",
    "the rc was mapped at positive and negative latitudes in 170 fields of 1  sq .",
    "size , within @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "our results are in agreement with previous studies , and extend their findings , showing the presence of an x - shaped structure across the whole galactic bulge .",
    "this analysis makes use of data from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog @xcite for the galactic bulge region within coordinates @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in order to map the rc position across the bulge , the whole area was divided in square fields of @xmath14 size , centered on each integer galactic coordinate , for a total of @xmath15 fields ( see fig .  [ area ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the incompleteness of 2mass in the region close to the galactic plane ( @xmath16 ) becomes rather severe at the rc magnitude , so this region has been excluded from the present analysis .    .",
    "a vertical dashed line marks the color cut applied in order to exclude from the analysis the foreground disk main sequence stars on the blue side .",
    "contours help the eye identify the two clumps , also marked by horizontal thick lines .",
    "bottom panel : @xmath17 luminosity function of the bulge rgb near the rc , both in 2mass and in the vvv data ( see text ) . ]    as discussed by @xcite , the most plausible explanation for the double rc is the presence of two structures along the line of sight .",
    "we therefore mapped the position of the rc(s ) across a large area , in order to deproject the bulge 3d structure .",
    "the procedure was the following :    _ i _ ) a @xmath18 cmd was constructed for each of the 170 fields ( fig .",
    "[ cmds ] ) and a color cut applied , fine tuned for each cmd in order to separate the bulge red giants ( rgb ) from the main sequence of disk foreground stars . the luminosity function of bulge rgb stars was constructed in order to identify the rc(s ) .",
    "_ ii _ ) using the rc(s ) as distance indicator , we assume that the two peaks seen at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ cmds ] are due to the presence of two overdensities along the line of sight . in order to map the overdensities in 3d space ,",
    "we associate a distance to each of the two peaks , and further assume that the width of each peak is entirely due to distance spread .",
    "this latter assumption lead us to overestimate the distance spread , because other effects can contribute to the rc width .",
    "the photometric errors at the magnitude of the rcs ( @xmath19  mag ) produce uncertainties of @xmath20  kpc in the rc width , while the differential reddening should account for @xmath21  kpc .",
    "in addition , the rc has an intrinsic width due to the broad metallicity distribution , and a possible spread in age and helium content , both hard to quantify .",
    "the assumption of the width of the rc peaks being due only to distance allows us to directly convert the luminosity function into a density map along the line of sight , by assigning a distance to the @xmath17 magnitude of each star close to the rc . in this way",
    ", the position of the main structures in the map will be correct , but their width along the line of sight will be overestimated .",
    "the distance associated to each rc star was calculated as : @xmath22 where the absolute magnitude @xmath23 was taken from the horizontal branch in the isochrones of @xcite for solar metallicity , and @xmath24 taken from the maps of @xcite .",
    "this makes the reasonable assumption that all the extinction happens between us and the bulge , with no dust being present between the two bulge rcs .",
    "_ iii _ ) distance histograms , corresponding to density maps along the line of sight , were constructed for rc stars in each of the 170 fields , using an averaged shifted histogram , for a bin width of @xmath25  kpc .",
    "figure  [ cmds ] also shows the luminosity function of rc stars , in the same bulge field , from the vista variables in the va lctea eso public survey ( vvv ; minniti et al .",
    "2010 ) . for this figure ,",
    "the casu v1.1 version of the catalog has been used vvv data release , on june 2011 . ] . in this field , the vvv survey reaches down to @xmath26  mag and the photometric error at the level of the rc is much smaller than in 2mass .",
    "the presence of a double rc is fully confirmed by vvv data .",
    "the faint rc is stronger in the vvv data , due to incompleteness of 2mass .",
    "in fact , the discrepancy between the two surveys increases at fainter magnitudes , due to confusion becoming stronger and stronger in 2mass .",
    "the vvv survey data will allow us to map the bulge 3d structure down to the galactic plane .",
    "extensive analysis of the upper rgb and rc morphology across the bulge area covered by vvv is ongoing and will be the subject of a dedicated paper ( gonzalez et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "in what follows we will discuss different sections of the bulge density maps constructed above .",
    "the panels in figure  [ dist ] show sections of the density map roughly parallel to the galactic plane , seen from above , each at a given galactic latitude .",
    "the region within @xmath16 is excluded from the analysis , so the innermost sections are at @xmath27 and @xmath8 , in the middle row panels .",
    "a cross marks the galactic center , assuming a distance of 8  kpc ( e.g. , @xmath28  kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sun would be at @xmath29 , below and outside the limits of the plots .",
    "the map in each panel is constructed merging 17 vertical color strips for the fully sampled sub - panels , each showing the rc star density along a given line of sight , at a given longitude ( x - axis ) .",
    "contour lines mark equal density levels , in steps of 5@xmath30 from the peak intensity .",
    "the section at @xmath27 has a vertical , black strip due to a dust lane that prevents us to reach the rc in 2mass , in this part . due to the opening of the cone of view",
    ", we see nearby things more expanded in the sky , than far away ones . in order to show the distortion introduced by this effect",
    ", we also show diagonal thin white lines at constant @xmath31 linear coordinate .",
    "the color scale has been normalized in each panel so that the peak density _ of that section _ is yellow .",
    "this stretching of the scale allows us to trace the shape of the bulge even far away from the plane , where stellar densities are much lower , but might give the wrong impression that the total number of bulge stars at @xmath32 is the same as it is at @xmath33 , which is clearly not the case . to clarify this ,",
    "the peak value of the density histogram ( corresponding to the lightest yellow ) is listed at the bottom of each panel .",
    "two overdensities can be seen in each panel : one closer to the sun , at positive galactic longitudes , and a more distant one , at negative longitudes . moving away from @xmath4 to larger longitudes ,",
    "one of the two structures gradually disappear , leaving just the bright one at positive longitudes , and the faint one at negative longitudes .",
    "the two overdensities get closer to each other for sections closer to the galactic plane , and they almost completely merge already at @xmath8 ( baade s window ) . this is the section that has been studied extensively in the past , and the structure that one sees here is consistent with a single , elongated overdensity , i.e. , the _",
    "bar_. clearly , only for lines of sight along to @xmath4 axis , i.e , in the central , vertical strip of each section , and only for @xmath34 we intercept both overdensities , resulting in a double rc .",
    "interestingly , in this map the far side of the x fades faster than the near side , when moving away from the galactic plane . in the next section",
    "we will investigate whether this is a real feature or an artifact of our data analysis .",
    "let us concentrate , here , on the 3d shape of the galactic bulge in a qualitative way .",
    "the panel at @xmath35 also shows the galactic bar , as traced by @xcite using ogle ii data for stars at a similar latitude . in the work of rattenbury et al .",
    "the derived bar was arbitrarily shifted in distance so that its center would be at 8 kpc .",
    "the angle between the structure we find and the line of sight is clearly the same as that of the rattebury s bar .",
    "the center of structure , at @xmath35 , is @xmath36 kpc away from the sun ( see below ) .    in fig .",
    "[ xshape ] , each panel shows a vertical section of the density map , parallel to @xmath37 axis , at a given longitude . the @xmath38 plane passing from @xmath4",
    "is in the central , middle panel .",
    "the sun would be at @xmath39 , outside each panel , on the left .",
    "lines of sight at different latitudes are shown as horizontal color strips , in each panel .",
    "again , the line of sight at @xmath40 is missing due to high extinction .",
    "thin white lines in each panel are lines of constant height above / below the plane ( @xmath2 linear coordinate ) .    the color map has been normalized so that the peak density along each line of sight gets the maximum yellow intensity . again , this allows us to trace the bulge shape even far away from the plane , but of course the density of bulge stars at @xmath32 and @xmath33 is not the same . looking at @xmath41 , the bulge splits in two components both above and below the plane .",
    "however , when moving to sections at positive longitudes ( top panels ) only the one closer to the sun is visible , while at negative longitudes ( bottom panels ) only the far one remains .",
    "although we do not have data in the region close to the plane , it is reasonable to assume that the elongated structures seen at @xmath42 would merge in the center , completing an x - shaped structure .",
    "if we make the exercise of joining the _ arms _ of the x above and below the plane , we find that the whole structure is approximately centered at a distance of @xmath43 kpc from the sun , which is consistent with the most recent determination of the distance to the galactic center .",
    "the latter was found to be @xmath44 kpc by nishiyama et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , @xmath45 kpc by ghez et al . ( 2008 ) , and @xmath46 kpc by gillessen et al . ( 2009 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the distance from the sun to the center of the x - shaped structure found here depends on how appropriate is the adopted value for the absolute magnitude of the bulge rc .",
    "uncertainties on this parameter may come from the broad bulge metallicity distribution function , and the unknown precise age and helium content of the bulge .",
    "however , this is beyond the purpose of the present paper , which addresses the _ shape _ of the outer ( @xmath47 ) galactic bulge .    in closing this section",
    "let us comment on the effect of incompleteness .",
    "incompleteness affects the present analysis in two ways .",
    "first , it artificially reduces the star density , especially in the faint rc ( fig .",
    "[ cmds ] ) . for a qualitative analysis of the bulge shape such as the present one",
    ", this might not be a serious bias .",
    "second , severe incompleteness produces a cutoff in the middle of the rc , so that the peak in the rc luminosity function looks brighter than it really is . indeed ,",
    "when fields at @xmath16 were tentatively included in the analysis , the map would show the bulk of bulge stars getting closer and closer to the sun , for lower and lower @xmath48 .",
    "this effect was not trusted as real , and this is where our decision to exclude fields at @xmath16 comes from . even for high @xmath48 , however , the extinction is highly variable on a field to field basis , and so it is the 2mass degree of incompleteness .",
    "the wiggles of the arms of the @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ xshape ] ( see , e.g. , the map at positive latitudes , for @xmath49 ) might in fact be due to differential extinction and thus incompleteness .",
    "here we investigate the density of rc stars in the faint and bright rcs .",
    "the rc densities not only reveal the structure and symmetry of the x - shaped bulge , but also provide a consistency check to address any lingering doubts that the brightness difference between the two rcs might be due to something other than distance .",
    "we measured the density of rc stars as a function of vertical height below the galactic plane , at longitude @xmath50 for the bright red clump , and at @xmath51 for the faint red clump ; at these latitudes the bright and faint rcs , respectively , are maximum ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the rc densities were measured from 30 arc - minute radius circular 2mass fields , in @xmath52 frequency histograms similar to @xcite and included a linear interpolation to remove the background counts .",
    "background subtraction would be significantly improved with the use of isochrone fitting techniques , but this is beyond the scope of the current paper . to compute the space densities of the rc stars from the number counts it was necessary to assume distances for the bright and faint rc populations ; we adopted 6.4 and 9.0  kpc distances for these populations , respectively ( see mcwilliam & zoccali 2010 ) .",
    "the vertical extent of our density fields ranges from @xmath53 to @xmath54 in latitude , and generally corresponds to vertical distances , @xmath2 , from 1.0 to 1.4  kpc .",
    "all projection effect have been taking into account when computing the stellar surface densities for the bright and faint rc populations .",
    "our results for the two regions are plotted in fig",
    ".  [ density ] , which shows that the faint and bright rcs possess similar declining trends in space density with distance below the galactic plane .",
    "however , if one considers only the angular extent below the plane ( i.e. , latitude ) , it is clear that the faint rc density declines much more rapidly with angle than the bright rc .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ density ] shows that at @xmath55 the faint rc has almost vanished , but there are large numbers of rc stars in the bright rc at this latitude .",
    "are 10@xmath56  pc@xmath57 .",
    "foreground and background rc distances of 6.4  kpc and 9.0  kpc were adopted from @xcite , who estimated them from @xmath58 .",
    "note that the two rc populations show very similar declining density trends with vertical , z , distance below the plane , but are markedly different when compared with angular distance ( i.e. , latitude ) from the galactic plane .",
    "in particular , at latitude @xmath55",
    "the background rc population is present , but barely detectable , yet the foreground population at the same latitude is enormous ; only at @xmath59 does the foreground rc density resemble the background at @xmath55 , where @xmath60  kpc for both populations .",
    "this supports our distance interpretation for the brightness difference of the two rc populations , and indicates that there _ is _ approximate density symmetry between the foreground and background bulge .",
    "however , a slightly higher density of stars may be present for the background , faint , rc . ]",
    "put in another way : with the assumption of approximate foreground - background symmetry of the bulge , the trend of rc density with latitude is consistent with a distance interpretation for the bright and faint red clump populations . given the extensive discussion of distance interpretation in @xcite , and the consistency check discussed here , we conclude that the rc brightness differences must , indeed , be due to distance .",
    "therefore , the foreground and background bulge rc densities possess approximate symmetry . in detail , however , our measured densities are slightly higher for the faint rc field .",
    "we believe that this difference is probably real , but could be due to errors in our analysis , such as poor background subtraction , or in the precise distances adopted for the two rcs .",
    "clearly , this small density asymmetry should be investigated further .",
    "the position of the rc(s ) was mapped across a large bulge area , using 2mass photometry . by using the rc(s )",
    "magnitude as distance indicator , density maps were constructed along the line of sight , for the region @xmath0 and @xmath61 .",
    "the main conclusion of the present paper is that in the milky way bulge has an x - shape , seen almost edge on , with an inclination of @xmath62 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the x is clearly seen within @xmath63 , with the closer arm remaining at positive latitudes while at negative latitudes only the farther arm is present .",
    "the _ arms _ of the x merge together both above and below the plane , for latitudes @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , in baade s window at @xmath8 one would just see an elongated structure , corresponding to the two lower arms being _ almost _ completely merged .",
    "this feature has been classically interpreted as the galactic bar .",
    "our crude measurement of the space densities of rc stars as a function of vertical height below the galactic plane is consistent with the adopted rc star distances , if the bulge structures studied here are roughly symmetric from front to back .",
    "this removes any lingering doubt about the interpretation of the rc @xmath65-band magnitudes as due to distance , and strengthens the conclusion that the bulge contains an x - shape structure .",
    "our densities are slightly higher for the background structure ; this possibility should be investigated with more sophisticated techniques .",
    "several galaxies are known to host x - shaped bulges ( e.g. , ngc  128 , ngc  3625 , ngc  4469 ) , and some numerical simulations predict their formation , with a particularly strong buckling of a bar @xcite .",
    "@xcite review some of the proposed mechanisms to form such structures .",
    "the x - shape structure seems to be relatively concentrated , with respect to other galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  4710 ) and probably is the dominant component in the inner 2  kpc .",
    "it remains to be understood how the bulge 3d structure can be reconciled with the other features , such as the presence of a radial metallicity gradient , the kinematic difference between the metal poor and metal rich component in baade s window and the behavior of the alpha element ratios , which seems to be constant in different fields ( gonzalez et al .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that all the properties listed above have been derived from observations on @xmath66 only .",
    "just as the shape turned out to be much more complex as soon as we analyzed a larger area , the other properties might turn out to be a partial view of the global picture .",
    "radial velocities of stars in the two rcs , at @xmath58 revealed no differences @xcite .",
    "however a similar analysis at @xmath67 reveals the presence of two peaks at @xmath68kms@xmath69 in the faint / bright rc , respectively ( vasquez et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "proper motions also do not seem to differ between stars in the two clumps @xcite .",
    "further investigations are clearly necessary to completely understand our bulge structure , kinematics , chemistry and , ultimately , origin .",
    "the present mapping traces the x - shaped structure across the whole bulge area and may help to guide further analysis , as well as to design future observations of the milky way bulge .",
