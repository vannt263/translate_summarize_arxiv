    "for more than two decades milgrom s modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) mond has been able to explain galaxy rotation curves which are conventionally considered as an evidence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) on galactic scales .",
    "mond modifies newton s second law of motion to @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the acceleration and newtonian gravitational potential , respectively ; @xmath4 is an effectively free function tending to unity in the limit @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being a new fundamental constant , which must have a numerical value of @xmath7 in order to match observations on a galactic scale .",
    "this theory looks like newton s when accelerations are large but is significantly different when accelerations are small . on galactic scales ,",
    "@xmath8 , so the newtonian dynamics is modified , but in a way that can fit spiral galaxy rotation curves .",
    "subsequently , bekenstein @xcite built a relativistic theory which has mond as a non - relativistic , weak - field limit , thus making the study of cosmology possible .",
    "in addition to the conventional tensor gravitational field , bekenstein s theory involves a vector and a scalar field , and is therefore dubbed teves .",
    "interestingly , it has been argued that teves could also explain the large - scale structure formation of the universe without recurring to cdm @xcite , thanks to the presence of the vector field @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that teves is equivalent to a vector - tensor theory of gravitation where the vector field has a non - fixed norm .",
    "they also showed that the correct mondian limit could be realized with a single vector field having non - canonical kinetic terms @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that a vector field in the gravity sector might be an interesting component of the universe ( indeed the model in @xcite and its generalized version we shall presented below in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ouraction ] ) could be used to explain dark energy and dark matter in background cosmology ) and merits more detailed investigations .",
    "the idea of a vector field coupled to gravity has a long worldline ( see for example @xcite for a review and @xcite for further references ) , but in this work we will focus on the model described in @xcite , which is the most well - studied one , and investigate its cosmological implications .",
    "this particular theory is based on a dynamical vector field coupled to gravitation that picks up a preferred frame and preserves general covariance .",
    "this vector field is unit - norm , timelike , and violates local lorentz invariance .",
    "it is called the ther field ( or simply  - field ) and we will refer to the associated einstein - ther theory as  - theory defined by the  - lagrangian .",
    "the  - lagrangian considered in @xcite is a special case of our general model introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ouraction ] ) below for a unit - norm vector field that includes terms up to second order in derivatives , and it has been extensively studied in various contexts @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the background cosmology and primordial power spectra of perturbations from inflation of a slight different model were also considered . here , we investigate these for the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also study the evolution of linear perturbation to the  - field during the radiation and matter - dominated epochs . as we will show below , if we restrict the parameter space of the underlying theory so as to satisfy the local experimental gravity constraints , @xcite , this perturbation becomes sourceless and decays during the epoch of inflation and late - matter domination .",
    "however , it is sourced by the evolutions of the photon and neutrino anisotropic stresses during the radiation era and early matter era , which have some imprints on the cosmological observables .",

    "[ sect : perturbationevolution ] , we present the evolution equations for the perturbation variables and then use them to show how the primordial spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations in this theory are unmodified and modified , respectively , on comparing them with the predictions of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the late - time evolution of the  - field perturbation and its effects on cosmological observables are also studied there .",

    "in this section we briefly introduce the general form of the -theory and derive the cgi perturbation equations which we will use to analyze the cosmological effects of the -field .",
    "the equations presented here are for general lagrangians .",
    "later , we shall focus on a specific class of such theory characterized by a linear lagrangian ( with @xmath12 , see below ) .",

    "the matter lagrangian is taken to be the same as in standard @xmath24 model .",
    "we treat the -field @xmath25 and inverse metric @xmath26 as the dynamical degrees of freedom and vary the action with respect to them to obtain the field equations .",
    "the former gives the -field equation of motion ( eom ) : @xmath27 where we have defined @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "the late - time evolution of the -perturbation is also investigated .",
    "in particular , we shall find that within the locally - constrained parameter space the -model will leave slightly different signatures on the perturbation evolutions from those left by the standard @xmath24 paradigm in general relativity , and so cosmological data on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and matter power spectra might place some constraint on the parameter space .      in this subsection",
    "we briefly summarize the constraints on the -model described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : aelagrangian ] ) .",
    "it has been well known that in the weak - field , slow - motion , limit and in the background cosmology the -model displays tracking behavior . for the former environment",
    ", it can be shown that in the presence of the -field the observed _ effective _ gravitational constant @xmath98 is a rescaling of the bare one @xmath99 @xcite by ( note that here our @xmath97s have different signs from those in @xcite ) @xmath100 and in the latter environment the observed gravitational constant @xmath101 is also a rescaling of @xmath102 but with a different factor @xcite @xmath103 correspondingly , we define @xmath104 and @xmath105 to be used below .",
    "note that the rescaled @xmath106 is generally not equal to @xmath14 and as such the background cosmic expansion rate will be different from that in standard gr .",
    "however , we note that the numerical value of gravitational constant we find in the textbooks and use in the numerical calculations is _ not _ @xmath14 but rather the locally - measured @xmath98 .",
    "it is possible to obtain limits on non - local values of @xmath107 by considering the primordial nucleosynthesis of light elements ( see for example ref .",
    "if @xmath108 then we have @xmath109 , which indicates that the background cosmological dynamics will be exactly the same as _ assuming _ standard gr @xcite ; otherwise we can use constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis on the value of gravitational constant to show that @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "however , note that the particle - horizon size at the epoch of neutron - proton freeze - out ( @xmath111 ) , which is most sensitive to variations in the value of @xmath107 , is only @xmath112 and this causally linked region expands in size by about a factor of @xmath113 by the present - day to a size @xmath114 which is a sub - galactic scale but there has then been local gravitational collapse by a factor of @xmath115 .",
    "such collapse may however also affect the local value of the gravitational constant @xcite , but we will not consider this in the present work .",
    "there are also constraints from the observations of parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameters @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for all the ppn parameters to coincide with those in gr ( otherwise the parameters may need to be fine - tuned ) one reduces the full four - parameter space of the model to a two - parameter subspace characterized by @xmath116 in addition , -theories contain five gravitational and -wave modes , which include the two usual spin-2 gravitational waves , and three additional modes : two spin-1 transverse -gravity waves and one spin-0 longitudinal -gravity wave .",
    "the speeds of the three additional modes are generally not equal to @xmath117 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that if these speeds are less than 1 then the high - energy particles will produce @xmath118erenkov radiation when passing through vacuum , which imposes stringent constraints on the model .",
    "however , as suggested in @xcite , these constraints do not apply if these modes propagate superluminally .",
    "the requirement that the additional -gravity waves do not propagate subluminally further limits the parameter space to @xmath119    finally , when the above constraints eq .",
    "( [ eq : parameterspace2 ] ) are satisfied , the positive energy requirement and the stability of additional wave modes @xcite also hold .",
    "in addition , we will have @xmath120 so that the big bang nucleosynthesis constraint does not apply .",
    "thus , we can see that , even after using all the current constraints , there is still a large parameter space remaining for the model . in what follows",
    "we shall ask whether linear - order cosmological observations such as the cmb and the form of the matter power spectrum could reduce this parameter space further , and as we will show , the answer is positive . however , the modifications are small and depend weakly on the model parameters , which mean that the data on cmb and matter power spectra can not give very stringent limits on the parameter space .      in this subsection",

    "( [ eq : constrainteta2 ] ) , the values of @xmath256 and @xmath249 in this equation are slightly modified that change the subsequent evolution of @xmath249 a little .",

    "this will generally involve a full search of the parameter space using for example the markov chain monte carlo method , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , as we discussed above , the constraints from the linear spectra may not be very stringent anyway .",
    "in this paper we have studied the cosmology of the einstein- ther theory . after presenting the general field equations for such theories in the cgi formalism , we focussed on a specific class of models described in eq .",

    "there are still some debates about this kind of choice , see however @xcite for a different and conservative point of view .",

    "second , as we have seen above , our conclusion that the primordial power spectrum of density perturbation is unmodified compared with gr relies on the fact @xmath293 so that the background expansion during inflation in our model is the same as in gr ( again the @xmath23 term is crucial here ) .",
    "if the @xmath23 term is not included , the local and cosmological gravitational constants are different , meaning that the background evolution during inflation is different from gr ; as a result the background quantities at horizon crossing , which determine the observables in inflationary models through the slow - roll parameters , may be different from those in gr  this means that the ea model will predict different shape of primordial density spectrum other than gr @xcite . for the gea model considered in @xcite , again the nonlinear",
    "@xmath266 makes the modifications to gr during early times small enough to be neglected , and as such the primordial power spectrum is also the same as in gr .",
