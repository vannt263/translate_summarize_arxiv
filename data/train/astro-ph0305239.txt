    "2002 ) and ( ii ) a reflection - dominated accretion - disc spectrum ( fabian et al . 2002 ) .",

    "indeed , iras 132243809 is among the most x - ray variable seyfert 1 galaxies known .",

    "event energies were corrected for charge - transfer losses .",

    "the most obvious features are the strong soft x - ray excess emission below about 1.5 kev and the presence of a sharp spectral drop at @xmath10  kev .",
    "if the 212 kev spectrum is fitted by a simple power - law plus edge model , the edge energy is @xmath11 kev ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the energy of the edge is significantly different from that of the neutral iron absorption edge at 7.1  kev .",
    "the flux absorbed by the edge is @xmath12 erg @xmath13 s@xmath6 .",
    "the edge can not be constrained by the mos data as the spectrum is background dominated above about 6 kev .",
    "some positive residuals can be seen at around 6.8  kev ( in the rest frame of the object ) .",
    "they are consistent with emission from h and he - like iron with a total equivalent width of about 200  ev .",
    "the detection of this emission , judged from an @xmath14-test , is marginal ( at about the @xmath15 confidence level ) .",
    "the strength of the line , when compared with the flux of photons which is absorbed and the likely fluorescent yield ( krolik & kallman 1987 ) , indicates that the absorber covers a solid angle @xmath16 .",
    "the observed spectrum shows little low - energy absorption and is consistent with interstellar absorption only . on the other hand , there is what appears to be a deep absorption edge at @xmath17  kev which would correspond to the k - edge of fe  xviii  xx .",
    "the sharpness of the edge requires that the ionization states of fe are confined to a narrow range .",
    "the absence of strong ( narrow ) emission at @xmath18 kev is in contradiction with an explanation in terms of a distant reflector .",
    "the observed features can be explained in terms of absorption if allowance is made for partial covering ( i.e. a patchy absorber ) .",
    "a partial - covering model was therefore fitted to the data .",
    "the model comprised a multi - component disc ( mcd ) model for the soft component , and a partially covered power - law for the hard continuum .",
    "in addition , this model required a further absorption feature around @xmath2  kev ( see section 3.1.3 ) , which is included by subtracting a gaussian line .",
    "a good fit was obtained ( @xmath19 ) using two absorbed power - laws , but a very steep slope , @xmath20 was required , which appears extremely high given the the present values found in agn ( c.f .",
    "fig . 1 of brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ) . allowing for an exponential cut - off in the power - laws did not significantly improve the fit ( @xmath21 ) but gave a more reasonable spectral slope .",
    "this model is illustrated in fig .",
    "the best - fit parameters were as follows : the mcd ( colour ) temperature @xmath22  kev , @xmath23 , @xmath24  kev , and the column densities ( and covering fractions ) of the line - of - sight absorbers were @xmath25 @xmath13 ( 0.06 ) and @xmath26 @xmath13 ( 0.77 ) .",
    "the fe abundance was about @xmath27solar with a 90 per cent confidence lower limit of @xmath28solar .",
    "the average effective slope of the cut - off power - law over @xmath29  kev is approximately @xmath30 .",
    "the temperature and ( absorption - corrected ) luminosity of the disc require that its inner radius is only about one gravitational radius for a @xmath31  m@xmath32 black hole . assuming the soft x - ray excess is physically described by a mcd model",
    "then the object would be super - eddington when bright .",
    "a broad absorption feature at @xmath33  kev , with an intrinsic width @xmath34  kev , is required in the above model with high significance ( fig .",
    "the equivalent width is approximately @xmath35  ev .",
    "the absorbed flux is @xmath36 erg @xmath13 s@xmath6 .",
    "the rgs1 spectrum is consistent with , but does not constrain , the presence of an absorption feature ( no data were collected from rgs2 in that energy range ) .",
    "other features in the rgs spectra can not be constrained with the available photon statistics .",
    "this deep absorption feature is similar to that reported by leighly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from the _ asca _ spectrum .",
    "those authors interpreted the feature in terms of resonant absorption oxygen from a relativistic outflow .",
    "a more prosaic explanation was put forward by nicastro , fiore & matt ( 1999 ) who interpreted the feature as resonance absorption , primarily by l - shell iron .",
    "their analysis gave a column density of the absorbing material of @xmath37 and an ionization parameter of @xmath38 with an outflowing and dispersion velocity of @xmath39  km s@xmath6 ( see also their fig .  4 ) .",
    "such an absorption model does not simply explain the large observed drop at 8  kev .      in the case of 1h  0707495 ( boller et al . 2002 ) we noted that the sharp drop at 7.1  kev could be the blue wing of a strong , relativistically - blurred iron emission line .",
    "this would require some unusual geometry or situation in order that such a strong line is produced ; the spectrum needs to be reflection - dominated .",
    "fabian et al . (",
    "2002 ) discuss one possibility involving a corrugated inner accretion disc ; an alternative would be gravitational light bending ( e.g. martocchia , matt & karas 2002 ; fabian & vaughan 2003 ) .",
    "the spectrum of iras  132243809 can also be fitted by such a model ( see fig  5 ) . fitting",
    "the 212  kev spectrum with a power - law continuum plus a emission line with a laor ( 1991 ) profile worked well with an emissivity index @xmath40 , inner and outer radii of @xmath41 and @xmath42 gravitational radii for the disc , and an inclination of @xmath43  deg . the disc inclination and emissivity were covariant in the fitting , and a wide range of inclination angles was possible .",
    "the equivalent width of the line is unusually high at 5.6  kev . to see whether such a strong line can be produced , we used a grid of ionized slab models produced by d. ballantyne ( using the code described by ross & fabian 1993 ) . with the abundances of metals at 7 times solar and galactic absorption we obtain a fit over the entire range from @xmath44  kev with a @xmath45 .",
    "some sharp deviations at the 23@xmath46 level occur at @xmath47  kev and again at @xmath10  kev . as with 1h",
    "0707495 this model requires the x - ray spectrum to be reflection - dominated .",

    "the bin size is 200  s. zero seconds on the time axis marks the start of the observation at 03:15:02 on 2002 - 01 - 19 .",
    "the light curve is divided into two high - flux states , a medium state , and a low state .",
    "the marked interval containing the background flare was omitted .",
    ", width=8 ]        the @xmath49  kev light curve of iras 132243809 shows strong and rapid variability with flux changes by about a factor of 10 ( fig .",
    "we have divided the light curve into four different flux states : ( i ) two high states with count rates above 2.5 counts s@xmath6 ( time intervals less than 20 ks and greater than 30 ks after the beginning of the observations ) ; ( ii ) a medium state with count rates between 1.5 and 2.5 counts s@xmath6 ; and a ( iii ) low state below 1.5 counts s@xmath6 .",
    "evidence in support of partial covering is obtained from a comparison of the spectra between a high - flux level and a low - flux level .",
    "the high - flux and low - flux spectra are constructed from those intervals were the source count rate is @xmath50 counts s@xmath6 and @xmath51 counts s@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the average fluxes of the two are different by a factor of three .",
    "these two spectra were fitted simultaneously with the same spectral model as in section  3.1.2 ( i.e. a mcd and a cut - off power - law model , and two absorbed power - law components ) .",
    "the fe abundance was fixed at 3@xmath52solar . a good fit ( @xmath53 ) was obtained , as shown in fig .",
    "the best fitting parameters were as follows : @xmath54  kev , @xmath23 , @xmath55  kev .",
    "the column densities ( and covering fractions ) of the absorbers for the high - flux spectrum were @xmath56 ( 0.66 ) and @xmath57 ( 0.53 ) , and those for the low - flux spectrum were @xmath58 ( 0.53 ) and @xmath59 ( 0.87 ) , where the column is in units of @xmath60 @xmath13 .",
    "thus when the flux dropped the absorption increased .",
    "iras 132243809 shows an unusual combination of spectral features : ( i ) a sharp spectral drop by a factor of @xmath61 at @xmath10  kev , ( ii ) marginal fe k emission lines , ( iii ) a flattening of the spectrum above 3 kev towards low flux states , ( iv ) strong soft x - ray excess emission , ( v ) a significant fe - l absorption feature at around 1.2  kev .",
    "the most plausible explanation for the spectral features ( i ) to ( iii ) appears to be provided by a partial - covering scenario .",
    "the soft x - ray excess is most probably due to a higher temperature of the accretion disc as often seen in nls1s .",
    "presently it is not clear whether the fe - l absorption feature is physically connected with the partial covering scenario .",
    "the lack of strong emission lines can be explained if the absorber subtends only a small solid angle as seen from the central black hole .",
    "an immediate consequence , given the variability in the absorber , is that the absorber must be located close to the central black hole , maybe even within the accretion disc region as suggested by e.g rees ( 1987 ) , celotti , fabian & rees ( 1992 ) and brandt & gallagher ( 2000 ) .",
    "the flattening of the spectrum provides strong evidence for partial covering , as an increased absorbing column and/or a larger covering fraction is expected when the source flux is low .",
    "although the partial coverer model explains the data well , the present photon statistics above the edge still do not allow us to constrain precisely the iron abundance , nor can we disentangle the unique contribution of the covering fraction or the absorbing column .",
    "the sharpness of the feature , if due to a photoelectric edge , is surprising . at 8.2  kev",
    "the absorbing matter must be partially ionized ( the threshold energies for fe  xix  xxiii are 7.93 , 8.07 , 8.21 , 8.35 and 8.49  kev ) in which case a range of ionization states is expected .",
    "these make the observed edge broad rather than sharp ( e.g. palmeri et al .",
    "alternatively the feature may be a neutral edge in approaching matter ( say in a wind or jet along the line of sight , e.g. chartas et al .",
    "the velocity of the matter is then required to be @xmath62 . a further possibility if the absorption is by approaching matter is that the feature is the start of a trough due to resonance absorption ( e.g. krolik et al .",
    "1985 , with fe  xxv / xxvi instead of o  viii ) .",
    "there is then a significant outflow of mass and kinetic energy from the object .",

    "precisely constrain the form of the sharp spectral feature in iras 132243809 and distinguish between different models we need a much stronger signal above 8  kev .",
