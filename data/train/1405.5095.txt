    "interactions at a center of mass energy above those attained at the lhc are continuously happening in the upper layers of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "they occur when ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) collide with air nuclei , being the highest energy so far recorded at @xmath2 700 tev , by fly s eye @xcite . in the decades to come , uhecr are the only way to explore such gigantic energies .",
    "our current understanding of particle interactions at these energies relies on extrapolations made from experimental data collected in terrestrial human - made accelerators , which in addition are hampered by the difficulties of placing detectors in the most forward region .",
    "after the first cosmic ray interaction , thousands of secondaries interact again and cascade down to the earth s surface , producing extensive air showers ( eas ) of particles .",
    "the pierre auger observatory detects those showers by sampling the eas at ground with a surface detector array ( sd ) , consisting of 1600 water cherenkov stations separated by 1.5 km and spread over 3000 km@xmath1 .",
    "fluorescence detectors ( fd ) collect light emitted by the passage of the charged particles of the shower through the air , allowing the reconstruction of the longitudinal profile ( lp ) of the shower and a calorimetric measurement of its energy . simultaneous detection by the sd and the fd is called hybrid detection and it has a dark night duty cycle of @xmath315% due to the fd . more details on the observatory can be found in @xcite and references therein .    the main goal of the pierre auger observatory is to unveil the origin and nature of uhecr . a number of breakthroughs and some very important steps towards this goal have already happened : stringent photon limits have ruled out most top - down production mechanisms , favoring the acceleration scenarios in astrophysical sources .",
    "in addition , current neutrino limits have ruled out some exotic production models and are to reach the fluxes of cosmological origin @xcite , guaranteed if protons were the primaries .",
    "a flux suppression at @xmath4 ev has been confirmed @xcite , being compatible with a gzk cut - off , but also with an energy exhaustion of the sources .",
    "arrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays have been shown to be unevenly distributed in the sky , being correlated with the positions of nearby agns , which act as tracers of the extragalactic matter distribution @xcite@xcite .",
    "the depth of the lp shower maximum is known to be sensitive to the primary mass composition , given that the deepest air showers occur for the smallest mass number @xmath5 . as the energy of the shower increases , the shower gets larger and reaches its maximum development deeper in the atmosphere . in general , a detailed simulation of the whole cascading process , accounting for all the multiparticle production details , is necessary to predict the position of the shower maximum as a function of mass and energy .",
    "thus , mass interpretation can only be achieved by comparing the actual experimental readings with the predictions of full air shower simulations using the different high energy hadronic models .",
    "results from the pierre auger observatory show a composition which steadily becomes heavier with energy when compared to the latest available models @xcite .",
    "the number of muons at the ground is also sensitive to the mass of the primaries @xcite , but it is also hampered by the ambiguity of the predictions of the high energy interaction models .",
    "the phase space of shower observables occupied by different primary masses often overlaps with that of the different model predictions .",
    "disentangling one from the other is of utmost importance and is one of the most compelling challenges in uhecr physics .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the pierre auger measurements relevant to constrain our knowledge of high energy physics . in section 2",
    "a measurement of proton - air cross section is presented and in section 3 , measurements are presented related to the muon production in extensive air showers , namely , different measurements of the muon number at the ground are described in subsections 3.1 , 3.2 , and 3.3 , and the longitudinal production profile is described in subsection 3.4 .",
    "the depth at which the parent cosmic ray interacts , @xmath6 , follows an exponential distribution @xmath7 where @xmath8 is inversely proportional to the p - air cross section , @xmath9 , that accounts for all interactions which produce particles , and thus contribute to the air shower development ; it implicitly also includes diffractive interactions .",
    "the depth required for the shower to fully develop is @xmath10 , being the tail of the @xmath11-distribution of proton showers directly related to the distribution of the first interaction point @xmath6 through @xmath12 .",
    "thus , @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the fraction of the most deeply penetrating air showers used .",
    "thus , @xmath14 is a key parameter : a small value enhances the proton fraction , but reduces the number of events available for the analysis .",
    "we have chosen @xmath15 so that , for helium - fractions up to 25% , biases introduced by the possible presence of helium and heavier nuclei do not exceed the level of the statistical uncertainty .",
    "figure [ crosssection ] displays the @xmath11 distribution for selected events , resulting in a value @xmath16 the average energy is @xmath17 ev which corresponds to a center - of - mass energy of @xmath18 tev in proton - proton collisions .",

    "see @xcite for details.,width=264 ]    the hadronic cross sections of the different high energy interaction models were multiplied by an energy - dependent factor @xmath20 to produce different predictions of the slope , @xmath21 .",
    "this allows us to directly relate the measured @xmath19 to the corresponding @xmath9 for a given model .    after averaging the four values of the cross section obtained with the different available hadronic interaction models we obtain : @xmath22 at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath23 tev .",
    "the results are presented assuming a maximum contamination of 25% of helium nuclei in the light cosmic - ray mass component .",
    "the lack of knowledge of the helium component is the largest source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "however , for helium fractions up to 25% the induced bias remains below 6% .",
    "more details of this analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the hadronic cascade is the main engine that drives the development of nuclei - induced eas .",
    "approximately 80% of the particles produced in high energy collisions are pions , of which approximately 1/3 are neutral pions .",
    "they rapidly decay into photons , feeding the electromagnetic ( em ) cascade . after only three hadronic generations , @xmath3 50% of the energy",
    "is already transferred to the em cascade @xcite , causing it to rapidly decouple from the hadronic cascade .",
    "after each interaction , the other 2/3 of the energy keeps feeding the hadronic cascade through charged pions every generation , until they decay into muons at a few tens of meters from the shower axis @xcite , and then leaving the central region of the shower .",
    "muons travel to the ground almost in straight lines , as coulomb scattering is less important than for electrons .",
    "they act as true messengers from the hadronic skeleton of the shower , and allow us to peer into details of the hadronic physics at the core of the eas .    despite of the pierre auger observatory being an experiment",
    "not having been originally designed to separately measure air shower components , we have developed techniques that allow us to assess the muon and the electromagnetic contributions , either by analyzing the time structure of the signals in the sd stations , or by analyzing different regions in terms of core distance and zenith angle of the showers , where the muon component is dominant .    whenever a charged particle of sufficient energy passes through water of a sd station , it produces cherenkov photons .",
    "after a few reflections into the wall material , made of tyvek , their distribution is isotropized .",
    "their concentration is sampled by the fadcs from three photomultiplier tubes viewing the water volume , before being absorbed by the water after @xmath3 100 ns .",
    "the observed signal is basically proportional to the track - length that the particle traverses in water , and therefore there is not a basic difference between signals produced by muons compared to those produced by electrons or positrons .",
    "given that electrons are far more numerous than muons and that they typically cascade down inside the water , while muons typically traverse the water without interactions but energy loss , the typical track - lengths of electrons in water are shorter . as a consequence ,",
    "the em component of the shower produces a signal distribution in time which is smoother than the muonic one , which is spiky and can be discriminated under some conditions .",
    "note nevertheless that converting photons might also produce signals with very similar characteristics to those of muons .",
    "in addition , the relative richness of muons compared to em particles in eas increases with the distance to the shower core , and also with the zenith angle of the eas .    the pierre auger collaboration has developed different techniques to assess the muon content of eas under different conditions , namely , 1 ) analysis of the muon fraction through the temporal structure of the sd signals in vertical showers , 2 ) measurement of a hadronic scale factor by analyzing the signal size in vertical hybrid events , and finally 3 ) analysis of the muon content in inclined hybrid showers .",
    "given that the number of muons at 1000 m from the core scales nearly linearly with the energy of the shower , the fraction of the signal attributed to muons to the total signal , @xmath24 is insensitive to the systematic uncertainty of the energy , which is 14% ( @xcite ) .",
    "two different methods were used to assess @xmath25 : a multivariate method , and a smoothing method .",
    "the basic idea of the multivariate method is to combine muon - content sensitive characteristics of the fadc signal to reconstruct @xmath25 using : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the reconstructed zenith angle of the shower and @xmath28 is the distance of the detector from the reconstructed shower axis .",
    "@xmath29 is the portion of the signal in fadc bins larger than 0.5 vertical equivalent muons ( vem ) , and @xmath30 is the normalized zero - frequency component of the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are sensitive to large relative fluctuations and short signals , which are the signatures of high muon content .",
    "we estimate the fit parameters @xmath31 using simulations described in @xcite .",
    "ev and at 1000 m from the shower axis vs. zenith angle , with respect to qgsjetii-04 proton simulations as a baseline .",
    "the rectangles represent the systematic uncertainties , and the error bars represent the statistical uncertainties added to the systematic uncertainties .",
    "see @xcite for details.,width=377 ]    the smoothing method is a low - pass filter , which was run a few times on the signal to gradually separate the low - frequency em component from the high - frequency one which is attributed to muons .",
    "firstly , the signal is smoothed by a moving average of size @xmath32 over the fadc .",
    "the window size @xmath32 was adjusted using simulations to follow the low frequencies corresponding to the em signal at large angles , while narrower windows are needed to extract it in vertical showers , where the em component is more similar to the muonic signal , resulting in @xmath33deg .",
    "the procedure was repeated four times , re - smoothing each time the output of the previous iteration .",
    "the final muonic signal is the sum of the non - smooth positive differences at each step .",
    "the muon signal can be retrieved by multiplying @xmath34 by the total signal .",

    "the ground signal was modified in the simulated events to fit the ground signal in the data .",
    "two rescaling factors were introduced : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath40 acts as a rescaling of the energy of the primary cosmic ray , affecting the total ground signal .",
    "@xmath41 acts as a rescaling factor of the contribution to the ground signal of inherently hadronic origin . @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "are then fitted to minimize the discrepancy between the ensemble of observed and simulated signals at ground , which can also reproduce the observed @xmath11-distribution , and is labeled as `` mixed '' in fig .",
    "the observed hadronic signal is a factor 1.3 to 1.6 larger than predicted using the hadronic interaction models tuned to fit lhc and lower energy accelerator data .",
    "none of the tested models calls for an energy rescaling .",
    "more details of this analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "after the arrival direction ( @xmath42,@xmath43 ) of the cosmic ray is determined from the relative arrival times of the shower front , the shower size parameter @xmath44 is defined through the following relation : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the model prediction for the muon density at the ground used to fit the signals recorded at the detectors .",
