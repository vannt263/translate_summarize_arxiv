    "separation of heavy isotopes in strong centrifugal fields is used for industrial production of enriched uranium .",
    "rotors of gas centrifuges ( gc ) rotate with linear velocity a few hundreds meters per second @xcite .",
    "the centrifugal acceleration can reach @xmath1 at the radius of the rotor of a few centimeters .",
    "nevertheless , strong centrifugal field is not the only factor which results into efficient isotope separation in gc .",
    "a range of physical processes are explored to produce an additional axial circulation which essentially increases the efficiency of separation of the gc .",
    "this secondary circulation is one of the key feature of the industrial gc .",
    "a pair of scoops located near the end caps of the gc are used to remove enriched and depleted gas mixture from the gc .",
    "simultaneously , they provide the additional axial circulation due to the mechanical brake of the gas",
    ". mach number of the gas in gc is of the order  7 because the sound velocity of the working gas @xmath2 is of the order @xmath3 at room temperatures .",
    "interaction of the gas with the scoop is accompanied by formation of strong shock wave which propagates along the rotational axis .",
    "[ fig : model ] schematically shows that the shock wave forms a spiral wave propagating from one end of the gc to another .",
    "it can reflect from the end caps of the gc forming waves running in both directions along the rotational axis .",
    "the amplitude of the shock waves is damped rather quickly . in the largest part of the rotor they propagate as small amplitude waves .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to consider them firstly in a linear approximation .",
    "it is well known that the waves can produce the flow of gas due to their absorption @xcite .",
    "these are so - called acoustic flows described by lord relei @xcite .",
    "they are produced due to transfer of the energy and momentum from the waves to the gas due to the molecular viscosity . this way the waves generated by the scoops can provide an additional mechanism of generation of the secondary axial circulation in gc .",
    "this mechanism can essentially differ from the conventional mechanism of the circulation generation .",
    "the waves can propagate and therefore transfer the breaking torque at larger distance from the scoops than it happens at the axisymmetric brake .",
    "exploration of this mechanism can change efficiency of the isotope separation and a working parameters of the gc .",
    "the axial secondary circulation in the gc is defined by the spatial distribution of the rate of absorption of the waves .",
    "application of the conventional equations to the calculation of the rate for dumping of the waves is not possible on several reasons in this case .",
    "firstly , strong centrifugal acceleration achieving @xmath0 dramatically changes the characteristics of the linear waves .",
    "secondly , the strong radial density gradient changing on 6 orders of magnitude per radius variation in @xmath4 , gives the rate of absorption changing also on 6 orders of magnitude .",
    "on these reasons it is impossible even to estimate the length of the wave propagation .",
    "r        this paper is devoted to the properties of the waves in strong centrifugal fields .",
    "this is not new problem .",
    "propagation of the linear waves in the rotating gas have been investigated in many works before .",
    "firstly , it is well known that there is an additional type of waves named inertial produced in the rotating fluid by the coriolis forces @xcite .",
    "these waves has been widely considered in application to physics of oceans and atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the stability of the rotating fluids has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , all these studies concerned incompressible fluid or gases in relatively weak centrifugal fields when the gradient of density along radial direction can be neglected @xcite .",
    "we consider the case typical for the gc used for separation of isotopes when the density changes on many orders of magnitude along the radius .",
    "strong centrifugal field of the gc makes the analysis of the flow of the gas complicated problem .",
    "density of the gas in typical gc varies 12 - 14 orders of magnitudes along radius from the wall of the rotor to the axis of rotation . in this conditions application of navier - stocks equations to",
    "the problem is possible only in the narrow region with size @xmath5 from the rotor wall ( typical rotor radius is @xmath6 ) . at smaller radius",
    "the gas is getting so rare that the path length of the molecules of the gas exceeds the rotor radius .",
    "hydrodynamic equations are not valid here .",
    "kinetic methods should be used in the so called knudsen region to describe the gas flow @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to understand what kinds of waves are possible in the gas subjected to the centrifugal acceleration typical for gc used for separation of the uranium isotopes .",
    "therefore , we use here a simplified model of the gas assuming that the hydrodynamic equations are valid everywhere .",
    "moreover , the case of dissipationless gas is under the consideration .",
    "this means that the heat conductivity and molecular viscosity are neglected . in next papers we consider the role of the dissipative processes and corrections into the model introduced by the presence of the rarefied gas zones where the hydrodynamic approximation is violated",
    "let us consider an ideal gas having molar mass @xmath7 and rotating with the angular velocity @xmath8 .",
    "the system of equations defining the dynamics of the gas in the rotating frame system is as follows @xcite : @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14  is the specific heat capacity for constant pressure , @xmath15- pressure , @xmath16 - density , @xmath17 - temperature and @xmath18 are the radial , azimuthal and axial components of the velocity .",
    "parameters of the gas can be presented as the sum of parameters of the rigid body rotation and some deviation @xmath19 where @xmath20  are the rigid body rotation pressure , density and temperature , respectively .",

    "violation of the hydrodynamic approximation near the axis has no importance for these waves because all the energy is concentrated in the region where this approximation is valid .",
    "however , the dumping decrement of this family of the waves can not be estimated directly from known formulas for damping of acoustic waves @xcite on a few reasons .",
