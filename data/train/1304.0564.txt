    "statisticians and epidemiologists had traditionally conceived of a confounder as a pre - exposure variable that was associated with exposure and associated also with the outcome conditional on the exposure , possibly conditional also on other covariates [ @xcite ] .",
    "the developments in causal inference over the past two decades have made clear that this definition of a `` confounder '' is inadequate : there can be pre - exposure variables associated with the exposure and the outcome , the control of which introduces rather than eliminates bias [ greenland , pearl and robins ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the literature has moved away from formal language about `` confounders '' and instead places the conceptual emphasis on `` confounding . ''",
    "see @xcite for historical discussion of this point .",
    "the causal inference literature has provided a formal definition of `` confounding '' in terms of dependence of counterfactual outcomes and exposure , possibly conditional on covariates .",
    "the absence of confounding ( independence of the counterfactual outcomes and the exposure ) has been taken as the foundational assumption for drawing causal inferences . such absence of confounding is alternatively referred to as `` ignorability '' or `` ignorable treatment assignment '' [ @xcite ] , `` exchangeability '' [ @xcite ] , `` no unmeasured confounding '' [ @xcite ] , `` selection on observables '' [ barnow , cain and goldberger ( @xcite ) , @xcite ] or `` exogeneity '' [ @xcite ] . today",
    ", at least within the formal methodological literature on causality , language concerning `` confounders '' is generally used only informally , if at all .",
    "the priority that has been given to `` confounding '' over `` confounders '' has arguably brought clarity and precision to the field . nevertheless , among practicing statisticians and epidemiologists , language concerning both `` confounders '' and `` confounding '' is common .",
    "this raises the question as to whether a formal definition of a `` confounder '' can also be given within the counterfactual framework that coheres with how the word seems to be used in practice .    in this paper",
    "we will consider various definitions of a confounder proposed either formally or informally by a number of prominent statisticians and epidemiologists .",
    "for each potential definition we will consider the properties satisfied by the candidate definition .",
    "specifically , we state and prove a number of propositions showing whether under each candidate definition ( i ) control for all `` confounders '' suffices to control for `` confounding '' and ( ii ) whether each confounder in some context helps eliminate or reduce confounding bias . as we will see below , only one candidate definition of those considered satisfies both properties .",
    "we consider also the implications that hold between the various definitions themselves .",
    "we let @xmath3 denote an exposure , @xmath4 the outcome , and we will use @xmath0 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 to denote particular pre - exposure covariates or sets of covariates ( that may or may not be measured ) . as noted in the penultimate section of the paper , the restriction to pre - exposure covariates could , in the context of causal diagrams [ pearl ( @xcite ) ] , be replaced to that of nondescendents of exposure @xmath3 . within the counterfactual or potential outcomes framework [ @xcite , @xcite ] , we let @xmath6 denote the potential outcome for @xmath4 if exposure @xmath3 were set , possibly contrary to fact , to the value @xmath7 . if the exposure is binary , the average causal effect is given by @xmath8 .",
    "note that the potential outcomes notation @xmath6 presupposes that an individual s potential outcome does not depend on the exposures of other individuals .",
    "this assumption is sometimes referred to as sutva , the stable unit treatment value assumption [ @xcite ] or as a no - interference assumption [ @xcite ] .",
    "we use the notation @xmath9 to denote that @xmath10 is independent of @xmath11 conditional on @xmath12 . for exposure @xmath3 and outcome @xmath4",
    ", we say there is no confounding conditional on @xmath5 ( or that the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 is unconfounded given @xmath5 ) if @xmath13 .",
    "we will refer to any such @xmath5 as a sufficient set or a sufficient adjustment set .",
    "if the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 is unconfounded given @xmath5 , then the causal effect can be consistently estimated by @xmath14 [ @xcite ] .",
    "we will say that @xmath15 constitutes a minimally sufficient adjustment set if @xmath13 but there is no proper subset @xmath16 of @xmath5 such that @xmath17 , where `` proper subset '' here is understood as @xmath16 being a strict subset of the coordinates of @xmath15 .",
    "some of the candidate definitions of a confounder below define `` confounder '' in terms of `` confounding '' via reference to `` sufficient adjustment sets '' or `` minimally sufficient adjustment sets . ''",
    "such definitions give conceptual priority to `` confounding , '' as has generally been done in the causal inference literature [ @xcite , @xcite , hernn ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "often after formal definitions of `` confounding '' are given , a `` confounder '' is defined as a derivative and sometimes informal concept .",
    "for example , in papers by greenland , pearl and robins ( @xcite ) and @xcite , formal definitions are given for `` confounding '' and then a `` confounder '' is simply described as a variable that is in some sense `` responsible '' [ greenland , robins and pearl ( @xcite ) , page 33 ] for confounding . although priority arguably has and should be given to the concept of `` confounding '' over `` confounder , '' applied researchers will often use the word `` confounder '' to refer to a single variable that is perhaps a member of a sufficient adjustment set but does not by itself constitute a sufficient adjustment set and this raises the question of whether this use of `` confounder '' can be given a coherent definition within the counterfactual framework .",
    "most of the definitions and properties we discuss make reference only to counterfactual outcomes . however , one of the definitions and several propositions make reference to causal diagrams",
    ". we will thus restrict attention in this paper to causal diagrams .",
    "we review concepts and definitions for causal diagrams in the ; the reader can also consult pearl ( @xcite ) .",
    "for expository purposes we follow @xcite , but the results in the paper are equally applicable to all of the alternative graphical causal models considered , for example , by @xcite . in short , following @xcite , a causal diagram is a very general data generating process corresponding to a set of nonparametric structural equations where each variable @xmath18 is given by its nonparametric structural equation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are the parents of @xmath18 on the graph and the @xmath21 are mutually independent such that the structural equations encode one - step ahead counterfactual relationships among the variables with other counterfactuals given by recursive substitution [ pearl ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "the assumption of `` faithfulness '' is said to be satisfied if all of the conditional independence relationships among the variables are implied by the structure of the graph ; see the for further details .",
    "a backdoor path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 is a path to @xmath4 which begins with an edge into @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite showed that if a set of pre - exposure covariates @xmath5 blocks all backdoor paths from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , then the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 is unconfounded given  @xmath5 .",
    "the definitions given below will be stated formally in terms of potential outcomes and causal diagrams .",
    "it is assumed that there is an underlying causal diagram which may contain both measured and unmeasured variables ; all variables considered in the definitions are variables on the diagram .",
    "whether a variable satisfies the criteria of a particular definition will be relative to the causal diagram . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    "we will consider settings with multiple causal diagrams where one diagram may have variables absent on another .",
    "here we give a number of candidate definitions of a confounder motivated by statements made in the methodological literature .",
    "we will cite specific statements from the methodologic literature ; we do not necessarily believe these statements were intended as formal definitions of a `` confounder '' by the authors cited .",
    "we simply use these statements to motivate the candidate definitions .",
    "as noted above , we believe statements about `` confounders , '' as opposed to `` confounding , '' have generally been used only informally and intuitively .",
    "as already noted , the traditional conception of a confounder in statistics and epidemiology has been a variable associated with both the treatment and the outcome .",
    "@xcite notes that whether such associations hold will depend on what other variables are controlled for in an analysis .",
    "this motivates our first candidate definition for a confounder .",
    "[ def1]a pre - exposure covariate @xmath0 is a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 if there exists a set of pre - exposure covariates @xmath1 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23    definition  [ def1 ] is essentially a generalization of the traditional conceptualization of a confounder .",
    "@xcite showed that if a set of pre - exposure covariates @xmath1 blocks all backdoor paths from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , then the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 is unconfounded given @xmath1 .",
    "hernn ( @xcite ) accordingly speaks of a confounder as a variable that `` can be used to block a backdoor path between exposure and outcome '' ( page 355 ) .",
    "a similar definition of a confounder is given in greenland and pearl [ ( @xcite ) , page 152 ] and in glymour and greenland [ ( @xcite ) , page 193 ] .",
    "this motivates a second candidate definition .",
    "[ def2]a pre - exposure covariate @xmath0 is a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 if it blocks a backdoor path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "the second definition is perhaps one that would arise most naturally within the context of causal diagrams ; the definition itself of course presupposes a framework of causal diagrams or variants thereof [ spirtes , glymour and scheines ( @xcite ) , @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite speaks of a confounder as `` a variable that is a member of every sufficient [ adjustment ] set '' ( page 195 ) , that is , control for it must be necessary .",
    "likewise , @xcite write , `` we will call a covariate a confounder if estimators which are not adjusted for the covariate are biased '' ( page  393 ) and hernn ( @xcite ) speaks of a confounder as `` any variable that is necessary to eliminate the bias in the analysis '' ( page 357 ) .",
    "note that a variable is a member of every sufficient adjustment set if and only if it is a member of every minimal sufficient adjustment set .",
    "this motivates our third candidate definition .",
    "[ def3]a pre - exposure covariate @xmath0 is a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 if it is a member of every minimally sufficient adjustment set .",
    "definition  [ def3 ] captures the notion that controlling for a confounder might be necessary to eliminate bias .",
    "the definition makes reference to `` every minimally sufficient adjustment set ; '' this will be relative to a particular causal diagram , a point to which we will return below .",
    "kleinbaum , kupper and morgenstern ( @xcite ) , in a textbook on epidemiologic research , gave as a definition of a `` confounder '' a variable that is `` a member of a sufficient confounder group '' where a sufficient confounder group is defined as `` a  minimal set of one or more risk factors whose simultaneous control in the analysis will correct for joint confounding in the estimation of the effect of interest '' ( page  276 ) .",
    "kleinbaum , kupper and morgenstern ( @xcite ) , however , define `` confounding '' in terms of association rather than counterfactual independence . as a variant of the kleinbaum , kupper and morgenstern proposal",
    ", we could retain the definition `` a member of a minimally sufficient adjustment set '' but use the counterfactual definition of `` confounding . ''",
    "this motivates the fourth candidate definition .",
    "[ def4]a pre - exposure covariate @xmath0 is a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 if it is a member of some minimally sufficient adjustment set .",
    "definition  [ def4 ] can be restated as follows : a pre - exposure covariate @xmath0 is a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 if there exists a set of pre - exposure covariates @xmath1 ( possibly empty ) such that @xmath24 but there is no proper subset @xmath16 of @xmath2 such that @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite likewise conceive of a confounder in terms of the presence or absence of confounding in such a way that coincides with definition  [ def4 ] when there is a single confounder ; when there are multiple sets that are sufficient or sets that are sufficient but not minimally sufficient , it is not clear how the definition of @xcite generalizes ; the definitions of @xcite can be adapted to coincide with definition  [ def4 ] .",
    "robins and morgenstern [ ( @xcite ) , section  2h ] say that @xmath0 is a confounder conditional on @xmath11 if causal effects are computable given data on @xmath0 and @xmath11 , but not on @xmath11 alone . in the framework of robins and morgenstern , if one were to take as the ( unconditional ) definition of a confounder that `` there exists some set @xmath11 such that @xmath0 is a confounder conditional on @xmath11 [ in the sense of @xcite , section  2h ] , '' then this would coincide with definition  [ def4 ] .",
    "@xcite conceive of a confounder as any variable that is helpful in reducing bias .",
    "hernn ( @xcite ) likewise speaks of a confounder as `` any variable that can be used to reduce [ confounding ] bias '' ( page 355 ) .",
    "geng , guo and fung ( @xcite ) use a similar definition for confounding . as noted by other authors [ @xcite , hernn ( @xcite ) ] , whether a variable is helpful in reducing bias will depend on what other variables are being conditioned on in the analysis ; a confounder should be helpful for reducing bias in some context .",
    "this motivates our fifth definition .",
    "[ def5]a pre - exposure covariate @xmath0 is a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 if there exists a set of pre - exposure covariates @xmath1 such that @xmath26 .",
    "definition  [ def5 ] captures the notion that controlling for @xmath0 along with @xmath1 results in lower bias in the estimate of the causal effect than controlling for @xmath1 alone .",
    "a number of variants of definition  [ def5 ] could also be considered .",
    "geng , guo and fung ( @xcite ) , for example , considered the analogous definition for the effect of the exposure on the exposed rather than the overall effect of the exposure on the population ; one could likewise consider the analogue of definition  [ def5 ] for effects conditional on @xmath1 rather than standardized over @xmath1 or , alternatively , for different measures of effect , for example , risk ratios or odds ratios rather than causal effects on the difference scale .",
    "definition  [ def5 ] , unlike other definitions , is inherently scale - dependent .",
    "thus , under definition  [ def5 ] , a variable @xmath0 might be a confounder for @xmath4 but not for @xmath27 or vice versa .",
    "this is an important limitation of definition  [ def5 ] .",
    "note , however , that some authors also consider `` confounding '' to be scale - dependent [ greenland and robins ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite ] and use `` ignorability '' to refer to the notion of unconfoundedness in the distribution of counterfactuals as given above .",
    "confounders have also sometimes been defined in terms of empirical collapsibility [ @xcite , @xcite ] , that is , if one obtains the same estimate with or without adjustment for a variable , then it is not a confounder . in the applied literature",
    "the approach is sometimes encapsulated in the `` 10 percent rule , '' that is , discard a covariate if adjustment for it does not change an estimate by more than 10 percent .",
    "it is well documented in the literature that collapsibility - based definitions do not work for all effect measures , such as the odds ratio or hazard ratios , for which marginal and conditional may differ even in the absence of confounding [ greenland , robins and pearl ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "such effect measures are sometimes referred to as noncollapsible . however , for at least the risk difference scale ( or the risk ratio scale ) a collapsibility - based definition of a confounder could be entertained and for completeness we consider it also here .",
    "such a collapsibility - based definition could be formalized as follows .",
    "[ def6]a pre - exposure covariate @xmath0 is a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 if there exists a set of pre - exposure covariates @xmath1 such that @xmath28 .",
    "definition  [ def6 ] , like definition  [ def5 ] , is scale - dependent .",
    "although not the focus of the present paper , in the we give some further remarks on the possibility of empirical testing for each of definitions  [ def1][def6 ] and for confounding and nonconfounding more generally .",
    "however , for the most part , notions of confounding and confounders , under these six definitions , are not empirically testable without further experimental data or strong assumptions .",
    "language about `` confounders '' occurs of course not simply in methodologic work but in substantive statistical and epidemiologic research . in the design and analysis of observational studies in the applied literature the task of controlling for `` confounding ''",
    "is often construed as that of collecting data on and controlling for all `` confounders . '' in this section we propose that when language about `` confounders '' is generally used in statistics and epidemiology , two things are implicitly presupposed : first , that if one were to control for all `` confounders , '' then this would suffice to control for `` confounding '' and , second , that control for a `` confounder '' will in some sense help to reduce or eliminate confounding bias .",
    "we would propose that if a formal definition is to be given for a `` confounder , '' it should in some sense satisfy these two properties .",
    "if it does not , it arguably does not cohere with what is typically presupposed when language about `` confounders '' is used in practice .",
    "we give a formalization of these two properties and in the following section we will discuss which of these two properties are satisfied by each of the candidate definitions of the previous section .",
    "we could formalize the first property as follows .",
    "[ prope1]if @xmath5 consists of the set of all confounders for the effect of @xmath3 on  @xmath4 , then there is no confounding of the effect of @xmath29 on @xmath4 conditional on @xmath5 , that is , @xmath13 .",
    "the definition makes reference to `` all confounders ; '' to make reference to all such variables , the domain of the variables considered needs to be specified .",
    "the domain here will be all pre - exposure variables on a particular causal diagram that qualify as confounders according to whatever definition is in view .",
    "see section  [ sec6 ] for some extensions .",
    "the second property is that control for a confounder should help either reduce or eliminate bias .",
    "the reduction and the elimination of bias are not equivalent and , thus , we will formally give two alternative properties , [ prope2a ] and [ prope2b ] .",
    "[ prope2a]if @xmath0 is a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 , then there exists a set of pre - exposure covariates @xmath1 ( possibly empty ) such that @xmath30 but @xmath31 .",

    "note that property  [ prope2b ] , like definition  [ def5 ] , is inherently scale - dependent and in this sense perhaps less fundamental than property  [ prope2a ] .",
    "for now we simply propose that for a candidate definition of a confounder to adequately capture the intuitive sense in which the word is used , it should satisfy property  [ prope1 ] and should also satisfy either property  [ prope2a ] or  [ prope2b ] .",
    "it would be peculiar if a confounder were defined in a way that it did not satisfy these two properties . in the next section we consider whether each of the candidate definitions , definitions  [ def1][def6 ] , satisfy properties  [ prope1 ] ,  [ prope2a ] and  [ prope2b ] . of course ,",
    "one possible outcome of this exercise is that none of the candidate definitions satisfy property  [ prope1 ] and either properties  [ prope2a ] or  [ prope2b ] ( or even that no candidate definition could ) .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section , this turns out not to be the case .",
    "definition  [ def1 ] was a generalization of the traditional epidemiologic conception of a confounder as a variable associated with exposure and outcome .",
    "for this definition we have the following result .",
    "[ prop1]under faithfulness , for every causal diagram , definition  [ def1 ] satisfies property  [ prope1 ] .",
    "definition  [ def1 ] does not satisfy properties  [ prope2a ] or  [ prope2b ] .",

    "this set @xmath1 satisfies definition  [ def1 ] for @xmath36 with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "next , we show that any superset of @xmath36 in @xmath34 will be a valid adjustment set for @xmath41 .",
    "assume this is not the case for a particular @xmath5 , and fix a backdoor path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 which is open given @xmath5 .",

    "we therefore propose that a confounder be defined as in definition  [ def4 ] , `` a pre - exposure covariate that is a member of some minimally sufficient adjustment set '' and that any variable that satisfies definition  [ def5 ] but not definition  [ def4 ] be referred to as a `` surrogate confounder .

    "the terminology of a `` surrogate confounder '' or `` proxy confounder '' appears elsewhere [ @xcite , hernn ( @xcite ) ] ; here we have provided a formal criterion for such a `` surrogate confounder . '' see @xcite and @xcite for properties of such surrogate confounders .",
    "interestingly , definition  [ def4 ] is closely related to definitions concerning confounders proposed by robins and morgernstern ( @xcite ) , though their definitions were not universally adopted by the epidemiologic community over the ensuing 25 years .",
    "robins and morgenstern ( @xcite ) were not principally concerned with how the word `` confounder '' is employed in practice when used in an unqualified sense , but rather with whether a particular variable would still , in some sense , be a confounder if data were also available on other variables . as noted above , robins and morgenstern [ ( @xcite ) , section  2h ] say that @xmath0 is a confounder conditional on @xmath11 if causal effects are computable given data on @xmath0 and @xmath11 , but not on @xmath11 alone . in the framework of robins and morgenstern , if one were to take as the ( unconditional ) definition of a confounder that `` there exists some set @xmath11 such that @xmath0 is a confounder conditional on @xmath11 [ in the sense of @xcite , section  2h ] , '' then this would coincide with definition  [ def4 ] .",
    "note that robins and morgenstern , in their definitions , in some sense go further than definition  [ def4 ] in having the investigator explicitly specify the other variables @xmath11 for which control might be made .",
    "this would indeed be useful in practice , though current use of language has not generally adopted this convention .",
    "it might in the future be helpful to distinguish between the unqualified use of the word `` _ _ confounder _ _ '' as defined in definition  [ def4 ] , and `` _ _ confounder in the context of _ _ having data also on @xmath11 '' as in robins and morgenstern ( @xcite ) .",
    "the former is arguably how the word `` confounder '' is often used in practice ; the latter would be useful in making decisions about data collection and confounder control .",
    "in the discussion above we have considered whether a covariate is a `` confounder '' in an unconditional sense . however , we might also speak about whether a variable @xmath0 is a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 conditional on some set of covariates @xmath97 which an investigator is going to condition on irrespective of whether control is made for  @xmath0 .",
    "definition  [ def4 ] above , the definition for an `` unconditional confounder '' could be restated as follows : a pre - exposure covariate @xmath0 is a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 if there exists a set of pre - exposure covariates @xmath1 such that @xmath98 but there is no proper subset @xmath16 of @xmath2 such that @xmath17 .",

    "however , conditional on @xmath102 , both @xmath43 and @xmath44 would be confounders .",
    "an analogue of definition  [ def4 ] could also be given for a particular causal parameter of interest rather than for the condition of nonconfounding in distribution @xmath13 .",
    "for example , @xmath0 could be defined to be a confounder for a particular causal parameter ( e.g. , the causal risk difference or causal risk ratio ) if there exists a set of pre - exposure covariates @xmath1 such the parameter is identified by adjusting for @xmath2 and if for no proper subset , @xmath16 of @xmath2 is the parameter identified by adjusting for @xmath16 [ cf .",
    "however , when we restrict attention to particular parameters we reintroduce some of the complications with cancellations that were noted above .",
    "for example , due to cancellations , a variable @xmath0 may be a confounder for the causal risk difference but not for the causal risk ratio [ cf .",
    "@xcite ] .",
    "we have restricted our attention in this paper thus far to pre - exposure covariates as potential confounders .",
    "we have done so in order to correspond as closely as possible to the discussion in the epidemiologic and potential outcomes literatures .",
    "however , within the context of causal diagrams , a somewhat broader range of variables could be considered as `` confounders '' in that all of the discussion above is applicable if we consider all nondescendents of @xmath3 as potential confounders rather than simply considering pre - exposure covariates .    throughout the paper",
    "we have given all definitions with respect to a particular underlying causal diagram .",
    "however , for a given exposure @xmath3 and a given outcome  @xmath4 , there will be multiple causal diagrams that correctly represent the causal structure relating these variables to one another and to covariates .",
    "one diagram may be an elaboration of another and contain variables that the other does not .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that if a variable @xmath0 is classified as a confounder under definitions  [ def1 ] ,  [ def2 ] ,  [ def4 ] ,  [ def5 ] or  [ def6 ] , then @xmath0 will also be a confounder under each of those definitions respectively on any expanded causal diagram with additional variables . in the case of definition  [ def1 ] , this is because associations that hold conditional on covariates @xmath1 for one diagram will clearly also hold for the other . in the case of definition  [ def2 ]",
    ", if @xmath0 blocks a backdoor path on one causal diagram , it will block a backdoor path on any larger diagram that also correctly describes the causal structure .",
    "in the case of definition  [ def4 ] , if there is some minimally sufficient adjustment set @xmath5 of which @xmath0 is a member , then that set will also be minimally sufficient on any larger diagram that also correctly describes the causal structure . in the case of definitions  [ def5 ] and  [ def6 ] ,",
    "if the inequalities in these definitions hold for some covariate set @xmath1 for one diagram , they will clearly also hold for the other .",
    "only definition  [ def3 ] does not share this property . to see this , consider figure  [ fig3 ] ; if in figure  [ fig3 ] , we collapsed over @xmath44 so that the causal diagram involved only @xmath43 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , then @xmath43 would be a member of every minimally sufficient adjustment set for this diagram and thus a confounder under definition  [ def3 ] .",
    "however , as we saw above , @xmath43 is not a confounder under definition  [ def3 ] for figure  [ fig3 ] itself which includes the extra variable @xmath44 .",
    "this failure is a serious problem with definition  [ def3 ] , but , as we also saw above , definition  [ def3 ] suffers from other limitations as well .",
    "several fairly trivial implications follow from definition  [ def4 ] and may be worth noting for the sake of completeness . first",
    ", if a causal diagram had a variable @xmath0 with an arrow to @xmath103 ( or vice versa ) and if @xmath0 were a member of a minimally sufficient adjustment set , then , under definition  [ def4 ] , both @xmath0 and @xmath103 would be considered `` confounders , '' though @xmath103 would not be a confounder conditional on @xmath0 , and likewise @xmath0 would not be a confounder conditional on @xmath103 .",
    "we believe that this is in accord with epidemiologic usage , though it would be peculiar to consider both @xmath0 and @xmath103 simultaneously , just as it would be peculiar to include both @xmath0 and @xmath103 on a causal diagram .",
    "second , if a variable @xmath0 is measured with error , taking value @xmath104 , and if the measurement error term @xmath105 were also represented on the causal diagram , then , if @xmath0 were a confounder under definition  [ def4 ] , @xmath104 and @xmath106 would also both be confounders under definition  [ def4 ] .",
    "we believe this is also in accord with standard epidemiologic usage of `` confounder , '' though we would in practice rarely refer to @xmath106 as a `` confounder '' since we rarely have access to  @xmath106 . once again , however , neither @xmath104 nor @xmath106 would be confounders conditional on  @xmath0 .",

    "this is because if @xmath5 denotes the set of all nodes @xmath0 which obey property  [ prope2a ] and if @xmath5 is not a sufficient adjustment set ( so there is open backdoor path @xmath40 from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) , then if we let @xmath73 be all nondescendants of @xmath3 other than @xmath3 and noncolliders nodes on @xmath40 , if we choose a node @xmath113 on @xmath40 that does not contain descendants of @xmath114 then it is the case that @xmath113 satisfies property  [ prope2a ] , and is not a part of @xmath5 , which would be a contradiction .",
    "although it is the case that if property  [ prope2a ] is itself taken as the definition of a confounder then this definition also satisfies property  [ prope1 ] on causal diagrams , this does not hold generally within a counterfactual framework .",
    "note also that , even on causal diagrams , it is not the case that property  [ prope2a ] implies property  [ prope1 ] ; a counterexample to this was given in proposition  [ prop3 ] for definition  [ def3 ] which satisfies property  [ prope2a ] but not property  [ prope1 ] .",
    "rather , if property  [ prope2a ] is itself taken as the definition of a confounder , then , on causal diagrams , this definition would satisfy property  [ prope1 ] as well .",
    "this raises the question as to whether property  [ prope2a ] itself could be taken as the definition of a confounder , as such a definition would satisfy property  [ prope2a ] ( by definition ) and property  [ prope1 ] on causal diagrams .",
    "although such a definition would satisfy properties  [ prope1 ] and  [ prope2a ] on causal diagrams , it would also follow from this definition that @xmath43 is a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 in figure  [ fig1 ] , even though the effect @xmath3 on @xmath4 is unconfounded without controlling for any covariates .",
    "this is because if property  [ prope2a ] is taken as the definition of a confounder , then @xmath43 satisfies property  [ prope2a ] with @xmath1 taken as @xmath42 . in general , however , if the effect @xmath3 on @xmath4 is unconfounded without controlling for any covariates , we would probably simply say that there are no confounders for the unconditional effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 .",
    "the causal inference literature has provided a formal definition of confounding with reference to distributions of counterfactual outcomes .",
    "the literature now rightly emphasizes the concept of confounding control over that of a `` confounder . ''",
    "nonetheless , the word `` confounder '' is often still used among applied researchers and in this paper we have shown that at least one formal counterfactual - based definition coheres with the way in which the word is generally used .",
    "we have considered a number of candidate proposals often arising from more informal statements made in the literature .",
    "we have considered whether each of these definitions satisfies two properties , namely , ( i ) that on any causal diagram , control for all confounders so defined will control for confounding and ( ii ) any variable qualifying as a confounder under this criterion will in some context remove confounding .",
    "only one of the definitions considered here satisfied both of these two properties .",
    "we thus proposed that a pre - exposure covariate @xmath0 be considered a confounder for the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 if there exists a set of covariates @xmath1 such that the effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded conditional on @xmath2 but for no proper subset of @xmath2 is the effect of the exposure on the outcome unconfounded given the subset .",
    "equivalently , a confounder is a `` member of a minimally sufficient adjustment set . ''",
    "this is closely related to the definitions concerning confounders given in @xcite , though robins and morgenstern suggest specifying the other variables for which control might be made as well .",
    "we have further provided a conditional analogue of the proposed definition of a confounder ; and we have proposed that a variable that helps reduce bias but not eliminate bias be referred to as a `` surrogate confounder . ''",
    "the definition of a `` confounder '' above is given rigorously in terms of counterfactuals and , we believe , is also in accord with the intuitive properties of a `` confounder '' implicitly presupposed by practicing statisticians and epidemiologists . from a more theoretical perspective , definition  [ def4 ] , unlike the other definitions , gives rise to elegant and useful results which itself lends further support for its being taken as the definition of a confounder .",
    "a directed graph consists of a set of nodes and directed edges among nodes .",
    "a path is a sequence of distinct nodes connected by edges regardless of arrowhead direction ; a directed path is a path which follows the edges in the direction indicated by the graph s arrows .",
    "a directed graph is acyclic if there is no node with a sequence of directed edges back to itself .",
    "the nodes with directed edges into a node @xmath3 are said to be the parents of @xmath3 ; the nodes into which there are directed edges from @xmath3 are said to be the children of @xmath3 .",
    "we say that node @xmath3 is an ancestor of node @xmath115 if there is a directed path from @xmath3 to @xmath115 ; if @xmath3 is an ancestor of @xmath115 , then @xmath115 is said to be a descendant of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath1 denotes a set of nodes , then @xmath116 will denote the ancestors of @xmath1 and @xmath117 will denote the set of nondescendants of @xmath1 . for a given graph @xmath12 , and a set of nodes @xmath5 , the graph @xmath118 denotes a subgraph of @xmath12 containing only vertices of @xmath12 in @xmath5 and only edges of @xmath12 between vertices in @xmath5 . on the other hand , the graph @xmath119 denotes the graph obtained from @xmath120 by removing all edges with arrowheads pointing to @xmath5 .",
    "a node is said to be a collider for a particular path if it is such that both the preceding and subsequent nodes on the path have directed edges going into that node .",
    "a path between two nodes , @xmath3 and @xmath115 , is said to be blocked given some set of nodes @xmath0 if either there is a variable in @xmath0 on the path that is not a collider for the path or if there is a collider on the path such that neither the collider itself nor any of its descendants are in @xmath0 . for disjoint sets of nodes @xmath121 , @xmath115 and @xmath0 , we say that @xmath3 and @xmath115 are d - separated given @xmath0 if every path from any node in @xmath3 to any node in @xmath115 is blocked given @xmath0 .",
    "directed acyclic graphs are sometimes used as statistical models to encode independence relationships among variables represented by the nodes on the graph [ lauritzen ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "the variables corresponding to the nodes on a graph are said to satisfy the global markov property for the directed acyclic graph ( or to have a distribution compatible with the graph ) if for any disjoint sets of nodes @xmath122 we have that @xmath123 whenever @xmath3 and @xmath115 are d - separated given @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of some set of variables @xmath124 on the graph is said to be faithful to the graph if for all disjoint sets @xmath122 of @xmath124 we have that @xmath123 only when @xmath3 and @xmath115 are d - separated given @xmath0 .",
    "directed acyclic graphs can be interpreted as representing causal relationships .",
    "@xcite defined a causal directed acyclic graph as a directed acyclic graph with nodes @xmath125 corresponding to variables such that each variable @xmath18 is given by its nonparametric structural equation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 are the parents of @xmath18 on the graph and the @xmath21 are mutually independent . for a causal diagram ,",
    "the nonparametric structural equations encode counterfactual relationships among the variables represented on the graph .",
    "the equations themselves represent one - step ahead counterfactuals with other counterfactuals given by recursive substitution [ see @xcite for further discussion ] .",
    "a causal directed acyclic graph defined by nonparametric structural equations satisfies the global markov property as stated above [ @xcite ] .",
    "the requirement that the @xmath21 be mutually independent is essentially a requirement that there is no variable absent from the graph which , if included on the graph , would be a parent of two or more variables [ pearl ( @xcite , @xcite ) ] . throughout",
    "we assume the exposure @xmath3 consists of a single node .",
    "a backdoor path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 is a path to @xmath4 which begins with an edge into @xmath3 .",
    "a set of variables @xmath1 is said to satisfy the backdoor path criterion with respect to @xmath61 if no variable in @xmath1 is a descendant of @xmath3 and if @xmath1 blocks all backdoor paths from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite showed that if @xmath1 satisfies the backdoor path criterion with respect to @xmath61 , then the effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 is unconfounded given @xmath1 , that is , @xmath126 .",
    "the absence of confounding conditional on a set of covariates @xmath5 , that is , @xmath13 , is not a property that can be tested empirically with data .",
    "one must rely on subject matter knowledge , which may sometimes take the form of a causal diagram .",
    "nonetheless , a  few things can be said about empirical testing concerning confounding and confounders . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we will consider each of definitions  [ def1][def6 ] .",
    "it is possible to verify empirically whether a variable is a confounder under definition  [ def1 ] since the definition refers to observed associations ; however , it is not possible , without further knowledge , to empirically verify that a variable does not satisfy definition  [ def1 ] because a variable may satisfy definition  [ def1 ] for some @xmath1 that involves an unmeasured variable @xmath127 .",
    "one would have to know that data were available for all variables on a causal diagram to empirically verify that a variable was a nonconfounder under definition  [ def1 ] .",
    "because of this , even though definition  [ def1 ] satisfies property  [ prope1 ] under faithfulness , this can not be used as an empirical test for confounding since ( i ) we can not empirically verify that a variable is a nonconfounder under definition  [ def1 ] and ( ii ) we can not empirically verify whether faithfulness holds .    without further assumptions , we can not empirically verify that a variable is a confounder or a nonconfounder under definition  [ def2 ] because definition  [ def2 ] makes reference to backdoor paths .",
    "whether a variable lies on a backdoor path can not be tested empirically without further assumptions ; one would have to know the structure of the underlying causal diagram .",
    "likewise , for definitions  [ def3 ] and  [ def4 ] , one would need to know all minimally sufficient adjustment sets , which itself would require checking the `` no confounding '' condition @xmath13 , which is , as noted above , not empirically testable ; though see below for some qualifications . for definition  [ def5 ]",
    ", we could empirically reject the inequality in definition  [ def5 ] for observed @xmath1 if @xmath128 .",
    "however , we can not empirically reject the inequality in definition  [ def5 ] for unobserved @xmath1 and we , moreover , can not empirically verify the inequality in definition  [ def5 ] because @xmath8 will not in general be empirically identified if there are unobserved variables .",
    "we can verify empirically whether a variable is a confounder under definition  [ def6 ] since the definition refers to only observed variables ; however , it is not possible , without further knowledge , to empirically verify that a variable does not satisfy definition  [ def6 ] because a variable may satisfy definition  [ def6 ] for some @xmath1 that involves an unmeasured variable  @xmath127 .",
    "one would have to know that data were available for all variables on a causal diagram to empirically verify that a variable was a nonconfounder under definition  [ def6 ] .",
    "because of this we can not empirically verify that a variable is a nonconfounder under definition  [ def6 ] .",
    "determining whether a variable is a confounder requires making untestable assumptions .",
    "the only real progress that can be made with empirical testing for confounders is by making other untestable assumptions that logically imply a test for assumptions we care about .",
    "for example , suppose we assume we have some set @xmath5 that we are sure constitutes a sufficient adjustment set . in this case , we can sometimes remove variables as unnecessary for confounding control . in particular",
    ", @xcite showed that if we knew that for covariate sets @xmath129 and @xmath130 we had that @xmath131 , then we would also have that @xmath132 if @xmath130 can be decomposed into two disjoint subsets @xmath133 and @xmath134 such that @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "both of these latter conditions are empirically testable .",
    "@xcite provide some analogous results for the effect of exposure on the exposed .",
    "@xcite note that if for covariate set @xmath5 we have that @xmath13 , then if a backward selection procedure is applied to @xmath5 such that variables are iteratively discarded that are independent of @xmath4 conditional on both exposure @xmath3 and the members of @xmath5 that have not yet been discarded , then the resulting set of covariates will suffice for confounding control .",
    "they also show that under an additional assumption of faithfulness , if , for covariate set @xmath5 , we have that @xmath13 , then if a forward selection procedure is applied to @xmath5 such that , starting with the empty set , variables are iteratively added which are associated with @xmath4 conditional on both exposure @xmath3 and the variables that have already been added , then the resulting set of covariates will suffice for confounding control .",
