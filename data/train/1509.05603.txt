    "it is interesting to see that , as the helicity - flip terms , the theoretical calculations from the loop contributions to @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) indeed result in the values to be one order of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath107 , which can be safely neglected . in the double - pole momentum dependences , @xmath108 and @xmath109",

    "the more precise measurement of this ratio in the future will test the validity of the symmetries . as @xmath138 , we emphasize that more experimental searches should be done for the two - body @xmath40 decays , while most of the recent observations are from the @xmath39 decays .",
    "since @xmath139 results from the @xmath79 flavor and @xmath80 spin symmetries as well as the heavy flavor symmetry , its non - zero measurement will imply for the broken symmetry . through the @xmath140 transition at the quark level , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 with @xmath56 and @xmath7 are all @xmath144 as shown in the right - bottom of table  [ table1 ] .",
    "in contrast , the neutral @xmath145 modes via the @xmath146 transition have the branching ratios of order @xmath147 caused by the suppression of @xmath148 .",
