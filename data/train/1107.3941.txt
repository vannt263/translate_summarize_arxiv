    "phenomena occurring in the interaction of matter with intense , low - frequency laser fields , such as high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) , above - threshold ionization ( ati ) , and laser - induced nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) , owe their existence to laser - induced recombination or rescattering processes , in which a previously released electron interacts with its parent ion @xcite .",
    "the identification of their common dynamical origin has been instrumental to exploit these effects in a number of applications , such as for the generation of attosecond pulses @xcite and the dynamic imaging of matter with subfemtosecond precision @xcite . since this mechanism",
    "is intimately linked to specific dynamical pathways , it also led to efficient semi - analytical approaches , such as the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) ( for seminal work on ionization and laser induced rescattering see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) . in this approach",
    ", the quantum - mechanical transition amplitude is associated to the orbits of an electron returning to its parent ion .",
    "the transition amplitude corresponding to a particular strong - field process takes the form of a multiple integral , which , in many cases , can be solved employing saddle - point methods @xcite .",
    "it is also a well - known fact that the orbits along which the active electron returns typically occur in pairs .",
    "in particular , thresholds can often be associated to conditions where the two orbits of a given pair become almost degenerate .",
    "this violates the saddle - point assumption which leads to expressions in terms of individual orbits , but can be treated successfully in a uniform approximation which describes the two orbits collectively @xcite .",
    "this approximation has been first applied in strong - field physics to ati @xcite and , since then , has been used in a wide range of phenomena , such as hhg @xcite and nsdi @xcite .",
    "this latter phenomenon is a typical example of a highly correlated two - electron process occurring in strong laser fields .",
    "the physical mechanism behind it is a three - step process in which the first electron is released in the continuum by tunneling or multiphoton ionization , and gains kinetic energy from the field .",
    "subsequently , it is driven back by the field towards its parent ion , with which it rescatters . in this",
    "recollision , part of its kinetic energy is transferred to the core , so that a second electron is freed .",
    "there are several pathways through which nsdi may occur .",
    "both electrons may , for instance , be released simultaneously in a scattering process in which the first electron , upon return , provides the second electron with enough energy for it to overcome the second ionization potential .",
    "this process is known as electron - impact ionization .",
    "this pathway has been successfully used to explain a number of experimentally observed features in the electron momentum distribution , such as peaks at non - vanishing momenta @xcite , and the recently observed v - shaped structure which can been associated to the long - range electron - electron repulsion @xcite .",
    "apart from that , the second electron may be released in a time delayed pathway , in which the first electron promotes the second electron to an excited bound state .",
    "near the subsequent field maximum , the second electron tunnels from this excited state .",
    "these pathways are becoming increasingly important for two main reasons , which are directly related to attosecond - imaging applications .",
    "first , the complexity of studied nsdi targets is systematically increasing , and with this internal excitations become more important .",
    "second , delayed pathways govern the below - threshold regime , for which the driving - field intensities are too low for the second electron to leave by direct ionization @xcite .",
    "these time - delayed pathways are far less understood @xcite .",
    "besides an overall controversy relating to the physical mechanisms behind them ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a detailed discussion of this topic ) , they can pose a fundamental problem associated to causality , which we address in the present work .",
    "a particularly relevant time - delayed pathway in nsdi is the ",
    "recollision with subsequent tunneling ionization \" ( resi ) . in previous work",
    "@xcite it has been shown that this pathway can be understood as a rescattered ati - like process for the first electron , followed by direct ati for the second electron .",
    "resi is a non - standard case within strong - field physics , as the uniform approximation mentioned above requires some modifications .",
    "in fact , a rigorous treatment of resi within a saddle - point framework is a non - trivial problem as the rescattering of the first electron must precede the ionization time of the second electron .",
    "so far , this issue has been analyzed mainly in a classical framework , for which both times are real and thus can be ordered . in the sfa , however , the associated orbits have complex ionization times , which are required to account for the non - classical effect of tunneling .    in this work",
    ", we address this complication of casuality for complex times and investigate how it affects the momentum distributions in the resi pathway of nsdi .",
    "we approach the problem from the perspective of asymptotic expansions , and resolve it by explicit construction of steepest - descent integration contours .",
    "the consequences of causality become apparent when one contrasts the case of a purely monochromatic ( and hence infinitely long ) driving field to the more realistic scenario of few - cycle driving pulses .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sfa ] we briefly recall the expression for the resi transition amplitude and discuss the saddle point trajectories with complex rescattering and ionization times . in sec .",

    "in this work we performed a detailed analysis of the recollision with subsequent tunneling ionization ( resi ) mechanism in laser - induced nonsequential ionization ( nsdi ) , with emphasis on the implications of causality .",
    "physically , resi means that the first electron rescatters with the core at an instant @xmath0 and excites a second electron , which tunnel ionizes at a subsequent time @xmath1 .",
    "causality means that tunnel ionization of the second electron can only occur after the recollision of the first electron .",
    "applying the saddle point approximation to the strong - field expressions , the rescattering and ionization times become complex ( since tunneling does not have a classical counterpart ) , and the notion of causality has to be generalized into the complex time plane .",
    "we have shown that the concepts of  before \" and  after \" translate into boundary conditions limiting the steepest - descent contours to be taken .",
    "these boundary conditions are given by the complex rescattering times of the first electron .",
    "ionization times of the second electron are casually connected to a rescattering event if it lies on a steepest descent contour that connects the rescattering time to the distant future . in practice",
    ", this often translates into a simple rule where only the real parts of the complex times have to be compared .",
    "deviations have been observed , however , for pairs of electron orbits associated with the trailing edge of the pulse , or for momentum regions in which the resi yield is strongly suppressed .",
    "we illustrated the influence of causality and quantum - interference on momentum - resolved two - electron distributions . in order to isolated these effects ,",
    "we compared distributions for a monochromatic driving field to those for a few - cycle pulse .",
    "while causality does not affect the electron momentum distributions obtained for monochromatic fields , it significantly affects the results for a few - cycle pulse . for these pulses , there exist several competing sets of orbits , whose dominance influences the shapes of the electron momentum distributions , which generally are highly asymmetric and concentrated in specific momentum regions .",
    "causality puts constraints on the construction of two - electron trajectories , which drastically changes the momentum regions populated by the distributions .",
    "causality may have consequences even for monochromatic driving when it is combined with additional effects , such as bound - state depletion .",
    "depending on the laser - field intensity and the binding energy of the excited state , such depletion can be considerable , and if this is the case the ionization time @xmath1 lying closest in the future of the rescattering time @xmath13 is expected to contribute most .",

    "<S> we perform a detailed analysis of the importance of causality within the strong - field approximation and the steepest descent framework for the recollision - excitation with subsequent tunneling ionization ( resi ) pathway in laser - induced nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) . in this time - delayed pathway </S>",
    "<S> , an electron returns to its parent ion , and , by recolliding with the core , gives part of its kinetic energy to excite a second electron at a time @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the second electron then reaches the continuum at a later time @xmath1 by tunneling ionization . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are complex , the condition that recollision of the first electron occurs before tunnel ionization of the second electron translates into boundary conditions for the steepest - descent contours , and thus puts constraints on the saddles to be taken when computing the resi transition amplitudes . we also show that this generalized causality condition has a dramatic effect in the shapes of the resi electron momentum distributions for few - cycle laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> physically , causality determines how the dominant sets of orbits an electron returning to its parent ion can be combined with the dominant orbits of a second electron tunneling from an excited state . </S>",
    "<S> all features encountered are analyzed in terms of such orbits , and their quantum interference . </S>"
