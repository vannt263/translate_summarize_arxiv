    "it is well known that summation over spacetime topologies is an important part of euclidean quantum gravity ( eqg )  the concept underlying the theory of initial conditions in quantum cosmology @xcite and physics of baby universes @xcite .",
    "the latter in its turn used to underlie the old mechanism of vanishing cosmological constant and big fix of fundamental constants of nature @xcite .",
    "eqg interpreted as a fundamental theory a priori admits this summation and the corresponding topological transitions . on the other hand , in the lorentzian signature spacetime temporal evolution with changing topology of spatial slices was demonstrated to be inconsistent in view of back reaction of infinitely intensive flashes of matter radiation emanating from the relevant spacetime bifurcation points @xcite .",
    "in contrast to lorentzian theory eqg is more flexible to accommodate various topologies , and except certain geometrical and kinematical restrictions ( see for example @xcite ) it does not seem to contain dynamical mechanisms suppressing topological transitions . nevertheless , there exists a counterexample to this statement  it was recently demonstrated @xcite that the eqg path integral for the microcanonical statistical sum in cosmology can suppress the contribution of instantons with the topology of the hartle - hawking no - boundary configurations @xcite .",
    "this happens for the cosmological model driven by conformal field theory ( cft )  quantum matter conformally coupled to gravity .",
    "this model is interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , in view of suppression of the above type it eliminates a very anti - intuitive situation when infinitely large universes with a vanishing effective hubble factor @xmath0 are infinitely more probable than the universes with a finite @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is the situation with the hartle - hawking instantons having a _ negative _ action inverse proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "second , when properly modified ( with the primordial cosmological constant @xmath3 replaced by a composite field decaying in the slow roll regime ) this model can generate inflation @xcite . and finally , as was noticed in @xcite the cft driven cosmology provides perhaps the first example of the initial quantum state of the inflationary universe , which has a thermal nature of the primordial power spectrum of cosmological perturbations .",
    "this suggests a new mechanism for the red tilt of the cmb anisotropy , complementary to the conventional mechanism which is based on a small deviation of the inflationary expansion from the exact de sitter evolution @xcite .",
    "simple estimates show that the thermal imprint of this initial state can constitute a considerable or even dominant part of this red tilt .",
    "it is currently getting measured by planck with ever growing precision at the pivotal wavelength scale @xmath4 500 mpc .",
    "therefore , potentially this cft model can be applied for experimental verification of the relative vacuum and thermal components of the red cmb spectrum at subhorizon scales .    in this paper",
    "we show that the suppression mechanism for topological configurations of the hartle - hawking type , which was found in the cft driven cosmology , is much more general and , in fact , applies to all quantum fields independently of their conformal properties .",
    "though this mechanism is realized within the eqg formalism , its origin can be traced back to the physical setting in the lorentzian spacetime .",
    "eqg formalism derived from the lorentzian theory inherits the arrow of time which , in its turn , enforces certain junction conditions for quantum fields at the points of bifurcating topology .",
    "these junction conditions infinitely suppress the contribution of such topologies within the one - loop approximation for the eqg path integral .",
    "for local boson fields this suppression follows from their ultraviolet ( uv ) behavior , while for fermions it turns out to be a direct consequence of the pauli principle .    pinching procedure for a segment of @xmath5 spacetime between two closed hypersurfaces @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the @xmath8 topology .",
    "the intermediate @xmath8 section contracts to a point which becomes a regular internal point of each of the two smooth disconnected parts.,width=302 ]    the organization of the paper is as follows . in sect.2 we recapitulate the suggestions of the work @xcite  using as a first principle canonical quantization of gravity in the lorentzian signature spacetime we derive the euclidean path integral representation for the statistical sum of the microcanonical ensemble in cosmology .",
    "cosmology is supposed to be closed with spatial sections of the @xmath8 topology , and the eqg path integration runs over periodic configurations with the topology of @xmath5 . in the limiting case these configuarations also include the topology of @xmath9 .",
    "the latter can be viewed as the result of contracting the @xmath8 section of @xmath5 to a zero size  a point  at @xmath10 different locations on @xmath11 .",
    "this contraction or pinching procedure explains the class of topological transitions we are going to consider here . in more general terms they can be described as taking the connected patch of a manifold ( say , between the @xmath8-surfaces @xmath6 and @xmath7 as depicted on fig.[fig.3 ] ) and pinching it at some point in such a way that it gets disconnected into two parts , this pinching point becoming _ a regular internal point _ of each of these parts .",
    "a similar transition leading to multiple spheres configurations is depicted on fig.[fig.3a ] for @xmath12 pinching points .",
    "important remark is that such a euclidean manifold inherits from the lorentzian setup a distinguished arrow of time ( or , better to say , directionless axis of time ",
    "it acquires direction only after continuation to the lorentzian spacetime which nucleates from the euclidean space at minimal surfaces ) .",
    "this arrow of time does not only implement periodicity on the circle @xmath11 of @xmath5 , but also remains built in every @xmath13 of @xmath9 because it runs through the sequence of the pinching points of the above type .",
    "though it is hard to implement explicitly the regularity of such pinching points in the eqg path integration , this property can be observed in the saddle points of the path integral .",
    "this is done in sects.3 and 4 where according to @xcite the semiclassical calculation of the statistical sum is applied to the cft driven cosmology .",
    "it is shown that the no - boundary instantons of the hartle - hawking type originate in this model by such a pinching procedure , but their contribution is dynamically suppressed to zero due to the effect of the conformal anomaly of quantum fields .",
    "it is shown , in particular , that this suppression is an artifact of special junction conditions for quantum fields , which in their turn are enforced by the arrow of time inherited from the lorentzian theory .",
    "in sect.5 we show that the suppression of topology transitions goes beyond cft models and holds in the one - loop approximation for generic local boson and fermion fields as a general consequence of these junction conditions . in sect.6",
    "we discuss the problem of equivalence of different dynamical mechanisms of topology change suppression , its extension beyond one - loop order and a number of related issues .",

    "the physical setting in lorentzian signature spacetime starts with the definition of the microcanonical ensemble in canonically quantized gravity theory .",
    "in cosmology the corresponding density matrix @xmath14 was suggested in @xcite as a formal projector @xmath15 on the subspace of physical states satisfying the system of the wheeler - dewitt equations @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the operator realization of the full set of the gravitational hamiltonian and momentum constraints @xmath18 .",

    "the justification for ( [ projector ] ) as the density matrix of a _ microcanonical _ ensemble in spatially closed cosmology was put forward in @xcite based on the analogy with an unconstrained system having a conserved hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "the microcanonical state with a fixed energy @xmath28 for such a system is given by the density matrix @xmath29 .",
    "a major distinction of ( [ projector ] ) from this case is that spatially closed cosmology does not have freely specifiable constants of motion like the energy or other global charges .",
    "rather it has as constants of motion the hamiltonian and momentum constraints @xmath30 , all having a particular value  zero .",
    "therefore , the expression ( [ projector ] ) can be considered as the analogue of equipartition  a natural candidate for the microcanonical quantum state of the _ closed _ universe .",
    "the definition ( [ projector ] ) has , of course , a very formal nature because it is very incomplete in view of non - commutativity of the constraints @xmath17 , infinite dimensional ( and continuous ) nature of the space of indices @xmath19 and the phase space , etc .",
    "however , at the semiclassical level ( within the perturbation loop expansion ) the kernel of this projector can be written down as a faddeev - popov gauge - fixed path integral of the canonically quantized gravity theory @xcite @xmath31\\ ;      \\exp\\left[\\,i\\ !",

    "might seem contradictory because equipartition over entire physical space , not restricted by a fixed value of some observable like energy , is likely to result in divergent statistical sum and expectation values .",
    "however , the path integral representation ( [ rhocanonical ] ) treated within @xmath38-expansion implies projection onto perturbative solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equations ( [ wdw ] ) , which have a semiclassical limit .",

    "one more notational step consists in the observation that this lorentzian metric can be viewed as the euclidean metric @xmath43 with the imaginary value of the euclidean lapse function @xmath44 , @xmath45 so that the euclidean theory action is related to the original lorentzian action @xmath46 $ ] by a typical equation @xmath47      = -s[\\,g_{\\mu\\nu},\\phi\\ , ] .",

    "this topology of the spacetime bulk interpolating between the hypersurfaces @xmath6 and @xmath7 reflects the mixed nature of the density matrix and establishes entanglement correlations between @xmath25 and @xmath53 @xcite .",

    "below we will see that this interpretation is not quite precise .",
    "while this interpretation seems correct in the tree - level approximation , beyond it quantum fluctuations destroy pure state coherence and , in fact , suppress to zero the contribution of these nontrivial topologies .",
    "additional remark is that pinching the spacetime between @xmath6 and @xmath7 can take place several times @xmath54 , and the picture of fig.[fig.3 ] should be modified accordingly .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath55 in ( [ rho ] ) follows from the density matrix normalization @xmath56 and determines the main object of interest  the statistical sum of the model .",

    "has the same sign as that of bosons , so that all particles participate on equal footing in the conformal mechanism of topology change suppression .",
    "this is another indication to the discrepancy between the mechanisms of this suppression .",
    "the source of this discrepancy remains unclear and deserves further study .",
    "there are several other issues for future research . to begin with",
    ", our mechanism works only in the one - loop approximation , and the extension to multi - loop orders can relax it or destroy its universality .",
    "there is a hope , however , that for fermion fields it will still hold due to pauli principle .",
    "fortunately , the prediction of the cft cosmology with a large number of conformal species @xmath197 belongs to semiclassical domain @xcite , and the effect of higher order loops is unlikely to change the situation .",
    "also , irrespective of the topological context , it would be interesting to consider a similar effect of junction conditions in lorentzian spacetime .",
    "the analogue of the points @xmath148 of eq .",
    "( [ suppression ] ) in the lorentzian de sitter spacetime are antipodal points at which the green s function @xmath165 is singular for a whole family of de sitter invariant vacua @xcite .",
    "therefore , cancelation of singularities is possible in the combination @xmath198 .",
    "this makes the suppression effect depending on the vacuum choice and might lead to new selection rules for antipodal identifications of de sitter and black hole spacetimes @xcite .",
    "conceptually , it is important that for local boson fields the suppression effect is mediated by their uv behavior .",
    "nevertheless , this effect can not be excluded by uv renormalization , because it would require a point - like counterterm localized at the junction point of the topological transition .",
    "introduction of such counterterms would be unnatural , because they would not correspond to any type of renormalization , and their localization can be ascribed only to special regular points emerging in the solutions of effective equations in a way described above in sect.4 .",
    "this situation is different from boundary counterterms which arise in models with branes of various codimensionalities and boundaries .",
    "these counterterms are also defined on subspaces of a lower dimensionality , but they occur as a part of physical setting  specification of an initial quantum state on a cauchy surface or the brane action on timelike world sheets of the branes @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that dynamical suppression we suggest applies only to a limited class of topological transitions of figs.[fig.3 ] and [ fig.3a ] . it does not include suppression of topologies with handles which imply changing the topology of 3-dimensional sections and creation of baby universes in the spirit of @xcite . from the viewpoint of lorentzian theory , underlying the eqg formalism ,",
    "such topology changes are kinematically forbidden , because our starting point ",
    "the microcanonical density matrix ( [ projector ] )  in our physical setting is simply unaware of the concept of time and evolution .",
    "it only knows a fixed topology of a 3-dimensional space ( chosen above as @xmath8 )  the range of the continuous coordinate label @xmath199 in the condensed index @xmath200 of the set of quantum constraints @xmath17 .",
    "this happens due to spatially closed nature of our model in which the total hamiltonian reduces to the linear combination of constraints . as a result ,",
    "the time parameter @xmath35 arises only as an operator ordering label which helps to resolve the noncommutative algebra of @xmath17 in ( [ projector ] ) in the form of the canonical path integral @xcite .",
    "this construction of the density matrix ( [ rhocanonical ] ) at the kinematical level leaves us with the only set of topological transitions of the pinching type , shown on figs.[fig.3 ] and [ fig.3a ] . in view of continuity of integration histories",
    "this enforces the junction conditions ( [ junction ] ) at the pinching points .",
    "then , as a consequence a dynamical mechanism of topology suppression enters the game and excludes vacuum configurations from the statistical sum .",
    "of course , one can adopt a less conservative standpoint and regard eqg as a fundamental first principle of the theory in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "then path integration includes disconnected topologies without any junction conditions for quantum fields , which will restore the contribution of no - boundary instantons with finite nonvanishing one - loop prefactors .",
    "this would lead to two families of multiple sphere de sitter instantons @xmath9 with the hubble factors ( [ hpm ] ) and all known difficulties associated with their negative on - shell action @xmath201 .",
    "this is the infrared catastrophe of @xmath202 and divergent contribution of @xmath116 configurations weighted by @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "they might perhaps be cured within the tunneling prescription for the cosmological wavefunction by inverting the sign of the action @xcite . though this prescription was recently endowed with the eqg path integral formulation and",

    "effectively this leads to flipping the sign of the action only for heavy massive quantum fields treated within gradient expansion .",
    "this effect does not work for massless conformal fields and also leaves unanswered certain subtle questions of analytic continuation @xcite . ]    altogether , this does not strengthen the status of eqg as a first principle concept and gives strong priority to topology suppression mechanisms rooted in lorentzian theory .",
    "this leaves us with the thermal quantum state for the primordial power spectrum of cosmological perturbations .",
