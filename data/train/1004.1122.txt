    "a majority of computational homogenization algorithms rely on the solution of the unit cell problem , which concerns the determination of local fields in a representative sample of a heterogeneous material under periodic boundary conditions . currently , the most efficient numerical solvers of this problem are based on discretization of integral equations . in the case of particulate composites with smooth",
    "bounded inclusions embedded in a matrix phase , the problem can be reduced to internal interfaces and solved with remarkable accuracy and efficiency by the fast multipole method , see  ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "an alternative method has been proposed by suquet and moulinec  @xcite to treat problems with general microstructures supplied in the form of digital images .",
    "the algorithm is based on the neumann series expansion of the inverse to an operator arising in the associated lippmann - schwinger equation and exploits the fast fourier transform  ( fft ) to evaluate the action of the operator efficiently .",
    "the major disadvantage of the fft - based method consists in its poor convergence for composites exhibiting large jumps in material coefficients . to overcome this difficulty , eyre and milton proposed in  @xcite an accelerated scheme derived from a modified integral equation treated by means of the series expansion approach .",
    "in addition , michel et al .",
    "@xcite introduced an equivalent saddle - point formulation solved by the augmented lagrangian method .",
    "as clearly demonstrated in a numerical study by moulinec and suquet  @xcite , both methods converge considerably faster than the original variant ; the number of iterations is proportional to the square root of the phase contrast instead of the linear increase for the basic scheme .",
    "however , this comes at the expense of increased computational cost per iteration and the sensitivity of the augmented lagrangian algorithm to the setting of its internal parameters .    in this short note",
    ", we introduce yet another approach to improve the convergence of the original fft - based scheme  @xcite based on the trigonometric collocation method  @xcite and its application to the helmholtz equation as introduced by vainikko  @xcite .",

    "in this section , we briefly summarize the essential steps of the trigonometric collocation - based solution to the unit cell problem by adapting the original exposition by vainikko  @xcite to the setting of electrical conduction in periodic composites . in what follows ,",

    "we consider a composite material represented by a periodic unit cell @xmath11 . in the context of linear electrostatics ,",

    "the field @xmath13 is subject to a constraint @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes a prescribed macroscopic electric field and @xmath19 represents the @xmath20-dimensional measure of @xmath14 .",
    "next , we introduce a homogeneous reference medium with constant conductivity @xmath21 , leading to a decomposition of the electric current field in the form @xmath22 the original problem   is then equivalent to the periodic lippmann - schwinger integral equation , formally written as @xmath23 where the @xmath24 operator is derived from the green s function of the problem   with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "a successful application of @xmath78 method to a generalized eshelby inhomogeneity problem has also been recently reported by novk  @xcite and kanaun  @xcite .",

    "the conductivity of the homogeneous reference medium is parameterized as @xmath85 where @xmath86 corresponds to the optimal convergence of @xmath87 algorithm  .",
    "all conjugate gradient - related results have been obtained using the implementations according to  @xcite and referred to as algorithm  6.18  ( @xmath78 method ) and algorithm  7.3  ( @xmath79 scheme ) .",
    "two termination criteria are considered .",
    "the first one is defined for the @xmath71-th iteration as  @xcite @xmath88 and provides the test of the equilibrium condition  @xmath57 in the fourier space .",
    "an alternative expression , related to the standard residual norm for iterative solvers , has been proposed by vinogradov and milton in  @xcite and admits the form @xmath89 with the additional @xmath90 term ensuring the proportionality to   at convergence . from the numerical point of view , the latter criterion is more efficient than the equilibrium variant , which requires additional operations per iteration . from the theoretical point of view , its usage is justified only when supported by a convergence result for the iterative algorithm . in the opposite case , the equilibrium norm appears to be more appropriate , in order to avoid spurious non - physical solutions .",
    "since no results for the optimal choice of the reference medium are known for @xmath91-based solvers , we first estimate their sensitivity to this aspect numerically .",
    "the results appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : example1a ] , plotting the relative number of iterations for @xmath78 and @xmath79 solvers against the conductivity of the reference medium parameterized by @xmath92 , recall  eq .  .       as expected , both @xmath78 and @xmath79 solvers achieve a significant improvement over @xmath87 method in terms of the number of iterations , ranging from @xmath80 for a mildly - contrasted composite down to @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , contrary to all other available methods , the number of iterations is almost independent of the choice of the reference medium .",
    "we also observe , in agreement with results by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  6.2 ) for the one - dimensional setting , that @xmath78 and @xmath79 algorithms generate identical sequences of iterates ; the minor differences visible for @xmath95 or @xmath94 can be therefore attributed to accumulation of round - off errors .",
    "these conclusions hold for both equilibrium- and residual - based norms , which appear to be roughly proportional for the considered range of the phase contrasts , cf .",
    "[ fig : example1b ] .",
    "therefore , the residual criterion   will mostly be used in what follows .     of @xmath78 and @xmath79",

    "[ fig : example1c ] , we supplement the comparison by considering the total cpu time required to achieve a convergence .",
    "the data indicate that the cost of one iteration is governed by the matrix - vector multiplication , recall  eq .",
    ": the overhead of @xmath78 scheme is about @xmath98 with respect to @xmath87  method , while the application of @xmath79 algorithm , which involves @xmath63 and @xmath68 products per iteration  @xcite , is about twice as demanding . as a result , cg algorithm significantly reduces the overall computational time in the whole range of contrasts , whereas a similar effect has been reported for the candidate schemes only for @xmath99 , cf .",
    "@xcite .      as confirmed by all previous works ,",
    "the phase contrast @xmath100  is the critical parameter influencing the convergence of fft - based iterative solvers . in  fig .",
    "[ fig : example2 ] , we compare the scaling of the total number of iterations with respect to phase contrast for cg and @xmath87 methods , respectively . the results clearly show that the number of iterations grows as @xmath101 instead of the linear increase for @xmath87 method .",
    "this follows from error bounds @xmath102 the first estimate was proven in  @xcite , whereas the second expression is a direct consequence of the condition number of matrix @xmath63 being proportional to @xmath100 and a well - known result for the conjugate gradient method , e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.11.3 ) .",
    "the cg - based method , however , failed to converge for the infinite contrast limit .",
    "such behavior is equivalent to the eyre - milton scheme  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , inferior to the augmented lagrangian algorithm , for which the convergence rate improves with increasing @xmath103 and the method converges even as @xmath104 .",

    "[ fig : example3b ] , plotted in the full logarithmic scale .",
    "for @xmath87 algorithm , two regimes can be clearly distinguished . in the first few iterations , the residual error rapidly decreases , but",
    "the iterates tend to deviate from equilibrium . then , both residuals are simultaneously reduced . for @xmath78 scheme",
    ", the increase of the equilibrium residual appears only in the first iteration and then the method rapidly converges to the correct solution .",
    "however , its convergence curve is irregular and",
    "the algorithm repeatedly stagnates in two consecutive iterations .",
    "further analysis of this phenomenon remains a subject of future work .",
    "in this short note , we have presented a conjugate gradient - based acceleration of the fft - based homogenization solver originally proposed by moulinec and suquet  @xcite and illustrated its performance on a problem of electric conduction in a periodic two - phase composite with isotropic phases .",
    "on the basis of obtained results , we conjecture that :    * the non - symmetric system of linear equations  , arising from discretization by the trigonometric collocation method  @xcite , can be solved using the standard conjugate gradient algorithm , * the convergence rate of the method is proportional to the square root of the phase contrast , * the methods fails to converge in the infinite contrast limit , * contrary to available improvements of the original fft - solver  @xcite , the cost of one iteration remains comparable to the basic scheme and the method is insensitive to the choice of auxiliary reference medium .",
    "the presented computational experiments provide the first step towards further improvements of the method , including a rigorous analysis of its convergence properties , acceleration by multi - grid solvers and preconditioning and the extension to non - linear problems .",
