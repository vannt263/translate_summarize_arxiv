    "however , @xcite recently showed that when density - enhanced dust shells are included in the chemical models , c@xmath0h is predicted to be present in a thick inner ring ( @xmath141 ) in addition to the outer ring at @xmath140 .",
    "rotational lines in the four new vibrational levels of c@xmath0h will most likely be observed in the inner envelope of irc+10216 , because that is where these higher lying levels will be most populated owing to the higher densities and temperatures closer to the star .",
    "although we did not find any evidence for lines of the new excited bending vibrational levels of c@xmath0h , it is plausible that the new vibrationally excited levels of c@xmath0h will be observed when millimeter - wave interferometers attain higher sensitivity now that we have established that c@xmath0h is present near the central star .    direct observations of hcch in the ir and hnc in the millimeter band ,",
    "provide a template for assigning and analyzing rotational spectra in vibrationally excited levels of c@xmath22h radicals among the many unassigned features recently observed in the inner envelope of irc+10216 with interferometers .",
    "these include : ( 1 ) a detailed analysis of the kinetic , vibrational , and rotational temperatures of hcch at @xmath142 derived from rotationally resolved vibrational lines in the @xmath143 m band @xcite ; ( 2 ) observations of hnc in the dust formation zone near 270  ghz with alma cycle  0 , and an accompanying detailed radiative transfer analysis @xcite ; and ( 3 ) a related observation of hcccn in the dense core of the protoplanetary nebula crl  618 with the sma in the 345  ghz band at @xmath144 from the central star where @xmath145  k @xcite .",
    "sample spectra obtained in alma cycle  0 with sixteen 16  m diam antennas and a @xmath20 synthesized beam in the @xmath146  ghz band @xcite are about 7 times more sensitive than those in the sma survey in the 345  ghz band @xcite .",
    "times greater with the sma .",
    "the synthesized beam in alma cycle  0 was 5 times smaller , but the diameter of the inner envelope ( @xmath147 ) is small with respect to the angular resolution in both observations . ] referring to figure  1 in @xcite , the peak flux densities of most of the unassigned narrow lines observed with alma ( @xmath148  jy / beam ) are below the detection limit with the sma .",
    "when alma attains full design sensitivity with 66  antennas it will be about 4 times more sensitive still , offering great promise for the identification of key reactive molecular intermediates such as the c@xmath22h radicals in the inner envelope of the prototypical carbon rich agb star irc+10216 , and elucidation of the chemical processes crucial to the formation of carbonaceous dust in the interstellar gas .",
