    "within the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) framework @xcite , the hadronic production of @xmath0 is dominated by the gluon fragmentation in which a gluon fragments into a color - octet state @xmath3 $ ] . and if the spin - symmetry hold for charm quarks , as is usually adopted in the literature , then the formed @xmath0 shall always show large transverse polarization at sufficiently large @xmath6 . but this prediction contradicts with the measured at tevatron @xcite . this is the well - known @xmath0 polarization puzzle .",

    ", we have found that without considering the spin - flip effect and by varying the involved matrix elements within the same uncertainty region derived by ref.@xcite , we can obtain the same allowable region for @xmath208 , i.e. @xmath221 $ ] .",
    "it is noted that the @xmath222 production is somewhat different from the case of @xmath0 and @xmath18 .",
    "ref.@xcite shows that the nlo correction plus the lo results for the color - singlet of @xmath222 can explain both the total unpolarized and the polarized @xmath222 production cross sections .",
    "then there is no need to consider the contributions from the color - octet transitions for @xmath222 production , or in another words , the color - octet components give negligible contributions to the @xmath222 production . for the @xmath0 or @xmath18 production , the nlo correction plus the lo results for the color - singlet production can also lead to longitudinal polarized @xmath0 or @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , it is well - known that with the color - singlet contribution only , one can not explain the unpolarized @xmath0 or @xmath18 production cross section . and",
    "by taking the color - octet @xmath223 components into consideration , one can well explain the total unpolarized cross section of @xmath0 or @xmath18 @xcite , which is regarded as a great triumph of nrqcd . within the nrqcd framework , if keeping the spin symmetry for the charm quark , refs.@xcite show that the @xmath0 polarization puzzle can not be solved even by including the nlo corrections .",
    "hence to well explain both the unpolarized and longitudinal cross sections of @xmath0 or @xmath18 is much more involved than the case of @xmath222 .    we have shown that the spin - flip interaction can have a significant impact on the transition of a color - octet @xmath78 @xmath223 pair into @xmath0 .",
    "such impact can be parameterized by introducing new parameters in the transition matrix @xmath224 , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "if the heavy quark spin symmetry holds , the matrix has only one parameter @xmath127 .",
    "the newly introduced parameters @xmath4 and @xmath19 are power suppressed in comparison to that of @xmath127 in principle .",
    "however the charm quark is not heavy enough , or @xmath121 is not small enough , these new parameters are not small in comparison with @xmath127 , or even they can be at the same size of @xmath127 .",
    "numerically , it is found that these parameters can significantly reduce the polarization parameter @xmath7 of @xmath0 .",
    "more explicitly , we have calculated the direct @xmath0 polarization , the prompt @xmath0 polarization and the indirect @xmath0 polarization from the @xmath12 decays .    without the spin - flip effect , we return to the same results with those in literature under the same parameters . while by taking the spin - flip interaction into consideration , the predicted @xmath7 is more close to those measured at tevatron . at large @xmath6 , @xmath7 for the prompt @xmath0",
    "is reduced by @xmath8 for @xmath9 and by @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "then such spin - flip interaction as have been argued by several authors may provide a suitable way to solve the @xmath0 polarization puzzle at tevatron .",
    "since the nlo correction shall provide a large @xmath225 factor of the total cross section ( ratio of nlo to lo ) , e.g. @xmath226 for color - singlet @xmath227 $ ] and @xmath228 for color - octet @xmath229 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] @xcite , and because the nlo can increase the transverse distributions of produced @xmath0 more than the total distributions , then the value of @xmath7 can be further lowed by including nlo results into our present calculation .",
    "further more , it has been argued that the production of @xmath0 associated with a @xmath223 quark pair might also help to dilute the @xmath0 polarization @xcite .",
    "such analysis is out of the range of the present paper , which is much more involved since it involves a nlo calculation of these processes with spin - flip effects being under consideration and a newly systematical determination of the color - octet matrix elements .",
    "more over , we have found that the predicted indirect @xmath0 polarization parameter @xmath208 depends weaker on the spin - flip effects than the case of direct and prompt @xmath0 production .",
