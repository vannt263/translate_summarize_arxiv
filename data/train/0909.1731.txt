    "a single - walled carbon nanotube is a two dimensional graphene sheet rolled into a cylinder .",
    "the diameter of the nanotube is on the order of a few nanometers , and its length can vary from hundreds of nanometers to centimeters . due to the small tube radius",
    ", electrons are confined in the azimuthal direction , and at sufficiently low energy the quantum confinement leads to an effectively one - dimensional electronic system .",
    "these nanotubes can be either metallic or semiconducting , and the low - energy electronic band structure can be studied using a long - wavelength expansion of the hamiltonian around each of the degenerate fermi points , labeled by k and k points .",
    "this long - wavelength theory is given by a pair of one dimensional dirac hamiltonians .",
    "when a nanotube is chemically functionalized or contains defects on the tube wall , localized scattering centers interrupt the free motion of its low - energy charge carriers .",
    "generally a localized defect can backscatter a propagating low - energy electron , either by large momentum scattering between the k and k valleys or by small momentum backscattering from forward to backward moving excitations within a single valley .",
    "superposition of right and left moving excitations produces various standing wave patterns in the electron density near such a defect .",
    "in this paper we consider forces on the scatterers produced by their interaction .",
    "it is easy to see that for an isolated scatterer , the backscattering - induced forces on the left and right hand side of the defect must exactly cancel , so there is no net force .",
    "however , for pairs of defects and generally for a distribution of defects at finite density , the forces on the left and right hand sides of the scatterer do not balance and mediate a net force on each scatterer . in previous work we explored this effect within a single valley model for the nanotube and found that the scattering induced forces could be mapped to a casimir - type problem , where the propagating electron waves provide the role of the background quantum field .",
    "importantly , the spinor character of these background fermions admits the possibility of attractive , repulsive or compensated null forces on the scatterers depending on the internal symmetry of their scattering potentials [ ] .    in this work",
    "we generalize these earlier results to study the combined effects of intravalley and intervalley backscattering .",
    "this extension proves to be crucial for a meaningful application to the nanotube problem .",
    "potentials that produce only intravalley scattering need to vary slowly on the scale of a lattice spacing . yet ,",
    "any local potential with this property degenerates to a one - dimensional scalar potential that can not backscatter a massless dirac particle .",
    "thus , for a local potential our effect ultimately requires a significant degree of spatial localization , and in this regime intervalley backscattering ultimately arises .",
    "indeed , we find below that for local potentials there is no regime in which the force problem can be regarded as confined to a single valley , necessitating a coupled valley formulation of the scattering problem .",
    "by contrast , non - local scattering potentials do allow the possibility of only intravalley backscattering in a controlled physically realizable limit .",
    "this situation is realized most naturally for electrons coupled to slowly varying lattice strains on a nanotube . in this paper",
    "we present a generalization of the formalism described in ref . [ ] suitable for application to the coupled two valley problem , and explore the forces that occur as a function of range and internal symmetry of the scattering potentials .",
    "we provide formulae that describe the electron mediated forces in these various geometries .",
    "table i provides a compact summary of our results .",
    "the magnitude and sign of the interaction is dictated by the internal structure of the scatterers .",
    "local potentials can describe atomically sharp impurities localized on a sublattice site .",
    "we find a repulsive force between local impurities residing on equivalent sublattice sites and an attractive force between scatterers on distinct sites .",
    "related results were recently shown for interactions between impurities in two - dimensional graphene [ ] .",
    "we also explore interactions between impurities where only intervalley scattering is present .",
    "interactions between defects due to large momentum backscattering were previously discussed in one - dimensional fermi liquids [ , ] . for non - local potentials",
    "we show that scattering persists for ranges that are larger than the lattice constant leading to the single - valley scattering problem .",
    "the results we obtain for casimir forces between non - local scatterers agree with our previous work .",
    "we recover the universal distance dependent power law decay for the casimir force in one - dimension .",
    "however , for local potentials , unlike for the single - valley problem , we also observe periodic spatial modulations in the force due to intervalley scattering .",

    "the signature of intervalley scattering is a spatial modulation of the scattering - induced forces .",
    "by contrast intravalley scattering mediates a force that can be either attractive or repulsive , but has a strength that decays monotonically as a function of increasing separation .",
    "interestingly , in all cases where the interaction is described by a local potential , the scattering problem is inevitably multivalley in character , and the energy and force of the species oscillate as a function of separation .",

    "the scatterers we describe in this paper can be physically realized by various atomic and molecular species adsorbed on the tube wall .",
    "these range from covalently bound atoms and molecules [ ] , to more weakly bound metallic species [ ] .",
    "the range of the scattering potential is determined by the size of the absorbed species relative to the lattice constant .",
    "the symmetry of the potential is determined by the spatial variation of on - site energies and by the modulation in the intersite hopping amplitudes produced by these species .",
    "covalently bound species provide the most natural candidates for the strongly coupled local potential models described in section [ sec : local ] . here",
    ", the on - site potential barrier at an adsorbed site can be as large as 5 ev enforcing an effectively hard wall boundary condition on the electronic wave functions . in this regime",
    "the results of section [ sec : flocal ] can be used to provide a bound on the electron - induced force .",
    "for example , the maximum attractive force between two scatterers in the impenetrable wall limit leads to an interaction energy of @xmath317 . with @xmath318 for nanotubes",
    "this gives an energy of @xmath319 at a range @xmath320 .",
    "note that its spatial form follows the same scaling law as the coulomb interaction between uncompensated charges , but it is reduced by a factor @xmath321 .",

    "similarly , this one - dimensional casimir interaction completely dominates the familiar van der waals interactions between charge neutral species that are mediated by the fluctuations of the exterior three dimensional electromagnetic fields .",
    "the weak coupling limit is relevant to the interactions of less strongly bound species , such as metal atoms or molecules bound by @xmath39 stacking interactions , e.g. benzene . here",
    "the energy scale for the local potential is more modest , of order 1 ev which , assuming a range of order a graphite lattice constant , corresponds to a dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath325 . in this weak coupling limit @xmath326 a local potential of @xmath327 ev results in @xmath328 mev at a distance of @xmath329 nm .",
    "though weaker , this interaction still decays slowly as a function of distance ( @xmath330 ) and will also dominate the electrostatic interaction between charge neutral dipoles in the far field .    in this weak coupling regime ,",
    "strain induced couplings , represented by non - local scatterers can be comparable in size . assuming a linear scaling of intersite hopping amplitudes with bond lengths following @xmath331 a bond length change of 0.2   and a potential range on the order of the lattice constant",
    ", this gives a dimensionless potential strength of @xmath332 and a weak coupling interaction @xmath333 , we find @xmath334 mev .",
    "these are of the same order as the forces produced by local potentials in the weak coupling limit .    for adsorbate - induced potentials ,",
    "it is difficult to realize a regime where the scattering is dominated by potentials with solely a nonlocal form .",
    "thus , one concludes that intervalley scattering and a residual spatial oscillation of the force is a generic property of inter adsorbate interactions mediated by the propagating electrons . it may be possible to quench the intervalley channel by application of a magnetic field along the tube axis which would have the effect of introducing a gap at either the k or k point and isolating the effects of intravalley scattering .",
    "we also note that strains can be engineered into these structures by application of mechanical stresses , and this might provide an avenue for realizing the predictions of the nonlocal model .",
    "in this paper we show that interactions between scatterers in metallic carbon nanotubes results in a one - dimensional casimir problem .",
    "we generalized our previous work which includes the one - valley problem of nanotubes , to incorporate the effects of intervalley scattering .",
    "we show that local potentials in nanotubes produce a two - valley scattering problem .",
    "the decoupling of the two valleys is not possible for a local potential since the range must be atomically sharp in order to produce finite backscattering .",
    "local potentials whose spatial extent is beyond the lattice constant result in scalar potentials which do not backscatter massless dirac fermions .",
    "non - local potentials , on the other hand , can result in a decoupled valley scattering problem .",
    "intervalley scattering amplitudes are parametrically smaller for finite range non - local potentials .",
    "therefore , we formulate a physically realizable potential which reduces to the one - valley scattering problem",
    ".    we study forces between two scatterers mediated by the propagating electrons of metallic carbon nanotubes . for interactions between both local and non - local potentials",
