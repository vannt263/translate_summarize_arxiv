    "random dirac fermions in 2 dimensions appear in various contexts in condensed matter physics .",
    "they were used to model disorder in systems with degenerate fermi surface @xcite , in the @xmath2-wave superconductors @xcite or to investigate the plateau transition in the integer quantum hall effect @xcite . in all these problems , the main question concerns the localization of quasiparticles , often different from the generic anderson localization .",
    "the universal properties of a system where randomness is present depend largely on the discrete symmetries , like time reversal invariance or spin rotation symmetry .",
    "this principle governs the wigner - dyson classification of random hermitian matrices @xcite .",
    "considering other discrete symmetries , like particle - hole or chiral symmetry , led altland and zirnbauer @xcite to extend this classification .",
    "however , it was recognized that the physics of 2d dirac fermions is richer than expected from the random matrix classification , in the sense that for the same symmetry class , some systems may be critical and other not .",
    "one reason is that in two dimension , the sigma models , which are supposed to describe the universal physics , can support a topological term . in the form of a theta or wzw term",
    ", they can render the model critical @xcite . sometimes , the presence of such a term can be deduced from general considerations @xcite , in other situations it can be obtained exactly @xcite .",
    "a possible strategy , adopted in @xcite and applied here to all classes , is to try to derive the effective sigma model , topological term included , by chain of controlled approximations .",
    "the drawback is that we have to consider a large number of fermion species @xmath0 in order to have a control parameter for the approximation .",
    "this means that the most interesting cases , where @xmath0 is small , are out of reach of this method .",
    "the symmetry classes for 2d random dirac hamiltonians , were recently analysed @xcite .",
    "the constraint that the discrete symmetries should also preserve the form of the dirac operator leads to a refinement of the altland - zirnbauer classification , in which the classes @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , appear each in two different forms . here",
    ", we pursue the characterization of the symmetry classes for the dirac hamiltonians of @xcite .",
    "we compute the beta function for all the disorder perturbations .",
    "when the number of fermion components @xmath0 is large the flow of the coupling constants generically closes on a single coupling constant , a fact which simplifies considerably the derivation of the effective action .",
    "this was done for classes @xmath6 in @xcite and for classes @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xcite , and we refer to these papers for the details of the method . without surprise , we obtain the sigma models defined on the manifolds identified by zirnbauer @xcite .",
    "the two different versions of classes @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 give rise to sigma models with or without a wzw term .",
    "we consider random dirac hamiltonians in 2d , in the representation @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are random matrix fields of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the discrete symmetries preserving the form of the dirac hamiltonian are @xcite @xmath16 the first condition will be called chiral symmetry , while the second one could be called particle - hole symmetry when @xmath17 and time reversal symmetry ( or spin rotation invariance ) when @xmath18 .",
    "the symmetry conditions impose constraints on the matrix fields @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which are listed in @xcite .",
    "we consider gaussian probability distribution for the disorder , compatible with the symmetry conditions .",
    "the spectral properties of the hamiltonians [ hamilt ] can be analysed using the supersymmetry @xcite ( or replica ) method , in which products of green functions are represented by gaussian integral over equal numbers of fermionic and bosonic dirac fields .",
    "average over gaussian randomness introduce effective coupling between the bosonic and fermionic fields , the coupling constants being the disorder variances .",
    "the first step of our analysis is the renormalisation group flow for the effective coupling constants .",
    "the analysis can be eventually performed at all orders @xcite . in the section [ beta ]",
    "we give the one loop beta functions for all the clases and for any @xmath0 .",
    "generically , at large @xmath0 the flow closes on a single coupling constant , corresponding to equal variances for different types of disorder .",
    "part of the disorder , specific to classes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this situation was analysed in the case @xmath23 in @xcite and in @xcite in a non - hermitian version of case @xmath19 . for the moment",
    ", we ignore this point and analyse the case of equal disorder variances . ] in this case , the effective interaction , quartic in the the dirac fields , can be decoupled via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation using a ( super)matrix field @xmath24 whose dimension does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the number of components of the dirac fields appear as an overall factor and it can be used as control parameter for a saddle point approximation .",
    "the effective action for the field @xmath24 , hence the saddle point equation , has global invariance , described by a group @xmath25 .",
    "the solutions of the saddle point equation break the invariance to a subgroup @xmath26 , so that the manifold of saddle points is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the low energy behaviour is obtained by taking slowly varying configurations of the field on @xmath27 ( goldstone modes ) and evaluating the action for these modes .",
    "the result is a sigma model on some symmetric ( super ) space .",
    "given the fact that in two dimensions sigma models can support a topological term , we may obtain a theta term or a wzw one .",
    "in the last section , we give a list of bilinears in dirac fields to which couple the field @xmath24 , the invariance group @xmath25 of @xmath24 , as well as a diagonal solution of the saddle point equation @xmath28 together with its stabiliser @xmath26 . together with the coupling constants , these are the basic ingredients to characterize the sigma model for each symmetry class .",
    "we use notations similar to @xcite . to obtain a compact notation , we introduce supermultiplets @xmath29 and similarly for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are fermion multiplets with @xmath0 components while @xmath34 and @xmath35 are bosonic ghostswith the same number of components .",
    "the superscript @xmath36 denotes transposition .    in the absence of disorder ,",
    "the action for the dirac fields is written @xmath37 and it corresponds to a conformal field theory with central charge @xmath38 . from the holomorphic ( antiholomorphic ) fields @xmath39 @xmath40 , one can construct the current algebra @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the perturbation induced by disorder is @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the disorder variances associated to different disorder invariants and the operators @xmath44 are defined as follows @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xmath47 are generators of @xmath48 normalized by @xmath49 and @xmath50 are subsets of indices of @xmath51 which depend on the symmetry class .",
    "@xmath52 is the identity normalized by @xmath53 .",
    "to study the renormalisation group flow for the coupling constants , we need the corresponding beta function .",
