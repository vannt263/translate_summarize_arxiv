    "as such , they are an extreme class of agn in the local universe , potentially holding important clues as to the origin of the @xmath0 relation ( see sect . 1 of li et al .",
    "2006 for a review on models ) , and whether it holds at all times and for all types of galaxies , and at low bh masses .    however , previous studies of nls1 galaxies , employing different samples and methods , led to partially conflicting results regarding the galaxies location on the @xmath0 relation .",
    "when using the width of the narrow [ oiii]5007 emission line , fwhm@xmath7}$ ] , as replacement for stellar velocity dispersion @xmath1 , most authors found that , on average , nls1 galaxies are _ off _ the @xmath8}$ ] relation ( mathur et al .",

    "most larger samples are actually based on fwhm@xmath7}$]/2.35 as surrogate for @xmath1 ( nelson 2000 ) , because the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath1 is very difficult to measure in nls1 galaxies due to superposed emission - line complexes .",
    "given the potentially far - reaching consequences of a deviation of low bh mass , highly accreting agn from the @xmath0 relation , independent studies of large(r ) samples of nls1 galaxies are important .",
    "no matter whether they turn out to be on or off the @xmath0 relation of non - active galaxies and bls1 galaxies , any result has important consequences : if nls1s lie off the relation , for the formation of the @xmath0 relation ( how do objects move onto the relation ? ) and/or the gaseous kinematics of their nlrs .",
    "if they lie on the relation the question is raised how to preserve @xmath0 _ along _ the relation in objects which are rapidly growing their bhs but are typically in non - merging galaxies ( krongold et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we have used an independent , large , homogeneously analyzed sample of nls1 galaxies ( 55 objects ) _ plus _ a comparison sample of bls1 galaxies ( 39 objects ) , in order to study their locus on the @xmath0 plane .",
    "we conclude that the width of the [ sii ] emission line , and of the narrow core of the [ oiii ] line ( but only after removal of [ oiii ] lines with high blueshifts ) , are the best available surrogates for stellar velocity dispersion @xmath1 .",
    "using these lines puts nls1 galaxies ( and bls1 galaxies ) , as a class , on the @xmath0 relation of non - active galaxies . throughout this paper",
    ", we use a cosmology with @xmath11=70 kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13=0.3 and @xmath14=0.7 .",
    "we use the sample of nls1 and bls1 galaxies of xu et al .",
    "sample selection , data preparation , and data analysis methods are described in detail in that work . in brief : the sample consists of nls1 galaxies from the catalogue of veron - cetty & veron ( 2003 ) , plus a comparison sample of bls1 galaxies from boroson ( 2003 ) at @xmath15 , which have detectable ( s / n@xmath165 ) [ sii ] emission in their _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ) dr3 ( abazajian et al . 2005 ) spectra .",
    "the galaxies of the two samples have similar redshift and absolute magnitude distributions .",
    "( 2007 ) corrected the sdss spectra for galactic extinction , decomposed the continuum into stellar and agn components , and then subtracted the stellar continuum contribution and the feii complexes from the spectra .",

    "special attention was paid to [ oiii ] profile shapes .",
    "the deviation of [ oiii ] profiles from single gaussians is well known , and nls1 galaxies show strong blue wings particularly often ( boroson 2005 and ref . therein ) .",
    "authors who previously used @xmath17}$ ] from nls1 galaxies were aware of this complication , and most of them did correct for it . in most cases they did so by using only the ` red ' half of the [ oiii ] line profile to measure the fwhm .",
    "wang & lu ( 2001 ) decomposed the [ oiii ] profiles into core and wing .",
    "we followed two approaches in measuring fwhm@xmath7}$ ] : ( a ) determination of the total fwhm of the summed two - component gaussian from a careful decomposition into a core and a blue wing component whenever present , fwhm@xmath7_{\\rm totl}}$ ] ; and ( b ) the fwhm of the core component of [ oiii ] , fwhm@xmath7_{\\rm core}}$ ] .",
    "emission lines other than [ oiii ] are well represented by a single gaussian .",
    "the lines [ sii]6716,6731 ( hereafter referred to as [ sii ] ) were both fit with the same width .",
    "we follow the standard procedure of using the radius(@xmath18)-luminosity(@xmath19 ) relation of bls1 galaxies ( which appears to hold for nls1 galaxies ; peterson et al .",
    "2000 ) to compute bh masses , following kaspi et al .",
    "we then compare our results with the @xmath6 relation of tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ; their eqn . 1 and 19 ) and of ferrarese & ford ( 2005 , ff05 hereafter ; their eqn . 20 ) .",
    "an error in black hole mass of 0.5 dex ( as in grupe & mathur 2004 ) was conservatively assumed .",
    "formal measurement errors in fwhm are typically 5 - 20% .",
    "we note that all sdss observations of our sample include emission from the entire nlr ( so we are not systematically excluding the outer parts of the nlr in the nearest objects ) . at the lowest redshift in our sample , @xmath20=0.034 ,",
    "an sdss fiber diameter of 3@xmath21 corresponds to 2 kpc , larger than typical nlrs .",
    "we investigated how the following factors affect the galaxies location on the @xmath0 plane : ( a ) different methods of fitting the [ oiii ] profile ; ( b ) the use of other emission lines as surrogates for @xmath1 ; and ( c ) the influence of other parameters , like [ oiii ] blueshift and @xmath4 .",
    "first , we confirm that nls1 galaxies as a class deviate from the @xmath0 relation of non - active galaxies if we use the full profile of [ oiii ] to measure @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we computed the deviation @xmath23 of the nls1 and bls1 galaxies from the ff05 relation . applying a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test shows that the two samples are drawn from different parent distributions ( k - s probability of being drawn from the same population : 0.002 ) .",
    "nls1 galaxies follow the @xmath0 relation much better if only the narrow core of [ oiii ] is used to measure @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . however , there are still a number of nls1 galaxies with very broad [ oiii ] profiles and these lie systematically below the @xmath0 relation . in sect .",
    "3.3 we identify the cause of this .",
    "we show that the majority of these ` [ oiii ] outliers ' are characterized by high nlr outflow velocities , and therefore , their velocity fields are not dominated by the bulge potential and their line widths can not be used as surrogates for @xmath1 .",
    "the strongest ( high - ionization ) emission line in agn spectra is [ oiii]5007 , which is commonly used for @xmath2 estimates . because of its strength , we are able to decompose the line into a core and blue wing .",
    "low - ionization emission lines generally do not show this spectral complexity , and we therefore also consider using their widths as surrogates for @xmath1 .",
    "the strongest lines in the commonly available wavelength range between @xmath24   are [ nii]6584,6548 , [ sii ] and [ oi]6300 .",
    "[ nii ] is , however , blended with h@xmath25 except in high - resolution spectra ( see zhou et al .",
    "2006 for the use of @xmath26}$ ] as a surrogate for @xmath1 ) .",
    "we focus on [ sii ] here , which is detected in all galaxies of our sample .",
    "as shown by greene & ho ( 2005 ) , @xmath27}$ ] is indeed a good substitute for @xmath1 in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "using the width of [ sii ] as a surrogate for @xmath1 , nls1 galaxies as a class are now _ on _ the @xmath0 relation ( fig .",
    "1 ) . repeating the k - s test on the @xmath28 distribution of nls1 and bls1 galaxies ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows that the two samples are consistent with being drawn from the same parent distribution ( k - s probability of 0.4 ) .",
    "we note that the fwhms of [ sii ] and [ oiii]@xmath3 correlate well with each other ( after removal of ` blue outliers ' ; sect .",
    "3.3 ) , demonstrating that both emission lines trace similar nlr velocity fields ( fig .",
    "only 40% of the nls1 galaxies of our sample have [ oi ] detected . the scatter in @xmath29}$ ]",
    "is relatively small and most galaxies are close to the ff05 relation , except two outliers with large @xmath29}$ ] .",
    "we investigated the influence of several quantities ",
    "[ oiii]@xmath3 blueshift , @xmath4 , intensity ratio feii4570/h@xmath5 , nlr density , and absolute magnitude  on the galaxies location on the @xmath0 plane .",
    "we divided each of these parameters into 3 bins : low values , intermediate values , and high values , such that about equal numbers of nls1 galaxies fell in each bin .",
    "we measured the velocity shift of [ oiii]@xmath3 , @xmath30}$ ] , relative to [ sii ] ( we use positive velocity values for blueshifts ) .",
    "@xmath31 was derived from the black hole mass , according to @xmath32 m@xmath33/m@xmath34 erg / s .",
    "the bolometric luminosity @xmath35 was estimated from the luminosity at 5100 , @xmath36 , and a bolometric correction of @xmath37 .",
    "the nlr density was derived from the density - sensitive [ sii ] intensity ratio , [ sii]6716/[sii]6731 ( xu et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the absolute magnitude from the sdss i - band magnitude .",
    "our aim is to search for trends across the @xmath0 plane in order to see whether we can identify physical mechanisms that determine an object s location on the plane , and , in particular , that are responsible for the [ oiii ] outliers .",
    "first , we find that almost all outliers in @xmath38}}$ ] actually show a very high blueshift of [ oiii]@xmath3 with a velocity shift @xmath30}$]@xmath16150 kms@xmath12 [ hereafter referred to as ` blue outliers ' ( zamanov et al .",
    "2002 ) ; marked in fig . 2 ] .",
    "more generally , we find the trend across the @xmath39}}$ ] plane that [ oiii ] lines of higher @xmath2 also show higher outflow velocity , revealing the presence of an extra radial velocity field presumably due to outflows . among the galaxies with positive @xmath28 ( those below the ff05 relation ) 49% are in the highest - velocity bin , while only 26% are in the lowest bin .",
    "however , if we exclude all galaxies with @xmath17}$ ] in the highest bin ( @xmath30}$]@xmath1675 kms@xmath12 ) , nls1 and bls1 galaxies show similar scatter and agree with the @xmath0 relation of normal galaxies ( fig .",
    "3 ; the k - s test shows that the two samples are not statistically distinguishable with k - s probability 0.5 ) .",
    "we have checked that [ sii ] is _ not _ systematically influenced by the outflow components that appear in [ oiii]@xmath3 .",
    "nls1 galaxies with blue outliers in [ oiii]@xmath3 are uniformly distributed across the @xmath0 plane in [ sii ] .    in order to see whether other parameters affect an object s location on the @xmath8}$ ] plane ( fig .",
    "2 ) , we first removed all objects with the highest [ oiii ] outflow velocities ( @xmath40 } > 75 $ ] km / s ) , and then studied the correlation of each parameter with the object s deviation from the ff05 relation , measured in terms of @xmath28",
    ". we can not identify a strong dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath4 ( spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath41=0.10 ) , above the highest value in our sample .",
    "] , feii4570/h@xmath5 ( @xmath41=0.05 ) , and density ( @xmath41=@xmath420.01 ) .",
    "however , if we keep all objects with high blueshifts , @xmath4 and @xmath28 are correlated ( @xmath41=0.34 ) . galaxies with higher absolute magnitudes m@xmath43",
    "are , on average , located at higher bh masses , as expected , but there is no systematic trend horizontally across the plane .",
    "we confirm the well - known result ( e.g. , grupe 2004 ) that nls1 galaxies have , on average , lower bh masses than bls1 galaxies ( in our sample , masses range between @xmath44 m@xmath34 , while @xmath45 m@xmath34 ) .",
    "we further confirm that nls1s are off the @xmath0 relation when [ oiii]@xmath46 is used as surrogate for @xmath1 , and that  after removing blue wings  [ oiii]@xmath3 gives more consistent results .",
    "however , after correction for blue wings several blue outliers still stick out with very large @xmath2 values .",
    "if these were to reach the @xmath6 relation moving vertically on the @xmath0 plane by growing their black holes , they would have to increase their current bh masses by factors @xmath16100 , and become more massive than the most massive bhs in the bls1 comparison sample .",
    "instead , the fact that all show high outflow velocities in [ oiii]@xmath3 demonstrates that the properties of the nlr ( unusual outflows in the high - ionization nlr ) drive the deviation of these nls1 galaxies from the @xmath0 relation .",
    "those galaxies which are extreme outliers in [ oiii ] still follow the @xmath0 relation in [ sii ] .",
    "there is good evidence that many nls1 galaxies are accreting at a high rate relative to the eddington rate ( even if not as high as in high - redshift quasars ; warner et al .",
    "2004 ) , so , as emphasized by mathur & grupe ( 2005a , b ) their bhs must be rapidly growing .",
    "since we find that they are on the @xmath0 relation now , their tracks on the @xmath0 plane must be diagonal , else they would deviate in the future .",
    "we distinguish two possibilities : ( 1 ) nls1 galaxies as a class _ evolve _ into bls1 galaxies with respect to their bh mass distribution .",
    "then , on average , the bhs of nls1 galaxies have to grow by a factor @xmath4710 . if accreting at @xmath4=1.0 this would take them 10@xmath48 years .",
    "if they did so , a corresponding change in @xmath1 of the bulge of the host galaxy is required in order to ensure that the @xmath6 relation still holds .",
    "recent host galaxy studies of nls1s indicate that they are not preferentially merging systems ( krongold et al .",
    "2001 , ryan et al .",
    "2007 ) , but have a relatively high bar fraction ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2003 , ohta et al .",
    "2007 ) . in that case",
    ", some secular mechanism must be at work to adjust the bulge properties . at this stage",
    ", we can only speculate that some of the feedback mechanisms ( silk & rees 1998 ) studied in the context of merger - induced bh fuelling ( e.g. , di matteo et al .",
    "2005 , king 2005 ) also hold for bar - induced fuelling .",
    "alternatively , ( 2 ) the nls1 mass distribution does _ not _ evolve into the bls1 mass distribution . in this picture ,",
    "nls1s are simply low - mass extensions of the bls1 phenomenon ( e.g. , mchardy et al .",
    "2006 ) . in that case",
    ", the high @xmath4 values could just represent a relatively _ short - lived _ accretion phase which would only insignificantly grow their bhs .",
    "then , within the large scatter of @xmath2 , no adjustment of the host s bulge would be needed .",
    "sources with relatively low @xmath4 could be before or after an accretion event .    in summary , we conclude that the nls1 and bls1 galaxies of our sample , as a class , follow the @xmath6 relation if we use as surrogate for @xmath1 the widths of emission lines which are not strongly affected by outflow components ( [ sii ] ; or [ oiii]@xmath3 _ after _ removing galaxies with high outflow velocities @xmath40}$ ] )",
    ". further studies of the evolution of highly accreting agn along the @xmath6 relation will shed new light on the evolution of galaxies in general and nls1s in particular .",
