    "a large body of observations at optical wavelengths exists for these luminous , high - density clusters , both ground - based ( arp & sandage 1985 ; prada , greve , & mckeith 1994 ; ho & filippenko 1996a , b ; gonzlez  delgado et al .",

    "1996 ) surveys of ngc  1569 have revealed spatially coincident emission from neutral and ionized atomic and molecular gas , with a pronounced hole at the location of the clusters themselves .",
    "such a hole is interpreted as the result of recent stellar winds and supernova explosions which should confine the ionized gas in a shell , such as actually observed around ngc  1569-a ( waller 1991 ; hunter , hawley , & gallagher 1993 ) .",
    "the supernova activity in the ngc  1569 sscs can also provide a significant fraction of the soft and most of the hard x - ray emission , as measured by asca and rosat ( della ceca et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "recently , the higher spatial resolution of the refurbished wfpc2 showed that cluster a is made of two components ( a1 and a2 , de  marchi et al .",

    "( 2000 ) analyzed deep wfpc2 images and resolved another 45 compact candidate star clusters .",
    "these clusters are distributed across the galaxy .",
    "about one quarter of the clusters are located in the vicinity of ngc  1569-a .",
    "the clusters span a wide range of ages , between a few myr up to 1  gyr , yet most of them are estimated to be quite young , having @xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath5 optical colors consistent with ages @xmath630  myr .",
    "while there is overall consensus that the sscs in ngc  1569 are young , the precise age of their burst episodes is still under debate .",
    "this is particularly relevant for ngc  1569-a1 and a2 whose combined spectra show features from both red supergiants and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "the simultaneous presence of the two types of stars is not predicted by instantaneous burst models but could be understood if the two populations originated in different clusters .",
    "alternatively , star formation ( sf ) episodes lasting several myr and/or the formation of wolf - rayet stars in binary systems ( e.g. , vanbeveren et al .",
    "1998 , vanbeveren 1999 ) could account for their spatial coexistence .",
    "a first step towards resolving this issue was made by buckalew et al .",

    "ultraviolet spectra of ngc  1569-a were obtained on 16 and 17  october 1996 .",
    "we used hst s fos to secure h - mode spectra with the red and blue channels .",
    "the fos was pointed at r.a.(2000 )  =  4:30:48.18 and dec(2000 )  =  + 64:50:58.6 , and a 4-stage peak - up sequence with the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 apertures was performed .",
    "this sequence was done for the red and blue channels separately . at the conclusion of each peak - up sequence ,",
    "ngc  1569-a was centered in the @xmath10 circular science aperture with a precision of better than @xmath11 , as verified from an analysis of the individual peak - up images .",
    "note that the post - costar diameter of the @xmath10 aperture is @xmath12 .",
    "the red - channel science observations were performed with the g190h and g270h gratings , which have dispersions of 1.45 and 2.05    per diode and cover 1590  -  2312    and 2222  -  3277   , respectively .",
    "the blue - side observations were done with g130h , whose dispersion and spectral range are 1    per diode and 1140  -1606   , respectively . + further information on the program and on the observation strategy can be found under program 6408 at http://presto.stsci.edu/public/propinfo.html .",
    "the raw data were retrieved from the hst archive and processed with the _ calfos _ pipeline using the recommended , best reference files .",
    "the main difference between the originally calibrated and the recalibrated data is due to the improved flat - fielding and dead - diode removal .",
    "we found these differences to be negligibly small in our case .",
    "a strong emission feature was found at @xmath131960   . since no astrophysically plausible emission line is expected around this wavelength , we interpreted this feature as due to an intermittent diode .",
    "transformation from pixel to wavelength space was done with the standard fos wavelength scales for the three gratings .",
    "ngc  1569 has a heliocentric velocity of @xmath14  km  s@xmath15  ( kinney et al . 1993 ) .",
    "this is small in comparison with the fos wavelength scale uncertainty of about 0.3   .",

    "the spectrum was smoothed with a 5-pixel boxcar filter .",
    "since the original spectrum was oversampled by four pixels , the boxcar smoothing almost retains the original spectral resolution .",

    "the iue aperture has dimensions @xmath17 , covering the whole central sf region in this galaxy .    at wavelengths below about 2500    the shapes of the fos and iue spectra are essentially identical , suggesting a spatially uniform foreground and intrinsic reddening within the galaxy and negligible aperture effects .",
    "the flux level of the fos data is lower by about a factor of 5 in comparison with iue . the iue spectrum becomes redder than the fos spectrum at the longest wavelengths plotted in fig .",
    "[ fos_iue ] .",
    "we interpret this flux excess as due to a surrounding , somewhat older population , which is included in the iue aperture .    the de - reddened fos spectrum of ngc  1569-a is shown in fig .  [ lum ] .",
    "conversion to luminosity units was done for an assumed distance of @xmath18  mpc ( de marchi et al .",

    "@xmath20 was found , in good agreement with the value quoted in the literature .",
    "the additional intrinsic component of @xmath19 was derived from a comparison of the observed spectral slope ( after correction for foreground reddening ) and the theoretical prediction @xmath21 ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "we adopted the starburst obscuration law of calzetti ( 1997 ) to derive an intrinsic reddening of @xmath22 .",

    "hst nicmos ir imaging of ngc  1569 with the f110w and f160w filters using the nic2 camera centered in between the sscs a and b was obtained on 25 february , 1998 .",
    "we performed a spiral dithering with a step size of @xmath24 for an on - source total integration time of about 85  min in each filter .",
    "the dithered frames have been combined using a drizzling technique , and the final images with @xmath25 pixel@xmath15 have been photometrically calibrated by transforming the count rates into the vegamag system , according to the photnu and zero point values reported in the nicmos web page .",

    "the sscs are barely resolved due to the width of the nic2 psf .",
    "we used romafot ( buonanno et al .",
    "1983 ) to fit each cluster luminosity profile with a moffat function after subtraction of the local background . with such a technique we can also properly deconvolve the two components in the double cluster ngc  1569-a .",

    "@xmath6340 m@xmath64  undergo mass loss mainly due to the strong stellar winds ( the single - star channel ; e.g. ; maeder & meynet 1994 and references therein ) , while roche lobe overflow in massive close binaries occurs at lower initial masses .",
    "this implies that the binary channel continues to form wr stars at later epochs than the single channel , and it extends the lifetime of the global wr population , since its progenitors can have initial masses smaller than the wr mass limit for single stars .",
    "recent models by schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) using evolutionary tracks with enhanced mass loss ( meynet et al .",
    "1994 ) and a wr binary frequency of 20% , show that there is a major age separation at @xmath135 myr between the single and binary channels . as a first order approximation",
    "the wr bump equivalent width scales proportionally to the binary frequency if the latter is not too large . according to the models of schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) ,",
    "equivalent widths of 3 - 4    in the @xmath494686 wr bump can be easily obtained at ages @xmath610 myr for binary frequencies @xmath650% .",
    "gonzlez  delgado et al .",
    "( 1997 ) used the geneva evolutionary tracks with standard mass loss and obtained an equivalent width of 3.4    slightly later , around 14  myr , for the same binary frequency .",
    "nevertheless , it is rather well established that the lower the mass loss , the later the appearance of the wr phase ( maeder & meynet 1994 ) .",
    "therefore the binary channel seems to be able to account for spatially coincident and coeval ( @xmath610 myr ) wr and rsg populations , even though with a relative high binary frequency and some fine tuning for the burst age .    on the other hand , as discussed in   4 ,",
    "there is strong observational evidence that cluster a is double and a1 is redder than a2 .",
    "this constraint favors a scenario where cluster a1 , slightly redder , contains rsgs , while a2 , the bluest , contains the wr stars and the o - star population ( cf .",
    "  3 ) , which can be likely coeval .",
    "if the blue and red populations are spatially separated , the single channel scenario for the formation of the wr stars is favored since in order to have only wrs and not rsgs the burst age should be @xmath65 myr . at this stage",
    "the binary channel is not yet fully active ( schaerer & vacca 1998 ) .    to summarize , the existing body of observations is consistent with the age sequence derived from the near - ir photometry : b and # 30 are the most evolved clusters ( @xmath6310 myr ) , a2 is the youngest ( @xmath65 myr ) , and a1 is intermediate .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) is of considerable interest for the interpretation of sscs as progenitors of present - day globular clusters . if low - mass stars are not present in significant numbers , sscs are unlikely to evolve into old globular clusters , either because their dynamical survival times would be too short or because they would simply fade on a cosmologically short time scale .",
    "the observed mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath65 ) allows constraints on the imf since the luminosity is dominated by the high - mass end , and the mass by the low - mass end of the distribution . due to their low luminosity , low - mass stars",
    "can only be inferred via their gravitational forces , e.g. , by measuring the velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "this experiment was done by ho & filippenko ( 1996a , b ) who resolved the rsg features in the optical spectrum of ngc  1569-a .",
    "their ground - based spectra could not separate the two components of this double cluster but since a1 is brighter than a2 one can reasonably assume that the spectrum is dominated by the former .",
    "sternberg ( 1998 ) analyzed the visual mass - to - light ratio , @xmath66 , using the mass derived from ho s & filippenko s measurement .",
    "since the crossing time scale is much shorter than its age , the cluster is expected to be dynamically mixed , and the virial theorem can be used to infer the dynamical mass . using the same methodology as sternberg , but adopting a distance of 2.2  mpc and a half - light radius of 1.6  pc ( de marchi et al .",
    "1997 ) , we infer a dynamical mass of @xmath67  m@xmath64 . our new near - ir data allow us to extend the mass - to - light ratio analysis to the wavelength region where rsgs are brightest .",
    "we transformed the luminosities from our hst optical and ir photometry ( table  1 ) into the standard johnson system and adopted a conservative error of a factor of 2 in either direction for the @xmath65 ratio in each passband .",
    "the error is dominated by the systematic uncertainties of the cluster mass . in order to be able to perform a comparison with evolutionary synthesis models , we need to assume an age for cluster a1 .",
    "we assign conservative upper and lower limits of 15 and 5  myr , respectively .",
    "the upper limit comes from the presence of the co feature ( hunter et al .",
    "2000 ) , which could bring the age of a1 close to that of b , and the lower limit is imposed by the occurrence of the first rsgs according to stellar - evolution models .    in fig .",
    "[ movl ] we compare the derived mass - to - light ratios to those expected from evolutionary synthesis models by leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) . the panels in this figure show the models for four different imfs and for metallicities of z@xmath64 , 1/4  z@xmath64 , and 1/10  z@xmath64 .",
    "the 1/4  z@xmath64  models should be most appropriate for ngc  1569 but we provide models with higher and lower metallicity as a guide for the expected uncertainties , since evolutionary tracks do not properly account for metallicity effects in rsgs ( cf .",
    "origlia et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we explored a variety of imf parameters with the goal of constraining the relative fraction of low - mass stars .",
    "the imf is approximated by a power law of the form @xmath68 between the adopted lower and upper mass limits , @xmath69  and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the low - mass star contribution is increased by increasing @xmath2 and/or by lowering @xmath69 .",
    "a salpeter imf has @xmath71 in this nomenclature .",
    "[ movl ] illustrates four examples : models with a standard salpeter s imf ( top panel ) , models with a deficit in low - mass stars resulting either from a truncated or a flatter imf compared to the standard salpeter s ( central panels ) and models with a low - mass truncation and a steeper imf slope ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the best fits to the data have been obtained with a standard salpeter imf with lower mass cutoff down to the hydrogen - burning limit or an imf truncated at @xmath72 and with a very steep slope over the whole range of masses , but this latter imf is not commonly observed in stellar populations .",
    "hence , even accounting for the uncertainties in the evolutionary models , fig  [ movl ] generally does not support an imf deficient in low - mass stars .",
    "the strongest constraint comes from the @xmath35 and @xmath36 luminosities , which sample rsgs .",
    "these near - ir data support the previous result of sternberg ( 1998 ) that ngc  1569-a has a normal imf with no deficit in low - mass stars .",
    "the four young sscs are very luminous and can provide a significant fraction of the total light in the central region of ngc  1569 . in order to estimate such a contribution at different wavelengths , we compare the luminosity of the clusters to the integrated galaxy luminosity within a circular aperture of 14@xmath73 in diameter , centered on ngc  1569-a .",
    "this region corresponds to the overlap between the pc and nic2 frames .",
    "a major uncertainty in the aperture photometry computations comes from the subtraction of the local background , particularly in the ir . as an upper limit to this background",
    "we assume the average value measured in the less crowded regions , and as a lower limit we assume zero background .",
    "the relative contributions of the sscs to the total luminosities in the 14@xmath73 area have been derived for both assumptions for the background .",
    "the fractional contribution of the four clusters in all five filters is plotted in fig .",
    "the sscs provide 20  -  25% of the central luminosity in the blue and near - ir , due to the dominant ob and red supergiant populations , respectively .",
    "a high efficiency of sf in sscs was determined by meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in a large sample of starburst galaxies , and recently confirmed , e.g. , in the infrared - luminous galaxy merger ngc  3256 ( zepf et al .",
    "the fact that the efficiency is high in a wide variety of interstellar environments ( low and high metal content ; low and high galaxy luminosity ) suggests that sf in clusters is a rather common process .",
    "aloisi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) performed daophot psf fitting photometry on the nic2 frames and found objects with @xmath74 and sharpness parameters exceeding the typical values of well - fitted , single stars .",
    "some of these anomalous stellar sources can be small star clusters which are not properly resolved and extended in comparison to the adopted psf .",
    "we analyzed the properties of these cluster candidates in an attempt to clarify their relation to the four luminous super star clusters . in order to isolate such possible candidate clusters from pure blends or spurious detections we selected those objects with f110w@xmath619.5 , @xmath75 and sharpness  @xmath76 in the f110w filter and we rejected the ones in positional coincidence with the four sscs for which we obtained more accurate photometry ( cf .",
    "  2.2 ) .",
    "the selected sharpness threshold is somewhat less conservative than the 0.4 value adopted by aloisi et al .",

    ", we constructed the @xmath77 , @xmath46 color - magnitude diagram ( fig .",
    "[ jmh ] , bottom panel ) , assuming a distance modulus @xmath78 . for comparison",
    ", we also included the integrated ir photometry of a sample of 60 magellanic cloud ( mc ) clusters ( persson et al .",
    "1983 ) , according to the age classification of searle , wilkinson , & bagnuolo ( 1980 , hereafter swb ) . since their sample is infrared - selected , even the youngest mc clusters are already in the rsg phase , hence they have ages @xmath795  myr .    as discussed by many authors ( e.g. , chiosi et al .",
    "1986 ; girardi & bica 1993 ; santos & frogel 1997 ; brocato et al . 1999 ) , the color distributions of the mc clusters as a function of cluster age can be affected by systematic biases , like stochastic effects due to the intrinsic small number of luminous red stars in the young and intermediate age clusters , but also by some metallicity spread among different clusters and the possible galaxy field contamination .",
    "bearing in mind such biases , we can nevertheless follow a statistical approach to investigate their color distribution and ages .",
    "the youngest mc clusters ( @xmath8040  myr , swb type",
    "i ) have @xmath46 between 0.4 and 0.8 , with a peak distribution around 0.6  -  0.7 ( see fig .",
    "[ jmh ] , top panel ) .",
    "the sscs b and # 30 , whose near - ir luminosity is dominated by the red supergiants , have indeed such colors .",
    "the ssc a1 is at the border line , while a2 is definitively too blue to fit into this category .",
    "this classification agrees quite well with the age sequence we established before for the four clusters .",
    "the mc clusters with ages between 40 and 100  myr ( swb type ii , iii ) have on average slightly bluer @xmath46 , with a peak around 0.4  -  0.5 , since less massive red stars contribute to their ir luminosity , hence some contamination by a warmer component can be possible .",
    "older mc clusters ( swb type iv , v , vi ) with ages between a few hundred myr and a few gyr show a peak around @xmath81 . the spread is much larger because stochastic effects become more important in this age range .",
    "finally , the oldest ( and possibly most metal - poor ; sagar & pandey 1989 ) mc clusters of swb type vii have @xmath82 .",
    "the majority of the 20 candidate clusters identified in our nic2 field of ngc  1569 have @xmath46 colors consistent with swb type  i mc clusters ( i.e. , they are rsg dominated ) , or with much older ones ( swb type iv , v , vi )",
    ". clusters with ages around 100  myr seem to be deficient ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ jmh ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we can not exclude that some of the faintest objects with very red @xmath46 colors are massive agb stars with somewhat contaminated luminosity profiles .",
    "fos uv spectroscopy and nicmos ir photometry of the most luminous super star clusters in ngc  1569 allow a significant improvement over previous relative age - dating attempts .",
    "the four most luminous clusters a2 , a1 , b , and # 30 form an age sequence from @xmath135 to 30  myr . a1 and a2 are the two components of the double - cluster a. most of the total light of a comes from a1 , with the fractional contribution of a2 increasing towards shorter wavelengths . the subcomponents are shown to be in slightly different evolutionary stages .",
    "a1 is the older of the two clusters and has a significant rsg population .",
    "the uv spectrum of a1 and a2 combined reveals an o - star population with an age of less than @xmath135  myr .",
    "the spectroscopy does not provide clues as to whether the o stars are confined in one of the two components .",
    "however , if ngc  1569-a behaves like a typical high - mass star - forming region , the o population is anti - correlated with the rsgs , and is therefore located in cluster a2 .",
    "the archetypal giant h  ii region 30  doradus with its central cluster r136 can serve as a well studied nearby test case .",
    "both hot and cool massive stars are found in 30  doradus but they are separated on scales of a few pc .",
    "no rsgs are observed at the formation site of the youngest o- and wr stars , and vice versa , such hot stars are absent in hodge  301 , the cluster containing rsgs ( walborn 1984 ) .",
    "if r136 were observed at a distance corresponding to ngc  1569 , both the o - star and the rsg population would coincide spatially .    while the fos spectroscopy lacks the spatial resolution for a definitive answer , hst wfpc2 he  ii imagery by buckalew et al .",
    "( 2000 ) clearly demonstrated an anti - correlation of the light from rsgs and wr stars .",
    "this is consistent with observations in the magellanic clouds : wr stars of type wnl and o stars are always observed together in metal - poor clusters and ob associations ( massey et al .",
    "1995 ) , but not in the vicinity of rsgs .",
    "it is therefore highly plausible that the o - star population in ngc  1569-a coincides with the wr population , which in turn is anti - coincident with the rsgs .",
    "this then implies that cluster a1 is older and contains rsgs , and a2 is younger and hosts the o- and wr population .",
    "ngc  1569-b and cluster # 30 are older and fully dominated by red supergiants , as indicated by their red ir colors .",
    "the former is at the peak of the rsg phase ( @xmath1310 myr ) , while the latter , with redder optical colors , is slightly older , close to the end of this evolutionary stage ( @xmath6330 myr ) .",
    "the four sscs also provide a significant fraction ( @xmath1325% ) of the total uv and ir light in the central region of the galaxy , suggesting that highly efficient star formation per unit area occurs in stellar clusters .    from a comparison of the optical to ir mass - to - light ratios in ngc  1569-a1 with evolutionary synthesis models",
    ", we find that a standard salpeter imf with lower mass cutoff down to the hydrogen - burning limit is consistent with the data . unless gravitational forces lead to cluster disruption , ngc  1569-a1 can evolve into a system whose properties are quite similar to those of present - day globular clusters .",
    "other candidate stellar clusters , less luminous than the four sscs discussed above , have been identified in the central region of ngc  1569 .",
    "they span a wide range of ages , even though the majority of them have near ir colors more consistent with a dominant , young stellar population in the rsg phase . in that respect the clusters in ngc  1569 resemble the populous young clusters in the magellanic clouds .",
