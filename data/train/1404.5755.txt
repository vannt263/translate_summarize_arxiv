    "the origin and the evolution of fluorine in the galaxy are still nowadays a matter of debate .",
    "the available observational constraints , coupled with stellar nucleosynthesis models , have not yet clarified which stellar mass ranges and in which evolutionary stages are the mainly responsible for the fluorine production .",
    "therefore , further and new observational evidence is needed , to understand where fluorine is produced and its implications on the stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the state of the art proposes three means of fluorine production : neutrino spallation on @xmath3ne in gravitational supernovae ( snii ; woosley & haxton 1988 ) , hydrostatic nucleosynthesis in the he - burning core of heavily mass - losing wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( meynet & arnould 2000 ) , and hydrostatic nucleosynthesis in the he - rich intershell of thermally pulsing ( tp ) agb stars ( busso et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it is still unknown which of the three above sources is the main contributor for fluorine .",
    "the above scenario is based on several observational studies that , during the last decade , have been addressed the problem of the fluorine origin and evolution .",
    "fluorine determinations were carried out in different environments : namely : i ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite ; ii ) the globular cluster m  4 @xcite and m 22 @xcite ; iii ) the milky way bulge @xcite ; iv ) pre - main sequence stars of the orion nebula cluster @xcite and dwarf stars of the solar neighbourhood @xcite ; v ) galactic and extragalactic asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite ; vi ) in one hot post - agb star @xcite ; vii ) in c - rich low - metallicity stars @xcite ; viii ) in planetary nebulae @xcite ; ix ) in the interstellar medium surrounding type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "these recent studies enlarged and in some cases reanalyzed the sample of stars presented in @xcite . almost all the above fluorine analyses have been developed using spectral features of the hf molecule ( mostly the r 9 line at @xmath4=2336.47 nm ) .",
    "a _ theoretical _ list of hf molecular parameters ( e.g. log__gf _ _ , e@xmath5 ) , provided by r.h .",
    "tipping ( see e.g.  abia et al .",
    "2009 ) , was in general adopted , together with an old solar abundance derived by @xcite , a(f)@xmath6=4.56 .",
    "very recently , a new list of _ experimental _ molecular parameters for the hf molecule has been delivered by the hitran database ( see * ? ? ? * for details on this database ) .",
    "therefore , we started a new analysis of the fluorine abundance based on these new data .",
    "more in detail : i ) we reanalyzed the solar fluorine abundance as observed in sunspot spectra with modern techniques : sunspot specific spectrosynthesis simulations and atmospheric model .",
    "ii ) we collected , for the first time , spectra of giant star members of two galactic open clusters ( ocs ) , m  67 and ngc  6404 , in the infrared region , where hf lines were detected and analyzed .",
    "the solar fluorine abundance is used as a zero - point for all the other dedicated studies , hence a redetermination in light of the above new molecular parameters and of more recent analysis techniques was needed ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , this work is the starting point of a new project which consists in the fluorine determination in several open clusters , with different ages and galactocentric distances ( r@xmath7 ) .",
    "in fact , this investigation offers the opportunity of measuring fluorine evolution during the last @xmath010 gyr as a function of time .",
    "this can be done since the age estimate of ocs can be performed with a smaller uncertainty than for field stars . in turn , the knowledge of the fluorine evolution provides also a further constraint to understand which kind of stars ( low mass or more massive stars ) is mostly responsible to its production . at the same time , the analysis of the m  67 cluster is also a good test of the solar fluorine determination , since this cluster shows a solar - like abundance distribution and its age , metallicity and r@xmath7 resemble those of the sun , so that it can be considered as a _ solar analogue _ cluster .    in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and the analysis for the fluorine determination in the sun , while section 3 is focused on fluorine in open clusters .",
    "section 4 shows our results , while in section 5 and 6 we discuss results , giving our final conclusions .",
    "in order to determine the solar fluorine abundance we employed the spectral atlas by @xcite of a medium strong sunspot umbra , observed on 1982 may 16 with the kitt peak fts near disk center ( @xmath8 ) . the spectral atlas has a resolution of @xmath9 . the observed spot had an associated magnetic field strength of 2490 g. we used spectral lines of the oh ( in the spectral region around 1.565 @xmath10 m ) and co molecules ( near the hf lines we analyzed ) to decide on the appropriate effective temperature of models to be used for the fluorine abundance determination .",
    "the umbral atlas is corrected for telluric absorption , but not for scattered light originating from the much brighter surrounding photosphere . however , in the infrared the contribution from scattered photospheric light is only of the order of a few percent in the continuum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and should have little effect on the shallow hf lines we employ .",
    "we determined the abundances of f by fitting the observed spectra with simulated ones .    for fitting the solar umbral atlas we used the rh code of @xcite to calculate molecular spectral lines in lte from the one - dimensional radiative equilibrium models of @xcite with different effective temperatures .",
    "the transfer code was used to solve chemical equilibrium for the most abundant molecules in the solar atmosphere , h@xmath11 , c@xmath11 , n@xmath11 , o@xmath11 , ch , co , nh , no , oh , and the hf molecule .",
    "dissociation energies and parametrization with temperature of the equilibrium constants and partition functions for these molecules were taken from @xcite .",
    "line lists for the co and oh molecules were taken from @xcite and kurucz ( ` http://kurucz.harvard.edu/linelists/linesmol/ ` ) , respectively .",
    "molecular parameters for hf lines have been recently measured and can be found in the hitran database ( ` http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/ ` ) . as we said in the introduction , this is a relevant improvement in fluorine studies , since up to now these data were provided by r.h .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to the 2490 g vertical magnetic field in the observed sunspot umbra .",
    "in particular , since the ground state of the hf molecule is x @xmath13 , with a total orbital angular momentum @xmath14 we could use hund s case ( b ) for weak or absent spin - orbital coupling to calculate the line splittings by the zeeman effect . for most hf lines at the wavelengths of interest the effective land @xmath15 factors turned out to be very small , around 0.03 to 0.05 , except for the hf r1 line , which has a larger factor of 0.25 .",
    "thus , in general the zeeman effect in hf lines matters very little for the solar fluorine abundance determination from an umbral spectrum .",
    "since the association  dissociation equilibrium of the hf molecule is strongly temperature - dependent we need to accurately determine the effective temperature of the atmospheric model that is most compatible with the solar umbral atlas we used ( section  [ sec : umbralatlas ] ) .",
    "we accomplished this by matching co lines in the range of the pertinent hf lines , and oh lines in the 1.5@xmath10 m wavelength range .",
    "in particular , the latter lines are highly temperature sensitive as is clear in figure  [ fig_oh ] , which shows the solar umbral atlas ( blue diamonds ) around 1565 nm , together with three model spectra : the medium umbral model by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mackkl ) , and two radiative - equilibrium models ( with solar gravity ) from @xcite at effective temperatures of 4500 k ( solid , light blue ) and 4250 k ( medium blue ) . in all cases a constant vertical magnetic field of 2500 g was imposed , and the zeeman splitting of the oh lines as well as the line at 1564.85 nm was accounted for .",
    "zeeman splitting under these conditions does not affect the stronger oh lines at 1565.20 nm and 1565.35 nm much because they have small effective land @xmath15 factors of 0.08 , while the blended oh lines at 1565.06 nm and 1565.08 nm with land factors of 0.18 are slightly broadened .",
    "the is completely split into its three components because of its large land @xmath15 factor of 3 .",
    "note that the central @xmath16 component in the model is weaker than in the observation because we assumed a vertical field viewed at @xmath8 , while the actual ( average ) field was most likely not as vertical , and that the aperture of the spectrometer was several arcsec accross allowing it to sample different field strengths and inclinations , explaining the much larger broadening of the iron line spectral components compared to that of the oh lines .",
    "clearly , the @xmath17 k case provided the best match to the oh lines , in particular for the weaker oh lines , which form in the deeper layers of the umbral atmosphere , like the hf lines we analyzed for our abundance determination .",
    "we , therefore , adopted this latter model in what follows .    ]      ]    we estimated the solar fluorine abundance by determining a best fit of the 8 hf feautures visible in the umbral atlas , namely the r1 through r14 lines in the 2.2  2.5 @xmath10 m region of the spectrum employing the @xmath17 k radiative equilibrium model with a vertical magnetic field of 2500 g , constant with height .",
    "figure [ fig_hf_sun ] shows the best fit with an abundance of @xmath18 .",
    "all hf lines are well reproduced with this value , apart from the r1 line , which forms in a spectral range that is heavily affected by telluric contamination , as are the regions near 2475.05 nm , 2349.13 nm , 2363.35 nm , and 2288.8 nm .",
    "other lines in the 8 spectral windows arise from the co first overtone vibration  rotation band .",
    "the weaker lines of this band , forming in similar layers of the atmosphere as the hf lines are matched very well with the @xmath17 k model atmosphere , indicating that our choice for the effective temperature is appropriate .",
    "the stronger co lines , forming in higher layers are not so well matched , presumably because these layers of the sunspot umbra may not be well described by a hydrostatic radiative equilibrium model that does not account for the structure of the spot s magnetic field .",
    "the difference between the previously accepted value of the solar fluorine abundance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , a(f)@xmath6=4.56 ) and our result stems mainly from our use of the new experimental lower level energy values provided by the hitran data base ( see the differences in table  [ tab_flulin ] ) .",
    "sources of uncertainty are discussed in section [ sec_solaruncert ] .",
    "one of the largest uncertainties in the determined solar fluorine abundance is the choice of abundances of oxygen and carbon we used , which influences the choice of the effective temperature of the umbral model .",
    "we employed the newer values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 recommended by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "these values constitute a downward revision from the values obtained with more traditional one - dimensional models that is motivated by modeling in three - dimensional simulations .",
    "using the larger older values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 would force us to adopt a slightly hotter model for the umbra , mainly because the oh lines at 1565 nm would strengthen too much in our canonical model . with the @xmath23",
    "k model the stronger oh lines fit with the larger oxygen and carbon abundances , but the weaker ones are too shallow .",
    "the first overtone co lines near the hf lines are all slightly too deep with the higher effective temperature and the larger abundances . the fluorine abundance needed to fit the higher temperature model is @xmath24 , so that the uncertainty in effective temperature constitutes an uncertainty in the fluorine abundance of about 0.25 dex .",
    "overall , however , the fits for oh , co and hf lines is better with the smaller oxygen , carbon and fluorine abundances and the 4250 k model .",
    "moreover , given the strongly reduced convection in sunspot umbrae , we feel confident that the newer c and o abundances apply even when we use static one - dimensional atmospheric modeling .",
    "the other factor in the downward revision of the solar fluorine abundance we recommend is the new set of experimental hf line parameters from the hitran data base . indeed , as we said above , the uncertainty in the temperature estimate of the sunspot spectrum could affect the f abundance of about 0.25 dex . if we use the old molecular parameters from tipping , with the corresponding partition function in the spectrosynthesis code ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the c , o abundances from @xcite , we find a best match in the @xmath17 k model of @xmath25 , slightly below the original determination of @xcite .",

    "hence , the standard deviation of the distribution includes also the uncertainty in the continuum placement and the point - to point scatter . despite this , for the uncertainty in the cluster mean abundance , we prefer to adopt the star - to - star abundance scatter as our best estimate of the error in the analysis .",
    "we then added to this the uncertainties due to blends with cn lines and due to the determination of atmospheric parameters .",
    "* we note that the warmer stars in the two clusters show abundances systematically higher ( by about 0.1 dex ) with respect to the cooler giants s488 ( in m 67 ) and 40 in ( ngc 6404 ) .",
    "this behaviour is motivated by the fact that in warmer stars , the fluorine detection is more difficult , hf lines are less visible and less sensitive to abundance variations .",
    "although in the cluster mean abundances we attributed the same weight to all the analyzed stars , we consider the estimates in the two cooler stars as more reliable .",

    "our new solar determination of the fluorine abundance represents a strong improvement with respect to the previous analysis by @xcite .",
    "in fact , we adopted for the first time a set of experimental molecular parameters , modern spectrosynthesis tools , recent models of stellar atmosphere , we considered the magnetic field and the zeeman splitting and a modern solar abundance compilation .",
    "all of these issues led us to a better description of the observed sunspot spectrum ( e.g. , good fit of all the co , oh and hf features ) and to a downward revision of the solar fluorine abundance , that now turns out to be a(f)=4.40@xmath320.25 .",
    "the new experimental molecular data are the main responsible for this revision , as we showed in section 3.4 .",
    "the error mainly reflects the uncertainty in the temperature determination of the sunspot spectrum .",
    "we note that our new solar fluorine is in a very good agreement with the meteoritic value , a(f)=4.42 from @xcite .",
    "moreover , we find that the very good abundance agreement between our solar determination and those in the m 67 giants , is a further strong test for the reliability of our solar result . as we said in the introduction ,",
    "the m 67 cluster shows chemical abundances very similar to the sun for all the studied elements .",
    "our analyzed giants have not modified their initial fluorine abundance , therefore we expect , and actually find the same agreement between the m 67 and solar fluorine abundance , as for the other elements . moreover ,",
    "the analysis that we performed in its giant stars is completely different from that required in the sun ( e.g. , no magnetic field , different spectrosynthesis code ) .",
    "essentially , for the same metallicity , we made here two independent , different and careful analyses of fluorine , one in m 67 and one in the sun .",
    "this results in a very good agreement and makes our estimate quite robust .",
    "considering fluorine in ocs , in a recent paper by @xcite , f abundance was determined in the hyades , ngc 752 , and m 67 clusters .",
    "their different set of molecular parameters and solar fluorine abundance makes a comparison of their work with our results very difficult .",
    "a fluorine enhancement at younger ages is found by @xcite , but they used several upper limits for the fluorine abundance . with our two determinations of fluorine in m 67 and ngc 6404",
    "we can also contribute to trace the trend of the fluorine abundance with age .",
    "indeed , the two clusters have very different age : 4.3 gyr m 67 ; 0.5 gyr ngc 6404 ( see table [ tab_clupar ] ) .",
    "* we notice that the cloud from which ngc 6404 formed , received the yields of the nucleosynthesis of long - lived low - mass agb stars ( mass below @xmath01.5 m@xmath6 ) .",
    "on the contrary , stars less massive than @xmath01.5 m@xmath6 did not have time to contribute to the chemical composition of the old m 67 primordial cloud .",
    "therefore differences in the fluorine abundance in these ocs could be the signature of nucleosynthesis in the above low mass agb stars .",
    "recent works on stellar theoretical models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that low mass agb stars should have a larger @xmath44c-@xmath45n pocket than previously assumed .",
    "these works explored the influence of a larger reservoir rich in neutron capture products and their parents .",
    "since @xmath45n is responsible for the fluorine production , an increase of its content inside low mass agb stars could affect their fluorine production .",
    "the observation of the fluorine abundance in several open clusters with different ages , started in this work , will allow us : i ) to trace the evolution of fluorine during the last 5 - 6 gyr up to very recent periods ; ii ) through chemical evolution models , to estimate the contribution from low mass agb stars ; iii ) to compare the latter with the prescriptions of the quoted new theoretical models .",
    "* looking at our cluster mean abundances , we find that the [ f / h ] ratio is slightly overabundant in the younger open cluster ngc 6404 .",
    "the difference between the two ocs is however only @xmath00.1 dex , well below the uncertainty of each measure , hence we are not yet able to provide convincing constraints to the fluorine evolution . moreover , the two ocs are located at very different r@xmath7 and have a different metallicity .",
    "indeed looking at the [ f / fe ] ratios in the two analyzed ocs , we find solar [ f / fe ] values in both , that in turn would indicate that the fluorine evolution is not strongly influenced by low - mass stars .    to summarize , new measurements of fluorine in many other open clusters are required .",
    "in particular , determinations in several ocs at different bins of galactocentric radius and age are needed , in order to trace the fluorine evolution in different zones of the galaxy .",
    "this would enhance the statistics of the analysis and would produce a more robust result even in this case , where individual abundance determinations are affected by uncertainties of around @xmath320.2 dex .",
    "* we derived a new solar fluorine abundance in the spectral atlas of @xcite of a medium strong sunspot umbra .",
    "we used experimental molecular data from the hitran database for the hf lines and modern spectrosynthesis tools , taking into account the magnetic field of the sunspot : our result is a(f)@xmath6=4.40@xmath320.25 .",
    "* we collected new spectra in the infrared region , with the crires spectrograph , for 7 giant stars of two open clusters : m  67 and ngc  6404 .",
    "* we derived fluorine abundances for the observed stars using : i ) stellar parameters derived with photometric calibrations , and ii ) the synthesis of their spectra .",
    "uncertainties due to cn blends and stellar parameters were evaluated .",
    "the total error was estimated to be @xmath320.20 dex .",
    "the abundance in m 67 is in a very good agreement with our new solar estimate , while fluorine in the younger oc ngc 6404 is @xmath00.1 dex higher than the value in m 67 .",
    "looking at [ f / fe ] ratios , we found solar values in the two analyzed ocs . * future studies of fluorine in several other open clusters with different ages and located at different r@xmath7 , will allow us to trace its evolution in different zones of the galaxy .",
    "it will also show the relevance of the agb contribution to the synthesis of fluorine , improving our understanding of the its origin .",
