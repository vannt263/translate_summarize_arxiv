    "for fifty years the metal - insulator transition has been one of the central themes@xcite of condensed matter physics .",
    "the type we address here does not involve spatial disorder nor change of the number of charge carriers per cell ; the competing tendencies arise solely from the kinetic and potential energies in the hamiltonian , favoring itineracy and localization respectively , and the many real - material complexities that arise .",
    "the classic categorization is that of the mott transition , treated in its most basic form with the single - band hubbard model . much has been learned about this model , but there are very few physical systems that are modeled faithfully by such a model .",
    "real materials involve multiorbital atoms and thus extra internal degrees of freedom , and an environment that is often very active and may even react to the configuration of active sites .",
    "mno is a transition metal monoxide ( tmo ) with open @xmath0 shell that qualifies as one of the simpler realizations of a prototypical , but real , mott insulator .",
    "it is , certainly , a multiorbital system with the accompanying complexities , but the half - filled @xmath0 bands lead to a spherical , spin - only moment at ambient pressure . applying pressure to such",
    "a system leads to a number of possibilities , including insulator - metal transition , moment reduction , volume collapse if a first - order transition ( electronic phase change ) occurs , and any of these may be accompanied by a structural phase transition , that is , a change in crystal symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0 band width w of such a mott insulator is very susceptible to applied pressure , and is one of the main determining factors of the strength of correlation effects .",
    "the `` closed subshell '' aspect makes mno an atypical @xmath0 monoxide , as shown for example by saito _",
    "_ , who compiled@xcite effective parameters for this system from spectroscopic information .",
    "an effective intra - atomic coulomb repulsion energy as defined by them , for example , is roughly twice as large as for the other @xmath0 monoxides .",
    "the complexity of this compound can be considered in terms of the energy scales that are involved in the electronic structure and magnetism of these oxides .",
    "these include the @xmath0 bandwidth w , an intra - atomic coulomb repulsion strength u , an intra - atomic @xmath3 exchange energy ( hund s rule j , or exchange splitting @xmath4 ) , the crystal field splitting @xmath5 , and the charge transfer energy @xmath6 ( the difference in mean mn @xmath0 and o @xmath1 site energies ) . in the magnetically ordered antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state , there are further symmetry lowering and ligand field subsplittings involving @xmath7 hybridization .",
    "all of these scales change as the volume changes , making the pressure - driven mott transition a challenging phenomenon to describe .",
    "although the objective of the current paper is to compare methods within the fcc ( rocksalt ) phase , it is useful first to recount what is known about the mott transition at this time . the current experimental information , mostly at room temperature , on the behavior of mno under pressure is summarized in fig .",
    "[ mnophasediagram ] .",
    "resistance measurements@xcite provided the first evidence of the mott transition in mno near @xmath8 gpa .",
    "recent x - ray diffraction and emission spectroscopy measurements of the crystal structure and magnetic moment by yoo _",
    "et al._@xcite have clarified the behavior .",
    "around 90 gpa there is a structural transformation from the distorted b1 ( rocksalt ) phase to the b8 ( nias ) structure .",
    "this structure change is followed at 105 gpa by the mott transition , consisting of a simultaneous volume collapse and moment collapse signifying a qualitative change in the electronic structure of the compound .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "little is known about how the mott transition occurs in a real multiband tmo in spite of the extensive studies of the mott transition in the single - band hubbard model , which has a simple spin - half moment at strong coupling and half - filling .",
    "the numerous energy scales listed above , and the s=@xmath9 moment on mn arising from the five @xmath0 electrons , allow many possibilities for how the moment might disintegrate as the effective repulsion decreases .",
    "the high pressure limit is clear : a nonmagnetic @xmath7 band metal in which kinetic energy overwhelms potential energy .",
    "this is the competition studied in the ( simplified ) hubbard model .",
    "the multiband nature has attracted little attention until recently , when for example the question of possible orbital - selective mott transitions@xcite have aroused interest .",
    "one can imagine one scenario of a cascade of moment reductions s = @xmath10 before complete destruction of magnetism , as electrons use their freedom to flip spins ( as some competing energy overcomes hund s rule , for example ) .",
    "in such a scenario there is the question of which orbital flips its spin at each spinflip , which involves a question of orbital selection and ordering .",
    "at each flip the system loses exchange ( potential ) energy while gaining kinetic energy ( or correlation energy through ` singlet ' formation ) .",
    "the manner in which kinetic energy changes is difficult to estimate because subband involvement means that there is no longer a single bandwidth w that is involved .",
    "the increasing hybridization with o @xmath1 states under pressure strongly affects the kinetic energy , directly and through superexchange ( a kinetic energy effect ) .",
    "it is known that conventional band theory ( local density approximation [ lda ] ) that does so well for so many materials gives poor results for @xmath0 monoxides in many respects , and some predictions are qualitatively incorrect ( _ viz .",
    "_ no band gap when there should be a large gap of several ev ) .",
    "thus even at the density functional level ( ground state energy , density , and magnetization ) some correlated approach is required . in the past fifteen years several approaches , which we refer to as correlated band theories , have been put forward , and each has had its successes in providing an improved description of some aspects of correlated tmos . although commonly called mean - field approaches with which they share many similarities , they are not mean - field treatments of any many - body hamiltonian .",
    "rather , they are energy functionals based on the complete many - body hamiltonian , which must then be approximated due to limited knowledge of the exchange - correlation functional .    in this paper , we provide a close comparison of certain results from four such methods : full potential lda+u , the hybrid exchange functional ( hse ) approach , the self - interaction - corrected local spin - density method ( sic - lsd ) , and a nonlocal pseudopotential - like variation of sic ( pseudo - sic ) . our main focus is to compare the predicted changes in energy , moment , and volume within the afmii rocksalt phase of mno . to keep the comparison manageable",
    "we confine our attention to the rocksalt phase , since our emphasis is on comparison of methods and not yet the ultimate but more daunting task of modeling structural changes that may precede , or accompany , the mott transition .",
    "rocksalt mno has an experimental equilibrium lattice constant @xmath11=4.45    ( cubic cell volume v@xmath12=88.1  @xmath13 ) .",
    "density functional theory , like hartree - fock theory , deals in its most straightforward form with ground state properties , _",
    "i.e. _ zero temperature .",
    "the ground state is known to be the afmii phase in which @xmath14 layers have spins aligned , and successive layers are antiparallel .",
    "the resulting symmetry is rhombohedral , with mn@xmath15 and mn@xmath16 being distinct sites ( although related through a translation + spin - flip operation ) .",
    "thus , while most of the lore about transition metal monoxides is based upon cubic symmetry of the mn ( and o ) ion , in the ordered state the electronic symmetry is reduced .",
    "it is obvious that individual wavefunctions will be impacted by this symmetry , _ viz . _",
    "fourfold symmetry around the cubic axes is lost .",
    "it has been emphasized by massidda _",
    "et al._@xcite that zone - integrated , and even spin - integrated , quantities show the effects of this symmetry lowering ; for example , born effective charges lose their cubic symmetry .",
    "since this issue arises in the interpretation of our results , we provide some background here .    in cubic symmetry",
    "the mn @xmath0 states split into the irreducible representations ( irreps ) denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "rhombohedral site symmetry results in the three irreducible representations @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , the latter two being two fold degenerate .",
    "the coordinate rotation from cubic to rhombohedral ( superscript @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively ) is , with a specific choice for the orientation of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 axes in the rhombohedral system , @xmath26 applying this rotation of coordinates gives the @xmath0 orbitals in the rhombohedral frame in terms of those in the cubic frame ( @xmath27 ) : @xmath28    in rhombohedral coordinates it is useful to categorize the @xmath0 orbitals in terms of their orbital angular momentum projections along the rhombohedral axis : @xmath29",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ; @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath34 specifies groups of states that only transform into combinations of themselves under trigonal point group operations .",
    "note that the unique @xmath19 symmetry state in rhombohedral coordinates is the fully symmetric combination of the cubic @xmath17 states .",
    "the other two irreps are both @xmath18 doublets .",
    "while @xmath35 and @xmath36 form representations of these irreps , if there are components of the crystal field that are not diagonal in the l=(2,@xmath37 ) basis , these states will mix . then each of the resulting ( orthonormal )",
    "irreps @xmath20 , and @xmath21 will contain both @xmath35 and @xmath36 components .",
    "such mixing does occur in mno and complicates the symmetry characterization of the @xmath0 states .",
    "for lda band structure plot ( fig .",
    "[ ldabands ] ) we used version 5.20 of the full - potential local orbital band structure method ( fplo@xcite ) .",
    "relativistic effects were incorporated on a scalar - relativistic level .",
    "we used a single numerical basis set for the core states ( mn @xmath38 and o @xmath39 ) and a double numerical basis set for the valence sector including two @xmath40 and @xmath0 radial functions , and one @xmath41 radial function , for mn , and two @xmath42 and @xmath1 radial functions , and one @xmath0 radial function , for o. the semi core states ( mn @xmath43 ) are treated as valence states with a single numerical radial function per @xmath44-shell .",
    "the local density exchange - correlation functional pw92 of perdew and wang@xcite was used .",
    "the lda+u approach of including correlation effects is to ( 1 ) identify the correlated orbital , @xmath0 in this case , ( 2 ) augment the lda energy functional with a hubbard - like term ( coulomb repulsion u ) and hund s ( exchange j ) energy between like spins , ( 3 ) subtract off a spin - dependent average of this interaction energy to keep from double - counting repulsions ( once in lda fashion , once in this u term ) , and ( 4 ) include the correlated orbital occupation numbers in the self - consistency procedure , which leads to an orbital - dependent hartree - fock - like potential acting on the correlated orbitals .",
    "the addition to the energy functional has the schematic form @xmath45 . \\label{ldau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we actually use the coordinate - system independent form of lsda+u @xcite implemented in fplo,@xcite which leads to four @xmath46 indices on @xmath47 and @xmath48 which for simplicity have not been displayed ( nor has the full off - diagonal form of the occupation matrices @xmath49 ) .",
    "this treatment of the on - site interactions @xmath47 and @xmath48 incorporates on - site correlation effects in the mn 3d - shell .",
    "we have used the so called ` atomic - limit ' ( strong local moment ) form of the double - counting correction , the last term in eq .",
    "this form is appropriate for the high - spin state , but it is less obviously so for the low - spin state that is found at reduced volumes .",
    "the slater parameters were chosen according to @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . + the shape of the basis orbitals has been optimized yielding a sufficient accuracy of the total energy over the range of geometries considered in this work .",
    "the @xmath53-integrals are performed via the tetrahedron method with an irreducible mesh corresponding to 1728 ( @xmath54 ) points in the full brillouin zone .",
    "the sic - lsd method addresses the unphysical self - interaction in the lda treatment of localized states .",
    "itinerant states , being spread over space without finite density in any given region , do not experience this self - interaction within the lda treatment .",
    "should there be localized states , confined to some region and giving a finite density , they will suffer an unphysical self - interaction in the lsd method .",
    "this issue then clearly arises in the itinerant - localized transition in mno and other correlated systems .",
    "the basic premise of the sic - lsd method is that localized electrons should experience a different potential from that of itinerant electrons,@xcite analogous to that of an atomic state whose self - interaction must be removed .",
    "then electrons on the surrounding atoms are allowed to accommodate self - consistently .",

    "since the correction vanishes for itinerant states , the sum finally includes only the self - consistently localized states .",
    "the localized and itinerant states are expanded in the same basis set , and minimization becomes a process of optimizing the coefficients in the expansion of the states ( as other band structure methods do , except that bloch character is imposed in other methods ) .",
    "the implementation of temmerman and collaborators@xcite used here incorporates the atomic - sphere approximation ( asa ) of the linear muffin - tin orbital electronic structure method@xcite ( lmto ) in the tight - binding representation.@xcite further details can be found in ref . .      the large computing requirements ( compared to lda ) of the sic - lsd method , even for materials with small unit cells ,",
    "has led to an alternative approach @xcite , in which the self - interaction part of the kohn - sham potential is approximated by a non - local , atomic - like contribution included within the pseudopotential construction .",
    "the original implementation of this scheme has given important improvements over lsda results for non - magnetic ii - vi and iii - v semiconductors , but was not applicable to metals or to magnetic and highly - correlated systems where there is a coexistence of strongly localized and hybridized electron charges .",
    "the pseudopotential self - interaction corrected calculations presented here were performed using the recently developed `` pseudo - sic '' method of filippetti and spaldin @xcite .",
    "this pseudo - sic approach represents a compromise between the fully self - consistent implementations of svane _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and the alternative method of vogel et al .",
    "@xcite , in that the sic calculated for the atom ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is scaled by the electron occupation numbers calculated self - consistently within the crystal environment .",
    "this allows the sic coming from localized , hybridized , or completely itinerant electrons to be discriminated , and permits the treatment of metallic as well as insulating compounds , with minimal computational overhead beyond the lsda . in this pseudo - sic procedure ,",
    "the orbital sic potential is taken from the isolated neutral atom and included in the crystal potential in terms of a nonlocal projector , similar in form to the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential .",
    "the bloch wave functions are projected onto the basis of the pseudo - atomic orbitals , then , for each projection , the potential acting on the bloch state is corrected by an amount corresponding to the atomic sic potential .",
    "note that , within this formalism , a physically meaningful energy functional which is related to the kohn - sham equations by a variational principle is not available .",

    "+      the hybrid - exchange dft approximation mixes a fraction of the exact , non - local , exchange interaction ( which uses the hartree - fock [ hf ] expression ) with the local , or semi - local , exchange energy of the lda or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",

    "the origin , and the proper description , of the moments and the band gaps in transition metal monoxides have a long history . the earliest question centered on the connection between the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order and the insulating behavior .",
    "band picture@xcite could account in a one - electron manner for a gap arising from afm order , whereas mott s picture of correlation - induced insulating behavior@xcite was a many - body viewpoint with insulating behavior not connected to the magnetic order .",

    "kotani implemented@xcite the `` dft exact - exchange '' method of talman and shadwick@xcite to crystal calculations .",
    "this method consists of taking the fock expression for the exchange energy in the dft functional , then performing a kohn - sham solution ( minimization ) , giving a local exchange potential ( `` optimized effective potential '' ) . in kotani",

    "their corrections were built on a parametrized tight - binding representation , and they obtained small self - energy corrections for mno , much smaller than they obtained for the other transition metal monoxides .    the effective potential approach used by kotani",
    "was extended by solovyev and terakura@xcite in an unconventional way .",

    "neither the b3lyp nor the pbe0 approximation can be applied to the metallic side of the transition of interest here . for that",
    ", we must turn to the screened hybrid - exchange of hse .    therefore , while there has been thorough lda studies of mno and a variety of approaches to treatment of the correlation problem , nearly all of these have considered only ambient pressure or small variations of volume near zero pressure .",

    "i.e. _ when it is possible to obtain that state self - consistently , as opposed to when it becomes the stable solution ( which was discussed in the eos subsection )",
    ". the state is obtained already at ambient volume in the hse method ; the pseudo - sic method obtains the low - spin state just below @xmath105 ; for the lda+u method , it was not followed above @xmath103 .",
    "it should be emphasized however that no concerted measures were taken to try to follow all solutions to the limit of their stability .      in fig .",
    "[ gapvsa ] the calculated band gap of both high - spin and low - spin states are shown for all methods . here",
    "the behavior differs considerably between the methods , in part because at certain volumes the gap lies between different bands for some of the methods . at ambient pressure",
    "the pseudo - sic and hse methods obtain a gap of 3.5 - 4 ev , while that for sic - lsd is 2.9 ev , and that of the lda+u method is even lower , less than 2 ev .",
    "experimental values lie in the 3.8 - 4.2 ev range . referring to fig .",
    "2 , it can be observed that the large volume gap depends on the position of the majority @xmath0 states with respect to the free - electron - like band , _",
    "i.e. _ it is not the @xmath106 mott gap . both of the former approaches show only a slight increase as pressure is applied , reaching a maximum around @xmath107 where a band crossing results in a decreasing gap from that point . for pseudo - sic",
    ", there is an almost immediate collapse to a metallic low spin state . within hse",
    ", mno collapses to the low - spin state at a volume @xmath108 , coincident with the closing of the gap in the low - spin state .",
    "the sic - lsd and lda+u gaps , smaller initially , show a much stronger increase with pressure , and also incur the band crossover that leads to decrease of the gap ( within the high - spin state ) .",
    "in this section we analyze the character of the states just above and just below the mott transition , as predicted by each of the methods . due to the differing capabilities of the codes",
    ", the quantities used for analysis will not be identical in all cases . in the figs .",
    "6 - 9 we present for uniformity the dos in the high volume phase at the equilibrium volume ( @xmath109 ) and in the collapsed phase at @xmath110 ( @xmath93=0.6 ) .",
    "note ( from table i ) that this specific volume does not correspond to any specific feature in the phase diagram for any method , although it lies in the general neighborhood of the volume at the collapse .",
    "changes within the collapsed phase are continuous , however , so the plots at @xmath110 are representative of the collapsed phase .",
    "the projected doss ( pdoss ) in fig . [ ldaudos ] refer to projections onto mn @xmath0 orbitals , with the @xmath111-axis being the rhombohedral axis , the @xmath19 @xmath112 ( @xmath113=0 ) state ; the @xmath114 pair \\{@xmath115 } ( @xmath113=1 ) ; and the @xmath18 pair \\{@xmath116 } ( @xmath113=2 ) .",
    "because the two @xmath18 representations have the same symmetry , they can mix and the actual combinations @xmath117 are orthogonal linear combinations of @xmath118 which depend on interactions .",
    "for the lda+u results , however , there is little mixing of the @xmath118 pairs .",
    "the character of the transition is simple to describe : the @xmath114 pair ( @xmath113=1 with respect to the rhombohedral axis ) simply flips its spin .",
    "this s=@xmath101 state is unexpected and quite unusual .",
    "first , each @xmath0 orbital is still singly occupied , verified by plotting the charge density on the mn ion and finding it just as spherical as for the high - spin state .",
    "second , each @xmath0 orbital is essentially fully spin - polarized , with the configuration being @xmath119 .",
    "a plot of the spin density@xcite reveals the unanticipated strong anisotropy with nodal character , characteristic of spin - up @xmath120 and @xmath113=2 orbitals , and spin - down @xmath113=1 orbitals ( in the rhombohedral frame ) .",
    "third , it makes this transition with essentially zero change in the gap , which is 3.5 ev .",
    "the band structure changes completely , however , so the close similarity of the gaps on either side is accidental .      in the high volume phase the distribution and overall width of the occupied @xmath0 states , shown in fig .",
    "[ hsedos ] , is similar to that of the lda+u method ( previous subsection ) .",
    "the gap is larger , as discussed earlier .",
    "the collapsed phase shows new characteristics .",
    "the gap collapses from 4 ev at @xmath109 to essentially zero at the onset of the collapsed phase at @xmath93=0.55 , making this an insulator - to - semimetal transition .",
    "the metallic phase then evolves continuously as the pressure is increased beyond @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath0 configuration can be characterized as @xmath121 , resulting in a moment of 1@xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding spin density is strongly anisotropic , although in a different manner than is the case for lda+u .      the spin - decomposed spectrum from this method is shown in fig .",
    "[ psicdos ] , symmetry - projected as done above for the lda+u method .",
    "the pdoss in the high - spin state are quite similar to those given by the lda+u method",
    ". the transition could hardly be more different , however .",
    "the gap collapses in an insulator - to - good - metal character , the fermi level lying within both majority and minority bands .",
    "the majority bands are the @xmath114 pair ( @xmath113=1 ) and are only slightly occupied . in the minority bands",
    "both @xmath18 and @xmath114 are roughly quarter filled .",
    "the reason this solution is ( at least locally ) stable seems clear : e@xmath122 falls in a deep valley in the minority dos .    in the collapsed , low - spin state , the @xmath19 orbital of both spins",
    "is occupied , and the majority @xmath18 pair is also fully occupied .",
    "this results in a configuration that can be characterized roughly as @xmath123 , giving spin @xmath124 thus the fact that the same moment is found in the low - spin state as was found with the lda+u and pseudo - sic methods seems accidental , because in those methods the energy gap required integer moment whereas the pseudo - sic solution is firmly metallic .",
    "it is in fact close to half metallic , which accounts for the near - integer moment . in pseudo - sic ,",
    "the @xmath19 orbital is unpolarized ( spin - paired ) , the @xmath18 pair \\{@xmath115 } ( @xmath113=1 ) is positively polarized , and the @xmath114 pair \\{@xmath116 } ( @xmath113=2 ) is negatively polarized but to a smaller degree .",
    "this method give much more tightly bound @xmath0 state in the high - spin state than the other methods .",
    "an associated feature is that the majority - minority splitting , the `` effective u''@xmath125 plus the exchange splitting 13 ev , more than twice as la large as used in the lda+u method ( both in this paper and elsewhere ) .",
    "note that in the sic - lsd method @xmath126 is a true slater self - coulomb integral , whereas in the lda+u method the value of @xmath47 represents the ( somewhat screened ) coulomb interaction between a @xmath0 electron and an _ additional _",
    "@xmath0 electron , so agreement between the two is not expected .",
    "nevertheless the difference is striking . all five majority @xmath0 states",
    "are localized , leading to the self - interaction potential that binds them .",
    "the majority @xmath0 states lie 6 ev below the center of the @xmath1 bands and hybridize very weakly , which accounts for the very narrow , almost core - like @xmath0 bands .    in the collapsed phase",
    ", there are no localized states and the usual lsda results re - emerges .",
    "all @xmath0 states make some contribution to the moment , but the strongest contribution arises from the @xmath19 orbital .",
    "one might argue in the lda+u result that the net moment arises from the @xmath19 orbital ( with the moments arising from the @xmath18 and @xmath114 orbital canceling ) .",
    "however , the electronic structure in the collapsed phase of this sic - lsd method is very different from that of the lda+u method .",
    "the results of four correlated band methods ",
    "lda+u , sic - lsd , pseudo - sic , and hse  have been compared for the equation of state ( for both normal and collapsed phases ) , electronic structure ( including @xmath0 configuration ) , and the mn moment under pressure . in order to make the comparison as straightforward as possible ,",
    "the crystal structure was kept cubic ( rocksalt ) . to compare seriously with experiment",
    ", one must account for the coupling of the afm order to the structure , because this results in a substantial rhombohedral distortion of the lattice.@xcite then structural transitions ( particularly to the b8 phase ) must also be considered .    the large volume , high - spin phases are qualitatively the same for the various functionals : afm with a fully - polarized @xmath127 configuration . due to the large charge transfer energy ,",
    "the configuration remains @xmath128 at all volumes studied here .",
    "the predicted equations of state ( which give the equilibrium volume , bulk modulus , and its pressure derivative ) show rather strong variation , suggesting that the extension of the mn @xmath0 and o @xmath1 functions , or their hybridization , differ substantially even in this large volume phase .",
    "of course , since the functionals are different , any given density would lead to different energies .    under pressure ,",
    "the gap initially increases ( all methods give this behavior ) , and the system suffers a first - order transition ( isostructural , by constraint ) to a collapsed phase where hybridization must be correspondingly stronger . uniformly among the methods , the moment collapse reflects an s=@xmath9 to s=@xmath101 transition , rigorously so for the lda+u method for which the collapsed phase retains a gap , and less rigorously so for the the other methods where the collapsed phase is metallic .",
    "it is remarkable that none of the methods gives a collapse to a nonmagnetic state , which probably would be the most common expectation .",
    "this s=@xmath129 moment collapse is related in some cases to the local symmetry of the mn @xmath0 orbitals in the afm phase ( being most obvious for the lda+u results of fig . [ ldaudos ] ) .",
    "the symmetry is @xmath130 , _",
    "i.e. _ a singlet and two doublets per spin direction . without further symmetry - breaking ( orbital ordering )",
    "an s=@xmath131 transition requires a single spin flip , which could only be the @xmath19 spin .",
    "however , the @xmath19 state is more tightly bound than as least one of the two doublets both for lda+u ( fig .",
    "[ ldaudos ] ) and for pseudo - sic ( fig .",
    "[ psicdos ] ) . in lda+u",
    "the @xmath18 doublet flips its spin , while in pseudo - sic the @xmath19 singlet flips its spin leaving the minority @xmath18 and @xmath114 doublets partially occupied and therefore metallic .",
    "this symmetry - related behavior depends of course on the magnetic ordering that gives rise to the ( electronic ) rhombohedral symmetry . above the nel temperature ,",
    "the moment collapse at the mott transition may proceed differently because the mn moment would lie at a site of ` cubic ' symmetry ( a dynamic treatment could include the effect of short range spin correlations ) .",
    "our study provides some of the first detailed information on how magnetic moments in a real material may begin to disintegrate without vanishing identically , at or near a mott transition , when correlation is taken into account .",
    "it is accepted that dynamic processes will be required for a truly realistic picture of the mott ( insulator - to - metal ) transition . however , a moment collapse between two insulating phases ( as described here by two of the methods ) may be described reasonably by a correlated band ( static ) approach .    beyond this similar amount of moment collapse ,",
    "the four functionals give substantially different collapsed phases : differences in the mn @xmath0 magnetic configuration ( although all remain @xmath128 ) and differences in conducting versus insulating behavior .",
    "it is not surprising therefore that the collapsed - phase equations of state differ considerably between the methods .",
    "the differences in predictions can be traced , in principle , to the different ways in which exchange and correlation are corrected with respect to lda .",
    "one clear shortcoming of lda is in the local approximation to the exchange energy .",
    "the hse method deals with this problem directly , by using 25% hartree - fock exchange .",
    "the self - interaction of the sic - lsd method is largely a self - exchange energy correction , subtracting out the spurious self - coulomb energy that occurs in the hartree functional if an orbital chooses to localize .",
    "a self-(local density ) correlation correction is also included in sic - lsd .",
    "the pseudo - sic method includes the same correction if applied to an atom , but in a crystal the pseudo - sic energy correction and change in potential takes a substantially different form , as the difference in predictions reflects .",
    "the lda+u method is rather different in this respect : it specifically does not subtract out any self - interaction ( although it is sometimes discussed in this way ) . in the form",
    "[ ldau ] of lda+u correction , the second term is simply an lda - like average of the first term .",
    "the on - site coulomb repulsion is treated hartree - fock like , leading to an orbital - dependent , occupation - dependent potential .",
    "each method has its own strengths , and each is only an anticipated improvement on lda toward a better , more general functional .",
    "it is expected that more details of the results may be published separately by the respective practitioners .",
