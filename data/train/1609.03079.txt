    "it is proposed that this frustration leads to a massive renormalisation of the bare parameters of the model such that the effective _ long - wavelength _ description is that of compact electrodynamics in its deconfining phase .    here , we propose a complementary view that allows to shed some light on this massive renormalisation and to make quantitative predictions that were previously not accessible . with the hindsight that the effective _ long - wavelength , low - energy _ description hosts gapless , linearly - dispersing collective photon excitation , in which the original , discrete , i.e. , quantum , nature of the participating spins is coarse - grained over , we propose a semi - classical large-@xmath14 description .",

    "the spin @xmath14 can then be tuned to 1/2 to obtain quantitative estimates of the relevant parameters .",
    "the success of this approach is a consequence of the rg flow to the fixed point at @xmath15 , so that at small momenta @xmath16 can be treated as a small parameter , and is analogous to the success of spin - wave description in spin-1/2 quantum ferromagnets .",
    "we have implicitly assumed the absence of other fixed points  because of the above mentioned _ frustration _ , the sytem is in the deconfining phase for all @xmath14 and the rg flow is controlled by the @xmath15 fixed point . note that it is the relevant gapless , long - wavelength modes that determine the rg flow to large @xmath14 , rather than the global broken symmetry _ per se_. to see this , it is particularly instructive to use a spin representation that , unlike holstein - primakoff or dyson - maleev , does not rely on a broken symmetry .",

    "a square - integrable approximation for @xmath45 or a continuum approximation for @xmath46 at this stage would be rather poor .",
    "however , if we have a large number @xmath47 of spins aligned along the @xmath42 axis and we are interested in the average @xmath48 or average @xmath49 of this ensemble ( coarse - graining ) , then by the central limit theorem , a gaussian approximation for these will work very well : @xmath50 and @xmath51 , regardless of the underlying distribution or its discreteness .",

    "we now shed a bit more light on the success of the large @xmath14 expansion by discussing the relevance of the successive terms in the hamiltonian in the long - wavelength limit . in the path - integral description of the hamiltonian in eq .  , the continuum - limit action is of the following form ( without loss of generality @xmath112 has been set to one ) @xmath113\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is a vector field and the quartic and higher order terms are included in @xmath115 , which is typical of the scaling properties of all the quartic terms in the hamiltonian ( see eq .  ) .",

    "the gaussian term dominates in all dimensions and higher order @xmath119 terms are irrelevant .",
    "the above scaling also shows that higher order terms in @xmath119 correspond to increasing orders in the @xmath16 expansion .",
    "naive scaling therefore leads to the conclusion that the @xmath16 expansion provides a good description of long - wavelength physics .    from the irrelevance of the quartic term",
    ", one also expects the damping of a photon above the ground state to be small .",
    "in fact , the decay of a single photon intro three photons ( caused by @xmath97 ) vanishes exactly in the relativistic part of the spectrum because of kinematic constraints .",
    "we have shown that dynamical spin - wave interactions are irrelevant for low energy physics .",
    "the gaussian term dominates the action , which corresponds to neglecting _ normal ordered _ terms in the quartic contribution eq .  , and higher order .",
    "the renormalised quadratic hamiltonian ( i.e. , after hartree fock corrections have been added to it ) should give us good estimates for long - distance correlators .",
    "now that we have satisfied ourselves that dynamical spin - wave interactions are negligible , one can also try to address the issue of kinematic spin - wave interactions arising from the fact that @xmath21 .",
    "here , it proves very instructive to consider the overlap of a particular spin configuration with the ground state @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a particular eigenstate of @xmath122 .",
    "firstly , in the limit @xmath123 , zero - point fluctuations disappear and the ground state becomes an unweighted ( for @xmath124 ) superposition of all states that satisfy the spin ice rules , i.e. those where @xmath125 for all @xmath64 . for @xmath4 this would correspond to the rk state . as we make @xmath14 finite , zero - point fluctuations have the strongest effect on the low lying @xmath64 states , where the weights vanish non - perturbatively because @xmath126 . it is this divergence of @xmath127 which dominates the long - wavelength physics and is for instance responsible for the disappearance of pinch - points as @xmath14 becomes finite and we move away from the rk state .",
    "one could therefore exclude the high fourier components of @xmath128 from the weights in eq .",
    ", since the effect on low - energy physics is negligible  it is for these high fourier components that the kinematic bound on the microscopic spins is also highly relevant . for low @xmath64 components , on the other hand , the spins can be coarse - grained into large effective spins of typical size @xmath129 and the bound becomes irrelevant .",
    "we have developed a semi - classical description that accurately captures the properties of quantum spin ice at large length scales , and allows for a systematic , perturbative expansion which in principle can be truncated at arbitrary order .",

    "our results are in good quantitative agreement with recent numerical calculations in ref .  .",
    "we find that hartree - fock corrections , due to photon - photon interactions , that go beyond the quadratic u(1 ) lattice gauge theory , significantly renormalise the speed of light and give rise to a small splitting in the energy of the two photon modes at intermediate wavevectors .",
