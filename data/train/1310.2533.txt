    "the shape - recovery process , i.e. the thermally driven transition from the low temperature phase ( martensite ) into the high - temperature phase ( austenite ) , is a fundamental part of the shape - memory effect . for many shape - memory alloys ,",
    "the critical temperature for initiation of the shape - recovery process is strongly dependent on the microstructure of martensite entering the transition .",
    "when the heating is applied on a thermally induced martensitic microstructure obtained by the stress - free cooling of the austenitic phase , the transition starts at a certain temperature , usually denoted as @xmath0 ( austenite start ) .",
    "however , if the material in the martensitic phase is , prior to the heating , deformed ( i.e. if the microstructure is reoriented by application of external mechanical loads ) , this critical temperature can be shifted significantly upwards .",
    "this effect is called the mechanical stabilization of martensite and has been documented for both single crystals and polycrystalline shape - memory alloys ( smas ) @xcite .",
    "the difference between the shape - recovery process from the mechanically stabilized martensite and from the thermally induced martensitic microstructure was clearly illustrated by acoustic emission ( ae ) measurements by landa et al . @xcite .",
    "the ae method is based on detecting and counting the number of acoustic signals emitted by the material during the course of the transition ( see @xcite for an example of the use of ae for characterization of the martensitic transitions in smas ) . fig .",
    "[ fig1_hs ] ( taken from @xcite with courtesy of m. landa ) gives an illustrative example of the comparison of ae records obtained for the same single crystal of the cu - al - ni alloy undergoing the transition in these two different regimes .",
    "for the thermally induced microstructure , more than 90% of ae events occur in a temperature range between the austenite start temperature @xmath0 and the austenite finish temperature @xmath1 , which is in agreement with dsc measurements for the same material .",
    "the transition in this temperature interval is preceded by a small number of events ( less than 10% ) appearing below @xmath0 .",
    "these events can be ascribed to the formation of nuclei of austenite in the thermally induced martensitic microstructure . above @xmath0 ,",
    "these nuclei grow successively through the material and provide the transition . for the stabilized martensite , more than 90% of the events",
    "are recorded within a very narrow temperature interval . as observed by seiner et al .",
    "@xcite , the transition from the mechanically stabilized martensite is provided by the formation and propagation of special interfacial microstructures , which interpolate between austenite and mechanically stabilized martensite ensuring the kinematically compatible connection between them .",
    "these microstructures are able to exist and propagate in a wide range of temperatures and thermal gradients @xcite .",
    "thus , the ae record for the stabilized martensite can be interpreted as follows : the small number of ae events detected below the narrow interval corresponds to the nucleation of austenite .",
    "as soon as the nucleation barrier is overcome , the interfacial microstructure propagates abruptly through the specimen and no further increase of the temperature is necessary .",
    "this shows how essential the nucleation process is for the effect of mechanical stabilization and the shape - recovery process in general .",
    "this mechanical stabilization effect resulted in a rather surprising nucleation mechanism of austenite in a cu - al - ni single crystal . in a simplified setting",
    ", we provide a mathematical explanation for this mechanism , based on ideas of the modern calculus of variations .     and",
    "@xmath1 for the thermally induced microstructure ; ( b ) abrupt transition of the stabilized martensite within a narrow temperature interval .",
    "the 100% corresponds to @xmath210@xmath3 events . ]",
    "the observations that follow were made on a single crystal of cu - al - ni , prepared by the bridgeman method at the institute of physics , ascr .",
    "the specimen was a prismatic bar of dimensions 12@xmath43@xmath43mm@xmath5 in the austenite with edges approximately along the principal directions of the austenitic phase ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) .",
    "the martensite - to - austenite transition temperatures determined by dsc were @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath8 for the transition from the stabilized martensite induced by homogeneous heating for this specimen was @xmath960@xmath10c .",
    "this was estimated from optical observations of the transition in this specimen with one of its faces laid on and thermally contacted with a gradually heated peltier cell , using a heat conducting gel .",
    "the specimen was subjected to the following experimental procedure :    1 .   by unidirectional compression along its longest edge",
    ", the specimen was transformed into a single variant of mechanically stabilized 2h martensite . due to the mechanical stabilization effect",
    "the reverse transition did not occur during unloading .",
    "the specimen was then freely laid on a slightly pre - stressed , free - standing polyethylene ( pe ) foil ( thickness 10@xmath11 m , temperature resistance up to 140@xmath10c ) .",
    "this ensured that there were minimal mechanical constraints to the specimen during the observations .",
    "the specimen was locally heated by touching its surface with an ohmically heated tip of the solomon sl-30 ( digital ) soldering iron with temperature electronically controlled to be 200@xmath10c ( control accuracy @xmath12c ) , i.e. significantly above the @xmath0 and @xmath8 temperatures .",
    "the nucleation of austenite was optically observed and recorded by a conventional ccd camera ( 7@xmath4 optical zoom , 25 frames / second , pal resolution with ` mpeg ` compression ) .",
    "the localized heating was applied in three different ways : ( i ) with the tip touching one of the corners surrounding the upper face ; ( ii ) with the tip touching one of the edges , approximately in the middle between two corners ; ( iii ) with the tip touching approximately at the centre of the upper face .",
    "these experiments were repeated for various orientations of the specimens , i.e. with various faces chosen to be the upper ( observed ) ones .",
    "when heating was applied at a corner , the nucleation was always induced exactly at that corner and occurred nearly immediately after touching the specimen with the tip .",
    "when heating either an edge or the centre of the upper face , the nucleation occurred at one of the corners as well , i.e. the localized heating did not result in formation of the nucleus under the tip .",
    "moreover , the nucleus was only observable after 30 - 60 s , which was enough time for the corner to reach the @xmath8 temperature . in different tests",
    "the nuclei were observed at different corners ( including those lying on the pe foil ) and the exact choice was probably governed by imperfections of the stabilized martensite .",
    "after the nucleation , the transition front formed and propagated through the specimen . the velocity of the transition front probably depended on the actual overheating of the specimen .",
    "for some runs of the experiment , it propagated at a few millimetres per second ( comparable to the transition front propagating in a thermal gradient @xcite ) ; for other runs , the whole specimen transformed fully within less than one second .",
    "this also supports the conjecture that the nucleation is affected by the local microstructure in the corners : if the nucleation barrier in one of the corners is lowered e.g. by imperfections in the stabilized martensite , the nucleation occurs earlier ( i.e. at a lower temperature ) and the transition front , which lowers the temperature of the material by the latent heat @xcite , propagates more slowly .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3_hs ] , snapshots from the observations are seen ( link:[link to recorded video ] ) .",
    "the transition fronts have morphologies of the interfacial microstructures described in @xcite ( @xmath13 and @xmath14interfaces ) , in which the mechanically stabilized martensite is separated from austenite by a twinned region ensuring kinematical compatibility .",
    "the general nonlinear elasticity model  @xcite , which neglects interfacial energy , leads to the prediction of infinitely fine microstructures which are identified with limits of infimizing sequences @xmath15 , @xmath16 , for a total free energy @xmath17 here , @xmath18 represents the reference configuration of undistorted austenite at the critical temperature @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes the deformed position of the particle @xmath21 . the free - energy function",

    "however , information about the gradients of minimizing sequences @xmath36 for @xmath37 is lost in the limit @xmath38 and a more convenient way to describe microstructure is via the use of gradient young measures , which are families of probability measures @xmath39 generated by sequences of gradients @xmath40 .",

    "a specific construction shows that for the cu - al - ni specimen of this paper and some corners ( see @xcite for details ) there exists a measure @xmath132 such that @xmath131 . in this construction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : min_corner ] ) the measure @xmath43 takes the value @xmath170 in a small region at a corner , for some @xmath171 .",
    "the rotation @xmath28 can itself form a compatible interface with a simple laminate as in fig .  [",
    "fig : laminate ] with @xmath172 and @xmath173 for some variant chosen to form the interface with @xmath28 .",
    "this laminate can trivially also form a compatible interface with a pure phase of the variant @xmath90 and serves as the interfacial microstructure interpolating between @xmath28 ( austenite ) and @xmath90 making the entire microstructure compatible .",
    "note that since the measure @xmath43 is supported on @xmath174 it must indeed lower the energy .",
    "then , theorem  [ thm : main ] combined with the existence of an admissible measure in @xmath121 that lowers the energy imply that nucleation must , and does , occur at a corner .",
    "for a general energy functional of the form @xmath175 known necessary conditions for a map @xmath99 to be a local minimizer are that @xmath176 is quasiconvex at @xmath177 for all @xmath178 in the interior - quasiconvexity in the interior ( meyers @xcite ) - and at the boundary ( faces ) of @xmath18 - quasiconvexity at the boundary ( ball and marsden @xcite ) .",
    "recently , grabovsky and mengesha  @xcite showed that , along with the satisfaction of the euler - lagrange equations and the positivity of the second variation , strengthened versions of the quasiconvexity conditions are in fact sufficient for @xmath99 to be a local minimizer ; however , they showed this under smoothness assumptions on @xmath176 and also on the domain @xmath18 which do not allow for edges or corners .    in our work , the condition that @xmath179 is the appropriate expression of quasiconvexity at @xmath90 in the interior ( resp . on faces , edges and corners ) .",
    "then a way of interpreting theorem  [ thm : main ] is that @xmath176 is quasiconvex at @xmath90 in the interior , at the boundary ( faces ) and edges but not at corners , so that @xmath180 is a local minimizer in the interior , on faces and edges with respect to the localized variations defined before .",
    "we note that , to the best of the authors knowledge , quasiconvexity conditions at edges and corners have not been considered before ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the sets @xmath181 and @xmath182 depend on the specific change of symmetry of the crystal lattice and , hence , on the lattice parameters of the material . for a range of parameters ( see @xcite for details ) , including those of the specimen studied here , the above sets have explicit representations making our result applicable to a variety of parallelepipeds ; for @xmath183 these are given by @xmath184 @xmath185 whereas for @xmath186 and @xmath187 we simply interchange @xmath188 with @xmath189 and @xmath190 respectively . in particular , our result applies to the cu - al - ni specimen of this paper for any @xmath122 .",
    "however , for these lattice parameters , @xmath129 does not exhaust the unit sphere .",
    "hence our result leaves open the possibility that for different specimens nucleation could occur at a face or an edge .",
    "it is worth noting that the same nucleation mechanism was observed for a cu - al - ni specimen stabilized as a compound twin .",
    "this microstructure is also not able to form directly compatible interfaces with austenite and our methods may be applicable to this case as well .",
    "lastly , similar situations in which the incompatibility of gradients results in hysterisis have been documented before in different contexts , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "there , though in a different way , the mathematical analysis argues that despite the existence of a state with lower energy than a certain martensitic variant , it is necessarily geometrically incompatible with it , giving rise to an energy barrier which keeps the specific martensitic state stable . in general , in the context of microstructure formation , the incompatibility of gradients gives rise to very rich and interesting phenomena , such as the first genuinely non - classical austenite - martensite interfaces observed by seiner and landa  @xcite , where austenite was able to form stress - free interfaces with a double laminate of martensite . in @xcite , the reader can find further details as well as a relevant mathematical analysis .",
