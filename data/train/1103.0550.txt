    "the top quark is the heaviest elementary particle known to date . since its mass @xmath7  gev @xcite is on the order of the electroweak scale , the top quark is a crucial tool in the study of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "the top - quark mass is an important input parameter in electroweak fits @xcite , and plays a role in the investigation of many beyond the standard model ( bsm ) scenarios .",
    "the dominant top - quark production mechanism at hadron colliders is the simultaneous production of a top - anti - top pair .",
    "several differential distributions related to the production of top - quark pairs , such as the @xmath8 invariant - mass distribution and the transverse - momentum distributions for the top quark , allow to investigate the existence of possible heavy @xmath9-channel resonances @xcite predicted by many bsm scenarios .",
    "moreover , the rapidity distribution of the top quark can be used to directly calculate the forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron @xcite , an observable of much interest because of its potential sensitivity to new physics .",
    "so far , the best measurements of the top - quark mass , couplings , and production cross sections have been performed using tevatron data , where this particle was discovered in 1995 @xcite . in the last 15 years",
    "a few thousand top - quark pair events were studied by the cdf and d0 collaborations .",
    "the lhc is now running at a center - of - mass energy of 7  tev , and very recently the first measurements of the total pair - production cross section was performed by the cms @xcite and atlas @xcite collaborations .",
    "hopes are that it will be possible to obtain an integrated luminosity of up to 1fb@xmath10 , which would produce roughly 150,000 @xmath8 events before selection @xcite . with the planned increases in the center - of - mass energy and luminosity at the lhc , it will eventually be possible to observe millions of top quarks per year .",
    "the increase of the production rate will induce a decrease of the experimental errors on the measured observables . for the total inclusive cross section the relative experimental uncertainty",
    "is expected to become of the order of 5%10% @xcite .    in view of the precise measurements at the lhc and at the tevatron , it is crucial to obtain theoretical predictions for the measured observables which are as accurate as possible .",
    "the total pair - production cross section has been known at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) for over two decades @xcite .",
    "some time later also differential distributions @xcite and the forward - backward asymmetry @xcite were calculated to the same accuracy .",
    "as the nlo calculations suffer from uncertainties larger than @xmath11 , it would be desirable to extend them to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in a fixed - order expansion in the strong coupling constant .",
    "full nnlo predictions require the calculation of two sets of corrections : _",
    "i ) virtual corrections _ , which can be split into genuine two - loop diagrams @xcite and one - loop interference terms @xcite ; _ ii ) real radiation _ , which involves one - loop diagrams with the emission of one extra parton in the final state , and tree - level diagrams with two extra partons in the final state @xcite .",
    "in spite of progress made by several groups on different aspects of the nnlo calculations in the last few years , especially in developing a new subtraction scheme and calculating the contributions from double real radiation @xcite , a significant amount of work is still required to assemble all the elements .",
    "another way to improve on the fixed - order nlo calculation ( and also the nnlo one , upon its completion ) is to supplement it with threshold resummation @xcite .",
    "more precisely , one identifies a threshold parameter which vanishes in the limit where real gluon emission is soft , expands the result to leading power in this parameter , and uses renormalization - group ( rg ) methods to resum logarithmic corrections in this parameter to all orders in the strong coupling constant .",
    "for the total cross section , one such approach is to work in the threshold limit @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the partonic center - of - mass energy squared , and @xmath14 is approximately the velocity of the top ( or anti - top ) quark . in this production threshold limit",
    "the top quarks are produced nearly at rest and there are logarithmic terms of the form @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 ) , which can be resummed to all orders .",
    "this has been done to leading - logarithmic ( ll ) order @xcite , next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) order @xcite , and next - to - next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nnll ) order @xcite .",
    "note that in this case not only logarithmic corrections , but also coulomb corrections involving inverse powers of @xmath14 occur .",
    "an approach to all - orders resummation of coulomb terms can be found in @xcite .",
    "a drawback of this method is that it performs resummation of terms that become important in the region @xmath17 , which however gives a very small contribution to the total cross section . at the tevatron and lhc , typical values of @xmath14",
    "are in the range between 0.4 and 0.9 @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to perform the threshold expansion and resummation at the level of differential distributions , which are interesting in their own right , and to obtain the total cross section by integrating the results .",
    "one such method works with the top - pair invariant - mass distribution @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the invariant mass of the @xmath8 pair . the threshold limit for this case of pair - invariant - mass ( pim ) kinematics",
    "is defined as @xmath20 , and the corresponding threshold logarithms are of the form @xmath21_+$ ] ( with @xmath22 ) . in this limit",
    "only soft gluons can be emitted , but @xmath14 is a generic @xmath23 parameter , and the top - quark velocity need not be small .",
    "systematic resummation and fixed - order expansions of these logarithms has been studied in mellin moment space at nll order @xcite and recently also in momentum space at nnll order @xcite , using techniques from soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) . in general",
    ", it can be imagined that the approach based on differential distributions captures more contributions than the approach based on the small-@xmath14 expansion , and therefore gives more reliable predictions for the total cross section . in @xcite , we have argued that this is indeed the case .",
    "we also pointed out that in the effective - theory calculation the argument of the soft logarithms involves the ratio @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the energy of the soft radiation .",
    "this allowed us to identify a set of power - suppressed terms proportional to @xmath26 , and a numerical analysis showed that incorporating these terms in the fixed - order threshold expansion greatly improves the agreement between the approximated results in pim kinematics and the exact results , as was indeed expected based on previous studies of drell - yan @xcite and higgs production @xcite in scet .",
    "in addition to the invariant - mass distribution of the top - quark pair , the transverse - momentum and rapidity distributions of the top quark ( or anti - top quark ) are also interesting . in the case of distributions of the top quark ,",
    "one collects the anti - top quark and extra radiation into an inclusive hadronic state @xmath27 $ ] with total momentum @xmath28 , and defines the threshold limit as @xmath29 . in this limit of single - particle inclusive ( 1pi ) kinematics , only soft radiation is allowed , but as in pim kinematics the parameter @xmath14 is an @xmath30 quantity .",
    "soft gluon resummation for this case has been developed in mellin moment space @xcite and applied to the top - quark transverse - momentum distribution at nll order @xcite and recently also at nnll order @xcite , in the form of approximate nnlo predictions . starting from these distributions ,",
    "it is possible to obtain the total cross section by integrating over the kinematic variables .",
    "this approach has been taken in @xcite , and a large discrepancy from the results based on pim kinematics was found .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the results based on pim kinematics largely underestimate the cross section , while those based on 1pi kinematics more reasonably account for the higher - order corrections . in principle , in the threshold limit these two kinematics encode the same soft gluon physics .",
    "any differences between the two cases are due to power - suppressed corrections . at realistic collider energies , however , subleading terms are in general non - negligible , and one should study them carefully before drawing any definite conclusions . in light of the improved behavior of the pim expansion upon the inclusion of the @xmath26 terms observed in @xcite ,",
    "it is natural to ask whether including the analogous set of terms in 1pi kinematics has a similar effect , and if so , whether it can account for the discrepancies between the two types of kinematics observed in previous work .    in this paper , we extend our effective - field theory approach for pim kinematics to the case of 1pi distributions , performing an nlo+nnll resummation directly in momentum space , and also deriving approximate nnlo formulas equivalent to those from @xcite .",
    "we then apply these results to the transverse - momentum and rapidity distributions of the top quark , as well as the forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron . as in the case of pim kinematics , in the effective - theory formulation",
    "the soft threshold logarithms involve the ratio @xmath24 .",
    "this allows us to identify a set of power - suppressed terms proportional to @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is defined in ( [ eq : mandelstampart ] ) below and approaches zero in the threshold limit .",
    "through detailed studies of differential distributions and the total cross section , we show that although the power - suppressed terms in 1pi kinematics can be significant , including the set of power corrections identified through the effective field - theory techniques greatly improves the behavior of the 1pi threshold expansion in regions where the differential cross section is large .",
    "in fact , we find that the results for the total cross section at nlo+nnll and approximate nnlo are very much compatible within the two types of kinematics , as long as the extra terms appearing within the effective - theory analyses are included .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : kin ]",
    ", we review the kinematics of top - quark pair production in hadronic collisions and define the threshold regions in 1pi and pim kinematics .",
    "section  [ sec : scet ] contains the main new theoretical results of our work . in that section",
    "we explain how to extend the scet formalism to 1pi kinematics and assemble all of the perturbative ingredients needed for nlo+nnll and approximate nnlo predictions .",
    "this includes a calculation of the soft matching function at nlo in @xmath33 , which is a necessary ingredient for nnll resummation but was so far unknown .",
    "we also demonstrate how the extra subleading terms in the threshold expansion appear naturally in our formalism . in section  [ sec : numerical ] , we define the scheme needed to turn these theoretical results into numerical predictions .",
    "this includes not only a review of input parameters such at the top - quark mass and parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , but also a definition of the scheme used in evaluating the formulas at threshold .",
    "we then turn to numerical results in section  [ sec : threshold ] , performing a very detailed comparison of the 1pi results with exact results at nlo for the differential distributions , and also with the pim results at nlo and nnlo for the total cross section .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : pheno ] we give concrete results for the transverse - momentum and rapidity distributions , the forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron , and the total cross section , both at nlo+nnll and approximate nnlo .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our findings in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the scattering process @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 indicate the incoming protons ( lhc ) or proton and anti - proton ( tevatron ) , while @xmath37 represents an inclusive hadronic final state . in the born approximation ,",
    "two different production channels contribute to the scattering process ( [ eq : process ] ) : the quark - anti - quark annihilation and gluon - gluon fusion channels . at higher orders in the strong coupling constant , in addition to these two channels , there are also contributions from other partonic channels such as quark - gluon scattering .",
    "these additional channels are power suppressed in the partonic threshold region which we will define below , therefore we will not discuss them in this work .",
    "nevertheless we will include them in the numerical results when matching with fixed - order calculations .    the partonic processes which we will analyze in detail are",
    "thus @xmath38 note that the hadronic state @xmath39 in the above equations is different than the state @xmath37 in ( [ eq : process ] ) : @xmath39 contains only the products of the hard - scattering , while @xmath37 contains also the beam remnants from the initial hadrons .",
    "the relations between the hadronic and partonic momenta are @xmath40 and @xmath41 . at the hadronic level",
    ", we define the kinematic invariants as @xmath42 while the corresponding quantities at the partonic level are given by @xmath43 momentum conservation implies that at born level ( for @xmath44 ) we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "given the kinematic variables above , it is possible to define different threshold regions depending on the observables of interest .",
    "for example , in the case of the invariant - mass distribution of the top - quark pair , it is natural to define the threshold region as @xmath47 .",
    "this case , which is conventionally called pair invariant - mass ( pim ) kinematics , has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of single - particle inclusive ( 1pi ) observables such as the transverse - momentum or rapidity distribution of a single top quark , it is natural to define the threshold region as @xmath48 .",
    "this threshold limit was first studied in @xcite and is the subject of this work .",
    "it should be stressed that , in both the pim and 1pi threshold regions , the top and anti - top quarks are not forced to be nearly at rest .",
    "instead , the top - quark velocity @xmath49 is considered a generic @xmath30 parameter , neither close to zero nor close to unity , which is in fact the region of phase space where the differential cross section is largest @xcite .",
    "this differs from the situation encountered in many calculations of the total top - quark pair production cross section , which are carried out in the limit of vanishing top - quark velocity @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we will refer to the kinematic region where @xmath50 as the production threshold limit .",
    "note that at very large transverse momentum the top - quark velocity @xmath14 approaches 1 . to deal with such highly boosted top quarks would require a different type of effective theory , which has been developed in @xcite for @xmath51 collisions , but has not yet been extended to hadron colliders .",
    "the common link between these different threshold limits is that they in one way or another force the emitted real radiation to be soft .",
    "one uses this fact to define a partonic expansion parameter which vanishes in the exact threshold limit , where the energy of the soft radiation goes to zero , and calculates the partonic hard - scattering kernels as a threshold expansion in that parameter .",
    "however , unless restrictive kinematic cuts are applied , the convolution integral between the partonic hard - scattering kernels and pdfs is sensitive to kinematic regions where the partonic threshold parameter is not small . in that case ,",
    "power corrections to the threshold expansion can become important , and these have a different structure in each of the three limits mentioned above . in @xcite , we analyzed several advantages of calculations of the total cross section carried out in the partonic threshold limit for pim kinematics with respect to calculations based on the production threshold limit .",
    "similar considerations apply to the partonic threshold limit for 1pi kinematics , so when we discuss the total cross section in the present work we focus instead on a comparison between 1pi and pim .",
    "several phenomenologically interesting observables are related to the detection of a single particle rather than a pair , and 1pi kinematics is suitable to describe such observables . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the top - quark transverse - momentum and rapidity distributions , as well as on the total cross section .",
    "the double - differential cross section in the transverse momentum @xmath52 and the rapidity @xmath53 can be written in the factorized form @xmath54 where the @xmath55 are universal non - perturbative pdfs for the parton @xmath56 in the hadron @xmath57 , and the hard - scattering kernels @xmath58 are related to the partonic cross section and can be calculated perturbatively as series in the strong coupling constant .",
    "we define their expansion coefficients according to @xmath59 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hadronic mandelstam variables are related to @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the laboratory frame via @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "together with ( [ eq : mandelstampart ] ) , the kinematic variables entering @xmath58 can be expressed as functions of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the lower limits of integrations in ( [ eq : pt , y ] ) are @xmath64 finally , the total cross section can be calculated by integrating the double - differential distribution over the ranges @xmath65    in this paper we will mainly discuss the distributions of the top quark , but our results can also be applied to the transverse momentum @xmath66 and rapidity @xmath67 distributions of the anti - top quark after appropriate replacements . at the tevatron , charge - conjugation invariance of the strong interactions implies that within qcd we have the simple relation @xmath68 which we will use later on in interpreting the charge asymmetry in terms of a forward - backward asymmetry .    in the threshold limit @xmath69",
    "only the emission of soft radiation is allowed . in this",
    "limit calculations are greatly simplified , since one effectively deals with a two - body final state .",
    "the hard - scattering kernels can be factorized into a hard function @xmath70 and a soft function @xmath71 as @xmath72 + \\mathcal{o}(s_4 )    \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the notation above is meant to emphasize that there are ambiguities in the choice of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which can in general differ from the exact mandelstam variables @xmath13 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 by power corrections that vanish at @xmath78 .",
    "for instance , given an explicit result for the hard and soft functions , one can always rewrite it using @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "although the difference is suppressed by positive powers of @xmath32 , the two choices give different numerical results upon integration . in section",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , we will explain in detail our method for dealing with this ambiguity .",
    "the use of boldface in ( [ eq : fac ] ) indicates that the hard and soft functions are matrices in color space .",
    "the hard function originates from virtual corrections and is the same as that in the pim case @xcite , once the variables @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 are expressed in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath81 .",
    "the soft function captures contributions arising from the emission of soft real radiation .",
    "it depends on the details of the phase - space integrals and is different in 1pi and pim kinematics .",

    "more generally , they give rise to the dominant higher - order corrections to the hadronic cross section if the product of pdfs in ( [ eq : pt , y ] ) falls off very quickly away from values of @xmath85 where @xmath86 . in either case , resumming such terms to all orders can lead to improved theoretical predictions .",
    "this is the topic of the next section .",
    "in @xcite , factorization and resummation for the case of pim kinematics was studied in detail .",
    "most of that discussion can be carried over directly to the case of 1pi kinematics .",
    "in fact , the differences between 1pi and pim kinematics arise solely from the structure of real emission in the two cases and therefore affect only the soft function , which must be modified in two essential ways .",
    "first , the phase - space integrals for real emission in the soft limit change , so the fixed - order expansion of the soft function is different from its pim counterpart and must be calculated from scratch .",
    "second , the rg equation for the soft function , derived using the rg invariance of the cross section along with the evolution equations of the hard function and pdfs , also differs slightly from its expression in pim kinematics . in what follows we",
    "focus on how to deal with these two differences with respect to pim kinematics and otherwise just quote results from @xcite for the pieces which remain unchanged . in particular , we derive the explicit one - loop soft function and the rg equation needed for nnll resummation in 1pi kinematics , and present results for approximate nnlo formulas in fixed - order perturbation theory .",
    "we also discuss the structure of power corrections to the leading - order term in the threshold expansion and explain how a certain set of subleading corrections in @xmath32 appears naturally within the scet formalism .      in general ,",
    "the soft function is related to the vacuum expectation value of a soft wilson - loop operator . to calculate it explicitly ,",
    "we first generalize the derivation of the differential cross section at partonic threshold given for pim kinematics in @xcite to the 1pi case .    in the limit where extra gluon radiation is soft",
    ", the differential cross section can be factorized as and @xmath87 are summed over the channel indices @xmath88 . in order to keep the notation as simple as possible , in the remainder of this section we suppress the sum and indices . ]",
    "@xmath89 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the expectation value of the wilson - loop operator in position space .",
    "since the integrand depends on @xmath90 only through @xmath91 and in the exponent , its calculation is simplified by going to the rest frame of the inclusive final state @xmath92 in ( [ eq : partprocess ] ) , which consists of the anti - top - quark plus additional soft radiation . in this frame",
    "@xmath93 , and we can drop the dependence on it in @xmath94 . the integral over @xmath90 then produces a factor of @xmath95 , and the exponent depends only on @xmath96 , which is the energy of the soft radiation in this particular frame . using the @xmath97-function to perform the integral over @xmath98 , and converting the result to a differential cross section in @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we obtain @xmath99 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now introduce the momentum - space soft function according to @xmath100 the soft function entering the factorization formula is then given by @xmath101 using the results above , one recovers the factorization formula ( [ eq : fac ] ) for the hard - scattering kernels by noting that @xmath102    it is instructive to compare this derivation with that given in @xcite for pim kinematics . in both cases , the calculations are simplified by working in a frame where the soft function depends only on the time component @xmath103 , or in momentum space , on the energy of the extra soft radiation ( although of course the final results are lorentz invariant and do not depend on the frame ) . in pim kinematics",
    "this is the partonic center - of - mass frame , while in 1pi kinematics it is the center - of - mass frame of the unobserved partonic final state , consisting of the anti - top - quark plus additional soft radiation .",
    "the difference between these two cases comes from which combinations of the momenta are counted as `` small '' : in pim kinematics it is @xmath104 against @xmath105 , while in 1pi kinematics it is @xmath106 against @xmath107 .",
    "this difference has important implications for the structure of power corrections in the two types of kinematics .",
    "such power corrections come both from time - ordered products involving the subleading scet lagrangian and operators , which before phase - space integrations are the same in both cases , and from the approximations in the phase - space integrals , e.g. @xmath108 in 1pi and @xmath109 in pim kinematics .",
    "the corrections from the latter source can be quite different : for 1pi kinematics they involve the expansion parameter @xmath110 , while for pim kinematics they involve the expansion parameter @xmath111 .",
    "a complete analysis of power corrections is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , in the case of drell - yan @xcite and higgs production @xcite near threshold it was found that by keeping the exact dependence @xmath112 in the scet soft functions analogous to ( [ eq : sdef ] ) one can reproduce a set of logarithmic power corrections involving @xmath26 , which are indeed present in the analytic results for the fixed - order expansions of the hard - scattering kernels .",
    "keeping such terms improved agreement of the threshold - expanded hard - scattering kernels with the exact results in qcd . in @xcite , we followed this procedure in pim kinematics , using the exact form @xmath113 instead of @xmath114 in the first argument of the soft function .",
    "results in this `` @xmath115 '' scheme include the same type of logarithmic corrections found in drell - yan and higgs production , and the numerical results for the threshold expansion at nlo in this scheme are indeed improved significantly compared to the traditional pim scheme @xcite , which does not include such corrections . in 1pi kinematics ,",
    "the equivalent procedure is to use @xmath116 , as we have already indicated explicitly in ( [ eq : sdef ] ) .",
    "we will refer to numerical results obtained with this choice as being calculated in the `` @xmath117 '' scheme .",
    "since the factorization formula ( [ eq : fac2 ] ) is derived in the limit @xmath118 , it would be equally valid to use @xmath119 in the first argument of the soft function ( [ eq : sdef ] ) .",
    "this is in fact the choice that has been made in previous calculations in 1pi kinematics @xcite , and later on we will refer to this as the `` 1pi '' scheme .",
    "when expanded in fixed - order perturbation theory , the two schemes differ through terms involving @xmath31 , which are power suppressed in the limit @xmath86 .",
    "however , in our analysis in sections  [ sec : threshold ] and [ sec : pheno ] we will see that these power - suppressed effects can be numerically important , and that the agreement with the exact numerical results at nlo is improved in the @xmath117 scheme . furthermore , although in this case we do not have explicit analytic results to compare with , we note that the logarithms of @xmath120 appear naturally in the fixed - order nlo calculations of hard gluon corrections through terms of the form @xmath121 , see for instance eqs .",

    "this would obviously be the case if we chose @xmath196 , since then the logarithmic corrections would vanish , but in that case the running coupling in the soft corrections would , for some value of @xmath32 , be evaluated at the landau pole , which would spoil the clear separation between perturbative and non - perturbative physics accomplished by using the effective field - theory formalism .",
    "therefore , as usually done in momentum - space resummation @xcite , we will view the soft scale as a function of the observables @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and choose it based on the convergence of the physical cross section .",

    ". the formulas then sum logarithms of the numerical ratio @xmath197 , where @xmath168 is the dynamically generated soft scale .",
    "the same reasoning applies to the choice of the hard and factorization scales , and an advantage of the resummation formalism is that the three scales can be varied independently as a way of estimating perturbative uncertainties .",
    "this approach should be contrasted with that based on approximate nnlo formulas . in using such an approximation , one assumes that the logarithmic corrections from the @xmath198 distributions account for the bulk of the nnlo corrections in fixed order at an arbitrary factorization scale @xmath199 , and at the same time that the corrections at nnnlo and beyond , evaluated at that scale , are small enough that the perturbative series is well behaved . from this point of view , the resummation formalism is just a useful tool for constructing the approximate fixed - order expansion , and no physical significance is given to the soft scale @xmath168 , on which the final answer does not depend .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the fixed - order expansion of the nlo+nnll formulas to nnlo in @xmath33 is not exactly equivalent to the approximate nnlo formulas from the previous section .",
    "the direct expansion of the nlo+nnll formulas to nnlo contains explicit dependence on the scale @xmath168 and also a different pattern of plus - distributions compared to the approximate nnlo formulas .",
    "for instance , the approximate nnlo formula contains @xmath200 distributions , but the expansion of the nlo+nnll formula to nnlo in fixed order contains at most @xmath201 distributions , as required by the altarelli - parisi equations .",
    "this aspect of the calculation is discussed in greater detail in the appendix .    the optimal method for including the higher - order perturbative effects",
    "is not entirely clear without further information .",
    "the reason is that it is not possible to tell whether the logarithmic corrections from the partonic threshold region can be considered large , or how to minimize them with a proper choice of @xmath168 , until _",
    "after _ the integration over @xmath32 .",
    "after that integration , they give large perturbative corrections to the differential cross section if the pdfs fall off very quickly away from the region where @xmath86 , an effect referred to as `` dynamical threshold enhancement '' @xcite .",
    "since the pdfs are not known analytically , it is only possible to assess the extent to which the corrections in the partonic threshold region are dynamically enhanced through a numerical study .",
    "we thus return to a discussion of the relative merits of resummation vs. approximate nnlo expansions after our numerical studies in sections  [ sec : threshold ] and  [ sec : pheno ] .",
    "we now describe the numerical implementation of our results .",
    "a central issue is that there are power - suppressed ambiguities in the evaluation of ( [ eq : pt , y ] ) and ( [ eq : fac ] ) away from the exact threshold limit , and we describe in detail how we deal with these ambiguities in the following .",
    "we also use this section to summarize some of the inputs used throughout the rest of the paper , in particular the pdf sets , the strong coupling constant , and the top - quark mass .    as pointed out in section  [ sec : kin ] , there are power - suppressed ambiguities in the choice of the variables @xmath73 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 of the hard and soft functions . apart from when it appears in the @xmath97-function or plus - distributions , in the perturbative calculation of the hard and soft functions one can set @xmath78 everywhere and use @xmath202 to rewrite the hard - scattering kernels in many different forms . while these are all formally equivalent in the threshold limit @xmath203 , they change the functional dependence of the hard - scattering kernels on @xmath62 and @xmath63 , so the integration in ( [ eq : pt , y ] ) gives different results for the pieces multiplying plus - distributions in @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , since one typically trades either @xmath62 or @xmath63 in favor of @xmath32 as an integration variable , another obvious choice is to use @xmath204 before integration , again leading to numerically different answers which are nonetheless equivalent in the threshold limit @xmath86 .",
    "our method of fixing this ambiguity is as follows .",
    "first , we enforce @xmath202 in the hard - scattering kernels , and use this to eliminate either @xmath74 or @xmath75 as an independent variable .",
    "we then define the two cross sections @xmath205 we have changed variables from @xmath63 or @xmath62 to @xmath32 in the two equations , respectively , so that @xmath206 finally , we drop all dependence on @xmath32 in the hard - scattering kernels by using @xmath207 in ( [ eq : sigmat ] ) , and @xmath208 in ( [ eq : sigmau ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that with this choice @xmath209 and @xmath210 are not necessarily the same , although the difference is power suppressed .",
    "we shall take the average of the two as the final result for the differential cross section : @xmath211 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this way , the rapidity distribution in the gluon channel is invariant under @xmath212 , as it should be , and the relation ( [ eq : cpi ] ) is preserved .",
    "the scheme above specifies our procedure for the numerical evaluation of the threshold formulas for the differential distribution in @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in the next section we will also study the differential distribution in @xmath14 . rather than",
    "define yet another scheme , we will calculate this through an exact change of variables and integration orders in ( [ eq : tot ] ) .",

    "we have also defined the parton luminosity function @xmath217 since the change of variables is carried out exactly , ( [ eq : tot ] ) and ( [ eq : tot2 ] ) give the same result for the total cross section when integrated over .",
    "we should emphasize again that the procedure above is by no means unique . in @xcite , for instance , the scheme was instead specified at the level of the @xmath14 distribution . in particular , the hard - scattering kernels as a function of @xmath218 were written in a form specified in the appendix of that paper , @xmath219 was eliminated as an integration variable using @xmath204 , and then the integration over @xmath32 was carried out followed by that over @xmath74 .. ] we will discuss the numerical differences which result from using such an equivalent procedure when we compare with previous literature in section  [ subsec:1picompare ] .    having specified our procedure for evaluating the formulas in the threshold region ,",
    "we next clarify how to match the results with fixed - order perturbation theory at nlo .",
    "the exact results contain the perturbative corrections to our formula which vanish in the limit @xmath69 , and to obtain solid phenomenological results it is important to include them . in resummed perturbation theory , we achieve nlo+nnll accuracy by evaluating differential cross sections according to @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the exact result in fixed order , and @xmath222 captures the leading singular terms in the threshold limit @xmath69 at nlo . to obtain approximate nnlo results in fixed order , we simply compute @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the approximate nnlo correction to the differential cross section obtained using the coefficient function ( [ eq : c2 ] ) .",
    "the size of the power corrections contained in parentheses in the second term of ( [ eq : fixedmatching ] ) depends on the region of phase space in which the differential cross sections are evaluated , and also on the interplay of the hard - scattering kernels with the pdfs .",
    "the power corrections are expected to be small when @xmath225 , since in that case @xmath86 .",
    "however , experiments do not typically reconstruct @xmath13 as an observable . for more interesting differential distributions",
    "the limit @xmath86 can be enforced via a restriction to the machine threshold , for instance by requiring that @xmath226 for the @xmath52 spectrum , but in this case the differential cross section would be extremely small . away from such special kinematic regions",
    "the leading terms in the partonic threshold limit are dominant only if a dynamical enhancement occurs , because the product of pdfs appearing in the cross section falls off sharply away from the region where @xmath69 .",
    "some systematic studies of the conditions under which threshold enhancement is effective have been made in @xcite , but in the end this is largely a numerical question , which must be examined on a case - by - case basis .",
    "given its importance , we address the issue of threshold enhancement and power corrections to the threshold expansion in some detail in the next section .",
    "we end this section by summarizing some of the inputs needed for numerical predictions , which we shall use in the rest of the paper unless otherwise indicated .",
    "the results depend on the input parameters @xmath182 , @xmath33 , and the pdfs .",
    "we shall use the mstw2008 pdf sets @xcite , and change the pdf set according to the order at which the perturbative hard - scattering kernel is evaluated , as indicated in table  [ tab : pdforder ] .",

    "we take @xmath229  gev in the pole scheme .",
    "using a more physical quark mass such as that in the @xmath230 scheme can lead to a better convergence of the perturbative series @xcite , but for the purposes of this work we shall leave that issue aside .    finally , in the following we do not consider the theoretical uncertainty on the top - pair cross section induced by the error on @xmath231 , which is an input parameter .",
    "however , a recent study employing cteq pdfs shows that this additional theoretical uncertainty can be as big as @xmath232 for the total top - quark pair production cross section at the lhc @xcite .",

    "an analysis of the effects of the @xmath33 uncertainty on several cross sections of interest at the tevatron and at the lhc was also carried out by the mstw collaboration @xcite . however , the top - quark pair production is not among the processes considered in that work .",

    "the subleading terms generated in this way are of the form @xmath31 in 1pi kinematics , and @xmath26 in pim kinematics ( with @xmath246 ) .",
    "we have implemented these new terms in our numerical analysis summarized below , where results including them are referred to as the @xmath117 and @xmath115 schemes .",
    "results neglecting them are referred to as the 1pi and pim schemes and should correspond with previous results at a given order in perturbation theory .",
    "our improved calculations of the hard - scattering kernels near threshold are _ a priori _ only important in regions of phase space where kinematic restrictions imply the partonic threshold limit @xmath86 .",
    "however , the differential cross section in such regions is very small . beyond that",
    ", the improved predictions are important if a dynamical threshold enhancement occurs , due to a sharp fall - off of the pdfs away from integration regions where @xmath86 . in section  [ sec : threshold ]",
    "we performed a very detailed discussion of the mechanism of threshold enhancement , and compared its effectiveness in 1pi and pim kinematics at the level of differential distributions and the total cross section .",
    "the main finding was that the leading power corrections to the threshold limit in 1pi kinematics , which scale as @xmath247 , are in general larger than the leading corrections in pim kinematics , which scale as @xmath248 . at the lhc with @xmath239  tev",
    "these corrections can become quite large .",
    "this makes us somewhat reserved about the utility of the threshold expansion in 1pi kinematics , especially at larger values of @xmath52 . including the extra subleading terms unique to the @xmath117 approximation seemed to account for the power corrections to a good degree of accuracy in the @xmath135 channel and also to some level in the @xmath134 channel , at least in regions of phase space where the differential cross section is large .",
    "since the top - quark pair production cross section at the tevatron is dominated by the quark - antiquark channel , the predictions obtained in the @xmath117 scheme at the tevatron center - of - mass energy are expected to provide a reliable approximation to the exact results . in all cases , but especially at the lhc with @xmath239  tev ,",
    "the pure 1pi expansion gave larger corrections compared to any other approximation , and we are rather skeptical of any results obtained in that scheme . for the reasons mentioned above , we limited the phenomenological analysis to areas where the differential distributions are fairly large , or else to integrated quantities such as the forward - backward asymmetry and the total cross section .",
    "our results for the rapidity and transverse - momentum distributions can be found in figures  [ fig : ydistributions ] and  [ fig : ptdistributions ] . as expected , including the higher - order perturbative corrections in the form of nlo+nnll or approximate nnlo predictions leads to a stabilization of the results under variations of the different perturbative scales .",
    "our main results for the total cross section can be found in tables  [ tab : crosssections400 ] and  [ tab : crosssections ] .",
    "although we consider the @xmath115 numbers more trustworthy , it is reassuring that the @xmath117 numbers are actually in very good agreement with them .",
    "this is not the case for the pure 1pi numbers , which come out significantly larger in all cases .",
    "if different types of kinematics is to be used as a source of uncertainty in predictions based on soft - gluon resummation , we believe the true results are more accurately reflected in tables  [ tab : crosssections400 ] and  [ tab : crosssections ] .    in section  [ sec : totalcs ] and the appendix we analyzed in detail the origin of the numerical differences between nlo+nnll and approximate nnlo calculations .",
    "the structure of the plus - distributions considered in the two approaches is different , since in the resummation approach plus - distributions and logarithms of scale ratios are formally of the same order .",
    "we showed why our choice of the soft and hard scales for the nlo+nnll calculations is sound and how the resummed results are stable with respect to reasonable variations of these scales .    in conclusion",
    ", we obtained nlo+nnll predictions for the top - pair transverse - momentum and rapidity distributions at hadron colliders . in the case of the transverse - momentum distribution at the tevatron ,",
    "the predictions presented here can be already compared with experimental measurements . by integrating the results for the differential distributions we obtained predictions for fully inclusive observables such as the forward - backward asymmetry and the total cross section . for the total cross section in particular",

    "in our numerical analysis we considered two different ways of including higher - order perturbative corrections to the hard - scattering kernels : constructing approximate expansions to nnlo in fixed order , and all - orders resummmation to nnll accuracy .",

    "here we explain this statement in more detail , and show explicitly what types of higher - order corrections the master formula ( [ eq : resc ] ) resums .",
    "to do so , it is sufficient to ignore the matrix structure of the rg equations , and just consider hard and soft functions which are simple functions of their arguments . then the treatment of the hard function is straightforward , and the complication for the soft function is its non - locality .    to explain the issue , it is simplest to start with the hard function . ignoring its matrix structure and dependence on kinematic invariants , its rg equation is of the form @xmath249 where @xmath250 .",

    ", one chooses @xmath264 and runs to the scale @xmath199 using the all - orders solution",
    ". then the exponential factors resum logarithms which count as @xmath265 and are large for @xmath266 . to see this explicitly , we get rid of @xmath267 everywhere by using ( with @xmath268 ) @xmath269 and re - expand the solution in ( [ eq : resh ] ) as a series in @xmath270 . for reference ,",

    "all the dependence on @xmath263 drops out to that order , as long as we keep the one - loop matching correction .",
    "however , this is _ not _ the case if we expand our nll approximation of the resummed hard function to nlo . in that case",
    ", the nlo matching coefficient is of higher - order in the counting and not included in the formula , so after expansion to nlo dependence on the scale @xmath263 remains .",
    "the direct expansion of our nll formula at nlo in fixed order reads @xmath275\\right\\ } .\\ ] ] this is necessarily different than the `` approximate nlo '' formula one would deduce by dropping the coefficient @xmath276 from ( [ eq : nloh ] ) , because it depends on @xmath263 , but if we set @xmath277 it is the same , and it is for this reason that one can still say the nll solution `` resums logarithms of the form @xmath278 to all orders '' , although a more accurate statement would be that it `` resums logarithms of the form @xmath279 to all orders '' , which includes the possibility of other choices such as @xmath280 .",
    "given this fact , it makes little sense to construct an approximate formula for a quantity such as the hard function : if there are large logarithms , it is just as easy to sum them to all orders as it is to construct the fixed - order expansion , and if the logarithms are not large , there is no reason to include that subset of the higher - order corrections without the full answer .",
    "we can repeat the analysis above to compare the structure of approximate fixed - order expansions and resummed formulas for the soft function . in this case",

    "this is readily done using the expansion @xmath289 where the @xmath290 are defined as @xmath291_+ .\\ ] ]    as was the case with the hard function , the all - orders solution for the resummed soft function does not actually depend on the scale @xmath168 , but its truncation to a given logarithmic order ( e.g.  nnll ) introduces residual scale dependence . as explained earlier in the paper , our method is to choose @xmath168 to be close to the numerical value where the corrections from the soft function to the ( differential ) cross section are minimal .",
    "we then adopt the parametric counting @xmath292 and apply rg - improved perturbation theory with @xmath293 , and the exponential factors resum logarithms of the form @xmath294 to all orders .",
    "since the scale @xmath168 is dynamically generated through the numerical analysis , it does not appear in the fixed - order calculation , so the resummation formula deals with different types of corrections than the approximate fixed - order formulas . where @xmath295 , so the formulas effectively resum logarithms of the slopes of the pdfs . ] for this reason , the structure of @xmath290 distributions appearing at a given order is not the same in the two approaches .",
    "we now show this in more detail , working first to nlo . in this case , the `` approximate nlo '' formula derived from the solution ( [ eq : stexp ] ) reads @xmath296.\\ ] ] this should be compared with the expansion of the nll formula to nlo in fixed order , for which the nlo correction reads ( with @xmath297 ) @xmath298 + \\dots \\,.\\ ] ] the `` approximate nlo '' formula has @xmath299 distributions , while the nlo expansion of our nll formula has only @xmath185 distributions . in the counting of rg - improved perturbation theory , however , @xmath300 , so the tower of logarithms produced by the expansion of the nll formulas is of course correct .",
    "the analogous formula at nnlo is rather lengthy , but to illustrate its structure , we focus on the leading correction in the logarithmic power counting , which reads @xmath301,\\ ] ] while the leading term of the `` approximate nnlo '' formula is @xmath302 again , for @xmath303 the terms in the two equations are of the same parameteric order but contain different types of distributions : the resummed formulas generate at most @xmath304 distributions , while the approximate nnlo formulas generate @xmath305 distributions",
    ".    from the discussion above it should be obvious that our formula does not literally resum the highest tower of @xmath290 distributions to all orders , but rather terms which count that way in rg - improved perturbation theory , when the dynamically generated soft scale satisfies @xmath292 . in the case of the hard function",
    ", we noted that the fixed - order corrections produced by expanding the resummed formula were equal to those in the approximate formula for the special choice @xmath277 .",
    "for the soft function , there is no numerical value of @xmath168 for which this would be true , but the two are equal if we replace @xmath306 and take the derivatives before re - expanding @xmath164 in @xmath307 .",
    "this procedure can be generalized to all orders by evaluating the formula @xmath308\\bigg|_{\\ln(\\mu_s^2/\\mu_f^2 ) \\to \\partial    \\eta } \\right\\}\\frac{1}{\\omega}\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\mu_f}\\right)^{2\\eta}\\frac{e^{-2      \\gamma_e \\eta}}{\\gamma(2\\eta)}\\bigg|_{\\eta\\to 0 } \\,,\\ ] ] where the factor in the curly brackets is understood to be expanded to all orders as a series in @xmath307 and so is a function only of @xmath309 . in this way",
    ", we exponentiate the derivatives with respect to @xmath164 , which are what generate the highest - order distributions , and the expansion of the above formula to any given accuracy in fixed - order reproduces the approximate formulas . for instance , if we include the exact one - loop matching ( which is just @xmath310 ) and the two - loop anomalous dimensions , the expansion of the above object gives back our approximate nnlo formula for the soft function , plus higher - order terms that resum all the higher - order @xmath290 distributions at nnll order , after converting the derivatives with respect to @xmath164 with replacement rules . while this procedure generalizes choosing @xmath311 in the hard function , it is by no means the same conceptually .",
    "the exact hard function is independent of @xmath263 , so varying it around values @xmath312 gives a way of estimating the higher - order terms .",
    "however , it would make no sense to replace , for instance , @xmath313 in ( [ eq : allorders ] ) , with @xmath314 , since the derivatives generate both @xmath173-independent and @xmath173-dependent terms .",
    "the conclusion of this discussion is that results based on approximate nnlo formulas contain different information than those based on nlo+nnll resummation .",
    "this is not just due to a truncation of the nnll series to nnlo , but also to the fact that the resummation formula exponentiates logarithms depending on the ratio @xmath315 in combination with higher - order logarithmic plus - distributions , with @xmath168 a dynamically generated numerical soft scale .",
    "such logarithms do not appear in the fixed - order calculation , which is independent of @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , the choice between using approximate nnlo and nlo+nnll amounts to whether one takes seriously the improved convergence of the soft function at a numerically small soft scale .",
    "if so , one should use the resummed formulas , if not , one should use the approximate fixed - order calculations . in practice",

    "<S> we use techniques from soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) to derive renormalization - group improved predictions for single - particle inclusive ( 1pi ) observables in top - quark pair production at hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study the top - quark transverse - momentum and rapidity distributions , the forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron , and the total cross section at nlo+nnll order in resummed perturbation theory and at approximate nnlo in fixed order . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform a detailed analysis of power corrections to the leading terms in the threshold expansion of the partonic hard - scattering kernels . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , although the threshold expansion in 1pi kinematics is susceptible to numerically significant power corrections , its predictions for the total cross section are in good agreement with those obtained by integrating the top - pair invariant - mass distribution in pair invariant - mass kinematics , as long as a certain set of subleading terms appearing naturally within the scet formalism is included .    </S>",
