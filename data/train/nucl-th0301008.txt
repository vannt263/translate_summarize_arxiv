    "the possible existence of shell - stabilized superheavy nuclei , predicted with realistic nuclear potentials @xcite and the macroscopic - microscopic ( mm ) method @xcite , has been a driving force behind experimental and theoretical efforts to investigate the superheavy nuclei .",
    "these investigations pose a number of experimental and theoretical challenges . the recent discovery of elements with z=112 @xcite , z=114 @xcite and z=116 @xcite ( for review of the present experimental situation see refs .",
    "@xcite ) clearly shows great progress on the experimental side , but also indicates difficulties in the investigation of nuclei with low production cross - sections and analyses based only on 1 or 2 events .",
    "the theoretical challenges are also considerable since different theoretical methods predict different spherical shell closures .",
    "modern calculations based on the mm method with the woods - saxon @xcite , nilsson @xcite , and folded yukawa @xcite potentials indicate @xmath1 and @xmath2 as the spherical shell closures .",
    "it is necessary to say , however , that some earlier calculations indicated @xmath3 as a possible magic number ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "there are differences in the predictions of self - consistent calculations , which depend both on the approach and on the effective force .",
    "self - consistent calculations based on the hartree - fock method with skyrme forces ( shf ) predict spherical shell closures at @xmath3 and @xmath2 for most of the forces @xcite",
    ". however , some forces indicate @xmath1 ( ski4 ) and @xmath4 ( ski3 ) as proton shell closures , while some predict no doubly magic superheavy nuclei at all .",
    "on the other hand , the relativistic mean field theory ( rmf ) prefers @xmath4 and @xmath5 as spherical shell closures @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath1 and @xmath2 also appear as the shell closures in some rmf calculations @xcite . for a detailed comparison of the predictions of the different skyrme and rmf calculations ,",
    "see refs .",
    "hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations with the gogny force give @xmath6 and @xmath7 as spherical shell closures @xcite .",
    "clearly , the accuracy of predictions of spherical shell closures depends sensitively on the accuracy of describing the single - particle energies , which becomes especially important for superheavy nuclei , where the level density is very high .",
    "variations in single - particle energy of @xmath8 mev yield spherical shell gaps at different particle numbers , which restricts the reliability in extrapolating to the unknown region .",
    "usually , the mm method describes the single - particle energies rather well .",
    "this is due to the fact that the experimental data on single - particle states are used directly in the parametrization of the single - particle potential .",
    "moreover , different parametrizations of the single - particle potential are used in different mass regions . however",
    ", the extrapolation of the single - particle potential may be much less reliable since it is not determined self - consistently .",
    "for example , microscopic models predict that the appearance of the shell closures in superheavy nuclei is influenced by a central depression of the nuclear density distribution @xcite .",
    "this effect can not be treated in self - consistent way in current mm models .",
    "although the nucleonic potential is defined in shf and rmf approaches in a fully self - consistent way , this does not guarantee that single - particle degrees of freedom are accurately described , as indicated by the large variety of the parametrizations ( more than 60 for shf and about 20 for rmf @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the parameters have been fitted in almost all cases to the bulk properties of spherical nuclei .",
    "single - particle information on spin - orbit splittings is used only in the fits of the parameters of the skyrme and gogny forces .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is a relativistic effect , which arises naturally in the rmf theory .",
    "thus , available rmf fits were obtained without the use of any single - particle information . for heavy nuclei ,",
    "the calculated rmf single - particle states were directly compared with experimental data only in spherical nuclei ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "these comparisons , however , do not reveal the accuracy of the description of the single - particle states because the particle - vibration coupling , which can affect considerably the energies of single - particle states in spherical nuclei @xcite , has been neglected .",
    "compared with the mm method , self - consistent calculations have been confronted with experiment to a lesser degree and for a smaller number of physical observables ( mainly binding energies and quantities related to their derivatives ) . for many parametrizations , even the reliability of describing conventional nuclei is poorly known .",
    "in such a situation , it is important to perform a comprehensive study of the heaviest nuclei for which detailed spectroscopic information is available . _ the results of such a study will allow us to better judge the reliability of predictions for superheavy nuclei . _",
    "the experimental data on deformed nuclei around @xmath0no provides sufficient information for such a test .",
    "the purpose of this work is to compare the predictions of rmf theory with these data .",
    "rmf calculations have been compared with experiment in this mass region in only ref .",
    "however , the comparison was restricted to binding energies and quantities related to their derivatives . in addition , the pair correlations were treated in the bcs approximation , with no particle number projection .    in the present manuscript ,",
    "the cranked relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( crhb ) theory @xcite , with approximate particle number projection by means of the lipkin - nogami method ( crhb+ln theory ) , is employed for a detailed investigation of a wide set of experimental observables .",
    "the use of the lipkin - nogami method has the clear advantage of avoiding the collapse of pairing correlations at large shell gaps .",
    "we address for the first time the question of the blocking procedure in odd mass nuclei in the framework of the rmf theory , with effects of time - reversal symmetry breaking taken into account in a fully self - consistent way .",

    "in relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory @xcite the nucleus is described as a system of point - like nucleons ( dirac spinors ) coupled to mesons and photons .",
    "the nucleons interact by exchanging scalar @xmath11-mesons , vector @xmath12- , @xmath13- mesons and photons .",
    "the isoscalar - scalar @xmath14-mesons generate strong intermediate range attraction between the nucleons . for the vector particles we have to distinguish the time - like and the space - like components . in the case of photons , they correspond to the coulomb field and the magnetic field when currents are present . for the isoscalar - vector @xmath12-meson , the time - like component provides a very strong repulsion at short distances for all combinations of nucleons , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . for the isovector - vector @xmath13-meson ,",
    "the time - like components give rise to a short range repulsion for like nucleons ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) and a short range attraction for unlike nucleons ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "they also have a strong influence on the symmetry energy .",
    "the space - like components of the @xmath12- and @xmath13-mesons lead to an interaction between currents , which is attractive in the case of the @xmath12-meson for all combinations ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and in the case of the @xmath13-meson attractive for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but repulsive for @xmath17 . within the mean field theory",
    ", these currents only occur in cases of time - reversal breaking mean fields , which applies to rotating or odd - mass nuclei .",
    "the cranked relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( crhb ) theory @xcite extends the rmf theory to rotating nuclei and includes pairing correlations .",
    "if an approximate particle number projection is performed by means of the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method @xcite , the abbreviation crhb+ln will be used . since the theory is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the features important for the present discussion will be outlined below .",
    "the crhb+ln equations for the fermions in the rotating frame are given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the dirac hamiltonian for the nucleon with mass @xmath22 ; @xmath23 is defined from the average particle number constraints for protons and neutrons ; @xmath24 is the density matrix ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 are quasiparticle dirac spinors ; @xmath27 denotes the quasiparticle energies ; and @xmath28 is the angular momentum component .",

    "the form of the crhb+ln equations given above corresponds to the shift of the ln modification into the particle - hole channel .",

    "the time - reversal symmetry is broken by the coriolis field . without rotation",
    ", it is broken when the time - reversal orbitals are not occupied pairwise . in the dirac equation ,",
    "the space - like components of the vector mesons @xmath37 and @xmath38 have the same structure as the space - like component @xmath39 generated by the photons . since @xmath39 is the vector potential of the magnetic field , by analogy the effect due to presence of the vector field @xmath35",
    "is called _ nuclear magnetism _ @xcite .",
    "it has considerable influence on the magnetic moments @xcite and the moments of inertia @xcite . in the present calculations",
    "the spatial components of the vector mesons are properly taken into account in a fully self - consistent way .",
    "the detailed description of the mesonic degrees of freedom in the crhb+ln theory is presented in ref .",

    "these sets differ in the experimental input used in the fitting procedure .",
    "the binding energies of a number of spherical nuclei were included in the fit of all those sets , but the selection of nuclei was different . nl1 and nl - z employ the data mainly from the valley of beta - stability , while additional information on neutron - rich nuclei has been used in the fit of the nl3 set . moreover , there is a difference in the selection of additional observables used in the fit .",

    "this result is in contrast with the good agreement obtained by the same method for superdeformed bands with @xmath62 @xcite and for nuclei in the rare - earth @xcite and @xmath60 @xcite regions .",
    "different parametrizations of the rmf lagrangian give quite similar results for the moments of inertia if @xmath89 .",
    "for example , the results of the crhb+ln calculations based on the nl3 parametrization @xcite ( marked as nl3+d1s+ln in fig .",
    "[ no254-j2j1-comp]c ) provide moments of inertia which are only slightly lower ( by @xmath92 mev@xmath86 ) than the ones obtained with the nl1 parametrization .",
    "the crhb+ln calculations with the nl - z @xcite , nlsh @xcite and nl - ra1 @xcite parametrizations of the rmf lagrangian give results which are quite similar to those obtained with nl3no also show a weak dependence of the moments of inertia on the rmf parametrization , and , thus on details of the single - particle structure .",

    "the moments of inertia are very similar despite the differences in the single - particle spectra near the fermi level ( see figs .",
    "[ proton - no254-sp ] and [ neutron - no254-sp ] ) .",
    "hence , the most likely reason for discrepancies between experiment and the crhb+ln calculations lies in an inadequate parametrization of the gogny force ( d1s ) in the particle - particle channel for this mass region , which gives too strong pair correlations .",
    "this is not quite unexpected since no experimental data above @xmath95pb have been used when the d1s set was fitted .",
    "the study of other heavy nuclei around @xmath0no also shows that the kinematic moments of inertia obtained in the crhb+ln calculations with the original d1s force ( scaling factor @xmath59 ) are systematically lower than experimental ones ( by @xmath96 in even - even @xmath97pu nuclei ) .",
    "different parametrizations of the rmf lagrangian give similar results and the deformations of these nuclei are well described in the calculations ( see sect .",
    "[ deformation ] ) .",
    "it is unlikely that other available parametrizations for the gogny force such as d1 @xcite and d1p @xcite will improve the situation , since they produce even stronger pairing than the d1s set in superdeformed bands of the @xmath62 mass region @xcite .",
    "the results of the calculations for the @xmath0no rotational band obtained in the non - relativistic cranked hfb approach based on the gogny force with d1s set of parameters @xcite seem to support this interpretation .",
    "these calculations , which are performed without particle number projection , also come very close to the data .",
    "one presumes that the inclusion of particle number projection by means of the ln method will lower the calculated kinematic moment of inertia , as has been seen in the rare - earth region @xcite , leading to a similar situation as described above .",
    "quantitative information on the strength of the pair correlations can be extracted from the odd - even mass differences , excitation energies of high - k isomers or the moments of inertia .",
    "we use the moments of inertia for an adjustment of the strength of the gogny force because they are not too sensitive to the details of the single - particle spectrum ( see above ) .",
    "our crhb+ln calculations indicate that in the @xmath63 mass region the strength of pairing correlations should be reduced in order to reproduce the observed moments of inertia .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath58 of the gogny d1s force ( see eq .",

    "the values found for the various parametrizations of the rmf lagrangian are given in table [ table - scaling ] .",
    "these scaling factors , which are nearly the same , are used in all subsequent calculations , unless otherwise specified .",

    "our choice of the scaling factor @xmath58 leads also to a reasonable description of the odd - even mass differences in the crhb+ln calculations ( see columns 5 and 6 in table [ table - odd - even ] ) .",
    "the need for attenuation of the d1s force within the framework of the crhb+ln theory is not surprising since its pairing properties were adjusted by fitting only the odd - even mass differences of the sn isotopes .",
    "thus the quality of the description of pairing may deteriorate far from this mass region .",
    "indeed , the moments of inertia of nuclei in mass regions closer to the sn region , such as the rare - earth region @xcite , the superdeformed @xmath62 mass region @xcite and neutron - deficient @xmath60 region @xcite , are described well by means of crhb+ln calculations using the original d1s force .",
    "crhb calculations ( without ln ) with original scaling factor @xmath59 provide a reasonable description of both moments of inertia before band crossing ( see fig .",
    "[ no254-j2j1-comp]b ) and odd - even mass differences ( see table [ table - odd - even ] ) . this approach will be applied to the calculations of the quasiparticle spectra in odd nuclei ( see sects .

    "indeed , in the calculations with the nl3 set the neutron contribution to the total moment of inertia ( see fig .",

    "in order to understand the quantity @xmath66 related to the second derivative of the binding energy as a function of nucleon number better , we first discuss the case when pairing is neglected .",
    "then we perform a detailed analysis with pairing included in the crhb+ln framework .",
    "figure [ delta - no - pairing ] compares @xmath66 obtained in the rmf calculations without pairing with @xmath281 , where @xmath156 is the energy gap between the last occupied and the first unoccupied single - particle level in the @xmath282 system .",
    "one can see that @xmath66 is shifted down by @xmath283 mev with respect to @xmath281 .",
    "this shift can be understood within the shell - correction method @xcite , in which the total energy of the system @xmath284 in the absence of pairing is given by @xmath285 where @xmath286 is a liquid drop energy and @xmath287 is a shell energy ( superscript @xmath288 stands for neutrons , @xmath289 for protons ) .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath290 where @xmath291 is a single - particle energy , @xmath292 the smeared level density and @xmath293 the strutinsky smoothed sum . in this equation @xmath294",
    "is the fermi energy corresponding to @xmath292 and is determined from the condition of number conservation @xmath295 neglecting the variations in @xmath296 when the neutron number changes , one can write @xmath297 @xmath298 and @xmath299 are smooth functions , which weakly depend on the particle number @xcite , and the @xmath300 and @xmath301 quantities related to their second derivatives as a function of nucleon number are nearly constant within the considered interval . hence , @xmath66 differs from @xmath281 by nearly constant .",
    "although the shell - correction method is an approximation to the fully variational many - body approach such as the rmf theory , it elucidates the main physics in a simple way .",
    "this example clearly shows that @xmath66 is not a direct measure of @xmath281 .",
    "the pairing smoothes the variations of @xmath66 because there is gradual change of occupation numbers from 1 to 0 . comparing figs .",
    "[ delta - no - pairing ] and [ delta - contr - fm ] one sees that the pairing reduces the height of the maximum of @xmath66 at the @xmath119 shell gap by approximately a factor of two and increases @xmath66 at the neutron numbers away from it .",
    "this illustrates that the values of @xmath66 can not be taken as direct measure of @xmath302 since they are strongly dependent on pairing ; see also ref .",

    "the largest contributions to @xmath66 come from the particle energies ( @xmath311 ) and from the main part of the nucleonic potential @xmath312 .",
    "they are generally in opposite phase as a function of neutron number and thus they cancel each other to a large extent .",
    "it is interesting to see that the maximum ( in absolute value ) of these contributions is located at neutron number @xmath10 , while the large shell gap is seen in the single - neutron spectra at @xmath119 ( see fig .",
    "[ fm - sp - ener - neu ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to understand why the maximum of @xmath311 and @xmath313 does not correlate with the @xmath119 shell gap , but a plausible reason is related to the trend of deformation changes .",

    "[ delta - contr - fm]b and f. this is a region of neutron numbers where the deformation changes are considerable ; see fig .",
    "[ def - fm ] .",
    "this result reflects their importance in the definition of @xmath66 and again underlines the fact that many factors beyond the size of the shell gap contribute to @xmath66 .",
    "since by definition the shell gap has to have positive value and because of the reasons mentioned above , it is clear that @xmath66 can not be a direct measure of the shell gap .    however , this quantity , being related to the second derivative of the binding energy as a function of nucleon number , is more sensitive to the local decrease in the single - particle density associated with a shell gap than the two - nucleon separation energy @xmath72 .",
