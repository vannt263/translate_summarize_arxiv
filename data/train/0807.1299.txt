    "the detailed investigation of the higgs sector is anticipated as one of the central themes of the accelerator particle physics program after the higgs boson will have been observed , most likely at the lhc .",
    "the study of the higgs profile will have to determine whether the observed particle is indeed responsible for generating the mass of gauge bosons , quarks and charged leptons . a significant _ corpus _ of studies ,",
    "outlining strategies to test the higgs mechanism for gauge bosons and quarks with accuracies down to a few percent , has already been assembled  @xcite these rely on the combination of data from the lhc and an @xmath0 linear collider operating at centre - of - mass energies @xmath2 = 0.25  tev - 1.0  tev . in this paper",
    "we discuss the feasibility of a test of the higgs mechanism in the lepton sector , by verifying the scaling @xmath5 , through a precise determination of the @xmath6 coupling in the @xmath7decay , in 3  tev @xmath0 collisions . at the lhc",
    ", the significance of an observation of the @xmath7 decay is estimated to be only @xmath8  3  @xmath9 for 115  gev @xmath10 130  gev , even when combining the cms and atlas data on both the gluon and weak boson fusion production channels for 300  fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity  @xcite .",
    "it further decreases for larger values of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath0 collisions below 1.0  tev should provide with determination of @xmath12 to a relative statistical accuracy of @xmath8  0.035 for a 120  gev higgs boson but , at best , with only a signal and not with a precision measurement in the @xmath13 yukawa coupling  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 fusion process , @xmath15 , offers a large higgs cross section , provided high enough @xmath2 energies can be attained , to make this measurement possible . in this paper the detection of the @xmath16 decay in high energy @xmath0 collisions",
    "is studied using full geant-4-based simulation and reconstruction .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    "we discuss the simulation of the @xmath15 , @xmath16 process and of the relevant physics and machine - induced background .",
    "section  3 describes the detector simulation and section  4 has the results .",
    "higgs boson production in @xmath0 collisions proceeds through two main processes : the so - called higgstrahlung , @xmath17 , and the @xmath14 fusion , @xmath15 reactions . while the associated production of the higgs boson with a @xmath18 has a number of advantages , including the possibility to tag the presence of the higgs boson independent on its decay modes , @xmath14 fusion reaches the largest cross sections , due to its @xmath19 rise , if large enough centre - of - mass energies can be obtained .",
    "this makes the @xmath14 fusion process of special interest for the study of rare higgs decays , such as @xmath20 at large higgs boson masses , and @xmath16 .",
    "but as the energy increases , the @xmath1 production cross section is more and more peaked along the beam axis . above @xmath8",
    "3  tev , the further increase in production cross section is effectively lost , due to the limited detector acceptance in the very forward region .",
    "the production cross section at 3  tev and 5  tev is respectively 2.3 and 3.0 times larger compared to that at 1  tev .",
    "however , restricting the acceptance to higgs bosons produced at @xmath21 0.99 ( 0.92 ) , the gains in cross section become 2.1 ( 1.7 ) and 2.4 ( 1.9 ) , respectively .",
    "the possibility of achieving @xmath0 collisions at multi - tev energies , introduced by the clic concept  @xcite , offers a real opportunity for observing this decay and measuring @xmath13 with enough accuracy to perform a significant test of the scaling of the yukawa couplings in the lepton sector over a broad range of higgs boson masses  @xcite .",
    "multi - tev @xmath0 collisions become important not only for exploring the highest energy frontier but also for precision studies of suppressed higgs decays .",
    "signal events @xmath22 , @xmath16 are generated with pythia 6.205  @xcite , including beamsstrahlung effects , at several higgs boson mass values from 120  gev up to 160  gev .",
    "cross sections are computed using comphep 4.4.0  @xcite and the higgs decay branching fractions with hdecay  @xcite . at @xmath2 = 3  tev ,",
    "the effective @xmath15 production cross section , accounting for initial state radiation , is 0.48  pb to 0.45  pb and the decay branching fraction , br(@xmath16 ) = 2.56@xmath2310@xmath24 to 6.47@xmath2310@xmath25 , for @xmath11 in the range from 120  gev to 150  gev .",
    "the irreducible @xmath26 background is generated with comphep 4.4.0 interfaced with pythia 6.205 .",
    "the total cross section of events with an invariant mass of the @xmath27 system , @xmath28 , in the range 100  gev @xmath29 400  gev is 5.31  fb .",
    "we assume to operate clic at centre of mass energy of 3  tev for a total integrated luminosity of 5  ab@xmath3 , which corresponds to @xmath8  eight years ( 1 yr = 10@xmath30  s ) of operation at its nominal luminosity of 6.5@xmath2310@xmath31  @xmath32  s@xmath3 .",
    "the clic anticipated parameters are given in  @xcite , for this analysis we use the luminosity spectrum as in  @xcite .",
    "this provides with @xmath8  2.3@xmath2310@xmath33 @xmath15 events , 620 to 150 of which are followed by the @xmath16 decay , depending on the value of the higgs bosons mass in the range from 120  gev to 150  gev .",
    "the machine induced background , which affects this analysis most , is due to parasitic @xmath4 events occurring within the same time - stamp as a physics event .",
    "the anticipated average number of such events for the clic parameters is 3.2  bx@xmath3 , or 161 events within a 25  ns time - stamp .",
    "@xmath34 collisions are simulated using the guineapig program  @xcite and the cross sections parametrised according to  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic final states are simulated using pythia and overlayed to a signal event .",
    "the average visible energy deposited in the detector by @xmath4 events is @xmath8  90  gev / bx .",
    "charged particles are reconstructed in a multi - layered main tracker , made of high resolution silicon strip detectors , and a precision vertex tracker in a 5  t solenoidal field .",
    "discrete si tracking , following the example of the cms experiment at lhc , emerged as an appealing solution for clic , where local hit occupancy and two - track separation may limit the applicability of gaseous trackers  @xcite .",
    "a large magnetic field is beneficial for ensuring an excellent momentum resolution for high @xmath35 particle tracks , as well as for confining low momentum charged particles from machine - induced backgrounds to small radii .",
    "this analysis is based on an implementation of the sid detector  @xcite , developed as a concept for the international linear collider ( ilc ) project , for the reconstruction of 3  tev @xmath0 events .",
    "the sid concept has a five - layered si main tracker which ensures a momentum resolution @xmath36 5@xmath2310@xmath25 and polar angle coverage down to 8.3@xmath37 .",
    "the following assumptions on the detector response are made : the detection efficiency is 0.98 per layer , the point resolution 7  @xmath38 m , which includes alignment effects , and the detector is capable of time - stamping hits with 25  ns resolution , corresponding to 50 bunch crossings ( bx ) .",
    "while the sid is designed for the reconstruction of events at centre - of - mass energies below 1  tev , its geometry is well suited for the study of simple events , as those of our signal , up to multi - tev energies .",
    "full event simulation is performed using the sid model implemented in the mokka 06 - 03 program  @xcite based on geant-4  @xcite .",
    "simulation results are saved in the lcio format  @xcite and used as input to the event reconstruction .",
    "this is performed using a set of dedicated processors implemented in the marlin reconstruction and analysis framework  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction starts from hits generated in the sensitive layers along the track .",
    "the track pattern recognition is performed from the outermost main tracker hits and extends inwards to the vertex tracker . after the first stage of pattern recognition hit bundles",
    "are fitted using a simple helix .",
    "a second stage pattern recognition is performed using hits left unassociated after the first stage .",
    "reconstructed particle tracks are requested to have more than 4 hits and associated hits on at least 70  % of the number of sensitive surfaces traversed , depending on their polar angle , @xmath39 , @xmath40 fit probability in excess of 0.01 , @xmath41 0.98 , and impact parameter significance below 3.5  times the extrapolation resolution , in both coordinates .",
    "these cuts remove poorly measured particle tracks .",
    "the momentum resolution of the reconstructed muon tracks is @xmath42 = ( 3.46 @xmath43 0.10)@xmath2310@xmath25 , in agreement with the sid specifications .",
    "events with two , oppositely charged muon candidate tracks with momentum exceeding 10  gev and below 750  gev and event energy in charged particles 100  gev @xmath44 1.5  tev are selected .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of the selected di - muon pairs is shown in figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "the distribution is fitted with a gaussian curve to describe the signal and an exponential background .",
    "the mass resolution @xmath45 for signal events is 0.0034 , which corresponds to 0.40  gev for @xmath11=120  gev .",
    "the signal region is defined by a @xmath43  2  @xmath46 interval around the fitted mass peak position and a binned @xmath40 fit is performed to extract the number of signal and background events .",
