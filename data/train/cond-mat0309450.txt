    "three decades ago , michael rice and collaborators have introduced nonlinear phase excitations of a charge  density  wave condensate as a new type of charged states and referred to them as @xmath7 particles @xcite .",
    "their arguments were based on the peierls instability of a one  dimensional coupled electron  phonon system , in the limit where the charge  density wave amplitude is much smaller than the average electronic charge density .",
    "shortly after , hubbard discussed qualitatively the role of dimer pairs ( domain boundaries ) in a nearly quarter  filled band with dominant long  range coulomb interactions @xcite . as we will argue , the two types of charged states are closely related .",
    "we consider a one  dimensional system of spinless fermions described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fermionic creation and annihilation operators , respectively , @xmath11 is the occupation number of site @xmath12 and @xmath13 represents the long  range coulomb potential .",
    "such a model may describe molecular chain compounds where the interaction between two ( valence ) electrons on the same molecule is so large that double occupancy can safely be discarded .",
    "the spin quantum number is then redundant because the exchange of two electrons is dynamically forbidden .",
    "we have in mind systems where the average site occupation is a rational number between 0 and 1 , @xmath14 .",
    "depending on the band filling the fermions then represent either electrons or holes .",
    "the classical ground state ( @xmath2 ) is charge  ordered and forms a `` generalized wigner lattice '' @xcite . in the special case @xmath3 the unit cell contains @xmath4 sites , one of which is occupied .",
    "a generalized wigner lattice is clearly insulating and therefore the long  range coulomb interactions remain unscreened . insulating charge ",
    "ordered phases have been reported for organic chain compounds @xcite and in several cases the nature of charge ordering is more likely that of a wigner crystal than that of a ( small amplitude ) charge  density wave .",
    "we have recently used a variational wave function for describing the effects of a small but finite hopping term ( @xmath15 ) @xcite . here",
    "we consider the same regime , but follow a different route by examining the stability of the classical ground state ( the generalized wigner lattice ) with respect to the spontaneous generation of charge defects , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of electron - phonon interactions .",
    "such defects occur in pairs ( kinks and antikinks ) and can be viewed as fractionally charged particles , in close analogy to the @xmath7 particles of michael rice .",
    "we start our discussion for a density @xmath16 . in order to guarantee overall charge neutrality",
    "we introduce a rigid compensating background ( @xmath16 charge of opposite sign at each site ) .",
    "the classical ground state in this case corresponds to alternating filled and empty sites ( fig .",
    "note that this configuration , already at the classical level , is doubly degenerate , since exchanging the empty and occupied sites does not change the overall energy .",
    "the most simple defect in this perfect structure , called _",
    "kink _ in the following , is a domain boundary separating the two possible ground state configurations .",
    "it can be visualized as a pair of occupied nearest neighbor sites ( a dimer ) and is necessarily accompanied by an _ antikink _ , a pair of empty nearest  neighbor sites .    .",
    "dots / crosses stand for filled / empty sites respectively .",
    "the kinks and anti - kinks correspond to the shaded areas .",
    "the arrows indicate the hopping processes leading to a given configuration.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the classical energy of a kink  antikink pair is readily evaluated . introducing a pair of size @xmath17 , _",
    "i.e. _  a kink and an antikink separated by a distance @xmath17 ( see fig .  1 ) , costs an energy @xmath18 .\\ ] ] this sum can be transformed into a power series in @xmath19 with leading terms @xmath20 here the first term represents the creation energy of two well separated defects .",
    "the second term is the coulomb attraction between kink and antikink with a coupling reduced by a factor of 4 as compared to the original hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "therefore the defects carry effective charges @xmath21 ( measured in units of the electronic charge ) .",
    "this result agrees with what one obtains by adding or subtracting an electron to the classical ground state configuration @xcite .",
    "in fact , adding an electron at an empty site results in a high  energy configuration with a three  electron cluster .",
    "the energy is lowered by moving away one of these electrons , thus creating a pair of defects ( two kinks in our language ) .",
    "since the overall added charge is -1 , each kink carries a charge -1/2 .",
    "similarly , removing an electron produces two antikinks , each of which carries a charge + 1/2 . the third term in eq .",
    "[ eq : kk - approx ] can be interpreted as the interaction of two dipole moments pointing in opposite directions parallel to the chain axis .",
    "the size of the dipoles is equal to the fractional charge times half a lattice constant , in our units @xmath22 .",
    "we conclude that kinks and antikinks behave like fractionally charged particles with electric dipole moments .",
    "the dominant interaction is the coulomb attraction , even at the shortest possible distance @xmath23 .",
    "we now turn to the quantum problem of a defect pair , _",
    "i.e. _  we diagonalize the hamiltonian within the subspace of states @xmath24 , corresponding to a kink at site @xmath25 and an antikink at site @xmath26 ( @xmath27 thus indicates the center - of - mass of the pair ) . in general the effect of a hopping event on the state @xmath24",
    "is either to move an existing defect by two lattice sites , which modifies both the size ( @xmath28 ) and the center ( @xmath29 ) of the pair ( see fig .  1 ) , or to create ( annihilate ) an additional pair . restricting ourselves to the subspace of single  pair states , creation and annihilation processes are forbidden and the quantum problem reduces to the eigenvalue equation    @xmath30 |m , d\\rangle    + t\\    [   & & |m-1,d+1\\rangle + |m+1,d-1\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\     + & &   |m+1,d+1\\rangle + |m-1,d-1\\rangle ] = 0\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : pair - quantum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the center  of  mass and relative motions can be separated by introducing the bloch superposition @xmath31 introducing this ansatz into eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair - quantum ] ) leads to the following eigenvalue equation for the wave function @xmath32 , @xmath33\\ , \\;\\ ;   d\\ge 1\\ .\\ ] ] seeking for the lowest  energy wave function we restrict ourselves to the pair at rest ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the classical ground state ( no defect pairs ) is excluded by imposing the boundary condition @xmath35 .",
    "this eigenvalue problem can be treated to arbitrary accuracy numerically , but more insight is gained by solving it in the continuum limit , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the position in units of the distance between neighboring sites . neglecting the dipolar interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kk - approx ] ) we obtain the eigenvalue equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "( [ eq : eigenv - continuum ] ) is equal to the radial eigenvalue equation of the hydrogen problem in the s - wave channel , and the boundary conditions are also the same , @xmath35",
    ". therefore we can immediately write down the lowest  energy wave function of a pair , @xmath41 with an effective bohr radius @xmath42 and an energy @xmath43 when the interaction strength is lower than the critical value @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the formation of a kink - antikink pair becomes favorable by virtue of the gain in energy achieved through delocalization as a bloch state .",
    "is larger than the average distance between particles , a condition that is well satisfied at the critical coupling @xmath46 . indeed , solving the original discrete problem of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenvalue ] ) numerically yields @xmath47 , which is very close to the continuum estimate . ]    at the critical interaction strength the wigner lattice will be destabilized due to a proliferation of kink  antikink pairs , but we do not expect a true transition to a one  dimensional metallic state ( a luttinger liquid ) , because for arbitrarily small @xmath0 the system is unstable with respect to a charge  density wave with the same period as for the wigner lattice @xcite .",
    "therefore the critical strength @xmath46 indicates a crossover between a wigner lattice and small  amplitude charge ",
    "density wave .",
    "note that in the crossover region the binding energy @xmath48 makes a negligible correction to the quantum mechanical energy of a pair : the main contributions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : epair ] ) are the delocalization energy @xmath49 , and the formation energy of the isolated defects @xmath50 .",
    "we extend now the considerations of the previous section to other filling factors @xmath51 . for a general value of @xmath52 already the classical limit ( @xmath2 )",
    "is quite involved , leading to complicated charge patterns @xcite .",
    "therefore it is worthwhile to make contact to the opposite limit , @xmath53 , where a simple picture is available .",
    "mean  field theory applied to the hamiltonian ( 1 ) yields a ground state with a modulated charge density @xmath54 where @xmath55 in the case of spinless fermions , and @xmath56 for @xmath53 .",
    "the phase @xmath57 is an arbitrary constant for an incommensurate situation ( @xmath52 irrational ) , but locked to one of @xmath4 possible values in the commensurate case , where @xmath14 with integer numbers @xmath58 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "adding an electron to an incommensurate charge ",
    "density wave results in a slight shift of the wave vector @xmath59 , @xmath60q$ ] , where @xmath61 is the chain length . in view of eq .",
    "( [ cdw ] ) , this effect can also be attributed to a phase shift @xmath62 . for a commensurate case",
    "the phase achieves the change of @xmath63 from @xmath64 to @xmath65 through @xmath4 steps , _",
    "i.e. _  there are @xmath4 @xmath6particles , each of which carries a fractional charge @xmath66 .    .",
    "the symbols are the same as in figure 1.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    let us now return to the large @xmath0 limit and restrict ourselves to simple ratios @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the classical ground state is @xmath4fold degenerate and there are several types of domain walls separating the different configurations .",
    "it turns out that the low  energy domain walls are those which connect nearby ground state configurations , _",
    "i.e. _  wigner lattices where the locations of electrons differ by one lattice constant ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "these `` kink '' and `` antikink '' defects again occur in pairs . repeating the arguments of the steps of the previous section , we evaluate the classical energy of a kink  antikink pair of size @xmath68 , @xmath69    the summation can again be performed for large sizes , and we find up to first order in @xmath70 @xmath71 -\\frac{v}{s^2}\\frac{1}{sd}\\ .",
    "\\label{s - energy}\\ ] ] the first term , the pair creation energy @xmath72 at infinite separation , agrees with the corresponding quantity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kk - approx ] ) for @xmath73 .",
    "the second term corresponds to the coulomb attraction for two particles with fractional charges @xmath74 at a distance @xmath68 , in agreement with the counting argument presented above for the @xmath6particles .",
    "we can again use the continuum limit for calculating the lowest  energy quantum pair state for general @xmath4 . the wave function",
    "is again given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf - continuum ] ) , but with a bohr radius @xmath75 thus the pair size increases strongly with decreasing density @xmath3 . correspondingly , the binding energy decreases , as seen in the pair energy @xmath76 where the first two terms dominate for large @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath77 we can safely use the asymptotic value @xmath78 to estimate the instability point , where this energy becomes negative .",
    "the result , @xmath79 agrees well with our previous variational estimate @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising because the creation of a pair can be achieved through a hopping event that moves a particle out of the ground state configuration .",
    "the probability of such a hopping event was evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was used to determine a criterion for the instability of the generalized wigner lattice .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath16 , for lower density this instability does not signal a crossover to a small  amplitude charge  density wave , it rather indicates that part of the electronic charge is spilled over to neighboring sites of the classical wigner lattice .",
    "in this paper we have determined the lowest  energy quantum state of a kink  antikink pair in a one  dimensional generalized wigner lattice .",
    "we have calculated the critical value @xmath46 of the interaction strength below which the pair energy is negative , and charge defects will be generated spontaneously .",
    "kinks ( or antikinks ) are the strong  coupling analogs of the @xmath6particles studied a long time ago by michael rice and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the true quantum ground state of electrons interacting through long  range coulomb forces contains kink  antikink pairs due to quantum fluctuations , even above @xmath46 .",
    "it would be interesting to proceed from the single ",
    "pair solution to that of an arbitrary number of pairs .",
    "this step is highly non  trivial , although at first sight it looks similar to that from the cooper problem to the bcs wave function .",
    "one of the difficulties arises from the unknown statistics of kinks and antikinks , another from their non  local character .",
    "if the density of pairs in the ground state is large enough , they loose their identity , and kinks and antikinks may move rather independently . in this case",
    "one can imagine a d.c .",
    "charge transport due to moving defects .",
    "whether such a mechanism is responsible for the observed drude peak in the bechgaard salts @xcite is an interesting open question .",
    "one of us ( s.f . ) would like to thank p. qumerais for suggesting the idea of defect pairs describing the melting of the classically ordered state .",
