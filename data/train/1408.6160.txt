    "the antiferromagnetic mott - insulator lamno@xmath0 is famous for being the mother compound@xcite of a large family of doped perovskites ( @xmath7mno@xmath0 with @xmath8 = trivalent rare - earth ion , @xmath9 = divalent alkali earth ca , sr , ba ) showing a variety of interesting physical properties like colossal magnetoresistance,@xcite charge / orbital ordering,@xcite and multiferroicity.@xcite these interesting physical properties arise from the complex interplay of spin , orbital , charge and structure degrees of freedom which is triggered by the jahn - teller ( jt ) active mn@xmath4 ions in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the fivefold degenerate @xmath10-levels of mn@xmath4 are split by the cubic crystal field in octahedral oxygen coordination into a lower @xmath11-triplet , half occupied by three electrons , and a higher @xmath3-doublet , occupied by a single electron only .",
    "the residual degeneracy of the @xmath3-doublet is lifted by the cooperative jahn - teller distortion of the mno@xmath12 octahedra within the orthorhombic ( @xmath13 ) structure.@xcite the corresponding orbital order accounts for an @xmath9-type antiferromagnetism with a nel temperature @xmath14  k. the cooperative jahn - teller derived orbital order survives up to @xmath15  k. at this temperature lamno@xmath0 undergoes a structural transition from the orbitally ordered @xmath16 to the orbitally disordered @xmath17 phase which is nearly cubic.@xcite the transition from the @xmath16 phase to the @xmath17 phase is accompanied by a volume collapse of 0.36%@xcite which does not change the mn - o bond length.@xcite    the volume collapse , together with step - like anomalies in other experimental quantities like electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility@xcite indicates a first - order character of the jt transition .",
    "this was corroborated by the theoretical treatment of the anharmonic coupling between the pseudospin of the mn@xmath4 @xmath3 states , the staggered jt distortion , and the volume strain coordinate.@xcite moreover it was shown that the first - order transition transforms into a second - order one dependent on the model parameters and was experimentally realized by doping experiments .",
    "this finding was supported by results obtained from different experimental techniques on la@xmath18sr@xmath19mno@xmath0 single crystals , a series of sr - doped powder samples and lamno@xmath0 thin films.@xcite besides this general assessment concerning the character of the jt transition , the dynamical properties observed in a rather broad temperature range around @xmath1 deserve a closer inspection .",
    "recent nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments@xcite show changes in the spin - relaxation and the knight - shift of the @xmath20o ligand ions already far below @xmath1 , which are interpreted as a melting of the orbital order .",
    "but as the observed magnetic shift at the @xmath20o - site is related to the so called `` short range effect '' the upturn of the echo decay rate may also be a signature of the disapperence of short range spin order .",
    "moreover , a peak in the temperature dependence of transverse relaxation rate at the oxygen sites ( @xmath21 ) at @xmath22  k indicates collective excitations above @xmath1 , matching non - zero local distortions found by neutron diffraction and x - ray absorption measurements.@xcite in contrast to the nmr and studies of the crystal structure , the esr linewidth is directly determined by the on - site crystal field parameters d and e and , thus , is not related to short range spin - order effects .",

    "the anisotropy of esr resonance field and linewidth observed in the orbitally ordered @xmath23 phase is in good agreement with the results obtained earlier in lightly sr doped crystals .",
    "the high - temperature data bear further important information on the orbital degrees of freedom close to the structural transition . besides a rather abrupt breakdown of the anisotropy on crossing @xmath24  k into the @xmath17 phase",
    ", we find evidence for a change of the anisotropic interactions already above @xmath25  k indicating the onset of strong orbital fluctuations at temperatures far below the structural transition at @xmath1 .",
    "usually two types of interactions are considered to be responsible for the transition at @xmath26 : orbital dependent superexchange and the jahn - teller coupling with concomitant local distortions .",

    "due to large temperature gradients at high temperatures the sample temperature is corrected by calibration measurements at the actual sample site in the high - temperature cavity . to check the influence of different environmental conditions and temperature on the oxygen content of the samples at high temperatures , measurements have been performed in pure ar at 0.7 bar pressure adjusted at room temperature and in air ( open quartz tube ) for polycrystalline samples .",

    "the polycrystalline data match well those of the single - crystal , both concerning the transition temperature and the absolute value in the @xmath17-phase where the linewidth does not depend on the orientation of the magnetic field any more .",
    "moreover , we recognize that the linewidth data in the @xmath17-phase coincide with the dm contribution determined independently in the @xmath23 phase . here",
    "we recall that , due to the fact that the @xmath40-factor anisotropy already fixes the ratio @xmath52 , the linewidth anisotropy yields basically the strength of the relaxation contributions @xmath64 and @xmath66 under the assumption that the dm contribution is approximately isotropic .",

    "[ eqn : eq3 ] it is important to note that the dotted line @xmath89 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dh ] has been calculated using a curie - weiss law for @xmath90 with a curie - weiss temperature @xmath91  k as measured from the susceptibility data in the @xmath23 phase .",
    "indeed , the susceptibility significantly changes at @xmath1 to a higher curie - weiss temperature of about @xmath92  k.@xcite hence , the contribution @xmath89 is expected to drop by about 10% at @xmath1 as indicated by the green dotted line .",
    "this suggests that even above @xmath1 the experimental linewidth still contains a non - zero crystal - field contribution due to residual distortions .",
    "unfortunately , corresponding zero - field splitting parameters can not be obtained from a possible anisotropy within experimental uncertainty .",
    "residual distortions have been indicated by neutron - diffraction , as well .",
    "however , also the neutron data do not appear to be fully conclusive : on one hand one has to conclude that @xmath93 goes to zero , but @xmath94 does not , as the difference between the orbital mixing coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 reduces upon heating and finally approaches zero at @xmath1.@xcite on the other hand it is known that the cf parameters are very sensitive to the local distortion modes of the mno@xmath12 octahedra , i.e. , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "keeping in mind this correlation , we can see from fig .  5 of wdowik _ _ et al.__@xcite and fig .  5 of chatterji _ _ et al.__@xcite that only @xmath99 and , therefore , the parameter @xmath46 vanishes at @xmath100 , but @xmath47 does not .",
    "it is only strongly reduced above the phase transition , but remains at a finite small value .",
    "this apparent antagonism indicates that the behavior close to the phase transition at @xmath1 is more complicated and the applied models are oversimplified .    for a detailed analysis of the esr relaxation behavior close to @xmath1",
    "we remind that in the kubo - tomita approach , apart from any phase transition , the general temperature dependence of the esr linewidth stems from the spin susceptibility following@xcite @xmath101 with the `` reduced '' high - temperature linewidth @xmath102 which is determined only by the ratio of the second moment @xmath103 \\ , [ s^- , { \\cal h}_{\\textrm{aniso } } ] \\rangle } { \\langle s^+ s^- \\rangle}\\ ] ] of the esr spectrum due to any anisotropic interaction @xmath104 and the isotropic exchange constant @xmath105 .",
    "thus , inserting the single - ion curie susceptibility @xmath106 the product @xmath107 should be constant with temperature in case of temperature independent local interactions .",

    "[ fig : rdh ] , is calculated by the product of the linewidth measured in the powder sample , the susceptibility and the temperature .",
    "although the reduced linewidth is not temperature independent , we can clearly distinguish the weakly temperature - dependent regime between room temperature and @xmath2 = 550  k , from that at higher temperature where the linear slope of the reduced linewidth becomes steeper , before the jump at the jt transition occurs .",
    "interestingly , the slope for @xmath110 is the same as for @xmath111 up to about 900  k and levels off at higher temperatures , only .",
    "indeed , the reduced linewidth decreases by about 10% from 750  k to 900  k , which is just the excess contribution found from the extrapolation of the dm contribution from the @xmath23 phase into the @xmath17 phase .",
    "thus , taking into account that the dm interaction mainly depends on the tilting angle and the mn - o bond length , which is not significantly changing with temperature,@xcite we assign the remaining temperature dependent excess contribution of the linewidth to the zero - field splitting contribution which reflects the orbital occupation .",
    "the temperature @xmath2 = 550  k coincides with the observation of a change at the @xmath20o - site of the temperature dependence of the nmr knight shift and the transverse relaxation rate ( @xmath21 ) recently reported.@xcite moreover , a recent theoretical study estimated the orbital ordering temperature due to the kugel - khomskii superexchange mechanism as @xmath112  k,@xcite coinciding with @xmath2 . to explain the experimental value of @xmath24  k in their calculation these authors need to include the jahn - teller coupling.@xcite a quantitative analysis of the interaction between the mn@xmath4-ions via the elastic field",
    "is given in the appendix , where the interaction strengths via the elastic ( phonon ) field for ferro- and antiferrodistortive coupled mn - ions lying in the @xmath6-plane and along the @xmath5-axis are compared , respectively .",
    "as a result we find that orbital ordering in the @xmath6-plane is more stable ( by a factor of @xmath113 ) than along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "this means that a temperature - induced melting of the orbital order is most likely to occur first along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "we therefore suggest from our esr results that at @xmath114  k the three - dimensional orbital ordering starts to melt , but the two - dimensional orbital ordering within the @xmath6-planes remains intact up to @xmath24  k. above 750  k the long - range orbital order is released , but short - range order fluctuations survive up to 900  k. this shows , that the interaction via the elastic field is one of the fundamental interactions defining the orbital order in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "this interaction has been missed in the previous discussion@xcite and may improve the findings from theoretical studies in this system .",
    "we believe that such a scenario of partial melting might also be realized in the layered dimer system sr@xmath0cr@xmath115o@xmath116 , where a cooperative jt distortion occurs already at 285  k , but strong lattice and orbital fluctuations persist down to about 120  k.@xcite",

    "<S> this temperature scale is discussed with respect to the interaction of the @xmath3-electrons of the mn@xmath4-ions and the elastic field of the cooperative distortions . </S>",
