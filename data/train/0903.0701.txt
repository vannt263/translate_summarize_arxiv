    "zhao and his group [ 1 ] found an experimental evidence of superconductivity in multi - walled nanotubes ( mwnt ) with the critical temperature @xmath0 k after examining the paramagnetic meissner effect [ 2 ] .",
    "this is a new record of high @xmath1 , about eight times higher than @xmath2 k found in mercury - based cuprates [ 3 ] .",
    "fujita and godoy developed a quantum statistical theory of superconductivity [ 4 ] , extending the bardeen ",
    "shrieffer ( bcs ) theory [ 5 ] by incorporating lattice and band structures of electrons and phonons and considering moving cooper pairs .",
    "the cooper pairs [ 6 ] , called the pairons , are formed by the phonon - exchange attraction .",
    "these pairons move with linear dispersion relations , see eq .",
    "( 2 ) [ 4 ] .",
    "the centers of mass ( cm ) of pairons move as bosons [ 4 ] .",
    "these pairons undergo a bose  einstein condensation ( bec ) in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "we use the quantum statistical theory to support a superconductivity in mwnt at high temperatures ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "et al_. [ 7 ] showed that the graphene is supercunducting at 1.7 k. we discuss this in section ii .",
    "the graphene sheet can be wrapped into a carbon nanotube .",
    "the  holes \" ( and not the  electrons \" ) can go through inside the positively charged graphene wall . due to this extra channel the nanotube s majority carriers are  holes \" although the graphene s majority carriers are  electrons \" , see section iii . in mwnt",
    "the  holes \" are generated more abundantly between the graphene walls .",
    "we discuss the superconductivity at ultrahigh critical temperatures in section iv .",
    "summary and discussion are given in section v.",
    "in graphene carbon ions ( c@xmath4 ) occupy the two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb crystal lattice .",
    "we assume that the  electron \" (  hole \" ) wave packet has a negative ( positive ) charge @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 and a size extending over the unit c - hexagon .",
    "the positively charged  hole \" tends to stay away from positive ions c@xmath4 and hence its charge is concentrated at the center of the hexagon .",
    "the negatively charged  electron \" tends to stay close to the c@xmath4 ions and its charge is concentrated near the c@xmath4 hexagon . because of the different internal charge distributions , the  electron \" and  hole \" should have different effective masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for the description of the electron motion in terms of the mass tensor , it is convenient to introduce cartesian coordinates , which may not necessarily match with the crystal s natural ( triangular ) axes .",
    "electron \" may move easily with a smaller effective mass in the direction [ 110 ] than perpendicular to it as we see presently . here",
    "we use the conventional miller indices for the hexagonal lattice with omission of the c - axis index",
    ". we may choose the unit cell as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the choice is not unique . but",
    "the size of the rectangle with side - length pair ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) for any unit cell is the same .",
    "then , the brillouin zone in the @xmath12-space is unique : a rectangle with side length ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "the  electron \" ( wave packet ) may move up or down to the neighboring hexagon sites passing over one c@xmath4 .",
    "the positively charged c@xmath4 acts as a welcome potential valley for the negatively charged  electron \" . the same c@xmath4 acts as a hindering potential hill for the positively charged  hole \" .",
    "the  hole \" can move easily over on a series of vacant sites , each surrounded by six c@xmath4 , without meeting the hindering potential hills .",
    "thus , the easy channel direction for the  electrons \" and  hole \" are [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] , respectively .",
    "let us consider the system ( graphene ) at 0 k. if we put an electron in the crystal , then the electron should occupy the center o of the brillouin zone , where the lowest energy lies .",
    "additional electrons occupy points neighboring o in consideration of pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "the electron distribution is lattice - periodic over the entire crystal in accordance with the bloch theorem .",
    "the graphene is quadrivalent metal .",
    "the first few low - lying bands in the @xmath12-space are completely filled .",
    "the uppermost partially filled bands are important for the transport properties discussion .",
    "we consider such a band .",
    "the fermi surface which defines the boundary between the filled and unfilled @xmath12-spaces ( areas ) is not a circle since the @xmath15-@xmath16 symmetry is broken .",
    "the effective mass @xmath8 is less in the direction [ 110 ] than perpendicular to it .",
    "if the electron number is raised by the gate voltage , then the fermi surface more quickly grows in the easy - axis ( y- ) direction than in the @xmath15-direction .",
    "the fermi surface must approach the brillouin boundary at right angles because of the inversion symmetry possessed by the honeycomb lattice .",
    "hence , the fermi surface must touch the brillouin boundary at a certain voltage and a  neck \" fermi surface must be developed .",
    "the same easy channels in which the  electron \" runs with a small mass , may be assumed for other hexagonal directions , [ 011 ] and [ 101 ] .",
    "hence , the system does not show anisotropy .",
    "experiments [ 7 ] indicate that ( a ) both  electrons \" and  hole \" can be excited in graphene , ( b ) at zero gate voltage the  electrons \" are dominant , ( c ) the resistivity @xmath17 exhibits a sharp maximum at the  electrons \" density @xmath18 @xmath19 , and ( d ) the mobility @xmath20 proportional to the conductivity @xmath21 shoot up at the  hole \" density @xmath22 @xmath19 . the feature ( b ) should arise from the existence of the welcoming ion c@xmath4 for the  electrons \" ( and not for the holes ) . the feature ( c ) is due to the fact that the conductivity , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the relaxation time , must decrease since the effective mass @xmath25 shoots up to @xmath26 in the small-neck \" limit .",
    "the feature ( d ) means that the graphene is superconducting at 1.7 k. in our quantum statistical theory the pairons are generated through the phonon exchange attraction .",
    "since the phonon carries no charge , the system before and after the phonon exchange has the same charge state , requiring that positively and negatively charge pairons are created in equal numbers simultaneously .",
    "the graphene s majority carriers are  electrons \" at zero gate voltage .",
    "the mobility - maximum occurs on the  hole \" gate voltage side where the  hole \" density is high near the  neck \" fermi surface .",
    "the  necks \" can occur for both ",
    "electrons \" and  holes \" sides .",
    "there is a @xmath17-maximum for the  electron \" side and a @xmath20-maximum for the hole side at 1.7 k. why is the asymmetry ?",
    "the @xmath20-maxium means that the phonon exchange is in action .",
    "there are not many  holes \" and hence the critical temperature @xmath1 is very low on the electron side .",
    "if the system is observed at lower temperatures , it should then show superconductivity states on both sides .",
    "let us now consider a long nanotube wrapped with the graphene sheet .",
    "the charge may be transported by the channeling  electrons \" and  holes \" in the graphene wall .",
    "but the  holes \" present inside the nanotube can also contribute to the charge transport .",
    "the carbon ions in the wall are positively charged .",
    "hence , the positively charged  hole \" can go through inside the tube .",
    "in contrast , the negatively charged  electrons \" are attracted by the carbon wall and can not go straight through the tube . because the extra - channel inside the carbon nanotube,holes \" are the dominant charge carriers in the nanotube .",
    "we predict the superconductivity states for the nanotube with @xmath1 greater than 1.7 k.",
    "a graphene sheat can be rolled like a wallpaper to produce a multiwalled nanotube ( mwnt ) .",
    "the tube diameter may reach 50  .",
    "recently , zhao and his group [ 3 ] found an evidence of superconductivity of a ultrahigh critical temperature ( 1275 k ) .",
    "the pairons move in two dimensions ( 2d ) with a linear dispersion relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the negative ground state energy , @xmath29 the pairon momentum magnitude , and @xmath30 the fermi velocity of type @xmath31 , @xmath32 (  electron \" ) , @xmath33 (  hole \" ) .",
    "this relation is obtained , starting with a bcs - like hamiltonian , setting up and solving an energy - eigenvalue problem for the moving pairon , see reference [ 4 ] .",
    "these pairons move similar to massless particles with the common speed ( @xmath34 ) @xmath30 .    in graphene the  electron \" pairons , having the greater speed ,",
    "dominate the transport and the bec . the critical ( superconducting ) temperature @xmath1 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pairon density . briefly",
    "the bec occurs when the chemical potential vanishes at a finite @xmath37 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath1 can be determined from @xmath38^{-1 } , \\qquad \\beta_{c } \\equiv ( k_{b}t_{c})^{-1}.\\ ] ] after expanding the integrand in powers of @xmath39 and using @xmath40 , we obtain @xmath41 , yielding formula ( 3 ) with @xmath42 .",
    "experiments [ 8 ] indicate that the linear coefficient @xmath11 equals @xmath43 m / s , implying that the fermi velocity @xmath44 is approximately equal to @xmath45 ms@xmath46 . using eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we obtain the critical temperature @xmath0 k , for @xmath47 @xmath19 .",
    "the measurments of the satulation magnetization of mwnt bundle [ 1 ] yield the 3d electron density @xmath48 @xmath49 , which give a 2d density @xmath50 @xmath19 .",
    "the pairon density must be smaller than the electron density .",
    "hence , the quoted @xmath47 @xmath19 is reasonable",
    "we have shown , based on the quantum statistical theory , that a superconducting state exists in mwnt with a ultrahigh critical temperature ( @xmath3 k ) . the linear dispersion relation in eq .",
    "( 2 ) may be probed by the angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
