    "the reward from a target is fairly allocated to sensors covering the target .",
    "arsie et al .",
    "@xcite considered a game where each node @xmath15 attempts to maximize the expected value of the reward . here , each node @xmath15 receives the reward if node @xmath15 is the first to reach point @xmath461 , and the value of the reward is the time until the second node arrives , i.e. , @xmath467 @xmath468 was proved to be an epg .",
    "@xcite formulated a time slot assignment problem for immobile sensors , which is equivalent to a channel allocation problem , as @xmath469 , where each sensor @xmath38 selects a slot @xmath470 to maximize the area covered only by sensor @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath471 where @xmath472 is the sensing area covered by sensor @xmath14 .",
    "game @xmath473 was proved to be an epg with potential @xmath474 where @xmath475 corresponds to the average coverage .    to show the close relationship between the payoff functions ( [ eq : saloha_utility ] ) in the slotted aloha game @xmath463 and ( [ eq : coverage_continuous_utility ] ) in the coverage game @xmath476",
    ", we provide different expressions . using @xmath477 , we get @xmath478 where the surface integral is taken over the whole area .",
    "wang et al . @xcite further discussed this problem .",

    "@xcite applied the coverage game to camera networks .",

    "@xcite discussed a pan - tilt - zoom ( ptz ) camera network to track multiple targets .",
    "another potential game - theoretic ptz camera control scheme was proposed in @xcite , motivated by natural environmental monitoring .",
    "directional sensors were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the form of payoff functions is similar to ( [ eq : coverage_discrete_utility ] ) .    until now",
    ", each immobile sensor was assumed to receive a payoff when it covered a target alone .",
    "yen et al .",
    "@xcite discussed a game where each sensor receives a payoff when the number of sensors covering a target is smaller than or equal to the allowable number .",
    "since this game falls within a class of cgs , it is also an epg .",
    "we have provided a comprehensive survey of potential game approaches to wireless networks , including channel assignment problems and transmission power assignment problems .",
    "although there are a variety of payoff functions that have been proven to have potential , there are some representative forms , e.g. , bsi games and congestion games , and we have shown the relations between representative forms and individual payoff functions .",
    "we hope the relations shown in this paper will provide insights useful in designing wireless technologies .",
