    "disk galaxies are the main population of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the study of their global scaling relations is of paramount relevance for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies in general .",
    "the main disk ",
    "galaxy observed global scaling relations are those between maximum circular velocity , , and luminosity , @xmath0 ; between disk scale length , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 ; and between  and @xmath2 .",
    "each one of these relations can be established for different optical / near  ir ( nir ) pass  bands . under some assumptions , analogous relations can be calculated for the corresponding stellar and baryonic quantities .",
    "the changes in the zero points , slopes and scatters of these relations , when changing from one color band to another , and to stellar and baryonic quantities , are expected to be intimately related to the stellar  population properties and radial distributions of disk galaxies . in turn , these properties and distributions depend mainly on the disk assembly and star  formation ( hereafter sf ) histories .",
    "therefore , the study of the scale relations for different passbands and for the stellar and baryonic cases offers valuable information on the structural , dynamical and sf properties of disk galaxies , as well as important constraints on models of their formation and evolution .",
    "the present paper is focused on this study .",
    "the most robust and studied of the disk  galaxy scaling relations is the one between @xmath0 and , the so  called tully  fisher relation ( tfr ) . originally discovered in the @xmath3 passband ( tully & fisher 1977 ) , it was afterward shown that it also applies to infrared bands . more recently , after applying a velocity ( luminosity)dependent extinction correction , tully & pierce ( 2000 ) have confirmed that the slope of the @xmath0-@xmath11 correlation gets steeper systematically from @xmath3 ( @xmath12 ) to @xmath4 ( @xmath13 ) bands .",
    "this result suggests some dependence of galaxy colors on  for a given galaxy luminosity or mass .",
    "the amplitude of the scatter of the tfrs changes also with wavelength .",
    "these dependencies of the slope and scatter of the tfr on wavelength are related mainly to stellar population effects , which on their own , are related to the assembly and sf histories of galaxies . regarding the intrinsic tfr scatters ,",
    "they are found to be small , posing a challenge for scenarios aimed to explain the origin of disk galaxies ( eisenstein & loeb 1996 ; avila - reese et al .",
    "1998 ; mo et al . 1998 ; firmani & avila - reese 2000 ) .    the tfr has widely been studied for estimating extragalactic distances . in this case",
    "the independent variable ( predictor ) is the circular velocity , and the galaxy samples are carefully pruned to minimize the scatter .",
    "the latter implies a selection of samples for a narrow range of morphological types and surface brightnesses ( hereafter sbs ) .",
    "however , for studies that aim to understand the origin of the tfr and use it to constrain models of galaxy formation rather than circular velocity , the luminosity should be the predictor , and the sample should be as wide as possible in morphological types , sbs , and colors ( courteau et al . 2007 ) .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to the tfr as the -@xmath0(-@xmath6 ) correlation .    by using nir magnitudes which are good tracers of stellar masses and gas contents",
    "when available , some authors have calculated the stellar and baryonic tfrs ( e.g. , mcgaugh et al .",
    "2000 ; bell & de jong 2001 ; mayer & moore 2004 ; gurovich et al .",
    "2004 ; pizagno et al . 2005 ; de rijcke et al .",
    "2007 ) . as discussed in firmani & avila - reese ( 2000",
    "; hereafter fa - r ) , on one hand the baryonic tfr appears to be closely related to the cosmological halo maximum circular velocity  mass relation , and on the other hand , when compared to the stellar tfr , it reflects some aspects of the sf efficiency for different types of galaxies .",
    "the behavior of the scatter , when one changes from @xmath8 to @xmath14band tfrs and to the stellar and baryonic tfrs , certainly contains relevant information on the processes of disk galaxy evolution such as gas infall , sf , and stellar population histories .",
    "the radius for a given luminosity ( or the disk sb ) has been considered as a potential third parameter that correlates with the scatter of the tfr ( e.g. , kodaira 1989 ; willick 1999 ) .",
    "the scale length @xmath2 is indeed another structural parameter of disk galaxies that span a wide range of values .",
    "some authors have reported that the scatter of the tfr is reduced up to 50% when @xmath2 is introduced as a third parameter ( e.g. , koda , sofue & wada 2000 ; han et al .",
    "however , if the scatter of a given relation decreases upon introducing a third variable , it does not necessarily mean that such a variable is a statistically significant parameter .",
    "indeed , some authors have shown that @xmath2 ( or central sb ) is not a physical third parameter in the tfr ( e.g. , han 1991 ; tully & verheijen 1997 ; willick et al .",
    "1997 ; courteau & rix 1999 ; fa - r ) , but the radius could be a third parameter in the baryonic tfr ( fa - r ; avila - reese , firmani & zavala 2002 ; zavala 2003 ; dutton et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it is well known that the radius correlate with @xmath0 ( freeman 1970 ) and  ( tully & fisher 1977 ) , although these correlations are much more scattered than the tfr .",
    "disk galaxies in the log@xmath0log@xmath11log@xmath2 parameter  space indeed lie in a thin oblique plane whose edge  on projection is close to the log@xmath15log  ( tfr ) projection ( koda , sofue & wada 2000 ; han et al .",
    "2001 ; shen , mo & shu 2002 ; gnedin et al .",
    "this is the so called fundamental plane of disk galaxies .",
    "here we construct from observations and analyze separately each one of the three projections of these planes .      in most of the previous works , the disk ",
    "galaxy scaling correlations were constructed for samples biased in morphological types and sbs ( pruned for reducing the scatter ) , and without selecting the environment .",
    "however , _ for theoretical and interpretative studies , the observational galaxy sample should be as wide as possible in the range of morphologies , sbs , and colors _ in order to include the whole population of disk galaxies , later to be compared with model predictions .",
    "besides , since galaxy models are commonly used for isolated galaxies , the observational sample should also be selected to contain galaxies _ not affected by the environment_. on the other hand , the limited information of the samples employed in previous works , did not allow one to explore how the scaling correlations and their scatters change from luminous to stellar and baryonic quantities .    in this paper we shall use a sample of @xmath16 disk galaxies compiled from the literature and homogenized in zavala et al .",
    "( 2003a ; hereafter zahf ) and zavala ( 2003 ) .",
    "this sample is not in any sense complete , an aspect that is crucial for volume  averaged population studies ( e.g. , the luminosity function ) , but is less relevant for studies on the correlations of physical properties .",
    "the sample includes high and low sb ( hereafter hsb and lsb , respectively ) disk _ normal _ galaxies of all morphological types , and it provides photometric information , at least in @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands , as well as information on the rotation curve and the hi integrated flux .",
    "none of the previous related works have presented a sample with these characteristics , which are crucial for the analysis proposed here . by using this sample",
    ", we will explore the differences in the slope and scatter of each scaling relation defined in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands , and for stellar and baryonic quantities .",
    "the results of this exploration will be interpreted in the light of disk  galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "the current theory of galaxy formation and evolution is based on the hierarchical @xmath10 cold dark matter ( ) cosmological model ( for recent reviews , see baugh 2006 ; avila - reese 2007 ) .",
    "several authors have attempted to predict the scaling relations of disk galaxies and their scatters within this model ( e.g. , avila - reese et al .",
    "1998,2002 ; mo et al .",
    "1998 ; steinmetz & navarro 1999 ; navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; fa - r ; koda et al .",
    "2000 ; shen et al .",
    "2002 ; zavala 2003 ; courteau et al .",

    "2005,2007 ; gnedin et al .",
    "2007 ; courteau et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the results are encouraging .",
    "we shall use some of these results , mainly those of fa - r , to interpret and discuss the new inferences from observations presented here .",
    "note that it was a common practice in the literature to compare model results with the observed _ luminous _ properties and correlations , while most of the galaxy models did not actually include or self  consistently treat the process of gas transformation into stars , as well as did not follow the evolutionary path of halos and galaxies .",
    "as fa - r showed ( see also avila - reese et al .",
    "2002 ; dutton et al .",
    "2005 ) , on one hand , there are systematical differences in the predicted scaling relations and their scatters among the luminous , stellar , and baryonic quantities ; differences that we will explore here .",
    "on the other hand , properties such as the stellar and baryonic @xmath6 , @xmath2 , , gas fraction , and integral colors depend not only on the initial parameters , but also on the evolutionary path of the halo  disk system ( stringer & benson 2008 ) .",
    "contrary to the `` static population '' models , such as those of mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and extensions of them , the fa - r models are evolutionary . with some simplifications , they follow self  consistently ( see appendix b ) : the halo and disk assembly , taking into account the halo adiabatic contraction ; the self  regulated disk sf and feedback ; the luminosity evolution ; and the secular bulge formation .    during the completion of the present work , several of the papers mentioned above , with results and a philosophy similar to ours , appeared in the literature .",
    "although some overlapping is present , our contribution is original in the sense that we focus the research _ on the changes in the scaling relations and their scatters when moving from optical to nir bands and to stellar and baryonic quantities_. our sample is similar in number to others used in recent works ( e.g. , gnedin et al .",
    "2007 ) and smaller with respect to dutton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and courteau et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who use @xmath17 objects with @xmath18 band photometry and @xmath19 kinematics , but only @xmath20 out of them , mainly hsb galaxies , have available @xmath14 band photometry .",
    "these large samples are undoubtedly useful and we will compare , when possible , with their results . however , we can not use them because they lack several observables ( e.g. , gas content , optical photometry ) and requirements ( e.g. , inclination limits , lsb galaxies in both optical and @xmath4 bands ) that we have imposed for our study .",
    "we hope that our study will serve as a benchmark for similar analyzes based on large multiwavelength galaxy surveys , which are currently being completed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the disk galaxy sample to be used .",
    "the three main scaling correlations and their scatters are constructed and discussed in  3 for bands @xmath3 and @xmath4 and for the inferred stellar and baryonic quantities .",
    "some other correlations among global galaxy quantities are also reported . in  4 , in the light of previous based disk galaxy formation and evolution models , we interpret the changes in the slopes and scatters of the scaling relations when changing from @xmath3 to @xmath4 bands and to stellar and baryonic quantities .",
    "a summary of the results and the conclusions of this work are presented in  6 .",
    "in the literature there are only a few small galaxy samples with the requirements and data we need ( broad in morphological types and sbs , with information on detailed surface ",
    "photometry in two separated pass  bands , e.g. @xmath3 and @xmath4 , on global dynamics , and on total hi gas flux ) .",
    "here we use a compilation and completion of these samples presented in zahf and zavala ( 2003 ; see also graham 2002 ) . in the following , we present the sub ",
    "samples , describe the homogenization and data correction processes that we have implemented , and the way in which we calculated the stellar and baryonic quantities ( see zahf for additional details ) .    the sub ",
    "samples are : ( i ) de jong & van der kruit ( 1994 ; see also de jong 1996a ) , which comprises undisturbed field , mostly hsb , disk galaxies , ( ii ) verheijen ( 1997 ; see also verheijen & sancisi 2001 ) , composed of disk hsb and lsb galaxies from the least massive and most spiral  rich nearby cluster , ursa minor , and ( iii ) bell et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , a sample of lsb galaxies observed partially by them ; the rest were compiled from the literature , mainly from de blok et al .",
    "( 1995,1996 ) . in our sample",
    "we also included the milky way and andromeda galaxies .",
    "the raw photometric magnitudes , disk scale lengths , @xmath2 , and central sbs were taken directly from the source papers . in zahf and zavala ( 2003 )",
    "we have checked that there were no significant systematic differences in these parameters with inclination ; we also found no systematics due to the different completeness criteria and profile fitting procedures used by the original authors of each sub  sample .",
    "in fact , the dominant source of error in the photometric parameters is caused by the uncertainty in the sky level ( bell et al 2000 ; de jong 1996a ) . regarding the dynamical information , and to make the data as uniform as possible , we used the velocity line  width  ( defined at the 20% level ) for almost all the galaxies in the sample .",
    "only a few ( lsb ) galaxies in the sample lack a   measurement but have measured rotation curves ; in these cases we have used the  inferred directly from the rotation curve . if properly corrected ,  @xmath21 ( verheijen 1997 ; verheijen 2001 ) . for the verheijen sub ",
    "sample , we adopt the values given in verheijen & sancisi ( 2001 ) , while for the de jong sub  sample and most of the lsb galaxies from the bell et al . sub  sample ,  was extracted from the hyperleda information system .",
    "the integral fluxes in the 21cm line ( used to calculate the neutral gas mass component in galaxies ) were taken from hyperleda , verheijen & sancisi ( 2001 ) , and de blok et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "a condition imposed on our sample is that galaxies should be in a restricted range of inclinations ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "sample ) and with rotation curves that are still increasing at the last measured outer radius .",
    "only some lsb galaxies showed this feature .",
    "the final sample consists of 76 galaxies : 42 out of 86 , 29 out of 52 , and 5 ( 8) out of 23 from the de jong ( 1996a ) , verheijen ( 1997 ) , and bell et al .",

    "the local distances to the galaxies were calculated using the kinematic distance modulus given in hyperleda ( see more details in zahf ) .",
    "the value of the hubble constant used in this database is the same as that we assume here , @xmath23mpc@xmath24 . since the lsb galaxies from the bell et al .",

    "these features are mainly the morphological type , magnitude , disk central sb , integral color , and gas fraction .",
    "the total magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction ( following schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath4 term , and internal extinction ( see zahf for details ) . for the latter we used the empirical velocity ( luminosity ) dependent extinction coefficients determined by tully et al .",

    ", we followed verheijen ( 1997 ) , considering lsb galaxies optically thin in all bands .",
    "the hsb galaxies were also considered optically thin in the @xmath4 band .",
    "we have defined lsb galaxies as those with central sbs in the @xmath4 band , after sb correction , larger than 18.5 mag / arcsec@xmath26 ( verheijen 1997 ) . the 21 cm line  widths at the 20% level , , for the verheijen susbsample were taken directly from verheijen & sancisi ( 2001 ) .",
    "galaxies with  taken from leda were de  corrected ( for instrumental corrections ) to get the raw data ( paturel et al . 1997 ) , and then corrected again for broadening due to turbulent motions and for inclination , this time following the procedure by verheijen & sancisi ( 2001 ) .",
    "in zahf , we did not take into account the observational errors .",

    "the application of population synthesis techniques to disk galaxy evolution models shows that @xmath27 depends mainly on the integral color ( tinsley 1981 ; bruzual 1983 ; bell & de jong 2001 ) . in zahf",

    "they obtained a correlation of @xmath27 with @xmath28 color which is shallower and more scattered than that in bell & de jong ( 2001 ) .",
    "unfortunately , bell et al . (",
    "2003a ) did not report the correlation of @xmath27 with the @xmath5 color .",

    "it is also shown how the inferred values of @xmath27 , for low sbs , no longer decrease with decreasing sb , and even start to increase as sb decreases , although the scatter is large . in the absence of detailed models , we approximate the @xmath27-@xmath5 correlation for lsb galaxies in such a way that for @xmath30 , @xmath27 is given by eq .",

    "the stellar and baryonic masses of the galaxy calculated here are slightly different from those used in zahf .",
    "the scale length of the stellar disk , , is assumed to be equal to the scale length in the band @xmath4 , .",
    "most of the stars in the disk are properly traced using this band .",

    "mcgaugh & de blok ( 1997 ) estimated that m@xmath38m@xmath39 .",
    "for t@xmath40 , this empirical fitting formula could overestimate the gas mass in galaxies , thus we assume : m@xmath38m@xmath41 ( the value of the fit at @xmath42 ) for @xmath43 .",
    "the galaxy baryonic mass is defined as  =  + , and the gas mass fraction as  = /.",
    "unfortunately , we do not have information on the gas surface density profile parameters ( @xmath44 and h@xmath45 ) for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we need them in order to calculate the baryonic disk central surface densities , , and scale lengths , . as discussed in zahf , we assume that the total gas surface density follows an exponential distribution with a scale length 3 times that of .",
    "thus , @xmath46 . the baryonic quantity   is then calculated as  =  + @xmath47 . the corresponding baryonic radius will be then @xmath48^{0.5}$ ] .",
    "in fact , the addition of the ( uncertain ) gas disk parameters will have little impact on our final results .",
    "this inclusion is important only for gas rich galaxies ( late  type , blue lsb galaxies ) .",
    "we believe that in spite of the uncertainties , some real systematical variations of the baryonic disk scale length and surface density with the gas content of galaxies can still be taken into account through our procedure .    we have also estimated the errors in the composite quantities by adequately propagating the errors of the primary quantities .",
    "see appendix a for details .",
    "for the sample of 76 galaxies presented in  2 , we proceed to construct the physical scaling relations @xmath11-@xmath0 ( -@xmath6 ) , @xmath2-@xmath0 ( -@xmath6 ) , and @xmath11-@xmath2 in the bands @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and for stars and baryons .",
    "some authors recommend to use * @xmath49 * , the outer asymptotic flat part of the rotation curve , as an estimate of the circular velocity , instead of . we stress that for studies aiming to understand the origin of the tfr and its scatter ( the same applies for the @xmath11-@xmath2 relation ) as well as to compare them with galaxy model predictions , the adequate quantity to be used is  _ because it maximizes the contribution of the disk component for a given halo_. by using @xmath49 , which traces the dynamics of the galaxy in outer regions , where the halo component tends to dominate , we lose information about the disk contribution .",
    "in fact , here we use neither  nor @xmath49 , but .",
    "however , as mentioned in  2 , there is some evidence that @xmath50 .    for the luminosities and masses ,",
    "here we use the total ones , i.e. the sum of disk and bulge .",
    "for the cases when bulges form by disk secular evolution processes ( e.g. avila - reese & firmani 2000 ; avila - reese et al .",
    "2005 ) , this is a good approximation for total disk luminosities and masses . for the scale length , the corresponding @xmath3 and @xmath4 band radii are used in the luminous scaling relations . for the stellar and baryonic scaling relations we assume respectively",
    "=  and a scale length , , which takes into account the sum of the stellar and gas disks ( see  2.2 ) .    in figs .",
    "[ tf][vr ] , the observational points with the estimated error bars are plotted in the diagrams corresponding to the disk galaxy scaling relations studied here . the variables are given logarithmically .",
    "circles and triangles are used for galaxies with @xmath51 ( red ) and @xmath52 ( blue ) , respectively .",
    "the open and solid symbols are for galaxies with @xmath53 ( hsb ) and @xmath54 ( lsb ) , respectively .",
    "to quantify the correlations and compare them among the different pass  bands and mass quantities ( and eventually to model predictions ) , one needs to fit the correlations . to this end",
    ", a linear regression analysis should be used .",
    "we recall that our aim here is to explore variations for the scaling relations in the different cases ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands , stars , and baryons ) rather than study in detail the relations for each one of the cases .",
    "therefore , it is important for us _ to use the same regression method for all the cases rather than to choose an optimal method_.    for studies aimed at theoretical interpretations it is better to use a linear fit that is symmetric to interchanges of the two variables , e.g. the bisector or orthogonal regression linear methods .",
    "here we fit the correlations using the forward , backward , bisector , and orthogonal linear regression models .",
    "however , for further analysis and discussion , _ we will use only the orthogonal regression results_. the origin of coordinates for each correlation is shifted to the barycenter of the corresponding variables , where the slope and zero point are uncorrelated .",
    "the corresponding linear regressions , _ not taking into account _ the errors in the variables , were carried out for our galaxy sample in zavala ( 2003 ) by using the slopes routine ( isobe et al .",
    "1990 ; feigelson & babu 1992 ) .",
    "this seems to be a feasible approximation when the intrinsic scatter in the regression line dominates any errors arising from the measurement and error propagation procedures ( isobe et al .",
    "the tfr is the tightest one among the scaling relations .",
    "studies of the tfr have shown indeed that the intrinsic scatter of the linear fit is larger than the measurement and correction errors ( for both magnitude and velocity ) .",
    "for example , giovanelli et al . (",
    "1997 ) showed that the latter errors account for @xmath55 mag ( from smaller to larger velocities ) , while the total scatter to the fit is @xmath56 mag for the same range of velocities , implying that the _ intrinsic _ scatter dominates over the measurement and correction uncertainties . for the other scaling relations ,",
    "this difference is expected to be even larger .",
    "since we have obtained estimates of the errors in the variables of the scaling relations ( appendix a ) , here we carry out the corresponding `` error  in  variable '' regression models .",
    "thus , the analysis in the present paper is more exact than in zavala ( 2003 ) and it allows us to roughly estimate the values of the intrinsic scatter in the different scaling relationships . because the errors differ from point to point , the model should be heteroscedastic .",
    "we assume that the scaling relations have an ( unknown ) intrinsic scatter , which we want to estimate , explore , and confront with theory .",
    "the fitting regressions taking into account heteroscedastic measurement errors are carried out using the method and routine presented in akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) .",
    "the total average intrinsic scatter , , is estimated as the square root of the variance of the fit , @xmath57 , subtracted from the average ( in both variables ) observable variance , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 $ ] , where @xmath60 is the number of data points and @xmath61 is the slope of the correlation ) , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "more elaborate fitting procedures could be used to estimate the intrinsic scatter ( e.g. , gnedin et al .",
    "however , given the level of approximation we have used to determine the errors for the data , we consider that our first ",
    "order approximation is enough .",

    "conversely , steep dependences of   and/or @xmath99 upon mass would imply a significant change in the slope of the tfr .    regarding the intrinsic scatter , we have measured from the observational sample a value of = 0.051 for the baryonic tfr .",

    "based on these processes and by means of semi  numerical models , fa - r and avila - reese & firmani ( 2000 ) have shown that ( i ) lower surface density disks transform gas into stars with less efficiency than disks of high surface density , ( ii ) more massive disks tend to be of higher surface density ( see also dalcanton et al .",

    "galaxies that in the baryonic tfr were shifted to the high   side , because of their higher surface densities , transform gas into stars more efficiently and shift also to larger   values in the stellar tfr diagram compared to galaxies of lower surface densities . as a result , the dispersion in the stellar tfr due to disk surface density ( mainly associated to @xmath99 and ) decreases , and _ the tfr becomes almost the same for hsb and lsb galaxies : the anti  correlation between the residuals of the tfr and those of the -   relation disappears . _ the dispersion in the halo mah remains as the main source of scatter in the stellar tfr .",
    "however , regarding the original mah dispersion , it is also predicted that there is a kind of compensation in the shift of galaxies in the -@xmath6 diagrams : galaxies that were shifted to the high   side because they were formed in halos assembled earlier ( more concentrated ) , are also shifted to the larger   side because these galaxies had more time to consume their gas ( they end up with higher ) .",
    "the predictions of the based disk galaxy models provide an adequate context for interpreting the observational results plotted in the two upper rows of fig .",
    "[ residuos ] .",
    "the loss of dependence of the -@xmath6 correlation residuals upon the @xmath2-@xmath6 correlation residuals when changing from baryonic to stellar quantities can be understood on the ground of the ( self  regulated ) sf efficiency dependence on disk surface density described above ( see also dutton et al .",
    "this also explains the reduction of the scatter around the tfr from the baryonic case to the stellar case ( see table 1 ) , though the model results are more pronounced than observations both in the changes of the scatter values and in the slopes of the residual correlations .    in the same way , the distribution of galaxies in the diagrams of the residuals for the -@xmath6 , @xmath5-@xmath6 , and -@xmath6 correlations ( fig .",
    "[ residuos ] ) can be interpreted as follows . upon the understanding that disk color and   are related mainly to the halo mah ( concentration ) ,",
    "the correlations between the baryonic residuals @xmath109 and @xmath126 , and between @xmath109 and @xmath127 , are expected ( see above ) .",

[ residuos ] , one indeed sees these predicted tendencies , mainly for the hsb galaxies . for the lsb galaxies , the tendencies again ( see   3.4 ) almost disappear .",
    "it might be because the ( low ) sf rate in lsb galaxies no longer depend on the gas infall rate ; this dependence is what allowed us to associate the observables , color and , to the halo mah . in the residual plots corresponding to stellar quantities , the tendencies become negligible because from   to",
    ", the shifts in   in the tfr , due to the halo mah ( concentration ) , tend to be compensated by shifts in   ( see the previous paragraph ) .",

    "the only quantity that actually changes in the diagrams is @xmath65 for , through the @xmath14band mass  to  luminosity ratio , @xmath27 .",
    "this ratio increases slightly with the disk color for hsb galaxies and slightly decreases with it for blue lsb galaxies (  2.2 ) .",

    "furthermore , the residuals of the @xmath8band tfr are correlated with those of the @xmath5-@xmath66 correlation , and less with the residuals of the -@xmath66 and -@xmath66 correlations : redder galaxies , with higher sb and   tend to be shifted to the tfr large   side ; the opposite happens for bluer galaxies , with lower sb and   ( lowest row panels in fig .",
    "[ residuos ] ) .",
    "in fact , the step  wise backward analysis mentioned in   3.5 shows that the @xmath5 color is a statistically significant parameter in the -@xmath66-@xmath5 multi  variable correlation , i.e. _ color is the third parameter in the @xmath8 band tfr , _ a result that other authors have also found in the optical bands ( e.g. , verheijen & sancisi 2001 ; courteau et al .",
    "2007 ; kannappan et al .",
    "2002 , and more references therein ) .",
    "it is obvious that a galaxy in the -@xmath65 diagram shifts to the large ( low ) @xmath8band luminosity side if it is bluer ( redder ) than the corresponding average .    why do galaxies shifted to the high ( low )   side in the @xmath3 band tfr",

    "the galaxy models discussed above , disks formed in halos with low @xmath99 and/or early mass assembling ( high concentration ) , tend to consume gas into stars early in such a way that , for the same   or @xmath65 , they result with older stellar populations ( lower @xmath66 and redder ) and a higher   than those formed in halos with high @xmath99 and/or late mass assembling ( low concentration ) .",
    "thus , _ while the dispersions introduced by @xmath99 , , and the mah are reduced by compensating effects in the stellar and @xmath14band tfrs (   4.2 ) , the opposite happens in the @xmath8band tfr_. we see indeed that the tfr in blue bands is systematically more scattered than in the nir bands ( table 1 ) .    regarding the -@xmath66 correlation , its slope is significantly steeper than that of the -@xmath65 correlation .",
    "again this is because , as the galaxy is more luminous , it tends to be redder , i.e. , the @xmath66to@xmath65 ratio decreases with @xmath0 .",
    "however , the situation is more complex than in the tfr case , because in the @xmath2-@xmath0 diagrams ( i ) the scatter is large and galaxies are strongly segregated by sb and color , and ( ii ) the @xmath8 and @xmath14band radii are not the same as is the case of   in the tfr diagrams ; the to   ratio tends to be larger for redder , more luminous galaxies .",
    "thus , on one hand , the redder , higher sb galaxies shift to the low@xmath0 and high@xmath2 sides in the @xmath2-@xmath0 diagram when changing from band @xmath4 to band @xmath3 ; the shift tends to be larger for the more luminous galaxies ( see fig .",

    "this confirms that the most relevant shifts in the @xmath2-@xmath0 diagrams are due to @xmath0 rather than @xmath2 .",
    "the models predict that the scatter around the -@xmath2 relation should thicken slightly in the band @xmath3 with respect to the band @xmath4 : galaxies of lower sbs and/or bluer ( larger @xmath99 , late assembling halos , and lower ) , which are shifted to the low-   side in the @xmath4 band , tend to shift also to larger @xmath8band radii with respect to their   radii ; for galaxies that are of higher sb and redder , the radii tend to be the same in both bands .",
    "according to table 3 , the direct intrinsic scatter around the -   and -   correlations is almost the same , while the inverse scatter ( along the @xmath2 axis ) , is larger in the @xmath3 band .",

    "day mass later than the less massive ones . then disks formed inside the more massive halos would tend to be younger ( bluer ) than those formed in the less massive halos .",
    "however , the models also show that the more massive the halo is , the higher the surface density of the disk formed inside it ( dalcanton et al .",
    "1997 ; fa - r ) ; the higher the disk surface density , the more efficient the sf process and therefore , the redder the galaxy . as a result of these two evolutionary compensating effects ,",

    "2005 , see table 5 therein ) .",
    "a possible way to produce a steeper color@xmath6 correlation in the models is by obtaining a steeper disk surface density@xmath6 dependence ; in fact , the model prediction for this dependence is also too shallow as compared with observations ( see below ) .",
    "it should be said that the models do not include satellite galaxies and interacting  induced sf . for massive systems",
    "it is probable that the late gas infall is reduced by the large cooling time and because a fraction of the gas could have been trapped before into substructures that tend to be incorporated into the central galaxy through ( minor ) mergers ; all these processes make the most luminous galaxies redder and with larger   values than obtained in the fa - r models .",
    "an indirect dependence of galaxy color on @xmath0 may also appear through environment .",
    "however , the disk galaxy sample studied in this paper includes field galaxies and galaxies from the uma low ",

    "this correlation , which in some sense resembles the so  called _ anti  hierarchical or downsizing galaxy formation _ reported for early ",
    "type luminous galaxies ( e.g. , cimatti , daddi & renzini 2006 ) , could be produced by a mass ( luminosity)dependent dust extinction larger than that used here to correct the observations .",
    "another alternative is related to the agn feedback mechanism invoked recently to solve the sharp cut  off at the high  end of the ( elliptical ) galaxy luminosity function , as well as the observed downsizing of red early  type galaxies ( e.g. , bower et al .",

    "cervantes - sodi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested that the trend of @xmath99 with mass can be related to the halo angular momentum acquisition .",
    "a complementary explanation may lie in the baryon processes .",
    "for example , the outer gas in the most massive galaxy halos may not have enough time to cool and fall to the disk ( for numerical results see e.g. , van den bosch et al .",
    "2002 ; keres et al . 2005 ) ; the material located in the outer regions is the richest in the specific angular momentum ( bullock et al . 2001b ) .",
    "on the other hand , in less massive halos the outer gas may flow through filaments to the disk , even before being shock  heated by the halo collapse ( keres et al . 2005 ) . as a result",
    ", the specific angular moment content will be higher in low mass galaxies and lower in the massive ones , which implies lower and higher disk surface densities , respectively .",
    "note that this scenario also implies that more massive galaxies would tend to have lower values of .",

    "detailed model calculations are necessary for obtaining more quantitative conclusions .",
    "\\(3 ) _ are the scatters around the model and observed tfrs in agreement ?",
    "_ for the baryonic case , the agreement is marginal , given the scatter in the models is slightly larger than that in the observations (   4.1 )",
    ". the difference could be even larger if ( i ) some of the simplifying assumptions introduced in the models are relaxed , which would increase the predicted scatter , and/or ( ii ) systematical errors such as disk ellipticity are present , which would give rise to a reduction in our estimate of the observational intrinsic ( physical ) scatter .",
    "therefore , the current models of disk galaxy formation based on the   cosmology have a potential problem in predicting the intrinsic scatter around the baryonic tfr .",
    "this scatter is smaller in the models for lower values of   or for a distribution of @xmath99 narrower than that of the   halos .",
    "it could also be possible that the potential systematic errors , such as disk ellipticity , confabulate with the disk surface density or baryonic  to  total mass ratio ( with @xmath99 and   from the model s point of view ) in such a way that the observed tfr scatter is systematically diminished .",
    "for the stellar case , the scatter in the models becomes slightly smaller than that in the observations (   4.2 ) .",
    "although in both cases ( models and observations ) , the scatter decreases from the baryonic tfr to the stellar tfr , for models , the decrease is more pronounced than it is for observations .",
    "however , there are known effects not considered in the fa - r models , like the interaction  induced sf , that will work certainly in the direction of increasing the scatter around the stellar tfr ( e.g. , barton et al .",
    "2007 ) , but not around the baryonic one .",
    "\\(4 ) _ are current models able to match both the tfr zero  point and the galaxy luminosity function ?",
    "_ first , we note that the disk galaxy evolutionary approach , like the one of fa - r , is different by construction to the the semi  analytic models ( sam ) or the halo occupation models ( hom ) : the former is focused on the modeling of the galaxy internal physics and evolution , while the latter are constructed for reproducing galaxy population global properties as the luminosity function .",
    "the parameters that the sam and hom need for reproducing in detail the observed luminosity function apparently produce a luminous tfr whose zero  point is shifted to the higher  velocity side with respect to observations ( baugh 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "some astrophysical solutions were proposed to alleviate this apparent problem ( e.g. , dutton et al .",
    "2007 ; gnedin et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , before introducing modifications to the common disk galaxy formation scenario , we may mention at least four aspects that should be taken into account in order to compare fairly the predictions of sam / hom with observations in regards to the tfrs .",
    "( 1 ) since the tfrs are related to internal disk properties , a more detailed modeling of these properties than that carried out in the sam is necessary ; for example , in the sam , disks are assumed to have a purerely exponential mass distribution , the sf ",
    "feedback processes are artificially linked to the halo circular velocity , etc .",
    "( 2 )   is typically used to define the tfrs , while in the sam / hom only approximations to this velocity are calculated . ( 3 ) the tfrs refer only to the population of normal disk galaxies , while the luminosity function that the sam / hom fit to observations refers to the overall galaxy population .",
    "( 4 ) the halos where disk galaxies form could be a sub  group of the overall halo population , for example those that did not suffer a major merger since @xmath138 ; therefore , the corresponding `` disk galaxy '' halo mass function , and not the overall one , should be used in the hom as the starting point in the procedure of shaping the luminosity function .",
    "from the point of view of the sam and hom , the passage from the halo mass function to the galaxy luminosity function implies a specific to@xmath0 ratio as a function of mass .",
    "recent studies using galaxy ",
    "galaxy weak lensing , allowed one to directly determine the central galaxy to@xmath0 ratios ( e.g. , hoekstra et al . 2005 ; mandelbaum et al .",
    "for the fa - r models , which would agree very well with the baryonic and stellar tfrs if corrected for @xmath133 , we have the @xmath8band luminosities available . the results from mandelbaum et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for _ late  type _ galaxies ( note that they differ from those of the early  type galaxies ) are given in the @xmath139 band . by using @xmath140 for late  type galaxies ( de jong 1996b ) and @xmath141",

    ", the values just reported should be increased by @xmath149 due to the different definitions of .",
    "the good agreement between the models and observations within their scatters is encouraging .",
    "the model predictions also agree roughly with the @xmath142 and @xmath150 ratios calculated from the observed luminosity function and the stellar mass  to@xmath0 ratios inferred from kinematical mass modelling ( shankar et al .",
    "we can also compare tracers of the inner luminous ( or baryonic)to  dark matter ratios of models and observed galaxies .",
    "for example , in zahf the disk  to  total velocity ratio at the maximum of the rotation curve was estimated for the same galaxies studied here . the models and observations",
    "were found to agree roughly , both in the zero point as well as in the dependence of this ratio on the disk surface density or sb ( see fig . 3 in zahf ) .",
    "summarizing , the fa - r models based on the   scenario seem to be able to predict both the tfr , including its zero point , and the inferred , directly from observations , to  luminosity ratios of central late  type galaxies , as well as the inner luminous and baryonic  to  dark matter contents .",
    "these ratios , specially the former , are closely related to the `` transfer '' function needed for passing from the halo mass function to the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "we speculate that if the sam and hom take into account the shortcomings mentioned above , then the potential problem of fitting both the tfr zero point and the luminosity function will be overcome . on the other hand ,",
    "some of the initial condition parameters used in models such as those of fa - r , if any , could be modified accordingly to reproduce the disk ",
    "galaxy luminosity function , while the tfrs ( and the other scaling relations ) would be yet in agreement with the observations .",
    "for example , the anti  correlation of   with mass for luminous galaxies ( motivated by the large cooling time in massive halos ) that the sam / hom evoke , could be allowed by the models as discussed in items 1 and 2 above .",
    "a compiled sample of 76 normal ( non  interacting ) local disk galaxies of all morphological types and sbs has been used to construct and compare , among them , the luminous ( bands @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , stellar and baryonic scaling relations . the required observational information for building up this sample implied detailed surface photometry in bands @xmath3 and @xmath4 , a dynamical determination of the rotation curve amplitude , and hi gas integrated flux data .",
    "we have corrected and processed the observational data homogeneously , and obtained several composite disk quantities and their uncertainties : global @xmath5 colors , stellar masses and surface densities , gas ( or stellar ) fractions , and baryonic masses , surface densities and scale lengths .",
    "the objectives of this work were ( i ) to explore the changes of the disk ",
    "galaxy scaling relations and their residuals as moving from optical to nir bands , and to stellar and baryonic quantities , ( ii ) to look for interpretations of the results in the context of based evolutionary disk  galaxy models , and ( iii ) to show the necessity of larger samples , similar to the one compiled here , for constraining models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "a summary of the results is as follows .    ",
    "the slope of the baryonic tfr is shallower than the slopes of the stellar and @xmath14band tfrs ( @xmath151 vs @xmath152 and 0.26 ; orthogonal regression ) and , in agreement with previous works , the slope of the @xmath8band tfr is steeper than that of the @xmath14band tfr ( @xmath74 vs @xmath152 ) .",
    "the estimated average intrinsic scatters in log   around the baryonic , stellar , @xmath14 and @xmath8band tfrs are 0.051 , 0.045 , 0.049 , and 0.063 dex , respectively .",
    "thus , the baryonic tfr is more scattered than the stellar tfr .",
    "a statistical analysis shows that the radius ( or surface density ) is a significant third parameter in the former relation , while the latter , as well as the @xmath14band tfr , do not admit a third parameter . in the case of the @xmath8band tfr , which is the most scattered",
    ", the @xmath5 color is a significant third parameter .    ",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath153 correlations are scattered and segregated strongly by disk sb and weakly by color .",
    "the slopes of the baryon , stellar , and @xmath14band correlations are around 0.30 ( orthogonal regression ) , while for the @xmath8band relation , this increases to 0.44 . the scatter around the latter , projected in the luminosity axis , is smaller than that in the other correlations .",
    "the @xmath154 correlations are the most scattered and are also segregated strongly by disk sb and less by color .",
    "the slopes have values of around 0.5 .    ",
    "the residuals of the baryonic -   and -   correlations are anti - correlated , mainly for the hsb galaxies .",
    "the slope is @xmath87 ( orthogonal regression ) , showing that the smaller the disk radius , for a given mass ( higher surface density ) , the larger the disk contribution to .",
    "for the stellar and @xmath14band cases , the anti  correlation almost disappears .",
    "thus , our results show that the correlations among the mentioned residuals are different for the baryonic , stellar , @xmath14 and @xmath8band cases .",
    "while the correlation ( or the lack of it ) among the residuals in the baryonic case can be used to explore the dynamical importance of the halo / disk in galaxies , in the stellar and luminous cases the effects related to sf processes distort any pure dynamical interpretation of the results .     in spite of the velocity  dependent internal extinction correction that we have applied , the @xmath5 color correlates significantly with the logarithms of @xmath66 , @xmath65 , , and   ( orthogonal regression slopes of 0.61 , 0.53 , 0.56 , and 0.60 , respectively ) .",
    "noisy but steep correlations are observed between the surface densities and brightnesses and the corresponding masses and luminosities . the stellar fraction , , correlates strongly with @xmath5 and less with surface densities ( brightnesses ) and luminosities ( masses ) . in all cases ,",
    "the lowest sb galaxies break the latter correlations , suggesting a kind of threshold in the surface density , below which the sf rate is almost independent of it ( and of @xmath6 or @xmath0 ) and of the gas infall rate .",
    "we have discussed previous models of disk  galaxy formation and evolution ( including halo contraction , sf , and disk feedback ; e.g. , fa - r ) within hierarchically growing   halos , under the assumption of gas  detailed angular momentum conservation .",
    "we showed the potentiality of these models to describe the observational inferences , as well as how such inferences can help us to constrain several of the model parameters .",
    "a crucial aspect of this endeavor is the correct comparison of models with observations .",
    "the basic models refer to isolated normal disk galaxies .",
    "therefore , the observational sample should also be for nearly isolated normal disk galaxies .",
    "we highlight the following conclusions :    @xmath155 the slopes of the baryonic - , - , and -   correlations can be interpreted as a direct imprint of the cosmological   halo - , - , and -   relations , especially the former ( baryonic tfr ) , which is the tightest one .",
    "the models show that this relation is robust to systematical or statistical variations in the disk baryonic mass fraction , , for @xmath156 .",
    "then , the main sources of scatter are the dispersions in the halo spin parameter @xmath99 and halo mah ( or concentration ) .",
    "the fa - r models provide a lower limit to the scatter around the relation due to these two dispersions , namely @xmath157 ( = 0.05=const . ) , which is already slightly larger than our observational inference .    @xmath155 in combination , the slopes and scatters of the baryonic - , - , and -   correlations inferred here from observations , as well as the correlations among their residuals , imply that the average value of   in normal disk galaxies could not be larger than @xmath158 and that   can not depend strongly on @xmath6 ( or @xmath0 ) ; if any , a moderate anti ",

    "disks with high @xmath99 values are of low surface density and have a negligible gravitational contribution to ; then , the dependence of   on   ( or on   for a fixed mass ) tends to disappear .",
    "the models can also explain why the anti  correlation among the residuals becomes negligible in the stellar or @xmath14band cases : for a given mass , galaxies not only shift to the high-   side in the tfr diagram as the radius is smaller (   is higher ) , but also shift to the high-   ( or @xmath65 ) side due to a higher efficiency in transforming gas into stars . as a result ,",
    "the scatter around the stellar tfr becomes independent of   or , and smaller than in the baryonic case .",
    "@xmath155 the ( self  regulated ) sf efficiency effect just mentioned produces a dependence of the stellar mass fraction   on surface density ( or brightness ) .",
    "such a non  trivial prediction roughly agrees with the one found for our processed galaxy catalog ( fig . [ stfrac ] ) , and it is associated mainly with the @xmath99 parameter : the smaller the @xmath99 , the higher the disk surface density and the more efficient the transformation of gas into stars . although less relevant ,   and   are also affected by the gas infall history , which is connected to the cosmological halo mah . since the mah plays a role in the scatter of the baryonic tfr , trends among the residuals of this relation and those of the color-   and -   relations are predicted .",
    "these trends were found for our observational catalog , mainly for the hsb galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ residuos ] ) . for lsb galaxies",
    ", it could be that the sf  rate timescale becomes larger than the that of the gas infall rate , the connection between mah and color/   then disappears .",
    "@xmath155 _ potential difficulties.- _ our observational results show that both ( i ) the color@xmath6 and ( ii ) surface density@xmath6 correlations are steeper than the models would predict .",
    "we speculate that these shortcomings suggest that late minor mergers and interaction  induced sf , which are more common in massive galaxies , should play some role and/or that both , the galaxy spin parameter and   anti  correlate with mass ; at least qualitatively , both anti  correlations , in combination are not expected to affect the scaling correlations presented here .",
    "( iii ) the fact that the intrinsic scatter around the predicted baryonic tfr appears to be larger than that inferred here , implies that there is no room for other physical or systematical sources of scatter around the tfr such as disk ellipticity . on the other hand , the intrinsic scatter around the stellar tfr becomes smaller in the models than in the observations .",
    "however , external effects , such as the interaction  driven sf , work in the direction of adding some scatter to the stellar tfr .",
    "( iv ) the fa - r models ( rescaled to @xmath133 ) agree with the observed baryonic and stellar tfr zero points as well as with the to@xmath0 ratios inferred directly from observations .",
    "the potential difficulty that the sam / hom find in matching both the tfr zero point and the luminosity function could be solved by taking into account the shortcomings we have discussed in  5 .",

    "<S> some of our findings are : ( i ) the scale length   is a third parameter in the baryonic tully  fisher relation ( tfr ) and the residuals of this relation follow a trend ( slope @xmath7 ) with the residuals of the -   relation ; for the stellar and @xmath4 band cases , the scale length is not anymore a third parameter and the mentioned trend disappears ; ( ii ) among the tfrs , the @xmath8band tfr is the most scattered ; in this case , the color is a third parameter , in agreement with previous works ; ( iii ) the low sb galaxies break some observed trends in diagrams that include surface density , color , and , suggesting then a threshold in the gas surface density @xmath9 , below which the sf becomes independent of the gas infall rate and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are interpreted and discussed in the light of @xmath10 cold dark matter  based models of disk  galaxy formation and evolution . </S>",
    "<S> these models are able to explain not only the baryonic scaling correlations , but also most of the processes responsible for the observed changes in the slopes , scatters , and correlations among the residuals when changing to stellar and luminous quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy baryon fraction , , is required to be smaller than 0.05 on average . </S>",
    "<S> we detect some potential difficulties for the models : the observed color-@xmath6 and surface density-@xmath6 correlations are steeper , and the intrinsic scatter in the baryonic tfr is smaller than those predicted . </S>"
