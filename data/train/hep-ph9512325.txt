    "<S> we point out that high - mass thresholds in the evolution of the strong - interaction coupling parameter @xmath0 , due to gluinos , squarks and possible new heavy quarks , could introduce appreciable corrections to the transverse momentum dependence of jet production at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> if the new thresholds were near scale @xmath1  gev , then within the limits of asymptotic freedom they could introduce up to @xmath2 increase in @xmath3 ( and hence @xmath4 increase in jet production ) at scale @xmath5 gev , compared to standard model extrapolations .    6.25 in 9.75 in = =    # 1#20=1=to0@xmath60=1=to0#2#1 - 01    = cmssbx10 scaled 2 to    * thresholds in @xmath0 evolution and the @xmath7 dependence of jets * + v. barger@xmath8 , m.s . </S>",

    "<S> the cdf experiment at the fermilab tevatron collider has recently reported that inclusive jet production in @xmath11 collisions appears to exceed next - to - leading order qcd expectations in the transverse momentum range @xmath12 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that the discrepancy might be explained by a modified gluon distribution in the nucleon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is also possible that some new physics may be playing a significant role . in the present note </S>",
    "<S> we point out that high - mass thresholds due to gluinos @xmath13 and squarks @xmath14 , plus possible new non - standard quarks @xmath15 and squarks @xmath16 , would change the evolution of the qcd coupling parameter @xmath3 at large values of the scale @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> . this effect could give a significant enhancement above standard expectations , both for @xmath3 at large @xmath18 and hence also for the jet production cross section at large @xmath7 .    the evolution equation for @xmath3 at one loop </S>",
    "<S> can be written @xmath19^{-1 } = { b_3 \\over 2\\pi},\\ ] ] with @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the number of quark flavors that are active , i.e. that have @xmath23 @xcite . in a supersymmetric ( susy ) </S>",
    "<S> model , @xmath24 reduces by two units above the gluino threshold and by @xmath25 above each successive squark threshold ( assuming degenerate l- and r - chiral squarks ) , giving @xmath26 where we assume the gluino is active and @xmath27 denotes the number of active squark flavors . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that as the scale @xmath18 increases , successively more thresholds are crossed and the rate of evolution of @xmath28^{-1}$ ] decreases . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the rate of fall of @xmath3 as @xmath18 increases ( asymptotic freedom ) is reduced with each successive threshold . </S>",
    "<S> further new physics , for example new iso - singlet quarks @xmath29 and their susy partners @xmath30 ( that appear naturally in the [ 27]-plet of @xmath31 symmetry @xcite ) would reduce @xmath24 even more @xcite ; each counts the same as a conventional quark or squark in eq.([eq : b3gen ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , a fourth generation would add two quark plus two squark flavors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> with three new quarks plus squarks the value @xmath32 is reached and we can go no further without breaking asymptotic freedom ( af ) . although af is not an inviolable principle , it is an attractive feature ; we therefore limit our present illustrations to cases up to the af limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve in fig.1 shows the one - loop evolution of @xmath3 versus @xmath18 for the standard model ( sm ) colored - particle content . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted curve shows the change to the minimum supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) , assuming for simplicity a common squark / gluino threshold at @xmath33 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the dot - dashed curve shows the effect of adding three singlet quarks with the same threshold ; the case of one or two singlet quarks can be obtained by interpolation between dotted and dot - dashed curves . </S>",
    "<S> finally the horizontal dashed curve shows that adding three singlet squarks too , with the same threshold , brings us to the af limit . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed curve lies above the solid sm curve by a factor 1.11 at scale @xmath5 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive jet production cross section @xmath34 at the tevatron is based on @xmath35 qcd parton subprocesses that are proportional to @xmath28 ^ 2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> a common choice for the scale @xmath18 here is @xmath36 , in terms of the jet transverse momentum @xmath7 ; in this case the new threshold effects of fig.1 would only be felt for @xmath37 gev , i.e.mostly beyond the range of the reported tevatron data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the choice @xmath38 instead , the effects of fig.1 would give an enhancement for @xmath39 gev ; at @xmath40 gev this enhancement ranges between @xmath41 ( for the mssm case ) and @xmath4 ( for the af limit case ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath7 could be determined in principle by higher - order calculations of jet production , including the physics beyond the standard model in the loops , but for the present it remains an open question .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that new thresholds in the evolution of @xmath0 are capable of providing substantial increases in the jet hadroproduction cross section at large @xmath42 , and may be significant contributors to the reported effect . </S>"
