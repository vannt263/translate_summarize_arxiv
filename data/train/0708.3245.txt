    "waves at surfaces and interfaces are known to exhibit peculiar properties .",
    "localized electronic states at a crystal edge , discovered by tamm  @xcite , were the first example of such phenomena . later on it",
    "was found , that surfaces and interfaces are able to sustain localized waves which attracted a great deal of attention in different areas of physics , particularly due to variety of practical applications , like plasmonic waveguides  @xcite , sensors  @xcite , etc .",
    "recently it was predicted theoretically  @xcite and observed experimentally  @xcite , that at the edge of a semi - infinite one - dimensional ( 1d ) array of nonlinear waveguides there can exist discrete surface solitons .",
    "modes localized at finite distances from the edge were considered in  @xcite and surface gap solitons between uniform media and periodic lattice were reported in  @xcite .",
    "different type of surface modes in 2d arrays were studied in @xcite .",
    "structures with two surfaces give rise to novel properties of surface modes .",
    "for example , interaction of the two surface polaritons , supported by each surface of a metallic film , results in creation of symmetric and antisymmetric modes  @xcite , which in their turn originate polariton - assisted extraordinary transmittancy of the film  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe discrete ( _ edge _ and _ corner _ ) surface modes in finite 1d and 2d arrays of nonlinear waveguides .",
    "we show that they can be classified on the basis of the anti - continuum ( ac ) limit , similarly to the classification of intrinsic localized modes introduced in  @xcite , and in this way the _ complete _ families of modes can be identified .",
    "we show that surface modes can bifurcate either with other surface or with bulk modes and study the mode stability .",
    "we also report a new type of the surface excitations  _ surface breathers _  which represent two - frequency excitations localized in the vicinity of the array edges .",
    "we start with a finite array of @xmath0 nonlinear waveguides described by the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation  @xcite @xmath1 here @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the propagation coordinate , @xmath4 is the dimensionless field amplitude in the @xmath5-th waveguide ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for focusing and defocusing nonlinearities .",
    "we concentrate on modes having definite parity imposing @xmath9 for symmetric and @xmath10 for antisymmetric modes .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) possess two integrals of motion : the hamiltonian @xmath11 and the total power @xmath12 .",
    "it worth to emphasize that the dnls equation ( [ eq : mm ] ) is a widely used model in the condensed matter physics  @xcite and in the theory of bose - einstein condensates loaded in optical lattices  @xcite , what makes the results reported below to be relevant for a rather wide class of the phenomena of the nonlinear physics of periodic and discrete structures .",
    "like in the well studied infinite case  @xcite , stationary modes of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) are searched in the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the propagation constant , and the resulting equations are @xmath15 the solutions for @xmath16 are connected by the following symmetry reduction  @xcite : if the @xmath17 is a solution of ( [ eq : mm ] ) for a definite @xmath14 and @xmath18 , then @xmath19 is a solution for @xmath20 and @xmath8 .    in order to describe the whole diversity of solutions and to classify them  @xcite",
    ", one has to consider the ac limit  @xcite .",
    "to this end we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) in terms of the rescaled stationary amplitudes @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and consider the limit @xmath24 . in this limit @xmath25",
    "become independent and for the case @xmath26 acquire one of the three values : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "thus , in the ac limit there exists @xmath31}-1\\right)/2 $ ] symmetric and @xmath32}-1\\right)/2 $ ] antisymmetric modes ( here square brackets signify the integer part ) , and each mode can be coded  @xcite by a sequence of @xmath0 symbols @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the coding corresponds to the limit of the infinite power : i.e. , in particular , `` 0 '' does not refer to the zero intensity of a waveguide at a finite input intensity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fs ] , and discussion below ) . as an example ,",
    "an array of three waveguides has four symmetric : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 modes , and one antisymmetric mode @xmath40 .",
    "a sequence , consisting of symbols @xmath41 , is termed a `` _ word _ '' , a word having only zeros is referred to as _ `` empty '' _ , and a word having no @xmath34 ( for example @xmath38 ) is called a _ `` simple '' _ word .",
    "number of symbols in a word is called the _ length of the word_.    the first important property of the coding steams from the analytical continuation of the ac limit  @xcite to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a constant ( in the case of the infinite array @xmath44",
    "this means that _ all the words exhaust all possible modes of a finite array _ existing for @xmath45 .",
    "second , ac limit allows one to introduce a definition for a _ surface mode _ as a _ code consisting of two simple words separated by an empty word , the latter having the length not less than the lengths of each of the simple words_. for example @xmath46 is a surface mode of an array of @xmath47 waveguides .",
    "all other modes will be referred to as _",
    "bulk modes_. the introduced terminology , being mathematically well defined , has relative physical meaning for finite @xmath14 : surface modes can bifurcate with bulk modes , the both acquiring identical shapes in the bifurcation point .      in the linear limit @xmath48 ( or formally @xmath49 ) the eq.([eq : mms ] ) possesses @xmath0 eigenvalues @xmath50}$ ] corresponding to eigenmodes @xmath51     _ vs _ the propagation constant @xmath14 for the bulk symmetric and antisymmetric modes in the case @xmath7 , @xmath52 , which do not have the excitation threshold : 1  mode @xmath53 , 2  mode @xmath54 , 3 ",
    "mode @xmath55 , 4  mode @xmath56 , 5  mode @xmath57 , 6  mode @xmath58 .",
    "the bifurcation points with asymmetric modes are depicted by filled circles . ]",
    "thus one can expect that @xmath0 bulk modes have linear limit and thus do not possess an intensity threshold of excitation : for these modes , when @xmath59 , the power @xmath60 of @xmath61-th mode ( @xmath62 ) approaches zero ( see fig.[fig : bulk ] ) . in order to determine the dependence @xmath63 near the linear limit we follow the standard perturbation technique ( see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) , and look for a solution of ( [ eq : mms ] ) in a form of the series @xmath64 where we have introduced the small parameter @xmath65 . substituting the above expansions into eq.([eq : mms ] ) and gathering the terms of the same order in @xmath66 , we rewrite eq.([eq : mms ] ) in the form of a set of equations : @xmath67 here @xmath68 , @xmath69 . as it is clear eq.([eq : mul - scale ] ) for @xmath70 describes a linear eigenmode and therefore is automatically satisfied , while considering solvability conditions for @xmath71 ( it is equivalent to orthogonality @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we obtain the corrections to the eigenvalues written in the form @xmath74    it follows from eq.([eq : small - ampl ] ) that each of @xmath0 linear modes possesses its unique small - amplitude nonlinear analogue ( from all diversity of nonlinear modes only given @xmath0 bulk modes have small - amplitude solution ) .",
    "this also proves that _ no linear surface mode exists _",
    "( what corroborates with the earlier findings for a semi - infinite array  @xcite ) . moreover , from eq.([eq : small - ampl ] ) it follows , that in the small - amplitude limit these modes are characterized by the linear dependence of the mode total power upon the propagation constant : @xmath75 from eq.([eq : linlim ] ) it is clear , that powers of these modes are decaying for @xmath7 and increasing for @xmath8 functions of @xmath14 . to single out the obtained modes in what follows they",
    "are referred to as _ quasi - linear _ modes .",
    "when the power increases one of two scenario of mode transformations is possible : either the branch of the quasi - linear mode smoothly tends to a uniquely defined ac limit or at some @xmath76 ( alternatively @xmath77 ) it bifurcates giving origin to some new solutions . as it is clear , each mode can bifurcate either with a mode of the same symmetry or with an asymmetric mode ( which in principle does not possess any symmetry , but in the bifurcation point acquires the given symmetry ) .",
    "if the former even takes place then the quasi - linear mode is naturally classified by its ac limit . while analytical description of other cases we leave for further studies , we mention that all numerical simulations we performed with a finite number of waveguides have shown that no bifurcations of the quasi - linear modes with modes of the same symmetry occurs : only asymmetric modes bifurcate from the quasi - linear ones .",
    "this allows us to use for the latter modes the classification determined by their symmetric ac limit ( i.e. by a word describing symmetric ramification of the mode ) .",
    "namely this notations are used in the figure captions and in the text whenever we speak about quasi - linear modes .    to determine numerically the bifurcation points of the quasi - linear modes we consider the continuation of the mode by the parameter @xmath14 ( notice that contrary the standard approach  @xcite now we `` move '' along the branch outwards the linear limit ) @xmath78^{-1}\\frac{\\partial{\\textbf{f}}(\\textbf{q},\\lambda)}{\\partial\\lambda},\\ ] ] where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and the entries of the three - diagonal matrix @xmath81 are @xmath82 this continuation of the quasi - linear modes is possible , while the matrix @xmath81 is invertible , i.e. its determinant is not equal to zero .",
    "thus the bifurcation point is determined by the equation @xmath83 .",
    "as we already mentioned @xmath0 quasi - linear modes can bifurcate with asymmetric modes what is illustrated in fig.[fig : bulk ] obtained for @xmath52 . there",
    "all symmetric modes possess additional bifurcation points , denoted by filled circles .",
    "although the consideration of modes without symmetry is beyond the scope of this paper , we now analyze analytically the simplest case of @xmath84 and @xmath7 allowing the trivial solution . in that case there",
    "exists one antisymmetric mode @xmath85 ( with code @xmath86 ) and one symmetric mode @xmath87 ( with code @xmath88 ) . substituting the expressions for the field distribution of the antisymmetric mode @xmath86 into ( [ eq : det ] ) , we obtain , that @xmath89 only when @xmath90 ( where the mode is born ) . for the symmetric mode @xmath88 one verifies that similar to the previous case @xmath89 at the point of linear limit @xmath91 , but also at @xmath92 , where the mode @xmath88 bifurcates with mode @xmath93 .",
    "the mode @xmath93 ( for which @xmath94 ) exists only when @xmath95 , and at the point @xmath76 its has the same field distribution as mode @xmath88 ( so , we have a pitchfork - type bifurcation ) .     _ vs _",
    "@xmath14 for fundamental ( a ) , ( d ) , and twisted ( g ) modes . in panels",
    "b , c , e , f examples of the symmetric ( a , b , e , f ) and antisymmetric ( c , d , g , h ) fundamental surface modes , as well as their classifications , are shown for @xmath96 ( panels b , c ) and @xmath52 ( panels e , f ) . in panels h , i symmetric ( a , b ) and antisymmetric ( c , d ) twisted surface modes for @xmath96 are shown . in all examples @xmath7 .",
    "for comparison , in panels a , d , and g the dashed lines represent doubled powers of the same modes in a semi - infinite waveguide array . ]      turning now to the analysis of surface modes , by analogy with an infinite array  @xcite , one can distinguish _ fundamental _ modes having in - phase distribution of the field near the edges and _ twisted _ surface modes , having out - of - phase fields in the two waveguides bordering an edge .",
    "as an examples , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] we show the mode patterns for arrays of @xmath52 and @xmath96 waveguides .",
    "all the modes shown require a threshold power to be excited .",
    "two different symmetric and antisymmetric fundamental surface modes bifurcate with each other at @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( the codes of such modes are indicated in the respective panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] ) .",
    "the pairs of symmetric modes , ( a , b ) and ( e , f ) , bifurcate in @xmath99 and @xmath100 , while the bifurcation points of antisymmetric modes ( c , d ) and ( g , h ) , are given by @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we observe that @xmath103 and thus the antisymmetric modes are excited at lower field intensities .",
    "comparing the bifurcation points of the modes with different @xmath0 we also observe that for large enough arrays , i.e. at @xmath104 , the modes are transformed in the conventional surface modes of a semi - infinite array . in this limit distinction between symmetric and antisymmetric modes disappears .",
    "thus , presence of two boundaries of a finite array essentially modifies a surface mode .",
    "the physical reason for this that in a vicinity of the bifurcation point the modes are weakly localized near the array edges , and the field in waveguides near the center of the array is non negligible ( see fig.[fig : fs ] ) .",
    "this leads to interaction between the modes , supported by the two edges , what in its turn modifies the patterns . at large values of @xmath105 the modes are strongly localized near the edges and interaction between them is weak ,",
    "what results in the identical asymptotic behavior of symmetric and antisymmetric modes in the ac limit clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] a , d .",
    "the code of the twisted mode includes more nonzero symbols in comparison with the code of the fundamental mode .",
    "so , since symbol `` 0 '' in the code of certain mode signifies zero field amplitude in the correspondent waveguide in the ac limit , the power of twisted mode in ac limit should be higher than the power of fundamental mode .",
    "nevertheless as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] g , even in the vicinity of the bifurcation point twisted modes are excited at higher intensities than the fundamental modes . also due to higher field in the center of the waveguide array ( in comparison with the fundamental mode case ) the interaction between two edges of the array is stronger , what is expressed by the relation @xmath106 ( the bifurcation points are @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) .",
    "the main peculiarity of the diagram of the twisted modes is that surface modes a and c bifurcate with the bulk modes b and d.    to study linear stability of the modes , we follow the standard steps analyzing the eigenvalue problem linearized about the mode , where @xmath109 is the spectral parameter such that @xmath110 corresponds to a linearly unstable mode",
    ". the imaginary parts of @xmath109 for the fundamental modes b , d , f , and h decrease with @xmath111 , i.e. the modes are unconditionally unstable ( similar behavior was reported in  @xcite ) .",
    "symmetric fundamental modes a and e are unstable , but @xmath112 increase with the decreasing of @xmath14 .",
    "the antisymmetric fundamental modes c and g are unstable in the vicinity of the bifurcation point , but are stabilized at @xmath113 ( for @xmath96 ) and @xmath114 ( for @xmath52 ) .",
    "stability analysis of the twisted modes shows , that symmetric modes a , b , and the antisymmetric mode d are unconditionally linearly unstable , while the antisymmetric mode c is stable at @xmath115 ( these results corroborate with the results of @xcite for the discrete modes of infinite array ) .",
    "now we consider a novel type of localized modes  surface breathers .",
    "antisymmetric surface breathers can be constructed analytically for an array of @xmath116 sites . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) possesses a solution of the following type ( found using the known dynamics of a dimer  @xcite ) @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are jacobi elliptic functions , @xmath120 is the intensity contrast , @xmath121 is the elliptic modulus , @xmath122 @xmath123 is the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "when @xmath126 , the function @xmath127,\\ ] ] describes a mode concentrated near the edges @xmath128 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : breath ] ) and oscillating with the period @xmath129 ( @xmath130 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind ) . in the limit",
    "@xmath131 ( taken at a constant power @xmath132 ) the hamiltonian achieves it minimal value @xmath133 and the intensity contrast becomes a constant . in that case",
    "the surface breather transforms into a fundamental surface mode ( e.g. the breathers in fig .",
    "[ fig : breath ] a and b transform into the surface modes with @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , respectively ) .",
    "thus , a surface breather can be excited from the fundamental surface mode by small detuning of its hamiltonian from the minimum .",
    "we used this idea to construct the antisymmetric surface breathers for arrays of @xmath96 and @xmath140 waveguides ( fig .  [",
    "fig : breath ] c and d ) , which can not be constructed analytically .",
    "notice that when the hamiltonian possesses its minimal value , the surface breathers of fig .",
    "[ fig : breath ] c , d transform into stationary modes with @xmath96 , @xmath138 , @xmath141 and @xmath140 , @xmath138 , @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "we tested the stability of breathers by direct numerical solution of differential eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) , perturbing the initial profiles by noise with an amplitude of order of 10% of @xmath17 in each waveguide .",

    "the case @xmath149 also allows for analytical construction of symmetric ( @xmath150 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath151 ) breathers .",
    "now @xmath152 $ ] , where @xmath153 is a root of the polynomial @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 is the weierstrass elliptic function with @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "the character of oscillations of the field along the waveguides is determined by @xmath162 : for @xmath163 the solutions are oscillatory about a nonzero average , but for @xmath164 the solutions are aperiodic .",
    "now we discuss surface modes of a 2d finite @xmath165 array , where each waveguide is coupled with the nearest neighbors .",
    "the system is described by coupled 2d dnls equation @xmath166 now the total power is given by @xmath167 and the symmetry reductions of the stationary modes @xmath168 are as follows : if the @xmath169 is a solution of ( [ eq : nm ] ) for a definite @xmath14 and @xmath18 , then @xmath170 is a solution for @xmath20 and @xmath8 .",
    "similar to the 1d case , each mode can be coded on a 2d _ map _ by an array of @xmath165 symbols @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ( see examples in fig .  [",
    "fig : def - cor - edge ] ) , corresponding to its ac limit ( @xmath171 ) . splitting the array into blocks , we call _ `` empty '' _ a block consisting of all zeros and `` _ simple _ '' a simply - connected block having no zeros .",
    "now we define a _ corner _ mode as a mode on a square array consisting of only simple blocks at the corners , separated by empty blocks of higher dimensions ( see an example in fig.[fig : def - cor - edge]a ) .",
    "being interested only in modes of a definite symmetry we impose additional constrains : @xmath172 ( for fully symmetric modes ) , @xmath173 ( for symmetric - antisymmetric modes ) and @xmath174 ( for fully antisymmetric modes ) .",
    "similarly we identify an _ edge _ mode , whose code consists of simple blocks bordering edges of the array , but separated from each other and from the corners by empty blocks ( see the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : def - cor - edge]b ) .",
    "a symmetry constrains for the edge mode are as follows : @xmath175 ( for fully symmetric modes ) , @xmath176 ( for symmetric - antisymmetric modes ) and @xmath177 ( for fully antisymmetric modes ) .",
    "we restrict the consideration to the lowest - power fundamental modes , i.e. modes coded by one - site simple blocks .",
    "we found that similar to the 1d case both corner and edge fully antisymmetric modes ( c and f in fig .",
    "[ fig : cor - edge ] , correspondingly ) require lower threshold power of excitations that other types of the modes , while the fully symmetric modes ( a and d in fig .  [ fig : cor - edge ] , correspondingly ) are excited at higher powers ( see upper panel in fig.[fig : cor - edge ] ) .",
    "at the same time the distinction between the properties of the fully symmetric , semi - symmetric and fully antisymmetric edge modes is stronger than the distinction between the properties of similar types of corner modes .",
    "this occurs due to the smaller distance ( and , hence , stronger interaction ) between the excitation centered at four edges in comparison with excitations centered at four corners ( compare , e.g. field patterns for modes a and d , b and e , c and f in fig.[fig : cor - edge ] ) .",
    "the stability analysis shows that fully symmetric and symmetric - antisymmetric modes a , b , d , e are unstable , but their instability increments @xmath110 increase as @xmath14 decreases .",
    "the fully antisymmetric modes c and f are stabilized at @xmath178 and @xmath179 , respectively .",
    "_ vs _ the propagation constant @xmath14 ( upper panel ) for corner ( solid lines ) and edge ( dashed lines ) modes .",
    "examples of the patterns of the corner ( panels a - c ) and edge ( panels d - f ) modes are shown for @xmath96 and @xmath7 .",
    "a and d are fully symmetric modes , b and e are symmetric - antisymmetric modes , and c and f are fully antisymmetric modes . ]",
    "we have reported the complete families of ( edge and corner ) surface modes in arrays of 1d and 2d waveguides , presenting the classification exhausting all possible stationary excitations .",
    "it has been shown that the surface modes belong to one - parametric branches of solutions , which bifurcate either with other surface or with bulk modes , when the total power is properly changed .",
    "we have also found two - periodic modes , surface breathers , whose intensity periodically oscillates staying localized about the edge of the array , and described a way of excitations of breathers starting with the respective surface modes .",
    "the reported solutions , being well localized at the two ( or four in the 2d case ) surfaces and at the same time showing nonzero intensity in the bulk of the array , can be of significant practical importance , by analogy with the polaritons assisting extraordinary transmittancy  @xcite .",
    "meantime we emphasize a number of open questions which were left unanswered by the present research . among those we mention thorough study of the linear stability of the surface breathers , mathematical justification of the complete classification of the two - dimensional modes starting with the ac limit .",
