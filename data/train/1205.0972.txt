    ", please refer to @xcite .    considering the universe",
    "is described by the friedmann - robertson - walker metric and assuming a single udm besides baryons and radiation , the friedmann equation is expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the hubble constant today , and @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the critical density today .",
    "the subscripts r , b , k and x represent for radiation , baryons , curvature and udm component respectively . each component satisfies the energy - momentum conservation equation @xmath26    for the radiation and baryons , the equations of state are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the conservation equation gives @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "for the udm , it is considered as an approximation to an barotropic fluid .",
    "since the equation of state @xmath31 is unknown , we assume a constant speed of sound @xmath32 which leads to the 2-parameter affine form @xmath33    combined with the conservation equation , we can regard this component as an effective cosmological constant plus a generalized dark matter which has a constant equation of state @xmath4 .",
    "the density evolves as @xmath34 where @xmath35 stands for the generalized dark matter , and @xmath2 stands for the effective cosmological constant component , @xmath36 .    the friedmann equation now can be expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent dimensionless radiation , baryon matter and curvature today . @xmath2 and @xmath4 are the parameters we introduced .",
    "* we notice that when @xmath41 , the udm model are equivalent to @xmath14cdm . in udm model , we can equivalently think that the generalized dark matter may has a non - zero equation of state . naturally , because the property of the effective cosmological constant component is the same as the one in @xmath14cdm , when the property of generalized dark matter is equivalent to the usual dark matter in @xmath14cdm , udm model totally becomes @xmath14cdm .",
    "*    * the speed of sound characterizes the perturbations to the dark matter density and pressure which are related to the microphysics . since we know litter about dark sector in our universe , the equation of state is introduced to describe the property of dark sector .",
    "however , it can not give us the information about the microphysics and other properties .",
    "the speed of sound can give information about the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , quintessence has @xmath42 .",
    "if we can confirm the sound speed that is below the speed of light , we can get further degrees beyond a canonical , minimally coupled scalar field .",

    "this perturbations will change the gravitational potential , thus affecting the geodesic of photons . as a result",
    ", the cosmic microwave background will be changed through the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect . in order to show the differences between udm mdoel and @xmath14cdm which corresponds to @xmath41 , we give the cmb temperature angular power spectrum in fig .",

    "these data were obtained through the measurement of differential ages of red - envelope galaxies known as `` differential age method '' .",
    "the aging of stars can be regarded as an indicator of the aging of the universe .",
    "the spectra of stars can be converted to the information of their ages , as the evolutions of stars are well - known .",
