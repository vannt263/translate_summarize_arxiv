    "for large classes of single - field , slow - roll inflationary models , the predictions for scalar and tensor fluctuations can be summarized as follows ( to lowest order in slow - roll ) @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the scalar spectral index , @xmath13 is the tensor to scalar ratio , and @xmath14 is the tensor spectral index . the equality @xmath15 expresses the well - known consistency relation @xcite .",
    "the slow - roll parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are related to derivatives of the hubble parameter @xmath18 as a function of inflaton field value @xmath19 : @xmath20\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath19 . for a wave - mode of interest , equation ( [ basics ] ) is to be evaluated at horizon crossing during inflation .",
    "this is equivalent to evaluating equation ( [ epsilon ] ) at the corresponding field value @xmath21 ( hereafter @xmath22 is used to denote the time of horizon exit ) , or , as is commonly done , at the corresponding @xmath5 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the proper time . here",
    "@xmath5 is the number of e - folds between the horizon exit of the scale of interest ( i.e. @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) and the end of inflation ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) .",
    "the end of inflation is defined to be the time when slow - roll ends .",
    "a hierarchy of flow equations tells us how the slow - roll parameters depend on @xmath5 @xcite : @xmath29 ( ^\\ell \\lambda ) + \\,^{\\ell+1}\\lambda\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 ranges from @xmath31 to in principle infinity , and @xmath32 s are the higher order slow - roll parameters . in understanding the dynamics of inflation ,",
    "it is also useful to remember the equation of motion for @xmath19 : @xmath33 , and the friedmann equation : @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath35 is the derivative of @xmath19 with respect to proper time , and @xmath36 is the inflaton potential @xcite .",
    "as expressed above , it is clear that @xmath5 plays an important role in determining the properties of observable fluctuations .",
    "one can imagine a bound on @xmath5 provides useful information about the fluctuations , although the precise manner depends on the particular model under consideration . to take a simple example , for chaotic inflation with a @xmath37 potential : @xmath38 ( where we have used the fact that @xmath39 at the end of inflation ) , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , leading to ( at the lowest order ) : @xmath42    the predictions of chaotic inflation then are quite sensitive to the precise value of @xmath5 , and this dependence holds for many inflationary models @xcite .",
    "this leads to an important question : what are the constraints on @xmath5 ?",
    "the wmap team @xcite fixed @xmath5 to be @xmath43 and then proceeded to show that their data excluded the @xmath8 model .",
    "reference  @xcite pointed out though that @xmath5 need not be fixed at @xmath43 , and loosening this constraint correspondingly loosens the constraints on the @xmath8 chaotic inflation model .",
    "it is not uncommon in the literature to allow @xmath5 to range up to @xmath44 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "first , we derive a bound on a slightly different quantity , which turns out to be more robust .",
    "let us @xcite define @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the comoving wavenumber of interest , @xmath47 is the scale factor and @xmath48 is the hubble parameter , both at the end of inflation .",
    "hereafter the subscript @xmath49 refers to the end of inflation . in other words",
    ", @xmath50 is the ratio of the physical wavelength @xmath51 to the hubble radius @xmath52 at the end of inflation .",
    "it can be calculated backwards from today : there is a symmetry in the evolution of @xmath53 . during inflation",
    "this ratio increases from unity at horizon crossing to @xmath50 , and then after inflation it falls back to unity once the scale re - enters the horizon .",
    "the bound can be derived by extrapolating backwards from today to get @xmath47 as a function of @xmath48 , so that @xmath10 is solely a function of @xmath48 and then arguing that @xmath48 is less than or equal to @xmath54 .",
    "let us now develop the argument in more detail to make sure we arrive at a conservative bound .",
    "naively , one expects @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the radiation density today in units of the critical density , with @xmath57 ( @xmath58 km / s / mpc ) parametrizing the hubble constant today .",
    "taking into account changes in the number of relativistic species , as well as the possibility of decoupled degrees of freedom ( e.g. neutrinos today ) , one should use instead @xmath59^{1/2}$ ] . here",
    ", @xmath60 is the effective degrees of freedom that relates the energy density @xmath61 to temperature @xmath62 : @xmath63 , while @xmath64 relates the entropy density @xmath65 to @xmath62 : @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath60 and @xmath64 were identical , then the factor in square brackets would be @xmath67 , smaller than @xmath68 since the standard model alone contains more than @xmath58 relativistic degrees of freedom at very high temperatures .",
    "the difference between the @xmath60 s @xcite mitigates this to some extent and is somewhat model dependent ; a conservative bound follows from setting the coefficient to unity , so @xmath69 .",
    "thus , @xmath70 using now the weak assumption that @xmath54 , the hubble parameter in the early part of inflation when the fluctuation leaves the horizon , is larger than @xmath48 , we arrive at @xmath71 note that @xmath10 is a function of scale @xmath46 .",
    "the scale @xmath72 mpc@xmath73 is well - measured by the cmb , so it is a convenient pivot spot  @xcite .",
    "there is one possible loophole in eq .",
    "( [ eq : first ] ) .",
    "the end of slow - roll ( @xmath47 ) is generally earlier than the time when the universe finally completes reheating to become radiation dominated .",
    "equation ( [ eq : first ] ) assumes that this transition is instantaneous , but relaxing this assumption only strengthens the inequality . to see this , for a given @xmath48 ,",
    "define a quantity @xmath74 , which is the scale factor if one were to extrapolate backward from the end of reheating to a time when the hubble parameter is @xmath48 , as if the universe remains radiation dominated between these two times . with the weak assumption that the true hubble parameter should fall slower than @xmath75 between these two times , one can see that @xmath76 . combining this with the relation @xmath77 gives us back the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : first ] ) .",
    "the gravity wave amplitude is proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "a conservative bound ( @xmath78 ) from observations of the cmb anisotropies is @xmath79 gev @xcite .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ eq : nlimit ] ) constrains  @xcite @xmath80 the largest observable scale today corresponds to @xmath81 , implying the largest possible observationally relevant @xmath10 is @xmath82 .",
    "we refer to this limit on @xmath10 as the _ horizon ratio bound _ , as it derives from comparing the horizon today with that at the end of inflation .",
    "an important assumption is that the hubble parameter does not fall faster than @xmath75 after the end of inflation i.e. the energy density does not redshift faster than radiation .",
    "if , for instance , there is an extended period of domination by a kinetic - energy - dominated scalar field ( @xmath83 ) , the above bound would be violated . on the other hand , periods of late entropy production or secondary inflation",
    "would only serve to strengthen our bound .",
    "this caveat aside , our bound is quite general ",
    "it is independent of the exact model of inflation .",
    "the amount of expansion between horizon exit and the end of inflation is given by @xmath84 .",
    "following equation ( [ eq : first ] ) , we see that @xmath85\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term inside the square brackets can be bounded using the gravity wave amplitude as before .",
    "the first is the square root of the ratio of the hubble parameter at exit and at the end of inflation .",
    "this ratio can be rewritten using equations ( [ epsilon ] ) and ( [ nfold ] ) : @xmath86 as a function of @xmath5 is given by @xmath87 $ ] @xcite .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath88 the integral over @xmath16 introduces a dependence on the inflation model to the bound on @xmath5 .",
    "the weakest statement one could make is that @xmath89 during inflation , and so the integral has to be less than @xmath5 , implying a bound on @xmath5 that is weaker than the one on @xmath10 by a factor of 2 . imposing the requirement that inflation has to end before nucleosynthesis ( temperature @xmath90 mev ) strengthens",
    "this bound somewhat to @xmath91 .",
    "this is our most general model - independent bound on @xmath5 .",
    "= 0.95    however , generic single - field slow - roll models ( including hybrid models as effective single - field models ) likely obey a significantly stronger bound on @xmath5 .",
    "we perform an integration of the flow equations ( equation [ flow ] ) up to the 5th order in slow - roll ( i.e. @xmath92 ) , for a million randomly generated models in the slow - roll parameter space , following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the trajectories of @xmath16 can be used to evaluate the integral in equation ( [ nepsilon ] ) .",
    "we solve for the resulting bound on @xmath5 for each model , whose probability distribution is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pdf ] .",
    "it appears there is an upper limit on @xmath5 : @xmath93 we do find , however , some evidence for a weak increase in this upper bound as one truncates the slow - roll flow equations at higher orders .",
    "we therefore recommend using equation ( [ nepsilon ] ) to evaluate the appropriate bound on a case by case basis .",
    "an instructive example to see why the model - dependent correction to the @xmath5-bound is small is chaotic inflation with a @xmath8 potential . from ",
    "[ review ] , we know @xmath94 , and so @xmath95 . plugging this into equation ( [ nepsilon ] ) implies a bound of @xmath96 .",
    "such a modest @xmath5 for the @xmath8 model runs the danger of producing too much spectral tilt and/or too high a tensor to scalar ratio ( equation [ chaoticn ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the combination of wmap with seven other cmb experiments rules out the @xmath8 model at @xmath97 unless @xmath5 is larger than @xmath98 .",
    "this , together with our bound , appears to rule out @xmath8 chaotic inflation .",
    "however , we caution that @xcite combined different experiments assuming independence .",
    "in summary , we have derived a model - independent upper limit of about @xmath99 on the ratio of wavelength to horizon size at the end of inflation ( equation [ ncon ] ) .",
    "a corresponding model - dependent upper limit on @xmath3 , which is the amount of expansion between horizon exit and the end of inflation , is given in equation ( [ nepsilon ] ) .",
    "for vast classes of slow - roll models , we find that this gives a bound of @xmath100 .",
    "the discussion so far points to two different ways of implementing the horizon - ratio bound .",
    "one is to use equation ( [ nepsilon ] ) and evaluate the model - dependent correction on a case by case basis .",
    "the other is to bypass the use of @xmath5 altogether .",
    "it can be shown from equations ( [ epsilon ] ) and ( [ nfold ] ) that @xmath101 this can be used to rewrite the flow equations ( [ flow ] ) using @xmath10 instead of @xmath5 as the independent variable .",
    "the predictions for inflationary fluctuations can therefore be expressed in terms of @xmath10 in place of @xmath5 .",
    "our robust bound on @xmath10 can be implemented directly .",
    "we will explore this further in a subsequent paper .",
    "this constraint is a useful addition to the host of other constraints emerging from cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "we thank josh frieman , will kinney , rocky kolb , and andrew liddle for useful conversations .",
    "we are indebted to christian armendariz - picon for pointing out an important loophole in an earlier version of our paper .",
