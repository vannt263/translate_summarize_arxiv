    "parametric amplifiers are attractive in that they can in principle amplify a signal while only adding a minimum of noise@xcite . from this point of view , parametric amplifiers may be divided into two groups ; _ phase sensitive _ amplifiers which amplify only one of the incoming quadratures , and _ phase insensitive _ amplifiers which amplify both quadratures , thereby preserving the phase of the signal .",
    "a phase sensitive amplifier can in principle amplify the signal without adding any noise . the minimum noise added by a phase insensitive amplifier corresponds to half a quantum of the amplified frequency , @xmath0 .    in a parametric amplifier , some parameter of the system",
    "must be varied in time . by pumping the system , _",
    "i.e. _ modulating that parameter at one frequency , it is possible to amplify a signal at a different frequency .",
    "power is transferred from the pump frequency to the signal frequency .",
    "parametric amplifiers can be realized in a large number of systems , both in optics and in electronics .",
    "a typical example in optics is a fiber - based amplifier where the refractive index of the fiber material is modulated by the pump . in other systems utilizing varactor diodes , it is the nonlinear diode capacitance which is modulated .",
    "varactor diodes are typically used at frequencies ranging from radio to thz frequencies .",
    "superconducting circuits can also be used to build parametric amplifiers in the microwave domain .",
    "the use of parametric amplifiers with josephson junctions was pioneered by several researchers in the 1970s@xcite , as well as bernard yurke in the 1980s@xcite .",
    "josephson junctions are used as parametric inductances , and may be pumped either by a time varying current through the junction@xcite , or in a squid geometry by a time - varying magnetic flux@xcite .",
    "alternatively the kinetic inductance of a thin superconductor can be used as the parametric component@xcite .",
    "parametric amplifiers based on superconducting devices have recently regained interest because of the need for better amplifiers for qubit readout and microwave quantum optics .",
    "the utility of these amplifiers have been demonstrated in a number of experiments showing single shot qubit readout@xcite , quantum feedback@xcite , vacuum squeezing@xcite , and in determining the statistics of nonclassical photon states@xcite .",
    "there are two major advantages of superconducting parametric amplifiers : i ) they have very low dissipation , and ii ) they have well characterized and engineer - able properties .",
    "this makes it possible to design well functioning parametric amplifiers with good gain and little added noise@xcite .    to understand and implement a parametric amplifier ,",
    "one often needs to solve a system of coupled equations where it may be difficult to fully appreciate the amplifier s overall properties .",
    "along with the resurgent use of parametric amplifiers as applied to quantum systems , a quantum optics formalism is also typically adopted to explain the amplifier .",
    "by contrast , we recently presented a linearized impedance model for a flux - pumped squid following the engineering formalism@xcite developed for ( classical ) varactor diodes in the 1960 s and 70 s . while a similar formalism had also been utilized for early treatments of josephson junction parametric amplifiers@xcite ,",
    "this had not been applied to the flux - pumped squid .",
    "the flux - pumped squid can be represented as a parallel combination of a josephson inductance and an additional circuit element which we named the  pumpistor\"@xcite .",
    "the pumpistor has the frequency dependence of an inductance , but it is an inductance which is _",
    "complex_. the phase of this complex inductance ( or impedance ) depends on the phase angle of the pump relative to the signal . by properly adjusting the pump ,",
    "the pumpistor can act as a negative resistance .",
    "thus , it can provide gain in the circuit .",
    "in this recent paper , we treated only the three - wave degenerate case , _",
    "i.e. _ where the pump is applied at exactly twice the signal frequency .    in this work",
    ", we extend this pumpistor model .",
    "we revisit the three - wave degenerate case to include higher - order saturation effects .",
    "we also explore the four - wave degenerate case , which couples to the pump at higher order .",
    "perhaps most importantly , we also treat the _ nondegenerate _ case , where the pump frequency is not a multiple of the signal frequency . here",
    "a matrix formalism provides for the exploration of many types of nondegenerate frequency mixing , which , in addition to gain as a negative resistance , also describes up- and down- conversion of a signal .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the relations between external magnetic flux , effective junction phase , and series current in a dc squid . in this work",
    ", we refer to a dc squid simply as a  squid , \" and we consider it free of parasitic internal impedances . to begin , we first consider a single josephson junction in order to introduce the josephson relations due to the _ dc _ and _ ac _ josephson effects@xcite .      in a josephson junction ,",
    "the _ dc josephson effect _ denotes the relation between the phase difference @xmath1 , _",
    "i.e. _ the difference in phase between the superconducting order parameters on either side of the junction , and the current @xmath2 which flows through the junction .",
    "this is given by @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the critical current for this single josephson junction , which is its maximum allowed super - current .",
    "the _ ac josephson effect _ relates the _ time derivative _ of the phase difference to the voltage , v , across the junction .",
    "@xmath5 where , @xmath6 is the _ superconducting flux quantum_. by taking the time derivative of eq . [",
    "eqn : dcjosephsoneffect ] and combining it with eq .",
    "[ eqn : acjosephsoneffect ] , we see that the josephson junction acts like an inductor , @xmath7 , with the _ josephson inductance _ @xmath8",
    "placing two josephson junctions ( `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' ) in parallel , we form a squid , where the currents combine as a sum .",
    "we adopt the sign conventions suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath9 going around the loop and returning to the same point , the phase can only subtend multiples of 2@xmath10 .",
    "we therefore find a quantization condition for the superconducting loop flux .",
    "we regard the phase differences to occur only at the two josephson junctions , _",
    "i.e. _ , neglecting the inductance of the loop .",
    "furthermore we assume that the two junctions are equal , @xmath11 , and we define the squid phase to be @xmath12",
    ". then we arrive at the squid current , @xmath13 we see that the squid acts just like a josephson junction , but with a critical current tunable by the external magnetic flux @xmath14 . note that our choice of sign convention following ref .",
    "@xcite eliminates the need for taking the _ absolute value _ of the quantity @xmath15 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : squidcurrent ] .",
    "this is not the case in the definition commonly used in other very good and popular references ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in any case , for this work we consider only the situation where @xmath16 . here , the quantity corresponding to @xmath15 is always positive regardless of convention .",
    "thus , we recover a device phenomenology similar to the single josephson junction depicted in eqs .",
    "[ eqn : dcjosephsoneffect ] and [ eqn : acjosephsoneffect ] .",
    "specifically , the squid acts as a tunable inductance such that @xmath17    in this section , we have defined the system of a squid by current and voltage relations similar to a single josephson junction .",
    "we found the squid to be tunable by an externally applied magnetic flux . using this framework , in the next section we examine the squid circuit response to a magnetic flux , _ applied dynamically_.",
    "we investigate how a squid responds as an impedance due to the presence of a periodic perturbation of the external magnetic flux . to this end , we assume the external flux is of the following form . @xmath18 here @xmath19 is a static ( `` quiescent '' ) magnetic flux , and we use a time - dependent perturbation of the form @xmath20 .    for convenience of notation , we define these following normalized flux amplitudes . @xmath21      for clarity , we take the opportunity to introduce a handful of electromagnetic disturbances necessary to understand our system .",
    "these small - signal disturbances occur at different frequencies .",
    "we follow the nomenclature for frequency terms as presented by blackwell and kotzebue@xcite .    regarding frequencies and how we label them , in this work we consider at most six frequencies due to possible mixing effects .",
    "foremost , we consider a `` signal '' exists at a frequency assigned to index 1 . for a parametric amplifier , the signal frequency serves as the frequency of both the input and output of the device .",
    "we shall the small - signal current at the signal frequency , for a given voltage at this same frequency .",
    "this gives us a `` signal impedance '' upon which we base our subsequent reasoning .",
    "some driven `` pump '' disturbance occurs at a frequency of index 3 .",
    "this pump frequency corresponds to the frequency at which the squid is driven externally .",
    "the pumping of the squid provides for a nonlinear interaction to occur .",
    "another frequency we consider is the `` idler '' frequency .",
    "an idler response comes about due to the nonlinear mixing between signal and pump . in the general case",
    ", we need to provide for the possibility for the idler response to exist , even if it remains as an internal state variable ( serving neither as an externally accessible input or output to the circuit ) . among the various topologies which allow frequency",

    "we delineate an idler as either a _ sum _ or a _ difference _ between signal and pump frequencies , for either the _ three - wave _ or _ four - wave _ case .",
    "an underlying principle of the parametric amplifier is that ( some portion of ) the power absorbed at the pump frequency is transferred to signal and idler frequencies , allowing for an amplified response .",
