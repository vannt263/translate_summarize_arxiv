    "the nature of the phase - transition in systems of a scalar matter field coupled to a massless gauge - field has a long history in condensed matter physics , dating at least back to the introduction of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory of superconductivity @xcite . at the mean - field level , ignoring spatial variations in gauge fields as well as matter fields leads to the prediction of a second order phase transition in the model , with classical mean - field exponents for all values of the gl parameter @xmath2 . the first attempt to seriously consider the role of fluctuations on the order of the metal - to - superconductor transition",
    "was made by halperin , lubensky , and ma @xcite , who found that ignoring matter - field fluctuations entirely , and treating gauge - field fluctuations exactly , resulted in a permanent first order transition for all values of @xmath2 , since the gauge - field - fluctuations produced an extra term @xmath3 in the matter field sector of the theory in three spatial dimensions , where the complex matter field is denoted by @xmath4 and represents the condensate order parameter .",
    "( in the context of particle physics , coleman and weinberg @xcite studied the equivalent problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking due to radiative corrections in the abelian higgs model in four space - time dimensions , finding the additional term @xmath5 , where the real matter field is denoted @xmath4 and represents a scalar meson . )",
    "subsequently , dasgupta and halperin@xcite found , using duality arguments in conjunction with monte - carlo simulations , that when gauge - field fluctuations and phase fluctuations of the scalar matter field are taken into account , but amplitude fluctuations are ignored , the phase transition is permanently second order@xcite .",
    "bartholomew @xcite then reported results from monte - carlo simulations for the case when also amplitude fluctuations are taken into account , concluding that the phase transition changes from first to second order at a particular value of the gl parameter @xmath6 . as far as this numerical value is concerned , note that the problem of finding a _ tricritical _ value @xmath7 separating first and second order transitions is extremely demanding even by present day supercomputing standards @xcite ( see below ) . using ingenious duality arguments , kleinert @xcite obtained that the change from first to second order transition should occur at @xmath8 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 that separates a first order ( discontinuous ) transition from a second order ( continuous ) one , defines a tricritical point @xcite , and will hereafter be denoted @xmath9 .",
    "note that to obtain the above result , it is necessary to allow for amplitude fluctuations in the superconducting order parameter , which become important for small to intermediate values of @xmath2 , but are totally negligible in the extreme type - iiregime @xmath10 .",
    "the critical properties of a superconductor may be investigated at the phenomenological level by the gl model of a complex scalar matter field @xmath4 coupled to a fluctuating massless gauge field @xmath11 .",
    "it is this feature of the gauge field that makes the gl model so difficult to access by the standard techniques employing the renormalisation group @xcite .",
    "the gl model in @xmath12 spatial dimensions is defined by the functional integral    @xmath13   \\label{glm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the charge coupling the condensate matter field @xmath4 to the fluctuating gauge field @xmath16 , @xmath17 is a self coupling , and @xmath18 is a mass parameter which changes sign at the mean field critical temperature .",
    "when all dimensionful quantities are expressed in powers of the scale represented by @xmath19 , the gl model may be formulated in terms of the two dimensionless parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in this case , @xmath22 is temperature like and drives the system through a phase transition , and @xmath23 is the square of the ginzburg - landau parameter .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath24 , the transition is either first order for @xmath25 , or continuous for @xmath26 @xcite .    in a recent paper@xcite ,",
    "we have determined @xmath27 .",
    "this corresponds to a tricritical value of the gl parameter @xmath28 , in rather remarkable agreement with the results of ref .  .",
    "_ moreover in ref .   it was also argued that this value of @xmath24 or @xmath2 is the demarkation value which separates type - iand type - ii superconductivity , rather than the classical mean - field value @xmath29 . _",
    "the connection can be made when one realizes that _ criticality _ at the metal - to - superconductor transition requires that topological defects of the matter field in the form of vortex loops are stable .",
    "on the other hand , there is a connection between critical exponents and geometric properties of a tangle of such vortex loops@xcite .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath30 of the vortex - loop tangle is connected to the anomalous scaling dimension @xmath31 @xcite of the matter field in a field theory of the vortex - loop gas , a theory dual to the original gl theory @xcite by the relation @xmath32 .",
    "since the anomalous scaling dimension is connected to the order parameter exponent @xmath33 of the dual matter field by the relation @xmath34 @xcite , it follows that a collapse of the vortex - loop tangle implies @xmath35 and hence @xmath36 indicative of a first order transition . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the spatial dimension of the system .",
    "now , a collapse of the tangle in turn implies an effective attraction between vortices , or type - ibehavior . on the other hand ,",
    "a stable vortex - loop tangle at the critical point , with fractal dimension @xmath37 , implies first of all type - iibehavior , but also @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and hence a second order transition .",
    "the above assertion , that the tricritical value of @xmath2 separates first order from second order metal - to - superconductor transition , and moreover also separates type - ifrom type - iibehavior when the system is on the phase - transition line @xmath40 , is in contrast to the conventional wisdom that type - iand type - iisuperconductivity is separated by @xmath41 .",
    "based on the above arguments , we have proposed the phase diagram shown in fig . 1 of ref .   which contains a new line separating type - iand type - ii superconductivity .",
    "the shape of this line was inferred from the observation that far from the phase transition , mean - field estimates of the boundary between type - iand type - iishould be precise , and hence this boundary should asymptotically approach @xmath41 from below as the temperature is reduced .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show directly , by computing the effective thermally renormalized interaction between vortices via large - scale monte - carlo simulations , that this quantity changes from being repulsive to attractive in the intermediate regime @xmath42/\\sqrt{2}$ ] .",
    "since the sign of the vortex - interaction is the microscopic diagnostics , in terms of vortex degrees of freedom , for distinguishing type - ifrom type - iisuperconductivity , the large - scale simulations we present in this paper confirm the above conjectures and plausibility arguments of ref .  .",
    "in an external field the gl model has classical solutions in terms of abrikosov flux tubes@xcite , or nielsen ",
    "olesen vortices@xcite , and the concept of type - iversus type - iisuperconductivity is based on the interaction between these vortices . for type - isuperconductors",
    "they attract each other , whereas for type - iisuperconductors the interaction is repulsive .",
    "abrikosov@xcite showed that at the _",
    "mean field _",
    "level type - iand type - iisuperconductors are separated at @xmath43 .",
    "we will refer to the value of @xmath2 separating type - ifrom type - iibehavior at @xmath44 , which we find varies with @xmath22 .",
    "it is not a sharply defined quantity , since it represents a crossover line .",
    "the exception is at @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "elaborate calculations of vortex interactions have been carried out @xcite , but none of these approaches take thermal fluctuations into account . a recent overview of superconductors with @xmath2 close to @xmath47 can be found in ref . , see also ref . .",
    "superconductors with @xmath48 were studied extensively in the 1960s and 1970s@xcite , and in particular measurements on the metals ta and nb demonstrated that the notion of a _ temperature independent _ value of @xmath44 was incorrect@xcite . at the time , this was explained with a mean - field theory involving three gl parameters @xcite .",

    "this is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fss ] and [ vfig ] .",
    "from figs .  [ fss ] and [ vfig ] we conclude that there is a crossover line separating effective attractive vortex interactions from effective repulsive ones , i.e. type - iand type - ii .",
    "this line can either be crossed by changing @xmath24 , i.e. ia@xmath131 iia , or by changing the temperature i.e. ib@xmath131 iibin fig .",
    "[ newfasediagram ] .",
    "this means that for @xmath24 values in a suitable range , we can have in principle have a _ temperature induced _ crossover from type - ito type - ii superconductivity .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath122 deviates significantly from the mean - field value of @xmath132 .",
    "deep in the type - iregime , we find clear evidence of _ attractive _ interactions . in the type - iiregime",
    "the repulsive interactions appear to be weak , and the results are essentially also consistent with two _ randomly placed _ vortex lines , i.e. not interacting , but not consistent with an attractive force between the vortices .",
    "therefore , what the results unequivocally show is that by fixing the material parameter @xmath24 and varying the temperature - like variable @xmath22 , the character of the effective pair - potential is altered inside the superconducting regime , significantly away from the critical line .      the simulations with @xmath81 , and the simulations with a real @xmath133 $ ] are quite different , and we will discuss them in turn .",
    "an important feature of _ all the simulations _ in the present work is _",
    "slow dynamics_.    for the @xmath81 simulation , where we have monitored @xmath99 , we find that deep in the type - iregime the simulations are quite straightforward , the vortices stay close together with only small fluctuations , and a moderate number of sweeps is sufficient to get good statistics .",
    "however when we increase @xmath24 towards @xmath80 the effect is _ not _ that @xmath99 stabilises at a higher value , instead we get get fluctuations between a type - ilike state where the two vortices are close together , and a type - iilike state with large vortex - vortex separation .",
    "this picture persists as @xmath24 is increased into the type - iiregime , the only difference is that the fraction of time spent in the type - ilike state state decreases .",
    "in fact the results of fig .  [ fss ] and",
    "[ vfig ] are in the type - iiregion quite close to what we would get from noninteracting vortices .",
    "what makes the simulations difficult is that moving a vortex line in the transverse direction is a _ global _ change , and thereby very slow .",
    "timeseries of @xmath99 show characteristic time scales of @xmath134 sweeps , so long simulations @xmath135 sweeps over the lattice are required to obtain acceptable accuracy .",
    "a truly high - precision determination of @xmath122 would surely benefit from a specialized algorithm for the mc updates .    to get good results one should take the @xmath136 limit .",
    "the conclusions from the results of fig .",
    "[ fss ] are based on this limit , whereas those drawn from figs .",
    "[ vfig],[distfig ] and [ newfasediagram ] are based on the fixed system size @xmath137 .",
    "we have not performed a systematic study of finite size effects , but the curves in fig .",
    "[ distfig ] _ do have _ subject to finite size effects in them .",
    "the trend is that curves move to the right upon increasing system size , this very likely explains the apparent discrepancy between the tricritical point ( where the @xmath138 limit has been applied ) , and the remaining points in fig .",
    "[ newfasediagram ] .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ glm ] is a continuum field theory , and @xmath122 is _ not _ a critical point , hence the continuum limit @xmath139 should be taken . our experience from the large - scale simulations performed in ref .",

    "we have therefore chosen to work with @xmath140 and focused our efforts on considering large systems and long simulations .",
    "the monte - carlo computations of @xmath121 have been even more time consuming , because we have had to do the simulations for 41 different values of @xmath89 .",
    "we have therefore limited ourselves to considering only the system @xmath141 , for a discussion of finite @xmath142 / finite @xmath53 effects see ref .  .",
    "the relaxation time for these simulations has been particularly long in the limits @xmath143 and @xmath144 , and we therefore have performed much longer simulations in these limits than for intermediate values of @xmath89 . from fig .",
    "[ wmfig ] and eq .",
    "[ wm : hel.tall ] it is seen that @xmath145 is a quantity of order @xmath146 whose finiteness originates in the difference between two @xmath147 quantities .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to get numerically precise results .",
    "this has in particular been the case in the limits @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the physical picture that emerges for the thermal renormalization of the vortex interactions , is the following . at low temperatures , for the @xmath2-values we consider ,",
    "the system is in the type - iregion with a fairly deep minimum in the effective pair - potential between vortices at short distances , leading to an attractive interaction . at very short distances",
    ", we find a steric repulsion on the scale of the lattice constants in the system due to the large coulomb barrier that must be overcome to occupy a link with two or more elementary vortex segments .",
    "this lenght scale represents the size of the vortex core in the problem . upon increasing the temperature to the vicinity of the line @xmath40",
    ", we do not find large transverse meanderings of the individual vortex lines as we move along each vortex line , rather the vortex lines are essentially straight .",
    "therefore , we believe that it is _ not _ entropic repulsion due to the bare steric repulsion in the problem , of the type which it seems reasonable to invoke for _ strongly _ fluctuating elastic strings @xcite that renormalizes the vortex interactions in the way that is seen in fig .",
    "rather , what appears to happen is that the vortex lines slosh back and forth in the minimum of the effective potential well as essentially straight lines .",
    "hence , to a larger and larger extent as temperature is increased , they experience the hard wall in the interactions at small distances , and the weak attraction at large distances , effectively washing out the minimum in the potential , thus making it effectively more repulsive .",
    "this is also seen in our simulations ( not shown in any of the figures ) when we monitor the transverse meandering fluctuations of each vortex line , @xmath150 , as well as the mean square fluctuations of the intervortex distance , @xmath151 , where @xmath99 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ vdist ] ) .",
    "the former is small deep in the superconducting regime , and remains small as the line @xmath40 in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "is approached , while the latter increases dramatically as the dotted crossover line is crossed .",
    "it is precisely this fact which makes the simulations extremely time consuming .",
    "one should however keep in mind that , since we are considering the full gl theory in our simulations , and not the linearized london limit , it is in any case a drastic simplification to view the effective interaction between vortices as a simple pair potential .    finally , we note that , although our present simulations , which by necessity are on finite - sized systems , indicate that the change from type - ito type - iibehavior is a crossover , we can not rule out the possibility that it is elevated to a true phase - transition in the thermodynamic limit . more work is needed to clarify if this is indeed the case , but this will have to await the next generation of massive parallell computers .",
    "questions that need to be addressed in this context , are : what is the order parameter of such a transition , and what symmetry , if any , is being broken .",
    "we have considered the effective interaction between two vortices in the full gl model , and how this effective interaction is influenced by thermal fluctuations .",
    "we have included fluctuations in the gauge fields , as well as the phase- and amplitude - fluctuations of the complex scalar matter field of the problem .",
    "we have found that the effective interaction changes from being attractive to being repulsive at @xmath80 .",
    "this means a change from type - ito type - iibehavior .",
    "we have found that @xmath80 is below the standard quoted value of @xmath152 , and is a function of the temperature - like parameter @xmath22 .",
    "this means that at the critical point , the value of the gl parameter that separates type - ifrom type - ibehavior is smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "the line @xmath122 appears to be a crossover , and not a true phase transition .",
