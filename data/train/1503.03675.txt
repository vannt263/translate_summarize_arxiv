    "the nasa space mission _ kepler _ was successfully launched on 7th march , 2009 . the main scientific goal of the mission was to discover earth - sized planets around sun - like stars @xcite .",
    "during may 2013 the satellite lost the second of its four reaction wheels ( the first one failed in july 2012 ) , preventing further observation of the original field . nevertheless , during the four years of near - continuous data collection , _ kepler _ produced photometric time series of an exceptional precision of a few ppm ( parts per million ) , which provide a unique and excellent database for studying variability due to pulsations in thousands of stars across the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram @xcite .",
    "asteroseismology is the only way to probe the internal structure of stars and significantly improve our understanding of stellar evolution .",
    "it provides direct tests of the modelling of processes taking place in stellar interiors , such as diffusion , transport of angular momentum @xcite , convective overshooting , mechanisms driving pulsations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the value of the mixing - length parameter in stars of different effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "the key ingredients for an asteroseismic study are precise pulsation frequencies , mode identification , and strong constraints on atmospheric parameters , such as effective temperature @xmath4 , surface gravity @xmath5 , chemical abundances , and rotational velocity @xmath6 .",
    "accurate values of the pulsation frequencies are provided by the ultra - precise _ kepler _ photometry .",
    "the accuracy of atmospheric parameters available from the _ kepler input catalogue _ ( kic ) @xcite is generally too low for asteroseismic modelling , particularly for stars of spectral types earlier than f0 @xcite .",
    "also , information on the stellar chemical composition and rotational velocity is lacking .",
    "therefore , high - resolution spectra which offer a wide range of information are needed to fully characterise _ kepler _ targets @xcite .    for more than a thousand _ kepler _ stars high- and medium - resolution spectra have been collected @xcite .",
    "these observations are summarized in the _ kepler asteroseismic science operations center _",
    "( kasoc ) database . in this paper , we focus on the analysis of high - resolution spectra of main - sequence a- and f - type stars .",
    "the main groups of pulsators among these objects are @xmath7scuti , @xmath8doradus , and @xmath8dor/@xmath7sct hybrid stars .",
    "the @xmath7sct stars are main - sequence or evolved stars situated in the classical instability strip .",
    "they pulsate in low - order radial and non - radial pressure modes ( p - modes ) with typical frequencies of 5 to 50d@xmath9 ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath8dor stars are pulsating variables with spectral types a7f5 that are on or close to the main - sequence and pulsate in high - order gravity modes ( g - modes ) with typical frequencies of 0.3 to 3d@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the instability strip for @xmath8dor stars partly overlaps with the @xmath7sct instability strip .",
    "the @xmath8dor variables are of particular interest in asteroseismology , as their g - mode pulsations probe the deep interiors of these stars , reaching their convective cores .",
    "additionally , these pulsators occupy a region in the h - r diagram where @xmath8dor - like g - mode pulsations , @xmath7sct - like p - mode pulsations and possibly solar - like oscillations can co - exist in a single star .",
    "this overlap means that some individual objects show g - mode as well as p - mode pulsations .",
    "these hybrid variables permit simultaneous probing of two distinct regions of the interior : the deep layers between the convective core and the envelope , where the g - modes propagate , and the outer layers of the envelope where the p - modes propagate @xcite .",
    "therefore , hybrid stars are key objects for testing stellar models with seismic techniques .",
    "@xcite found that the hybrid stars in the _ kepler _ field are spread over the entire @xmath7sct and @xmath8dor instability domains .",
    "the analysis of _ kepler _ data and kic parameters for 750 a and f stars presented by @xcite confirms this result .",
    "they found that 23% of their sample of a and f objects shows both @xmath7sct pulsations and low - frequency variations .",
    "@xcite analysed observations of 1568 @xmath7sct pulsators taken from the _ kepler _ archive and identified a group of @xmath7sct stars with low - frequency peaks similar to those characteristic for @xmath8dor stars .",
    "contrary to the results of @xcite and @xcite , these variables are located in the same region of the h - r diagram as the ground - based @xmath8dor pulsators and none is found in the @xmath7sct instability domain .",
    "the low frequencies are observed in the hotter stars , but their origin is not clear @xcite .",
    "a high - resolution spectroscopic analysis by @xcite found each of their 38 @xmath8dor stars to lie within the @xmath8dor instability strip .",
    "accurate stellar atmospheric parameters are clearly required to place @xmath8dor/@xmath7sct hybrids unambiguously in the h - r diagram .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in sect.[sec : observations ] , we describe observational data used in the analysis .",
    "details on the spectral classification methods are given in sect.[sec : classification ] .",
    "in sect.[sec : methods ] , we present all the methods applied for determining the atmospheric parameters of the investigated objects , the sources of possible errors , and discuss consistency of the results obtained from different approaches .",
    "the distribution of rotational velocities is presented and discussed in sect.[sec : rotational ] .",
    "the derived abundances of elements , their correlation with the other parameters and a sample of chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars are discussed in sect.[sec : abundances ] .",
    "positions of the analysed stars in the @xmath10    diagram , conclusions and future prospects are given in sect.[sec : conclusions ] .",
    "high - resolution spectra were collected for several hundred stars located in the _ kepler _ field - of - view .",
    "most of these spectra were obtained by chelle spectrographs attached to the mercator telescope , nordic optical telescope ( not ) , tautenburg 2-m alfred - jensch telescope ( tls ) , bernard lyot telescope and the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyse high - resolution spectra taken with the cross - dispersed , fibre - fed chelle spectrograph hermes ( high efficiency and resolution mercator chelle spectrograph ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) attached to the 1.2-m mercator telescope located on la palma ( canary islands , spain ) .",
    "the spectra have a resolving power @xmath11 and cover the spectral range from 3770 to 9000 .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio for an individual spectrum at 5500 is 80100 .",
    "the spectra have been reduced with a dedicated pipeline , which includes bias subtraction , extraction of scattered light produced by the optical system , cosmic ray filtering , division by a normalized flat - field , wavelength calibration by a tharne lamp and order merging .",
    "the normalisation to the continuum was performed manually by using the standard iraf procedure _ continuum_. most of the stars in our sample have @xmath12 .",
    "the spectra of rapid rotators are very difficult to normalize correctly in spectral regions rich in blended lines , e.g. for @xmath13 .",
    "for this reason , we checked the quality of our normalisation by fitting synthetic spectra to all balmer lines in the spectrum of each star .",
    "if the spectrum has been normalized correctly , all hydrogen lines can be fitted satisfactorily with the same .",
    "the process of normalization is otherwise repeated .",
    "for the few stars for which we have more than one spectrum , we analysed the averaged spectrum .",
    "the averaging process is applied after normalization and forms an additional test of the quality of the normalization process .",
    "the data analysed in this paper were collected in spectroscopic surveys carried out in the years 2010 to 2012 ( table[surveys ] ) .",
    "table[journal1 ] lists the analysed stars and gives their kic  numbers , dates of the observations , number of spectra , visual ( @xmath14 ) magnitudes , and spectral types from the literature and determined in this paper .",
    "we also provide notes on chemical peculiarity , binarity and pulsation characteristics .",
    "chemically peculiar stars in our sample were identified in the process of spectroscopic classification and confirmed by the detailed spectroscopic analysis afterwards .",
    "twenty stars were found to be double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb2 ) and the atmospheric parameters of these stars will be presented in a separate paper ( catanzaro  et .",
    "al , in preparation ) .",
