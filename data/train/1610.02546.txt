    "the extensive research on spintronics and valleytronics unveil that many binary degrees of freedom of electrons , e.g. , spin and valley can be used to improve the efficiency of electronic devices@xcite .",
    "economic consideration makes designing electronic devices with both various degrees of freedom and low power consumption quite an attractive study area .",
    "although various kinds of non - dissipative chiral ( helical ) modes have been theoretically proposed and experimentally realized@xcite , it is yet desirable to present an easy way to spatially separate all the chiral states to obtain currents with a pure degree polarization , such as pure spin ( valley ) current@xcite , as well as to independently manipulate them .",
    "particularly , the chiral states pushed away from the boundaries will be immune to the boundary perturbations@xcite , such as the dangling bonds and boundary defects , which generally are obstacles for the application of the topological edge states .",
    "when a system hosts two or more spatially separated chiral states , the influence of finite size effect on the chiral states may be significant@xcite .",
    "the size effect can induce a undesired gap if the two chiral states with same momentum have overlap in the real space .",
    "generally , one can eliminate the gap by shifting the momentum of the two chiral states@xcite .",
    "however , the influence of size effect on the spatial distribution of the chiral states would persist even if the spectrum is gapless .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme for spatially separating all the edge states of a quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) insulator with chern number @xmath0 based on two - dimensional honeycomb lattices to realize pure spin currents .",
    "the qah effect can be introduced into honeycomb lattices if one considers the haldane term , which was artificially proposed at first@xcite .",
    "but later , it turns out that the haldane term can be realized in laser - driven systems @xcite , where the low - energy electrons submit to the floquet theory@xcite .",
    "usually , the honeycomb lattices also may possess sizeable intrinsic spin - orbit coupling ( soc)@xcite , thus in such case the appearance of qah effect requires that the haldane term should dominate the soc .    in the presence of haldane term and soc , a qah insulator with @xmath1 can be generated . at each edge of the qah sample ,",
    "the two unipropagating edge states are of up - spin and down - spin respectively and thus , the edge current is spin unpolarized . by applying staggered sublattice potential to narrow strips along the two edges ,",
    "one pair of the edge states with down - spin can be pushed to the inner boundaries of the potential regions , while the other with up - spin will be still at the outer boundaries . with the help of local terminals ,",
    "the spatially separated pure spin currents can be independently extracted out . moreover , by additionally applying potentials on the outmost lattices of the sample , all the chiral states will reside around the valley points and the velocity of them can be valley dependent@xcite , giving rise to a perfect valley filter , as the counterpropagating chiral states are well separated in both real and momentum space .",
    "also , the spin and valley index of the inner chiral states can be switched by changing the sign of haldane term ( e.g. switching the polarized direction of the circularly polarized laser ) and the direction of the staggered potential .",
    "the finite size effect will induce an oscillation on the spatial distribution of the inner chiral states .",
    "interestingly , we find that a local rather than global manipulation tuning the boundary potential can effectively control the size effect induced oscillation .    our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the edge currents propagating along the edges of sample are spin unpolarized , as they simultaneously contain up - spin and down - spin . by applying suitable potential @xmath47 , four spin perfect polarized currents",
    "are generated propagating along the four interfaces @xmath58 respectively [ fig .",
    "2](a ) and [ fig .",

    "[ fig . 1 ] ) , pure spin currents can be extracted out whenever the distance between the four interfaces ( e.g. @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) are much larger than the spatial broadening of the chiral states , which generally can be satisfied by choosing suitable parameters as shown in fig .",

    "generally , the applied electric field and substrate can induce a weak rashba soc@xcite , which couples different spin modes@xcite .",
    "however , the pure spin currents proposed here are robust against a weak rashba soc , as all the chiral ( spin ) modes are spatially separated .    in the present model , a perfect valley filter also can be engineered by additionally applying boundary potentials @xmath65 on the outermost sites of sample ( marked by the red frame in fig .",

    ", all the four chiral states possess well - defined valley index and the velocity of them is valley dependent .",
    "since the counter - propagating chiral states are well separated in both real and momentum space , the valley filter and pure spin currents proposed here would be immune to short - range scatterers , as well as the long - range scatterers that are smooth at the atomic scale .",
    "in this section , we study the finite size effect on the chiral modes . without resorting to the detailed analysis , one can obtain several key features of the size effect : ( 1 ) size effect is induced by the interfaces of system , including the boundaries and the inner interfaces .",
    "the boundaries of sample would have stronger limit effect than that of the inner interface , as the electrons can pass through the inner interfaces but are forbidden to be out of sample .",
    "( 2 ) if the chiral modes intersect in the momentum space , the size effect can produce a width dependent gap [ fig .",
    "( 3 ) the wavefunction of the chiral mode is determined by the boundary conditions .",

    "the oscillation amplitude of @xmath81 generally can be controlled by changing @xmath59 and @xmath97 .",
