    "transport in superconducting systems of reduced dimensions ( thin films and wires ) is known to be strongly affected by fluctuations in the order parameter .",
    "a prominent manifestation of the role of fluctuations is the finite electrical resistance of narrow superconducting ( sc ) wires at any finite temperature @xmath1 below the bulk critical temperature @xmath5 , established when the wire thickness @xmath6 is reduced below the superconducting coherence length @xcite @xmath7 .",
    "the finite voltage drop along the wires is generated by phase  slips : these are processes whereby the superconducting phase slips by @xmath8 at points on the wire where superconductivity is temporarily destroyed .",

    "the advance of nanostructure fabrication techniques during the 1980 s opened up the possibility to study narrow wires of smaller diameter , down to a few 100  .",
    "the consequent weakening of superconductivity leads to enhancement of the rate of phase  slips , and results in a measurable finite resistance even at @xmath9 . in this low @xmath1 regime , however , thermal activation is considerably suppressed , and the dominant mechanism for phase  slips becomes quantum tunneling .",
