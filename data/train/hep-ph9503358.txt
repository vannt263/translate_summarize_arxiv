    "one of the testing grounds for various models of grand unification is calculating the strong coupling constant @xmath6 using , as input , the experimental values of the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the weinberg angle .",
    "these calculations have been repeatedly carried out in different models and under different assumptions ( for recent reviews see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "it has been shown , in particular , that the simplest grand unification based on the standard model ( sm ) and @xmath10 gauge group leads to too small a value of the strong coupling constant , @xmath11  @xcite and is , thus , ruled out  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , supersymmetric models generally predicted @xmath6 in agreement  @xcite with experimental data available at that time .",
    "a straightforward supersymmetrization of sm gives rise to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "actually , to fully specify the model one has to make an additional assumption about the pattern of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking .",
    "the most popular mechanism is that of soft breaking in which one adds to the lagrangian all possible soft susy breaking terms and treats them as independent parameters .",
    "such terms arise , _",
    "e.g. _ , when the mssm is coupled to supergravity  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism of generating soft terms is so deeply rooted that quite often in the current literature no distinction is made between the mssm _ per se _ and the mssm plus the assumptions of the minimal supergravity - based susy breaking .",
    "in fact , an overwhelming majority of papers devoted to even purely phenomenological studies of the mssm assume some ( but typically not all ) relations stemming from minimal supergravity , _",
    "e.g. _ , the relation between the mass parameters of the gauginos of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    encouraged by early studies  @xcite , many authors ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) then studied unification in the context of the mssm coupled to minimal supergravity .",
    "the set of susy breaking terms generated this way is quite restrictive .",
    "in particular , in the context of minimal @xmath14 supergravity the masses of all gauginos  gluinos of @xmath15 , winos of @xmath12 and the bino of @xmath13  turn out to be the same at the planck scale .",
    "similarly , the soft mass parameters of all squarks and sleptons are equal at that scale . in this restrictive model ,",
    "which was called constrained mssm ( cmssm )  @xcite , one assumes universal masses for all the gauginos ( @xmath16 ) and all the scalars ( @xmath17 ) at the gut scale , and often additionally imposes a mechanism of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb )  @xcite . accepting these assumptions",
    "one arrives at quite definite predictions for the spectra of masses of the model at the weak scale and for @xmath6 . for example",
    ", the gluino turns out to be roughly three times heavier than wino  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath6 generally decreases with increasing @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "restricting @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( or alternatively all the masses ) below roughly 1tev leads to @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "for example , an updated analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite quotes @xmath19 .",
    "the theoretical error here is mostly due to uncertainty associated with the so - called threshold corrections at the gut and low ( susy breaking ) scales and higher - dimensional non - renormalizable operators ( nro s ) in the gut scale lagrangian .",
    "the above prediction for @xmath6 was considered as a great success and the strongest evidence in favor of the mssm in light of the fact that , as was believed , the direct measurement of the strong coupling constant at lep and sld yields @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "recently it has been pointed out , however , that qcd can not tolerate such a large value of the coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "a wealth of low - energy data indicates that @xmath6 must be very close to 0.11  @xcite , three standard deviations below the alleged lep / sld value .",
    "a method of determining @xmath0 which seems to be clean theoretically is extracting @xmath0 from deep inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite .",
    "a similar number is obtained in the lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "another reliable approach is using  @xcite ( euclidean ) qcd sum rules .",
    "the observation of ref .",
    "@xcite motivated a new analysis of the @xmath21 sum rules  @xcite claiming the record accuracy achieved so far , @xmath22 the apparent clash between the low - energy determinations of the strong coupling constant and those at the @xmath23 peak may be explained  @xcite by contributions going beyond sm which were not taken into account in the global fits .",
    "it should be stressed that the two scenarios  large @xmath0 versus small @xmath0  can not coexist peacefully , as it is sometimes implied in the current literature .",
    "our starting point is the assumption that the large @xmath0 option  @xcite , inconsistent with crucial features of qcd , will eventually evaporate and the value of the strong coupling constant at @xmath24 will stabilize close to 0.11 .",
    "in fact , in ref .  @xcite it has been argued that the systematic error usually quoted in the lep number is grossly underestimated , and that at present lep experiments can only claim @xmath25 .",
    "the question arises whether grand unification within the framework of the mssm can accommodate small @xmath2 .",
    "this study addresses this question .",
    "our task is to sort out assumptions ( sometimes implicit ) which are inevitable in analyses of this type and to find out which assumptions of the cmssm absolutely preclude one from descending to small @xmath6 and , therefore , have to be relaxed .",
    "there are several possible ways to reconcile the prediction for @xmath6 in supersymmetric grand unification with @xmath26 .",
    "one is to remain in the context of the cmssm but adopt a heavy susy scenario with the susy mass spectra significantly exceeding 1tev .",
    "this scenario would not only put susy into both theoretical and experimental oblivion but is also , for the most part , inconsistent with our expectations that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) should be neutral and/or with the lower bound on the age of the universe of at least some 10 billion years  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to invoke large enough negative corrections due to gut - scale physics .",
    "the issue has been reanalyzed in a very recent publication  @xcite . under a natural assumption ( the so - called no - conspiracy assumption )",
    "it was found that @xmath27 . relaxing this assumption",
    "one can , in principle , construct models of the cmssm with large negative contributions coming , say , from nro s which could decrease the value of @xmath6 by @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "( alternatively , one can entertain the possibility of an intermediate scale  @xcite around @xmath29 whose existence is motivated by other reasons . in this case , however , many more unknowns affect the running of the gauge couplings and one can not really talk about _ predicting _ @xmath6 . )",
    "none of these possibilities seem particularly appealing to us .",
    "although it may well happen that the gut - scale and nro corrections are abnormally large , the guiding idea of grand unification becomes much less appealing in this case , and the predicitive power is essentially lost . indeed ,",
    "by appropriately complicating gut - scale physics one could , perhaps , achieve gauge coupling unification even in the standard model .    below we will discuss an alternative route .",
    "we will adopt a down - to - earth , purely phenomenological attitude , with no assumptions about mechanisms of susy breaking .",
    "we do not assume @xmath14 supergravity , nor any mass relations associated with this scheme , for instance , the equality of the gaugino masses at the gut scale .",
    "if no theoretical scheme for the mass generation of susy partners is specified one is free to consider any values of these masses .",
    "our task is to try to find out what pattern of masses is preferred by phenomenology .",
    "we consider the mssm and limit ourselves to a  minimal set \" of assumptions : ( i ) all gauge coupling constants are exactly equal to each other at the gut scale ; ( ii ) the breaking of supersymmetry occurs below 1tev .",
    "we will show that by relaxing the cmssm to the mssm one can easily descend to @xmath30 .",
    "the only effect which is actually important in dramatically reducing the minimal value of @xmath6 is untying the gluino and wino masses .",
    "one firm conclusion is a relatively light gluino ( in the ballpark of 100gev , and typically below 200gev ) and a relatively heavy wino ( at least a few hundredgev ) , _ i.e. _ , a relation opposite to the one emerging in the cmssm .",
    "this summarizes our main results .",
    "the procedure for predicting @xmath6 assuming gauge coupling unification has been adequately described in the literature ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and we will only summarize it briefly here . the strategy is simple : the coupling constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( which are known more accurately than @xmath0 ) are evolved from their experimental values at @xmath24 up to the point where they intersect ( which thus defines the unification scale @xmath33 and the gauge strength @xmath34 ) . at that point",
    "one identifies @xmath0 with @xmath34 and runs it down to @xmath24 , thus predicting the value of @xmath6 as a function of input parameters . one- and two - loop corrections",
    "are taken into account .",
    "the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) for the gauge couplings are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the one - loop coefficients @xmath39 of the @xmath40 functions for the gauge couplings change across each new running mass threshold . in the mssm",
    "they can be parametrized as follows  @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 .    in eqs .",
    "( [ b1:eq])([b3:eq ] ) @xmath43 stands for the ( mass degenerate ) higgsino fields , @xmath44 for the winos , the partners of the @xmath12 gauge bosons ( @xmath45 ) , and @xmath46 stands for the gluino , all taken to be mass eigenstates in this approximation .",
    "also , in this approximation @xmath47 stands for a heavy higgs doublet , as explained in ref .",
    "( the full 2-loop gauge coupling @xmath40-functions for the sm and the mssm which we use in actual calculations can be found , _",
    "e.g. _ , in ref .",
    "@xcite . )    eqs .",
    "( [ b1:eq])([b3:eq ] ) represent so - called leading log approximation and involves some simplifications",
    ". however , as we will argue later , it will be sufficient to present the basic points of our analysis and answer the question how low one could descend in the values of @xmath6 assuming only strict unification of the gauge couplings in the mssm .",
    "the prediction for @xmath6 depends on the adopted values of the input parameters : @xmath7 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "it also receives corrections from : the two - loop gauge and yukawa contributions , scheme dependence ( @xmath50 _ versus _",
    "@xmath51 ) , mass thresholds at the electroweak scale and , finally , the gut - scale mass thresholds and nro contributions .",
    "we will discuss these effects in turn now .",
    "the input values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 at @xmath52 can be extracted from the experimental values of @xmath53 and @xmath48 . for the electromagnetic coupling",
    "we take  @xcite @xmath54 recently , three groups have reanalyzed @xmath53  @xcite and obtained basically similar results : @xmath55 ( martin and zeppenfeld ) , @xmath56 ( eidelman and jegerlehner ) , and @xmath57 ( swartz ) .",
    "adopting even the largest ( central ) value of swartz would shift @xmath6 up by only 0.001  @xcite .",
    "the range of input values of @xmath48 is rather critical .",
    "this sensitivity is due to the fact that @xmath58 does not change between @xmath52 and the gut scale @xmath59 as much as the other two couplings .",
    "thus , a small increase in @xmath48 has an enhanced ( and negative ) effect on the resulting value of @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite implies that in the mssm @xmath61 .",
    "recently , both the cdf and d0 collaborations have reported discovery of the top quark and quoted somewhat higher mass ranges : @xmath62 ( cdf )  @xcite and @xmath63 ( d0 )  @xcite .",
    "such high ( central ) values of @xmath49 would lower @xmath48 and _ increase _ @xmath6 by 0.002 and 0.005 , respectively .    including the two - loop terms in the rge s increases @xmath6 by about 10% .",
    "there are two types of contributions to @xmath6 at the two - loop level .",
    "pure gauge term yields @xmath64 if one assumes susy in both one- and two - loop coefficients of the @xmath40 function all the way down to @xmath52 .",
    "this is the most important correction to the one - loop value of @xmath6 .",
    "if , instead , the two - loop coefficients of the pure gauge part are changed to their sm values at @xmath65 , one finds an additional shift @xmath66 .",
    "since this shift is negligibly small , we keep the two - loop coefficients supersymmetric all the way down to @xmath24 .",
    "corrections due to the yukawa - coupling contribution to the rge s are also small , although negative  @xcite . in the limit of large top yukawa coupling ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , as in the small @xmath69 scenario ) one finds @xmath70 while even in the extreme case of the large @xmath71 scenario ( @xmath72 ) @xmath73 , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .    above @xmath74tev",
    "we also change from the conventional @xmath50 scheme , that we use throughout this paper , to the fully supersymmetric @xmath51 scheme .",
    "the corresponding shift in @xmath6 is about 0.0002 and is negligible numerically  @xcite .    before proceeding to discussing in more detail the contribution from one - loop threshold effects ,",
    "a remark is in order on possible corrections from the gut - scale mass thresholds and nro s . since in this paper",
    "we look for an alternative way of lowering @xmath6 , we switch off all corrections from the gut - scale physics whatsoever . as was noted previously  @xcite they are gut - model dependent and , in principle , can be sizeable .",
    "for instance , according to refs .",
    "@xcite the corresponding effect in @xmath6 can be as large as @xmath75 ; a factor of 2.5 larger effect is needed , however , to ensure @xmath26 . building a fully elaborated and phenomenologically acceptable model of this type",
    "seems to be a task for the future .",
    "what remains to be done is to explain our treatment of the mass thresholds at the electroweak and susy scales .",
    "we use usual the step - like approximation in the coefficients of the @xmath40-function , eqs .",
    "( [ b1:eq])([b3:eq ] ) . in the one - loop coefficients",
    "the jumps occur at the positions of the masses of the individual particles while in the two - loop coefficients it is sufficient , to our accuracy , to consider one jump at a common susy scale , as explained above . as a matter of fact , with no loss of accuracy , we take this scale in the two - loop coefficients to be lower than @xmath24 so that in our evolution from @xmath33 down to @xmath24 we treat the two - loop coefficients as fully supersymmetric . also , the @xmath76 quark is not frozen at @xmath49 in the two - loop coefficients .",
    "it is well known that the step - like approximation is not absolutely accurate in the problem of the coupling constant evolution ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion ) , especially if the mass thresholds are rather close to @xmath24 , as is the case with @xmath76 quark .",
    "we find that the other thresholds are far less important , since , as we vary their positions , the effect of the variation mimics the non - logarithmic corrections omitted in the step approximation .",
    "the error in @xmath6 due to the inacuracy of our approximation of the @xmath0 evolution at @xmath49 is less than 1% and is , thus , unimportant .",
    "the question we want to address is whether supersymmetric grand unification necessarily predicts large values of @xmath77 as long as all susy masses are restricted to lie below 1tev .",
    "this is indeed the case in the cmssm with additional assumptions of common gaugino mass and common scalar mass , as described in the introduction .    in order to track the role of these mass relations we begin by treating the masses of the different types of states as completely independent parameters .",
    "we choose to remain open - minded and not biased by any additional ( even well - motivated ) assumptions about the parameters involved , other than the basic idea of gauge coupling unification .",
    "thus , we assume no relation between squarks and sleptons , or between the gauginos .",
    "( actually , the structure of supersymmetry alone forces certain relations between sfermion masses and gaugino masses , thus disallowing , for example , very light squarks and very heavy gauginos  @xcite .",
    "we will see below that this will not have any substantial effect on our results . )",
    "we also do not impose a mechanism of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we will see _ a posteriori _ that requiring ewsb will not change our conclusions significantly .    in fig .",
    "[ allmass : fig ] we show @xmath6 as a function of the mass of each relevant type of state . we assume all other masses to be degenerate and equal to either 100gev or 1tev . generally , we will treat all squarks and all sleptons as mass - degenerate .",
    "the only exception to this rule will be the scalar top states , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this is because their masses are typically expected to be significantly different from the other squarks and from each other .",
    "it is obvious from the form of the @xmath40-functions , eqs .",
    "( [ b1:eq])([b3:eq ] ) , that the resulting value of @xmath80 will most sensitively depend on two parameters only : the gluino mass @xmath81 and the soft mass parameter @xmath82 of the wino .",
    "the reasons are twofold : not only are their @xmath40-function coefficients among the largest but also they change only one out of the three @xmath39 s .",
    "[ allmass : fig ] clearly confirms our expectation .",
    "also , table  [ als : table ] shows @xmath6 for several choices of relevant parameters .",
    "the first four rows are meant to demonstrate the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath82 and @xmath81 .",
    "we are interested in the lowest possible values of @xmath6 allowed by ( strict ) grand unification . as it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ allmass : fig ] , minimization of @xmath6 requires minimizing @xmath81 and @xmath83 while simultaneously maximizing the masses of the wino , the sleptons , the higgsino , and of the heavy higgs .",
    "we have also verified that , in order to minimize @xmath6 , one should also set @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) at its lowest ( largest ) possible value . since the  standard \" prediction for @xmath6 emerging in the cmssm is quoted above under the assumption that all sparticles are lighter than 1tev we accordingly restrict all the masses to that range . at the lower end , we allow the masses to lie as low as @xmath86 .",
    "( lowering this limit down to @xmath24 would not noticeably change @xmath6  @xcite . ) in the last row of table  [ als : table ] we show the lowest value of @xmath6 obtained by varying all the mass parameters between 100gev and 1tev .",
    "experimental bounds on most of those states are still less than @xmath24 . even for @xmath81 and the masses of the squarks there are no inescapable lower bounds , other than roughly @xmath87 from lep  @xcite .",
    "( very recently , the d0 collaboration  @xcite has published new improved limits : @xmath88 for any @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath6 shows little dependence on the masses of the states other than the @xmath12 and @xmath15 gauginos .",
    "therefore one actually has considerable freedom in choosing the other masses as desired .",
    "this justifies our approach of assuming all sleptons to be mass - degenerate , and similarly with squarks .",
    "furthermore , relatively weak dependence of @xmath6 on the mass of the higgsino ( which we approximate by the higgs / higgsino mass parameter @xmath94 ) shows that imposing ewsb would probably not lead to any strong increase in the lower bound on @xmath6 .",
    "this is because the conditions of ewsb determine @xmath94 in terms of ( soft ) higgs mass parameters which influence @xmath6 even less .",
    "it is also evident from the gluino window of fig .",
    "[ allmass : fig ] that the mass of the gluino is strongly confined to rather small values in the range of a few hundred gev only .",
    "this is a distinctive feature and a strong prediction of our approach . the exact value of the upper bound on @xmath81 that one allows clearly depends on how large gut- related corrections one assumes and also how large values of @xmath6 one is willing to accept .",

    "@xcite shows that the correction can reach @xmath123 in each quark channel provided that @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "with such a correction the value of @xmath0 measured at the @xmath23 peak slides down by @xmath28 solving the problem in full .",
    "on the other hand , it seems extremely unlikely that the very same mechanism may be responsible for the alleged enhancement in the @xmath126 channel .",
    "indeed , if we take the central value for the experimental @xmath118 width , the excess over the theoretical expectation amounts to @xmath127 mev  @xcite , a factor of 5 larger than the excess produced by the gluino correction above .",
    "one would have to descend to unacceptably low squark and gluino masses to get this factor of 5 .",
    "recently , another possible solution of the @xmath128 problem was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "the mass parameters of the mssm were also considered as _ a priori _ unrelated .",
    "it was shown that , in order to induce large enough susy correction to reconcile the measured value of @xmath128 with the sm prediction , a relatively light ( below roughly 80gev ) higgsino - like chargino is required .",
    "the authors also need at least one stop with a significant @xmath79 component in the same mass range . in order to examine what predictions for @xmath6",
    "this scenario leads to we have set the higgsino mass parameter @xmath94 and @xmath83 at @xmath24 , and chosen all other mass parameters in such a way as to minimize @xmath6 , as before .",
    "we find @xmath129 .",
    "another problem where the relatively light gluino can help is the deficit of the semileptonic branching ratio in @xmath130 mesons and the charm multiplicity  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations of these quantities are at a rather advanced stage now .",
    "both perturbative and non - perturbative effects have been considered .",
    "the most detailed analysis of the non - perturbative effects is carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the conclusion that they can be essentially neglected in the problem at hand . as for perturbative calculations ,",
    "they have been repeatedly discussed in the literature .",
    "e.g. _ , recent papers  @xcite and references therein . )",
    "the theoretical prediction turns out to be rather sensitive to the choice of the value of @xmath0 and the normalization scale @xmath94 relevant to the process .",
    "smaller values of @xmath94 and larger values @xmath0 tend to enhance the non - leptonic width and , thus , lower the prediction for the semileptonic branching ratio . on the contrary ,",
    "larger values of @xmath94 and smaller @xmath0 suppress the non - leptonic width and enhance the branching ratio . the theoretical prediction can be made marginally compatible  @xcite with the data on the semileptonic branching ratio  @xcite provided that @xmath0 is chosen on the high side and @xmath94 on the low side . at the same time , if @xmath26 the prediction for br@xmath131 does not fall lower than 11.5%  @xcite , while the corresponding experimental number is @xmath132 .",
    "moreover , no reasonable choice of the parameters above allows one to eliminate a very substantial deficit in the charm multiplicity .",
    "both discrepancies evaporate if the @xmath130 non - leptonic decays receive a contribution from the @xmath133 + gluon transition , at the level of @xmath5 15% of the total width .",
    "then the theoretical prediction for br@xmath131 shifts down to 10.4% ; simultaneously , the charm multiplicity turns out to be within error bars . as was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in supersymmetric models such a transition can naturally arise , with the right strength , if the gluino and squark masses lie in the 100gev ballpark .",
    "what is important is that the additional graphs giving rise to @xmath133 + gluon transition do not spoil the @xmath133 + photon transition .",
    "indeed , the ratio of the photon to gluon probabilities is @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the down quark electric charge , and @xmath136 is a numerical factor including , among other effects , an enhancement of the @xmath133 + gluon transition due to the gluon radiative corrections . according to ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath137 to 3 . with @xmath119",
    "the ratio is close to @xmath138 .",
    "this means that the @xmath133 + gluon transition can well contribute at the level of 15% ; the corresponding contribution to the @xmath139 is at the level of @xmath140 , which is quite acceptable phenomenologically  @xcite .      it has been argued that , in the mssm alone , with no additional mass relations , the requirement of strict @xmath120@xmath121 mass unification can only be achieved in a relatively very narrow region of the ( @xmath141 ) plane for a wide range of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "however , it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that , if @xmath6 is small @xmath142 , the above strong relation between @xmath71 and @xmath49 can be significantly relaxed provided that strict unification condition @xmath143 at the gut scale is reduced somewhat ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "( see figs .",
    "1 and 2 of ref .  @xcite . )",
    "gut - scale uncertainties of this size are actually typically present in gut s  @xcite .",
    "the observation that the gauge coupling constants , which look so different at the electroweak scale , evolve and converge at a scale somewhat smaller than the planck mass was crucial in the original idea of grand unification  @xcite .",
    "later on , with more accurate data and more precise calculations available , it turned out that the gauge couplings do not intersect at one point .",
    "the fact that we are off by only a relatively very small amount is very encouraging and shows that the original idea is viable , and only details must be adjusted .",
    "this first led people from the sm to the mssm .",
    "this work concludes that , if @xmath6 is indeed close to @xmath145 , the gluino must be rather light , @xmath146 , and thus accessible to present direct searches .",
    "it is also gratifying to note that , with the mass of the gluino lying in this ballpark , other problems ( like the @xmath128 excess at lep , a deficit of the semileptonic branching ratio of b - mesons , _ etc . _ ) might find their solutions as well .",
    "finally , many studies of susy , including mass bounds on sparticles and dark matter searches , rely on the mass relations  ( [ monemtwo : eq])([mtwomgluino : eq ] ) .",
    "this analysis provides arguments for relaxing them .",
