    "nonlinear dimensionality reduction ( nldr ) algorithms address the following problem : given a high - dimensional collection of data points @xmath0 , find a low - dimensional embedding @xmath1 ( for some @xmath2 ) which faithfully preserves the ` intrinsic ' structure of the data . for instance , if the data have been obtained by sampling from some unknown manifold @xmath3  perhaps the parameter space of some physical system  then @xmath4 might correspond to an @xmath5-dimensional coordinate system on  @xmath6 . if @xmath6 is completely and non - redundantly parametrized by these @xmath5  coordinates , then the nldr  is regarded as having succeeded completely .",
    "principal components analysis , or linear regression , is the simplest form of dimensionality reduction ; the embedding function  @xmath4 is taken to be a linear projection .",
    "this is closely related to ( and sometimes identifed with ) classical multidimensional scaling  @xcite .",
    "when there are no satisfactory linear projections , it becomes necessary to use nldr .",
    "prominent algorithms for nldr  include locally linear embedding  @xcite , isomap  @xcite , laplacian eigenmaps  @xcite , hessian eigenmaps  @xcite , and many more .",
    "these techniques share an implicit assumption that the unknown manifold  @xmath6 is well - described by a finite set of coordinate functions @xmath7 .",
    "explicitly , some of the correctness theorems in these studies depend on the hypothesis that @xmath6 has the topological structure of a convex domain in some  @xmath8 .",
    "this hypothesis guarantees that good coordinates exist , and shifts the burden of proof onto showing that the algorithm recovers these coordinates .    in this paper",
    "we ask what happens when this assumption fails . the simplest space which challenges the assumption is the circle , which is one - dimensional but requires two real coordinates for a faithful embedding .",
    "other simple examples include the annulus , the torus , the figure eight , the 2-sphere , the last three of which present topological obstructions to being embedded in the euclidean space of their natural dimension .",
    "we propose that an appropriate response to the problem is to enlarge the class of coordinate functions to include circle - valued coordinates @xmath9 . in a physical setting , circular coordinates occur naturally as angular and phase variables .",
    "spaces like the annulus and the torus are well described by a combination of real and circular coordinates .",
    "( the 2-sphere is not so lucky , and must await its day . )    the goal of this paper is to describe a natural procedure for constructing circular coordinates on a nonlinear data set using techniques from classical algebraic topology and its 21st - century grandchild , persistent topology .",
    "we direct the reader to  @xcite as a general reference for algebraic topology , and to  @xcite for a streamlined account of persistent homology .",
    "there have been other attempts to address the problem of finding good coordinate representations of simple non - euclidean data spaces .",
    "one approach  @xcite is to use modified versions of multidimensional scaling specifically devised to find the best embedding of a data set into the cylinder , the sphere and so on .",
    "the target space has to be chosen in advance .",
    "another class of approaches  @xcite involves cutting the data manifold along arcs and curves until it has trivial topology .",
    "the resulting configuration can then be embedded in euclidean space in the usual way . in our approach , the number of circular coordinates is not fixed in advance , but is determined experimentally after a persistent homology calculation .",
    "moreover , there is no cutting involved ; the coordinate functions respect the original topology of the data .",
    "the principle behind our algorithm is the following equation from homotopy theory , valid for topological spaces  @xmath10 with the homotopy type of a cell complex ( which covers everything we normally encounter ) : @xmath11 = { \\operatorname{\\mathrm{h}}}^1(x ; { \\mathbb{z}})\\ ] ] the left - hand side denotes the set of equivalence classes of continuous maps from @xmath10 to the circle  @xmath12 ; two maps are equivalent if they are homotopic ( meaning that one map can be deformed continuously into the other ) ; the right - hand side denotes the 1-dimensional cohomology of  @xmath10 , taken with integer coefficients . in other",
    "language : @xmath12 is the classifying space for @xmath13 , or equivalently @xmath12 is the eilenberg",
    " maclane space @xmath14 .",
    "see section  4.3 of  @xcite .    if @xmath10 is a contractible space ( such as a convex subset of  @xmath8 ) , then @xmath15 and equation   tells us not to bother looking for circular functions : all such functions are homotopic to a constant function .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath10 has nontrivial topology then there may well exist a nonzero cohomology class @xmath16 \\in { \\operatorname{\\mathrm{h}}}^1(x ; { \\mathbb{z}})$ ] ; we can then build a continuous function @xmath17 which in some sense reveals @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "our strategy divides into the following steps .    1 .",
    "represent the given discrete data set as a simplicial complex or filtered simplicial complex .",
    "2 .   use persistent cohomology to identify a ` significant ' cohomology class in the data . for technical reasons",
    ", we carry this out with coefficients in the field @xmath18 of integers modulo  @xmath19 , for some prime  @xmath19 .",

    "5 .   integrate the harmonic cocycle @xmath23 to a circle - valued function @xmath24 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : coho ] , we derive what we need of equation  . steps ( 15 ) of the algorithm",
    "are addressed in sections [ sec : pcd2sc][sec : integration ] , respectively . in section  [",
    "sec : examples ] we report some experimental results .",
    "let @xmath10 be a finite simplicial complex .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the sets of vertices , edges and triangles of  @xmath10 , respectively . we suppose that the vertices are totally ordered ( in an arbitrary way ) . if @xmath26 then the edge between vertices @xmath27 is always written @xmath28 and not @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath30 then the triangle with vertices @xmath31 is always written @xmath32 .",
    "cohomology can be defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath33 be a commutative ring ( for example @xmath34 ) .",
    "we define 0-cochains , 1-cochains , and 2-cochains as follows : @xmath35 these are modules over  @xmath33 .",
    "we now define coboundary maps @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "it is unique up to adding constants on each connected component of  @xmath10 .",
    "it is easily verified that @xmath44 for any @xmath42 .",
    "thus , coboundaries are always cocycles , or equivalently @xmath45 .",
    "we can measure the difference between coboundaries and cocycles by defining the 1-cohomology of  @xmath10 to be the quotient module @xmath46 we say that two cocycles @xmath47 are _ cohomologous _ if @xmath48 is a coboundary .",
    "we now consider integer coefficients .",
    "the following proposition fulfils part of the promise of equation  , by producing circle - valued functions from integer cocycles",
    ". it will be helpful to think of @xmath12 as the quotient group @xmath49 .",
    "[ prop : integer ] let @xmath50 be a cocycle .",

    ".    we can define @xmath53 inductively on the vertices , edges , triangles ,   of  @xmath10 .",
    "the vertices and edges follow the prescription in the statement of the proposition . to extend @xmath53 to the triangles , it is necessary that the winding number of @xmath53 along the boundary of each triangle @xmath32 is zero . and",
    "indeed this is @xmath54 .",
    "since the higher homotopy groups of @xmath12 are all zero ( @xcite , section  4.3 ) , @xmath53 can then be extended to the higher cells of  @xmath10 without obstruction .",
    "the construction in proposition  [ prop : integer ] is unsatisfactory in the sense that all vertices are mapped to the same point .",
    "all variation in the circle parameter takes place in the interior of the edges ( and higher cells ) .",
    "this is rather unsmooth . for more leeway ,",
    "we consider real coefficients .",
    "[ prop : real ] let @xmath55 be a cocycle .",

    "in other words , we can construct a circle - valued function out of any real cocycle @xmath59 whose cohomology class @xmath60 $ ] lies in the image of the natural homomorphism @xmath61 .",
    "define @xmath53 on the vertices of  @xmath10 by setting @xmath62 to be @xmath63 mod  @xmath64 . for each edge @xmath28 , we have @xmath65 which is congruent to @xmath66 mod  @xmath64 , since @xmath52 is an integer .",
    "it follows that @xmath53 can be taken to map @xmath28 linearly onto an interval of signed length @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath59 is a cocyle , @xmath53 can be extended to the triangles as before ; then to the higher cells .",
    "proposition  [ prop : real ] suggests the following tactic : from an integer cocycle  @xmath21 we construct a cohomologous real cocycle @xmath67 , and then define @xmath68 mod  @xmath64 on the vertices of  @xmath10 . if we can construct @xmath59 so that the edge - lengths @xmath69 are small , then the behaviour of @xmath53 will be apparent from its restriction to the vertices .",
    "see section  [ sec : smooth ] .",
    "we now begin describing the workflow in detail .",
    "the input is a point - cloud data set : in other words , a finite set @xmath70 or more generally a finite metric space .",
    "the first step is to convert @xmath71 into a simplicial complex and to identify a stable - looking integer cohomology class .",
    "this will occupy the next three subsections .",
    "the first lesson of point - cloud topology  @xcite is that point - clouds are best represented by 1-parameter nested families of simplicial complexes .",
    "there are several candidate constructions : the vietoris ",
    "rips complex @xmath72 has vertex set  @xmath71 and includes a @xmath73-simplex whenever all @xmath74 vertices lie pairwise within distance @xmath75 of each other .",
    "the witness complex @xmath76 uses a smaller vertex set  @xmath77 and includes a @xmath73-simplex when the @xmath74 vertices lie close to other points of  @xmath71 , in a certain precise sense ( see @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "@xmath78 whenever @xmath79 .",
    "either of these constructions will serve our purposes , but the witness complex has the computational advantage of being considerably smaller .",
    "we determine @xmath80 only up to its 2-skeleton , since we are interested in @xmath13 .",
    "having constructed a 1-parameter family @xmath81 , we apply the principle of persistence to identify cocycles that are stable across a large range for  @xmath75 .",
    "suppose that @xmath82 are the critical values where the complex @xmath80 gains new cells .",
    "the family can be represented as a diagram @xmath83 of simplicial complexes and inclusion maps .",
    "for any coefficient field  @xmath84 , the cohomology functor @xmath85 converts this diagram into a diagram of vector spaces and linear maps over  @xmath84 ; the arrows are reversed : @xmath86 according to the theory of persistence  @xcite , such a diagram decomposes as a direct sum of 1-dimensional terms indexed by half - open intervals of the form @xmath87 .",
    "each such term corresponds to a cochain @xmath88 that satisfies the cocycle condition for @xmath89 and becomes a coboundary for @xmath90 .",
    "the collection of intervals can be displayed graphically as a _ persistence diagram _",
    ", by representing each interval @xmath91 as a point @xmath92 in the cartesian plane above the main diagonal .",
    "we think of long intervals as representing trustworthy ( i.e.  stable ) topological information .",
    "choice of coefficients .",
    "the persistence decomposition theorem applies to diagrams of vector spaces over a field .",
    "when we work over the ring of integers  @xmath64 , however , the result is known to fail : there need not be an interval decomposition .",
    "this is unfortunate , since we require integer cocycles to construct circle maps . to finesse this problem",
    ", we pick an arbitrary prime number  @xmath19 ( such as @xmath93 ) and carry out our persistence calculations over the finite field @xmath94 .",
    "the resulting @xmath18 cocyle must then be converted to integer coefficients : we address this in section  [ sec : lift ] .",
    "in principle we can use the ideas in  @xcite to calculate the persistent cohomology intervals and then select a long interval @xmath87 and a specific @xmath95 .",
    "we then let @xmath96 and take @xmath21 to be the cocycle in @xmath97 corresponding to the interval .",
    "explicitly , persistent cocycles can be calculated in the following way .",
    "we thank dmitriy morozov for this algorithm .",
    "suppose that the simplices in the filtered complex are totally ordered , and labelled @xmath98 so that @xmath99 arrives at time  @xmath100 .",
    "for @xmath101 we maintain the following information :    * a set of indices @xmath102 associated with ` live ' cocycles ; * a list of cocycles @xmath103 in @xmath104 .",
    "the cocycle @xmath105 involves only @xmath99 and those simplices of the same dimension that appear later in the filtration sequence ( thus only @xmath106 with @xmath107 ) .    initially @xmath108 and the list of cocycles is empty .    to update from @xmath109 to @xmath73 , we compute the coboundaries of the cocycles @xmath110 of  @xmath111 within the larger complex @xmath112 obtained by including the simplex @xmath113 .",
    "in fact , these coboundaries must be multiples of the elementary cocycle @xmath114 $ ] defined by @xmath115 , and @xmath116 otherwise .",
    "we can write @xmath117 $ ]",
    ". if all the @xmath118 are zero , then we have one new cocycle : let @xmath119 and define @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "otherwise , we must lose a cocycle .",
    "let @xmath121 be the largest index for which @xmath122 .",
    "we delete @xmath123 by setting @xmath124 , and we restore the earlier cocycles by setting @xmath125 . in this latter case , we write the persistence interval @xmath126 to the output .    at the end of the process , surviving cocycles are associated with semi - infinite intervals : @xmath127 for @xmath128 .    remark",
    ". the reader may be more familiar with persistence diagrams in homology rather than cohomology .",
    "in fact , the universal coefficient theorem  @xcite implies that the two diagrams are identical .",
    "the salient point is that cohomology is the vector - space dual of homology , when working with field coefficients .",
    "that said , we can not simply use the usual algorithm for persistent homology : we are interested in obtaining explicit cocycles , whereas the classical algorithm  @xcite returns cycles",
    ".    we will establish the correctness of this algorithm in the archival version of this paper .",
    "the expert reader may regard this as an exercise in the theory of persistence .",
    "we now have a simplicial complex @xmath96 and a cocycle @xmath129 .",
    "the next step is to ` lift ' @xmath130 by constructing an integer cocycle  @xmath21 which reduces to @xmath130 modulo  @xmath19 .    to show that this is ( almost ) always possible ,",
    "note that the short exact sequence of coefficient rings @xmath131 gives rise to a long exact sequence , called the bockstein sequence ( see section 3.e of  @xcite ) .",
    "here is the relevant section of the sequence : @xmath132 by exactness , the bockstein homomorphism  @xmath133 induces an isomorphism between the cokernel of @xmath134 and the kernel of @xmath135 , and this kernel is precisely the set of @xmath19-torsion elements of @xmath136 .",
    "if there is no @xmath19-torsion , then it follows immediately that the cokernel of the first map is zero .",
    "in other words @xmath134 is surjective ; any cocycle @xmath129 can be lifted to a cocycle @xmath50 .",
    "if we are unluckily sabotaged by @xmath19-torsion , then we pick another prime and redo the calculation from scratch : it is enough to pick a prime that does not divide the order of the torsion subgroup of @xmath136 , so almost any prime will do .    in practice , we construct @xmath21 by taking the coefficients of @xmath130 in @xmath18 and replacing them with integers in the correct congruence class modulo  @xmath19 . the default choice is to choose coefficients close to zero .",
    "if @xmath40 then we are done ; otherwise it becomes necessary to do some repair work .",
    "certainly @xmath137 modulo  @xmath19 , so we can write @xmath138 for some @xmath139 . in the absence of @xmath19-torsion , we can then solve @xmath140 for @xmath141 , and then the required lift is @xmath142 .",
    "fortunately , this has not proved necessary in any of our examples .",
    "we expect that @xmath19-torsion is extremely rare in ` real ' data sets , since it is symptomatic of rather subtle topological phenomena . for instance , the simplest examples which exhibit 2-torsion are the nonorientable closed surfaces ( such as the projective plane and the klein bottle ) .",
    "given an integer cocycle @xmath50 , or indeed a real cocycle @xmath143 , we wish to find the ` smoothest ' real cocycle @xmath55 cohomologous to  @xmath21 .",
    "it turns out that what we want is the harmonic cocycle representing the cohomology class @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "we define smoothness .",
    "each of the spaces @xmath144 comes with a natural euclidean metric : @xmath145 a circle - valued function @xmath53 is ` smooth ' if its total variation across the edges of  @xmath10 is small .",
    "the terms @xmath146 capture the variation across individual edges ; therefore what we must minimize is @xmath147 .",
    "let @xmath143 .",
    "there is a unique solution @xmath59 to the least - squares minimization problem @xmath148 moreover , @xmath59 is characterized by the equation @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the adjoint of @xmath151 with respect to the inner products on @xmath152 .",
    "note that if @xmath153 then for any @xmath42 we have @xmath154 which implies that such an @xmath59 must be the unique minimizer . for existence ,",
    "note that @xmath155 certainly has a solution  @xmath43 if @xmath156 .",
    "but this is a standard fact in finite - dimensional linear algebra : @xmath157 for any real matrix  @xmath158 ; this follows from the singular value decomposition , for instance .    remark .",
    "it is customary to construct the laplacian @xmath159 .",
    "the twin equations @xmath160 and @xmath161 immediately imply ( and conversely , can be deduced from ) the single equation @xmath162 ; in other words @xmath59 is _",
    "harmonic_.      the least - squares problem in equation   can be solved using a standard algorithm such as lsqr  @xcite . by proposition  [ prop : real ] we can use the solution parameter  @xmath43 to define the circular coordinate @xmath53 on the vertices of  @xmath10 .",
    "this works because the original cocycle @xmath21 has integer coefficients .",
    "more generally , if @xmath59 is an arbitrary real cocycle such that @xmath60   \\in { \\mathop{\\rm im}}({\\operatorname{\\mathrm{h}}}^1(x ; { \\mathbb{z } } ) \\to { \\operatorname{\\mathrm{h}}}^1(x ; { \\mathbb{r}}))$ ] , it is a straightforward matter to integrate @xmath59 to a circle - valued function @xmath53 on the vertex set  @xmath163 .",
    "suppose that @xmath10 is connected ( if not , each connected component can be treated separately ) and pick a starting vertex  @xmath164 and assign  @xmath165 .",
    "one can use dijkstra s algorithm to find shortest paths to each remaining vertex from  @xmath164 .",

    "if a vertex @xmath169 is connected to @xmath164 by multiple paths then the different possible values of @xmath62 differ by an integer ; this is where we use the hypothesis that @xmath59 is cohomologous to an integer cocyle .",

    "we ran a development version of jplex to obtain explicit persistent cohomology cocycles .",
    "we expect to include the code in the next release of jplex .",
    "we used paige and saunders implementation of lsqr  @xcite for the least - squares problem in the harmonic smoothing step .",
    "timings were determined using matlab s built - in ` tic ' and ` toc ' commands , and are included for relative comparison against each other .",
    "we tested our methods on several synthetic data sets with known topology , ranging from the humble circle itself to a genus-2 surface ( ` double torus ' ) .",
    "most of the examples were embedded in @xmath170 or  @xmath171 , with the exception of a sample from a complex projective curve ( embedded in @xmath172 ) and a synthetic image - like data set ( embedded in @xmath173 ) .    in each case",
    "we selected vertices for the filtered simplicial complex : either the whole set , or a smaller well - distributed subset of ` landmarks ' selected by iterative furthest - point sampling .",
    "we then built a rips or witness complex , with maximum radius generally chosen to ensure around @xmath174 simplices in the complex .",
    "in most cases , we show the persistence diagram produced by the cocycle computation .",
    "the chosen value  @xmath175 is marked on the diagonal , with its upper - left quadrant indicated in green lines .",
    "the persistent cocycles available at that parameter value are precisely those contained in that quadrant .",
    "each of those cocycles then produces a circular coordinate .",
    "there are various figures associated with each example .",
    "most important are the correlation scatter plots : each scatter plot compares two circular coordinate functions .",
    "these may be functions produced by the computation ( ` inferred coordinates ' ) or known parameters .",
    "these scatter plots are drawn in the unit square , which is of course really a torus @xmath176 .",
    "when the original data are embedded in @xmath170 or  @xmath171 , we also display the circular coordinates directly on the data set , plotting each point in color according to its coordinate value interpreted on the standard hue - circle .",
    "this works less well in grayscale reproductions , of course .    finally , in certain cases",
    "we plot coordinate values against frequency , as a histogram .",
    "this distributional information can sometimes be useful in the absence of other information .",
    "when the goal is to infer the topology of a data set whose structure is unknown , we do not have any ` known parameters ' available to us .",
    "we can still construct correlation scatter plots between pairs of inferred coordinates , and the distributional histograms for each coordinate individually .",
    "we exhort the reader to view the following examples through the lens of the topological inference problem : what structures can be distinguished using scatter plots and histograms ( and persistence diagrams ) alone ?",
    "we begin with the circle itself , and its tautological circle - valued coordinate .",
    "we picked 400 points distributed along the unit circle .",
    "we added a uniform random variable from @xmath177 $ ] to each coordinate .",
    "a rips complex was constructed with maximal radius 0.5 , resulting in 23475 simplices .",
    "the computation of cohomology finished in 237 seconds .",
    "parametrizing at 0.4 yielded a single coordinate function , which very closely reproduces the tautological angle function .",
    "parametrizing at 0.14 yielded several possible cocycles .",
    "we selected one of those with low persistence ; this produced a parametrization which ` snags ' around a small gap in the data .",
    "see figure  [ fig : noisycircle ] .",

    "the high - persistence ( ` global ' ) coordinate correlates with the angle function with topological degree  1 .",
    "variation in that coordinate is uniformly distributed , as seen in the histogram .",
    "in contrast , the low - persistence ( ` local ' ) coordinate has a spiky distribution .",
    "another example with circle topology : see figure  [ fig : trefoil ] .",
    "we picked 400 points distributed along the @xmath178 torus knot on a torus with radii 2.0 and 1.0 .",
    "we jittered them by a uniform random variable from @xmath179 $ ] added to each coordinate .",
    "we generated a rips complex up to radius  1.0 , acquiring 36936 simplices .",
    "we computed persistent cohomology in 70 seconds .",
    "as expected , the inferred coordinate correlates strongly with the known parameter with topological degree  1 .",

    "each image was regarded as a vector in the euclidean space @xmath180 . from this data we built a witness complex with 50 landmark points and constructed a single circular coordinate .",
    "interpolating the resulting function linearly between the landmarks gave us coordinates for all the points in the family .",
    "see figure  [ fig : cube ] .",
    "the frequency distribution is comparatively smooth ( by which we mean that there are no large spikes in the histogram ) , which indicates that the coordinate does not have large static regions .",

    "see figure  [ fig : torus ] .",
    "we picked 400 points at random in the unit square , and then used a standard parametrization to map the points onto a torus with inner and outer radii 1.0 and 3.0 .",
    "these were subsequently jittered by adding a uniform random variable from @xmath179 $ ] to each coordinate .",
    "we constructed a rips complex with maximal radius @xmath185 , resulting in 61522 simplices .",
    "the corresponding cohomology was computed in 209 seconds .",
    "+    the two inferred coordinates in this ( fairly typical ) experimental run recover the original coordinates essentially perfectly : the first inferred coordinate correlates with the meridional coordinate with topological degree  @xmath186 , while the second inferred coordinate correlates with the longitudinal coordinate with degree  @xmath187 .    when the original coordinates are unavailable , the important figure is the inferred - versus - inferred scatter plot . in this case",
    "the scatter plot is fairly uniformly distributed over the entire coordinate square ( i.e.  torus ) . in other words ,",
    "the two coordinates are decorrelated .",
    "this is slightly truer ( and more clearly apparent in the scatter plot ) for the two original coordinates .",
    "contrast these with the corresponding scatter plots for a pair of circles ( conjoined or disjoint ) .",
    "see figure  [ fig : elliptic ] . for fun",
    ", we repeated the previous experiment with a torus abstractly defined as the zero set of a homogeneous cubic polynomial in three variables , interpreted as a complex projective curve .",
    "we picked 400 points at random on @xmath188 , subject to the cubic equation @xmath189 to interpret these as points in @xmath172 , we used the projectively invariant metric @xmath190 for all pairs @xmath191 . with this metric we built a rips complex with maximal radius 0.15 .",
    "the resulting complex had 44184 simplices , and the cohomology was computed in 56 seconds .",
    "we found two dominant coclasses that survived beyond radius  0.15 , and we computed our parametrizations at the 0.15 mark .",
    "the resulting correlation plot quite clearly exhibits the decorrelation which is characteristic of the torus .",
    "see figure  [ fig : doubletorus ] .",
    "we constructed a genus-2 surface by generating 1600 points on a torus with inner and outer radii 1.0 and 3.0 ; slicing off part of the data set by a plane at distance 3.7 from the axis of the torus , and reflecting the remaining points in that plane .",
    "the resulting data set has 3120 points . out of these , we pick 400 landmark points , and construct a witness complex with maximal radius 0.6 .",
    "the landmark set yields a covering radius @xmath192 and a complex with 70605 simplices .",
    "the computation took 748 seconds active computer time .",
    "we identified the four most significant cocycles .",
    "+    note that coordinates 1 and  4 are ` coupled ' in the sense that they are supported over the same subtorus of the double torus .",
    "the scatter plot shows that the two coordinates appear to be completely decorrelated except for a large mass concentrated at a single point .",
    "this mass corresponds to the other subtorus , on which coordinates 1 and  4 are essentially constant .",
    "a similar discussion holds for coordinates 2 and  3 .",
    "the uncoupled coordinate pairs ( 1,2 ) , ( 1,3 ) , ( 2,4 ) , ( 3,4 ) produce scatter plots reminiscent of two conjoined or disjoint circles .",
    "we are immensely grateful to dmitriy morozov : he has given us considerable assistance in implementing the algorithms in this paper .",
    "in particular we thank him for the persistent cocycle algorithm .    thanks also to jennifer kloke for sharing her analysis of a visual image data set ; this example did not make the present version of this paper . finally , we thank gunnar carlsson , for his support and encouragement as leader of the topological data analysis research group at stanford ; and robert ghrist , as leader of the darpa - funded project sensor topology and minimal planning ( stomp ) .      m.  belkin and p.  niyogi .",
