    "the potential of gravitationally bound structures in the universe , ranging in size from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters , is sourced by a composite mass distribution of dark matter , baryonic matter in gas form , and collapsed objects such as stars in galaxies and galaxies in clusters .",
    "the investigation of these mass distributions entails a number of questions : what is the shape of the distributions ?",
    "is it universal across ten magnitudes of mass and at all redshifts ?",
    "does it depend on cosmology or on the merger history of the individual halos ?",
    "since the dominant component of relaxed structures is dark matter , much focus has been aimed at dark matter - only halos .",
    "there is little theoretical understanding of the distribution of matter in a dark matter halo .",
    "the main developments have been found through numerical simulations of the formation of structure in the universe within a given cosmological model .",
    "advances have been achieved through the improvement of numerical codes as well as the increase of raw computing power on one hand and a more refined understanding of which questions that need to be answered on the other .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental idea that has come out of the numerical approach is that relaxed halos are ( nearly ) universal in many respects , including the distribution of matter @xcite and the dynamical structure @xcite .",
    "however , the simulations have not been able to reach agreement about the exact behavior of the profiles in the innermost regions , where the limited force resolution of simulations sets a lower limit to the radial range that can be probed .",
    "various authors claim that the logarithmic slope of the density profile reaches a value between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , perhaps dependent on mass or merger history , and there is also discussion whether the inner slope is actually universal or not @xcite .",
    "a further complication arises when the simulations are compared with observations since the gravitational potential of the baryonic component , which is very time consuming to model in the simulations , can not be neglected in the center .",
    "this complication can in principle both change the slope of the dark matter profile as well as alter the total mass profile @xcite .",
    "theoretical efforts are hampered by the fact that , even under the strongest simplifying assumptions , there are not enough constraints to obtain unique solutions to the collisionless boltzmann equation @xcite which governs a dark matter structure .",
    "instead , one can take phenomenological input from numerical simulations such as the density profile itself , the pseudo - phase space density @xcite , or the density slope - velocity anisotropy relation ( from which @xcite predict an inner slope of @xmath2 ) , and implement this into a jeans equation analysis to predict the consequences of the ` inspired guess ' ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "alternatively one can attempt to model the formation history of the halo including major mergers and steady accretion ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "while these approaches typically yield results in rough agreement with simulations , the modeling can also explore the physical connection between the static and dynamic properties of the halo as well as offer constrained extrapolations which are not accessible in simulations .",
    "observationally , there is a strong discrepancy between the numerical results and the inferred mass distributions in dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies , which are much shallower than predicted , the so - called cusp / core - problem ( see , e.g. , ) . at the opposite end of the mass spectrum , galaxy clusters are typically found to be in rough agreement with the cuspy numerical simulations , but with even greater scatter for the inferred inner slope .",
    "there is also significant discussion about the type of model and number of parameters that are necessary in order to obtain an acceptable description of the data .",
    "one common method is based on mass modeling through weak or strong gravitational lensing , which can yield results which are in good agreement with numerical simulations , but also profiles that are significantly shallower @xcite .",
    "another method is based on x - ray observations of the intracluster medium ( icm ) which is supported against gravitational collapse by its own pressure .",
    "again , authors find a range of inner slopes @xcite .",
    "for both lensing and x - ray studies most authors focus on only one or a few clusters , which of course makes it more difficult to assess the universality of the profiles on an observational foundation .    in the present work",
    "we take a sample of 11 highly relaxed clusters and use the measurements of the x - ray emitting gas to infer model - independent mass profiles .",
    "we then compare with a number of different models that have been applied as mass profiles in the literature , focusing on three key questions : which parameterized model is the most successful ? how many free parameters are needed to describe the data adequately ?",
    "is there evidence for a universal inner slope / shape - type parameter ?",
    "we answer these questions using a detailed statistical analysis based on bayesian inference where we use the bayesian evidence ( or marginal likelihood ) to make judgments about which model is preferred by the data .",
    "most models that are used for modeling the mass distribution in halos have been proposed or introduced as fitting formulae applied to the halos found in the numerical simulations . hence these models are not theoretically well - founded but rather form a basis on which the predictions of numerical simulations can be compared with observations .",
    "almost all of these models have two free parameters which determine the mass scale and the spatial extent of the halo , and these two parameters are specific to each halo .",
    "some models have one or more additional parameters which determines the shape of the profile , and which may or may not be universal . here",
    "we consider a number of two- and three - parameter models .",

    "the inner power - law slope is @xmath28 and the outer slope is @xmath29 , while the width of the transition region is controlled by @xmath30 .",
    "we consider four such two - parameter profiles : the nfw @xcite , the dehnen - mclaughlin @xcite , the hernquist , and the moore profile @xcite .",
    "the properties of these models are summarized in table [ tb : models ] .",
    "we also consider three three - parameter models : two are simply generalized nfw profiles where , in the first case , we allow the inner slope @xmath28 to vary .",
    "the motivation for this slopenfw model was already apparent from the introduction .",
    "the second case , transnfw , is also a generalization of the nfw where now the transition parameter @xmath30 is free .",
    "such a profile can mimic a steeper inner slope by pushing the inner power law behavior closer to the center .",
    "the third profile is the srsic ( or einasto ) profile @xcite , @xmath31\\right),\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath32 determines the shape of the profile . for @xmath33 the de vaucouleurs law describing the surface brightness of elliptical galaxies",
    "is recovered .",
    "the shape parameter is sometimes given as @xmath34 .",
    "recently , the srsic profile has been claimed to provide a better fit than the nfw to milky way - sized haloes formed in numerical simulations , and , interestingly , with a shape parameter that varies significantly from halo to halo @xcite .",
    "we map the scale radius @xmath27 and scale densities @xmath35 or @xmath26 of each model to the model - independent parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which are the radius at which the slope of the density profile is @xmath38 and the density at that radius , respectively .",
    "this mapping makes comparison of the models easier and enables identical priors to be used in the statistical analysis in all models .",
    "we revisit the sample of 11 highly relaxed , low redshift ( @xmath39 ) galaxy clusters observed with _ xmm - newton _ which we already used in @xcite to measure the dark matter velocity anisotropy profile for the first time ( see also ) .",
    "the members of this sample were selected to appear close to round on the sky and not have strong features in the temperature and density profiles .",
    "the spectral analysis and deprojection of the x - ray data was carried out in and .",
    "the deprojection method was non - parametric , i.e.  without any parametric modeling of the radial temperature or density profiles .",
    "the outcome , and the starting point for the present analysis , was estimates of the icm temperature @xmath40 and electron number density @xmath41 with associated uncertainties in six or seven radial bins , for each of the clusters .",
    "assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , the icm gas traces the gravitational potential according to @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mean molecular weight of the icm .",
    "almost all of the cluster mass resides in dark matter and the icm , and therefore the dark matter mass distribution can be determined through @xmath44 .",
    "the icm mass profile is given straight - forwardly by the density @xmath45 .",
    "we calculate @xmath46 of each radial bin through a monte carlo ( mc ) analysis in order to propagate uncertainties accurately . in detail , the prescription for each mc realization is as follows : in each bin @xmath47 the best estimates of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are added to random numbers drawn from gaussian distributions representative of the uncertainties @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in order to apply equation",
    ", we estimate the logarithmic derivative of , e.g. , @xmath50 at the bin - radius @xmath51 by the slope of the unique parabola that passes through @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . in this way we can calculate the total mass interior to @xmath51 for that data realization .",
    "we subtract the gas mass , estimated through a five - point newton - cotes integration formula applied to the same realization of the density data , and we arrive at the dark matter mass @xmath55 .",
    "we impose a number of checks to determine if the derived data realization is physically sensible : the icm temperature and density must be greater than zero in all bins , the total mass profile must be increasing with radius , and the dark matter mass profile and derived density profile must also be everywhere positive .",
    "if these conditions are not met the entire realization is discarded .",
    "this process is repeated until @xmath56 realizations have been accepted . from these",
    "the sample mean of @xmath57 in each bin is determined , as well as the sample covariance matrix with elements @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of monte carlo realizations .",
    "even though we sample the icm temperature and density in each bin independently , the covariance matrix is not diagonal since the derivatives and physical consistency checks induce bin - to - bin correlations in the accepted sample .",
    "we use the mean and covariance of @xmath60 rather than @xmath61 since , by inspection , the former is closer to being gaussian distributed .",
    "we take a bayesian approach to the statistical analysis and the usual starting point is the likelihood function , which we calculate in the following manner .",
    "it requires less manipulation of the data to calculate the mass profile from the observations than to calculate the density profile .",
    "therefore we integrate the density profile analytically or numerically for each model to obtain the mass distribution and compare with the data in mass space , not density space .",
    "further , as mentioned above , we have found in the mc analysis that the mass samplings in each bin are close to being log - normally distributed .",
    "therefore we construct the likelihood @xmath62 from the @xmath63 function , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the model mass profile at the radial centre @xmath51 of bin @xmath47 , and @xmath57 and @xmath66 are determined by the mc analysis .",
    "the main goal is to decide which model is the better representation of the data .",
    "we do this by calculating the bayesian evidence of each model , which is a quantitative measure of the agreement between model and data @xcite .",
    "first we calculate the likelihoods of each model on a grid in the parameter space @xmath67 .",
    "next , we construct the posterior probability distribution by combining the likelihood function with a prior probability distribution @xmath68 resembling our knowledge of @xmath69 and @xmath70 before taking the data into account .",
    "we discuss the choice of prior below .",
    "we then integrate the posterior to obtain the bayesian evidence , @xmath71 which is essentially the weighted average of the likelihood over the prior volume .",
    "the evidence of a model , given the data and a prior , quantifies how well that model explains the data .",
    "it is important to stress that the comparison is made over all of the prior volume , not just at the best fitting set of parameters . when comparing models the bayes factor @xmath72 shows how much more ( or less ) probable model 1 is than model 2 , in light of the data .",
    "traditionally , this is gauged on jeffrey s scale where a bayes factor of @xmath73 is labeled ` inconclusive ' evidence for model 1 over model 2 while ` weak ' , ` moderate ' , and ` strong ' evidence corresponds to @xmath74 values @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "we choose priors which are constant in the logarithms of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the flat logarithmic prior is the uninformative prior for scaling parameters @xcite since it reflects ignorance about the magnitude of the parameter .",
    "however we restrict the range of the priors , so that we end up with top - hat priors in @xmath69 and @xmath70 . as a reference point",
    "we first assume a top - hat prior relative to the best estimate of @xmath78 as determined in the mc analysis .",
    "( the scale radius @xmath78 is defined as the radius within which the mean density is @xmath79 times the critical density of the universe . )",
    "the top - hat prior in @xmath69 ranges from @xmath80 magnitudes below @xmath78 to 0.5 above .",
    "the basic idea behind this prior is that the transition or ` roll ' of a model should occur close to @xmath78 , as it does in haloes in numerical simulations , and also to prevent the model from behaving as a simple power - law by pushing the transition from the inner to the outer power law far away from the range of the data .",
    "we emphasize that this is still a conservative prior , as current simulations typically resolve 23 radial magnitudes with @xmath36 located about one order of magnitude below the virial radius @xcite .",
    "the prior in @xmath37 is also a top - hat in the logarithm and a range of @xmath81@xmath82kg@xmath83m@xmath84 , which in practice means that the likelihood is vanishingly small at the boundaries of the prior .",

    "a positive bayes factor indicates that the nfw model is preferred .",
    "this does not imply any bias on the nfw since any two models can be compared by subtracting the bayes factors we give for them from one another .",
    "we find that , individually , the clusters yield strong constraints only against the moore model , while the evidences for or against the d&m and hernquist models are either weak or inconclusive on jeffrey s scale .",
    "if instead we consider the cumulative bayes factor summed over the full sample , the nfw is found to be the preferred model overall , i.e. , as a universal two - parameter profile our sample favors the nfw model .",
    "the hernquist profile and the d&m profile are weakly and moderately disfavored , respectively , with cumulative bayes factors of 2.4 and 3.6 while the moore profile is convincingly ruled out with a factor of 51 .",
    "the weak constraint on the hernquist profile is not surprising as data extending out to the virial radius would likely be needed to properly distinguish this model from the nfw .    in table",
    "[ tb : priors ] we present the effects of varying the priors .",
    "the evidence against the d&m profile increases to the level of strong when we limit the range of the prior in @xmath69 to the smaller interval @xmath85 , while the bayes factor is reduced slightly on the larger range @xmath86 .",
    "the evidence also becomes strong if we choose top - hat priors in @xmath87 instead of the logarithmic priors .",
    "finally , the d&m model is disfavored slightly more if we apply a ` soft ' gaussian prior in @xmath69 .",
    "the bayes factor for the hernquist model is robust under the same variations , while the moore profile is very strongly ruled out in all cases .",
    "we conclude that our two - parameter model selection results are stable against variation amongst reasonable choices of priors , which means that the data are of sufficient quality to make robust conclusions .",
    "a more interesting issue to consider than the priors is that the preference for the nfw profile over the hernquist and d&m profiles is somewhat susceptible to ` jackknife ' resampling : if we recompute the cumulative bayes factor eleven times systematically leaving a single cluster out each time , there are a few cases where the strength of the evidence is reduced to inconclusive but also cases where it is increased to strong ( against the d&m ) .",
    "this is largely due to the fact that our data sample is somewhat inhomogeneous in terms of the relative statistical uncertainty on the mass profile .",
    "for example , a comparison of the error bars of mkw9 with those of a1795 or srsic 159 - 3 ( see figure [ fi : mass ] ) immediately shows that the former is much less constraining than the latter two .",
    "this means that our sample is a mixture of strongly and weakly constraining clusters and this is reflected in figure [ fi : chart ] where the contributions from individual clusters clearly varies .",
    "there appears to be a trend that the clusters a262 , ngc533 , and a496 , which are the lowest redshift and some of the least massive in our sample , stand out by preferring the d&m and the moore profile .",
    "however , such trends are just as likely spurious selection effects caused by the relatively small sample but could be investigated with a larger sample .",
    "the d&m profile can easily be preferred by clusters that also prefer the moore profile since , by extending the transition region , the d&m profile can push the inner asymptotic power law well inside the radial range of the data .",
    "finally we compare with a standard goodness  of  fit test : the minimum @xmath63 values for the models support our more detailed analysis : for a total of 53 degrees of freedom we get minimum @xmath63 s of 81 for the nfw , 93 for the d&m , 82 for the hernquist , and 190 for the moore profile .",
    "major contributions to these @xmath63 values come from the two clusters mkw3s with @xmath88 and a4059 with @xmath89 for the nfw model and similar or larger values for the other models .",
    "the corresponding @xmath90-values imply that the d&m @xmath63 is about 20 times less likely to have occurred by chance ( if the d&m model is correct ) than the nfw model is ( if the nfw model is correct ) .",
    "compare this with the bayesian odds that the nfw is @xmath91 times more probable than the d&m .",
    "note that the actual best - fits are slightly smaller since we evaluate the @xmath63 on a grid instead of minimizing it with a dedicated search .",
    "the @xmath63 values show that , also in terms of goodness ",
    "o - f - fit , our sample is rather inhomogeneous .",
    "the rather poor total fit should not be judged too harshly since the halos in numerical simulations also show halo  to  halo scatter , which is not accounted for by the fitting profiles .",

    "the comparison is slightly more involved since there is the freedom of an additional parameter to take into account .",
    "this naturally yields a lower value of the evidence if the extra parameter does not provide a better description of the data , or , more specifically , the third parameter must improve the fit over a significant volume of parameter space in order to be preferred over the nfw .",
    "it is important to stress that there is no assumption about the third parameter being universal . on the contrary",
    ", we ask whether the data require the additional freedom of an extra parameter which is determined individually for each cluster .",
    "the model comparison proceeds as before : we calculate the evidence for each of the three - parameter models with the same priors in @xmath69 and @xmath70 as in the fiducial two - parameter analysis for all models . for the slopenfw",
    "we choose a top - hat prior for @xmath28 which ranges from 0 to 1.75 , i.e.  from a cored profile to a profile slightly steeper than the moore profile .",
    "we do not want to go all the way to @xmath38 since @xmath36 tends to zero and eventually becomes undefined as @xmath28 approaches @xmath38 .",
    "for the transnfw , we choose a logarithmic prior with @xmath30 in the range @xmath92 which allows this profile to mimic a steeper inner profile by pushing the asymptotic inner power law inside the radial range of the data . finally , we take a logarithmic prior for @xmath32 in the range ( 2,15 ) for the srsic model , motivated by numerical simulations which have best fits srsic profiles with @xmath32=59 .",
    "the logarithmic prior has the advantage that it is invariant whether one prefers @xmath32 or @xmath93 as the parameterization .",
    "the resulting bayes factors relative to the nfw are given in table [ tb : bayes3 ] and summarized in the chart in figure [ fi : chart ] .",
    "the individual clusters provide only weak evidence for or against any of the models .",
    "based on the whole sample , the model selection is inconclusive for the transnfw and srsic models but there is ` moderate ' evidence for the slopenfw model over the nfw with a bayes factor of @xmath94 .",
    "this corresponds to odds of 13 to 1 in favor of the slopenfw model and shows that , overall , the slopenfw has the highest evidence @xmath95 of all models considered .",
    "hence the data show a moderate need for a free inner slope despite the penalty against the extra freedom built into the bayesian analysis .",
    "it must be mentioned that most of the discriminatory power is carried by a few clusters such as ngc533 , a4059 , and a1795 and removal of any of these clusters from the sample would change the bayes factor significantly . therefore we caution that the moderate preference for the slopenfw model is somewhat susceptible to selection effects since , as noted above , the constraints from individual clusters vary in quality .",
    "we also find some sensitivity to the choice of prior : if the upper bound of @xmath28 is extended from 1.75 up to 1.9 , the bayes factor for the slopenfw model changes to @xmath96 , while if it is set to the moore profile at @xmath80 the bayes factor becomes @xmath97 .",
    "if the lower bound of @xmath28 is increased to @xmath98 , the bayes factor remains relatively unchanged at @xmath99 .",
    "while we believe that the fiducial priors used above are reasonable descriptions of the ` state of knowledge ' based on numerical simulations , the sensitivity to the choice of prior indicates that the data do not necessarily confine the posterior to a sufficiently small region of the prior volume to provide unambiguous conclusions .",

    "we calculate 95% credible intervals for both the individual and the joint posterior . however , we know from the previous analysis that each three - parameter model is preferred by some clusters but not by others",
    ". therefore we also use the method of hyper - parameters @xcite which allows the contribution from individual data - sets to the joint posterior to be weighted .",

    "the upshot of all this is that clusters that are not described well by the model do not constrain the parameters as strongly as clusters that are well described .",
    "the price to pay is that the effective sample size is reduced which , all other things being equal , will lead to wider and more conservative credible intervals .",

    "we believe the hyper - parameters yields the more trustworthy results in the case at hand , while on the other hand we acknowledge that they are not very constraining .",
    "an inspection of the contribution from individual clusters reveals some issues : it is clear that for each model a number of clusters provide very little information about the third parameter , i.e.  the model describes the mass profile almost equally well regardless of the third parameter value .",
    "this is actually expected , given the varying size of the bayes factors in table [ tb : bayes3 ] .",
    "there are also a few cases , particularly for the transnfw model , where the posterior peaks very close to or on the bounds of the prior . in such cases the results ,",
    "e.g.  the individual credible intervals , are of course very prior - dependent which again indicates that the data are not very discriminatory with respect to the prior . on the other hand , rather drastic priors or small sub - samples",
    "must be used in order to significantly affect the credible intervals of the joint posterior , especially for the hyper - parameters method .     for the redshifts of each cluster .",
    "]    figure [ fi : zdep ] shows the individual clusters constraints on @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath32 . as could be expected given the varying nature of our results , there is perhaps the slightest of hints of a redshift  dependence in the constraints but our sample size does not allow us to probe such an issue in detail .",
    "it should again be noted that any hint of a redshift  dependence could actually be caused by a mass  dependence instead , since the two lowest redshift clusters in our sample are also the least massive .",
    "a different picture emerges when we consider the overlap of the individual clusters credible intervals for the slopenfw model .",
    "for example , no value of @xmath28 is contained in all 11 95% credible intervals , and only the very short range @xmath109 is contained in all but two intervals .",

    "in fact , we believe it is a reasonable statement that the success of the slopenfw model is precisely due to the very different preferred values of @xmath28 from cluster to cluster .",
    "this puts a strong question mark against the idea of universal third parameter .",
    "we conclude that there is moderate evidence for the slopenfw model to be preferred over the simple nfw , while the transnfw and srsic models do not stand out against the two - parameter nfw profile .",
    "if the inner slope of the slopenfw model is universal , we constrain it to be close to @xmath0 but preferably slightly steeper .",
    "however , the spread of the individual clusters preferred ranges suggests that the inner slope is not universal .",
    "we also comment that the method of hyper - parameters method could in principle be extended to the model selection analysis . as a matter of fact , since the slopenfw ` contains ' both the nfw and the moore models as subsets , we can derive the corresponding bayes factor for the moore profile which is only 10 .",
    "this is of course a drastic reduction numerically but it does not alter the conclusion and anyway corresponds to rather convincing odds of about @xmath111 .",
    "so far we have discussed the interpretation of our results with respect to the statistical evidence",
    ". however , a number of biases , or systematic uncertainties , can be thought of that may affect our results .",
    "loosely , these can be grouped into biases that affect both the individual cluster mass modeling and the combined analysis , and selection effects that only influence the latter .",
    "the analysis rests on the ability to produce deprojected temperature and density profiles with uncertainties that correctly mirror the uncertainties in the spectral analysis of the x - ray data .",
    "this has been discussed extensively in .",
    "the basic assumption in determining the mass distribution of a galaxy cluster is that the cluster is relaxed , and obeys the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the additional pressure associated with turbulence and bulk motion in the icm yields an underestimate of the mass in the region of @xmath112% with the larger values corresponding to large radii , @xmath113 and greater .",
    "we do not expect this bias to exceed 10% in the present case since we do not model further out than to @xmath114 . on the other hand ,",
    "the same numerical simulations indicate that if the turbulent pressure is accounted for , an accurate mass reconstruction is possible .",
    "this point demonstrates that deviations from spherical symmetry are not a major concern in the error budget .",
    "a related question is whether the parameterized profiles should be tested against the total mass distribution or the dark matter mass profile only .",
    "while the predictions of numerical simulations are founded in dark matter - only simulations , it is not clear how much a simulated dark matter - only mass profile is modified by the presence of baryons .",
    "observationally , the icm contributes about @xmath115% of the total density in a cluster , again increasing with radius in the range of interest here , so formally there is a difference between the total and the dark matter profile s radial dependence . to test the impact of this , we have rerun the statistical analyses described above without subtracting the icm mass from the mass estimate of equation .",
    "we find only minor differences : for the two - parameter models , the total bayes factors relative to the nfw profile , assuming the fiducial prior as in table [ tb : bayes2 ] , are 2.8 ( d&m ) , 2.7 ( hernquist ) , and 54 ( moore ) , i.e.  there is no significant change in the interpretation of the results .",
    "for the three - parameter models , the total bayes factors become @xmath97 ( slopenfw ) , @xmath116 ( transnfw ) , and @xmath117 ( srsic ) , which are in good agreement with the results in table [ tb : bayes3 ] .",
    "finally , the constraints on the third parameters for the three - parameter models are unchanged .",
    "the fact that our results are stable whether we test the mass models against the total or dark matter - only mass profiles allows us to gauge how important the mass bias caused by turbulent pressure is .",
    "the point is that the turbulent pressure is expected to contribute the same amount ( or less ) to the total mass estimate as the icm mass : both contributions are at the @xmath115% level and radially increasing , and at the maximum radius we consider @xmath114 the gas fraction ( @xmath118 ) is likely larger than the pressure bias . since our results are the same whether we account for the icm mass or not , we conclude that the systematic uncertainty is likely much smaller than the statistical uncertainty .",
    "( red , full lines ) which are derived within the radial range of the data , and @xmath119 ( blue , dot - dashed ) which is based on an nfw model - dependent extrapolation to @xmath120 .",
    "the dashed lines show the mean relations for the two values of @xmath121 from the n - body simulations of @xcite , based on the wmap5 cosmology .",
    "the relations are @xmath122 and @xmath123 . given the low redshift of our sample , we have not made any correction for a redshift evolution of @xmath124 . ]",
    "an important consequence of the ` bottom - up ' scenario of structure formation is that smaller halos are denser in the center , since they formed earlier when the density of the universe was higher .",
    "this effect is seen in numerical simulations and it can be expressed as a relation between the halo mass and the concentration parameter .",
    "the concentration parameter is defined for a given overdensity as @xmath125 ( often @xmath27 is used instead of @xmath36 but for the nfw this is unimportant )",
    ". simulations usually consider the mass  concentration relation at the virial radius @xmath120 , but we can only reach that radius by model - dependent extrapolation . therefore , in figure [ fi : mc ] , we show the mass  concentration relation of our sample calculated within the nfw model at both @xmath78 and extrapolated to @xmath120 .",
    "we suggest that authors provide relations at both of these @xmath121 s as they complement each other in physical significance and observational accessibility .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fi : mc ] , our sample is not ideally suited to derive a relation from given that six sample members cluster at almost identical values of @xmath126 .",
    "instead we compare with the mass  concentration relation of the simulations presented in @xcite , which are in reasonable agreement with our sample except for the low mass ngc533 .",
    "we emphasize that the orientation of the uncertainty ellipses is related only to the parameter degeneracies present in the combination of model and mass profile data and has nothing to do with the slope of the mass  concentration relation .",
    "the agreement between our observed mass  concentration relation and the predictions of numerical simulations resembles the recent x - ray analysis of @xcite , but stands out from the significant discrepancy of the lensing study in @xcite .",
    "we have conducted a careful statistical analysis of the constraints on mass distribution models of galaxy clusters which can be derived from x - ray observations .",
    "we find that the nfw model is the preferred two - parameter model and that the moore model is decisively ruled out .",
    "there is moderate evidence that the data require an additional free parameter that alters the shape of the mass profile , and the best choice is a model similar to the nfw but with a freely varying inner slope .",
    "if we assume this slope to be universal , we can constrain it to be close to or slightly steeper than the nfw , but our data suggest that the shape parameter must be determined individually .    significantly , the clusters in our sample prefer very different values for the inner slope , some prefer flat cores while others prefer steep cusps .",
    "the shape - parameters of the other two three - parameter models we consider , the srsic and transnfw , also show considerable scatter across our sample .",
    "we conclude that there is a strong indication in our data that the mass profile is not universal but suffers considerable halo - to - halo scatter",
    ". the limited size of our sample means that we can not assess whether this is in disagreement with the results of numerical simulations .",
    "of course , we can force universality of the inner slope , in which case we find that it is preferred to be slightly steeper than the nfw value of @xmath0 . however , when the goodness  of  fit of each cluster is taken into account using the method of bayesian hyper - parameters , the credible interval becomes significantly larger , partly because of the smaller effective sample size , but also because of the lack of universality .",
    "this analysis stands out from the numerous observational results that claim significant discrepancies from simulations based on only one or a few observed clusters .",
    "we acknowledge that our sample size is still limited , but it allows us to discuss the issue of universality .",
    "given that halos in numerical simulations which include baryons are still not readily mass produced with sufficient resolution , which makes the question of halo to halo scatter difficult to assess , it is not possible to decide if the strong indication of a non - universal model that we see is at odds with the numerical predictions .",
    "our results are largely insensitive to whether we compare the models with the dark matter mass profile or the total mass profile , and so we can not judge whether one type of model is more appropriate for the dark matter halo or the total gravitational potential of a halo .",
    "there are two reasons for this : firstly , the uncertainties of primarily the icm temperature profiles are too large , and secondly , the angular resolution in the center is not good enough .",
    "of course the icm is rather smoothly distributed and very good statistics would be needed for a model to fit either the total or dark matter distribution significantly better . for nine of the 11 clusters of our sample we readily found 2mass @xcite cd or bcg galaxies very close to the x - ray center but including these in the mass budget does not make a difference , unless we assumed extreme mass - to - light ratios .",
    "this is again due to the limited angular resolution of the observations which implies that a large amount of dark matter is contained even within the radial center of the innermost bin .",
    "the robustness of our results whether we use the dark matter or total mass profile gives us reasonable confidence that deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium in the icm are not a major problem .",
    "such a systematic uncertainty would yield a bias of at most 1015% according to numerical simulations , which is similar to the difference between the total and dark matter mass profiles .",
