    "it is widely believed that self - gravitating accretion discs can form around supermassive black holes ( sbh ) in agns .",
    "theoretical models show that the agn accretion discs must become self - gravitating if they extend beyond a fraction of a parsec away from a central black hole ( paczynski 1978 , kolykhalov and sunyaev 1980 , schlosman and begelman 1987 , kumar 1999 , jure 1999 , goodman 2003 ) .",
    "self - gravitating discs are unstable to fragmentation on a dynamical timescale ; self - gravity of agn accretion discs is a major issue in understanding how gas is delivered to the central black hole .",
    "it is likely that star formation will occur in the outer parts of an agn accretion disc ( kolykhalov and sunyaev 1980 , schlosman and begelman 1987 ) .",
    "there are two lines of observational evidence that a starburst within sbh s radius of influence may be a common phenomenon :    \\(i ) levin and beloborodov ( lb , 2003 ) , using pre - existing data , have identified a disc of young massive stars which are moving clockwise in the gravitational potential of sgra * , the sbh at the center of the galaxy . they have argued that the stars were born in a dense accretion disc which existed several million years ago in the galactic center .",
    "the presence of the disc was later confirmed by genzel et .",
    "( 2003 ) and paumard et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who have used updated data sets ; these authors also found a second counter - clockwise disc of young massive stars .",
    "for the past few years , an alternative possibility for the origin of the young stars was considered on equal footing with lb s proposal . in the alternative scenario ( gerhard 2001 , hansen and milosavljevic 2003 ) ,",
    "the stars were born tens of parsecs from sgra * and were originally members of a massive star cluster .",
    "this cluster then spiraled in towards sgra * due to dynamical friction with an inner bulge , and deposited the stars near sgra*. however , this scenario is now disfavored due to two recent observations : ( a ) in the cluster scenario one expects many young low - mass stars to also be present in the galactic center and for them to produce copious amounts of x - ray emission from their coronae .",
    "however , chandra observations show that the galactic center is a relatively weak x - ray emitter , and thus the presence of a multitude of low - mass stars is ruled out ( nayakshin and sunyaev , 2005 ) ; ( b ) paumard et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find no early - type stars outside of the central half - parsec , which again strongly argues against the in - spiraling cluster scenario .",
    "therefore , most likely the young stellar disc formed in situ as result of fragmentation of a gaseous disc , as was argued by lb .",
    "\\(ii ) bender et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have used hst to identify a compact disc of a - stars which is located deep in the gravitational potential of a sbh in the nucleus of m31 .",
    "the stars are likely much younger than the sbh ( this is true unless one assumes that the sbh is older than @xmath0 years ) , and the strong tidal barrier makes it unlikely that the disc is a remnant of a tidally disrupted star cluster since any cluster would get disrupted at a larger distance from the sbh ( nayakshin , 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , the disc of a - stars is most likely the remnant of a gaseous accretion disc which existed in m31 about a hundred million years ago",
    ".    star formation in an sbh radius of influence may be connected to supporting the high accretion of some agns ( thompson et al .",
    "2005 ) and at the same time may help explain low luminocity of others ( tan and blackman 2005 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the fragmenting disc is strongly affected by the feedback energy input from the starburst .",
    "collin and zahn ( 1999 ) have conjectured that the feedback from this star formation will prevent the accretion disc from becoming strongly self - gravitating . however , goodman ( 2003 ) has used general energy arguments to show that the feedback from star formation is insufficient to prevent an agn disc with the near - eddington accretion rate from becoming strongly self - gravitating at a distance of @xmath1@xmath2 scwartzschild radii from the central black hole ( about @xmath3pc for our galactic center ) .",
    "this is distinct from the case of galactic gas discs , for which there is evidence that the feedback from star formation protects them from their self - gravity .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the physics of the self - gravitating disc and make a semi - analytical estimate of the possible mass range of stars formed in such discs ( sections 2 and 3 ) .",
    "our principal conclusion is that the stars can be very massive , up to hundreds of solar masses .",
    "this conclusion is in qualitative agreement with two recent independent observations : nayakshin and sunyaev ( 2005 ) and paumard et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have shown that the young stars in the gc must were produced in a starburst with the top - heavy imf strongly favoring massive stars . in section 4",
    "we specialize to the case of sgra * discs and show that the mass and the column density distribution of the marginally fragmenting disc are consistent with those of the currently observed stellar discs .",
    "we also address the puzzle of the several the young stars in the central arc - second ( the s - stars ) .",
    "their orbits present a problem for the disc - starburst picture .",
    "their extreme proximity to sgra * , eccentric orbits , and random inclinations exclude the possibility that they were born from the gaseous disc at their current location .",
    "we argue that instead they were born in a disc at a larger distance from sgra * , but then migrated inwards due to gravitational interaction with the disc .",
    "their eccentricity and inclination angles were randomized by relatively fast resonant relaxation , a process discovered by rauch and tremaine in 1996 .    in section 5",
    ", we consider a self - gravitating agn accretion disc which is continuously supplied by gas on a timescale greater than the lifetime of massive stars .",
    "some of the black - hole remnants of the stars become embedded in the disc and and migrate inward on the timescale of @xmath4 years .",
    "the merger of the migrating black hole with the central black hole will produce gravitational waves .",
    "we show that for a broad range of agn accretion rates the final inspiral is unaffected by gas drag , and therefore the gravitational - wave signal should be detectable by lisa .",
    "the rate of these mergers is uncertain , but if even a fraction of a percent of the disc mass is converted into black holes which later merge with the central black hole , then lisa should detect monthly a signal from such a merger .",
    "the final inspiral may occur close to the equatorial plane of the central supermassive hole and is likely to follow a quasi - circular orbit , which would make the gravitational - wave signal distinct from those in other astrophysical merger scenarios .",
    "if the disc - born black hole is sufficiently massive , it will disrupt accretion flow in the disc during the final year of its inspiral , thus making an optical counterpart to the gravitational - wave signal .",
    "the importance of self - gravitating accretion discs in astrophysics has long been understood ( paczynski 1978 , lin and pringle 1987 ) .",
    "it was conjectured that the turbulence generated by the gravitational ( toomre ) instability may act as a source of viscosity in the disc .",
    "this viscosity would both drive accretion and keep the disc hot ; the latter would act as a negative feedback for the toomre instability and would keep the disc only marginally unstable .",
    "recently , there has been big progress in our understanding of the self - gravitating discs , due to a range of new and sophisticated numerical simulations ( gammie 2001 , mayer et .",
    "2002 , rice et .",
    "2003 ) . in our analysis",
    ", we shall rely extensively on these numerical results .",
    "consider an accretion disc which is supplied by a gas infall .",
    "this situation may arise when a merger or some other major event in a galaxy delivers gas to the proximity of a supermassive black hole residing in the galactic bulge .",
    "let @xmath5 be the surface density of the disc .",
    "we follow the evolution of the disc as @xmath6 gradually increases due to the infall .",
    "we begin by assuming that initially there is no viscosity mechanism , like magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) , to transport the angular momentum and keep the disc hot .",
    "this assumption is valid when the ionization fraction of the gas in the disc is low , i.e.  when the gas is far enough from a central source ( about a thousand schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole )",
    ". we also , for the time being , neglect irradiation from the central source ; this may be a good assumption if a disrupted molecular cloud forms a disc but the accretion onto the hole has not yet begun .",
    "as will be discussed below , irradiation is important for some regions in the agn discs we are considering .",
    "however , as shown in the following subsection , inclusion of irradiation or other source of heating will only strengthen the case for formation of massive stars .",
    "we assume , therefore , that the forming disc cools until it becomes self - gravitating ; this happens when @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the isothermal speed of sound at the mid - plane of the disc , and @xmath9 is the angular velocity of the disc .",
    "numerical simulations show that once the disc becomes self - gravitating , turbulence and shocks develop ; they transport angular momentum and provide heating which compensates the cooling of the disc ( gammie 2001 ) .",
    "we thus assume , in agreement with the simulations , that when the disc exists , it is marginally self - gravitating , i.e.   @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath11 and @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the temperature in the mid - plane of the disc , @xmath14 is the proton mass , and @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the one - sided flux from the disc surface is given by the modified stephan - boltzmann law :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the effective temperature .",
    "it is related to the mid - plane temperature by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the optical depth of the disc ; here @xmath20 is the opacity of the disc .",
    "the function @xmath21 for an optically thin disc , and @xmath22 for an optically thick disc .",
    "we combine these two cases in our model by taking @xmath23 we have used eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) in the last step of eq .",
    "( [ trelation ] ) .",
    "the flux from the disc is powered by the accretion energy : @xmath24 here @xmath25 parametrizes viscous dissipation due to self - gravity ( gammie 2001 ) ; we have used eq .",
    "( [ c_s ] ) in the last step . using eqs ( [ flux1 ] ) , ( [ flux2 ] ) , and ( [ trelation ] )",
    ", we can express the viscosity parameter @xmath25 as @xmath26 it is very important to emphasize that in this model @xmath25 is only a function of @xmath27 and @xmath9 : the temperature in the mid - plane is determined by eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , and this temperature sets the opacity which in turn determines the optical depth @xmath19 .",
    "the opacity in the range of temperatures and densities of interest to us is set by light scattering off ice grains and , in some cases , by scattering off metal dust .",
    "the relevant regimes are worked out in the literature on protoplanetary discs ; we use the analytical fit to the opacity ( in @xmath28/gm ) from the appendix of bell and lin , 1994 .",
    "@xmath29 in the first interval the opacity is due to ice grains ; in the second interval the ice grains evaporate , and the opacity drops sharply with the temperature ; in the third interval ( the highest @xmath13 ) dust grains are the major source of the opacity .    from eq .",
    "( [ alpha1 ] ) we see that as @xmath27 of the disc increases due to the merger - driven infall , the effective viscosity will reach @xmath30 . at this stage the cooling time of",
    "the disc becomes comparable to the orbital period .",
    "gammie s simulations show that in this case the turbulence induced by self - gravity is no longer able to keep the disc together , and the disc fragments .",
    "gammie s simulations give @xmath31 ; the numerical value we quote disagrees with gammie s , but agrees with @xmath32 quoted by goodman ( 2003 ) since like goodman we use isothermal speed of sound for @xmath25-prescription .",
    "gammie s results , although obtained for razor - thin discs , justify the key assumption of our model : _ the disc exists as a whole for @xmath33 , and fragments once @xmath34_. similar criterion for the disc fragmentation was already used in shlosman and begelman , 1987",
    ".    we shall refer to the mid - plane temperature and surface density of the marginally fragmenting disc with @xmath34 as the critical temperature @xmath35 and the critical surface density , @xmath36 .",

    "the critically self - gravitating disc is optically thin if the second term of the lhs of eq .",

    "this can be expressed as a condition on the critical temperature : the disc is optically thin if @xmath43 and optically thick for higher critical temperatures .",

    "so far in determining the structure of the self - gravitating disc , we have neglected external or internal heating of the disc .",
    "this is certainly a poor approximation in many cases .",
    "irradiation from agn or surrounding stars , or feedback from star formation inside the disc can be the dominant source of heating of the outer parts of agn discs ( eg , shlosman and begelman 1987 , 1989 ) . for example , irradiation from circumnuclear stars will keep the disc temperature at a few tens of kelvin , which is higher than the critical temperature we obtained for a self - gravitating disc beyond @xmath3pc away from @xmath52 black hole ; see our discussion for the galactic center disc in section 4 .",
    "the extra heating will always work to increase the critical temperature at which the disc fragmentation occurs .",
    "therefore , the values of the critical surface density @xmath53 , scaleheight @xmath54 , and the mass of the initial fragment @xmath55 obtained above should be treated as lower bounds of what might be expected around real agns or protostars .",

    "thus , even if the clumps do not merge with each other and stop their growth at the gap - opening mass , for high accretion rate the mass of the formed stars will be biased towards the high - mass end . in the next section",
    "we discuss the effects of clump mergers and the mass range of stars born after the disc fragments .",
    "gammie s simulations show that once the disc fragments , the clumps merge and form significantly larger objects .",

    "the energy radiated from the clump per unit time is @xmath63 this radiated power can not exceed the clumps gravitational binding energy released in free - fall time , @xmath64 .",
    "together with @xmath65 [ since ice grains dominate opacity for the optically - thin marginally fragmenting disc  see eq .",
    "( [ tcrit1 ] ) ] , this condition implies that @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant for the collapsing optically thin clump .",
    "the temperature @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) is less than the virial temperature , which scales as @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , after the collapse commences , the clump is not virialized while it is optically thin . the temperature can not be much smaller than @xmath68 , since otherwise the cooling rate would be much smaller than the rate of release of the gravitational binding energy , and the gas would heat up by quasi - adiabatic compression .",
    "the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) should be substituted by an approximate equality , and therefore we have during optically - thin collapse @xmath70 the optical depth scales as @xmath71 and hence rises sharply as the clump s radius decreases ; as the clump shrinks it becomes optically thick .",
    "we suspect that in most cases the clump becomes optically thick before it sub - fragments , since the jean s mass has a slow dependence on the optical depth .",
    "however , only detailed numerical simulations can resolve these issues . ] .",
    "it is possible to show that once the clump is optically thick , it virializes quickly with it s temperature @xmath72 . for @xmath73 ( ice grains ) , the cooling time of an optically thick clump scales with the clump radius as @xmath74 the characteristic timescale for the clump to collide with another clump scales with the clump radius as @xmath75 from eqs .",
    "( [ tcool ] ) and ( [ tcoll ] ) , we see that the collision rate decreases less steeply than the cooling rate as a function of the radius of an optically thick clump .",
    "therefore , merger can be an efficient way of increasing the clump s mass .    this conclusion is no longer valid when the temperature of the clump becomes larger than @xmath76k ; then the opacity is dominated by metal dust with @xmath77 . in this case",
    "the cooling time scales as @xmath78 .",
    "the collision timescale increases faster than the cooling time as the clump shrinks , and naively one would expect that mergers may not be efficient in growing the clump masses .",
    "however , we have neglected the rotational support within a clump .",
    "each clump is initially rotating with angular frequency comparable to the clump s inverse dynamical timescale ; for example , in a keplerian disc each clump s initial angular velocity is @xmath79 .",
    "therefore each clump will shrink and collapse into a rotationally supported disc , and the size of this disc is comparable to the size of the original clump ( this picture seems to be in agreement with gammie s simulations ) .",
    "thus rotational support generally slows down the collapse of an individual fragment and makes mergers between different fragments to be efficient .",
    "magnetic braking is one of the ways for the clump to lose its rotational support ( see , e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "one generally expects a horizontal magnetic field to be present in a differentially rotating disc due to the mri ( balbus and hawley , 1991 ) .",
    "ionization fraction in the disc is expected to be small , so the magnetic field is saturated at a sub - equipartition value @xmath80 , with @xmath81 .",
    "horizontal magnetic field will couple inner and outer parts of the differentially rotating clump on the alfven crossing timescale @xmath82 , and the collapse will proceed on this timescale as well .    what is the maximum mass that the clump can achieve ?",
    "this issue has been analyzed for the similar situation of a protoplanetary core accreting from a disc of planetesimals ( rafikov 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the growing clump can not accrete more mass than is present in it s `` feeding annulus '' .",
    "this gives the maximum `` isolation '' mass of a clump : @xmath83 where , as above , @xmath84 is the mass scale of the first clumps to form from a disc ; see , e.g. , eq .  ( 2 ) of rafikov ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , numerical work of ida and makino ( 1993 ) and analytical calculations of rafikov ( 2001 ) indicate that the isolation mass may be hard to reach .",
    "the consider a massive body moving on a circular orbit through a disc of gravitationally interacting particles , and they find that when the mass of the body exceeds some critical value , an annular gap is opened in the particle disc around the body s orbit .",
    "we can idealize a disc consisting of fragments as a disc of particles of a typical fragment mass @xmath85 .",
    "once a growing clump opens a gap in a disc of gravitationally interacting fragments , the clump s growth may become quenched .",
    "this gap - opening mass of the clump @xmath86 is given by eq .",

    "it is likely that the most massive clumps will reach @xmath86 , but it will be more difficult to form a clump with the mass @xmath90 .    from fig .",
    "@xmath93 we see that the most massive clumps can reach tens hundreds of solar masses .",
    "the expected e - folding time for the clump growth is comparable to the orbital period , and thus these high masses will be reached within @xmath94 orbital periods .",
    "the maximum mass would be even larger if we included the heating of the disc by external irradiation or internal starburst .",
    "it is plausible that these very massive clumps will form massive stars ; the masses of the stars may be comparable to the masses of the original clumps ; see mckee and tan ( 2002 ) and references therein .",
    "goodman and tan ( 2004 ) have argued that a protostar accreting from the accretion disc will reach the isolation mass ; see also nayakshin and cuadra ( 2005 ) and nayakshin ( 2005 ) .",
    "this conclusion was criticized by milosavljevic and loeb ( ml , 2004 ) , who have shown that the mini - accretion disc around the star itself will be unstable to fragmentation .",
    "our picture of merging clumps forming a massive protostellar core is not susceptible to the ml s criticism .",
    "so far we have mostly considered an idealized situation where the disc is self - luminous and not irradiated externally . however , a gaseous disc in the galactic center ( when there is one ) is heated from outside by the light from bright stars in the cusp ( mostly uv ) , and re - radiates this in the infrared .",

    ". however , ( a ) it is unclear how a young binary would get onto a plunging orbit during its lifetime , and ( b ) some of the s - stars eccentricities are not high ; for example s1 and s13 have eccentricities of around 0.4 ( eisenhauer et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "it is certainly impossible to capture stars on orbits with such low eccentricity by disruption of stellar binaries , since the typical eccentricity scales as @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath59 is the mass of the binary and sgra * , respectively .",
    "therefore , one has to appeal to a fast relaxation twice : the first time , to get the binary on a plunging orbit when it is far from sgra * , and the second time , to get the star s eccentricity relaxed to a lower value when it is close to sgra*.    rauch and tremaine ( 1996 ) have identified a fast relaxation process near supermassive black holes , and called it the `` resonant relaxation '' ( rr ) .",
    "here we argue that it is potentially important for the s - stars ; this argument has also been made independently by hopman and alexander ( 2006 ) the characteristic timescale for the eccentricity change due to rr is given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the typical mass of a star in the cusp [ which is thought to be dominated by stellar - mass black holes in the central @xmath3pc , see miralda - escude and gould ( 2000 ) ] , @xmath128 is the orbital period of the star , and @xmath129 is the numerical coefficient , found to be approximately @xmath130 by rauch and tremaine .",
    "equation ( [ trr ] ) is valid so long as relativistic precession is longer than the newtonian precession due to the cusp .",
    "otherwise , the expression for @xmath131 has to be multiplied by the ratio of the two precession frequencies .",
    "the longest measured period of the s - star is that of s1 , which has @xmath132yr ( eisenhauer et al .",
    ", 2005 , see also ghez et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "thus the longest rr timescale for the s - star is of order @xmath133myr , well within a possible lifetime of the main sequence b stars .",
    "the rr relaxation timescales are shorter for all the other stars , the shortest one being for s2 : @xmath134myr . given that we do not know the typical mass of a stellar - mass black hole in the cusp , we conclude that * rr is a viable mechanism for relaxation of orbits of all of the s - stars within their lifetime*.    however , there is no mechanism known to us which would place the young stars on plunging orbits when they are further out from the sgra * , as required in both gould and quillen ( 2003 ) and alexander and livio ( 2004 ) scenarios .",
    "we therefore suggest that the s - stars were born during the previous starburst or several starbursts , and then migrated towards smaller radii through their parent discs .",
    "this possibility was already pointed out in lb ; it is known as type - i migration in planetary dynamics . the migration velocity through the disc",
    "is given by @xmath135 cf .",
    "( 9 ) , ( b4 ) and ( b5 ) of rafikov ( 2002 ) , and ward ( 1986 ) . here",
    "@xmath101 is a numerical factor of order @xmath136 for @xmath137 , and can be significantly larger for @xmath138 . from eq .",
    "( [ cs ] ) we see that the migration timescale for an s - star embedded in the disc at @xmath3pc is of order @xmath2yr , i.e.  much shorter than the star s lifetime .",
    "complication arises if the star opens a gap in the disc .",
    "however , in this case a fast runaway migration is possible due to co - rotation torques acting on the star ; the speed of the runaway migration is comparable to that of type - i migration ( artymowicz 2003 , masset and papaloizou 2003 ) .",
    "stars with masses of a few tens of solar masses will produce black holes as the end product of their rapid ( @xmath139yr ) evolution ; the characteristic mass of these black holes is believed to be around @xmath140 .",
    "a recent work by mirabel and rodrigues ( 2003 ) shows that the black holes whose progenitors have masses @xmath141 do not receive a velocity kick at their birth .",
    "thus , significant fraction of the disc - born black holes will remain embedded in the disc .",
    "it is likely that the newly - born black hole in the disc inspirals towards the central black hole .",
    "we imagine that the stellar - mass black hole is embedded into a massive accretion disc which forms due to continuing infall of gas from the galactic bulge , after the black hole is born .",
    "if the black hole opens a gap in the disc , it will move towards the central black hole together with the disc ( type - ii migration ; gould and rix 2000 , and armitage and natarajan 2001 ) .",
    "the timescale for such inspiral is the accretion timescale , @xmath142 if on the other hand , the black hole is not massive enough to open the gap , it will migrate inwards by exciting density waves in the disc ( type - i migration , see previous section ) .",
    "the speed of this inward drift is given by eq .",
    "( [ typeiv ] ) . for a self - gravitating disc with @xmath138",
    ", we find @xmath143    what determines whether the gap is open or not is whether a stellar - mass black hole has time to accrete a few thousand solar masses of gas , which would put it above the gap - opening threshold for the typical disc parameters .",
    "the eddington - limited accretion occurs on a timescale of @xmath0yr , much longer than the characteristic type - i inspiral time .",
    "thus , in this case the black holes do nt accrete much on their way in . on the other hand ,",
    "the bondi - hoyle formula predicts the mass e - folding timescale of a few hundred years .",
    "thus , if the black hole is allowed to accrete at the bondi - hoyle rate , its mass increases rapidly until it opens a gap in the disc . then , the inspiral proceeds via type - ii migration .    from eqs .",
    "( [ typeii ] ) and ( [ typei ] ) we see that the embedded black hole experiencing type - i or type - ii migration would merge with the central black hole on the timescale @xmath144@xmath145 years , shorter than the typical timescale of an agn activity .",
    "thus it is plausible that the daughter disc - born black hole is brought towards the parent central black hole ; the mass of the daughter black hole might grow significantly on the way in .",
    "gravitational radiation will eventually become the dominant mechanism driving the inspiral , and the final merger will produce copious amount of gravitational waves . in the next subsection",
    "we show that these waves are detectable by lisa for a broad range of the black hole masses and the disc accretion rate .",
    "it is realistic to expect that lisa would follow the last year of the inspiral of the disc - born black hole into the central black hole .",
    "generally , one must develop a set of templates which densely span the parameter space of possible inspiral signals . in order for the final inspiral to be detectable",
    ", one of the templates must follow the signal with the phase - shift between the two not exceeding a fraction of a cycle . therefore",
    ", if the drag from the disc will alter the waveform by a fraction of a cycle over the signal integration time ( e.g. , @xmath41 year ) , detection of the signal with high signal - to - noise ratio will become problematic .",
    "below we address the influence of the accretion disc on the final inpiral waveform .",
    "the issue of gas - drag influence on the lisa signal was first addressed by narayan ( 2000 ) ; see also chakrabarti ( 1996 ) .",
    "narayan s analysis is directly applicable to low - luminosity non - radiative quasi - spherical accretion flows , which might exist around supermassive black holes when the accretion rate is @xmath146 of the eddington limit .",
    "narayan concluded that non - radiative flows will not have any observable influence on the gravitational - wave signals seen by lisa .",
    "below we extend narayan s analysis to the case of radiative disc - like flows with high accretion rate , which are likely to be present in high - luminosity agns .",
    "consider a non - rotating central black hole of mass @xmath147 , accreting at a significant fraction @xmath148 of the eddington rate , @xmath149 .",
    "the accretion disc in the region of interest ( @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the schwartzschild radius of the central black hole ) is radiation - pressure dominated , and the opacity @xmath152 is due to the thompson scattering . by following the standard thin - disc theory ( shakura and sunyaev , 1973 ) ,",
    "we get @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the efficiency with which the accreted mass converts into radiation , and @xmath155 is the schwartzschild radius of the central black hole ; and @xmath156    the disc black hole in orbit around the central black hole excites density waves in the disc ( goldreich and tremaine , 1980 ) ; these waves carry angular momentum flux @xmath157 here , as before , @xmath158 is the mass of the orbiting disc black hole .",
    "ward ( 1987 ) has argued that the torque acting on the orbiting body is @xmath159 .",
    "we can compute the characteristic timescale for the orbit evolution due to the density - waves torque : @xmath160 one must compare @xmath161 to the timescale @xmath162 of orbital evolution due to gravitational - radiation - reaction torque : @xmath163 here , @xmath164 is the time left before the disc and central holes merge , i.e.  the integration time for the lisa signal .",
    "optimistically we could expect to follow the lisa signal to @xmath3 of a cycle .",
    "therefore , if @xmath165 is less than unity , the disc drag does not impact detection of the final inspiral ; cf .",
    "( 16 ) of narayan ( 2000 ) . here",
    "@xmath166 is the number of cycles the disc black hole will make before merging with the central black hole . using eqs .",
    "( [ sigmabh ] ) , ( [ csbh ] ) , ( [ torquewaves ] ) , and ( [ tgw ] ) , we get @xmath167 where @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 .",
    "we see that for a large range of parameters @xmath171 , and the disc drag does not influence the inpiral signal .",
    "however , note that @xmath172 is a very sensitive function of @xmath148 and @xmath158 . for instance",
    ", the disc will influence significantly an inspiraling @xmath173 black hole when the accretion rate is down to a few percent of the eddington limit .",
    "one then needs to reduce the influence of the disc on the lisa signal by choosing to observe the smaller portion of the final inspiral , i.e.  by choosing a smaller integration time @xmath164 .",
    "there is another important source of drag experienced by the inspiraling black hole ; it was first analyzed by chakrabarti ( 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "generally , there is a radial pressure gradient in an accretion disc ; this pressure gradient makes the azimuthal velocity of the disc gas slightly different from a velocity of the test particle on a circular orbit at the same radius .",
    "therefore the inspiraling black hole will experience a head wind from a gas in the accretion disc ; by accreting gas from the disc the black hole will experience the braking torque which will make it lose it s specific angular momentum .",
    "this torque is given by @xmath174 where @xmath175 is rate of accretion onto the inspiraling black hole from the disc , and @xmath176 is the speed of the headwind experienced by the black hole moving with the orbital speed @xmath177 .",
    "we assume that the inspiraling hole accretes with the bondi - hoyle rate , @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the density of the ambient disc gas . by using the last equation in eq .",
    "( [ tauwind ] ) , we obtain the expression for the torque @xmath180 , which turns out to be the same as the torque from the density waves , up to the numerical factor between @xmath41 and @xmath181 .",
    "we see therefore that inclusion of chakrabarti s `` accretion '' torque is important for the detailed analysis , but does not qualitatively change our conclusions .",
    "can the orbiting black hole open a gap in the disc during it s final inspiral ? in order to overcome the viscous stresses which oppose opening the gap , the mass of the orbiting black hole should be greater than the threshold value given by @xmath182 see eqs .",
    "( 4 ) of lin and papaloizou ( 1986 ) .",
    "the radius @xmath183 from which the inspiral begins is given by @xmath184 and the scaleheight of the disc is radius - independent in the radiation - dominated inner region ( this is true only if you treat the central black hole as a newtonian object ) : @xmath185 the gap will be open in the disc , therefore , if the mass of the inspiraling black hole exceeds @xmath186 during the final year of merger of the @xmath140 disc - born black hole and the @xmath187 central black hole , the gap will be open if the accretion rate onto the central black hole is about five percent of the eddington limit .",
    "such gap - opening merger can result in sudden changes in the agn luminosity and produce an optical counterpart to the gravitational - wave signal .",
    "the details of black - hole formation and evolution in the disc are uncertain , and it seems impossible to make a reliable estimate of an event rate for lisa from this channel of black - hole mergers .",
    "nonetheless , the expected top - heavy imf gives us reason for optimism .",
    "it is worth working through a simple example to show that the merger of disc - born holes with the central hole may be an important source for lisa .",
    "studies of integrated light coming from galactic nuclei show that the supermassive black holes acquire significant part and perhaps almost all of their mass via accretion of gas ; see , e.g. , yu and tremaine ( 2002 ) and references therein .",
    "assume , for the sake of our example , that a mass fraction @xmath188 of this gas is converted into @xmath173 black holes on the way in , and that all of these black holes eventually merge with the central black hole .",
    "lisa can detect such mergers to @xmath189 if the central black hole is between @xmath2 and @xmath145 solar masses ( one needs to assume that the central black hole is rapidly rotating at the high - mass end of this range ) .",
    "the mass density of such black holes in the local universe is @xmath190 ( salucci et .",
    "al .  1999 ) .",
    "we can estimate , using figure @xmath191 of pei et .",
    "1995 ) , that about @xmath181 percent of integrated radiation from galactic nuclei comes from redshifts accessible to lisa , @xmath192 .",
    "this implies that supermassive black holes acquired @xmath181 percent of their mass at @xmath192 .",
    "we shall therefore assume that @xmath181 percent of the mass of the black holes in lisa mass range was accreted at @xmath192 .",
    "this implies that there were @xmath193 mergers per mpc@xmath194 which are potentially detectable by lisa .",
    "when we multiply this by volume out to @xmath189 and divide it by the hubble time , we get an estimate of the lisa event rate from such mergers , @xmath195 the estimate above should be treated as an illustration of importance for our channel of the mergers , rather than as a concrete prediction for lisa .",
    "currently , it is not known how to compute well the gravitational waveform produced by an inspiral with an arbitrary eccentricity and inclination relative to the central black hole .",
    "this might pose a great challenge to the lisa data analysis .",
    "indeed , in the currently popular astrophysical scenario , the stellar - mass black hole gets captured on a highly eccentric orbit with arbitrary inclination relative to the central black hole ( sigurdsson and rees , 1997 ) . by contrast , in our scenario the inspiral occurs in the equatorial plane , and the signal is well understood ( hughes 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "circular inspiral is also expected in the binary - disruption scenario of miller et al .",
    "2005 ; however there the inspiral is not expected to be preferentially aligned with the equatorial plane .",
    "the template for detection of a circular inspiral is readily available , and the merger channel we consider has a clear observational signature which distinguishes it from other channels .",
    "it is an open question whether the inspiraling hole can acquire high eccentricity by interacting with the disc or with other orbiting masses ( goldreich and sari 2003 , chiang et .",
    "al .  2002 ) ; it seems likely that at least in some cases interaction with the disc will act to circularize the orbit .",
    "finn and thorne ( 2000 ) have performed a detailed census of parameter space for circular - orbit equatorial inspirals as seen by lisa .",
    "in this paper , we rely on numerical simulations by gammie ( 2001 ) to develop a formalism for self - gravitating thin discs which are gaining mass by continuous infall .",
    "we present a way to calculate the critical temperature , surface density , and scaleheigh of the disc just prior to fragmentation .",
    "our formalism naturally includes both optically thin and optically thick discs .",
    "we then speculate on the outcome of the nonlinear physical processes which follow fragmentation : accretion and merger of smaller fragments into bigger ones .",
    "we find an upper bound on the mass of final , merged fragments , and we give a plausibility argument that some fragments will indeed reach this upper bound .",
    "we thus predict that very massive stars of tens or even hundreds of solar masses will be produced in self - gravitating discs around supermassive black holes .",
    "this picture explains well recent observations of the stellar discs in the galactic center , and we clarify how the peculiar orbits of the s - stars may be generated by a combination of inward migration through the gaseous disc and resonant relaxation in the central arc - second .",
    "the end product of fast evolution of the massive stars will be stellar - mass black holes .",
    "we make an argument that in the case when accretion is prolonged , the disc - born black holes in agns find a way to merge with central black holes .",
    "we consider a purely toy - model example of what the rate of such mergers might be , as seen by lisa ; we illustrate this rate might be high enough to be interesting for future gravitational - wave ( gw ) observations .",
    "the gw signal from this merger channel is distinct from that of other channels , and can be readily modeled using our current theoretical understanding of the final stages of the inspiral driven by gravitational - radiation reaction .",
    "we show that for a broad range of accretion rates and black - hole masses the drag from accretion disc will not be large enough to pollute the signal and make inspiral template invalid . in some cases , the inspiraling hole will open a gap in the accretion disc close to the central black hole , thus producing a possible optical counterpart for the gravitational - wave burst generated by the merger .",
    "i have greatly benefited from discussions with chris matzner and scott tremaine .",
    "this paper is largely based on my earlier preprint ( levin , 2003 ) .",
    "i thank norm murray and clovis hopman for encouraging me to publish it ."
