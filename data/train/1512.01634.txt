    "one of the central problems in quantum science and technology is the estimation of an unknown quantum state @xcite .",
    "quantum state tomography as the procedure of experimentally determining an unknown quantum state has become a standard technology for verification and benchmarking of quantum devices @xcite .",
    "two key tasks in quantum state tomography are data acquisition and data analysis . the aim of data acquisition is to devise appropriate measurement strategies to acquire information for reconstructing the quantum state . then in the step of data analysis , the acquired data is associated with an estimate of the unknown quantum state using an estimation algorithm .    in order to enhance the efficiency in data acquisition , it is desired to develop optimal measurement strategies for collecting data .",
    "however , an optimal measurement strategy , which is only known for a few special cases  @xcite , depends on the state to be reconstructed . to circumvent this issue ,",
    "many kinds of fixed sets of measurement bases are designed to be optimal either in terms of the average over a certain quantum state space @xcite or in terms of the worst case in the quantum state space @xcite .",
    "for instance , improved state estimation can be achieved by taking advantage of mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) @xcite and symmetric informationally complete positive operator - valued measures ( sic - povm ) @xcite . for multi - partite quantum systems , mub and sic - povm",
    "are difficult to experimentally realize since they involve nonlocal measurements .",
    "how to efficiently acquire information of an unknown quantum state using simple measurements that are easy to realize experimentally remains open .    for data analysis in tomography ,",
    "although many methods , such as maximum - likelihood estimation @xcite , bayesian mean estimation @xcite , least - squared inversion @xcite , have been used to reconstruct the quantum state , this task can be computationally intensive , and may take even more time than the experiments themselves .",
    "it has been reported in @xcite that using the maximum - likelihood method to reconstruct eight - qubit took weeks of computation .",
    "therefore , the development of an efficient data analysis algorithm is also a critical issue in quantum state tomography @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a recursive linear regression estimation algorithm was presented which is much more computationally efficient in the sense that it can greatly save the cost of computation as compared to the maximum - likelihood method with only a small amount of accuracy sacrificed .    for a given number of copies of the system , in order to improve the tomography accuracy by better tomographic measurements , a natural idea is to develop an adaptive tomography protocol where the measurement can be adaptively optimized based on data collected so far .",
    "adaptive measurements have shown more powerful capability than nonadaptive measurements in quantum phase estimation @xcite , phase tracking @xcite , quantum state discrimination @xcite , and hamiltonian estimation @xcite .",
    "actually , adaptivity has been proposed for quantum state tomography in various contexts @xcite .",
    "for example , the results on one qubit have demonstrated that adaptive quantum state tomography can improve the accuracy quadratically considering the infidelity index @xcite .",
    "however , when generalizing their results to @xmath0-qubit systems , the adaptive tomography protocol will involve nonlocal measurements which are hard to realize in experiments .    in this paper , we combine the computational efficiency of the recursive technique of @xcite with a new adaptive protocol that does not necessarily require nonlocal measurement to present a new recursively adaptive quantum state tomography ( raqst ) protocol . in our raqst protocol",
    ", no prior assumption is made on the state to be reconstructed .",
    "the state estimate is recursively updated based on the current estimate and the new measurement data .",
    "thus , we do not have to combine all the historical information with the new acquired data to update the estimate as the maximum - likelihood method .",
    "thanks to the simple recursive estimation procedure , we can obtain the estimate state in a realtime way , and using the estimate we can adaptively optimize the measurement strategies to be performed in the following step . in our raqst protocol , the measurement to be performed at each step is optimized upon the corresponding admissible measurement set determined by the experimental conditions .",
    "it is first demonstrated numerically that our raqst even with the simplest product measurements can outperform the tomography protocols using mubs and the two - stage mub adaptive strategy . for maximally entangled states ,",
    "the infidelity can even be reduced to beat the gill - massar bound which is a quantum cramr - rao inequality @xcite . moreover , if nonlocal measurements are available , with our raqst the infidelity can be further reduced . for a wide range of quantum states ,",
    "the infidelity of our raqst can be reduced to beat the gill - massar bound with a modest number of copies .",
    "we perform the two - qubit state tomography experiments using only the simplest product measurements , and the experimental results demonstrate that the improvement of our raqst over nonadaptive tomography is significant for states with a high level of purity .",
    "this limit ( very high purity ) is the one relevant for most forms of quantum information processing .",
    "a linear regression estimation ( lre ) method for quantum state tomography was proposed in @xcite , and the results have shown that the lre approach has much lower computational complexity than the maximum - likelihood estimation method for quantum tomography . here , we further develop this lre method to present a recursively adaptive quantum state tomography protocol that can greatly improve the precision of tomography .",
    "we first convert a quantum state tomography problem into a parameter estimation problem of a linear regression model .",
    "consider a @xmath1-dimensional quantum system with hilbert space @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 denote a set of hermitian operators satisfying ( i ) @xmath4 and ( ii ) @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the kronecker function .",
    "using this set , the quantum state @xmath7 to be reconstructed can be parameterized as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the identity matrix and @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the transpose operation .",
    "a quantum measurement can be described by a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xmath13 , which is a set of positive semidefinite matrices that sum to the identity , i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in quantum state tomography , different sets of povms should be appropriately combined to efficiently acquire information of the unknown quantum state .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the admissible measurement set , which is a union of povms determined by the experimental conditions .",
    "each povm is denoted as @xmath17 . using the set of @xmath18",
    ", elements of the povm can be parameterized as @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 when we perform the povm @xmath23 on copies of a system in state @xmath7 , the probability that we observe the result @xmath24 is given by @xmath25    assume that the total number of experiments is @xmath26 , and we perform a measurement described by @xmath27 @xmath28 times .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the number of the occurrence of the outcome @xmath24 from the @xmath28 measurement trials of @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "according to the central limit theorem , @xmath32 converges in distribution to a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance @xmath33/n^{(j)}$ ] . using ( [ averageequation ] )",
    ", we have the linear regression equations for @xmath34 , @xmath35 note that @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are all available , while @xmath32 may be considered as the observation noise .",
    "hence , the problem of quantum state tomography is converted into the estimation of the unknown vector @xmath39 .    to give an estimate with a high level of accuracy , the basic idea of lre",
    "is to find an estimate @xmath40 such that    @xmath41 ^ 2.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath42 denotes the povm @xmath43 being performed at the @xmath44-th step .",
    "the notation @xmath45 denotes the weight of the corresponding linear regression equation . in general , the smaller the variance of @xmath46 is , the more the information can be extracted by @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding weight of the regression equation should be larger . a sound choice of @xmath45 is the estimate of the inverse of the variance of @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "a recursive lre algorithm @xcite can be utilized to find the solution of @xmath40 . for completeness",
    ", we present the recursive lre algorithm in appendix a. its basic idea is that one only needs to store the best estimate state so far , and then update it recursively using a bunch of new measurement results with a fixed setting .",
    "this is quite different from the maximum - likelihood estimation method since there one has to combine all the historical information with the new collected data to update the estimate , which is quite computationally intensive .",
    "it has been demonstrated in fig . 1 of @xcite that the recursive lre tomography algorithm can greatly reduce the total cost of computation with only a small amount of accuracy sacrificed in comparison with the maximum - likelihood estimation method .",
    "as demonstrated in appendix b , when the number of copies @xmath26 of the unknown quantum state becomes large , the only relevant measure of the quality of estimation becomes the mean squared error matrix @xmath50 .",
    "the mean squared error matrix depends upon the state @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) to be reconstructed and the chosen povms .",
    "thanks to the recursive algorithm , we can obtain the estimate of the state @xmath7 recursively , and then adaptively optimize the povm measurements that should be performed . by doing so , the accuracy of the tomography can be greatly improved .",
    "the details of how to adaptively choose povms are presented in appendix c.    using the solution @xmath51 in ( [ theta ] ) and the relationship in ( [ rho ] ) , we can obtain a hermitian matrix @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "however , @xmath52 may have negative eigenvalues and be nonphysical due to the randomness of measurement results . in this work ,",
    "the physical estimate @xmath54 is chosen to be the closest density matrix to @xmath52 under the matrix 2-norm . in standard state reconstruction algorithms , this task is computationally intensive @xcite .",
    "however , we can employ the fast algorithm in @xcite with computational complexity @xmath55 to solve this problem since we have a hermitian estimate @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "it can be verified that pulling @xmath52 back to a physical state can further reduce the mean squared error @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the numerical results .",
    "first of all , we would like to stress two advantages of the recursive lre method : ( a ) as we have demonstrated in @xcite , the recursive lre method can greatly reduce the cost of computation in comparison with the maximum - likelihood method ; ( b ) the recursive lre algorithm is naturally suitable for optimizing measurements adaptively . the argument for the advantage ( b )",
    "can be explained as follows . for state tomography",
    "the optimal measurements generally depend upon the state to be reconstructed . by utilizing the recursive lre algorithm ,",
    "we can obtain the estimate of the real state in a computationally efficient way . using the state estimate , the measurements to be performed can be adaptively optimized . in the following ,",
    "we perform numerical simulations of two - qubit tomography using only the recursive lre method while with six different measurement strategies : ( i ) standard cube measurements @xcite ; ( ii ) mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) measurements ; ( iii ) mub half - half @xcite ; ( iv )  known basis \" @xcite ; ( v ) raqst1 : the admissible measurement set only contains the simplest product measurements ; ( vi ) raqst2 : the admissible measurement set is not limited .",
    "each of the tomography protocols ( iii)-(vi ) consists of two stages . in the first stage ,",
    "we all use the standard cube measurements . for the mub half - half ,",
    "we first perform standard cube measurements on @xmath56 copies and obtain a preliminary estimate @xmath57 via lre , and then measure the remaining half of copies so that one set of the bases is adaptively adjusted to diagonalize @xmath57 and it together with another four sets of bases constitutes a complete set of mub as proposed in @xcite . as compared to the mub half - half , for the  known basis \" @xcite , in the second stage , we perform a set of measurements so that one of the five bases of the mub is the eigenbasis of the state to be reconstructed .",
    "although it is impossible physically , this is a useful comparison . for the raqst ,",
    "we first perform standard cube measurements on @xmath58 copies and obtain a preliminary estimate .",
    "then we adaptively optimize the measurement to be performed at each iteration step upon the corresponding admissible measurement set ( see appendix d ) . in raqst1 ,",
    "the basic admissible measurement set is the standard cube measurement bases . at each iteration step , we add another set of product measurements obtained by solving a conditional extremum problem to the basic admissible measurement set ( see appendix e ) . in raqst2 , at each iteration step , the set of the eigenbases of the current estimate state is also added into the admissible measurement set .",
    "note that the admissible measurement set in raqst2 will involve nonlocal measurements in general if there are more than one particle .",
    "the details can be found in appendix d.    for the raqst , we need to specify @xmath58 , which is the number of copies measured in the first stage , and the number @xmath59 of the iteration steps such that @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number of copies for each povm in the second stage . in principle , the number @xmath59 of the iteration steps in the second stage may depend on the preliminary estimate in the first stage . for simplicity , in this work",
    ", we give empirical formulas depending only upon the total number @xmath26 of the copies .",
    "note that in raqst1 and raqst2 , the admissible measurement sets are different , and so are their empirical formulas .",
    "for raqst1 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and for raqst2 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 returns the maximum integer that is less than or equal to @xmath67 .",
    "obviously the formula for the resource distribution for raqst2 applies only when @xmath26 is not too large .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to demonstrate the results .",
    "the figure of merit is the particularly well - motivated quantum infidelity @xcite , @xmath68 .",
    "[ fig0:subfig : a ] depicts average infidelity versus @xmath26 for the maximally entangled state @xmath69",
    ". it can be seen that the average infidelity of the static tomography protocols ( i.e. , ( i ) and ( ii ) ) versus @xmath26 is in the order of @xmath70 . however , the gill - massar bound @xcite for the infidelity in two - qubit state tomography is @xmath71 .",
    "this can be obtained by combining the equations ( 5.29 ) and ( a.8 ) in @xcite ( see appendix  [ sec : append : gm bound ] ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that , as compared to the static tomography protocols and the adaptive mub half - half , the average infidelity using our raqst protocol can be reduced to beat the gill - massar bound even only with the simplest product measurements . furthermore ,",
    "if there is no limitation on the admissible measurement set , the raqst2 can outperform the  known basis \" tomography , and the average infidelity of raqst2 versus @xmath26 can be significantly reduced to the order of the gill - massar bound , i.e. , @xmath72 .    fig .",
    "[ fig0:subfig : b ] shows the histogram for raqst over 200 randomly selected pure states and 200 maximally entangled states when the total number of copies is @xmath73 for each random state .",
    "random pure states are created using the algorithm in @xcite .",
    "since all the maximally entangled states are equivalent under local unitary operations , they are randomly selected by applying randomly generated local unitary operators @xcite on the same maximally entangled states .",
    "we adopt the index @xmath74 to evaluate the performance of our raqst protocol . here , @xmath75 and @xmath76 represent the @xmath77 of the average infidelity between the corresponding estimate and the true state when the standard cube measurement bases and the raqst are utilized , respectively , while @xmath78 is the gill - massar bound .",
    "note that if @xmath79 , our adaptive protocol surpasses the standard measurement strategy , while if @xmath80 , our adaptive protocol beats the gill - massar bound . from fig .",
    "[ fig0:subfig : b ] we can see that our raqst protocol is particularly effective for the class of maximally entangled states which are important resources in quantum information .",
    "[ fig : subfig : a ] depicts average infidelity versus @xmath26 for state @xmath81 , which has purity tr@xmath82=0.9955 .",
    "note that there are kinks in the four curves corresponding to the four different adaptive protocols ( iii)-(vi ) .",
    "we can see that each of the four curves can be divided into three segments from left to right . in the first segment ,",
    "the infidelity decreases quickly as @xmath26 increases until the infidelity is reduced to the order of the small eigenvalues of the state to be reconstructed , then the curves go into the second segment where the infidelity decreases slowly . after",
    "the infidelity is smaller than the smallest eigenvalues , the infidelity decreases quickly again as @xmath26 increases .",
    "this is because infidelity is hypersensitive to misestimation of small eigenvalues , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "hence , we must accurately estimate the eigenvalues that appear to be zero .",
    "when the infidelity is in the order of the smallest eigenvalues , it will be hard to estimate them accurately , so the decay rate of the infidelity will become slow . once the infidelity decreases to be smaller than the smallest eigenvalues , we can estimate them more accurately as @xmath26 increases , and then the infidelity decreases quickly .",
    "it can be seen that our raqst1 can beat the static tomography protocols and the adaptive mub half - half protocol even with the simplest product measurements .",
    "the infidelity can be further reduced by using raqst2 , and when the total copies @xmath83 , the infidelity can be reduced to @xmath72 .",
    "[ fig : subfig : b ] shows average infidelity versus different purity when the total number of the copies for each state is @xmath73 .",
    "the quantum states are @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and satisfy @xmath86 the results show that when the states have a high level of purity , our raqst1 with the simplest product measurements can beat the mub protocol . however , as the state becomes more mixed ( @xmath87 decreases ) , using mub measurements for state tomography can do better than using the adaptive product measurements .",
    "this fact is due to the essential limit of product measurements on mixed states .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , nonlocal measurements on a mixed state can extract more information .",
    "thus , to reconstruct mixed states , it is better to use nonlocal measurements , e.g. , mub measurements .",
    "it is also clear that the infidelity achieved by using raqst2 is much lower than that using mub , and can beat the gill - massar bound for a wide range of quantum states .",
    "in this section , we report the experimental results using our raqst protocol for two - qubit quantum state tomography .",
    "since it is hard to perform nonlocal measurements in real experiments , we only experimentally implement tomography protocols using ( i ) standard cube measurements and ( v ) raqst1 .    as shown in fig .",

    "the generation rate is about 3000 two - photon coincidence counts per second at a pump power of 60 mw .",
    "half - wave plates at both ends of the two single mode fibers are used to control polarization .",
    "then , one photon is either reflected by or transmits through a 50/50 beam splitter ( bs ) . in the transmission path ,",
    "a qwp is tilted to compensate the phase of the two - photon state for the generation of @xmath92 . in the reflected path , three 446 @xmath93 quartz crystals and a half wave plate with 22.5@xmath94",
    "are used to dephase the two - photon state into a completely mixed state @xmath95 .",
    "the ratio of the two states mixed at the output port of the second bs can be changed by the two adjustable apertures for the generation of arbitrary werner state in the form @xmath96 .",
    "note that since the coherence length of the photon is only 176 @xmath93 ( due to the 4 nm bandwidth of the interference filter ( if ) ) , much smaller than the optical path difference which is about 0.5 m , two states from the reflected and transmission path only mix at the second bs rather than coherently superpose . in the adaptive measurement module ,",
    "the two - photon product measurements are realized by the combinations of quarter - wave plates , half - wave plates , polarizing beam splitters , single photon detectors and a coincidence circuit .",
    "the rotation angles of quarter - wave plates and half - wave plates can be adaptively adjusted by a controller according to the analysis of the collected coincidence data on a computer .    in the first experiment , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2:subfig : a ] , we realize raqst1 and standard cube measurements tomography protocols for entangled states with a high level of purity with respect to different number of resources @xmath26 ranging from 251 to 251189 .",

    "phase errors of the currently used true zero - order qwps and hwps are @xmath99 , which dominate the systematic error of practically realized measurements .",
    "these error sources induce a systematic error to the estimate state , which can be characterized by its infidelity from the true state .",
    "the systematic error is in the order of 10@xmath100 when the error sources take the above values . for resource number @xmath101 , the systematic error is of the same scale as or even larger than the statistical error due to finite resources ( @xmath26 copies ) . to deal with this problem ,",

    "recall that the weight of the @xmath150-th linear regression equation is approximately equal to the inverse of @xmath151 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath152 and @xmath153 correspond to different povms , they are independent , and so @xmath154 . therefore , we can adaptively choose povms to minimize @xmath147 .",
    "our raqst protocol is presented as follows .",
    "it can be divided into two stages . in the first stage , we perform a standard linear regression estimation on @xmath58 copies with the standard cube measurement bases to get a prelimiary @xmath137 and @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "next in the second stage we set the initial value @xmath156 in ( [ recursiveofq ] ) and @xmath157 in ( [ main ] ) , and then utilize the remaining @xmath158 copies for adaptive linear regression estimation .",
    "suppose after @xmath159 steps , we get @xmath160 and @xmath161 where @xmath162 . recall that @xmath42 denotes the povm @xmath43 being performed at the @xmath44-th step . if @xmath163 , @xmath164 . from ( [ recursiveofq ] ) , we can see that @xmath165 , and    @xmath166    the remaining question is how to choose povms to improve the rate of decreasing .",
    "we can choose @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) from the admissible measurement set @xmath169 such that it maximizes @xmath170 .",
    "once @xmath167 is chosen , we can perform the corresponding povm @xmath171 at the @xmath172-th step . by doing this",
    ", we can get @xmath173 linear regression equations .",
    "thus , we can utilize ( [ recursiveofq ] ) and ( [ main ] ) to get @xmath174 and @xmath175 , where @xmath176 .",
    "the above procedure is repeated until all the copies have been measured .",
    "two points should be paid attention to the above raqst protocol .",
    "the first one is when choosing @xmath167 to maximize @xmath177 , we can not get the information of @xmath178 in @xmath179 because we have not really performed the experiments . from ( [ average2 ] ) , we can use its estimate @xmath180 to replace @xmath181 another one is that given the total number of copies @xmath26 , how to determine the number of copies @xmath58 used in the first stage and the number of adaptive steps in the second stage .",
    "the optimal values remain open .",
    "we can give empirical formulas when the dimension of quantum systems for tomography is given .",
    "in two - qubit raqst , we assume that the basic admissible measurement set at each iteration step is the standard cube measurement bases , wherein all the elements are one - dimensional projectors .",
    "if we choose a projector by minimizing @xmath182 in ( [ gn ] ) as described above , it is easy to reconstruct the corresponding povm .",
    "actually , if the chosen projector is @xmath183 , the corresponding povm is @xmath184 is orthogonal to @xmath185 .    as pointed out in @xcite , in order to minimize infidelity , we must accurately estimate the small eigenvalues of the state to be reconstructed , particularly those nearly 0 eigenvalues .",
    "inspired by this , at each iteration step we find a product projector that minimizes @xmath186 .",
    "this projector can be found by a simple iteration algorithm since it is a standard conditional extremum problem .",
    "the details are given in appendix e. by doing this , the value of @xmath182 may become larger with this new projector .",
    "thus , we add the corresponding povm into the admissible measurement set at each iteration step in raqst1 . in raqst2",
    ", we further add the set of the eigenbases of the current state estimate into the admissible measurement set .",
    "note that the admissible measurement set in raqst2 will involve nonlocal measurements in general .",
    "we illustrate our algorithm in the case of two - qubit tomography .",
    "we first fix the basis set @xmath187 for one - qubit , and then we can represent the one - qubit projector measurement for the @xmath188-th qubit @xmath189 as @xmath190 here , the projector @xmath191 is orthogonal to @xmath192 .    for a two - qubit system , we take the tensor product of @xmath187 as the basis set",
    ". then any two - qubit product projectors can be parameterized as @xmath193 moreover , we can represent the quantum state as @xmath194 we further introduce the vectorization function @xmath195 and assume a @xmath196 real matrix @xmath197 such that @xmath198    with the notation we can calculate @xmath199    usually we take @xmath200 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "we then denote @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 now we have @xmath206 .",
    "to minimize @xmath207 under the constraints @xmath208 , we introduce lagrange multipliers @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and write @xmath211 . at extreme points",
    "we should have @xmath212    from ( [ eqex ] ) we can design an iterative algorithm : i ) choose @xmath213 ; ii ) in step @xmath44 , let @xmath214 and @xmath215 , where @xmath209 and @xmath210 are chosen such that @xmath216 ; iii ) repeat ( ii ) until @xmath217 is small enough .",
    "the convergence of our algorithm is straightforward to prove .",
    "note that it can be verified @xmath218 during iterations .",
    "moreover , since @xmath219 , we have @xmath220 .",
    "therefore , the sequence @xmath221 indeed has a limit and the convergence is guaranteed accordingly .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath7 is actually unknown .",
    "hence , we should take its current estimate instead of @xmath7 in the above procedure .",
    "according to ( a.8 ) in @xcite , the infidelity between two states @xmath7 and @xmath54 is related to the squared bures distance @xmath222 by @xmath223 thus , the infidelity and the squared bures distance share the same gill - massar bound in the first order approximation .",
    "since the gill - massar bound for the mean squared bures distance is @xmath224 in a @xmath1-dimensional quantum state tomography with a total number of copies @xmath26 ( ( 5.29 ) in @xcite ) , one can derive the gill - massar bound @xmath71 for the infidelity in two - qubit state tomography .",
