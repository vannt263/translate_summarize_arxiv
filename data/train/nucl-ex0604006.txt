    "in the recent searches of proton decay and in the studies of neutrino oscillations , water cherenkov detectors are used , such as super - kamiokande  @xcite . since in such detectors ,",
    "proton decays or neutrino interactions happen mostly in @xmath3o , it is important to study the effect of the nuclear de - excitation process on the cherenkov light detection in more detail .",
    "when a proton decays in one of the inner - shell orbits of @xmath3o , the residual @xmath2n nucleus remains in an excited state with a proton - hole .",
    "this state quickly de - excites by emitting @xmath0-rays with a certain probability . in the decay search involving the channel @xmath9  @xcite , which is the dominant process in many supersymmetric grand unification models  @xcite",
    ", the de - excitation @xmath0-rays would be very useful to reduce backgrounds . since the @xmath10 momentum is below the cherenkov threshold",
    ", the @xmath10 is invisible .",
    "therefore , the @xmath11 signal stemming from the @xmath10 decay can be separated from the prompt @xmath0-ray signal . on the other hand ,",
    "most backgrounds produced by events such as @xmath12 have no time difference between the @xmath0-ray and @xmath13 signals and can be eliminated when the @xmath0-ray energy ( @xmath14 ) is in the detectable energy range of the super - kamiokande .",
    "the de - excitation @xmath0-ray is also useful for the study of the neutrino neutral - current interaction via the quasi - free knock - out process , e.g. with a 1  kt water cherenkov detector  @xcite in the experiment of the long base - line neutrino oscillation from kek to super - kamiokande(k2k ) .",
    "an overall neutrino flux independent of neutrino flavor can be estimated from the measurement of the neutral - current interaction . because recoil energies of protons are mostly below the cherenkov threshold , cherenkov light from the de - excitation @xmath0-rays can be clearly observed .",
    "it is then possible to tag the neutral - current interaction with the @xmath0-rays .",
    "the de - excitation process of hole states in @xmath2n following proton decay in @xmath3o was discussed by ejiri  @xcite .",
    "he summarized de - excitation modes and their branching ratios , and estimated the emission probabilities of the de - excitation @xmath0-rays . for a hole state @xmath15 which de - excites only by @xmath0  decay , he estimated the @xmath0-ray emission probability ( @xmath16 ) by using the spectroscopic factor ( @xmath17 ) as @xmath16=@xmath17/8 , where 8 is the number of protons in @xmath3o .",
    "the 6.32  mev @xmath0-ray from the @xmath18 @xmath6-hole state to the ground state ( g.s . ) in @xmath2n , which is in the detectable energy range of the super - kamiokandedetector , is the most probable one because the state has the largest spectroscopic factor and its excitation energy is below the particle emission threshold . using the spectroscopic factor from the ( @xmath19,@xmath20he ) data  @xcite ( see table  [ tab : comp ] )",
    ", ejiri predicted that the emission probability of the 6.32  mev @xmath0-ray is 41% ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "he also estimated the @xmath0-ray emission probabilities from other @xmath6-hole and @xmath1-hole states to be several percent , respectively .",
    "however , the emission probabilities from the @xmath1-hole state around 25  mev excitation are uncertain .",
    "the @xmath1-hole state de - excites mostly by particle emissions , because the excitation energy exceeds the particle emission threshold ( 10.21  mev for proton decay and 10.83  mev for neutron decay ) .",
    "if the residual nucleus remains in an excited state , secondary @xmath0-rays are emitted .",
    "ejiri statistically evaluated the emission probabilities by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the spectroscopic factor of the excited state @xmath15 in the daughter nucleus , @xmath24 ( = 11 ) is the number of @xmath6-shell nucleons in @xmath2n , and @xmath25 is the escape ratio of the nucleon .",
    "the excited states most likely to be populated were the 7.01  mev @xmath26 state in @xmath27c and the 7.03  mev @xmath26 state in @xmath27n each with @xmath28 .",
    "however , a recent study  @xcite showed that the particle - decay data of deep - hole states in light nuclei can not be reproduced in a statistical - model calculation . the probability to remain the secondary excited states after particle emissions of the @xmath1-hole state in @xmath2n was found to be high .",
    "the results suggested that the direct two - body decay process from the door - way @xmath1-hole state predicted by the theoretical calculations based on a su(3)-model  @xcite and a shell model  @xcite considerably occurred .",
    "thus , from a nuclear - structure point of view , it is also interesting to measure such secondary de - excitation @xmath0-rays .    after the work by ejiri  @xcite ,",
    "the spectroscopic factors of @xmath6-hole state have been investigated in an @xmath3o@xmath29n experiment  @xcite .",
    "the result suggests that the spectroscopic factors in the @xmath6-shell orbits are substantially lower than the sum - rule limit ( @xmath30 ) in the independent - particle shell - model ; the spectroscopic factor of the 6.32  mev @xmath6-state is smaller than that given by ref .",
    "@xcite by 30% as shown in table  [ tab : comp ] .",
    "the difference is mainly due to a large theoretical uncertainty associated with the reaction mechanism .",
    "the spectroscopic factor derived from transfer reactions strongly depends on the delicate details of the distorted wave born approximation  @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the direct measurement of @xmath0-rays from the @xmath1-hole state is important .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we evaluate the total @xmath0-ray emission probabilities from the @xmath1-hole state associated with proton decay in @xmath3o . the emission probabilities ( @xmath16 )",
    "are evaluated using the equation @xmath31 .",
    "the spectroscopic factor of the @xmath1-hole state in the excitation - energy region at @xmath32=1640  mev is estimated to be 1.6 using the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) calculation  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the spectroscopic factor is estimated to be about 10% from the dwia calculations using different optical potentials .",
    "the total @xmath0-ray emission probabilities with @xmath33  mev and @xmath34=36  mev are estimated to be , respectively . because some extra @xmath1-hole strengths still exist at @xmath35 40  mev , the total emission probability for the whole @xmath1-hole state become slightly larger .",
    "in addition to the simple direct knockout ( @xmath36 ) reaction , the multi - step processes or correlated processes like ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) reactions contribute the excitation spectrum .",
    "@xmath39 includes such non - quasi - free contributions .",
    "the difference between @xmath40 and @xmath41 is estimated to be 15% for the extreme case that @xmath42 is zero for the non - quasi - free process .",
    "the proton decay is a slightly different process from the ( @xmath36 ) reaction , because the nuclear medium could affect the proton decay and not leave a simple hole state .",
    "the fraction of the correlated decay is estimated to be 10% by ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the emission probabilities without this effect .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission probabilities estimated for the 7.01 and 7.03  mev states are less than half of ejiri s estimate  @xcite .",
    "however , we found a few excited states to emit @xmath0-rays with @xmath43  mev . compared to the 4% @xmath0-ray emission probability with @xmath43  mev estimated by ejiri ,",
    "our emission probabilities are estimated to be 3.1% . on the basis of the @xmath44 result  @xcite , the dominant 6.32  mev @xmath0-ray from the @xmath18 @xmath6-hole state",

    "the emission probabilities of 3.1% with @xmath33  mev is found to be about 1/10 compared with that of the 6.32  mev @xmath0-ray .",
    "moreover , we found that the emission probability with @xmath34=36  mev is high , though no @xmath0-rays are quoted in this energy region in ref .",
    "@xcite . especially , the 4.4  mev @xmath0-ray emission mainly from the @xmath7c+@xmath46  decay is strong , despite the high @xmath47-value .",
    "this is consistent with the result of the particle - decay measurement  @xcite .",
    "the reason why the triton decay probability is higher than that of @xmath48  decay is theoretically explained by the selection rule obtained from the spatial su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "a 15.1  mev @xmath0-ray is emitted mainly from the t=1 ,  @xmath8 state in @xmath7c which might be made from the @xmath1-hole state in @xmath2n@xmath49 . in the @xmath0-ray data obtained by gating on the @xmath1-hole events in the excitation - energy region at @xmath32=1640  mev , we search for a signal in the energy region at @xmath14=1015.7  mev , where the peak is expected to be located based on the mc study",

    "the branching ratio of the door - way @xmath1-hole state in @xmath2n to the t=1 ,  1@xmath50 state in @xmath7c has been recently calculated in the same manner as used in ref .",

    "taking into account the 15.1  mev emission branching ratio from t=1 ,  @xmath8 state in @xmath7c and the spectroscopic factor of the @xmath1-hole state in @xmath2n , the total emission probability is predicted to be @xmath510.007% .",
    "although the statistical decay process from the @xmath1-hole state might contribute to produce the 15.1  mev state in @xmath7c , much more statistics of the data is needed to find out the signal of 15.1  mev @xmath0-ray .",
