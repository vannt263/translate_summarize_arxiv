    "the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies power spectrum ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) have presented cosmologists with the possibility of studying the large scale properties of our universe with unprecedented precision . as is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the structure of the theoretical cmb spectrum , given mainly by the relative positions and amplitude of the so - called acoustic peaks , is sensitive to several cosmological parameters .",
    "the existing cmb data sets are therefore being analyzed with increasing sophistication ( see @xcite and @xcite for important advancements ) in an attempt to measure the undetermined cosmological quantities .",
    "the most recent analyses of this kind ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) have revealed an outstanding agreement between the data and the inflationary predictions of a flat universe and of a primordial scale invariant spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations .",
    "furthermore , the cmb constraint on the amount of matter density in baryons @xmath2 is now in very good agreement with the independent constraints from standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) obtained from primordial deuterium ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and consistent within @xmath3-@xmath4 with those derived from the combined analysis of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xcite ) . finally , the detection of power around the expected third peak , on arc - minutes scales , provides a new and independent evidence for the presence of non - baryonic dark matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data therefore suggests that our present cosmological model represents a beautiful and elegant theory able to explain most of the observations .",
    "however , the cmb result relies on the assumption of a particular class of models , based on adiabatic , _ passive _ and _ coherent _ ( see @xcite ) primordial fluctuations , and cold dark matter . in the following we refer to this class of models as @xmath0-cold dark matter ( @xmath0-cdm ) .",
    "this weak point , shared by most of the current studies , should not be overlooked : it has been recently shown , for example , that the very legitimate inclusion of gravity waves ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) or isocurvature modes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) into the analysis can completely erase most of the constraints derived from cmb alone .    furthermore , since even more exotic modifications like quintessence ( @xcite ) , topological defects ( @xcite,@xcite ) , broken primordial scale invariances ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , extra dimensions ( @xcite ) or unknown systematics ( just to name a few ) can be in principle considered , one should be extremely cautious in making any definitive conclusion from the present cmb observations .",
    "it is therefore timely to investigate if the present cmb data are in complete agreement with the @xmath0-cdm scenario or if we are losing relevant scientific informations by restricting the current analysis to a subset of models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the present _ paper _ we check to what extent modifications to the standard @xmath0-cdm scenario are _ needed _ by current cmb observations with two complementary approaches : first",
    ", we provide a model - independent analysis by fitting the data with a phenomenological function and characterizing the observed multiple peaks .",
    "phenomenological fits have been extensively used in the past and recent cmb analyses ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis differs in two ways : we include the latest cmb data from the boomerang ( @xcite ) , vsae ( @xcite ) , acbar ( @xcite ) , and archeops ( @xcite ) experiments and we make use of a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) algorithm , which allows us to investigate a large number of parameter simultaneously ( @xmath1 in our case ) .",
    "we then compare the position , relative amplitude and width of the peaks with the same features expected in a @xmath7-parameters model template of @xmath0-cdm spectra . by doing a peak - by - peak comparison between the theory and the phenomenological fit which is based on a much wider set of parameters",
    ", we then verify in a systematic way the agreement with the standard theoretical expectations .    as a by - product of the analysis",
    ", we present a set of cosmological diagrams that directly translate , under the assumption of @xmath0-cdm , the constraints on the features in the spectrum into bounds on several cosmological parameters .",
    "these diagrams offer the opportunity of quick , by - eye , data to model comparison .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss the phenomenological representation of the power spectrum , the analysis method we used and the mcmc algorithm . in section",
    "iii we present our results .",
    "finally , in section iv , we discuss our conclusions .",
    "we model the multiple peaks in the cmb angular spectrum by the following function :    @xmath8    where , in our case , @xmath9 . in order to avoid degeneracy of overlapping gaussians , we parametrise the centers of the secondary gaussians as functions of the positions of the previous gaussians : @xmath10    we use this formula to make a phenomenological fit to the current cmb data , constraining the values of the @xmath1 parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    the use of gaussian - shaped function to describe the cmb spectrum is now becoming a standard method in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a major difference with respect to previous works is that we are using only one fitting function , varying all its parameters simultaneously , while in general peaks are characterized with one single function in different selected regions of the spectrum , in correspondence with the expected peaks .",
    "the advantage of a single fitting function is a better control of the correlations between the phenomenological parameters as we show in the next section where we report the values of the correlation matrix .",
    "recently , douspis and ferreira ( @xcite ) used a gaussian plus an oscillating function as a phenomenological model .",
    "the method used here is more general , in the sense that we allow independent amplitudes and widths of the secondary peaks as well as impose no periodicity .",
    "we use the cmb data as listed in table [ cmbdata ] , spanning the range @xmath14 .",
    "for all the experiments we use the publicly available window functions and correlations in order to compute the expected theoretical signal @xmath15 inside the bin .",
    "the likelihood for a given phenomenological model is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gaussian curvature of the likelihood matrix at the peak .",
    "when available , we use the lognormal approximation to the band - powers .",
    "we marginalize over the reported gaussian distributed calibration error for each experiment and we include the beam uncertainties by the analytical marginalization method presented in ( @xcite ) .",
    "we perform our analysis on @xmath18 different data sets : the full data set , the low - frequency ( lf ) data ( experiments that covered frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum of @xmath19 ghz and below ) and a high - frequency ( hf ) data ( frequencies higher than @xmath19 ghz )",
    ". the reasons of this choice are twofold : first , any discrepancy between the 2 analyses would hint towards the presence of undetermined foreground .",
    "secondly , this facilitates the comparison with future and soon to be released observed power spectra at `` low '' frequencies , like those expected from the map satellite .",
    "we test the stability of our result by including a set of older cmb experiments as reported in table [ cmbdata ] and we also check that our model contains no bias towards the presence of peaks by fitting a set of mock data from a spectrum ( see fig . [ flatfit ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we further investigate the consistency with @xmath0-cdm by considering phenomenological diagrams relating the relative amplitudes and positions of the peaks with variations in a specific physical parameter .",
    "in the @xmath0-cdm adiabatic scenario , two key parameters control the relative power between the first and second peaks : the physical baryon density @xmath2 and the primordial spectral index @xmath20 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "increasing @xmath2 enhances the odd - numbered peaks relative to the even - numbered ones , while increasing @xmath20 enhances the small - scale peaks relative to the ones at larger scales .",
    "in figure [ dt1dt2nsob ] we plot the values allowed in our model template ( restricted by a set of rather conservative cosmological constraints , see the caption ) for the relative amplitude @xmath21 as functions of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath20 .",
    "as expected , increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath2 ( @xmath20 ) increases @xmath21 .",
    "the region is very broad , mainly owing to the degeneracy between these two parameters .",
    "nevertheless , super - imposing the 1-@xmath4 phenomenological constraint on @xmath21 in the diagram provides interesting constraints .",
    "models with a value of the spectral index @xmath22 , which are not easily accommodated in most inflationary models ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) or in disagreement with the bbn constraint @xmath23 are in fact not favored by our model - independent fit . in that figure , we also plot the constraints obtained by fitting the cmb data with the models in the template .",
    "this reduces in a severe way the number of allowed @xmath0-cdm models .",
    "nevertheless , the result on relative amplitude of the peaks is completely consistent with the one derived by the phenomenological fit .",
    "this method provides better constraints on the amount of cold dark matter @xmath24 if we consider the relative amplitudes @xmath25 and @xmath26 as we do in the top and bottom panels of figure  [ dt1dt2dt3oc ] .",
    "a decrease in @xmath24 has the effect of decreasing the amplitude of the third peak ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as we can see , the two observational values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 provide similar constraints on @xmath24 in a non trivial way with @xmath27 and with @xmath28 or @xmath29 in disagreement with the data .    in a flat @xmath0-cdm model",
    "a variation in @xmath30 shifts the spectrum as @xmath31 with the shift parameter @xmath32 given by ( see @xcite , @xcite ) :    @xmath33^{-1/2 } dz}.\\ ] ]    varying the hubble constant , parametrized as @xmath34 km / sec / mpc , changes the scale of equality and produces a similar shift .",
    "these two parameters are related to the age of the universe by :    @xmath35^{-1/2 } } } dz}\\ ] ]    we can therefore expect that a determination of the peak positions provides constraints on these three quantities .    in figure",
    "[ l2l1age ] and figure [ l3l1age ] we plot similar diagrams as above for @xmath36 and @xmath37 as functions of @xmath30 , @xmath38 and age , @xmath39 . even if the region of the allowed models is quite broad because of the intrinsic degeneracies , the observed peak positions strongly favor a model with cosmological constant @xmath40 , a hubble parameter @xmath41 , compatible with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) result of @xmath42 ( @xcite ) , and an age @xmath43 gy , compatible with the age of the oldest globular clusters ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "again , the values obtained by the phenomenological fit are in agreement with those derived by the standard cmb+@xmath0-cdm analysis .",
    "another parameter that affects the position of the peaks is the spectral index @xmath20 .",
    "however , the effect is different , the shift being scale dependent",
    ". therefore , it is better to consider the quantities @xmath44 and @xmath45 which are unaffected by the overall shift @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are plotted in figure [ l1l2l3ns ] . as mentioned earlier , the observed values point towards a low value of the spectral index @xmath47 .",
    "in this _ paper _ we investigated the consistency of the most recent cmb data with a class of @xmath0-cdm adiabatic inflationary models .",
    "first we characterized the positions , amplitudes and widths of the peaks by fitting the data with simple phenomenological functions composed by several gaussians .",
    "the detection of the peak amplitudes and positions is quite robust and stable between different data sets .",
    "we found that all the features are consistent with those expected by the standard theory .",
    "we also examined where the data contains the most information in the power - angular scale plane .",
    "we found that the low frequency experiments provide good constraints at small angular scales , consistent with the expected damping tail , whereas high frequency experiments provide strong limits on the power at large and intermediate scales .",
    "we observe that hf experiments and lf experiments yield very consistent results , although lf data seems to provide evidence for higher secondary oscillations .",
    "overall , the power spectrum is now well determined until @xmath48 .",
    "the inclusion of older data does not affect our conclusions as they do not measure the power beyond @xmath49 .",
    "the relative amplitude of the first and second peak , in particular , of about @xmath50 is consistent with the baryon density expected from bbn and suggests a value of @xmath20 lower than one in the case of negligible reionization .",
    "the amplitudes of the third peak relative to the first and to the second , @xmath51 and @xmath52 strongly suggest the presence of cold dark matter but also limits time its contribution to values @xmath53 .",
    "the relative positions of the peaks , @xmath54 and @xmath55 is pointing towards the presence of a cosmological constant , a hubble parameter on the low side of the value allowed by the recent hst measurements ( @xmath56 ) and to an age of the universe @xmath57 gyrs consistent with the measurements of the oldest globular clusters .",
    "it is reassuring that all those conclusions , obtained by just drawing few lines in the diagrams presented in figs .",
    "@xmath58 , are in agreement with the results obtained by a more careful standard analysis . within the models considered in our database we found ( at @xmath59 c.l . ) : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 gyrs .",
    "the results obtained here show no need for modifications to the standard model , like gravity waves , quintessence , isocurvature modes , or extra - backgrounds of relativistic particles .",
    "furthermore , possible systematic effects due to unknown foregrounds or calibration and beam uncertainties are not immediately suggested , since the different data sets are consistent with the theory .",
    "even if the width of the gaussians is poorly constrained , we found supporting evidence for multiple oscillations in the data between @xmath65 . beyond that , the newest experimental results show a damping of the power .",
