    "the last decade has witnessed an enormous surge of interest in 2d semimetals , materials with a node in the electronic density of states ( dos ) where the valence and conduction bands touch .",
    "stoichiometrically , this band - touching point is also the position of the chemical potential in the undoped state .",
    "this undoped state is challenging to implement experimentally because of the two dimensional nature of these materials , which leads to oversize effects due to the environment ( e.g , the substrate ) .",
    "spectacular examples of such 2d semimetals are provided by graphene @xcite and the surface states of strong topological insulators ( sti ) @xcite , where the quasiparticles obey the @xmath0 dimensional 2-component dirac equation , thus exhibiting linear dispersion . since the dirac equation can have two opposite chiralities and",
    "the full lattice band structure should contain quasiparticles with the net chirality of all branches equal to zero , these quasiparticles are required to always come in pairs@xcite . in the cases of graphene and stis these pairs are well - separated , in momentum space and real space respectively .",
    "thus , under appropriate circumstances , their behavior may be understood as arising from the behavior of independent copies of @xmath0-d 2-component dirac fermions .",
    "an additional characteristic of these @xmath0-d quasiparticles is that there is a relatively easy route for converting them into massive gapped bands and so destroying the critical scale - free nature of the massless theory .",
    "this is accomplished by breaking , spontaneously or explicitly , the symmetry that protects the massless character . in graphene",
    "this is a combination of time reversal and inversion symmetries@xcite ; it is the time reversal symmetry in stis@xcite .    in recent years",
    "there have been exciting analogous proposals for observing similar phenomena in 3d semimetals@xcite . in this case",
    "the two component theory near the touching point of the conduction and valence bands is that of weyl fermions .",
    "the theory of these fermions may be obtained by setting the mass term for the relativistic 4-component dirac equation to zero , and then using one of the pair of decoupled two - component fermions with opposite chiralities that form the 4-component dirac spinor .",
    "after appropriate rotations and rescalings , the hamiltonian of the theory can always be recast as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the velocity , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 are the pauli spin matrices ) , @xmath5 is the deviation from the band touching point in momentum space , and the @xmath6 sign denotes the two possible chiralities allowed . in this case",
    ", since the hamiltonian is a hermitian @xmath7 matrix parametrized by three real numbers ( apart from an irrelevant shift in the zero energy ) , the three components of the momentum quench all degrees of freedom and the spectrum can not be gapped continuously at a single weyl point . also , since the weyl nodes occur in the bulk of a 3d material , they may be less susceptible to being doped by the environment , unlike the 2d dirac case where such undesired occurrence of ( inhomogeneous ) doping needs to be actively eliminated by challenging methods like the isolation of the material from its environment ( e.g. , suspended graphene ) or by sensitive chemical control ( e.g. , in stis ) . however ,",
    "weyl points must come in pairs of opposite handed - ness and scattering between different weyl points can destroy the weyl points , which can happen because of atomic scale disorder . in the absence of such atomic scale disorder ,",
    "a weyl point is stable and may be more accessible in the laboratory than a 2d gapless dirac theory if an appropriate material is found .",
    "another reason why these materials have garnered much interest is that they are expected to have topologically protected gapless surface states which are novel because they have discontinuous fermi surfaces ( fermi ` arcs')@xcite .",
    "these are related to the fact that depending on chirality , the node of the theory acts like a source or sink for the berry curvature flux@xcite .",
    "this leads the fermions to exhibit exotic behaviors like the chiral anomaly because of which in the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields particles are lost or created for weyl fermions of opposite chiralities@xcite .    as in the case of the 2d undoped dirac theory , the gapless critical nature of the weyl theory and the chiral nature of the quasiparticles give rise to unconventional features in their transport characteristics and this , in particular , has drawn much research interest@xcite .",
    "one aspect has been the effects due to the marginal nature of coulomb interaction in these theories@xcite .",
    "another aspect that attracted much attention in the context of 2d dirac materials was the possible absence of the anderson localization transition @xcite and the nature of associated phenomena , like weak localization effects@xcite .",
    "this discussion originated a couple of decades ago@xcite , when the effects of quenched disorder in undoped 2d dirac and 3d weyl theories were investigated for the cases where the symmetries protecting gaplessness were not broken .",
    "the effective coupling induced between the fermions in the replica picture was shown to be marginal in 2d but irrelevant in 3d , in the sense of the renormalization group .",
    "thus , the two theories ( @xmath8d and @xmath9d ) are affected very differently by disorder . in the 2d case",
    "the presence of a small amount of disorder generates , in a nonperturbative way , a finite dos at the dirac node ; consequently , the material becomes metallic . in the 3d weyl case , however , the nodal nature of the weyl point is preserved unless the disorder strength is larger than a critical value , and so the semimetal phase is stable .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the existence and idiosyncrasies of diffusive processes in the weyl semimetal , in the ` quantum critical ' regime , where the chemical potential is much smaller than the temperature .",
    "we do this for weak disorder , assumed to be of the ` potential ' type and slowly varying , so that there is no scattering between different weyl nodes which may gap the spectrum .",
    "choosing uncorrelated ` vector ' disorder ( i.e terms proportional to the pauli matrices in the hamiltonian ) is found to not change the underlying physics .",
    "its effect on diffusion in the isotropic random case will be shown to be a modification of the ratio of the transport to the quasiparticle lifetimes .",
    "unlike the case of the 2d dirac fermions , for which the effect of disorder on the nodal states is nonperturbative , in the case of the 3d weyl semimetal disorder is irrelevant and thus well - known perturbative techniques may be used@xcite . however , there are a handful of nuanced differences from the use of these methods for a conventional fermi gas .",
    "first , the scattering from potential disorder is highly anisotropic here and is characterized by a complete suppression of exact backscattering@xcite .",
    "this is dramatically different from the textbook example of a simple fermi gas and is known from the boltzmann approach , or the calculation of the renormalized uniform current vertex , to result in the transport lifetime replacing the state lifetime in the drude expression of the conductivity@xcite .",
    "however , this result has not been explicitly derived before for the density response function in the diagrammatic approach , which is used to calculate quantum effects beyond the boltzmann approach ( e.g. , weak localization ) .",
    "we shall reconcile these two approaches , demonstrating how to calculate the charge vertex renormalization in the ` conserving approximation'@xcite for disorder ( the ` diffuson ' ) , with an arbitrary anisotropic scattering amplitude .",
    "we thus show that the result obtained is consistent with the boltzmann picture .",
    "we find that for disorder with a potential character , the transport time is @xmath10 times the state lifetime ( equation  ) .",
    "the inclusion of isotropic vector disorder reduces this ratio to a number between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( equation  ) .",
    "the second characteristic of the diffusion process in weyl semimetals is that there is a node in the density of states ( dos ) at zero energy and the dos increases linearly with the energy . due to the node in the dos",
    ", the quasiparticle lifetime becomes infinite at the fermi level ( zero energy ) and one expects that at zero temperature transport will be ballistic ( however , we can naively expect it to be zero since the dos is zero at the node ) .",
    "the situation is quite different at a finite temperature @xmath12 for a sufficiently large sample .",
    "we argue that when the disorder is weak , the transport process may be modeled as diffusion by particle - hole pairs with an energy - dependent diffusion coefficient , which becomes smaller at higher energies .",
    "the contribution of these pairs to transport is , however , not uniform but proportional to the product of the dos and the slope of the fermi distribution function , which is greatly suppressed at energies less that @xmath12 ( see figure  [ fig - diffusingenergies ] ) . as a result",
    ", the contribution of the ballistic zero energy modes may be neglected self - consistently .",
    "the bulk of diffusive transport occurs via modes with excitation energies that are of the order of or greater than @xmath12 .",
    "since the quasiparticle lifetime is a decreasing function of energy , this means that the diffusive process kicks in for timescales larger than the state lifetime for quasiparticles at energy @xmath12 . also , since higher energy quasiparticles have a smaller diffusion coefficient and diffuse slowly , this combined diffusive process",
    "is shown to result in diffusive relaxation of particle density , which is qualitatively different from and slower than what we obtain for a diffusive process with a single diffusion coefficient .",
    "while the latter ( conventional ) process exhibits relaxation that exponentially decays in the time @xmath13 , in a weyl semimetal the relaxation process is exponential in @xmath14  a stretched exponential in @xmath13 .",
    "hence it is much slower ( equations and ; figures  [ fig - chargevstime ] and [ fig - chargeresponsevstime ] ) .",
    "a process such as this is described by diffusion with a memory function@xcite which decays slowly .",
    "there does not exist a well - defined timescale beyond which it may be neglected .",
    "the energy and time scales involved in weyl diffusion are summarized in figure  [ fig - energyscales ] .",
    "a consequence of the finite temperature diffusion is that the weyl semimetal has a finite dc conductance , which at zero temperature may naively be expected to be zero , since the dos is zero at the fermi point .",
    "this finite temperature dc conductance , obtained when only impurity scattering is present , has been derived previously , except for the crucial substitution of the transport lifetime by the quasiparticle lifetime .",
    "this requires the gauge invariance abiding current vertex renormalization , which was ignored in those works .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the phenomenon of diffusion in the presence of a general memory function , in section  [ sec - diffusionintro ] .",
    "we then explain our technique for treating the case of quenched disorder with anisotropic scattering when calculating the density vertex renormalization in the diffuson approximation , in section  [ sec - anisotropicmethod ] .",
    "proceeding to the case of weyl semimetals in section  [ sec - weyldiffusion ] , we first calculate the electron self energy in the self consistent born approximation ( scba ) and show that it predicts a semimetal to metal phase transition , as disorder strength is increased@xcite .",
    "we subsequently only consider the case of weak disorder when the born approximation is sufficient .",
    "the density response function is then calculated using the techniques from the previous section , following which we elaborate on the idiosyncrasies arising from the nodal nature and the strong variation of the dos with energy .",
    "we conclude this section with a phenomenological model of diffusion where independently diffusing thermally excited quasiparticles with an energy - dependent diffusion coefficient and show that it is equivalent to the results obtained for the weyl semimetal , thus clarifying the physical picture that is presented in this paper . in section  [ sec - leftover ]",
    "we comment on the dc conductivity in weyl semimetals and the roles of vector disorder and coulomb interactions . in conclusion",
    ", we propose an experiment ( see figure  [ fig - exptsetup ] ) using currently available techniques to observe this novel slow diffusive relaxation when a weyl semimetal is found or fabricated in the laboratory .",
    "diffusion is a consequence of particle number conservation .",
    "the rate of change of the number density is , to the first approximation , related linearly to its history via a diffusion memory function@xcite @xmath15 ( assuming space and time translation invariance on the average ; we shall always work in the reciprocal @xmath16-space ) : @xmath17 the local nature of the underlying microscopic theory , in combination with the conserved nature of particle number , ensures that @xmath18 as @xmath19 . for long enough timescales when all low frequency ` reactive ' modes are damped out and the system enters the ` diffusive ' regime , @xmath20 as @xmath19 .",

    "before embarking on finding the diffusion mechanism in weyl semimetals , we shall take a detour and calculate the charge density response in an electron gas in the presence of random potential disorder , when the scattering amplitude is _ anisotropic _ ,",
    "i.e , varies with the angle between incoming and outgoing momenta .",
    "it is well known from the boltzmann transport equation approach or a diagrammatic calculation of the renormalized uniform current vertex that this changes the appropriate microscopic timescale entering the diffusion process from the quantum state lifetime @xmath46 to the transport lifetime @xmath47 , both of which are defined in equations   and below . since the diagrammatic method is used for deriving quantum corrections to the boltzmann result ( like weak localization ) it is useful to be able to treat the case of anisotropic scattering in this framework also . even though this seems to be fundamental enough to have been derived before , we found the research literature to be lacking in this respect and shall derive the procedure in this section .",
    "we first recount the well - known procedure to obtain the single particle green s function in the presence of a static disorder potential @xmath49 , which has zero mean ( @xmath50 ) and satisfies the ` white noise ' criterion at long enough length scales : @xmath51 here @xmath52 denotes averaging over different realizations of disorder . as an example , if we consider a density @xmath53 of random short range potential wells @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the spatial dimension , then we can show that @xmath58",

    "this is true , for example , in the cases of dirac or weyl fermions , the latter of which we shall consider in the next section . in that case we can assume the following general form for the disorder - averaged squared magnitude of the scattering amplitude involving states at similar energies : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total volume . ] .",
    "we shall assume for our purposes that the dependence on @xmath64 is mild ( defined by a relation analogous to ) and the above form will be substituted in place of the impurity - correlation potential denoted by the starred vertex dashed line in feynman diagrams .",
    "the disorder - averaged retarded / advanced electronic self energy @xmath65 is calculated , in the born approximation , by the feynman diagram shown in figure  [ fig - selfenergyborn ] .",

    "this is justified only when the impurity scattering is independent of the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta .",
    "because of this , past calculations involving the vertex renormalization have failed to distinguish between the transport lifetime and state lifetime , and can not be applied to the cases of dirac and weyl fermions without invoking the boltzmann transport equation .    in order to solve equation",

    "has not been included in figure  [ fig - chargevstime ] . ]",
    "+      equations   will now be derived from a simple phenomenological model of weyl fermion quasiparticles , with particles at different energies diffusing independently with an energy - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath231 .",
    "this clarifies the physical picture of the unconventional behavior uncovered in the past few subsections .",
    "denoting the density of particles at energy @xmath64 by the quantity @xmath232 , we should have @xmath233 at @xmath30 , we shall assume thermal equilibrium in the presence of a frozen fluctuation @xmath234 in the chemical potential .",
    "in that case @xmath235 and also @xmath236 following the discussion surrounding figure  [ fig - diffusingenergies ] , we see that @xmath237 is negligible for @xmath238 and thus we should disregard them in the discussion below .",
    "now , we shall relax the chemical potential to the constant equilibrium value and calculate the diffusive process by which the numbers relax to their equilibrium ( zero ) values . using equation",
    ", @xmath239 thus , using equation  , the total density response is @xmath240 and so @xmath241 finally , using equations   and , @xmath242 which is identical to equation   and proves the applicability of this simple picture to the previous results of this section .",
    "we conclude the main body of this paper with comments about the conductivity of disordered weyl semimetals at finite temperature and the effects of including isotropic ` vector ' disorder , i.e , disorder terms proportional to the pauli matrices in , assuming rotational isotropy .      using the continuity equation @xmath243",
    ", the ( longitudinal ) conductivity @xmath244 may be related to the density response function @xmath245 : @xmath246 in the diffusing limit @xmath247 , we can use to obtain @xmath248 taking the limit @xmath249 and then @xmath250 , we arrive at the dc conductivity @xmath251 where the planck s constant @xmath252 has been restored and the result is re - expressed in terms of @xmath253 defined in .",
    "this answer is equivalent to earlier results@xcite , but with the correct numerical factors@xcite and the renormalization of the current vertex@xcite , equal to the ratio @xmath254 .",
    "in addition , for small @xmath255 the diffusive component of the conductivity decreases from its dc value by a term proportional to @xmath256 , as has been obtained previously@xcite ( but without using the conserving approximation or taking into account the diffusive - ballistic crossover ) .",
    "this arises due to the @xmath257 behavior of the lower limit of the @xmath186 integral in , below which ballistic transport occurs .",
    "however , in this energy range the calculations need to incorporate the diffusive - ballistic transition accurately , as well as inter - band scattering processes in order to correctly obtain the coefficient of this @xmath256 term .",
    "in addition to the usual ` potential ' disorder term @xmath258 , we can also include ` vector ' disorder in the weyl theory   @xmath259 we assume ` white ' noise disorder with rotational symmetry restored on the average , which means that @xmath260 and also that this ` vector ' disorder is uncorrelated with the ` potential ' disorder on the average @xmath261 . with these assumptions",
    ", we can show that the net effect is to change the effective interaction induced by disorder , equation  , to the form @xmath262 this means that depending on the relative strengths of the two kinds of disorder , we have @xmath263 and so @xmath264 apart from this modification the rest of the physics is the same as when only ` potential ' disorder is present .      unlike short range quenched disorder which is an irrelevant perturbation to the weyl theory , long range instantaneous coulomb interaction is a marginal perturbation and results in strong electron - electron scattering ( including inelastic processes ) as the temperature is decreased .",
    "this phenomenon can be approximately treated using the quantum boltzmann equation and shows that the conductivity goes to zero as @xmath265@xcite .",
    "thus , in the presence of coulomb interactions , our results for quenched disorder limited transport hold only for high enough temperatures , when the coulomb scattering may be neglected in comparison to that due to quenched disorder .",
    "in this paper , we have initially introduced the formalism required to compute correctly the renormalized charge vertex , in the diffuson approximation , in the presence of disorder with an anisotropic scattering amplitude .",
    "we have then used this to study the case of weyl fermions in the presence of quenched disorder in the quantum critical regime when the chemical potential is small compared to the temperature .",
    "these quasiparticles exhibit anisotropic scattering and their dos varies sharply with energy near the fermi point .",
    "the anisotropic scattering results in the transport timescale being the relevant quantity in the diffusion parameter , the quantum critical nature of the problem results in temperature being the only low energy scale in the theory and the sharp linear increase of the dos leads to a very slow unconventional diffusion process characterized by a memory function which does not have a sharp upper limit on the timescales involved .    when a weyl semimetal is found in the laboratory , this novel slow diffusive relaxation may be observed as a test of our theory .",
    "the experimental setup would involve preparing a sample of the weyl semimetal with a frozen long - wavelength excess charge modulation at @xmath30 induced by , say , a backgate arrangement that is electrically insulated from the sample , as shown schematically in figure  [ fig - exptsetup ] .",
    "the backgate is then grounded and the induced charge is allowed to relax to the steady state uniform distribution .",
    "the amount of charge present at a given time may be sensed using , say , a sensitive set charge probe@xcite . the relaxation of charge is then predicted to follow the slow process shown in figure  [ fig - chargevstime ] , with the value of @xmath103 being provided by the inverse wavelength of the induced charge modulation , which may be tuned by changing the separation between the backgates .",
    "the initial decay may , however , turn out to be much faster in the experiment , due to charge diffusion along the surface fermi ` arcs ' .",
