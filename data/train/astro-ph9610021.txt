    "narrow emission lines from  were first seen with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( ) satellite in 1987 may ( fransson et al . 1989 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the lines detected were 1239 , 1243 , 1486 , 1640 , 1661 , 1667 , 1747 - 1754 , and 1907 , 1909 .",
    "the absence of the usually strong 1400 and 1550 resonance lines can be attributed to absorption of these transitions by the same ions in hot interstellar gas in the lmc .",
    "the presence of  in the  spectra , on the other hand , is in fact an indication that there is a negligible column density of interstellar  in the lmc .",
    "a remarkable feature of the early observations of  was that the , , and  lines increased in flux linearly with time .",
    "the , , and  lines were weak and it was difficult to say anything conclusive about their light curves .",
    "the increase in the fluxes stopped just after the last observations discussed in paper i , @xmath9 days after explosion .",
    "subsequent observations showed that the , , and  lines reached a maximum @xmath10 days after the explosion ( sonneborn et al .",
    "1988 ) . after this epoch",
    "the observations reported in this paper show a steady decay of the lines .",
    "earlier versions of the emission line light curves , but not the new measurements discussed in this paper , have been presented by us in several papers ( sonneborn et al . 1990 ; panagia et al .",
    "1991 ; sonneborn 1991 ) and an independent analysis by sanz fernndez de crdoba ( 1993 ) . preliminary versions of some of the new light curves have been shown by fransson & sonneborn ( 1994 ) and plait et al .",

    "they found good agreement with uv continuum observations of sn1987a with _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( ) and ground - based photometry where they overlap .",
    "the presence and temporal development of these highly ionized lines have been explained as a result of recombination , cooling and light echo effects ( lundqvist & fransson 1987 ; chevalier 1988 ; paper i ; lundqvist & fransson 1991 , henceforth lf91 ) .",
    "the initial pulse of soft x - rays accompanying the breakout of the shock wave ionizes the circumstellar gas expelled by the progenitor star .",
    "as the outburst evolves an increasingly large volume of the ionized gas becomes visible because of light travel - time effects .",
    "if the recombination time is long compared to the epoch of observation , the observed flux is expected to grow in proportion to the emitting volume within the light echo paraboloid . for a non - recombining ion emitting at constant temperature",
    "this leads to a flux increasing monotonically with time , until the whole structure is within the light echo paraboloid . in reality , the temperature and ionization decrease with time , causing the evolution to become highly complicated .",
    "detailed modelling of the early line emission showed that the peak radiation temperature at the time of the breakout was between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( fransson & lundqvist 1989 ; lundqvist 1991 ) . a subsequent analysis , taking",
    "the ring geometry into account , resulted in a peak radiation temperature in excess of @xmath13 ( lundqvist & fransson 1996 , henceforth lf96 ) .",

    "abundance ratios of n / c @xmath14 and n / o @xmath15 , by number , found in paper i strongly suggest cno enriched gas . this has proven to be one of the main observational constraints on the progenitor evolution ( e.g. , saio , nomoto , & kato 1988 ; woosley 1988",

    "these structures were also seen in optical continuum , indicating the presence of time - delayed reflections by dust .",
    "imaging with the new technology telescope resolved the inner emission region of radius @xmath17 and several outer structures ( wampler et al .",

    "images in [ 4959 , 5007 ( jakobsen et al . 1991 , 1994 ; plait et al . 1995 ) revealed the now well - known thin ring geometry of the inner region , rather than a spherical shell as had been previously hypothesized .",
    "further observations showed that the outer structures are concentrated mainly to two off - center rings , which extend @xmath18 to the north and south of the supernova ( burrows et al .",
    "crotts , kunkel , & heathcote ( 1995 ) show that the toroidal geometry extends also to regions of the circumstellar medium exterior to the ring , and that there may be some connection between the inner and outer rings .",
    "they also find that the inner ring is circular to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "in addition to the geometry , the dynamics and origin of the inner ring is severely constrained by the emission line widths . in paper i",
    "we showed that the 1907 , 1909 lines were very narrow @xmath19 and unshifted with respect to the lmc ism toward the supernova @xmath20 .",
    "crotts & heathcote ( 1991 ) and cumming et al . (",

    "they , as well as wood & faulkner ( 1987 ) and meikle et al .",

    "prompt radio emission from , the result of shock interaction with the progenitor s stellar wind close to the photosphere , was observed during the first few days after explosion ( turtle et al .",
    "this emission decayed away after the first week .",
    "however , around day 1200 there was a revival of the radio emission and a steady increase in the flux was observed ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 ) which continued through day 2750 ( ball et al .",
    "chevalier ( 1992 ) and duffy , ball , & kirk ( 1995 ) attribute the resurgence of the radio emission from  to the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the density enhancement expected at the position of the termination shock in the blue supergiant wind of the progenitor .",
    "further evidence of circumstellar interaction is the increasing late - time x - ray emission observed by rosat ( beuermann , brandt , & pietsch 1994 ; gorenstein , hughes , & tucker 1994 ; hasinger , aschenbach , & trmper 1996 ) .",
    "chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) point out that the density of the shocked blue supergiant wind is insufficient to explain the late radio and x - ray fluxes , as well as the apparent slowing down of the supernova shock ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "they propose that the supernova shock is now moving into the denser ( @xmath22 ) shocked red supergiant wind which was ionized by the progenitor .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the complete set of uv emission lines in   derived from low and high dispersion swp spectra from the explosion up to 1992 april 20 ( day 1882 ) . a new method of analysis has allowed us to reduce systematic and random errors in the line measurements compared to paper i and the light curves of panagia et al .",

    "2 we discuss the observations , in  3 the measurements of the line fluxes , and in  4 the main observational results are given .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion (  5 ) of ring geometry , abundances , density , emitting mass , and comparison with existing ring models in light of the observational data .",
    "the ultraviolet spectra presented in this paper were obtained with the swp camera between 1987 march 14 and 1992 april 20 .",
    "all spectra were taken in the @xmath23 short wavelength large aperture ( swla ) , the minor axis of which is approximately parallel with the spectrograph s dispersion direction .",
    "the unique characteristics of the  field demanded special care during the acquisition process to ensure accurate target centering in the swla , as discussed below .",
    "the observations were carried out at both observatories , located at nasa / goddard space flight center and esa s villafranca ground station ( vilspa ) .",
    "the swp image number , time of observation , and exposure duration for each low dispersion spectrum are listed in table 1 .",
    "the observation date refers to the starting time of the exposure , expressed in days after outburst . the outburst time is assumed to be that of the imb neutrino detection ( 1987 february 23.316 ut , bionta et al .",
    "1987 ) .    twenty swp high dispersion spectra of  were obtained during the uv emission line phase @xmath24 days . these observations and their analysis",
    "are discussed below in  4.4 .",
    "following the rapid decrease of the supernova s uv flux shortward of 2000   in the first week of the outburst , the continua of two early - type stars appeared in swla spectra of  ( kirshner et al .",
    "the identification of the progenitor hinged on close scrutiny of these two previously unknown stars in the lmc located within arc seconds of the supernova s position .",
    "analysis of their spatial separation in swp low - dispersion spectra taken several weeks after outburst showed that sk @xmath25 had disappeared ( gilmozzi et al .",
    "1987 ; sonneborn , altner , & kirshner 1987 ) .",
    "these same two stars , referred to as star 2 and star 3 , after their position in the tabulation of west et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , have dominated uv flux in swp large aperture exposures of  since 1987 march .",
    "stars 2 and 3 are offset from  by 291 ( p.a .",
    "318 ) and 163 ( p.a .",
    "118 ) , respectively , as measured in recent wfpc2 images ( romaniello , 1996 , private communication .",
    "these updated positions are within the measurement errors of walborn et al .",
    "( 1987 ) .",
    "several known sources contribute to the observed spectrum in the large aperture exposures taken at the position of .",
    "in addition to the supernova , there is the emission from circumstellar material ( the subject of this paper ) , the continua of stars 2 and 3 , and a very faint star located about 9   from  which enters the end of the swla every six months when the aperture has the appropriate orientation .",
    "these contributions were taken into account in the measurement of emission line strengths .",
    "stars 2 and 3 are the most important secondary sources for purposes of this paper .",
    "the shape of emission lines and supernova continuum are affected by the detailed structure of the combined stellar spectra .",
    "correcting the observed swp spectrum requires more than the subtraction of a stellar background spectrum . by virtue of its location near the south ecliptic pole ,",
    "the lmc is observable 365 days per year and the position angle of the large aperture changes by about one degree per day . as the orientation of the swla rotates on the sky during the year",
    ", the projection of stars 2 and 3 on to the spectrograph dispersion axis also varies .",
    "stars 2 and 3 appear to rotate about the supernova s position ( relative to the aperture ) and their projection onto the direction of spectral dispersion has a 365-day periodicity .",
    "the spatial separation ( 45 ) corresponds to @xmath26 ( @xmath277  ) when the stars are aligned parallel to the dispersion direction .",
    "the principal spectral features in the stellar spectra shift in wavelength because star 2 contributes about 70% of their combined flux below 2000  .",
    "accurate centering of the supernova in the swla was necessary in order to obtain reliable emission line light curves . during the time interval spanning the observations ,  covered over 13 magnitudes of visual brightness",
    "the fine error sensor ( fes ) was used to acquire the supernova , providing position measurements of its center of light from day 1 ( v@xmath28 ) , through visual maximum ( day 86 , v@xmath29 ) , and up to day @xmath30 ( v@xmath31 ) . after that time",
    "the supernova was acquired as a blind offset from the nearby star sk @xmath32 , 1385 almost due n of  ( p.a.=263 ) .",
    "the coordinates ( b1950.0 ) used for the blind offset maneuver are @xmath33 488 , @xmath34 for sk @xmath35 and @xmath36 500 , @xmath37 for .",
    "the offset maneuver was tested and calibrated between days 700 and 850 when  was still bright enough ( @xmath38 ) to directly acquire it with the fes .",
    "the measured maneuver errors on these occasions were @xmath39 fes unit in each axis , or @xmath4003 total pointing error on the plane of the sky .",
    "we therefore believe that there were negligible differences in aperture centering over the five years of the observations which might affect the emission line spectrophotometry .",
    "the procedures used to measure the emission line strengths in low dispersion spectra are described in this section .",
    "all line fluxes were measured relative to the net supernova spectrum , that is the observed spectrum with the contribution of stars 2 and 3 subtracted .",
    "this procedure , which in principle is the same as used in paper i , assumes that the relative contributions of stars 2 and 3 to the observed spectrum are constant .",
    "this will be true in general provided that the supernova is centered in the swla so that both stars are also in the aperture and that the stars themselves are not highly variable in the ultraviolet .",
    "this last point is addressed in  4.1 .",
    "the principal steps in this process are outlined below .",
    "our analysis uses the spatially resolved spectra from the extended line - by - line ( elbl ) data files produced by the standard iuesips processing ( turnrose & thompson 1984 , as updated by munoz piero 1985 for elbl processing ) .",
    "the elbl file is a two - dimensional spectral image extracted from the photometrically corrected image along lines of constant wavelength . for the swp camera it contains about 700 points in the wavelength domain ( 11501980 , @xmath41 / pixel ) and 110 points in the spatial dimension ( 068 per linear pixel ) .",
    "specialized interactive software was written to correct elbl pixels corrupted by energetic particle hits and bright spots .",
    "for each image the area inside the extraction slit and in the background areas were inspected for bright spots and cosmic ray effects . when found in the background extraction slit , corrupted pixels",
    "were replaced with with data values corresponding to the average of immediately adjacent pixels .",
    "extreme care was exercised when correcting bright spots close to the spectrum .",
    "within the extraction slit bright spots were replaced with the average of part of a single row of pixels ( parallel to the dispersion ) at the same distance above or below the dispersion line .",
    "the spectrum was extracted from the corrected image using a rectangular extraction slit , similar to the standard iuesips extraction procedure described by turnrose & thompson ( 1984 ) .",
    "the spatial height of the rectangular spectral extraction slit for the sn 1987a spectrum was 24 lines ( 16 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the iuesips standard slit heights are 18 and 30 lines for point source and extended source extractions , respectively .",
    "the extraction slit height of 24 lines was chosen to include the wings of the point spread function of stars 2 and 3 at their maximum spatial separation in the spectrograph format , i.e. , when their position angle was perpendicular to the dispersion direction .",
    "the customized slit height minimizes the background contribution to the extracted spectrum .",
    "the standard point source extraction slit is too short while the standard extended source extraction slit is longer than necessary .",
    "use of a slit - weighted extraction technique , such as optimal ( kinney et al .",
    "1991 ) was not used because of the variable , non - point - source nature of these spectra .",
    "the extracted spectra were corrected for two calibration changes .",
    "first , a secular shift in the wavelength scale between 1984 and 1988 , and second the long - term decline in swp sensitivity . starting in 1984 a systematic error developed in the swp low dispersion wavelength scale and grew linearly with time .",
    "the error resulted from a slow divergence of true dispersion relation from the extrapolation of the mean time - dependent dispersion constants .",
    "new dispersion constants were implemented in iuesips in 1988 april at gsfc and 1988 september at vilspa ( thompson 1988 ) .",
    "the swp low dispersion spectra processed between 1987 february and 1988 september contained an error in the wavelength calibration amounting to @xmath42   .",
    "thompson ( 1988 ) provided an algorithm to fit the time - dependent error in the wavelength scale .",
    "this relation was used to correct all swp low dispersion spectra of  effected by this calibration change .",
    "long - term changes in the sensitivity of the instrument were compensated for by using the correction scheme of garhart ( 1992a ) . between 1225 and 2000  ",
    "the swp low dispersion sensitivity has decreased linearly since 1979.5 at wavelength - dependent rates of @xmath43% to @xmath44% per year .",
    "the garhart sensitivity correction method gives results similar to bohlin & grillmair ( 1986 ) for the period in which they overlap .",
    "the extracted fluxes were also corrected for the temperature dependence of the swp camera response ( @xmath45% per c , garhart 1992b ) .",
    "finally , the spectral fluxes were placed on the absolute flux scale using the 1980 absolute calibration ( bohlin & holm 1980 ) .",
    "there was a period of a few weeks in 1987 when the swp large aperture spectrum of  was due almost entirely to stars 2 and 3 .",
    "this occurred between mid - march and early april , before the emission lines appeared .",
    "the swp large aperture spectra taken during this period were examined to determine which ones could be combined to form a reference spectrum of stars 2 and 3 .",
    "criteria included no overexposure , good signal - to - noise at wavelengths shortward of 1500    ( i.e. , @xmath46min ) , and no apparent signal from , particularly longward of 1800   .",
    "three spectra were selected : swp 30592 ( day 27.3 , @xmath47 min ) , swp 30637 ( day 33.1 , @xmath48 min ) , and swp 30743 ( day 44.2 , @xmath49 min ) .",
    "these spectra were reduced in the same manner described in  3.1 .",
    "swp 30637 and 30743 were registered in wavelength with respect to swp 30592 by cross correlation .",
    "the mean spectrum is the average of the three weighted by the individual exposure times .",
    "the resulting swp spectrum of stars 2 and 3 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "this spectrum is similar , though not identical , to that used by pun et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for their study the uv continuum properties of the  outburst .",
    "they derived their star 2 and 3 uv spectrum by averaging _",
    "late_-time spectra ( @xmath50 days ) , when the emission lines were extremely weak , in order to recover the uv spectrum of the supernova early in the outburst . in contrast , we use _",
    "early_-time spectra for stars 2 and 3 , before the emission lines appear , so that we can follow the decline of the emission lines at late times .",
    "our spectrum of stars 2 and 3 is in good agreement with the fos spectrum of star 2 ( fig 1 of scuderi et al .",
    "1996 ) , given the differences in spectral resolution and calibration between the two instruments .",
    "star 2 contributes @xmath2770% of the flux in this wavelength region .",
    "subtraction of the reference spectrum of stars 2 and 3 from the observed spectrum requires that the two wavelength scales be registered to correct for any offset .",
    "such a wavelength shift could be due to either an offset in the center of light from the center of the swla or a shift in the spectral features of stars 2 and 3 in the observed spectrum . in the case of the former ,",
    "a 10 pointing error in the dispersion direction corresponds to a spectral shift of @xmath51 , or @xmath52   .",
    "the wavelength shift required to properly align stars 2 and 3 with the observed spectrum was computed with an interactive cross - correlation program from the nasa / gsfc data analysis center software library .",
    "figure 2 shows two swp spectra with aperture position angles differing by 156 .",
    "the shifts in the observed spectra , relative to the reference spectrum of stars 2 and 3 , are evident , as is the difference in the widths in the strong stellar lines .",
    "relative to the reference spectrum , the spectra are shifted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as determined by the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "figure 3 shows the wavelength registration shifts for the swp data set ( table 1 ) .",
    "there is a @xmath55 year periodicity in the data , indicating that the position of stars 2 and 3 relative to the spectrograph - aperture geometry is a major source of this variation . within about @xmath4005 ( @xmath56 )",
    "the wavelength registration shifts are dominated by target acquisition and pointing errors .",
    "the net spectrum is computed by subtracting stars 2 and 3 from each observed spectrum after shifting the spectrum of stars 2 and 3 by the amount determined by the cross correlation and interpolating it to the wavelength scale of the observed spectrum .",
    "the flux in each emission line was measured in the net spectrum where local continuum determination is simplified for most of the emission lines of interest .",
    "the subtraction of stars 2 and 3 removes strong stellar and interstellar absorption features , including 1260 , 1300 , 1335 , and 1670 .",
    "the wavelengths defining the center and red and blue edges of each line in each spectrum were determined interactively . after subtracting stars 2 and 3",
    "the local continuum was assumed to be flat , except where the sn uv flux is strong .",
    "the latter is confined to @xmath57    and @xmath58 days .",
    "the line strength was integrated by a trapezoid algorithm .",
    "an example is shown in figure 4 where the observed and net spectra near the  line in swp 36801 ( day 894 ) are shown on the same flux scale . the  line is easily distinguished in the net spectrum .",
    "table 1 contains the fluxes for the 1240 , 1486 , 1640 , 1665 , 1750 , and 1908 lines measured in 119 spectra taken on 106 dates .",
    "the @xmath59     history of  between days 85 and 1820 is shown in figure 5 where the observed net fluxes have been averaged into nine time intervals .",
    "the development of the six emission lines is clearly seen .",
    "in addition to these emission lines , other features are evident in the net spectra .",
    "the supernova continuum longward of 1700    is prominent until day @xmath60 ( see also pun et al .",
    "there are additional features which rise and fall in the same time period between 1280 and 1540   .",
    "of particular interest is the narrow feature at 1400   , which we tentatively identify with 1397 - 1407 .",
    "although we have no identifications for the other features in the spectra , they are believed to be part of the blanketed continuum of the supernova .",
    "the formation of such `` pseudo - emission '' features in the early spectra of  is discussed by cassatella et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and lucy ( 1987 ) and at late times by fransson ( 1994 ) and li & mccray ( 1996 ) .",
    "local maxima occur where line blocking is less important and the photons can escape , i.e. , at wavelengths where there are gaps in the list of strong lines .",
    "similar pseudo - emission features occur in classical novae .",

    "( 1994 ) modelled and discussed the formation and evolution of these features in nova cygni 1992 .    the resulting light curves for the , , , , , and   lines are shown in figure 6 .",
    "the light curves show the observed line fluxes , without correction for interstellar extinction ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "it was sometimes difficult to determine the continuum level at the base of the  emission line , even after subtracting stars 2 and 3 , because of the uv flux from the supernova debris increased in this region of the spectrum ( see fig .",
    "a check of the accuracy of the low dispersion  flux measurements was made by comparing them with  fluxes from high resolution observations where continuum determination relative to the narrow emission is much easier .",
    "the high dispersion data for  are discussed below (  4.4 ) and the corresponding  fluxes also shown in figure 6d . the good agreement between these independent measurements ,",
    "well within the scatter of the low resolution data , illustrates the overall accuracy of the continuum determination .",
    "the new emission line light curves are clearly superior to those published previously ( paper i , sonneborn et al .",
    "1990 , panagia et al .",
    "1991 , and sanz fernndez de crdoba ( 1993 ) and may effect results derived from them , for example gould ( 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "the size of the large aperture prompts us to consider the degree to which emission from the outer rings might contribute to the uv light curves , particularly at early times ( say , @xmath61 days ) . if one adopts the geometry suggested by burrows et al .",
    "( 1995 ) the rising branch of the light curve of the southern outer ring ( sor ) should extend from about one month after explosion to about three years later , whereas the northern outer ring ( nor ) should have become visible about two years after outburst . in this geometry",
    "the nor would not have been entirely visible in the earliest images ( crotts , kunkel , & mccarthy 1989 ) but may have been `` complete '' by late 1989 in the eso images ( wampler et al .",
    "the uv light curves do show a weak secondary maximum around 1000 days , consistent with the epoch when both outer rings would have reached their maximum emission ( panagia et al .",
    "1996 , in preparation ) .",
    "therefore , emission from the nor would not contribute to the early observations , and emission from the sor would have contributed less than 1/3 of its total strength .",
    "present day imaging shows that the nor , the sor and the inner ring have comparable total emission in optical lines . however , the average density in the inner ring is higher than that in the outer rings so the time decay of the inner ring emission would be faster than that of the outer rings . as a consequence , the total emission of the inner ring at the time of its maximum must have been considerably higher than that of the outer rings combined .",
    "in fact , eso observations around the time of the tentative secondary maximum show that the outer rings contribute less than 10% of the total [ emission ( j. wampler & l. wang 1992 , private communication ) .",
    "we therefore believe that the contribution of the outer rings to the emission line light curves is negligible .",
    "figure 4 shows that the subtraction of stars 2 and 3 is not perfect . due to fixed - pattern and other small - scale noise , the scatter in the net spectrum near the emission line limits the accuracy of continuum subtraction , and hence the significance of short - term fluctuations in the emission line light curves .",
    "the accuracy of the continuum subtraction is quantified by the parameter @xmath62 , the local continuum residual ( eqn .",
    "1 ) , which is the difference between the net spectrum and the adopted local continuum , averaged over a bandpass comparable to the width of the emission line , @xmath63 @xmath62 was measured near the  line because the adjacent continua of stars 2 and 3 have strong stellar and interstellar features , which if not subtracted accurately will add significant and erroneous structure to the net spectrum .",
    "perfect continuum subtraction would yield @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath62 was computed in a bandpass centered at 1262    with a full width of 10   , the characteristic width of the  emission line at zero intensity .",
    "figure 7 shows the  light curve ( same data as fig .",
    "6a ) and @xmath62 .",
    "the error bar @xmath65 corresponds to the measurement uncertainty of individual data points for the six emission lines , indicating that the continuum subtraction procedure works well over the entire 5-year span of the data set .",
    "the accuracy of the continuum subtraction is insensitive to the known variability of the two stars .",
    "first , a change in the continuum flux results in a vertical shift of the net spectrum .",
    "the continuum in the net spectrum is constant ( i.e. horizontal in fig .",
    "4 ) , except in the presence of the strong sn continuum , so that the emission line is measured relative to this shifted continuum level . second , it is now well established that only star 3 , a be star , shows any significant variability .",

    "( 1993 ) showed that star 3 has photometric variability ranging from @xmath66 mag in @xmath67 to @xmath68 mag in @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "since star 3 contributes only @xmath71% of the uv flux , this level of variability is within the measured value of @xmath72 .",
    "the measurement uncertainty of the line fluxes implies that the significant short - term fluctuations in the light curves are astrophysical in origin , and are not instrumental effects . the increased scatter in the  and  light curves between day 900 and 1100 , in the  line before day 400 , and the large values of  and  near maximum are actual fluctuations in the emission line fluxes .",
    "we find no evidence that these spectra are affected by cosmic ray hits or other spurious effects and conclude that the fluctuations are real .",
    "the largest  flux point ( day 485 ) remains suspect , however , as it occurs significantly after maximum brightness and there is no related response in the other lines .",
    "the times when the lines first appear and when they reach maximum brightness are two important light curve parameters used to estimate the size and inclination of the ring . with a circular ring geometry",
    "the emission lines are expected to appear suddenly as the light echo paraboloid makes first contact with the ring ( dwek & felten 1992 ) . in general , the highest ionization stage available should be used to measure these parameters .",
    "it is evident from figure 6 that the six uv lines reach maximum at approximately the same time .",
    "however , only the  and  lines have large fluxes and well - defined maxima necessary for a more quantitative analysis .",
    "the actual times of maxima are @xmath73 and @xmath74 days ( @xmath75 days if the high data point at day 485 is excluded ) , as determined by high - order polynomial fits to the light curves .",
    "comparison of the  and  in figure 8 shows that while their post - maximum decline is very similar , the light curves before maximum have significant differences .",
    "figure 8 shows a large deficiency of   relative to  between 150 and 400 days and that  peaks about three weeks after .",
    "the 1240 emission from the far side of the ring may be delayed by 12 weeks by resonance scattering in the ring and the bipolar nebula , as discussed by lf96 .",
    "however , to obtain an even longer delay , and thus later @xmath76 , like the one observed , additional resonance scattering is needed .",
    "the most likely source is in the region interior to ring discussed by chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) .",
    "preliminary calculations by us show that there may be a sufficient optical depth in 1240 through this region along the line of sight to the far side of the ring .",
    "the large deficiency of  relative to  is therefore probably due to resonant scattering of  photons by n@xmath77 ions in and outside the ring .",
    "this biases the  flux maximum and complicates its interpretation by introducing effects other than light travel time and local recombination . in view of the uncertainties in interpreting the  light curve ,",
    "we believe @xmath78 provides the best measure of the time of maximum , @xmath79 , and we use this in our subsequent analysis .",
    "figure 9 shows the , , and  fluxes up to day 120 .",
    "all three lines appear very abruptly , as predicted .",
    "there is also an ionization dependence in the turn - on times",

    ".  appeared last , between 85.2 and 90.9 days .",
    "while it is possible that  was present at a very weak level between day 70 and 85 , the measurements are consistent with zero flux based on the scatter before day 60 .",
    "since the semi - forbidden lines are not effected by scattering , , the next highest ionization state after , should closely track the inside edge of the ring .",
    "however , as discussed below ( see also fig . 6 in lf96 ) , the  light curve is significantly affected by resonance scattering which introduce large systematic errors .",
    "consequently we believe  is also inappropriate for measuring @xmath80 .",
    "we take the sharp rise in the  flux as the turn - on time and find @xmath81 days ( estimated error ) . the uncertainty in the turn - on time",
    "is set by the spacing of the observations , and consequently @xmath80 may not be resolved in the data .    on the near side of the ring resonance scattering of  by n@xmath77 ions in the ring and any other intervening highly ionized circumstellar gas",

    "the most likely explanation to this apparent inconsistency is the ionization stratification of the ionized gas .",
    "the effect of stratification on the turn on of  should be larger if there is an region interior to the ring from which there also may be weak  emission .",
    "another possible source of early   emission is the bipolar nebula close to the ring , but away from its equatorial plane where the nebula may not be ionization bounded .",
    "this part of the nebula may have a lower density than the ring causing it to glow early in , but not in other uv lines due to long recombination time scales .      the first swp high dispersion spectrum of  during the narrow emission line phase was taken on 1987 nov . 25 ( day 275 ) and used in paper i. nineteen additional high dispersion swp spectra were obtained between then and day 1652 .",

    "although this may be a reasonable approximation for the overall geometry of the ring , there may be local variations of the radius around the ring .",
    "in particular , a small inward kink or near - absence of gas on the far side of the ring would give a smaller @xmath79 than for a circular ring , thus underestimating @xmath126 .",
    "second , the structure of the [   ring at @xmath123 days was probably different from the structure of the gas emitting the uv lines at @xmath127 days . indeed",
    ", lf96 found that the ionization structure of the ring changes dramatically in only a few hundred days .",
    "the uv lines are somewhat more sensitive to temperature and somewhat more peaked towards the inner edge of the ring than forbidden line emission ( e.g. , [ ) . the analyses of panagia et al . and gould may be effected by a systematic error arising from the assumption that the optical forbidden lines and uv lines come from the same gas ( but not observed at the same epoch ) .",
    "depending on the radial distribution of the density in the ring , the [   structure could either have a smaller , or larger , mean radius than the early uv line emission .",
    "we also point out that their analyses used uv line fluxes from two independent reductions ( labeled _ gsfc _ and _ vilspa _ shown by panagia et al .",
    "( 1991 ) of the _ same _ set of spectra , thus the number of independent data points is too large by a factor of two .",
    "the increased number of observations compared to paper i , reduced measurement and systematic errors , and improved signal - to - noise ratios make it important to repeat the abundance analysis . in order to convert the ionic ratios obtained from the line ratios to elemental abundances , assumptions about these relations have to be made .",
    "more specifically , in paper i it was assumed that n / c = /   and n / o = (  + ) /.",
    "the calculations by lf91 and lf96 show that , because of a balance of recombinations and collisional ionizations , this is a good approximation until the decay of the lines begin .",
    "after this epoch the gas temperature is too low for collisional ionization to be important for , , and , and the lines decay on their respective recombination time scales .",
    "these are quite different for the ions involved , and consequently the relations above break down . before @xmath128 days",

    "the nebular analysis has a number of limitations .",
    "a nebular model gives a reliable estimate of the ionization structure under steady - state conditions or immediately after the gas has been ionized .",

    "for example , at @xmath79 the part on the very far side of the ring can be roughly explained by a nebular structure , but the gas on the very near side has had @xmath155 days to evolve away from such a structure .",
    "because the observed emission at @xmath79 is an overlay of emission from different parts of the ring which have had different times to evolve off the steady - state structure , a pure nebular analysis is bound to have some systematic error .",

    "these conclusions agree with those of plait et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and lf96 .",
    "the line emission becomes dominated by gas of decreasing density because cooling and recombination time scales are inversely proportional to electron density .",
    "therefore , the flux seen at early times is likely to come from gas of considerably higher density than at later times ( lf96 ) , consistent with the order of magnitude decrease in @xmath98 derived in  4.4 from high - dispersion spectra .",

    "additional information about the density distribution can be inferred from the low resolution observations .",
    "lf96 find it necessary to include gas with electron densities down to @xmath192 to explain the slow decline of the lines after maximum .",
    "such a distribution of densities in the emitting gas is expected from hydrodynamic simulations of the circumstellar structure of   ( blondin & lundqvist 1993 ) , which show that the highest densities are found close to the ring plane .",
    "they also find that there is a large amount of low density gas both in and out of the plane , possibly accounting for the gas causing the resonance scattering of 1240 .",
    "if the low density gas is ionized up to  and higher , and has a density of @xmath193 , this may also give rise to a weak , steady line emission , as predicted by lf91 .",
    "they argued that such emission should be the sign of the inner parts of the unshocked red supergiant wind . in the interacting winds scenario",
    "( e.g. , blondin & lundqvist 1993 ; martin & arnett 1995 ) , the emission could also come from the _ shocked _ red supergiant wind ( lf96 ) or perhaps the region interior to the ring ( chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ) .",
    "the increasing importance of density components with @xmath194 after @xmath195 days is consistent with the observed decrease in electron density inferred from density - sensitive line ratios ( ,  4.4 ) and the optical [  and [  lines ( wampler et al . 1989 ; wang 1991 ; lf96 ) .",
    "there are also some theoretical indications for gas with @xmath196 .",
    "lf96 model three components with different densities and find that the bulk of the  emission at @xmath127 days originates in their highest density component ( @xmath197 ) , i.e. , close to what we derive in  4.4 .",
    "it is likely that there is a continuous range of densities rather than components with a  few discrete densities .",
    "the component with @xmath198 in lf96 therefore represents a mean value at the high end of this range , indicating the existence of gas with even higher densities .",
    "the scatter in the  light curve is considerably larger during the first 400 days than at later times ( fig .",
    "6c ) , which may be a further sign of components with @xmath199 . because recombination from  to  is rapid , and collisional ionization unimportant , the emissivity of the  line declines rapidly with time at a given point in the emitting gas ( see fig . 2 of lf91 ) . therefore ,",
    "the flux of the  line is not severely smoothed by the light echo , and responds rapidly to changes in the density of material being swept up by the light echo paraboloid . when higher density gas is encountered , the result is a momentary increase in the observed flux , and may thus explain the fluctuations .",
    "fluctuations due to density variations around the ring decrease in importance when the full ring is seen and only recombination is important . the narrow spikes in  and   between days 350 and 500 ( see fig",
    ". 6 ) are also probably due to higher density gas and the ` arcsine ' shape of the light curve , characteristic of a ring geometry ( e.g. , felten & dwek 1991 ; lundqvist 1991 ) .",
    "there is also evidence for density structure in the gas after maximum , especially in  and  near day 900 to 1000 .",
    "these fluctuations indicate that there may be regions of high density @xmath200 times further away from the supernova than the ring radius .",
    "( this flux increase might also arise from the outer rings , as discussed in  4.1 . )",
    "several groups have detected blobs in the optical and near - infrared which may be responsible for these fluctuations .",
    "allen et al . ( 1989 ) detected a concentration of 1.083 @xmath201 m emission , and they estimate a gas density of @xmath202 .",
    "extended 1.083 @xmath201 m emission was also observed by elias et al .",
    "crotts , kunkel , & mccarthy ( 1989 ) and hanuschik ( 1991 ) detected @xmath203 blobs on days 750 and 950 , respectively , and cumming & meikle ( 1993 ) found evidence for a high density blob with short life time on day 1344 .",
    "cumming & meikle estimate that the gas density in the blob has to be @xmath204 and argue that it may be accounted for by the high density regions forming off the equatorial plane in the hydrodynamic models by blondin & lundqvist ( 1993 ) .",
    "comparison of the observations with a realistic , self - consistent photoionization / recombination model of the circumstellar ring is necessary to test the interpretation of these data .",
    "such a model includes solving the coupled , time dependent equations for temperature and ionization ; separating these two aspects leads to an unphysical model .",
    "knowledge of the emissivity as a function of time and position makes it straightforward to incorporate the light echo effect .",
    "this was first done by lundqvist & fransson ( 1987 ) , and later by fransson & lundqvist ( 1989 ) and lf91 . in those models",
    "it was assumed that the emission originated in a _",
    "spherical _ shell of density @xmath205 .",
    "for the ionizing burst at breakout two  explosion models were used , the 10l model by woosley ( 1988 ) and the 11e1y6 model by shigeyama et al .",
    "qualitatively , both outburst models reproduced the observed relative line strengths surprisingly well , considering the lack of free parameters .",
    "the calculations agree fairly well with the rapid increase of the  and  lines , and the nearly constant flux in the  line during the first @xmath9 days .",
    "the steady  flux was found to be a result of collisional excitation .",
    "the model of lf91 based on shigeyama et al.s 11e1y6 spectrum provided the best agreement with both the behavior of the uv lines and the gas temperature , as determined from the [ @xmath206 ratio . the harder burst spectrum by shigeyama et al .",
    "was therefore favored .",
    "a closer examination , however , reveals several deficiencies .",
    "calculations using both the 10l and 11e1y6 models produced too rapid an increase in emission flux , especially the  line , which rises almost linearly with time ( fig .",
    "as discussed by lundqvist ( 1994 ) and lf96 , this may be the result of resonance scattering of the  line , not included in the early models .",
    "lf96 also find that the slow decline of the  line may be a result of resonance scattering in gas external to the ring .",
    "the scattering gas could extend as much as @xmath207 cm away from the ring plane .",
    "the fact that the maxima of the , ,  and  lines are all observed to occur at nearly the same time poses a more serious problem for the lf91 models , which in contrast show the  and  lines peaking considerably later than . in addition , the optical [  lines show a persistent emission up to @xmath208 days , in contrast to the early models .",
    "there are two important factors not taken into account in the first models which probably account for these discrepancies .",
    "as acknowledged by lf91 , the assumption of only one density component is artificial , and the observations clearly indicate that this is not true .",
    "a combination of density components , or more realistically a continuum of densities , ranging from @xmath209 to at least @xmath198 , gives considerably better agreement , as demonstrated by lf96 .",
    "however , such a distribution can not be specified in a unique way as it depends on the detailed structure of the ring .",
    "the other important assumption in lf91 was that of a spherical geometry .",
    "a toroidal geometry changes the light curve , when integrating over the light echo paraboloid , as discussed by lundqvist ( 1991 ) , luo ( 1991 ) and dwek & felten ( 1992 ) .",
    "a generic feature of a ring model compared to a spherical shell is the rapid rise in the observed fluxes close to maximum light .",
    "this basically reflects the amount of emitting gas swept up by the light echo paraboloid per unit time .",
    "even more important , the larger radial thickness required by a toroidal geometry also implies that the ionized gas will be optically thick in the euv continuum .",
    "as already explained , the ionization will then be stratified radially , with several distinct ionization zones ( lundqvist 1992 ; lf96 ) .",
    "the consequence for the light curve is to give nearly simultaneous maxima for the different ions , as is observed .",
    "in addition , ensman & burrows ( 1992 ) find that the ionizing spectra used in lf91 are probably too soft , as was also pointed out in lf91 .",
    "ensman & burrows find that the sn spectrum at breakout will have a high energy tail due to electron scattering .",
    "ensman & burrows also note that light travel time effects smooth the time variation of the spectrum , as may also be the case if the progenitor was non - spherical ( see lundqvist 1992 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "however , lf96 find that this effect is unimportant for the ionization of the ring .    in summary ,",
    "the light curves are fully consistent with a circular ring geometry , both from the rapid rise close to maximum light seen in the  and  lines , the turn - on time of these lines , and the near - coincidence of the light curve peaks .",
    "a ring geometry also makes it easier to understand the low expansion velocity , @xmath210 ( luo & mccray 1991 ; blondin & lundqvist 1993 ) . the origin of the ring , however , remains obscure ( e.g. , podsiadlowski 1992 for a review ) .",
    "the high n / c and n / o ratios put strong constraints on the ring implying that it must have been formed after the dredge up phase .",
    "an interesting proposal by mccray & lin ( 1994 ) explains the ring as the result of the gradual evaporation of a circumstellar disk around the progenitor .",
    "they explain the nitrogen enrichment as a result of gradual spraying of the inner boundary of the disk by the red supergiant wind . any model for the formation of the ring must also be able to explain the outer rings observed by wampler et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , wang & wampler ( 1992 ) , burrows et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and plait et al .",
    "the interacting winds model ( e.g. , luo & mccray 1991 ; blondin & lundqvist 1993 ) may do so , as demonstrated qualitatively by martin & arnett ( 1995 ) , and so may the model by lloyd , obrien , & kahn ( 1995 ) .",
    "the interacting winds model can also account for the continuum observations of crotts et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( martin & arnett 1995 ) , and the hot gas responsible for the resonance scattering of the  line ( lf96 ) .",
    "however , the high density of the outer rings , a few @xmath211 ( estimated by lf96 ) suggests that the interacting winds model needs some adjustment .",
    "an interesting extension is that of chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) .",
    "they assume a lower mass loss rate during the blue supergiant stage , implying that photoionization by the progenitor is important during the shaping of the nebula .",
    "a test of the models for the formation of the observed structure around  will be possible as the supernova ejecta strikes the ring shortly after the year @xmath212 ( e.g. , masai & nomoto 1994 ; luo , mccray , & slavin 1994 ; chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ; borkowski , blondin & mccray 1996 ) .",
