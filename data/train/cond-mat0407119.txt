    "the development of experimental techniques to create a single vortex in a dilute trapped bose - einstein condensate ( bec )  @xcite rapidly led to larger arrays containing up to several hundred vortices  @xcite . typically , these condensates rotate rapidly , with angular velocities @xmath0 that approach the radial trap oscillator frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting centrifugal effect significantly weakens the radial confinement , so that the condensate expands radially and shrinks axially  @xcite .    in a pure harmonic radial trap ,",
    "the limit @xmath4 is singular , because the thomas - fermi ( tf ) radius diverges and the central density decreases toward zero .",

    ", the width @xmath42 is fixed by the geometry of the container , and vortices first appear with increasing @xmath0 when @xmath226 is of order @xmath42 . to be more precise , the irrotational flow in an annulus has the characteristic feature that the velocity @xmath227 _ decreases _ with increasing @xmath228 , whereas the preferred solid - body flow @xmath229 _",

    "a detailed analysis of the free energy of the various relevant states  @xcite predicted that a one - dimensional vortex array appears with _ increasing _ @xmath0 at a ( dimensional ) critical angular velocity @xmath231 , where @xmath42 is the width of the annular gap and @xmath109 is the vortex core radius .",

    "experiments on superfluid @xmath225he using second - sound attenuation verified this predicted critical angular velocity in considerable detail  @xcite ( including the location at the midpoint of the gap ) .    in the present case of a rotating annular condensate ,",
    "the width @xmath42 decreases like @xmath155 , which is faster than the decrease of the intervortex spacing .",
    "hence the transition here is expected to occur in the reverse order , with the irrotational giant vortex appearing for large @xmath0 .",
    "the relevant comparison state is a one - dimensional vortex array in addition to the irrotational flow , as seen in fig .  [",

    ", it is convenient to study only the case of a single vortex located at the midpoint of the gap combined with macroscopic circulation . the analysis is lengthy and will not be given here because the resulting critical angular velocity does not agree well with the numerical work .",
    "thus it suffices merely to state that the transition from one vortex with irrotational flow to the pure irrotational flow is predicted to occur at a critical angular velocity @xmath232 as the angular velocity increases .",
    "figure [ fig : phased ] also compares the critical angular velocity @xmath50 for the transition from the vortex lattice to the giant - vortex state .",

    "the lowest energy solution of the gp equation does not correspond to a giant vortex , which suggests that for these values of @xmath0 the giant vortex is stable against the formation of a single vortex , but is unstable against the formation of an array of vortices ( see fig.[fig : vortfm ] ) .",
    "this work has considered a two - dimensional rapidly rotating bose - einstein condensate in a radial trap with both quadratic and quartic confining components , which allows the external rotation @xmath0 to exceed the harmonic trap frequency @xmath1 .",
    "both an analytical thomas - fermi description and a full numerical study of the gross - pitaevskii equation show the formation of a central hole at essentially the same critical angular velocity @xmath3 ( the analytical value apparently remains quite accurate even for small values of the coupling constant @xmath29 where the thomas - fermi approximation is less valid ) . for larger angular velocities ,",
    "the numerical work for @xmath125 indicates a transition to a pure irrotational state ( a giant vortex ) , but our approximate analytical model predicts too small a value for this transition .",
    "experimental work at the cole normale suprieure , paris  @xcite created a quartic confinement with a blue - detuned gaussian laser directed along the axial direction . for their trap ,",
    "the nonrotating condensate was cigar shaped , and the strength of the quartic admixture was @xmath233 .",
    "for dimensionless rotation speed @xmath234 , the condensate was nearly spherical , and it remained stable for @xmath235 .",
    "near the upper limit , the condensate exhibited a definite local minimum in the central density , confirming the general features of our tf analysis . throughout the stable range of @xmath0 ,",
    "the measured shape of the condensate was fit to the tf prediction , which served as a direct determination of @xmath0 .",
    "they also used surface - wave spectroscopy  @xcite to provide an independent measure of the angular velocity ( even though the visible number of vortices appeared to be too small for @xmath236 ) .",
    "these experiments are very puzzling when compared to the previous numerical studies  @xcite , to previous analytical studies  @xcite and to the present work .",
    "why do the experiments fail to reach higher angular velocities , when the simulations readily reach the regime when the condensate becomes annular ?",
    "one possible source of the discrepancy is that the experimental condensate is definitely three - dimensional , whereas the simulations are two - dimensional ( apart from  @xcite ) .",
    "it is notable that even the experimental papers  @xcite suggest repeating the experiments with a condensate that is tightly confined in the @xmath13 direction . in addition , the low temperature of the experiments eliminates most dissipative processes that can equilibrate the system .",
    "this feature may make it difficult for the condensate to acquire more angular momentum as @xmath237 increases .",
    "in contrast , the numerical simulations work in imaginary time for a given @xmath0 , which leads to a state that is at least a local minimum in the energy .",
    "another different question concerns the transition to the giant vortex .",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that this transition occurs well beyond our analytical estimate @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ omega0 ] ) .",
    "this estimate is obtained by comparing the energy of the irrotational giant vortex with a similar irrotational state containing one additional quantized vortex at the midpoint of the annulus .",
    "based on the numerical simulations [ especially fig .",
    "[ fig : vortfm](f ) ] , it seems probable that adding more quantized vortices in a one - dimensional ring and/or allowing the radius of the ring to vary would lower the energy of this state relative to the irrotational state , because the specific choice of one vortex at the midpoint seems somewhat arbitrary for a dilute trapped condensate . for superfluid @xmath225he in a rotating annulus",
    ", the image vortices raise the energy if a vortex approaches either wall , but such an effect is absent in the present case .",
    "if so , such an improved analysis would increase the estimated critical angular velocity for the transition to a giant vortex .",
    "it is also conceivable that the mean radius of the one - dimensional vortex array simply shrinks inside the inner tf radius @xmath238 .",
    "this latter situation would suggest a crossover instead of a sharp transition , because the actual condensate necessarily extends into the classically forbidden region .",
