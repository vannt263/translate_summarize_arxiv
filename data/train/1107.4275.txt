    "the inner - crust of neutron stars extends from the so - called neutron drip density , @xmath0 g @xmath1 , defined as the density where the neutrons start to drip out from the nuclei of the crust , up to a density of about @xmath2 g @xmath1 at which there is a transition towards the uniform core matter .",
    "the size and the precise density limits of the inner crust depend on the star mass and on the equation of state employed in the star models @xcite .",
    "the inner - crust matter of non - accreting cold neutron stars is most probably formed by a crystal lattice of nuclear clusters immersed in a sea of low - density superfluid neutrons and ultra - relativisitic electrons .",
    "it is generally considered that in most of its part the inner - crust is formed of nuclei - like clusters .",
    "more complex `` pasta '' structures ( e.g. , rods , plates , bubbles ) are expected to be formed in the transition region between the inner crust and the core matter , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the first microscopic calculation of the inner - crust structure , still used as a benchmark in neutron stars studies ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) was performed by negele and vautherin in 1973  @xcite . in this work",
    "the crystal lattice is divided in spherical cells which are treated in the wigner - seitz ( ws ) approximation .",
    "the nuclear matter from each cell is described in the framework of hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation based on the density matrix expansion ( dme )  @xcite .",
    "this approach was preferred to the density - dependent hartree - fock theory  @xcite in order to reduce computational complication induced by the non - local exchange potential .",
    "the parameters of the dme theory were adjusted to reproduce the experimental binding energies of atomic nuclei and the theoretical calculation of infinite neutron matter available at that time .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction was taken into account for the protons but neglected for the neutrons .",
    "the hf equations were solved in coordinate representation imposing mixed dirichlet - neuman boundary conditions at the border of the cells .",
    "the properties of the ws cells found in ref .",
    "@xcite , determined for a limited set of densities , are shown in table  [ tab : nv ] .",
    "the most remarkable result of this calculation is that the majority of the cells have semi - magic and magic proton numbers , i.e. , z=40,50 .",
    "this indicates that in these calculations there are strong proton shell effects , as in isolated atomic nuclei .",
    "however , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] of ref .",
    "@xcite the energies corresponding to the cells configurations based on various z numbers are in fact very close to each other .",
    "this fact raises several questions : i ) what is the sensitivity of the results on the nuclear interaction , ii ) how much the pairing correlations influence the cells structure , iii ) how reliable is the ws approximation .",
    "the effect of pairing correlations on the structure of ws cells was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite within the hf+bcs approach . in the most recent version of these calculations",
    "the authors solved the hf+bcs equations with a mixture between the phenomenological functional of fayans et al  @xcite , employed in the nuclear cluster region , and a microscopical functional derived from bruckner - hartree - fock calculations in infinite neutron matter .",
    "the latter was used to describe the neutron gas in the ws cells . in this framework",
    "it was found that the cells have not a magic or semi - magic number of protons , as in ref .",
    "it was also found that pairing can change significantly the structure of the cells compared to hf calculations .",
    "these findings show that in order to determine the most probable structure of the inner crust one needs more investigations based on various effective interactions and many - body approximations .",
    "in this study we analyse the effect of pairing on inner crust structure in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach ( hfb ) .",
    "this approach offers better grounds than hf+bcs approximation for treating pairing correlations in non - uniform nuclear matter with both bound and unbound neutrons . to investigate the dependence of the inner crust structure on pairing ,",
    "the hfb calculations are performed with three different density - dependent pairing forces adjusted to reproduce various pairing scenarios in nuclear matter .    in principle , the symmetries of the inner crust lattice should be taken properly into account when inner crust structure is determined . since imposing the exact lattice symmetries in microscopic self - consistent models is a very difficult task ( for approximative solutions to this problem see  @xcite and the references therein ) we solve the hfb equations in the ws approximation , as commonly done in inner crust studies @xcite .",
    "this approximation induces , through the boundary conditions at the border of the cells , an artificial shell structure in the energy spectra of nonlocalized neutrons @xcite .",
    "the errors caused by the spurious shells , which affect mainly the high density cells , are estimated by using the method proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe how the cells energy is calculated in the hfb and ws approximations , in section iii we present the equations for beta equilibrium and in section iv we discuss the results of the calculations .",
    "as in ref .",

    "the energy of the cell , relevant for determining the cell structure , has contributions from the nuclear and the coulomb interactions .",
    "its expression is written in the following form @xmath4 the first term is the mass difference @xmath5 where n and z are the number of neutrons and protons in the cell and a = n+z .",
    "@xmath6 is the binding energy of the nucleons , which includes the contribution of proton - proton coulomb interaction inside the nuclear cluster .",
    "@xmath7 is the kinetic energy of the electrons while @xmath8 is the lattice energy which takes into account the electron - electron and electron - proton interactions .",
    "the contribution to the total energy coming from the interaction between the ws cells @xcite it is not considered since it is very small compared to the other terms of eq.(1 ) .",
    "notice also that the gravitational energy is not taken into account in the energy minimization because its variation at the nuclear scale is negligible .      in the present study",
    "the nuclear binding energy of the ws cells is calculated in the framework of hfb approach . for the particle - hole channel",
    "we use a skyrme - type interaction of the standard form @xcite , i.e. , @xmath9\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\ ; t_2(1+x_2 p_\\sigma)\\frac{1}{\\hbar^2}\\pmb{p}_{ij}.\\delta(\\pmb{r}_{ij})\\ ,   \\pmb{p}_{ij } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ ; \\frac{1}{6}t_3(1+x_3 p_\\sigma)\\rho(\\pmb{r})^\\gamma\\,\\delta(\\pmb{r}_{ij } ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\ ; \\frac{\\rm i}{\\hbar^2}w_0(\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma_i+\\sigma_j$})\\cdot \\pmb{p}_{ij}\\times\\delta(\\pmb{r}_{ij})\\,\\pmb{p}_{ij }   \\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the relative momentum , and @xmath13 is the two - body spin - exchange operator .",

    "this effective pairing interaction is extensively used in nuclear structure calculations and it was also employed for describing pairing correlations in the inner crust of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the parameters are chosen to reproduce in infinite neutron matter two possible pairing scenarios @xcite , corresponding to a maximum gap of about 3 mev ( strong pairing scenario , hereafter named iss ) and , respectively , to a maximum gap around 1 mev ( weak pairing scenario , called below isw ) .",

    "the other parameters are taken the same for the strong and the weak pairing , i.e. , @xmath22=0.45 , @xmath23=0.7 and @xmath19=0.16 @xmath21 .",

    "the continuous quasiparticle spectrum of the unbound neutrons is discretized .",
    "compared to the usual hfb calculations done for nuclei , in a ws cell the mean field of the protons has an additional contribution coming from the interaction of the protons with the electrons .",
    "thus , the total proton mean field in the cell is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the nuclear part of the mean field , given by the skyrme interaction , while @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the mean fields corresponding to the coulomb proton - proton and proton - electron interactions .",

    "beta equilibrium condition is satisfied if @xmath62 where @xmath63    the chemical potential of the electrons can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the contributions coming from the electron - electron and electron - proton interaction .",
    "they are given by : @xmath67 @xmath68    the chemical potentials of the neutrons and protons are extracted from the hfb calculations . the contribution of the proton - electron interaction to the chemical potential of the protons is included through the proton - electon mean field ( 14 ) .    as seen in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , the proton mean field includes also the contribution of the proton - electron interaction    the beta equilibrium condition can be satisfied exactly when the chemical potential of the neutrons , determined by the nonlocalized neutrons , is a continuous variable . in the calculations done here",
    "the neutron spectrum is discretized due to the boundary conditions imposed at the border of the cells ( it is worth mentioning that this discretization has nothing to do with the discrete structure of the neutron spectrum generated by the symmetry of the crystal lattice ) .",
    "consequently the beta equilibrium condition is satisfied only approximatively .",
    "in practice , we consider that the beta equilibrium condition is found when by changing the n / z ratio the value of @xmath69 is changing the sign . then , from the two n / z configurations for which @xmath69 is changing the sign we keep the one which has the smaller binding energy .",
    "it is worth stressing that the beta equilibrium condition depends , through the discretization of the neutron spectrum , on the type of boundary conditions imposed at the border of the cells . how the type of boundary conditions could influence the structure of the cells",
    "is discussed in ref  @xcite .",
    "within the framework presented in the previous sections we have determined the properties of the ws cells , i.e. the n / z ratio and the radius of the cells .",
    "the calculations have been done for the set of baryonic densities shown in table  [ tab : nv ] . to find the structure of the cell at a given density we have considered all the configurations with the even number of protons between 12 and 60 . for each number of protons we modified the radius of the cell with a step of 0.2 fm , keeping the same total density , until the number of neutrons included in the cell satisfies with the best accuracy the beta equilibrium condition . the most probable configuration at a given density is finally taken as the one with the lowest binding energy .",
    "first we have determined the structure of the ws cells in the hf approximation , i.e. , neglecting the contribution of pairing correlations .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : hf ] .",
    "compared to previous calculations @xcite we find that the cells have a smaller number of protons .",
    "table ii shows also that the number of protons are not anymore equal to a magic or a semi - magic number as in ref.@xcite ( see table i ) .    to understand better the results of table ii , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ehf ] we show the evolution of the binding energies per nucleon , calculated at beta equilibrium and at constant density , with respect to the proton number @xmath70 .",
    "the most probable configuration corresponds to the number of protons for which the binding energy has the lowest value . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ehf ] it can be seen that in the cells 1 and 2 there is a continuous decrease of the binding energy for the lowest values of @xmath70 .",
    "thus , for these cells the hf calculations can not predict a well - defined cell structure . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ehf ] it can be also seen that even for the cells in which one can identify a configuration with the lowest binding energy , the difference between this energy and the energy of other local minima is very small , of the order of 10 kev .",
    "the weak dependence of the binding energy on @xmath70 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ehf ] is caused by the almost exact compensation between the nuclear energy and the electron kinetic energy .",
    "this can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ehf2 ] where are shown , for the cells 2 and 6 , the contributions to the total energy coming from the nuclear energy ( dashed line ) and the kinetic energy of the electrons ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "it can be noticed that the local minima of nuclear binding energy at @xmath71 and @xmath72 are washed out by the kinetic energy of the electrons .",
    "the competition between the nuclear and coulomb interaction , specific to the so - called frustrated systems , it is the reason why the structure of the ws cells it is not necessarily determined by the nuclear interaction and the associated nuclear shell effects .",
    "a necessary condition for the validity of the ws approximation is the appearance in the neutron density of a well - defined plateau before the edge of the cell . from fig .",
    "[ fig : den ] ( left pannel ) it can be observed that this condition is hardly fulfilled for the cell 1 , reasonably well for the cell 2 and better for the other cells .",
    "we shall now discuss the effect of pairing correlations on the structure of the ws cells . to study the influence of pairing correlations we have performed hfb calculations with the three pairing interactions introduced in section 3a .",
    "how the pairing correlations are distributed in the cells is illustrated in fig.4 ( right pannel ) which shows the pairing fields of neutrons and protons for the force iss . as expected , the pairing field profile has a non - uniform distribution which could be traced back to the density dependence of the pairing force @xcite .",
    "the proton pairing field stays localized inside the nuclear cluster since a drip out of protons is not observed in our calculations .",
    "it can be noticed that for the cells 5 and 10 , with the proton numbers @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( see table  [ tab : hfb ] ) , the proton fields are zero .",
    "this indicates that in the nuclear clusters corresponding to these cells the proton numbers @xmath73 behave as magic numbers , as in atomic nuclei .",
    "the dependence of pairing energy on z is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 ( right pannel ) for the cells number 2 and 6 .",
    "one observes that in average the absolute value of the pairing energy is decreasing with z , which shows that the dominant contribution to pairing comes from the nonlocalized neutrons ( notice that for a cell the hfb calculations with various z are done for a fixed total density ) .",
    "the structure of the ws cells obtained in the hfb approach is given in table  [ tab : hfb ] while in fig .",
    "[ fig : ehfb ] it is shown the dependence of the binding energies , at beta equilibrium , on protons number . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ehfb ] we observe that in the cell 1 the binding energy does not converge to a minimum before z=12 .",
    "for the cells 2 - 4 a minimum can be found for the isw and/or ivs forces but this minimum is very close to the value of binding energy at z=12 .",
    "therefore the structure of the cells 2 - 4 is ambiguous . the situation is different in the cells 5 - 10 where the binding energies converge to absolute minima located before z=12 .",
    "thus for these cells the structure can be well - defined by the present hfb calculations .    comparing table  [ tab : hfb ] and table  [ tab : hf ]",
    "it can be observed that for the cells 6 - 9 the numbers of protons in the hf and hfb calculations differ by about 2 units .",
    "the largest difference , of 10 units , appears for the cell 5 .",
    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ehfb ] , the hf minimum at z=30 is in fact very close to the local minimum at z=22 .",
    "a similar situation can be noticed in cell 10 for the hf minima at z=24 and z=28 . in conclusion , these calculations indicate that the pairing does not change much the structure of the low density cells 5 - 10 .",
    "this could be also observed from the fact that in these cells the intensity of pairing force has only marginal effects on the proton and neutron numbers .",
    "let us now discuss more in detail what happens in the high density region for the configurations with small z and small cells radii .",
    "when the radius of the cell becomes too small the boundary conditions imposed at the cell border through the ws approximation generate an artificial large distance between the energy levels of the nonlocalized neutrons .",
    "consequently , the binding energy of the neutron gas is significantly underestimated .",
    "an estimation of how large could be the errors in the binding energy induced by the ws approximation can be obtained from the quantity @xmath74 where the first term is the binding energy per neutron for infinite neutron matter of density @xmath75 and the second term is the binding energy of neutron matter with the same density calculated inside the cell of radius @xmath76 and employing the same boundary conditions as in hf or hfb calculations . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed for the finte size energy correction , eq .",
    "26 , the following parametrisation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the average density of neutrons in the gas region extracted from a calculation in which the cell contains both the nuclear cluster and the nonlocalized neutrons while @xmath19 is the nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "how the energy corrections described by eq.(25 ) influences the hf ( hfb ) results can be seen in tables  iii ( tables - iv ) and fig .  2 ( fig .  5 ) . as expected , the influence of the corrections is more important for the cells 1 - 5 , in which the neutron gas has a higher density , and for those configurations corresponding to small cell radii .",
    "for the cell 1 the binding energy after the correction is still decreasing for the smallest z values , which means that the structure of this cell remains uncertain .",
    "the structure of the cells 2 - 4 can be now determined for all pairing forces . however , as seen in fig .",
    "5 , for these cells the absolute minima are still very close to the binding energies at z=12 which shows that the structure of these cells remains ambiguous even after the energy correction .",
    "in this paper we have examined the influence of pairing correlations on the structure of inner crust of neutron stars .",
    "the study was done for the region of the inner crust which is supposed to be formed by a lattice of spherical clusters .",
    "the lattice was treated as a set of independent cells described in the wigner - seitz approximation . to determine the structure of a cell we have used the nuclear binding energy given by the hfb approach . for the hfb calculations we have considered a particle - hole interaction of skyrme type ( sly4 ) while as particle - particle interaction we have used three zero range density - dependent pairing forces of various intensities .",
    "the calculations show that the pairing correlations have a weak influence on the structure of ws cells .",
    "for the cells with high density and small radii the binding energies do not converge to a minimum when the proton number has small values .",
    "we believe that the reason for that is the failure of the ws approximation when the cell radius is too small . for a small radius of the cell",
    "the average distance between the energy levels of the nonlocalised neutrons becomes artificially large which cause an underestimation of the binding energy . to correct this drawback",
    "we have used an empirical expression based on the comparison between the binding energy of neutrons calculated in infinite matter geometry and in a spherical cell @xcite .",
    "we found that the corrections to the binding energies are significant for the high density cells with small proton numbers .",
    "this show that the ws approximation is not accurately enough for predicting the structure of the high density region of the inner crust .",
