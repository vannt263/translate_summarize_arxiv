    "the molecular gas content of the clouds is very important if we are to estimate the star formation efficiency and relate it to the properties of the clouds and to their environments .",
    "the total  mass , however , can not be measured directly because the lowest levels of  from which the observable emission can arise have excitation energies ( e.g. , @xmath2 @xmath3 500 k , @xmath4 = @xmath5 ) too high to be thermally excited in the cold ( @xmath6  k ) molecular clouds . in the milky way , the @xmath1co  line . ]",

    "the conversion factor ( @xmath7 ) between the  column density and the velocity integrated intensity of co has been measured via the virial theorem ( @xmath7 = @xmath8 / ( ) , solomon et al .",
    "1987 ; digel et al .",

    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the metallicity dependence of the conversion factor has been an issue .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and wilson ( 1995 ) used cloud masses determined using the virial theorem to argue that the value of @xmath10 increases as the metallicity of the individual galaxy decreases .",
    "arimoto , sofue , & tsujimoto ( 1996 ) extend this conclusion to argue that there are radial increases in @xmath10 in the milky way and m51 corresponding to radial decreases in metallicity . by contrast , taylor , kobulnicky , & skillman ( 1996 ) showed that some low abundance galaxies have lower @xmath10 , suggesting that a factor other than the abundance ( e.g. , temperature ) can affect the measured value of @xmath10 .",
    "far - uv photons from massive young stars strike the surfaces of nearby molecular clouds and produce photodissociation regions or photon - dominated regions ( hereafter pdrs , tielens & hollenbach 1985 , 1997 ) . in these surface layers ,",
    "the far - uv photons dominate the ionization of atoms , the formation and destruction of molecules , and the heating of the gas . inside the pdr ,",
    "absorption by dust , c , and  diminishes the far - uv field .",
    "several authors have constructed pdr models appropriate to conditions in the magellanic clouds , with particular emphasis on the c@xmath0/c / co transition ( maloney & black 1988 ; van dishoeck & black 1988b ; lequeux et al .",
    "1994 ; maloney & wolfire 1997 ) . in irregular galaxies , where metallicities and dust - to - gas ratios are lower than those in the galaxy , far - uv photons penetrate deeper into clouds , and dissociate co molecules to greater depths ( israel et al .",
    "therefore , for a cloud with a given column density , the co column density should be lower at lower metallicity .",
    "if the  column density is high enough for the  to self - shield against photodissociation ( @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13  , van dishoeck & black 1988a ) , the co column density will also be high enough for the  line to be optically thick , and the  line intensity ( @xmath14 ) will not depend strongly on the metallicity . in that case , lower  intensities can only stem from geometrical or beam - filling effects . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cloud column density is not high , most of the co will be dissociated and the resulting  line will be optically thin and very weak . on the surface of the clouds , the destruction and formation of  molecules are also affected by the change of metallicity , but the mechanism is different from that for co molecules . the  molecules are dissociated by far - uv photons attenuated by dust or by  self - shielding . if  self - shielding dominates over dust attenuation , the  destruction rate is independent of the dust abundance . on the other hand , the  formation rate is proportional to the dust abundance , because  reforms on the surfaces of dust grains .",
    "the magellanic clouds are the best targets to test pdr models that include metallicity effects because of their proximity ( @xmath15 = 50.1  kpc and @xmath16 = 60.3  kpc , westerlund 1990 ) , their low metal abundance ( @xmath17 = 0.28 , @xmath18 = 0.54 , @xmath19 = 0.050 , and @xmath20 = 0.21 , where @xmath21 is normalized to the galactic value ; dufour 1984 ) , and their low dust - to - gas ratio ( @xmath22 = 0.25 and @xmath23 = 0.059 , where @xmath24 is normalized to the galactic value ; koornneef 1984 ) .",
    "in this paper , we observed the magellanic clouds in the near - ir  emission lines and in the  line ( see sections [ sec : obs5 ] and [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we compare the line intensities of  ,  , and [ ] 158  emission from the pdrs in the magellanic clouds with those from galactic star formation regions ( see section  [ sec : compare ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : models ] discusses the numerical pdr models which we compare to the observed data to learn how metallicity changes affect the chemical structure of the galactic clouds and the clouds in the magellanic clouds .",
    "some limited regions in the magellanic clouds were previously observed in the  lines ( koornneef & israel 1985 ; israel & koornneef 1988 ; kawara , nishida , & taniguchi 1988 ; israel & koornneef 1992 ; krabbe et al .",

    "1994 ; poglitsch et al . 1995",

    "we observed near - ir  emission lines from the magellanic clouds with the university of texas near - ir fabry - perot spectrometer whose equivalent - disk size , is the diameter of a cylindrical beam whose solid angle is same as the integrated solid angle of the actual beam pattern . ]",
    "( @xmath25 = 81 ) is comparable to those of the existing [ ] data ( @xmath25 = 68 ) and  data ( @xmath25 = 54 ) .",
    "we also observed  emission at positions where no emission had been detected at the sensitivity of the existing  surveys .",
    "we observed the  and  lines in 1994 december , and  and  lines in 1995 october , at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory 1.5 m telescope using the university of texas near - infrared fabry - perot spectrometer ( ut  fps , luhman et al .",
    "the instrument was designed to observe extended , low surface brightness line emission , and has a single 1  mm diameter insb detector to maximize the area - solid angle product .",
    "this product , @xmath26 , depends on the telescope coupling optics but can be made as large as @xmath27 @xmath28  sr .",
    "the beam from the @xmath29 secondary of the telescope is collimated and guided to an h - band or k - band fabry - perot interferometer and to a @xmath30  k ( solid nitrogen temperature ) dewar in which a doublet camera lens ( focal length = 20  mm ) focuses onto the detector .",
    "a 0.5  % ( for the  line ) or a 1  % ( for the  and  lines ) interference filter in the dewar selects a single order from the fabry - perot interferometer . we used a collimator of focal length = 838  mm in 1994 december run and a collimator of focal length = 686  mm in 1995 october .",
    "the change of the collimator affected the beam size and spectral resolution ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "since the coupling of the 686 mm collimator with the telescope optics is better , the beam profile in 1995 october is much closer to a box - function than the 1994 december beam profile ( figure  [ fig-01 ] ) .    an automatic alignment routine aligned the fabry - perot etalon by executing every @xmath31 minutes ( luhman et al .",
    "the fabry - perot etalon maintained alignment for @xmath32 minutes , but the ambient temperature changes caused the plate separation to drift by the equivalent of @xmath33  per minute . using telluric oh lines ( oliva and origlia 1992 ) , we calibrated the wavelength scale to within @xmath34 .",
    "we operated the fabry - perot interferometer in _ scanning mode _ at selected positions and in _ frequency switching mode _ at most positions . in the scanning mode , the plate separation of the etalon was varied to cover @xmath35  centered at the  line in 15 sequential steps .",
    "figure  [ fig-02 ] shows observed  and  lines at the 30 doradus ( 0 , 0 ) position ( see the object list in table  [ tbl-3 ] ) , and telluric oh lines .",
    "the oh ( 9,7 )  r@xmath36(2 ) ( @xmath37 = 2.12267  , wavelength in air , oliva & origlia 1992 ) and the ( 9,7 )  r@xmath38(1 ) ( @xmath37 = 2.12440  ) lines are within the  scan range .",
    "figure  [ fig-02 ] shows the red - wing of the oh ( 4,2 )  p@xmath38(3 ) ( @xmath37 = 1.61242  ) line , and the oh ( 4,2 )  p@xmath38(2 ) ( @xmath37 = 1.60264  ) line which was displaced by one free spectral range and penetrated through the blue side of the order sorting filter at @xmath39 @xmath3 420  .",
    "the typical intensity of the oh ( 4,2 )  p@xmath38(3 ) and ( 4,2 )  p@xmath38(2 ) lines is @xmath40  which is more than @xmath41 times the  intensity .",
    "the oh intensity fluctuates spatially and temporally .",
    "the @xmath42 power spectrum of the temporal fluctuations limits the sensitivity of the system , e.g. , in k - band , the oh noise becomes important at 30 seconds ( coadded integration time ) per step when the switching interval between the source position and an off - source `` sky '' position is two minutes ( luhman et al .",
    "1995 ) . in the observations of the magellanic clouds",
    ", we chopped the secondary mirror from the source to @xmath43 = @xmath44 or @xmath45 at 0.25  hz in h - band and 0.5  hz in k - band .",
    "each spectral step ( at the same etalon plate separation ) has one chopping cycle which consists of four exposures : @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath47 @xmath46 .",
    "each exposure had an integration time of 0.5 or 1 second .    in the frequency switching mode",
    ", we tuned the fabry - perot interferometer to the line wavelength , @xmath49 , and a nearby wavelength free of line emission , @xmath50 .",

    "we tried to place @xmath50 away from wings of the  instrument spectral profile for @xmath49 and at positions away from telluric oh lines ( see table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .    for flux calibration",

    "even though the beam sizes of the 1994 december run and the 1995 october run are different from each other ,  intensities measured at the same positions on both runs agree to within the errors .",
    "the absolute flux calibration is accurate to @xmath56  % .",
    "we observed  line in 1995 december at the sest located on la silla in chile .",
    "the beam size ( fwhm ) of the sest is 45 .",
    "the  intensities presented in this paper are the main beam brightness temperatures , @xmath58 ( see the convention by mangum 1993 ) .",
    "the online temperature , @xmath59 , has been converted to @xmath58 by dividing by 0.7 ( which is the product of the forward spillover and scattering efficiency , and the main beam efficiency ) .",
    "we used frequency switching to gain a factor of 2 in observing time and to avoid possible emission from reference positions .",
    "since this method can leave residual ripples in the spectra , the detection limit for weak signals is determined by the ripple .",
    "for some positions , we complemented the frequency switched data with beam switched data with a reference beam about 12  away in azimuth .",
    "for example , in the 30 doradus ( 0 , @xmath60 ) region , it turned out to be impossible to use the frequency switched data .",
    "we mapped  spectra around positions where we detected  emission and where the co emission was below the lowest contour level ( 3 ) of previously published co maps ( booth 1993 ; johansson et al .",
    "the co maps are fully sampled on 20  grids within each 81  beam . in a single 45  beam ,",
    "the typical root - mean - square noise is 0.07 k for a channel spacing of 0.45 , and the typical @xmath61 statistical uncertainty of the intensity @xmath62 = @xmath14 , integrated over a velocity range of 15 , is 0.2  .",
    "in low metallicity objects , the low dust abundance allows far - uv photons to penetrate for long distances beyond the /h boundary .",
    "one possible scenario is that the transparency to uv photons leads to substantial regions of neutral gas where far - uv photons have dissociated co but where self shielding permits hydrogen to be primarily in the form of . especially in the n159/n160 complex ,",
    "the published maps show the [ ] 158  emission ( israel et al . 1996 ) extending farther than the  emission ( johansson et al .",
    "these existing observations make such a possibility seem reasonable in the lmc .",
    "near - ir  emission in response to far - uv radiation provides a direct test for the presence of molecular gas near cloud boundaries , albeit with no information about column density or total abundance .",

    "models indicate that , like ,  is not affected strongly by changing from planar to spherical geometry .",
    "therefore , the similar offset of the data from models in figure [ fig-10 ] is probably due to the inappropriateness of applying the plane - parallel models for predicting .",
    "as were the data in figure [ fig-09 ] , only the data from the cloud proper zone in ngc 2024 are within the model space , and most of the observed data deviate systematically leftward from the model results .",
    "the data from the smc , which are not available in figure [ fig-09 ] , also deviate toward lower @xmath297 or higher @xmath298 from the lmc model results , if we assume that the smc models without spherical geometry effects are not very different from the lmc models . in the smc , the observed  emission could be higher than the model results as a result of the unreddened  emission from the back side of the cloud . because [ ] data are not available and the  data are not certain , we can not measure @xmath299 from the  versus  plane .",
    "we can still estimate a lower limit on the column density of clouds in the smc , assuming @xmath275 @xmath300 . applying the dust temperature of @xmath301",
    "k from iras 60/100  ratios ( see figure [ fig-07 ] ) to equations [ eq : g0-i_fir ] and [ eq : tfir_model ] , @xmath302 we obtain a far - uv field ( ) of @xmath303 at the observed positions in the smc .",
    "assuming @xmath274 = 3.7 , we get @xmath304 = @xmath305",
    ". therefore , the central column density ( @xmath248 ) of the clouds in the smc should be at least @xmath306 ( see table [ tbl-10 ] ) .",

    "we first derive @xmath151 and  by comparing the observed data and the model results in the /  versus /  plot ( figure [ fig-08 ] ) .",
    "we take a median value of the data in each object , except in n159 where we consider each position separately . using the values of @xmath151 and  derived from figure [ fig-08 ] ,",
    "we get , the depth from the surface of the cloud to the -to - c - to - co transition layer , in figure [ fig-11 ] .",
    "we also get @xmath275 , the parameter that accounts for spherical geometry , by comparing the data and models in figure [ fig-09 ] .",
    "when we do not have  or  data , we assume that @xmath274 = 3.7 , and estimated  from dust color temperature using @xmath287 and equations [ eq : t_dust ] and [ eq : i_uv - t_dust ] .",
    "we finally derive the central column densities of clouds using equation [ eq : epsilon ] , and list them in table [ tbl-10 ] ( see also figure [ fig-15 ] ) .",
    "note that the column densities derived in this way are a measure of the number of molecules between the /h boundary and the cloud center , not of the overall column denisyt through the gmc complexes .",
    "the cloud column density measured in the western edge zone in ngc 2024 is at least a factor of 5 smaller than the column density measured in the cloud proper zone in ngc 2024 . at the four data positions in n159 , the variations of @xmath151 and  are not significant , e.g. , 3.7 @xmath269 4.1 , and 2.3 @xmath270 2.7 ; however , the  intensities change by a factor of @xmath307 , indicating that the column density varies more than a factor of 5 within the n159 region .",
    "the cloud sizes represented by the hydrogen column density for a given density , @xmath151 = @xmath177 , in the lmc ( @xmath308 = @xmath309 ) , the smc ( @xmath310 ) , and ic 10 ( @xmath311 ) are bigger than those in the galaxy ( @xmath312 = @xmath313 ) .",
    "table [ tbl-10 ] and figures [ fig-14 ] and [ fig-15 ] show that the column density and , for constant density , cloud size depend roughly linearly on metallicity and therefore the visual extinction through clouds is constant as one goes from the galaxy to the lmc and smc .",
    "mckee ( 1989 ) presented a theory of _ photoionization - regulated star formation _",
    "( see also bertoldi & mckee 1996 ) . according to his theory ,",
    "the rate of low - mass star formation is governed by ambipolar diffusion in magnetically supported clouds , and the ionization of gas is mostly by far - uv photons .",
    "he suggested that the mean extinction of molecular clouds in dynamical equilibrium is in the range of  = @xmath314 mag .",
    "using equation [ eq : rho_dust ] , the range of extinction corresponds to : @xmath315 this range of column density roughly agrees with the empirical values of galactic gmcs using  and virial theorem : @xmath248 = @xmath316  ( scoville et al . 1987 ; solomon et al . 1987 ) . in regions with higher incident uv fields , the equilibrium range should move to higher column density .",
    "our results from the galaxy , the lmc , the smc , and ic 10 are also within  = @xmath317 mag , and agree with the theory to within a factor of two for the range of observed incident fields .",
    "we observed  , , and  lines from the magellanic clouds , and detected emission even in regions where co had not been seen during the eso - sest key program , implying that  is present in these regions . with deeper co observations",
    ", we also detected weak ( @xmath318 )  emission in pdrs where the previous eso - sest program did not detect  .",
    "we conclude that , in all regions where we could detect , co is not completely dissociated and that the  emission is still optically thick in the magellanic clouds .",
    "our observations may have consequences for studies using co to trace molecular mass .",
    "our spherical - shell cloud model demonstrates the effects of limb - brightening and differences in the physical sizes of the , , and co zones on the observed line strengths .",
    "the , [ ] , and  line intensities from the plane - parallel cloud model are not very sensitive to the metallicity .",
    "when geometric effects are taken into account using spherical models , the , and [ ] line intensities normalized to the far - ir intensity are also not very sensitive to the metallicity ; however , the  intensity is proportional to the surface area of the co core . as we decrease the cloud size ( or total column density , @xmath248 ) , the co intensity normalized to the far - ir intensity decreases .",
    "we compiled data of  ,  , [ ] , and far - ir in the star formation regions in the magellanic clouds and in the galaxy , and compared them with simulated line intensities from a plane - parallel cloud .",
    "the data in the /  versus /  plot agree with the model results , and show no significant difference between the magellanic clouds and the galaxy .",
    "we use the /  versus /  plot to estimate @xmath151 and  at the positions we observed . in the /  versus /  plot and the /  versus /  plot ,",
    "the data from the western edge zone in ngc 2024 and from the magellanic clouds are shifted to the lower  than the model results , which can be explained as an effect of spherical geometry .",
    "we measured the amount of the effect , and used the result to derive the column density through the clouds .    on galaxy scales , the derived average column density and therefore size of the clouds appears to increase as the metallicity of the galaxy decreases .",
    "our observational result , that the mean extinction of clouds is constant and independent of their metallicity , is consistent with the idea that photoionization may play a role in regulating star formation .",
