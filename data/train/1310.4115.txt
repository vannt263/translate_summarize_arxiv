    ", @xmath11 may not be , so that perturbative analysis can fail when @xmath12 .",
    "one of the most profound physical effects predicted to take place in this regime is the instability of the ground state ( the vacuum ) against creation of electron - positron pairs , resulting in a screening space charge of electrons with positrons leaving physical picture @xcite .",
    "experimental study of this effect has not been possible , as stable nuclei with @xmath13 have not been created , and attempts to look for positron production in a temporarily created overcritical system of slowly colliding uranium nuclei have not been successful @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to demonstrate that in the condensed matter setting the corresponding problems are the impurity states in narrow - band gap semiconductors ( nbgs ) @xcite and weyl semimetals ( ws ) @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these systems is that the charges and fields required to see the ground state instability are modest and readily achievable . some of the effects may have already been seen @xcite without fully appreciating what they represent .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows :    in section ii the phenomenon of critical charge is first explained heuristically ( iia ) followed by more precise semiclassical argument ( iib ) that relates the effect to that of quantum - mechanical fall to the center @xcite .",
    "then the critical charge problem for the coulomb potential modified at small distances is analyzed via dimensional analysis ( iic ) which in section iii is employed to demonstrate the feasibility of observation of its condensed matter analog , instability with respect to creation of electron - hole pairs in semiconductors .    in section",
    "iv thomas - fermi ( tf ) theory of screening by space charge is derived and its deficiencies and a modification are discussed .",
    "one of the by - products of the analysis is the conclusion that the observable charge of an arbitrary overcritical source in the ws case is always given by the reciprocal of the inverse fine structure constant for the material .    in sections v and vi the tf theory",
    "is solved in two steps - uniformly charged half - space @xmath14 spherically symmetric charge distribution - so that the existence of several physically different regimes of screening can be appreciated , and to establish a relationship with previous analysis @xcite .",
    "the tf analysis leads to the conclusion that there is total screening in the ws case , through an argument that is parallel to landau s `` zero charge effect '' in qed @xcite .",
    "this would have readily observable consequences .",
    "however , we will argue in section vii that this claim of complete screening is not right , so that there after all can be an observable charge .",
    "the dirac equation for an electron in vacuum in the field of a point charge @xmath0 ( the dirac - kepler problem ) becomes invalid for @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this feature can be heuristically understood by starting with classical expression for the energy of an electron of mass @xmath16 and momentum @xmath17 in the field of charge @xmath0 @xmath18 and trying to estimate the ground - state energy . since the electron position can not be determined to better than @xmath19 divided by the uncertainty of momentum , @xmath17 and @xmath20 entering eq.([cl_energy ] )",
    "may be regarded as the typical momentum and size of the quantum state , respectively .",
    "then the state energy can be estimated as @xmath21 where @xmath22 measures the nuclear charge in units of the reciprocal of the fine structure constant @xmath23 ; both these `` natural '' units ( lower case letters ) and the usual units for charge ( upper case letters ) will be used throughout this paper . minimizing with respect to the free parameter @xmath17 we find @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the electron compton wavelength that sets",
    "the scale for the uncertainty of measurement of the electron position and @xmath26 is the classical electron radius .",
    "the lowest ( ground - state ) energy is then @xmath27 while reproducing the well - known ground - state properties of a hydrogen - like atom in the non - relativistic @xmath28 limit ( [ gs_properties ] ) , as well as ( coincidentally ) matching the exact expression for the ground - state energy ( [ gs_energy ] ) based on the analysis of the dirac equation @xcite , these arguments also predict that the minimum of ( [ energy_vs_p ] ) only exists for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "as @xmath31 , the ground state becomes sharply localized ( @xmath32 ) , the typical electron momentum diverges ( @xmath33 ) , and the ground - state energy vanishes ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the conclusions ( [ gs_properties])-([gs_energy ] ) become meaningless for @xmath35 ; specifically the ground state energy is predicted to become imaginary .",
    "the counterintuitive independence of @xmath36 of the electron mass @xmath16 can be explained via dimensional analysis :    the dirac - kepler problem is fully specified by the dimensionless parameter @xmath22 , and by the electron compton wavelength @xmath25 in ( [ gs_properties ] ) .",
    "if there exists a critical value of the charge @xmath36 , it can only be a function of the remaining independent dimensionless parameters of the problem .",
    "however having only one length scale @xmath25 available makes it impossible to use it in a dimensionless combination .",
    "therefore @xmath36 can not depend on @xmath25 , and thus on the electron mass @xmath16 ; the only possible outcome is @xmath37 .",
    "these observations imply that the @xmath38 anomaly of the dirac - kepler problem persists in the weyl - kepler problem ( @xmath39 ) , where the estimate ( [ energy_vs_p ] ) becomes @xmath40 as a result , a charged weyl fermion placed in the field of a point charge with @xmath29 is always delocalized ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ) ; the spectrum is not discrete ( i.e. no bound states ) . on the other hand , a sufficiently attractive charge",
    "@xmath38 leads to a sharply localized ground state ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ) .",
    "the @xmath38 instability in the dirac - kepler problem can be identified with a strong field limit of the schwinger effect @xcite : the creation of electron - positron pairs in vacuum in a uniform electric field .",
    "the phenomenon is characterized by the schwinger typical electric field @xmath47 for which the work to separate the constituents of the electron - positron pair over the length scale of the compton wavelength is equal to the rest energy of the pair : @xmath48 : @xmath49 for @xmath50 the pairs are created by tunneling with the vacuum being in a metastable state while for @xmath51 the vacuum is absolutely unstable with respect to pair creation . for the coulomb problem the instability sets in when the electric field of the nucleus a compton wavelength away from its center , @xmath52 , reaches the order of magnitude of the schwinger field ( [ schwinger ] ) , thus predicting @xmath37 . in view of its mass independence",
    ", the prediction @xmath53 also applies to the weyl - kepler problem .",
    "the @xmath54 anomaly of the dirac equation is related to the `` fall to the center '' effect of quantum mechanics @xcite .    for a classical electron of energy @xmath55 and angular momentum",
    "@xmath56 moving in a central field @xmath57 the equation of conservation of energy can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the square of total momentum and @xmath60 is the radial component of the momentum .",
    "the particle can reach the origin ( `` fall to the center '' ) if @xcite @xmath61 specifically for zero angular momentum @xmath56 the fall to the center occurs for any attractive potential decreasing faster than @xmath62 as @xmath63 . in quantum mechanics",
    "@xmath64 has to be replaced by the eigenvalues of the square of the angular momentum operator which will be chosen in the semi - classical langer form @xmath65 @xcite so that both the effects of zero - point motion ( @xmath66 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath67 ) are accounted for .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath64 is @xmath68 which implies that the fall to the center can occur for @xmath62 potentials that are more attractive than the critical potential satisfying @xcite @xmath69 when this condition is met there is no lower bound on the spectrum .    for relativistic classical particle moving in a central field ,",
    "energy and momentum are related by @xmath70 . for bound states we have @xmath71 , where beyond the lower limit the system is unstable against pair creation . at the lower limit",
    "the range of motion can be found by solving for the radial momentum to obtain a form analogous to eq.([nr_energy_conservation ] ) : @xmath72 if @xmath57 is diverging as @xmath63 , the @xmath73 term dominates , and for attractive @xmath57 the origin can be reached if @xcite @xmath74 classically the fall to the center for the @xmath75 state is possible for a potential that at @xmath63 is more attractive than a @xmath76 potential .",
    "the quantum case is different : substituting in ( [ r_confition_to_fall ] ) minimal @xmath77 we infer that the fall to the center is possible for @xmath76 potentials more attractive than the critical potential @xmath78 comparing with the coulomb field @xmath79 , we deduce @xmath80 which is the correct critical charge of the kepler problem for a spinless particle @xcite .",
    "it is half the value found for the dirac particle ( the `` missing '' half is due to the electron spin ) .",
    "the dirac case can not be fully understood semi - classically but an insight can be gained by observing that the relativistic case with @xmath81 is equivalent to a non - relativistic problem with the effective potential ( compare eqs.([nr_energy_conservation ] ) and ( [ r_energy_conservation ] ) ) @xmath82 and zero total energy .",
    "we now see that for the kepler problem , @xmath83 , the particle is _ repelled _ at large distances .",
    "the same effective potential is obtained from the klein - gordon equation transformed into the schrdinger form @xcite .",
    "the dirac equation can be also brought into a schrdinger form with an effective potential at @xmath81 resembling eq.([eff_potential ] ) but also exhibiting extra terms attributed to the electron spin @xcite .",
    "their role can be ( approximately ) summarized in a form similar to eq.([eff_potential ] ) with different amplitude of the @xmath62 term .",
    "specifically for the dirac - kepler problem we have @xcite @xmath84 we see that the fall to the center occurs for @xmath54 and then the particle is confined to the central region of radius @xmath85    as is the case of the fall to the center problem , proper treatment of the instability of the dirac equation requires accounting for finite radius @xmath86 of atomic nucleus that modifies the @xmath76 attraction at short distances and removes the difficulty for @xmath38 @xcite . for a nucleus with @xmath87 ( @xmath88 )",
    "the ground - state energy reaches the boundary of the lower continuum , @xmath89 @xcite . past that point",
    "the total energy of the production of an electron - positron pair becomes negative and the vacuum becomes unstable with respect to pair creation ; the positron repelled by the nucleus escapes to infinity while the electron remains near the nucleus @xcite .",
    "many of the conclusions of previous analysis of the critical charge problem that accounted for finite radius @xmath86 of atomic nucleus @xcite can be reproduced by a combination of dimensional analysis and simple physical arguments .",
    "indeed now we have a problem fully specified by independent dimensionless combinations @xmath3 , @xmath10 , and @xmath90 .",
    "then if there exists a critical value @xmath4 , it can only be a function of @xmath10 and @xmath90 .",
    "the electrostatic potential inside the nucleus has the form : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is finite .",
    "then the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath10 appear together in the @xmath94 combination .",
    "therefore @xmath95 or @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a function that depends on the shape of the charge distribution within the nucleus . the properties of @xmath97 can be inferred from the following arguments :    \\(i ) for @xmath98 one has @xmath99 which implies the small argument behavior @xmath100 .",
    "this additionally means that @xmath99 for @xmath39 for arbitrary @xmath86 ( the weyl - kepler problem with cutoff ) .",
    "\\(ii ) in the classical @xmath101 limit the planck s constant must drop out of eq.([dim_analysis ] ) .",
    "this translates into the large argument behavior @xmath102 with the consequence @xmath103 .",
    "this is indeed what is expected on physical grounds : the vacuum becomes unstable when the electron potential energy at the center of the nucleus @xmath104 reaches the boundary of the lower energy continuum @xmath105 .",
    "this argument applied to the uniformly charged ball model of the nucleus predicts @xmath106 . on the other hand , @xmath107 for the constant potential ball model of the nucleus .    for ordinary heavy nuclei the nuclear size @xmath86 depends on @xmath3 according to the fermi formula @xmath108 the critical charge @xmath36",
    "is found by simultaneous solution of eqs.([dim_analysis_zeta ] ) and ( [ nucl_matter ] ) for @xmath109 : @xmath110    the electron compton wavelength is known to be much larger than the nuclear size which means the argument of the function @xmath111 in eq.([fermi_model_electron ] ) is much smaller than unity . in this limit",
    "the distinction between different models of nuclear charge distribution disappears thus explaining the nearly model - independent value of @xmath36 close to @xmath112 .    to add credibility to dimensional analysis we now show that the latter easily solves the problem of instability of the muon vacuum .",
    "indeed , the muon compton wavelength has the same order of magnitude as the nuclear size since the muon is more than @xmath113 times heavier than the electron .",
    "the solution to the problem is then described by eq.([dim_analysis ] ) with the electron mass @xmath16 replaced by the muon mass @xmath114 .",
    "we are now in the large argument limit , @xmath102 , which determines the critical @xmath3 for the muon to be @xmath115    these conclusions agree with existing analysis of the problem @xcite .",
    "in fact we observe that approximating the true @xmath97 dependence for _ all _ @xmath116 by its @xmath117 limit @xcite @xmath118 suffices to quickly estimate the critical charge in the practically relevant case of the uniform density model of the nucleus . in the @xmath119 limit , where this approximation is expected to work poorly",
    ", the combination of eqs.([fermi_model_electron ] ) and ( [ choice_of_f ] ) predicts @xmath120 which is close to the accepted value of @xmath121 .",
    "inspection of previous results @xcite shows that , except for a narrow vicinity of @xmath122 , the function @xmath97 is basically a straight line of the right slope with a larger - than - unity offset .",
    "the significance of the linear approximation ( [ choice_of_f ] ) is that it allows us to reliably estimate the critical charge in the condensed matter setting .",
    "qed s predictions of screening by space charge can be tested in performable experiments involving condensed matter systems , both presently available and those that will become available in the near future .",
    "our primary example is that of nbgs whose physics is known to mimic qed @xcite .",
    "excitation of an electron - hole pair is analogous to the creation of an electron - positron pair in qed , with the band gap representing the combined rest energy of the particles .",
    "creation of the electron - hole pairs in the presence of a uniform electric field takes place via zener tunneling @xcite which is analogous to the schwinger effect @xcite .",
    "our contention is that moderately charged impurity regions in semiconductors can trigger a space charge around them that parallels the effects that would occur in qed for unrealistically large @xmath123 .",
    "the idea that the @xmath124 anomaly of the original dirac - kepler problem may have observable condensed matter implications is due to keldysh @xcite . in his study of the impurity states in semiconductors",
    "keldysh noted that the effective mass approximation @xcite , while successful in describing shallow impurity states , fails to explain deep states whose binding energy is comparable with the band gap .",
    "such states are formed near multi - charged impurity centers , vacancies etc . and they can not be associated with either conduction or valence bands .",
    "the experiment presented another puzzle : some highly charged impurities acted as very efficient recombination centers that managed to trap both electrons and holes but an explanation why that was the case was lacking .",
    "keldysh argued that experimental findings can be explained in a two - band approximation ( well obeyed in nbgs of the @xmath125 type ) where the low - energy electron ( hole ) dispersion law is relativistic @xcite @xmath126 here the upper and lower signs correspond to the conduction and valence bands , respectively , @xmath127 is the energy band gap that parallels twice the rest energy of a particle of mass @xmath128 , and @xmath129 is the velocity of a high - momentum particle analogous to the speed of light @xmath130 . compared to their vacuum electron - positron counterparts , electrons and holes in nbgs have two orders of magnitude smaller effective mass ( @xmath131 ) and limiting velocity @xmath129 nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the speed of light ( @xmath132 ) . as a result",
    "their band gap @xmath133 is seven orders of magnitude smaller than the rest energy of the electron - positron pair @xcite . due to these parameter values",
    "the analog of large field qed effects are readily realizable in nbgs .    with this in mind , the determination of the impurity states reduces to solving the dirac equation for a particle of mass @xmath128 in the field of a charge @xmath0 screened by the dielectric constant @xmath134 of the semiconductor . in view of the peculiarity of the dirac - kepler problem ( now @xmath135 ) , keldysh argued that for @xmath136 the impurity states are given by the known solution to the dirac equation @xcite while the @xmath38 case with `` collapsed '' ground state describes a recombination center .",
    "an expression for the nbgs critical charge can be written in a form that parallels eq.([dim_analysis_zeta ] ) : @xmath137 where now @xmath86 is the radius of the impurity region , @xmath138 is the semiconductor analog of the electron compton wavelength and @xmath139 is the semiconductor counterpart of the classical electron radius ( defined as band electron s delocalization size at which its potential self - energy @xmath140 matches its rest energy @xmath141 .",
    "we note that since both @xmath142 and @xmath143 significantly exceed the lattice spacing , macroscopic theory of impurity states ignoring the lattice structure of the material suffices .",
    "the density of nuclear matter is known to have the order of magnitude set by the classical electron radius @xmath144 ( see eq.([nucl_matter ] ) ) .",
    "it will be made clear shortly , that the large field effects in nbgs become prominent at impurity charge densities set by the nbgs electron radius @xmath145 .",
    "therefore the relationship between the radius @xmath86 and the charge @xmath3 of a uniformly charged region will be chosen as @xmath146 that parallels its nuclear physics counterpart ( [ nucl_matter ] ) ; the numerical factor corresponds to the charge density @xmath147 to be justified below .",
    "the nbgs critical charge can be determined by solving the equation @xmath148 that is nearly identical to its qed counterpart ( [ fermi_model_electron ] ) . because the value of the limiting velocity @xmath129 is known",
    ", the semiconductor equivalent of the fine structure constant is @xmath149 , an order of magnitude larger than its qed counterpart ( we employed @xmath150 @xcite ) . with this value of @xmath10 and choosing the function @xmath97 in the simple form ( [ choice_of_f ] ) , the solution to eq.([sc_unif_den_model ] ) is @xmath151 which implies @xmath152 .",
    "the corresponding critical cluster size is @xmath153 according to eq.([sc_matter ] ) . surely @xmath154 impurity clusters with sizes in excess of several nanometers are more common objects than @xmath123 nuclei .",
    "in addition to making it possible to study the regime of large effective fine structure constant , condensed matter systems also offer possibilities that can not be realized in qed .",
    "indeed , over forty years ago abrikosov and beneslavski @xcite predicted the existence of ws having points in the brillouin zone where the valence and conduction bands meet with a dispersion law that is linear in the momentum .",
    "this is the @xmath155 case of eq.([dispersion ] ) .",
    "the low - energy excitations in ws ( realizing massless versions of qed ) are described by the weyl equation .",
    "we already know that the critical charge for the weyl - kepler problem is @xmath99 .",
    "eq.([m=0_energy ] ) additionally implies lack of the discrete spectrum for @xmath156 ; for @xmath38 , a space charge of weyl fermions is present in the ground state .",
    "such substances are likely to be realized in doped silver chalcogenides @xmath157 and @xmath158 @xcite , pyrochlore iridates @xmath159 ( where @xmath160 is yttrium or a lanthanide ) @xcite , and in topological insulator multilayer structures @xcite .",
    "the zero energy gap of ws implies that in a _ uniform _ electric field the creation of a space charge of weyl fermions is spontaneous .",
    "the dielectric constant of ws is of order @xmath161 with @xmath162 @xcite , thus leading , like in the nbgs case , to @xmath163 independent of the size of the impurity region .",
    "nbgs and ws are condensed matter systems where analogs of the atomic collapse of qed can be experimentally detected .",
    "related phenomena can be also observed in graphene .",
    "indeed , graphene possesses the linear dispersion law analogous to that of ws and microscopic parameters similar to nbgs which leads to a small value for the critical charge for promotion of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band .",
    "such a problem has been considered elsewhere @xcite and experimental signatures of the `` atomic collapse '' in graphene were recently reported @xcite .",
    "the graphene problem is mathematically different from what we discuss , because graphene is a two - dimensional semimetal embedded in a three - dimensional space .    below we will determine the ground - state properties of nbgs and ws in the presence of a finite - size positive coulomb impurity ( a negative charge leads to the same discussion due to particle - hole symmetry ) .",
    "the arguments given above imply that at modest @xmath3 electrons are promoted from the valence band to form a space charge around the impurity while the holes leave the physical picture ; the properties of the space charge vary with @xmath3 and @xmath10 and are determined by the interplay of attraction to the impurity ( promoting the creation of electron - hole pairs ) , and electron - electron repulsion combined with the pauli principle ( limiting the creation of the space charge ) .",
    "the qed analysis of the physical properties of the space charge was carried out in two limits :    \\(i ) @xmath3 close to @xmath4 , where there are very few electrons promoted to the conduction band for which the single - particle picture is a good starting point @xcite ; and    \\(ii ) @xmath164 , where the number of screening electrons is large and the electron - electron interactions can not be ignored @xcite .",
    "below we demonstrate that the physics in the @xmath164 limit exhibits a large degree of universality .",
    "although we are mostly concerned with the nbgs setting , our findings are equally applicable in qed as both problems share the same mathematics ; a solution to the ws problem benefits the understanding of the nbgs / qed case .    to help the readers orient themselves between three physically different manifestations of the problem and to provide them with a condensed matter - qed translation dictionary , in table i we summarized pertinent properties of electrons in vacua of qed , nbgs and ws .",

    "since for @xmath164 a large number of electrons are in the conduction band , the properties of the system consisting of the impurity and its interacting cloud of electrons can be understood semi - classically with the help of the tf theory @xcite .",
    "the main object of the latter is a physical electrostatic potential @xmath172 felt by an electron that is due to both the electrostatic potential of the impurity @xmath173 and that of the space charge characterized by the number density @xmath174 : @xmath175 the external potential @xmath173 is a pseudopotential that represents the perturbation of the system caused by the impurity ; even though @xmath176 is not entirely of electrostatic origin , we will define @xmath177 .",

    "should not exceed a volt .",

    "this choice additionally guarantees that the results of section vb2 pertinent to the nbgs / qed case are automatically captured .    substituting @xmath440 into eqs.([def_chi ] ) and ( [ n_of_phi ] )",
    "we find corresponding interpolation formulas for the potential @xmath441 and the electron density @xmath442^{3/2}}\\ ] ] the logarithmic terms in the denominators of eqs.([interpolation_charge])-([interpolation_density ] ) are relevant at the scales @xmath215 exceeding @xmath443 this quantity is the screening length within the space charge of weyl electrons .",
    "deviations from the coulomb law become substantial for @xmath444 and the asymptotic regimes of eqs.([0_charge_solution])-([w_density_strong_screening ] ) are reached at @xmath445 . specifically , as the strength of screening increases from small to large @xmath251 the screening radius ( [ shell_screening_length ] ) decreases from a very large value to the scale comparable to the source size .    since the zero charge effect is an artifact , consistency of the theory requires that the screening length ( [ shell_screening_length ] ) to be significantly shorter than the radius of the electron cloud ( [ w_cloud_size ] ) . since @xmath237 this is indeed true",
    ".      the nbgs / qed case will be handled in exactly the same manner as that of the regime of moderately strong screening - by terminating the ws solution at the scale of the space charge region ( [ termination_point ] ) .",
    "then the observable charge follows from eq.([interpolation_charge ] ) as @xmath446 we see that the initial growth of @xmath447 as @xmath22 , in the regime of weak screening @xmath448 , slows down eventually saturating , in the strong screening regime @xmath449 , at @xmath22-independent value implied by eq.([selfcons_obs_charge_eq ] ) . in the regime of weak",
    "screening the solution to eq.([sc_interpolation_charge ] ) one step beyond the zero order @xmath450 $ ] reproduces previous findings @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the observable charge @xmath2 of a supercharged heavy nucleus on the bare charge @xmath3 was evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite by numerically solving the tf theory discussed in our paper .",
    "the @xmath451-dependence was found to be a monotonically increasing function with growth rate decreasing with @xmath3 ; for @xmath452 the function @xmath451 was found to grow slower than @xmath3 .",
    "the mvp theory @xcite explained the @xmath451 behavior in the regime of weak screening @xmath453 and laid out a foundation to understand the regime of strong screening @xmath250 ; its place in the problem of screening of overcritical external charge was explained earlier .",
    "however the zero - charge type solution of the tf theory in the ws case was missed whose consequences are :    \\(i ) for @xmath86 fixed the observable charge @xmath2 saturates as @xmath452 at a @xmath3-independent value ;    \\(ii ) for realistic @xmath385 the @xmath451 dependence is a nearly universal slowly increasing function of @xmath3 , eq.([obs_charge_strong_screening ] ) , which goes beyond explanation of numerical results @xcite .",
    "even though in the nbgs / qed case complete screening does not occur , there are other respects in which the tf theory is internally inconsistent . solving eq.([sc_interpolation_charge ] ) for the bare charge @xmath22 we find @xmath454 while correctly predicting that the latter is always larger than the observable charge , eq.([landau_pole ] ) also tells us that for fixed @xmath221 and @xmath229 the denominator vanishes for finite @xmath86 given by @xmath455 before the limit of point source is reached . at @xmath456",
    "the bare charge is infinite while for @xmath457 it is imaginary ; the latter feature is certainly unacceptable .",
    "these conclusions having their origin in the `` zero charge '' solution in the ws case , like the zero charge effect itself , are artifacts . even if the vanishing of the observable charge did occur , the scale ( [ pole_position ] ) is too small to be of any practical importance .",
    "in section iva we introduced a modified tf equation ( [ modified_tf ] ) with built - in quantum - mechanical fall to the center .",
    "it is straightforward to realize that such a modification removes the zero charge effect in the ws case ; the nbgs / qed problems are also liberated of the difficulty of the vanishing denominator .",
    "specifically , in the ws ( @xmath210 ) case substituting ( [ def_chi ] ) into ( [ modified_tf ] ) we obtain ( instead of ( [ gl ] ) ) the following flow equation @xmath458 now any `` initial '' charge @xmath459 will be carried to the stable fixed point @xmath460 which is reached as @xmath461 .",
    "eq.([w_flow_eq ] ) can be integrated in quadratures for arbitrary initial @xmath22 with the result @xmath462 where the scale @xmath463 is determined by the condition @xmath464 .",
    "the corresponding spatial scale @xmath465 characterizes the size of the space charge cloud .",
    "for @xmath363 the ( overcritical ) impurity charge appears as being poised at the critical value . as @xmath466 ( a weakly overcritical source ) ,",
    "the cloud size ( [ better_w_cloud_size ] ) diverges because the creation of spacial charge is a critical phenomenon .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless - type essential singularity in ( [ better_w_cloud_size ] ) is typical of localization transitions related to the quantum - mechanical fall to the center @xcite . for the supercritical source",
    "@xmath237 the cloud size becomes eq.([w_cloud_size ] ) .",
    "the point source limit @xmath229 ( @xmath467 ) of the solution ( [ better_w_solution ] ) also describes the nbgs / qed problems with the conclusion that at arbitrary distance @xmath215 from overcritical point source the observable charge of the latter is unity .",
