    "random matrices of infinitely increasing dimensions are of the rapidly growing interest because of their numerous applications and deep relations with various branches of modern mathematics and physics ( see review @xcite and monograph @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this can be explained by fairly wide universality of spectral properties of random matrix ensembles , in particular , the asymptotic universality of the local eigenvalue statistics in the bulk and at the border of the limiting spectra .",
    "the spectral theory of random matrices has been started by the work of @xcite , where the limiting eigenvalue distribution of the ensemble of @xmath0 random real symmetric matrices of the form @xmath10 was considered .",
    "random variables @xmath11 are jointly independent and have symmetric probability distribution . assuming that that the variance of all random variables @xmath9 is equal to @xmath3 and that all moments of @xmath9 exist , e. wigner had proved the convergence @xmath12 where @xmath13 with real eigenvalues @xmath14 , @xmath15 . here and below",
    "@xmath16 denotes the mathematical expectation with respect to the family @xmath17",
    ". showed that @xmath18 represent the moments of the measure with the density of the form @xmath19 with the support @xmath20 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this measure is referred to as the semicircle distribution and convergence ( 1.1 ) is known as the wigner or the semicircle law @xcite .    in the particular case , when @xmath9 are given by real independent gaussian random variables , the the family @xmath21 is referred to as the gaussian orthogonal ensemble abbreviated as goe .",
    "the corresponding ensemble of hermitian random matrices is known as the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) @xcite . in these cases",
    "the variance of the diagonal elements @xmath22 is different with respect to those of the random matrices studied by e. wigner .",
    "the famous tracy - widom law says that the probability distribution of the maximal eigenvalue of goe matrices converges , when rescaled , to a probability distribution known as the tracy - widom distribution @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the same result is valid for the maximal eigenvalue of gue matrices with @xmath25 replaced by another function @xmath26 .",
    "taking into account a large number of strong and deep connections between the local eigenvalue distribution of the form ( 1.3 ) of the gue and goe random matrices from one side and the probability distribution of a number of combinatorial and probabilistic objects ( see for example papers and reviews @xcite and references therein ) , the universality of the local spectral distribution can be considered as the most fundamental issue in the spectral theory of random matrices .",
    "the universality conjecture put forward in theoretical physics studies , has found its mathematical form in the proposition that the probability distribution of finite number of nearest neighbor eigenvalues is asymptotically independent on the probability distribution of the ensemble @xmath21 ( see @xcite for precise formulations , historical perspective and main references ) . in present paper , we obtain the upper bound for the probability @xmath27 for large class of random matrices @xmath1 whose elements @xmath9 are not necessarily the normally distributed random variables .",
    "the bound we obtain is of the universal form in the sense that it does not depend on the details of the probability distribution of @xmath9 .",
    "the universality properties at the bulk of the spectrum of wigner random matrices @xmath1 has been recently established in a series of works ( see @xcite and references therein ) by the means of the resolvent approach . to get the results of the form ( 1.3 ) at the border of the spectrum of wigner random matrices , one can use the moments @xmath28 ( 1.2 ) with high infinitely increasing order @xmath29 as @xmath30 .    in papers",
    "@xcite , a powerful approach has been proposed and elaborated by ya .",
    "sinai and a. soshnikov to study the mean values of the traces @xmath31 of @xmath1 and their correlation functions in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "this approach is based on the representation of the mean value @xmath33 as the sum over weighted trajectories @xmath34 of @xmath35 steps that can have a number of self - intersections .",
    "the upper bounds for @xmath36 and the central limit theorems for @xmath37 were established in these papers for the asymptotic regimes when @xmath38 .    in the subsequent paper @xcite , the asymptotic regime @xmath39 necessary to prove the statements of the form ( 1.3 ) has been reached . in @xcite ,",
    "the limiting correlation functions of @xmath37 have been studied under hypothesis that the moments of @xmath9 are bounded as follows @xmath40 to relax the condition ( 1.4 ) , a. ruzmaikina @xcite has further specified the method proposed by sinai - soshnikov . in @xcite , the polynomial decay of the probability distribution of @xmath9 is assumed such that @xmath41 it was also indicated that in paper @xcite , a certain part of the sum that correspond to trajectories @xmath34 with large number of steps out from the same site has not been correctly estimated and the improved bound has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the reasoning of @xcite contains two doubtful points .",
    "the first problem is related with the condition ( 1.5 ) . to get the estimates announced in @xcite by using the method proposed , one should double the exponential 18 .",
    "the second and more serious gap is not related with conditions ( 1.4 ) or ( 1.5 ) .",
    "it concerns the properties of the trajectories mentioned above that have many steps out from the same site .",
    "following @xcite , it is claimed in @xcite that the presence of such sites can happen in two situations .",
    "the first one arises when the underlying dyck path ( or equivalently , the related plane rooted tree ) contains vertices of high degree ; in the opposite case , these sites can be created by the arrivals to them along the ascending steps of the dyck paths .",
    "however , the third possibility , complementary to the two first ones , has not been detected in @xcite and the studies of @xcite do not cover the whole set of trajectories . this third complementary possibility is given by the case when the trajectory creates the sites with large number of exit steps after arrivals at these sites by descending steps of the corresponding dyck path .",
    "this can happen when the trajectory performs a number of fractures of the tree structure of walk before these arrivals by descending steps .",
    "in paper @xcite , we have studied in details this type of walks with broken tree structure and completed the sinai - soshnikov method .",
    "the example case of random matrices with bounded random variables has been considered in @xcite ; also a way to study the case when @xmath9 has a finite number of moments has been indicated .    in present paper ,",
    "we introduce a new modified version of the sinai - soshnikov approach completed in @xcite and consider random matrix ensemble @xmath21 more general conditions than ( 1.5 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present our main results and describe the scheme of the proof . in section 3 ,",
    "we give rigorous description of the trajectories , walks and their graphs .",
    "the notions of open simple self - intersections introduced in @xcite is generalized to meet requirements of our technique . in section 4 , we prove our main technical results and obtain the upper bound for the sequence of moments of random matrices with truncated random variables .",
    "section 5 contains the background facts and auxiliary results . in section 6",
    ", we discuss relations between the universality of the upper bounds obtained and those of the correlation functions . in section 7 , we apply the technique developed to the ensemble of large dilute random matrices .",
    "the summary and discussion are given in",
    "let us consider the ensemble @xmath21 of @xmath0 real symmetric random matrices with elements @xmath42 where the family of jointly independent identically distributed random determined on the same probability space @xmath43 is such that @xmath44 here and below we denote by @xmath16 the mathematical expectation with respect to the measure @xmath45 .",

    "it is known @xcite that the cardinality @xmath73 is given by the catalan number that we denote by @xmath74 .",
    "the bound ( 2.7 ) with @xmath67 determined by the right - hand side of ( 2.8 ) has been used for the first time in the context of random matrix theory in @xcite ; convergence ( 2.8 ) is rigorously proved in @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the limit ( 2.8 ) exists and coincides with the exponential moment of the normalized brownian excursion on @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "the bound ( 2.7 ) is not universal in the sense that @xmath76 , where the choice of @xmath77 depends on the value of @xmath78 ( see relation ( 4.30 ) ) .",
    "however , the nature of the leading contribution to the left - hand side of ( 2.7 ) is such that it does not contain the values @xmath79 .",

    "when @xmath97 , on gets the gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices .",
    "let us briefly describe the scheme of the proof of theorem 2.2 . here",
    "we use a completed and modified version of the technique proposed by ya .",
    "sinai and @xcite and further developed by a. ruzmaikina @xcite .",
    "the approach is based on the wigner s original point of view when the trace of the power of random matrix ( 2.1 ) is represented as the weighted sum @xmath98 where the sequence @xmath34 is regarded as a closed trajectory of @xmath35 steps @xmath99 and the weight @xmath100 is given by the average value of the product of corresponding random variables @xmath9 .",
    "it is natural to say that the subscripts of the variables @xmath101 of ( 2.11 ) represent the values of the discrete time , @xmath102 .",
    "assuming that the probability distribution of @xmath9 is symmetric , the non - zero contribution to the right - had side of ( 2.10 ) comes from the trajectories @xmath103 whose weight @xmath104 contains each random variable @xmath9 with even multiplicity . in @xcite ,",
    "these trajectories were referred to as the even ones .",
    "regarding the even walks , one can define the marked instants of time that correspond to instants , when each random variable is seen for the odd number of times .",
    "the principal idea of the sinai - soshnikov method is to separate the set of all possible even trajectories @xmath105 into the classes of equivalence determined by the number of vertices of the self - intersections of one or another degree .",
    "the vertex of self - intersection is determined as the site @xmath106 that is seen at the marked instants several times during the whole run .",
    "the number @xmath107 of such arrivals is called the self - intersection degree of the vertex .",
    "important role here is played by the vertices of two - fold self - intersections of the special kind that are called the open two - fold self - intersections .",
    "a. ruzmaikina has shown that the vertices of self - intersection of high degree @xmath108 can be neglected , where @xmath109 depends on the order of the maximal existing moment of the random variables @xmath9 . in paper @xcite",
    ", the approach of sinai - soshnikov - ruzmaikina has been completed by the rigorous study of the walks with open instants of self - intersections of any degree .",
    "the classes of walks with self - intersections introduced in @xcite represent a powerful tool to get precise estimates of the number of trajectories while the weights of these are taken into account with less accuracy . in the present paper ,",
    "we further modify the technique by ya .",
    "sinai and a. soshnikov by using new more informative classes of equivalence .",
    "the main idea is to separate the first - passage steps from those that produce the high degrees of variables @xmath9 .",
    "this allows us to count the number of elements in the classes of equivalence with the same precision as before and at the same time to give more adequate account on the weight of the corresponding walks . due to this improvement",
    ", one can relax the moment conditions with respect to those imposed on random variables @xmath9 in @xcite and @xcite and consider more general ensembles of random matrices than that given by the wigner ensemble . as an immediate application ,",
    "the ensemble of dilute random matrices can be studied in details .",
    "in the present section we introduce classes of equivalences of trajectories @xmath34 ( 2.10 ) and develop a method to estimate the cardinalities of these classes .",
    "to do this , we determine and generalize the notions used in the frameworks of the sinai - soshnikov approach .    in subsection 3.1 , we give the definitions of walks and graphs . in subsection 3.2",
    ", we describe the sinai - soshnikov classes of equivalence and present the notion of the generalized open instant of self - intersection proposed in @xcite .",
    "further modification of the sinai - soshnikov classes is presented in subsection 3.3 . in subsection 3.4",
    ", the number of walks in these new classes of equivalence is estimated .",
    "regarding @xmath34 ( 2.11 ) , we write that @xmath110 for integer @xmath111 $ ] and say that the couple @xmath112 represent the step number @xmath113 of the trajectory @xmath34 . let us consider the set @xmath114 and denote by @xmath115 its cardinality .",
    "given a particular trajectory @xmath34 , we construct the _ walk of trajectory _",
