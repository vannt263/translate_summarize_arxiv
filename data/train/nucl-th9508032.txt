    "spectroscopy in the superdeformed minimum has reached a certain level of maturity to justify a phenomenological analysis of the available data ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "such an approach would be useful in systematizing the data and would also provide a complimentary perspective to the more microscopic theories . for this purpose , we use the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite which has been established as one of the simplest and most versatile collective models . it has been especially successful in correlating spectroscopic data in deformed nuclei in terms of a few parameters of a quadrupole hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "microscopic study of the nucleon pair structure in the superdeformed well @xcite indicates that , compared to the deformed nuclei , they have about three times more active pairs of nucleons ( bosons ) , and the @xmath1 pair ( @xmath2 boson ) plays a much more significant role . as numerical diagonalization of an @xmath3-ibm hamiltonian is not possible for more than 10 bosons , one needs alternative methods of solution to apply the ibm to superdeformed nuclei . here",
    ", we use the angular momentum projected mean field theory which leads to a @xmath0 expansion for all matrix elements of interest @xcite .",
    "accurate representation of high - spin states in the @xmath0 expansion formalism requires terms to order @xmath4 which have been obtained recently using computer algebra @xcite .",
    "the extended formalism provides an analytical method for analysis of superdeformed states which is both accurate and efficient .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . after reviewing the microscopic basis of the ibm for superdeformed nuclei , we introduce the @xmath0 expansion formalism and discuss its recent extension to higher orders .",
    "we then use the @xmath0 expansion formulas for a quadrupole hamiltonian to study systematic features of dynamic moment of inertia and @xmath5 values .",
    "the results are used in a description the superdeformed bands in the hg - pb and gd - dy regions .",
    "in this section , we study the typical structure of strongly deformed states and investigate the relation between the superdeformation and the ibm based on @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we use the nilsson + bcs model with particle number projection .",
    "superdeformed states can be characterized as ground states in a superdeformed potential well which is separated from the normal one by a potential barrier . for such ground - like states which show strongly collective nature",
    ", this model seems to work well . using the experimental deformation parameters and electric transition probabilities ( or moments ) as input",
    ", one can obtain reasonable wave functions .",
    "these wave functions are analyzed from the viewpoint of collective nucleon pairs , which leads to a natural extension of the usual ibm .",
    "we briefly summarize the formulation of the nilsson + particle - number - conserving bcs model .",
    "the single particle orbits in a deformed potential are described well by the nilsson hamiltonian @xcite @xmath6 \\nonumber \\\\         & - & 2\\hbar \\omega_{0 } \\kappa \\mbox{\\boldmath $ l$ } \\cdot          \\mbox{\\boldmath $ s$ } -\\hbar \\omega_{0 } \\kappa \\mu        ( \\mbox{\\boldmath $ l$}^{2}-\\langle \\mbox{\\boldmath $ l$}^{2 } \\rangle_{n}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the deformation parameter and @xmath8 denotes the legendre polynomial .",
    "the term @xmath9 is the expectation value of @xmath10 averaged over one major shell with the principal quantum number @xmath11 .",
    "the value of the oscillator frequency for a mass - a nucleus is determined from @xmath12 , which is about 7.1 mev for the superdeformed nuclei in the hg - pb region ( @xmath13 190 ) and 7.7mev for those in the dy - gd region ( @xmath13150 ) .",
    "we use the usual values for the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 which are 0.0637 , 0.60 for proton orbits and 0.0637 , 0.42 for neutron orbits , respectively @xcite . in order to include short range correlations ,",
    "the monopole pairing interaction is added to the nilsson hamiltonian @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the pairing strength parameter , and @xmath18 is a pair creation operator . here",
    "@xmath19 stands for the creation operator of a nucleon in the spherical single particle orbit @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denotes the time reversed state of @xmath20 .",
    "this hamiltonian is solved by the variation using a bcs wave function @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the creation operator for a nucleon in the deformed canonical ( nilsson ) orbit labeled by @xmath24 .",
    "the particle number conservation has been found to be important in the case of weak pairing correlations and also for moments of inertia of high spin states in the cranking calculation of the superdeformed states @xcite .",
    "thus we carry out the particle number projection before variation according to the method given in ref .",
    "the solution corresponds to the minimum of the number projected energy @xmath25 = \\frac{\\langle \\psi \\mid h p^{n } \\mid \\psi \\rangle }                     { \\langle \\psi \\mid p^{n } \\mid \\psi \\rangle},\\ ] ] where @xmath26 denotes the particle number projection operator .",
    "the deformation parameters of the superdeformed states in the hg - pb ( dy - gd ) region are given by @xmath27 0.40 ( 0.50 ) , which is equivalent to the axis ratio of 5:3 ( 2:1 ) . because of this strong deformation , it is insufficient to take only one active major shell and take into account the corrections due to the core - polarization effect through renormalization in one major shell",
    ". thus we first seek a suitable model space for description of superdeformed states . for simplicity",
    ", we turn off the pairing force which is not important for this purpose . we take @xmath28hg ( @xmath29=114 , @xmath30=80 ) and @xmath31dy ( @xmath29=86 , @xmath30=66 ) as examples of the hg - pb and the dy - gd regions , respectively .    in order to define the model space necessary for description of superdeformed states ,",
    "we utilize the intrinsic quadrupole moment @xmath32 .",
    "the intrinsic quadrupole moment is calculated in the space of all spherical orbits up to the principal quantum number @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath34 is increased until the value of @xmath32 is saturated to a good extent . from this procedure",
    "we obtain @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath32 for proton and neutron orbits are 19_b _ and 29_b _ for @xmath28hg , and 19_b _ and 27_b _ for @xmath31dy , respectively . note that the experimental values of @xmath32 are @xmath36 for @xmath31dy @xcite and @xmath37 for @xmath28hg @xcite , which are consistent with the present results if we take the bare charges , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we now consider the inert core of superdeformed states .",
    "the nilsson wave function is obtained by putting all nucleons in the nilsson orbits from the bottom .",
    "one nilsson orbit can be expanded as a linear combination of many spherical harmonic oscillator orbits , and the square of expansion coefficients gives the occupation probability of each spherical orbit .",
    "we expand all the occupied nilsson orbits and sum up all the occupation probabilities which belong to the same spherical orbits , to obtain the total occupation probability for a given spherical harmonic oscillator basis . due to the strong quadrupole field ,",
    "one nilsson orbit spreads over many spherical orbits .",
    "thus the orbits with very high single particle energy can gain some finite occupation probabilities , while the occupation of the orbits with small single particle energy may become incomplete .",
    "nevertheless several lower spherical orbits are occupied almost completely and can be considered as a new inert spherical core for the superdeformed states .",
    "note that we do not take the usual `` hole '' picture as it is meaningful only for states whose configuration are well described within one major shell .",
    "first consider the case of @xmath28hg . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the occupation probability of each spherical harmonic oscillator orbit is shown for neutrons ( a ) and protons ( b ) .",
    "the orbits are ordered according to their single particle energy at @xmath40 as @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the case of @xmath44 which simulates the deformation of normal oblate states is also shown for comparison . for normal deformation",
    ", it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1]-a that the occupation of the proton orbits is almost complete at @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , while the occupation probability is almost vanished for orbits above @xmath47 .",
    "these results suggest that we can consider the @xmath46 subshell as an inert core and three valence orbits ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) as active .",
    "this gives the valence proton number as @xmath51 . in the case of @xmath52 ,",
    "the proton orbits are almost completely occupied up to @xmath53 . above @xmath53 ,",
    "the occupation probability drops suddenly though it remains about 10@xmath54 over many orbits .",
    "clearly , one should incorporate the contributions of these high energy orbits .",
    "thus it is reasonable to take the @xmath53 spherical inert core and include quite many orbits above there as active valence orbits . in this case",
    "the valence proton number becomes @xmath55 .    in the same way",
    ", it can be seen form fig .",
    "[ fig1]-b that the spherical inert core for neutron orbits are @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) and 82 ( @xmath58 ) for @xmath44 and 0.40 , respectively .",
    "the active valence orbits for @xmath44 are @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , while for @xmath52 it is still insufficient to include only two or three major shells .",
    "we can see a similar behaviour of occupation probabilities in the wavefunctions of @xmath31dy , which is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-c for proton and [ fig1]-d for neutron orbits . in these figures",
    "two cases of @xmath63 ( superdeformed state ) and 0.25 ( normal prolate state ) are compared .",
    "it is clear that @xmath53 and @xmath64 inert cores are good for normal states , while @xmath65 and @xmath66 cores are suitable for superdeformed states .",
    "thus the inert core of superdeformed states becomes much smaller than that of normal states in both the hg - pb and dy - gd regions .    from the viewpoint of the ibm ,",
    "the number of bosons is determined by half of the number of valence nucleons . because of the small inert core the number of bosons increases significantly for superdeformed states in comparison with that in the usual ibm .",
    "in fact in the case of @xmath28hg , the boson number in the usual ibm is @xmath67 by taking the usual hole picture , and @xmath68 with the particle picture mentioned above . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of bosons for superdeformation becomes @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , in the case of @xmath31dy , @xmath70 while @xmath71 . in general , @xmath72 is about three times larger than @xmath73 .",
    "note that the number of proton bosons and neutron bosons are close in these two cases , and this approximate equality seems to be a general tendency of the superdeformed states .",
    "this result can be naturally understood since equal numbers of valence protons and neutrons maximizes the attractive proton - neutron interaction .",
    "next we consider the effects of pairing correlations on the structure of wave functions of superdeformed states .",
    "the strength parameter @xmath17 of the pairing interaction should be chosen depending on the model space .",
    "since the value of @xmath17 for such a large space is not known empirically , we first describe normal states within the extended valence space , and determine the value of @xmath17 by requiring that the pairing gap @xmath74 takes a reasonable value .",
    "for @xmath28hg the value of @xmath17 has turned out to be 0.06mev which gives @xmath75 mev . using this value",
    ", we investigate the effect of the pairing correlations on the structure of valence wave functions . for this value of @xmath17 ,",
    "the gap for superdeformed states becomes about @xmath76 mev for both proton and neutron orbits .",
    "in contrast to normal deformed states , which are sensitive to changes in values of @xmath17 , the superdeformed states are almost insensitive to @xmath17 values ( the intrinsic quadrupole moment and the occupation probabilities change very little ) .",
    "thus the following discussion about the structure of valence wave function of superdeformation is almost independent of pairing correlations .",
    "we can investigate the relation between the superdeformation and the ibm by analyzing valence wave functions from the viewpoint of collective nucleon pairs .",
    "since the bosons in the ibm are understood as images of these pairs , such an analysis is essential in establishing a microscopic basis for the super ibm .",
    "we consider @xmath28hg as an example .",
    "the nilsson + particle - number - conserving bcs wave function can be expressed as the condensed state of coherent cooper - pairs in the deformed potential @xcite @xmath77 acting on the inert core @xmath78 . in this expression , @xmath79 ( @xmath80 )",
    "denotes the creation operator of a cooper - pair in proton ( neutron ) orbits and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) means half of the valence proton ( neutron ) number .",
    "these @xmath83-pairs can be decomposed into a linear combination of collective nucleon pairs with good angular momenta @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath43 denote the collective nucleon pairs with spin - parity @xmath88 @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath43 and the @xmath92 s are amplitudes .",
    "the probability of each pair in the @xmath83-pair is given by the square of each amplitude , and is listed in table  [ table1 ] for two cases of @xmath44 and @xmath52 .",
    "it is well known that in the case of normal deformation the dominant components are the @xmath93- and @xmath94-pairs @xcite .",
    "in fact , these two components account for 100@xmath54 probability in the case of @xmath44 . in the case of @xmath52 , the total probability of the @xmath93- and @xmath94-pairs",
    "is about 80@xmath54 and we can conclude that these pairs are still dominant in the @xmath83-pair",
    ". however the probability of the @xmath17-pair is now sizable , and it can no longer be neglected in a detailed description of high - spin states . it should be noted that the ratio of the @xmath93-pair to the other pairs is quite similar to that of @xmath95-boson to the other bosons in the su(3 ) limit of the ibm , which are shown in the same table .",
    "this suggests that the su(3 ) limit of the @xmath3-ibm could provide a reasonable phenomenological framework for superdeformed states .    to summarize the microscopic results , we emphasize two important points for the description of superdeformed bands in the ibm :",
    "one is the significant increase in the boson number , and the other is the importance of g - bosons . in addition , it has been found that the bosons for superdeformed states carry the collectivity over many major - shells and that the su(3 ) limit is a reasonable starting point .",
    "a simultaneous description of the spectroscopy of normal and superdeformed states requires rather complicated wave functions , therefore we focus on the latter here and leave the complete picture for future work .",
    "we introduce the superbosons @xmath96 as the boson images of the @xmath97 collective nucleon pairs in the superdeformed well ( bold face notation is used for super bosons to distinguish them from the normal ones ) .",
    "the quadrupole hamiltonian for this system of bosons has the form @xmath98 where the quadrupole operator is defined as @xmath99^{(2 ) } + q_{22 } [ { \\bf d}^\\dagger { \\tilde { \\bf d } } ] ^{(2 ) } + q_{24 } [ { \\bf d}^\\dagger { \\tilde { \\bf g } } + { \\bf g}^\\dagger { \\tilde { \\bf d } } ] ^{(2 ) } + q_{44 } [ { \\bf g}^\\dagger { \\tilde { \\bf g } } ] ^{(2)}. \\label{qsdg}\\ ] ] here brackets denote tensor coupling of the boson operators and @xmath100 . the parameters @xmath101 in eq . ( [ qsdg ] )",
    "determine strengths of boson interactions relative to the @xmath102 coupling .",
    "since the su(3 ) limit is used as a reference point in the rest of the paper , we quote the values for the quadrupole parameters in this limit ; @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 . as stressed in the introduction , numerical diagonalization of this hamiltonian for @xmath106 bosons",
    "is not possible even on a supercomputer .",
    "the large number of bosons are , however , an advantage for the analytic @xmath0 expansion technique which we employ here for solving the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion method has previously been discussed in detail @xcite and the recent extensions to higher orders are given in ref .",
    "therefore , we give only a short account of the formalism here , focusing mainly on the accuracy of the results for high - spin states .",
    "the starting point of the @xmath0 calculations is the boson condensate @xmath107 where @xmath108 are the mean field amplitudes to be determined by variation after projection ( vap ) from the energy expression @xmath109 here @xmath110 denotes the projection operator .",
    "the resulting energy expression is a double expansion in @xmath0 and @xmath111 , and has the generic form @xmath112 where @xmath113 and the expansion coefficients @xmath114 involve various quadratic forms of the mean fields @xmath115 , e.g. , @xmath116 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath114 have recently been derived up to the third order , @xmath117 , using computer algebra @xcite .",
    "another observable of interest in the study of superdeformed states is the @xmath118 transitions . assuming that the quadrupole transition operator is the same as in the hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath119 where @xmath120 is an effective boson charge , the @xmath118 matrix elements are given by @xmath121 \\label{e2}\\ ] ] where @xmath122^{1/2}$ ] and the coefficients @xmath123 are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) gives the familiar rigid - rotor result .",
    "the second term is negative and is responsible for the boson cutoff effect in @xmath118 transitions .    before applying the 1/@xmath29 expansion results , we compare them with those obtained from an exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "diagonalization is carried out for @xmath124 which is the maximum possible boson number for this purpose .",
    "the quadrupole parameters @xmath125 are scaled down from their su(3 ) values with @xmath126 which gives an adequate parametrization for the hg - pb region .",
    "[ fig2]-a compares exact results for the dynamic moment of inertia @xmath127 ( circles ) with three different @xmath0 calculations .",
    "the solid line shows the third order vap results which is seen to follow the exact results very accurately .",
    "the second order vap ( dotted line ) and the third order vbp results ( dashed line ) break down around spin @xmath128 .",
    "hence for description of high - spin states , the third order @xmath0 expansion formulas with vap seem to be both necessary and sufficient . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]-b , the exact @xmath118 transition matrix elements ( circles ) are compared with those obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) ( line ) .",
    "the agreement is again very good up to very high - spins .",
    "note that the accuracy of the @xmath0 expansion results improves with increasing @xmath29 , hence in actual applications with @xmath129 , one would expect an even better agreement .",
    "the test case discussed here indicates that the extended formalism can be applied with confidence in the spin region @xmath130-@xmath131 which covers the presently available data range for superdeformed bands .",
    "in this section , we apply the @xmath0 expansion formulas first in a systematic study of dynamic moment of inertia and @xmath5 values , and then to describe the experimental data on superdeformed bands .",
    "since @xmath14 is a scale parameter for energies , we need to study the effect of the three quadrupole parameters @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the effect of variations in each @xmath101 on dynamic moment of inertia while the other two are held constant at the su(3 ) values . here",
    "@xmath135 denotes the scaling parameter from the su(3 ) values .",

    ", one needs to break the su(3 ) limit . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it is seen that @xmath127 is most sensitive to @xmath133 ( note the different scales in the three figures ) .",
    "the other ( diagonal ) parameters have smaller and opposite effect on @xmath137 .",
    "since the amount of data does not justify use of too many parameters , we prefer to scale all three with the same parameter @xmath135 .",
    "the result of this simultaneous scaling is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]-a which is essentially the same as the one for @xmath133 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . an interesting feature of these results is that the quadrupole hamiltonian has the scope to describe both the increases and decreases in @xmath127 . for @xmath138 ,",
    "the @xmath102 coupling is relatively stronger than the @xmath139 coupling which results in loss of monopole pairing with increasing spin , and hence increase in @xmath137 .",
    "the opposite happens for @xmath140 .",
    "[ fig4]-b shows the effect the simultaneous variations in the quadrupole parameters on the @xmath5 values . the curving down of lines is due to boson cutoff which is most effective for smaller values of @xmath135 .    in the light of the above systematic studies , we have carried out fits to the available data on superdeformed bands in the hg - pb and gd - dy regions .",
    "the boson number is determined from microscopics , and @xmath14 and @xmath135 are fitted to the data .",

    "the dynamic moment of inertia of superdeformed bands in dy isotopes exhibit an entirely different behaviour ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "they are very close to the rigid - rotor values , and hence the su(3 ) limit as reflected in the values of @xmath145 .",

    "a reasonable description is obtained using boson effective charges @xmath147 which are typical values used in the normal ibm calculations .",
    "since the @xmath5 values are sensitive to the boson number ( they vary as @xmath148 ) , this provides a consistency check on the microscopically derived boson numbers .",
    "a further @xmath29 dependence is provided by the boson cutoff term in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) which causes a drop in the calculated @xmath5 values at high - spins .",
    "least - square fits to the data indeed indicate a drop in the @xmath5 values towards the high - spin end .",
    "however , the error bars are too large to reach an unambiguous conclusion whether this effect is genuine or not .",
    "in this paper , we have reviewed a microscopic basis and a practical formulation of the ibm for application to superdeformed nuclei .",
    "the availability of analytical formulas owing to the 1/@xmath29 expansion technique means fast and efficient analysis of data . as first examples",
    ", we have considered the superdeformed bands in the hg - pb and gd - dy regions .",
    "a good description of data is obtained in the hg - pb region confirming the simple quadrupole nature of these superdeformed bands . in the gd - dy region , the dynamic moment of inertia exhibits large variations which can not be accommodated in a simple collective model .",
    "such variations are due to the single particle degree of freedom and require extension of the model for a better description of the data .",
    "finally , the formalism can be used in investigating some other interesting features of superdeformed nuclei such as identical bands and @xmath149 symmetry which will be pursued in future work .",
