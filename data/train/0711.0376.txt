    "another way to see how the parameter @xmath78 ( [ gamma ] ) appears in the model is to make the change of variables in the action ( [ s ] ) as follows : @xmath106 with @xmath82 given by ( [ lh ] ) .",

    "all these methods require numerical methods to involve .",
    "it is possible , however , to roughly estimate the energy density of a vortex , based on the results of the previous subsection [ subs structure ] .",
    "there are three different contributions to the energy density of the vortex , each associated with different terms in the action ( [ s ] ) : the kinetic energy of the scalar , @xmath110 the potential energy , @xmath111 and the kinetic energy of the gauge field , @xmath112 first we note that the energy density inside the scalar core associated with the kinetic term @xmath10 is approximately equal to the potential energy : @xmath113 while the energy density of the gauge field is given by @xmath114 using ( [ eps1 ] ) , ( [ eps2 ] ) and taking into account ( [ lh ] ) , ( [ lvless ] ) and ( [ lvgreater ] ) it is easy to estimate the energy density of the vortex for different forms of the kinetic term @xmath10 : @xmath115 notice that eq .",

    "for @xmath117 the vector core spreads wider than the scalar one , so in the region @xmath118 the kinetic term takes the standard form , therefore we set @xmath73 in ( [ efunc ] ) and arrive at eq .",
    "( [ eest ] ) .    an important consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eest ] ) is that for a particular choice of the non - canonical kinetic term ( namely , @xmath116 ) , the energy per unit length of a vortex can be ( much ) larger than that for the standard vortex .",
    "the opposite is impossible : there is no lagrangian that leads to vortices with small energy per unit length .",
    "one can understand this as follows : although the scalar core can be adjusted to have a small size , ( exactly as in the case of global defects @xcite ) , the vector core nevertheless spreads widely , with the configuration close to the standard case .",

    "let us now discuss constraints on the parameters of the model . in this section we will closely follow the similar consideration for the case of global @xmath0-defects @xcite with necessary adjustments .",

    "( [ eom phi ] ) for high wave - numbers becomes the eom for a global scalar @xmath0-field .",
    "the hyperbolicity condition for perturbations for @xmath0-essence field reads @xcite @xmath121 it is easy to check that for the born - infeld - like kinetic term ( [ bi ] ) the hyperbolicity condition ( [ hyperbolicity ] ) is met for @xmath122 , while for the second example we consider , eq .",
    "( [ x3 ] ) , inequality eq .",
    "( [ hyperbolicity ] ) is always true .",
    "meantime the eom for the gauge field ( [ eom a ] ) in the limit of small wavelengths coincides with the standard eom for the normal electromagnetic field , since the r.h.s of ( [ eom a ] ) can be neglected in this limit .",
    "thus we have proved that the system of equations ( [ eom phi ] ) , ( [ eom a ] ) is hyperbolic provided that the inequality ( [ hyperbolicity ] ) holds , and therefore there are no instabilities for small wavelengths .",

    "a remarkable feature of the model is that the non - linearity of the kinetic term inevitably leads to the appearance of a new scale in the action , a `` kinetic '' mass , in addition to the `` usual '' scalar and vector masses .",
    "the presence of another mass scale in the model changes radically the basic properties of a vortex : the size of the scalar core and the energy of a vortex per unit length vary considerably as compared to the standard case .",
    "we have investigated general properties of @xmath0-vortices and found restrictions on the parameters of the model , having in mind a rather general form of a kinetic term with the asymptotic behavior @xmath139 . also , for the sake of simplicity and clarity of results we assumed that the scalar and vector masses are of the same order , @xmath140 .",
    "we can summarize our general estimations as follows .",
    "the size of the scalar core , @xmath83 , depends on the coupling @xmath8 , and mass scales @xmath7 and @xmath14 , eq .",
    "( [ lh1 ] ) .",
    "a remarkable point is that @xmath83 roughly coincides with the characteristic size of the core in the case of a global @xmath0-vortex @xcite .",
    "the size of the vector core @xmath89 does not depend on the kinetic mass @xmath14 and is roughly the same as in the standard case , eq .",
    "( [ lv1 ] ) .    having the values for",
    "the core sizes one can estimate the energy of @xmath0-vortex per unit length , see eq .",
    "( [ eest ] ) .",
    "an important result is that the mass of a vortex radically vary depending on the choice of kinetic term . in the case @xmath116 and the limit @xmath141 , we have found a simple exact expression for the energy functional of @xmath0-vortex , eqs .",
    "( [ efunc ] ) , ( [ f ] ) .    as particular examples",
    ", we studied numerically two concrete models having non - canonical kinetic terms : a dbi - like term , eq .",
    "( [ bi ] ) , and a power - law term , eq .",
    "( [ x3 ] ) .",
    "the field profiles of domain walls for different choices of @xmath10 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig num ] : the numerical solutions are in agreement with our general estimations .    as we already discussed in our previous work @xcite , interesting properties of @xmath0-defects may have important consequences for cosmological applications .",
    "standard cosmic strings which might have been formed during phase transitions in the early universe have a mass scale directly connected to the temperature of a phase transition @xmath142 , @xmath143 . by contrast",
    ", the mass scale of a resulting @xmath0-string depends both on @xmath142 and the kinetic mass @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the tension of @xmath0-strings may not be close to @xmath144 , thus helping to avoid constrains on cosmic strings @xmath145 @xcite ( or even stronger , @xmath146 , see @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile theoretical predictions give @xmath147 for gut strings .",
    "if , however , physics at the gut scale involves non - standard kinetic terms , then the gut phase transition may have lead to the formation of cosmic strings with smaller tension , @xmath148 , thereby evading conflicts with the present observations .",
