    "the unitarity isobar model @xmath0maid @xcite was developed in 2002 for @xmath0 photo- and electroproduction on nucleons .",
    "the model includes a nonresonant background , which consists of nucleon born terms in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels and the vector meson exchange in the @xmath5 channel , and @xmath3-channel resonance excitations .",
    "the born terms are evaluated with the pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "the vector meson contribution is obtained by the @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson exchange in the @xmath5 channel with pole - like feynman propagators . for each partial wave the resonance contribution is parameterized by the breit - wigner function with energy dependent widths .",
    "the @xmath0maid-2003 version includes 8 resonances , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and was fitted to proton data for differential cross sections and beam asymmetry at photon beam energies up to 1400 mev .",
    "the @xmath0maid-2003 version describes not only the experimental data available in 2002 , but even a bump structure around w=1700 mev in @xmath0 photoproduction on the neutron , which was observed a few years later .",
    "however , this version fails to reproduce the new polarization data obtained in mainz @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to extend the @xmath0maid-2003 version to higher energies , to improve a description of the new polarization data , and to include the @xmath2 photoproduction channel .",
    "the full angular coverage of differential cross sections and polarization observables allow us to perform a fit with a legendre series truncated to a maximum orbital angular momentum @xmath16 :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 are associated legendre polynomials .",
    "the spin - dependent cross sections , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 were obtained by multiplying the corresponding asymmetries with the differential cross sections obtained in mainz .    as an example , the results for the legendre coefficients for differential cross sections are presented in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . a non - zero @xmath22 only posible with @xmath23-wave contribution , @xmath24 is dominated by the an interference between @xmath25 and @xmath23 waves , @xmath26 includes @xmath25 , @xmath23 waves and an interference between @xmath27 and @xmath23 waves , and so on .",
    "the first coefficient , @xmath28 , was omitted in the figures because of it includes all possible partial - wave amplitudes and just only reflects the magnitude of the total cross section , see fig .  3 .",
    "non - zero values of the @xmath29 and @xmath26 coefficients point to a contribution of the @xmath25 wave at energies above w=2 gev for both @xmath0 and @xmath2 channels .",
    "the errors in the determination of the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath22 do not allow any conclusions about the contribution of @xmath23 wave in these reactions .",
    "polarization observables for @xmath0 photoprduction were measured below w=1.9 gev .",
    "the legendre fit for these data shows the sensitivity to small partial - wave contributions and indicates @xmath30 interferences below w=1.6 gev and @xmath31 interferences above w=1.6 gev @xcite .",
    "new @xmath0maid-2015 model is based on the @xmath0maid-2003 version .",
    "the following main changes were made :    * 12 additional resonances were added : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ; * electromagnetic couplings for the vector mesons were updated according to ref .",
    "@xcite ; * hadronic vector and tensor couplings for the vector mesons were fixed from ref .",
    "@xcite ; * data base for the fit was updated .",
    "the new model was fitted to data of differential cross sections from a2mami @xcite and clas collaborations @xcite , polarisation observables t , f @xcite and @xmath44 @xcite , @xcite . the main variable parameters for each resonance : breit - wigner mass , total width , branching ratio to @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) decay , photoexcitation helicity amplitudes @xmath47 and @xmath48 , a relative sign between the @xmath49 and the @xmath50 couplings . besides , the hadronic pseudoscalar coupling for the born term contribution , cutoffs for dipole formfactors of the vector mesons , damping factors for the partial widths and the electromagnetic form factor of the resonances were also fitted . branching ratios for hadronic decays of the resonances besides the investigated channel",
    "were fixed .    as an initial parameter set for the breit - wigner parameters",
    "the last bnga solution @xcite was used . as initial parameter limits uncertainties from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite were used .",
    "as the first step , for each resonance @xmath47 and @xmath48 are fixed because of a strong correlation with the branching ratio . on the second step",
    "the branching ratios obtained on the first step are fixed , but @xmath47 and @xmath48 are variable , and so on . after few iterations",
    "the initial limits are changed if necessary .",
    "the fits for the @xmath0 and @xmath2 channels were done independently .",
    "the fit results for the total cross sections and the polarization observables are presented in figs .",
    "3 - 6 together with corresponding experimental data .",
    "we used the differential cross section from the clas collabration  @xcite in this fit because of their much smaller statistical errors , larger energy covering , and better agreement with the high statistic data from a2mami  @xcite in an overlapping energy region .",
    "unfortunately , the total cross section was not determined in ref .",

    ", there is a very interesting feature at energy @xmath511900 mev , which could be explained by a cusp due to the opening of a new channel , @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "the main resonance , which is responsible for this effect is the @xmath35 .",

    "other resonance contributions are much smaller then the background .",
    "the new @xmath0maid-2015 solution describes shape of the graal data for @xmath44 near threshold , but not the magnitude ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . to explain , why the magnitude of the asymmetry is larger at lower energy , it is probably necessary to include below threshold resonances using the more realistic approach applied in ref .",
    "@xcite for the roper resonance at @xmath0-meson photoproduction .",
    "in summary , we have presented new version @xmath0maid-2015 .",
    "the model describes available data for the @xmath60 and @xmath58 reactions reasonably well .",
    "the cusp at w@xmath511900 mev in @xmath60 reaction was explained as a threshold effect from the @xmath2 channel .",
    "parameters of @xmath35 resonance , responsible for this effect , were determined .",
    "a further improvement could be achieved by adding below threshold resonances and using regge trajectories for the vector mesons in @xmath5 channel . furthermore , polarization observables which should come soon from a2mami , cbelsa / taps , and clas collaborations will help to improve the model .",
