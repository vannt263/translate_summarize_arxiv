    "psr  j1012@xmath05307  is a 5.3ms pulsar in a binary system with orbital period of 14.5h and a low mass companion @xcite .",
    "it was discovered during a survey for short period pulsars with the 76 m lovell radio telescope at jodrell bank .",
    "@xcite reported optical observations revealing an optical counterpart within @xmath5arcsec of the pulsar timing position being consistent with a helium white dwarf ( wd ) companion .",
    "the optical observations of the wd companion provide unique information about the evolution of the binary system and the radio pulsar itself , such as comparing the cooling age of the companion with the spin - down age of the pulsar @xcite .    using the ne2001 model for the galactic distribution of free electrons @xcite and the pulsar s dispersion measure ( dm ) of @xmath6@xmath7 pc @xcite a distance of @xmath8pc",
    "is derived .",
    "in contrast , @xcite compared the measured optical luminosity of the wd to the value expected from wd models and calculated a distance of @xmath9pc . in addition they measured , by the doppler shift of the measured h spectrum of the companion , a radial velocity component of @xmath10kms@xmath11 relative to the ssb . from the radial velocity and the orbital parameters of the system the mass ratio of the pulsar and",
    "its companion was measured to be @xmath12 . finally by fitting the spectrum of the wd to a grid of da ( hydrogen dominated ) model atmospheres they derived a companion mass of @xmath13 , a pulsar mass of @xmath14 and an orbital inclination angle of @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite presented the most complete precision timing analysis of psr  j1012@xmath05307  using 4 years of timing data from the effelsberg 100 m radio telescope and 7 years from the 76 m lovell telescope .",
    "using their low eccentricity binary model ell1 and combining the timing measurements with the results from the optical observations they derived the full 3d velocity information for the system .",
    "furthermore , after correcting for doppler effects , they derived the intrinsic spin parameters of the pulsar and a characteristic age of @xmath16gyr which is consistent with the wd age from the optical estimates .",
    "in addition , after calculating upper limits for an extremely low orbital eccentricity they discussed evolutionary scenarios for the binary system but also presented tests and limits of alternative theories of gravitation . finally , they discussed the prospects of future measurements of post - keplerian parameters ( pk ) which can contribute to the description of the orientation of the system and the calculation of stringent limits for the effective coupling strength of the scalar field to the pulsar .",
    "in this paper we revisit psr  j1012@xmath05307  with seven more years of high - precision timing data and combined datasets from the european pulsar timing array ( epta ) telescopes consisting of the 100 m effelsberg radio - telescope of the max - planck - institute for radioastronomy , germany , the 76 m lovell radio - telescope at jodrell bank observatory of the university of manchester , uk , the 94 m equivalent westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) , the netherlands and the 94 m equivalent nanay decimetric radio telescope ( nrt ) , france . after a short description of the timing procedure and the technique of combining our multi - telescope data , we present the updated measurements of the astrometric , spin and binary parameters for the system .",
    "specifically we show the improvement in all the timing parameters and in the orbital eccentricity limit and in addition the value for the first time for psr  j1012@xmath05307  of the timing parallax .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a value for the orbital period variation , in agreement with the prediction of @xcite , from which we test different theories of gravitation and give one of the tightest bounds on a parametrised post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameter .",
    "finally , we present how the timing measurement of the change of the projected semi - major axis can complete the picture of the orientation of the binary system .",
    "psr  j1012@xmath05307  was observed regularly with the effelsberg 100 m radio telescope since october 1996 with typical observing times of 515min in three consecutive scans .",
    "monthly observations were performed at 1400mhz using the primary focus cooled hemt receiver .",
    "it has a typical system temperature of 25k and an antenna gain of 1.5kjy@xmath11 . in order to monitor dispersion measure ( dm ) variations ,",
    "it was also observed irregularly until august 2006 and monthly thereafter , at 2700mhz . at these frequencies a cooled hemt receiver located at the secondary focus",
    "was used which has a system temperature of 25k .",
    "finally , it was occasionally observed at 860mhz using an uncooled hemt receiver , located at the primary focus , with a typical system temperature of 60k . the effelsberg - berkeley pulsar processor ( ebpp )",
    "was used for coherent on - line de - dispersion of the signal from the lhc and rhc polarisations .",
    "it has 32 channels for both polarisations spread across bandwidths of 40 , 100 and 80mhz at 860 , 1400 and 2700mhz respectively @xcite .",
    "the output signals of each channel were fed into de - disperser boards for coherent on - line de - dispersion and were synchronously folded with the topocentric period .",
    "each toa was obtained by cross - correlation of the profile with a synthetic template , which was constructed out of 12 gaussian components fitted to a high signal - to - noise ratio standard profile @xcite .",
    "the toas were locally time stamped using a h - maser clock at the observatory .",
    "they were converted to utc using the gps maser offset values measured at the observatory , and the gps to utc corrections were made from the bureau international des poids et measures ( bipm ) .",
    "psr  j1012@xmath05307  has been observed with the lovell radio telescope 23 times per month since 1993 , at three different frequencies .",
    "it is continuously observed at 1400mhz and at 410 and 606mhz , it was observed until 1997 and 1999 , respectively .",
    "all the receivers are cryogenically cooled with system temperatures of 25 , 50 and 35 , respectively and their lhc and rhc polarisation signals are detected and incoherently de - dispersed in a 2@xmath1732@xmath170.0312mhz filter bank at 410mhz , in a 2@xmath176@xmath170.1250mhz filter - bank at 606mhz and in a 2@xmath1732@xmath171mhz filter - bank at 1400mhz .",
    "the signals are synchronously folded at the topocentric pulsar period and finally copied to a disc .",
    "each toa was obtained by cross - correlation of the profile with a standard template , generated by the summation of high s / n profiles .",
    "the toas were transferred to gps from a h - maser and the time stamp was derived as for effelsberg .",
    "psr  j1012@xmath05307  was observed monthly using the wsrt with the puma - i pulsar machine @xcite .",
    "we used three observing frequencies : observations at centre frequencies of 1380mhz and 350mhz were carried out monthly from august 1999 , and the pulsar was observed occasionally at a centre frequency of 840mhz from 2000 until 2002 .",
    "the system temperatures were 27 , 120 and 75k , respectively and most observations were 30 minutes long .",
    "the wsrt observations used a bandwidth of 8@xmath1810mhz for observations at 840mhz and 1380mhz , and after september 2006 the 8 bands were spread out over a total observing bandwidth of 160mhz for the 1380mhz observations . the observations at the low frequency setup used only two bands of 10mhz , either centred at 328 and 382mhz or 323 and 367mhz .",
    "for the observations taken at 1380 or 840mhz we used 64 frequency channels per 10mhz band , and the observations at the low frequencies used 256 frequency channels per 10mhz band .    for each observation ,",
    "the data were de - dispersed and folded offline .",
    "integration over frequency and time resulted in one single profile for each observation .",
    "each profile was cross - correlated with a standard template , generated by the summation of high s / n profiles , so finally only one toa was computed for each observation .",
    "the toas were transferred to gps from a h - maser clock and the time stamp was derived as for effelsberg .",
    "psr  j1012@xmath05307  was observed roughly every 3 to 4 weeks with the nanay radio telescope ( nrt ) since late 2004 .",
    "the nanay radio telescope is equivalent to a 94-m dish , with a gain of 1.4kjy@xmath11 and a minimal system temperature of 35k at 1.4ghz in the direction of the pulsar . with the bon ( berkeley - orleans - nanay ) coherent dedispersor , in the period covered by the observations , a 64mhz band centred on 1398 mhz is split into sixteen 4mhz channels and coherently dedispersed using a pc - cluster , with typical integration times of one hour .",
    "the nanay data are recorded on a utc(gps ) time scale marked at the analogue to digital converter by a thunderbolt receiver ( trimble inc . ) .",
    "differences between utc and utc(gps ) are less than 10ns and therefore no laboratory clock corrections are needed .",
    "a single toa was calculated from a cross - correlation with a pulse template for each observation of one hour .",
    "combing the epta multi - telescope datasets is not a trivial process .",
    "the main technique for achieving the optimal combination of the data sets is presented by @xcite . in general , using different datasets from different telescopes and obtained at different frequencies requires extra corrections , apart from the usual one of the transformation of all the individual telescope arrival times to arrival times in the tai at the solar system barycentre ( ssb ) .",
    "the extra corrections needed are usually constant time offsets between different datasets of residuals .",
    "these offsets derive from differences in the procedure of calculating the toas at each telescope , specifically differences in the templates .",
    "the timing software package tempo can fit for these time offsets or `` jumps '' . in the current work seven of these jumps",
    "need to be fitted corresponding not only to the telescopes but also to the different frequencies used .",
    "normally , three `` jumps '' , one for each telescope , would be sufficient .",
    "however , the toas at different frequencies are usually calculated by different templates , which might not be aligned optimally . in the current case",
    ", this occurs for effelsberg and westerbork toas . in table",

    "the need for continuous multi - frequency toas for precise measurement of the dispersion measure ( dm ) and monitoring of the dm variations was successfully accomplished .",
    "most important the combination of the high quality data from effelsberg , nanay , wsrt with the long time span data of jodrell ( & effelsberg ) provides us with a 15 year dataset of toas with no significant time gaps . using all these epta datasets we improve and measure all the astrometric , spin and binary parameters of psr  j1012@xmath05307  presented in the first column of table [ tab : par ] . as a comparison , in the second column the measured parameters of only the current effelsberg set is shown and in the third the effelsberg measurements from @xcite . from table [ tab : par ] it is clear that the epta provides the most accurate error estimations and in addition @xmath20 measurements of 2 post - keplerian parameters .    [",

    "all the combined toas , weighted by their individual uncertainties , were analysed with tempo , using the de405 ephemeris of the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) @xcite and the ell1 @xcite binary model .",
    "tempo minimises the sum of the weighted squared timing residuals , producing a set of improved pulsar parameters and the post - fit timing residuals .",
    "the uncertainties on the toas from each telescope are scaled by an appropriate factor to achieve a uniform reduced @xmath21 for each data set .",
    "the best post - fit timing solution of all the combined residuals is presented in figure [ fig : postfit ] . in the top panel the post - fit versus time is shown , with arbitrary offsets of the different datasets , where it is clear that the uncertainties of most of the data points are comparable . by comparing the parameters we get by different combinations of data sets ( i.e. only the 1400mhz data or without jodrell ) we concluded that it is much more efficient to finally use all the available datasets together , as shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig : postfit ] .",
    "apart from the common method of dm distance estimation ( @xmath22pc ) and the more rare optical one ( @xmath23pc ) for psr  j1012@xmath05307 , there is another way of measuring the distance to a pulsar , with pulsar timing . in general",
    ", the timing residuals of nearby pulsars demonstrate an annual parallax .",
    "this timing parallax is obtained by measuring a time delay of the toas caused by the curvature of the emitted wavefronts at different positions of the earth in its orbit .",
    "this time delay has an amplitude of @xmath24 @xcite , where @xmath25 is the earth - sun distance , @xmath26 the ecliptic latitude of the pulsar , @xmath27 the speed of light and @xmath28 the distance to the pulsar .",
    "this effect has been measured for very few pulsars like psr b1855 + 09 @xcite , psr j1713 + 0747 @xcite , psr j0437@xmath294715 @xcite , psr j1744@xmath291134 @xcite , psr j2145@xmath290750 @xcite and psr j0030 + 0451 @xcite .",
    "here for the first time we measure a parallax @xmath30mas for psr  j1012@xmath05307 .",
    "this parallax corresponds to a distance of @xmath31pc which is consistent with the @xmath32 pc measured from the optical observations .",
    "the difference with the dm distance may point to a sparse free electron distribution in this location of the galaxy @xcite . by combining the optical and timing parallax distance measurements we calculate the weighted mean @xcite of the distance getting an improved value of @xmath33pc .      combining the proper motion measured from timing ( table [ tab : par ] ) and the distance to the system and the radial velocity of @xmath34 km@xmath11s from the optical observations of the wd",
    ", @xcite managed to determine the full 3d motion of the pulsar relative to the ssb .",
    "our new timing results improve the proper motion measurements by an order of magnitude and using the combined parallax and optical distance we recalculate the 3d motion of the pulsar .",
    "we derive transverse velocities of @xmath35 and @xmath36 this yields a total transverse velocity of @xmath37kms@xmath11 . using the radial velocity from the optical measurements we get the space velocity of the system @xmath38kms@xmath11 , consistent and almost three times more precise than the previous value .",
    "in addition , this value is still consistent with the average space velocity of millisecond pulsars of @xmath39kms@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "since we know the 3d velocity of psr  j1012@xmath05307  we can try , for the first time , to track its galactic path in time and space . assuming a characteristic age of @xmath40gyr and applying a model for the galactic potential @xcite , we derive the evolutionary path of psr  j1012@xmath05307  in the galaxy from the point it started emitting as a millisecond pulsar . in the top part of figure",
    "[ fig : xyz ] , the projection of the evolutionary path of the pulsar on the galactic plane is shown , where the arrow indicates the current position of the pulsar and the star indicates the position of the sun , for the @xcite model ( the @xcite derives similar results ) .",
    "it is obvious that the pulsar is presently at one of its closest approaches to the sun , which is why we can actually observe it .",
    "psr  j1012@xmath05307reaches maximum distances of @xmath41kpc through its path , spending only a small fraction of its lifetime close to the solar system orbit . in figure",
    "[ fig : xyz ] ( bottom ) the movement of psr  j1012@xmath05307  above and below the galactic plane is shown versus time indicating that the pulsar is oscillating with a period of @xmath42gyr reaching a maximum distance of @xmath43kpc above and below the galactic plane .",
    "psr  j1012@xmath05307  is a low eccentricity binary system . in our current timing solution",
    "we measure a value for the eccentricity of @xmath44 .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the shapiro delay can not be separated from the roemer delay for this system , which leads to a small correction to this eccentricity value and specifically to the first laplace - lagrange parameter @xmath45 .",
    "thus , following their convention , for a companion mass of @xmath46 , a mass ratio @xmath47 and a mass function of @xmath48 we derive the range @xmath49 and shape @xmath50 of the shapiro delay according to @xmath51 and @xmath52^{1/3}.\\ ] ] the intrinsic value of @xmath53 , calculated from equation ( a22 ) of @xcite , due to the contribution of the shapiro delay , is @xmath54 .",
    "the true eccentricity of the system is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 . by solving this equation in a monte carlo simulation ( figure [ fig : mcecc ] ) , for datasets of the values and uncertainties of the intrinsic @xmath53 and @xmath57",
    ", we obtain an upper limit for the intrinsic eccentricity : @xmath58 @xmath59 this limit is better than the previously published value @xcite .",
    "this improved limit has another significant importance . using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem",
    ", @xcite predicted that the orbital eccentricity , of a pulsar - wd binary system is correlated with the orbital period .",
    "specifically , there is the theoretical prediction of a relic orbital eccentricity due to convective eddy currents in the mass accretion process of the neutron star from the companion while in the red giant phase . in @xcite the eccentricity limit of psr  j1012@xmath05307was plotted versus the orbital period and",
    "was compared with the model curves of the @xcite model .",
    "our current eccentricity limit is much lower than the one in @xcite , but still in good agreement with the predictions from this model .",
    "a change in the projected semi - major axis has been measured in the current analysis , for the first time , for psr 1012 + 5307 .",
    "the observed value of @xmath60 can be the result of the various effects @xcite : @xmath61    the first term , @xmath62 , is the doppler correction , which is the combined effect of the proper motion of the system @xcite and a correction term for the galactic acceleration .",
    "the contribution for the galactic acceleration , @xmath63 , is of order @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the contribution of the shklovskii effect to be @xmath65 .",
    "both the contributions are very small compared to the observed value , thus , this term can be neglected .",
    "the second term , @xmath66 is arising from the shrinking of the orbit due to gravitational - wave damping @xmath67 @xcite , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is expressed in units of solar masses .",
    "@xmath70 is the projected semi - major axis and @xmath71 the orbital period .",
    "this contribution again is much smaller than the current measurement precision .",
    "the third term , @xmath72 , is the contribution of the varying aberration caused by geodetic precession of the pulsar spin axis , and is typically of order @xmath73 @xcite . for a recycled pulsar , like psr  j1012@xmath05307",
    ", the spin is expected to be close to parallel to the orbital angular momentum , which further suppresses this effect .",
    "hence , the contribution is at least three orders of magnitude smaller than the observed .",
    "the fourth term , @xmath74 , is representing a change in the size of the orbit caused by mass loss from the binary system .",
    "we investigate the mass loss due to the loss of rotation energy by the pulsar , which we consider as the dominant mass - loss effect .",
    "we initially calculate the change in the orbital period from the same contribution as follows : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and the moment of inertia of the pulsar @xmath77 g@xmath78 . subsequently , by kepler s third law we calculate the change in the projected semi - major axis of the orbit to be @xmath79 .",
    "thus , we can also neglect this contribution .",
    "the fifth and the sixth terms , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , are the contributions due to the classical spin - orbit coupling caused by a spin - induced quadrupole moment of the companion and the existence of an additional planetary companion respectively . they can both be neglected . for the first one to be significant , a main - sequence star or a rapidly rotating white dwarf companion @xcite would be necessary .",
    "the second is not being considered because there is no evidence for another companion to the pulsar .",
    "since all the other contributions are much smaller than the observed variation of the projected semi - major axis , we conclude that the measured value is arising from the last term of equation ( [ eq : dota1 ] ) , @xmath82 .",
    "this is a variation of @xmath70 caused by a change of the orbital inclination while the binary system is moving relatively to the ssb @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the effect is presented in the following equation : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the position angle of the ascending node .",
    "the quantities @xmath70 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are expressed in seconds and milliarcseconds per year , respectively .",
    "the proper motions and the inclination angle have been measured and since we measure the value of @xmath87 , we can , for the first time , restrict the orbital orientation @xmath84 of psr  j1012@xmath05307 . in figure",
    "[ fig : xdotomega ] the @xmath82 versus the position angle of the ascending node is presented .",
    "unfortunately , our measured value can not fully restrict the orientation , however from the lower limits of @xmath88 we derive significant limits for the position angle .",
    "for an inclination angle of @xmath89 we get @xmath90 and @xmath91 while for @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94      there are several effects that can contribute to changes in the observed orbital period of a binary system that can be either intrinsic to the orbit or just kinematic effects .",
    "the most important terms are : @xmath95 @xmath96 , measured here for the first time @xmath97 , is the observable rate of change of the orbital period .",
    "the first and second terms , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , are the contributions from the mass loss from the binary and from tidal torques respectively .",
    "they can both be neglected in the case of psr  j1012@xmath05307  because the first one is very small , as shown before @xmath100 , and the second is also small due to the lack of interaction between the pulsar and the companion .",
    "the third term , @xmath101 , is identical to the first term of equation ( [ eq : dota1 ] ) . in order to account for the galactic acceleration",
    "we have extended the @xcite expression ( for a flat rotation curve ) to high galactic latitudes @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath104 is the vertical component of galactic acceleration taken from @xcite , which for galactic heights @xmath105 kpc can be approximated with sufficient accuracy by @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath108 @xcite and @xmath109kms@xmath11kpc@xmath11 @xcite are the sun s galactocentric distance and galactic angular velocity (= oort s @xmath110 ) . for the pulsar s galactic coordinates of @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    "we find @xmath113    we also calculate the contribution due to the shklovskii effect according to the following : @xmath114 where we used the measured proper motion and the weighted mean of the distance discussed earlier , @xmath28 .",
    "so , by summing we yield the doppler correction : @xmath115    the fourth term , @xmath116 , is the contribution due to gravitational wave emission . in general relativity , for circular orbits",
    "it is given by @xmath117 for psr  j1012@xmath05307  we find @xmath118 .",
    "all the previous terms are the ones that are expected to contribute by using gr as our theory of gravity .",
    "however , most alternative theories of gravity predict an extra contribution to the observed orbital period variation , via dipole radiation ( see @xcite and references therein ) . this dipolar gravitational radiation results from the difference in gravitational binding energy of the two bodies of a binary system , and is expected to be much larger than the quadrupolar contribution , especially if the binding energies of the two bodies of the binary system differ significantly .",
    "thus , the case of psr  j1012@xmath05307 , where there is a pulsar - wd system , is ideal for testing the strength of such emission .",
    "one finds for small - eccentricity systems @xmath119 where @xmath69 is expressed in units of solar masses .",
    "@xmath120 refers to the dipole self - gravitational contribution , which takes different values for different theories of gravity ( zero for gr ) and @xmath121 is the difference in the `` sensitivities '' of the two bodies ( see @xcite for definition ) , and @xmath122 is the reduced mass , @xmath123 , of the system .",
    "the sensitivity of a body is related to its gravitational self - energy @xmath124 . in the post - newtonian limit @xmath125 , which gives @xmath126 for a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "hence , we can neglect @xmath127 in equation ( [ eq : dipole1 ] ) since @xmath128 . using the mass ratio @xmath129 , equation ( [ eq : dipole1 ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath130 for a specific theory of gravity @xmath131 is known and @xmath132 can be calculated as a function of the equation - of - state of neutron star - matter .    finally , there are theories that predict that the locally measured gravitational constant @xmath133 changes with time as the universe expands",
    ". a changing gravitational constant would cause a change in the orbital period , which for neutron star - wd systems can be written as @xmath134 p_{b } \\:\\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic change of the orbital period is the observed value minus the doppler correction term from equation ( [ eq : doppler ] ) : @xmath135 which agrees well with the gr prediction given above as @xmath136 hence , there is no need for a @xmath137 or @xmath138 to explain the observed variation of the orbital period . on the other hand , this can be used to set limits for a wide class of alternative theories of gravity , which we will show in the following sections .      a tight system comprising a strongly self - gravitating neutron star and a weakly self - gravitating white dwarf should be a very efficient emitter of gravitational dipole radiation , if there is any deviation from general relativity that leads to a non - vanishing @xmath131 in equation ( [ eq : dipole1 ] ) .",
    "hence , observations of such systems are ideal to constrain deviations of that kind .",
    "psr  j1012@xmath05307  turns out to be a particularly useful system to conduct such a test , since : ( 1 ) the white - dwarf nature of the companion is affirmed optically , ( 2 ) the mass estimates in this double - line system are free of any explicit strong - field effects , which are a priori unknown , if we do not want to restrict our analysis to specific theories of gravity , ( 3 ) the estimated mass of the pulsar seems to be rather high , which is important in the case of strong field effects that occur only above a certain critical mass , like the spontaneous scalarisation @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the change in the orbital period is in full agreement with the prediction by general relativity , once the kinematic contributions are accounted for . hence , any deviations from general relativity leading to a different @xmath139 is either small or compensated for a potential @xmath140 .",
    "however , we can already limit the variation of the gravitational constant by using the published limit of @xmath141yr@xmath11 from the lunar laser ranging ( llr ) @xcite . in combination with equation ( [ eq : g ] ) it gives @xmath142 , for the most conservative assumption @xmath143 .",
    "hence , @xmath144 , which with the help of equation ( [ eq : dipole2 ] ) converts into @xmath145 furthermore , if we assume @xmath146 ( c.f .",

    "this value improves slightly on the previously published limit of @xmath151 @xcite , obtained from psr  j0751 + 1807",
    ". if the non - linear coupling parameter @xmath152 is of order 10 or larger , then neutron stars are much more weakly coupled to the scalar field than white dwarfs @xcite . in this case , for psr  j1012@xmath05307 , @xmath153 , which is an order of magnitude weaker than the limit @xmath154 from psr  j1141@xmath296545 @xcite .",
    "actually , in tensor - scalar theories of gravity the latter is possibly the most constraining pulsar binary system .",
    "however , since there has been no optical identification of the companion , that could establish its wd nature without mass determination based on a specific gravity theory , it is not yet possible to derive a general theory independent limit for dipole radiation from psr  j1141@xmath296545 , as done here with psr  j1012@xmath05307 .    in the future , more accurate determination of the distance and improvement of our @xmath155 value , could further increase the precision of the psr  j1012@xmath05307  limit .      in the previous section",
    "we have used the llr limit for @xmath156 in order to provide a test for dipole radiation with a single binary pulsar system . on the other hand ,",
    "a generic test for @xmath156 can not be done with a single binary pulsar , since in general theories that predict a variation of the gravitational constant typically also predict the existence of dipole radiation @xcite . for binary pulsars with white - dwarf companions that have orbital periods @xmath15710 days . ] from equations ( [ eq : dipole1 ] ) and ( [ eq : g ] ) we can see that @xmath158 whereas @xmath159 . hence , one can combine any two binary pulsars , with tight limits for @xmath160 and different orbital periods , in a joint analysis to break this degeneracy , and to provide a test for @xmath156 and the dipole radiation that is based purely on pulsar data . a formally consistent way of doing this with white - dwarf binary pulsars is the application of equation @xmath161      - 4 \\pi^2 \\frac{t_\\odot\\mu}{p_b^2 } \\",

    "this procedure properly accounts for the correlations due to this mutual dependence , and thus provides a self consistent test for @xmath156 and the dipole radiation , that does not rely on llr limits or theory specific assumptions .",
    "there remains the problem of getting a good estimate for @xmath132 in a general theory independent test .",
    "as before , we will use @xmath164 keeping in mind that the limits given below are subject to certain changes , if a different assumption for @xmath132 is made .    with its short orbital period and",
    "its fairly well determined masses psr  j1012@xmath05307  is an ideal candidate for such a combined analysis .",
    "presently , the best binary pulsar limit for @xmath156 comes from psr  j0437@xmath294715 @xcite , where @xmath165 has been used in the analysis to obtain the limit for @xmath156 .",
    "using this pulsar in combination with psr  j1012@xmath05307  in a joint analysis as introduced above gives , with a 95 per cent c.l .",
    ", @xmath166 and @xmath167 where @xmath168kms@xmath11mpc@xmath11 has been used as a value for the hubble constant @xcite .",
    "our pulsar test therefore restricts @xmath169 to less than a 20th of the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "the limit for @xmath156 given here is clearly weaker than the one given in @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this is that the equation for @xmath140 used by @xcite does not account for the sensitivity of the pulsar as in equation ( [ eq : g ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the combined analysis still allows for a certain range for @xmath170 in psr  j0437@xmath294715 , leading to a somewhat weaker limit compared with an analysis that uses @xmath171 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : montekg ] .",
    "although this limit for @xmath156 is weaker than the llr limit , it still provides a useful independent addition to the llr result , as has been argued in @xcite .",
    "the limit for the dipole radiation is slightly weaker than the one given in the previous section .",
    "however , in contrast to the limit of the previous section , the limit here does not rely on the llr result for @xmath156 , and therefore constitutes an independent test based solely on binary pulsar observations .",
    "we would like to stress two facts about the advantage of combining specifically these two binary pulsars .",
    "firstly , in both cases the companion white dwarf is identified optically , and its non - compact nature is ascertained independently of the underlying theory of gravity . secondly , the two pulsars seem to be rather heavy and similar in mass ( @xmath172)4715 does not allow the determination of the pulsar mass , since this requires the mass function , which contains explicit strong - field contributions . within the generic class of conservative gravity theories ( @xcite ) , for instance , only the effective gravitational mass , @xmath173 , of psr  j0437@xmath294715 can be determined .",
    "however , if one assumes that @xmath174 deviates less than 20 per cent from @xmath133 , the pulsar mass is in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 solar masses . ] ,",
    "which is important in case we have effects like spontaneous scalarisation above a critical neutron star mass @xcite . in the future",
    ", more accurate measurements of @xmath175 and distance of the two pulsars could constrain even more our derived limits .",
    "we have presented results from the high precision timing analysis of 15yr of epta data for psr  j1012@xmath05307 . a first ever measurement of the timing parallax @xmath1 and distance has been obtained for this pulsar .",
    "combined with information from optical observations of the wd companion an improved 3d velocity has been derived for the system .",
    "this information enables the derivation of the complete evolutionary path of the pulsar in the galaxy , showing that it spent most of its lifetime far away from the solar system orbit .",
    "in addition , an improved limit on the extremely low intrinsic eccentricity , @xmath176 ( 95 per cent c.l . ) , has been acquired , which agrees well with the theoretical eccentricity - orbital period relation @xcite .    of particular interest",
    "is the measurement of the variation of the projected semi - major axis , @xmath177 which is caused by a change in the orbital inclination as the system moves relative to the ssb .",
    "this measurement allowed us to set limits on the positional angle of the ascending node , for the first time , the last unknown parameter in fully describing the orientation of this binary system .",
    "as a result of the significant measurement of the change in the orbital period of the system , @xmath178 , and the identified nature of the two bodies in this binary system , tests for alternative gravity theories could be performed .",
    "firstly , a stringent , generic limit for the dipole radiation has been obtained from psr  j1012@xmath05307 , @xmath179 ( 95 per cent c.l . ) , with the use of the @xmath4 limit from llr . secondly , in a self",
    "consistent analysis we have used psr  j1012@xmath05307  together with psr j0437@xmath294715 to derive a combined limit on the dipole radiation and the variation of the gravitational constant , @xmath180 and @xmath181 ( 95 per cent c.l . )",
    "these limits have been derived just with the use of millisecond pulsar - wd binaries and are valid for a wide class of alternative theories of gravity .",
