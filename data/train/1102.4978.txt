    "spin polarized devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions have been recognized as potential building blocks for a new type of spin based electronics in recent years .",
    "while magnetic tunnel junctions , which are composed of two ferromagnetic electrodes sandwiching an insulating barrier , were first conceived in 1975 by julliere,@xcite it was not until the 1990s that significant junction magnetoresistance ( jmr ) was demonstrated in magnetic tunnel junctions at room temperature@xcite and it was realized that transport through these structures is extremely sensitive to the interface scattering and spin polarized interface density of states of the electrode.@xcite briefly , in magnetic tunnel junctions it is the relative orientation of the electrode magnetization that determines whether the junction exhibits a high or low resistance state with the jmr being defined as the fractional change of resistance between these two states .",
    "it was not until recently , however , that the importance of understanding the role of the barrier layer in the tunneling process was recognized in experimental and theoretical studies of magnetic tunnel junctions with mgo barriers.@xcite in these junctions , the symmetries of the propagating states in the electrodes and the evanescent states in the barrier , interface resonance states as well as the details of the chemical bonding between the atoms in the electrodes and barrier were recognized to be important factors in describing the spin transport .    another important class of spin polarized devices is a spin filter device in which one electrode and the barrier layer are ferromagnetic ; the relative orientation of the magnetization in the two layers again determines whether the device is in a high or low resistance state . in such devices ,",
    "the ferromagnetic barrier layer has spin filtering functionality and has often been simply described as a finite potential barrier whose height depends on the spin polarization of the carrier .",
    "however it is clear that interaction between the carriers and the barrier make spin transport more complicated . in any case",
    ", effective spin filtering can occur when the two ferromagnetic layers are magnetically decoupled so that one can obtain a significant difference in resistance between the parallel low resistance state and the anti - parallel high resistance state .",
    "this magnetic decoupling had , up until recently , only been realized in polycrystalline spin filter junctions with and without a nonmagnetic layer separating the two ferromagnetic layers.@xcite    recently , however , spin - filtering behavior has been observed in epitaxial oxide junctions.@xcite although some of these studies are based on junctions with a nonmagnetic spacer layer between the ferromagnetic spin filter barrier layer and the ferromagnetic electrode , others demonstrated that spin - filtering behavior can be obtained without this nonmagnetic spacer .",
    "for example , we have studied junctions composed of one cubic perovskite structure la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) electrode , a spinel structure barrier layer and spinel structure electrode .",
    "@xcite the weak magnetic decoupling occurs at the interface of the ferromagnetic perovskite electrode and ferrimagnetic spinel barrier layer due to magnetic frustration . in these junctions ,",
    "a ferrimagnetic fe@xmath5o@xmath6 electrode was used as it was strongly coupled to the barrier layer and its magnetization provided a handle with which to magnetically switch the barrier layer . to date , it is unclear how there could be little or no magnetic coupling between adjacent ferromagnetic epitaxial layers . in order to understand the weak magnetic coupling , a detailed study of the magnetism at this interface and the role of magnetic anisotropy and magnetic frustration in determining",
    "the spin filtering behavior is necessary .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that two adjacent ferromagnetic layers of a spin filter junction can be weakly magnetically coupled . the magnetic coupling at this interface , and hence the magnetotransport in the spin filter junctions , is largely determined by the magnetic anisotropy at the interface .",
    "we have fabricated lsmo/ chromite/ fe@xmath5o@xmath6 junctions where the chromite barrier layer , either cocr@xmath7o@xmath6 ( cco ) or mncr@xmath7o@xmath6 ( mco ) , is isostructural with fe@xmath5o@xmath6 .",
    "although both chromite compounds form a normal spinel with all cr@xmath8 ions in the octahedral sites , the magnetic anisotropy of the two compounds are opposite in sign and thus give rise to junction magnetoresistance values over an order of magnitude higher in cco junctions compared to mco junctions .",
    "detailed studies of chemical and magnetic structure at the interfaces in both types of junctions indicate that abrupt changes in magnetic anisotropy across the non - isostructural interface is the cause of the significant suppression of jmr in mco junctions .",
    "the angular dependence of the junction magnetoresistance highlights the consequences of changes in interface anisotropy .",
    "therefore magnetic anisotropy provides a means by which we can control magnetic coupling and tune junction behavior .",
    "both lsmo and fe@xmath5o@xmath6 have been shown to be highly spin polarized and therefore are good candidates for magnetic tunnel junctions.@xcite the lattice of lsmo can be described in terms of a pseudocubic unit cell with 3.87@xmath9 on a side while fe@xmath5o@xmath6 forms a cubic spinel with 8.396@xmath9 on a side .",
    "the spinel barrier layer has been chosen to be cco or mco which have curie temperatures of 95k or 45k , respectively .",
    "cco and mco have lattice parameters of 8.333@xmath9 and 8.437@xmath9 respectively and are well matched to the fe@xmath5o@xmath6 .",
    "the trilayers of lsmo / cco / fe@xmath5o@xmath6 and lsmo / mco / fe@xmath5o@xmath6 were synthesized by pulsed laser deposition on ( 110 ) oriented srtio@xmath5 ( sto ) substrates supplied by crystec gmbh .",
    "commercial sintered powder targets of stoichiometric single - phase oxides were used for ablation at an energy density of 1 - 1.5 j/@xmath10 .",
    "deposition parameters for the layers are as follows : lsmo in 320 mtorr of o@xmath7 at 700 @xmath11c ; fe@xmath5o@xmath6 in a vacuum of better than 4x10@xmath12 torr at 450 @xmath11c ; mncr@xmath7o@xmath6 and cocr@xmath7o@xmath6 in 25 mtorr of o@xmath7 at 600 @xmath11c .",
    "thicknesses of the lsmo and fe@xmath5o@xmath6 electrodes were approximately 30 - 50 nm while the chromite barriers were 2 - 4 nm thick . following thin film growth , one half of twin samples were characterized for coercive fields and morphology while the other half were fabricated into junctions between 4x4 @xmath13m@xmath14 and 40x40 @xmath13m@xmath14 in area .",
    "the junctions were fabricated by conventional photolithography and ar ion milling .",
    "in addition , bilayer samples of ( 110)sto / lsmo / chromite and ( 110)sto / chromite / fe@xmath5o@xmath6 were synthesized in order to probe the non - isostructural and isostructural interfaces respectively using element specific x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) spectroscopy .",
    "the surface sensitive nature of these probes required us to make these bilayers with a top layer thickness of less than 5 nm to ensure that we were able to probe the two types of interfaces .",
    "the structure of our films was characterized by x - ray diffraction on a philips analytical xpert mrd diffractometer and by cross sectional transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) using the philips cm300 microscope at the national center for electron microscopy in lawrence berkeley national laboratory .",

    "xas and xmcd experiments in total electron yield ( tey ) mode were performed at beamlines 4.0.2 and 6.3.1 of the advanced light source ( als ) at lawrence berkeley national laboratory .",
    "spectroscopy experiments were performed with the sample surface normal 60@xmath11 inclined from the x - ray beam from 15 k - 300 k in fields of up to 0.8 t.",
    "structural characterization in the form of four circle x - ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were performed .",

    "good registry between perovskite and chromite film layers can be obtained with little disorder at the non - isostructural interface .",
    "a combination of high temperature and highly energetic species during growth make it difficult to avoid interdiffusion of chemical species .",
    "we have demonstrated in a previous study that nanoscale cation migration does occur at isostructural interfaces and that it induces room temperature ferromagnetism in the chromite.@xcite in order to correlate the structure with magnetism , we have used xas and xmcd to probe the chemical and magnetic structure in an element specific manner at both interfaces .",
    "an understanding of the magnetism in the lsmo , fe@xmath5o@xmath6 and chromite layers as well as at their interfaces is crucial in determining the dominant mechanism in the transport of junctions composed of these materials . through a combination of bulk film magnetometry and surface - sensitive xmcd ,",
    "we have developed a complete picture of the magnetism in these junction trilayers .",
    "bulk magnetization measurements of the trilayers reveal a magnetically easy axis along the in - plane @xmath15 $ ] direction and a hard axis perpendicular in the @xmath16 $ ] direction as shown in figure [ fig1 ] for both types of junctions . despite small differences in the plots ,",
    "we observe distinct parallel and anti - parallel electrode magnetization states along the @xmath15 $ ] direction .",
    "we note that for cco films on ( 110 ) sto substrates , we observe uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with a [ 001 ] easy axis and a hard @xmath16 $ ] axis @xcite .",
    "however for mco films on [ 110 ] sto substrates , the sign of the magnetic anisotropy is reversed with the easy axis now being along the @xmath16 $ ] axis and the hard axis along the [ 001 ] axis .",
    "both lsmo and fe@xmath5o@xmath6 films on ( 110)sto show uniaxial anisotropy with an easy [ 001 ] axis .",
    "when the lsmo , fe@xmath5o@xmath6 and chromite layers are incorporated into a trilayer , the [ 001 ] direction remains the easy direction . because the magnetic signal from the chromite barrier layer is so small , we can not clearly probe the chromite magnetism in the heterostructures via squid magnetometry . in order to study the magnetism of the chromite layer and at its two interfaces , we used xmcd to probe the two bilayer samples described above .",

    "one may expect that the ferrimagnetic chromite layers strongly exchange couple to the fe@xmath5o@xmath6 , but it is less clear as to the nature of the coupling above the chromite t@xmath17 . room temperature element - specific hysteresis loops at the fe l@xmath5 edge along the @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] directions are shown in the solid lines of figure [ fig2 ]",

    "previously , it was found that the growth of a spinel structure material on top of a cubic rocksalt or perovskite with half the unit cell can give rise to anti - phase boundaries and misfit dislocations.@xcite these defects , along with the ferromagnetic lsmo and ferrimagnetic chromite lattices , give rise to magnetic frustration . in order to probe the magnetism of such an interface in more detail ,",
    "the ( 110 ) lsmo / chromite bilayers were explored in an analogous manner to the fe@xmath5o@xmath6/chromite bilayers .",

    "the corresponding xas lineshapes show features characteristic of tetrahedral mn@xmath20 in the mco top layer , thus indicating that mn@xmath20 does not contribute magnetic signal above the mco t@xmath17 . below the mco t@xmath17 ,",
    "the mn xmcd lineshape becomes dominated by the magnetism in the mco layer .    from the mn l@xmath18 lineshapes , it is clear that xmcd probes mn in both the lsmo and mco layers .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] ( b ) indicates that the ( 110 ) lsmo retains its uniaxial anisotropy with the magnetically hard direction along the in - plane @xmath16 $ ] direction .",

    ". a quick look at the plot indicates that there are three temperature regimes : t=0 - 70 k , t=70 - 175 k , and t=175 - 300 k. in the lowest temperature region , the jmr decreases with decreasing temperature in contrast to the expected increase of lsmo spin polarization with decreasing temperature . in this temperature regime ,",
    "the fe@xmath5o@xmath6 electrode resistance is large and increases with decreasing temperature due to the verwey metal - insulator transition ; thus the jmr is dominated by the fe@xmath5o@xmath6 resistance .    in the intermediate temperature region ,",
    "the bias dependence of the jmr is asymmetric and the jmr increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] illustrates this asymmetry quite clearly for junctions with 4 nm cco and mco barriers . in this temperature region ,",
    "the spin polarization of the electrodes is large at low temperatures , but the asymmetric structure of the barrier / electrode interfaces produces an asymmetric conduction barrier .",
    "there have been numerous studies of magnetic tunnel junctions where asymmetries in the jmr bias dependence have been attributed to the two different interface density of states at the two electrode - barrier interfaces.@xcite in our case , it is not surprising that the isostructural and non - isostructural interfaces give rise to distinctly different density of states .",
    "we also observe a zero bias anomaly whose origin we attribute to the opening up of a charge gap in the fe@xmath5o@xmath6 below the verwey transition .",
    "the jmr minimum at 50 - 100 mv is consistent with observed charge gaps in fe@xmath5o@xmath6.@xcite    in the highest temperature region , the magnitude of jmr is negligible and has little bias dependence",
    ". one might wonder why the spin polarization seems to decrease so much above 175 k if the fe@xmath5o@xmath6 t@xmath17 is 858k and the lsmo t@xmath17 is 360 k .",
    "our previous study on the temperature dependence of the magnetic coupling at the fe@xmath5o@xmath6/cco interface indicates that the magnetization of the fe , cr and co sublattices decrease substantially between t=150 - 200k.@xcite thus it is expected that the spin - filtering efficiency for the exchange - coupled chromite - fe@xmath5o@xmath6 bilayer also decreases substantially in this temperature region .",
    "additionally , temperature - dependent measurements of magnetic junctions with lsmo electrodes and nonmagnetic barrier layers have shown that the interface spin polarization is suppressed almost as much as the suppression of lsmo surface spin polarization.@xcite suppression of spin polarization at both interfaces leads to a vanishingly small jmr at room temperature .",
