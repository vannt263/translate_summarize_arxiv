    "the interaction of the conduction electrons in a solid with the lattice vibrations is described by the so - called electron - phonon problem . migdal@xcite and eliashberg@xcite pioneered the study of such interacting fermion - boson systems in the limit where the phonons are all harmonic , and the phonon energy scale is much smaller than the electronic energy scale .",
    "vertex corrections can be neglected in this case@xcite and a self - consistent theory can be constructed that is exact in the limit of weak - coupling ; the theory is an expansion in powers of the coupling strength multiplied by the ratio of the phonon energy scale to the electronic energy scale .",
    "but phonons in real materials are never purely harmonic  higher - order ( anharmonic ) contributions to the phonon potential are always present .",
    "this phonon anharmonicity is responsible for many different physical effects in solids .",
    "for example , thermal expansion arises purely from anharmonic effects  a harmonic crystal does not change its volume upon heating .",
    "such anharmonic effects have been treated in an approximate fashion : in the quasiharmonic approximation@xcite only the effect of thermal expansion is taken into account by postulating that the phonon frequencies have a dependence upon the volume of the crystal , as described by the gr \" uneisen parameter ; in the self - consistent harmonic approximation@xcite the harmonic force constants are self - consistently replaced by their thermal averages over all possible motions of the other atoms  it is used to describe systems with strong anharmonicity ; finally , in the pseudoharmonic approximation@xcite both thermal expansion effects and phonon - phonon interactions are taken into account by employing the quasiharmonic approximation plus a perturbative expansion in the phonon - phonon interaction .",
    "superconducting transition temperatures have also been studied , with the result that anharmonicity does not enhance the transition temperature in the weak to moderate coupling regime where eliashberg theory applies@xcite .",
    "but an exact treatment of lattice anharmonicity is difficult from a theoretical point of view because an anharmonic `` perturbation '' is never a small perturbation ; the phonon wavefunctions are always dominated by the anharmonic terms in the potential as the phonon coordinate becomes large .",
    "even the qualitative effects of lattice anharmonicity on superconductivity are not well understood .",
    "all that is known rigorously about the anharmonic electron - phonon problem is that the ground state must contain a spin singlet@xcite for even numbers of electrons on a finite lattice .",
    "much progress can be made however , in the limit of strong coupling ( the electron - phonon interaction is much larger than the hopping integral of the electrons ) , where the electrons strongly bind together into preformed pairs ( called bipolarons ) and the ground state of the system is highly degenerate .",
    "degenerate perturbation theory ( in the kinetic energy of the electrons ) about this bipolaronic ground state produces an expansion in inverse powers of the coupling strength .",
    "this theory has been exhaustively analyzed to second order in the hopping@xcite and has recently been studied to fourth order in the hopping@xcite . in this contribution , the fourth - order calculations are extended to include both anharmonic phonons and a direct electron - electron repulsion .    the simplest electron - phonon model that includes both anharmonic effects and direct electron - electron repulsion is the anharmonic holstein - hubbard model@xcite in which the conduction electrons interact with themselves and with local phonon modes : @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron at site @xmath3 with spin @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the electron number operator , and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the phonon coordinate ( momentum ) at site @xmath3 .",
    "the hopping of electrons between lattice sites @xmath3 and @xmath8 is governed by the hopping matrix element @xmath9 ( @xmath9 is a hermitian matrix ) .",
    "the local phonon has a mass @xmath10 and a frequency @xmath11 associated with it ; the combination @xmath12 is a spring constant that measures the stored energy per unit length squared in the phonon coordinate .",
    "the anharmonic contribution to the phonon potential energy is chosen to be a quartic in the phonon coordinate with a strength @xmath13 .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction strength is parameterized by an energy per unit length and is denoted @xmath14",
    ". a useful combination of fundamental parameters is the bipolaron binding energy ( in the harmonic limit with @xmath15 ) @xmath16 which determines the energy scale for the effective electron - electron interaction mediated by the phonons .",
    "this attraction competes with the direct coulomb repulsion denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "the chemical potential is @xmath18 .    the hopping matrix elements @xmath9 are used to define the energy scale .",
    "the choice @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the dimensionality of the lattice , is made so as to have a well - defined limit when @xmath22 .",
    "the mass is then set equal to one @xmath23 leaving @xmath24 , @xmath17 , @xmath13 , and @xmath11 as free parameters .",
    "the strong - coupling expansion is a perturbative expansion in the hopping terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) and is valid when the bipolaron binding energy is much larger than the electronic hopping integral .",
    "another important parameter in the strong - coupling limit is the polaron band - narrowing parameter denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the original holstein hamiltonian corresponds to the case @xmath26 .",
    "both the harmonic holstein model and the harmonic holstein - hubbard model have been solved exactly in the limit of infinite dimensions via quantum monte carlo simulation@xcite .",
    "these models display charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order near half filling and superconductivity ( sc ) away from half - filling . as the phonon frequency is increased , the sc is favored relative to the cdw order .",
    "however , in the strong - coupling limit , cdw order is favored over sc because of the band - narrowing effect of the bipolaron .",
    "the quantum monte carlo simulations also found that the effective phonon potential ( determined after integrating out the effects of the electrons ) generically acquires a double - well structure signifying the formation of a bipolaron , and indicating that a strong - coupling expansion should be accurate even down to moderate values of the coupling strength .",
    "this has proven to be true for the harmonic case@xcite and is likely to also hold over a more restricted region for the anharmonic case .",
    "an initial analysis of the anharmonic model in the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath27 ) can be made by using the born - oppenheimer approximation@xcite : the phonon frequency is assumed to be smaller than any of the other energy scales so the phonons can be approximated by static lattice distortions corresponding to the minimum of the phonon potential energy .",
    "since the phonons couple linearly to the electronic charge , the equilibrium phonon coordinate varies when there are zero , one , or two electrons on a site .",
    "the origin @xmath28 is chosen to correspond to the case with no electrons on a site . then @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the equilibrium coordinates with one or two electrons on a lattice site . in the harmonic case the relative distances",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are identical , which is a requirement for particle - hole symmetry .",
    "when a lattice anharmonicity is turned on , the equilibrium phonon coordinates with one and two electrons on a lattice site all move toward the origin , but the relative distances are no longer symmetric , rather the distance @xmath32 becomes significantly smaller than @xmath31 , as can be seen by calculating the perturbative shift in the equilibrium coordinates@xcite as a function of the anharmonicity @xmath13 @xmath33    this asymmetric shift of the equilibrium phonon coordinate as a function of lattice anharmonicity causes two main effects : ( 1 ) the model loses particle - hole symmetry which allows a new type of superconductivity to emerge @xcite and ( 2 ) the effective electron - electron attraction is sharply reduced as can be seen by a plot of the bipolaron binding energy in figure 2  ( b ) .",
    "thus the lattice anharmonicity generates an effective _ retarded _ repulsive interaction between the electrons and breaks particle - hole symmetry , removing the nesting instability of the cdw at half filling and weak coupling .",
    "one expects that the lattice anharmonicity thereby to favor sc relative to cdw order , although it is also likely that anharmonic effects will reduce the transition temperatures ( except close to the filled band , where the new hole - superconductivity mechanism can take over ) .",
    "what is surprising is that a rather small lattice anharmonicity can have a large effect on the electron - phonon problem .",
    "since the main effects of lattice anharmonicities are driven by the asymmetric distribution of the equilibrium phonon coordinate when there is zero , one , or two electrons on a lattice site , one expects that anharmonic effects will be strongest in the small - phonon - frequency limit .",
    "this is because the phonon coordinates all approach zero in the high - frequency limit ( because the phonon reacts instantaneously to the change in the electrons ) and these asymmetric effects disappear .",
    "since phonon frequencies tend to be small in real materials , anharmonic effects can be important even if the phonon potential energy appears to be well approximated by a harmonic potential , i.  e. , if @xmath13 is small .",
    "hirsch s new mechanism for superconductivity arises from an examination of the anharmonic electron - phonon model in the static limit@xcite .",
    "the tunneling matrix element for a polaron from one lattice site to its nearest neighbor depends exponentially on the difference @xmath31 if there is no electron on the neighboring site and exponentially on @xmath32 if there is an electron occupying the neighboring site .",
    "the exponential dependence arises from the franck - condon overlap factors .",
    "since these two values can be significantly different in an anharmonic model , one finds that the electronic motion will be dominated by a kinetic energy that depends on the density of the electrons at a given site .",
    "this is precisely the physical situation needed to generate superconductivity from kinetic energy effects ",
    "paired electrons have a lower effective mass than a single electron , which induces the superconductivity transition at a low enough temperature .",
    "this novel mechanism for generating superconductivity has been analyzed via weak - coupling mean - field theory analyses@xcite but has not yet been shown to exist in the exact solution of any model system .",
    "this new mechanism for superconductivity disappears , however , in the strong - coupling limit where restriction is made to consider only empty sites and bipolarons .",
    "the single - electron ( polaronic ) states are integrated out because the bipolaron binding energy is much larger than the electronic hopping integral .",
    "electron - hole symmetry is restored since these polaronic states only appear in virtual processes .",
    "the anharmonicity has a much different effect than a direct electron - electron repulsion .",
    "the electron - electron repulsion uniformly reduces the bipolaron binding energy without changing the equilibrium phonon coordinates when there are zero , one , or two electrons at a lattice site .",
    "thus , ( 1 ) the bipolaron binding energy can become negative ( signifying there is no electron - electron pairing ) and ( 2 ) the system explicitly retains it s electron - hole symmetry .",
    "furthermore , since the repulsion is instantaneous , the retardation effects are unchanged from the case without coulomb repulsion , i.  e. , the franck - condon overlaps remain the same .",
    "thus we expect cdw ordering to always survive at half filling ( if there is a net electron - electron attraction ) , and that both sc and cdw order will disappear as the coulomb repulsion becomes too large , but it is not clear whether or not they disappear together , or at different values of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "this contribution is a continuation of the work of one of the authors@xcite on the strong - coupling expansion for the harmonic holstein model to include both anharmonic and coulomb repulsion effects . in sec .",
    "ii , the formalism for the perturbation theory , and the generation of the effective pseudospin hamiltonian will be described . in sec .",
    "iii , a mean - field - theory analysis of the pseudospin hamiltonian will be given , and appropriate phase diagrams calculated for both the anharmonic case and the coulomb repulsion case . conclusions and",
    "a discussion will follow in sec . iv .",
    "the strong - coupling expansions are carried out with a method based on perturbation theory .",
    "the ground state is a bipolaronic state consisting of either paired electrons or empty sites .",
    "the distribution of these bipolarons is not determined to zeroth order in the electronic kinetic energy , so the ground state is highly degenerate .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( within this degenerate subspace ) can be determined by using operator methods . in the late 1950 s ,",
    "anderson@xcite first used such methods to show that the strong - interaction - strength limit of the hubbard model is described by a heisenberg antiferromagnet with an exchange integral @xmath34 that vanishes as the interaction strength increases .",
    "kato@xcite described how to determine the effective hamiltonian for an arbitrary degenerate subspace using perturbation theory and operator methods .",
    "his analysis was applied to the hubbard model in one dimension by klein and seitz@xcite and in arbitrary dimensions by takahashi@xcite ( see also the recent work by van dongen@xcite ) .",
    "beni , pincus , and kanamori@xcite and hirsch and fradkin@xcite applied the same methods to the harmonic holstein model determining the effective hamiltonian to second order in the hopping .",
    "this analysis was extended to fourth order by freericks@xcite .",

    "it is apparent that even though the second - order approximation shows large enhancements to the transition temperature as the anharmonicity is increased , the fourth - order approximation indicates that the maximal cdw transition temperature actually decreases as the anharmonicity increases .",
    "furthermore , the value of coupling strength where the maximum occurs increases as a function of anharmonicity .",
    "this is to be expected since the anharmonicity acts in some respects like a retarded coulomb repulsion .",
    "what is surprising is that relatively small values of anharmonicity have such large effects on the transition temperature .    in figure  3(b ) , the cdw transition temperature at half filling is plotted for four different values of @xmath141 .",
    "the same values of @xmath13 are used as in figure  3(a ) .",
    "note that once again the maximal @xmath52 decreases as @xmath13 increases ( implying that @xmath17 increases ) .",
    "furthermore , the peak does not move as rapidly to larger values of the coupling strength , indicating that the retardation effects are rather strong even at the relatively large phonon frequency of @xmath109 .",
    "note that these strong - coupling phase diagrams , may be more accurate than those of the harmonic model , because it is known that in the case of either an anharmonic interaction , or a coulomb repulsion , that the cdw instability only occurs when the coupling strength @xmath24 is large enough in magnitude .",
    "hence the true @xmath52 does vanish at a finite value of @xmath24 , as it does in the fourth - order approximation .",
    "our analysis at half filling ignored the possibility of sc order .",
    "in fact , the system will go superconducting at half filling in the regime where the cdw transition temperature has been suppressed to zero , but since this regime corresponds to a region where the fourth - order approximations are breaking down , we have not complicated figure  3 by including the superconducting solutions at small @xmath142 . rather , we examine what happens as the system is doped away from half - filling . in figure  4 , the phase diagram is plotted for the coupling strength @xmath143 which lies at the peak of the cdw transition temperature curve when @xmath144 .",
    "this case represents a lower limit of applicability of the strong - coupling expansion . in figure  4(a ) , the anharmonicity varies from @xmath145 0 , 0.003 , 0.005 , 0.01 .",
    "the solid lines denote cdw solutions , and the dotted lines are sc .",
    "note that the cdw - sc phase boundary lies at exponentially small densities in the harmonic case . as the anharmonicity is turned on , the cdw transition temperature is suppressed , and the sc transition temperature",
    "is enhanced , so the cdw - sc phase boundary moves in towards half filling .",
    "when @xmath139 , the cdw phase has disappeared .",
    "the enhancement of the sc transition temperature continues as @xmath13 increases , until it is significantly larger than the maximal cdw transition temperature of the harmonic holstein model .",
    "hence , the strong - coupling approximation , through fourth order , predicts a large enhancement in the sc transition temperature relative to the harmonic case .",
    "it is not clear whether this result is an artifact of the approximation , or is a real effect .",
    "note further that the electron density where the maximal superconducting @xmath52 occurs is near the band edges .",
    "this is similar in spirit to hirsch s mechanism , but , as far as we can tell is unrelated , because in the strong - coupling limit the effect occurs both at the top and the bottom of the band , since the approximation explicitly retains electron - hole symmetry .    in figure  4(b ) , the same phase diagrams are plotted , this time using @xmath146 with the same values of @xmath13 as in figure  4(a ) .",
    "clearly one can see that the effect of the coulomb repulsion is quite different from the anharmonicity .",
    "the phase diagram does not change much , and the large enhancement of @xmath52 in the sc channel does not occur .    in order to check to see whether these results are generic , or occur simply because one is close to the limiting region where the approximations are expected to hold , we have also calculated the phase diagrams for a stronger value of the interaction strength @xmath147 . in figure  5(a ) , four different values of @xmath13 ( 0.0 , 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.05 ) are plotted . here",
    "the results are similar to those found in figure  4 , except the anharmonicity initially causes the cdw @xmath52 to rise , because of the reduction in the bipolaron binding energy .",
    "the sc transition temperature still has a large maximum at low densities , and is significantly enhanced relative to the harmonic case .",
    "furthermore , the cdw - sc phase boundary continues to move toward half - filling until it disappears at @xmath148 . in figure  5(b ) , we plot the same phase diagrams , this time using @xmath149 ) .",
    "once again , the phase diagram displays very different behavior , with the cdw - sc phase transition remaining at exponentially small densities .",
    "finally , we study how the critical electron density , where the cdw - sc phase boundary lies , evolves as functions of @xmath24 and @xmath13 . in the anharmonic holstein model ,",
    "we see in figure  6(a ) that the phase boundary moves very rapidly as the anharmonicity is turned on .",
    "this indicates how the anharmonicity strongly favors sc solutions relative to cdw order .",
    "in figure  6(b ) , we show the analogous plots of the critical electron density for the harmonic holstein - hubbard model , with @xmath17 chosen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ucalpha ] ) , and the same values of @xmath13 . clearly the anharmonic behavior is not easily mimicked by an instantaneous coulomb repulsion , and the retardation effects can not be neglected .",
    "the strong - coupling expansion for the anharmonic holstein - hubbard model has been presented through fourth order in the hopping .",
    "this result extends the analysis of the harmonic case@xcite .",
    "we find some interesting results from this analysis .",
    "first , the anharmonicity reduces the bipolaron binding energy and second , it reduces the the equilibrium phonon - coordinate spacing between one electron at a site and either zero or two electrons at a site . the first effect is expected to cause an enhancement to transition temperatures in the strong - coupling regime , and the second should enhance the franck - condon overlap factors for superconducting order , favoring the sc phase relative to the cdw .",
    "similarly , a coulomb repulsion will reduce the bipolaron binding energy , but does not alter the franck - condon overlaps .",
    "we find that in the cdw phase , the maximal transition temperature actually decreases when either anharmonicity or coulomb repulsion are turned on .",
    "for the superconducting phase , the enhancement of the franck - condon overlap factors ( equivalent to a widening of the polaron band ) causes a large enhancement of the sc transition temperature at low electron density , even for moderate values of the anharmonicity . in no case",
    "do we find that the effect of the anharmonicity is easily mimicked by an effective coulomb repulsion .    since the strong - coupling expansion is expected to fail in both the low - electron - concentration regime , and when the effective bipolaron binding energy is no longer much larger than the hopping integral , it is possible that this large enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature is just an artifact of the current approximation .",
    "it is important to compare these approximations to exact quantum monte carlo simulations of the transition temperatures of the anharmonic holstein model .",
