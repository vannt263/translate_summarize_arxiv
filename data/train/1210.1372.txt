    "the theory of quantum electronic transport in nano - scale devices has evolved rapidly over the past decade , as advances in experimental techniques have made it possible to measure transport properties down to single - molecule devices .",
    "the development of accurate theoretical methods for the description of quantum transport at the single - molecule level is essential for continued progress in a number of areas including molecular electronics , spintronics , and thermoelectrics @xcite .",
    "one of the longstanding problems in quantum charge transport is the establishment of a theoretical framework which allows for quantitatively accurate predictions of conductance from first principles .",
    "the need for methods going beyond the conventional approaches , based on equilibrium electronic structure calculations combined with landauer - like elastic scattering , has been clear for a number of years .",
    "only recently have more advanced methods to treat electronic interaction appeared ( for example see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "alternative frameworks to deal with the steady - state or time - dependent transport are given by many - body perturbation theory , based on the non - equilibrium ( ne ) green s function ( gf ) formalism : in these approaches , the interactions and ( initial ) correlations are taken into account by using conserving approximations for the many - body self - energy @xcite .",
    "other interactions , such as electron - phonon coupling , also play an important role in single - molecule quantum transport .",
    "these interactions are more important in nanoscale systems , as the electronic probability density is concentrated in a small region of space and thus normal screening mechanisms are ineffective .",
    "such interactions are also crucial in inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "such a technique constitutes an important basis for spectroscopy of molecular junctions , yielding insight into the vibrational modes ( single molecule phonons called vibrons ) and ultimately the atomic structure of the junction @xcite .",
    "there have been many theoretical investigations focusing on the effect of electron - vibron coupling in molecular- and atomic - scale wires [ 16 - 51 ] . in all these studies ,",
    "the interactions have always been considered to be present in the central region ( i.e. the molecule ) only , with the latter connected to two non - interacting terminals .",
    "interactions are also assumed not to cross at the contracts between the central region and the leads .",
    "when electronic interactions are present throughout the system , as within density - functional theory calculations , they are treated only at the mean - field level and do not allow for any inelastic scattering events",
    ". however , such approximations are valid only in a very limited number of practical cases .",
    "the interactions , in principle , exist throughout the entire system .    in a recent paper we derived a general expression for the current in nano - scale junctions with interaction present everywhere in the system @xcite .",
    "the importance of such extended interactions in nano - scale devices has also been addressed , for electron - electron interaction , in recently developed approaches such as refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we apply our formalism @xcite to a specific model of single - molecule nanojunctions .",
    "we focus on a model system in the presence of electron - vibron interaction both within the molecule _ and _ between the molecule and one of the leads .",
    "we adopt a quasiparticle - like approach to treat the crossing interactions ( i.e. there are some restrictions on the components of the self - energy for the crossing interaction ) .",
    "we show how the interaction crossing at one interface of the molecular nanojunctions affects the transport properties by renormalising the coupling at the interface in a dynamical and bias - dependent manner .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : transport ] , we briefly recall the main result of our expression for the current in fully interacting systems . in sec . [",
    "sec : interac ] , we present the model hamiltonian for the system which includes two kinds of electron - vibron interaction : a holstein - like hamiltonian combined with a su - schrieffer - heeger - like hamiltonian . in this section , we also describe how the corresponding self - energies are calculated and the implications of such approximations on the current expression at the left and right interfaces . in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , we show how the non - equilibrium dynamical renormalisation affects the generalised embedding potential of the left ( @xmath0 ) lead , and how in turn this affects the conductance of the nanojunction .",
    "we finally conclude and discuss extensions of the present work in sec .",
    "[ sec : ccl ] .",
    "we consider a two - terminal device , made of three regions left - central - right , labelled @xmath1 , in the steady - state regime . in such a device",
    "the interaction  which we specifically leave undefined ( e.g. electron - electron or electron - phonon)is assumed to be well described in terms of the single - particle self - energy @xmath2 and spreads throughout the entire system .",

    "they are annotated @xmath6 ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) for the elements in the central region @xmath9 ( left @xmath0 , right @xmath10 region respectively ) , and @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) for the elements between region @xmath9 and region @xmath0 or @xmath10 .",
    "there are no direct interactions between the two electrodes , i.e. @xmath15 .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , we showed that for a finite applied bias @xmath16 the steady - state current @xmath17 flowing through the left @xmath18 interface is given by : @xmath19 \\\\ + & { \\rm tr}_{\\{l\\}}\\left[\\sigma^{{{\\rm mb}},>}_l g^<_l - \\sigma^{{{\\rm mb}},<}_l g^>_l \\right ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the @xmath20 quantities are @xmath21 by definition @xmath22 ( similarly for the @xmath23 components ) where @xmath24 are the nominal coupling matrix elements between the @xmath0 and @xmath9 regions .",

    "is provided in refs .",
    "moreover , we consider that some electron - vibron interaction exists also at one contact ( the left @xmath0 electrode for instance ) .",
    "this model typically corresponds to an experiment for a molecule chemisorbed onto a surface ( the left electrode ) with a tunneling barrier to the right @xmath10 lead .    in the following model",
    ", we consider two kinds of electron - vibron coupling : a local coupling in the sense of a holstein - like coupling of the electron charge density with a internal degree of freedom of vibration inside the central region , and an off - diagonal coupling in the sense of a su - schrieffer - heeger - like coupling @xcite to another vibration mode involving the hopping of an electron between the central @xmath9 region and the @xmath0 electrode .",

    "@xmath44 corresponds to the coupling of an electron with the vibron mode @xmath46 ( with coupling strength @xmath47 ) , and @xmath45 corresponds to the coupling of a hopping electron with another vibron mode @xmath48 ( with coupling strength @xmath49).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the hamiltonian for the region @xmath9 is @xmath50 where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron in the molecular level @xmath53 . the electron charge density in the molecular level is coupled to the vibration mode of energy @xmath46 via the coupling constant @xmath47 , and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) creates ( annihilates ) a vibration quantum in the vibron mode @xmath46 .",

    "the latter represents either the displacement of the centre - of - mass of the molecule or of some chemical group at the end of the molecule link to the @xmath0 electrode . at the lowest order",
    ", the matrix element can be linearised as @xmath64 .",
    "hence the hopping of an electron from the @xmath9 region to the @xmath0 region ( and _ vice versa _ ) is coupled to a vibration mode ( of energy @xmath48 ) via the coupling constant @xmath49 ( itself related to @xmath65 ) .",

    ", we consider different approximations to the treat the interaction inside the central region and the interaction crossing at the left contact .",
    "first of all , calculating exactly the corresponding interaction self - energies is a tremendous task since , in principle , they depend on both the phonon progator and the electron green s functions in all the different parts of the system .",
    "hence , for the first application of our formalism , we proceed step by step in terms of the increasing complexity of the interaction ; and we limit ourselves to approximations for the self - energies that are well known and well controlled .",
    "the electron - vibron self - energies  in the central region @xmath9 are calculated within the self - consistent born approximation ( i.e. diagrams with one phonon line ) .",
    "the details of these calculations have been reported elsewhere @xcite . for the crossing interaction",
    ", we consider a mean - field - like approach for the electron - vibron coupling at the @xmath18 interface .",
    "within such an approximation , we can understand the results of the calculations in terms of renormalisation of the @xmath18 contact .    furthermore considering the crossing interaction occuring only at one interface permit us to check and test the consistency of our formalism .",
    "indeed , with no interaction crossing at the right @xmath79 interface , the current @xmath80 is given by the conventional meir and wingreen formula , i.e. eq .",
    "( [ eq : il_meirwingreen_bis ] ) for the @xmath79 interface . in order to have a consistent formalism , we need to have current conservation , and such a constraint",
    "is best tested with crossing interaction at only one interface .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in detail in [ sec : iconserv ] .    within mean - field - like approximations , the effects of the crossing interaction correspond to a renormalisation of the coupling in a static or a dynamical manner .",

    "this ne renormalisation will induce , among other effects , a bias - dependent modification of the broadening of the spectral features of the @xmath9 region .",
    "we have analysed these effects in details in ref.@xcite .",
    "the renormalisation is such that the amplitude of the current is reduced in comparison with the current values obtained when the interaction is present only in the central region .",
    "the ne static renormalisation of the contact is highly non - linear and non - monotonic in function of the applied bias , and the larger effects occur at applied biases corresponding to resonance peaks in the dynamical conductance .",
    "the conductance is also affected by the ne renormalisation of the contact , showing asymmetric broadening around the resonance peaks and some slight displacement of the peaks at large bias in function of the coupling strengh @xmath49 .    beyond the static limit",
    ", we can develop a dynamical mean - field - like approach for the electron - vibron coupling following ref .",
    "the retarded self - energy containing all orders of the electron - vibron coupling is expressed as a continued fraction as shown analytically in refs .",
    "we have already used such an approach to study the transport properties of organic molecular wires which are dominated by the propagation of polarons @xcite or solitons @xcite .",
    "the expression for the corresponding self - energy @xmath95 is given by : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the retarded component of the off - diagonal gf between the central region and the left lead @xmath0 .",

    "finally , note that for the lowest - order expansion , the self - energy @xmath105 takes a simple form : @xmath106",

    "the values chosen for the parameters are typical values for realistic molecular junctions @xcite . in the following the current",
    "is given in units of charge per time , the conductance in units of the quantum of conductance @xmath111 and the bias @xmath16 and the embedding potential @xmath112 in natural units of energy where @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "one of the most important physical conditions that our formalism needs to fulfil is the constraint of current conservation .",
    "we use conserving approximations to calculate the interaction self - energies in the central region @xmath9 and an quasi - particle approximation for crossing interaction at the left interface .    with our choice for @xmath95 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ser_contfrac ] ) , we find that the left lead generalised embedding potential @xmath115 is renormalised by the crossing interaction .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure [ fig : imyleft ] , which shows the imaginary part of @xmath116 for different transport regimes , different coupling at the @xmath18 interface and for both equilibrium and non - equilibrium conditions .    at equilibrium , and in the absence of contact renormalisation , the imaginary part of @xmath116 is simply the imaginary part of the conventional @xmath0 lead self - energy @xmath117 and corresponds to a semi - elliptic functions with non - zero values within the energy range @xmath118 ( see dashed lines in figure [ fig : imyleft ] ) .",
    "the spectral weight of @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 .",
    "in the presence of the renormalised @xmath0 contact , we obtained a strong deviation from the semi - elliptic function as shown by the ( red ) thin lines and ( black ) thick lines in figure [ fig : imyleft ] , which correspond respectively to the equilibrium ( bias @xmath121 ) and the non - equilibrium ( bias @xmath122 ) conditions .",
    "this result indicates a strong reduction of the available transport channels in the renormalised @xmath0 lead embedding potential for regions of energy where @xmath123 has non - zero value .",
    "however , a very important property is that the total spectral weight of @xmath119 is conserved for all the calculations we have performed , i.e. for all the different transport regimes , coupling strength @xmath49 and @xmath48 at the @xmath18 interface and all applied bias .",
    "we find that in all the cases @xmath124 ( with maximum deviation of @xmath125 arising from numerical errors in the results shown in figure [ fig : imyleft ] ) .",

    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : gv_omega020_vst0lr ] for the off - resonant transport regime with and without dynamical renormalisation .",
    "with renormalisation of the left contact , the conductance values decrease with increasing coupling @xmath163 to the leads while the conductance peaks broaden .",
    "this is seen more clearly in the right panel of figure  [ fig : gv_omega020_vst0lr ] where the rescale conductance @xmath164 is plotted such that the main resonance peak has an amplitude of 1 .    in the presence of dynamical renormalisation of the @xmath0 contact",
    ", the main conductance peak follows the same behaviour as in the absence of renormalisation . however , one observes a highly non - linear behaviour of the modification of the first vibron side - band peak .",
    "the complete and detailed understanding of such modification is rather complex , and beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however it is strongly related to the new features in the renormalised @xmath0 lead embedding potential which depart from the non - interacting case .",
    "we have studied the transport properties through a two - terminal nanoscale device with interactions present not only in the central region but also with interaction crossing at the interface between the left lead and the central region . to calculate the current for such a fully - interacting system , we have used our recently developed quantum transport formula @xcite based on the negf formalism . as a first practical application ,",
    "we have considered a prototypical single - molecule nanojunction with electron - vibron interaction . in terms of the electron density matrix ,",
    "the interaction is diagonal in the central region for the first vibron mode and off - diagonal between the central region and the left electrode for the second vibron mode .",
    "the interaction self - energies are calculated in a self - consistent manner using the lowest order hartree - fock - like diagram in the central region and a quasi - particle ( dynamical mean - field - like ) approach for the crossing interaction .",
    "our calculations were performed for different transport regimes ranging from the far off - resonance to the quasi - resonant regime , and for a wide range of parameter values .",
    "they show that , for this model , we obtain a non - equilibrium ( i.e. bias dependent ) dynamical ( i.e. energy dependent ) renormalisation of the generalised embedding potential of the @xmath0 left lead .",
    "the renormalisation is such that the amplitude of the corresponding spectral function is reduced around the molecular level energy @xmath53 over an energy range roughly equal to the energy support of the spectral density of the central region @xmath9 .",
    "this corresponds a reduction of the number of transport channels in the left lead at given energy , even if the total spectral weight of the @xmath0 embedding potential is conserved .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamical renormalisation of the @xmath0 contact is highly non - linear and non - monotonic in function of the applied bias , and the larger effects occur at applied bias for which features are present in both the spectral function of the central region @xmath9 and the generalised embedding potential of the @xmath0 lead .",
    "the conductance is affected by the ne renormalisation of the contact : the amplitude of the main resonance peak is modified as well as the lineshape of the first vibron side - band peak .",
    "finally , extensions of the present study are now considered to go beyond the quasi - particle approach for the crossing interaction self - energy by including as well as the lesser and greater components of the @xmath18 interface self - energy .",
    "this should lead to dynamical ne renormalisation of the contact involving inelastic scattering processes .",
