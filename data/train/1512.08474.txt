    "a subtlety in the cut - and - paste approach needs to be emphasized . in this work ,",
    "the surface energy density is always negative for the ( cut - and - paste ) thin - shell traversable wormholes .",
    "@xcite due to the definition of the normals on the junction interface , as compared to working with gravastars , a few strategic sign flips arise in the context of these thin - shell traversable wormhole configurations .",
    "@xcite thus , the possibility of a vanishing surface energy density exists for a wide class of thin - shell configurations .",
    "@xcite in the latter context , one can also consider an alternative approach  by matching interior spherically symmetric wormhole solutions to an exterior vacuum geometry .",
    "furthermore , the stability of the thin - shell to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations around static solutions was analysed .",
    "novel wormhole solutions were found , that were supported by a matter content that minimally violates the null energy condition .",
