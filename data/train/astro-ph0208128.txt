    "chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) and xmm newton observations of cas a show that the jet and counter jet and associated structure are observable in the x - ray and that the intermediate mass elements are ejected in a roughly toroidal configuration ( hughes et al . 2000 ; hwang et al .",
    "2000 ; willingale et al .",
    "hst observations of the debris of sn  1987a show that the ejecta are asymmetric with an axis that roughly aligns with the small axis of the rings ( pun et al . 2001 ; wang et al .",
    "spectropolarimetry shows that substantial asymmetry is ubiquitous in core - collapse supernovae , and that a significant fraction of core - collapse supernovae have a bi - polar structure ( wang et al .",
    "1996 , 2001 ) .",
    "the strength of the asymmetry observed with polarimetry is higher ( several % ) in supernovae of type ib and ic that represent exploding bare non - degenerate cores ( wang et al .",
    "the degree of asymmetry also rises as a function of time for type ii supernovae ( from @xmath7 1% to @xmath8 1% ) as the ejecta expand and the photosphere recedes ( wang et al .",
    "2001 ; leonard et al . 2000 , 2001 ) . both of these trends suggest that it is the core collapse mechanism itself that is responsible for the asymmetry .",
    "two possibilities are being actively explored to account for the observed asymmetries .",
    "one is associated with the rotational effect on convection ( fryer & heger 2000 ) and another is due to the effect of jets ( khokhlov et al . 1999 ; wheeler et al . 2000 ; wheeler , meier & wilson 2002 ) .",
    "the time scale of neutrino emission is short compared to the dynamical time of the overlying stellar mantle and envelope .",
    "neutrino asymmetries can yield short - lived , impulsive effects ( shimizu , et al . 1994 ; burrows & hayes 1996 ; lai et al . 2001 ) , but there are questions of whether expansion and transverse pressure gradients will eliminate transient asymmetries before homologous expansion is achieved ( chevalier & soker 1989 ) .",
    "rayleigh  taylor and richtmyer ",
    "meshkov instabilities might produce `` finger '' asymmetries that are preserved , but it is unclear that such finer scale perturbations can reproduce the common feature of a single symmetry axis that is substantially independent of space and time ( wang et al .",
    "jet calculations have established that non - relativistic axial jets of energy of order @xmath9 erg originating within the collapsed core can initiate a bi - polar asymmetric supernova explosion that is consistent with the spectropolarimetry ( khokhlov et al .",
    "1999 ; khokhlov & hflich 2001 ; hflich et al .",
    "the result is that heavy elements ( e.g. o , ca ) are characteristically ejected in tori along the equator .",
    "iron , silicon and other heavy elements in cas a are distributed in this way ( hwang et al .",
    "2000 ) , and there is some evidence for this distribution in sn 1987a ( wang et al .",
    "2002 ) . radioactive matter ejected in the jets can alter the ionization structure and hence the shape of the photosphere of the envelope even if the density structure is spherically symmetric ( hflich et al .",
    "this will generate a finite polarization , even though the density distribution is spherical and the jets are stopped deep within the star and may account for the early polarization observed in type ii supernovae ( leonard et al .",
    "2000 ; wang et al .",
    "if one of the pair of axial jets is somewhat stronger than the other , jets can , in principle , also account for pulsar runaway velocities that are parallel to the spin axis ( helfand et al . 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "while a combination neutrino  induced / jet  induced explosion may prove necessary for complete understanding of core - collapse explosions , jets of the strength computed by khokhlov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are sufficient for supernova explosions . in this paper",
    ", we will explore the possible conditions that could lead to the formation of buoyant bi - polar mhd outflow .",
    "immediately after the discovery of pulsars there were suggestions that rotation and magnetic fields could be a significant factor in the explosion mechanism ( ostriker & gunn 1971 ; bisnovatyi - kogan 1971 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & ruzmaikin 1976 ; kundt 1976 ) .",
    "typical dipole fields of @xmath10 g and rotation periods of several to several tens of milliseconds yield electrodynamic power of @xmath11 erg s@xmath6 that is insufficient to produce a strong explosion .",
    "the evidence for asymmetries and the possibility that bi - polar flows or jets can account for the observations suggest that this issue must be revisited .",
    "the fact that pulsars like those in the crab and vela remnants have jet - like protrusions ( weisskopf et al . 2000 ; helfand et al .",
    "2001 ) also encourages this line of thought .",
    "the present - day jets in young pulsars may be vestiges of much more powerful mhd jets that occurred when the pulsar was born .",
    "the transient values of the magnetic field and rotation could have greatly exceeded those observed today . tapping that energy to power the explosion could be the very mechanism that results in the modest values of rotation and field the pulsars display after the ejecta",
    "have dispersed .    in the current context",
    ", one would like to know not only whether or not the rotation and magnetic field of a nascent neutron star can power the supernova explosion , but , specifically , whether or not bi - polar flows or jets form and whether or not they are sufficiently energetic to drive the explosion . possible physical mechanisms for inducing axial flows , asymmetric supernovae , and related phenomena driven by magnetorotational effects were considered by wheeler et al .",
    "the means of amplifying magnetic fields by linear wrapping associated with differential rotation in the neutron star and possibly by an @xmath12  ",
    "@xmath13 dynamo were discussed . whereas wheeler et al .",
    "( 2000 ) focused on the effect of the resulting net dipole field , wheeler , meier , & wilson ( 2002 ) recognized that the toroidal field would be the dominant component of the magnetic field and explored the capacity of the toroidal field to directly generate axial jets by analogy with magneto - centrifugal models of jets in active galactic nuclei ( koide et al .",
    "2000 ; and references therein ) .",
    "wheeler , meier , & wilson ( 2002 ) found that the production of a strong toroidal field , substantially stronger than the @xmath10 g field of a pulsar , and strong axial jets driven by that field are possible .",
    "a caveat to consider is that wheeler , meier , & wilson ( 2002 ) again considered only amplification of the field by  wrapping , \" a process that only increases the field linearly , and hence rather slowly in time . while conditions of very rapid rotation might exist that lead to a sufficiently rapid growth of the magnetic field , that is not guaranteed .",
    "in addition , reconnection might limit the field before it can be wrapped the thousands of times necessary to be interesting . here",
    "we consider the effects of magnetic shearing , the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ) , on the strongly shearing environment that must exist in a nascent neutron star .",
    "this instability is expected to lead to the rapid exponential growth of the magnetic field with characteristic time scale of order the rotational period . while this instability has been widely explored in the context of accretion disks ,",
    "this is the first time it has been applied to core collapse .",
    "we will argue that this instability must inevitably occur in core collapse , that it is likely to be the dominant mechanism for the production of magnetic flux in the context of core collapse , and that it has the capacity to produce fields that are sufficiently strong to affect , if not cause , the explosion .",
    "in  2 we describe our assumptions by which we treat the angular momentum and field amplification in the context of a numerical collapse calculation . in  3 , we present the results of these calculations .",
    "section 4 presents a discussion and conclusions .",
    "the collapse of a model iron core of a 15 m@xmath14 progenitor is simulated with a one - dimensional flux - limited diffusion code @xcite that computes radial profiles for various quantities .",
    "the core collapse code does not include rotation , convection , or magnetic fields . to treat rotation of the iron core ,",
    "we attribute various initial rotational profiles to the initial density profile .",
    "the evolution of the angular velocity profile @xmath15 is then computed using the radial density profiles produced by the core collapse code assuming that the specific angular momentum of a given shell is constant (  2.1 ) .",
    "the magnetic field is obtained using the @xmath16 , @xmath15 , and @xmath17 profiles according to the theory of the mri (  2.2 ) .",
    "the dynamical feedback of the magnetic field through mechanisms such as magnetic pressure , torque , and hoop stress are neglected here .",
    "the mhd luminosity is estimated using the magnetic field calculated (  2.3 ) .    in this calculation , the initial iron core of 1.5 m@xmath14 forms a collapsing homologous core of mass 0.69 m@xmath14 .",
    "the bounce occurs about 166 ms after the onset of collapse and the shock forms at the boundary of the initial homologous core at a radius of 13.8 km .",
    "after bounce , the outer boundary of the protoneutron star ( pns ) extends to about 80  90 km . the bounce shock reaches 500 km at about 120 ms after bounce where it stalls and remains at about this radius for the duration of the calculation . between the boundary of the pns and the shock radius , there is a region of transition where shock  heated material settles onto the pns . by 210",
    "ms after bounce , the pns develops a core in hydrostatic equilibrium ( v @xmath18 100 km  s@xmath6 ) with radius 9 km and mass 0.2 m@xmath19 .",
    "the hydrostatic core grows out to 24.4 km and 0.69 m@xmath19 by 350 ms and stays constant to the end of the simulation .",
    "the hydrostatic core mass of the pns at this time encompasses all the initial homologous core mass , 0.69 m@xmath19 .",
    "although the original homologous core and the hydrostatic core have the same mass , the size of the pns core is larger because the density decreases after bounce .",
    "the evolution of massive stars can be significantly affected by their rotation @xcite , metallicity @xcite , and mass loss @xcite .",
    "massive stars that are the progenitors of core collapse supernovae are known to be rapid rotators as main sequence stars with mean @xmath20 ranging from 100 km s@xmath6 to 300 km",
    "s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the number ratio of be to b - type stars increases as the local metallicity decreases , suggesting that massive stars rotate faster in lower metallicity environments . according to the parameterization of mass loss rates employed by @xcite ,",
    "the mass loss rates are enhanced by faster rotation and higher metallicity .",
    "evolved stars are also observed to have higher mass loss rates .",
    "these effects are interdependent .",
    "although mass loss significantly influences the evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram , it does not affect the evolution of the central core since after the he burning phase the core evolves independently from the envelope @xcite .",
    "effects of the magnetic field on stellar evolution @xcite may influence the timing of the decoupling between the core and the envelope @xcite , which could affect the final angular momentum of the core .",
    "it is important to understand the evolution in both the envelope and the core of the progenitor star up to the precollapse stage since the outcome of core collapse may depend significantly on the precollapse conditions . for our study ,",
    "the structure of the precollapse iron core , including the angular momentum distribution , is of particular significance .",
    "the first calculations of the redistribution of angular momentum in the evolution of rotating massive stars were carried by @xcite , who obtained angular velocity profiles up to the ignition of carbon burning .",
    "the evolution of the angular momentum distribution of massive stars up to the onset of core collapse was recently simulated by @xcite for supernova progenitors ( 8@xmath21  @xmath22 ) with solar composition .",
    "this study included the effects of rotation and angular momentum transport with mass loss .",
    "they found that the final specific angular momentum distribution prior to core collapse had no dependence on the initial surface velocity and only a weak dependence on the initial mass ; larger initial masses attain smaller specific angular momenta prior to collapse because higher mass loss rates carry away more angular momentum .",
    "@xcite also found that the @xmath15 profile in the precollapse core is not a smooth function of radius , but consists of step functions at fossil convective shell boundaries .",
    "the @xmath23 model of @xcite attains an angular velocity of 10 rad s@xmath6 ( see their fig .",
    "8) in the center of the iron core at the precollapse stage .",
    "these simulations did not include the effects of a magnetic field .",
    "it is possible that the iron core rotates more slowly if the effect of magnetic braking is included @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the rotational effects on pure hydrodynamic core collapse explosions with initial velocity profiles obtained by @xcite with a central rotational velocity of 4 rad s@xmath6 .",
    "we adopt the initial angular velocity profile , @xmath24 , of @xcite ( hereafter called the fh profile ) as one case to study .",
    "an analytical form of the @xmath24 profile had been adopted in some previous work @xcite .",
    "one representation of the profile takes the form @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 cm ( hereafter called the mm profile ) .",
    "the fh and mm profiles with @xmath27 rad s@xmath6 resemble each other @xcite , except that the mm profile is a continuous function , and the fh profile is broken by steps . the pioneering work on core collapse supernova explosions of rotating stars by @xcite employed an initial solid body rotation with 0.7 rad s@xmath6 .",
    "we adopt the following three profiles for this study ; solid body , mm , and fh profiles , as illustrated in fig .",
    "these profiles are scaled by the central value of @xmath28 that we choose to range from 0.2 to 10 rad s@xmath6 .",
    "as the collapse progresses , the pns will rotate near breakup speed for sufficiently high @xmath24 .",
    "the solid body case is most susceptible to this problem . for this work ,",
    "we monitor the rotation and omit cases that are not approximately self - consistent with our spherically - symmetric treatment ( although not necessarily unphysical ) .",
    "the adopted profiles that we study in detail have small enough angular momentum that little departure from spherical geometry will occur .",
    "once an @xmath24 profile is adopted , the @xmath15 profile is computed using the radial density profiles produced by the core collapse code described above .",
    "we assume that the specific angular momentum is conserved between consecutive time steps as follows : @xmath29 where the primed quantities represent the future time step ( the appropriate expressions for finite shells in difference form was used in the code as applied below ) .",
    "it is inevitable that the collapsing core spins up and generates strong differential rotation for very general choices of the @xmath24 profile , since the inner regions collapse larger relative distances than the outer regions .",
    "a strong shear must form at the boundary of the pns . at bounce",
    ", the original homologous core has a positive gradient in @xmath15 , but by 210 ms after bounce , this gradient has nearly disappeared and after that the gradient is monotonically negative outward ( see below ; figs .",
    "[ difrot ] , [ srot ] ) .",
    "@xcite noted that the collapse of a white dwarf to a pns gives a positive @xmath15 gradient since the relativistic degenerate core of the white dwarf has a steeper density profile than the pns .",
    "the pns will thus be relatively more compact for a given central density .",
    "there are two important differences in the current calculations .",
    "the most critical is that we are not considering a core collapsing in isolation as for the accretion - induced collapse scenario .",
    "rather , the pns forms within the massive star collapse ambience , and the pns must be strongly differentially rotating with respect to the still - infalling matter .",
    "this will generate a strong shear at the boundary of the pns that would not pertain to a collapsing isolated white dwarf .",
    "another , more subtle , difference is the equation of state . here",
    "we are considering the collapse of a partially degenerate iron core to a pns .",
    "the equation of state is not as different as for the highly relativistic white dwarf collapsing to non - relativistic neutron star .",
    "an examination of the relative density profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ rho_norm ] reveals that the homologous core at bounce is somewhat less centrally condensed than the original iron core ; this results in the temporary positive gradient in @xmath13 within the homologous core as shown below in figs .",
    "[ difrot ] , [ srot ] .",
    "about 50 ms after bounce , the density profile is nearly identical to that of the initial iron core , giving the nearly flat rotation profile shown below . after that , the density profile becomes somewhat more centrally condensed than the original iron core and the rotation profile decreases monotonically outward even deep within the pns .",
    "the mri generates turbulence in a magnetized rotating fluid body that amplifies the magnetic field and transfers angular momentum . in this paper",
    "we attempt , for the first time , to apply the physics of the mri to the core collapse supernova environment where the mri criterion is broadly satisfied .",
    "the mri should pertain in this environment and amplify the magnetic field exponentially and perhaps , in turn , power mhd bi - polar flow or jets .",
    "key questions are the amplitude of the magnetic field and the effect on the dynamics .",
    "those two questions are deeply related , but with the limitations of this proof - of - principle study in mind , we will estimate the strength of the magnetic field due to the mri during the core collapse process and postpone a study of feedback effects to a later work .    ignoring entropy gradients for the moment , the condition for the instability of the slow magnetosonic waves in a magnetized , differentially rotating plasma is @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "when the magnetic field is very small , and/or the wavelength is very long , @xmath32 is negligible , and the instability criterion for the mri is simply that the angular velocity gradient be negative @xcite , i.e. : @xmath33    the growth of the magnetic field associated with the mri is exponential with characteristic time scale of order @xmath0 since @xmath34 .",
    "the time scale for the maximum growing mode is given by @xcite : @xmath35 we thus expect the mri to dominate any process such as `` wrapping of field lines '' ( see wheeler et al . 2000 and references therein ) that only grows linearly in time , even if on about the same time scale .",
    "the mri will also operate under conditions of moderate rotation that are not sufficient to compete with the pns convective time scales to drive the sort of @xmath12    @xmath13 dynamo invoked by , e.g. , duncan & thompson ( 1992 ) .",
    "the resulting unstable flow is expected to become non - linear , develop turbulence , and drive a dynamo that amplifies and sustains the field .",
    "the field will grow because of the mri dynamo action until it reaches a saturation field limit .",
    "the details of the dynamo action due to mhd turbulence are beyond the scope of this paper , and we ignore the effect of the turbulence on the hydrodynamics .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate for the saturation field can be obtained by equating the shearing length scale @xmath36 to the characteristic mode scale @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting saturation magnetic field is given by : @xmath38 this is the same result as obtained by setting the alfvn velocity equal to the local rotational velocity , @xmath39 .",
    "in the subsequent discussion , we will adopt the field in eq .",
    "( [ bsat ] ) as the fiducial saturation field .",
    "note that this expression does not depend on the shear , although the field growth in this case will depend on the shear through the instability criterion .",
    "another simple estimate of the saturation field is to set the mode length equal to the local radius , on the grounds that the mode can not be larger in wavelength than the physical size of the region in which it grows .",
    "the resulting saturation field is : @xmath40 this differs from the previous estimate only by the logarithmic gradient of @xmath13 , a factor normally of order unity .",
    "the empirical value of the saturation field obtained by the numerical simulation of @xcite is : @xmath41 this saturation field is achieved after turbulence is fully established , which takes about 20 rotations following the initial exponential growth @xcite . the field of eq .",
    "( [ bsim ] ) is another possible saturation limit .",
    "note that for conditions of rotation at much less than keplerian , to which we restrict the current analysis , these saturation fields and that to be described below , represent fields that are much less than the equipartition field , for which @xmath42 is comparable to the ambient pressure , i.e. for the current calculations , @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ vel ] ) .",
    "another means of estimating the saturation field considers the mri mode that grows at the maximum rate ( eq .",
    "( [ growth - time ] ) ) .",
    "when a vertical field exists , the maximum unstable growing mode @xcite implies a saturation field of : @xmath44,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the wavelength of the maximum growing mode .",
    "once again , we argue that this fastest growing mode must be contained in the physical region in which growth occurs , so the wavelength is not allowed to exceed the local radius @xmath46 . with @xmath47 , eq .",

    "yet another variation would be to set the wavelength of the maximum growing mode equal to the shear length , but all these variations just yield differences of order @xmath49 .",
    "note that for the maximum growing mode the expression for @xmath50 acquires a negative value when @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the epicyclic frequency : @xmath53 when eq .",
    "( [ omega - limits ] ) is true , the epicyclic motion dominates over the mri and prevents growth of the perturbation . in practice",
    ", the gradient of @xmath13 may be reduced by mixing due to the epicyclic motion , and the mri may eventually be active in a region in which it was at first suppressed by a strong negative gradient of @xmath15 . in this work",
    ", we simply turned off field amplification when this condition arose , thus , perhaps , minimizing the actual effect of the mri .    in many cases , including our collapsing core , the background gas is unstable to convection due to an entropy gradient .",
    "the previous discussion can be modified to take this effect into account . when differentially rotating gas is unstable to the mri and stable to convection , a perturbed fluid element experiences a stabilizing force due to the convective stability .",
    "therefore , convective stability tends to stabilize the mri .",

    "it is possible that the neutrino flux affects the magnetic buoyancy ( thompson & murray 2002 ) and that the magnetic fields affect the neutrino emissivity @xcite and interactions with the plasma ( laming 1999 ) . the time scale for shear viscosity due to neutrino diffusion is much longer than the times of interest here , although magnetic fields and turbulence can make it shorter @xcite .",
    "the mri provides magnetic field and turbulence , so this issue deserves further study .",
    "in addition to affecting the shear , the neutrino viscosity might also affect the turbulence needed to make the mri work . using the expression for the neutrino viscosity at sub - nuclear densities from @xcite",
    ", @xmath148 gives a reynolds number @xmath149 near the pns boundary at @xmath150 cm with @xmath151 rad s@xmath6 .",
    "this could decrease to re @xmath152 near the standing shock where the density is lower .",
    "the former is probably large enough to sustain turbulence in the strong shear , but the latter might not be .    when viscosity dominates the dissipation in a collisional plasma , the growth condition that the field growth time be less than the dissipation time yields a constraint on the magnetic field @xcite : @xmath153 this equation implies that b must exceed @xmath154 g near the boundary of the pns where t @xmath155 mev and smaller values in cooler portions at larger radii .",
    "even compression of moderate fields in the iron core should exceed this threshold .",
    "we note that if one were to use the expression for the neutrino viscosity from eq .",
    "( [ nuvisc ] ) , the corresponding limit on the field would exceed @xmath156 g for similar parameters . this limit may not be relevant , however , since in order to use the fluid equations , rather than a kinetic theory , to describe the instability and its damping , the physical lengthscale associated with the viscosity , the mean free path of the dissipative particles , must be substantially less than the damping scale of the turbulence .",
    "this is not likely to be the case for neutrinos in the vicinity of the region of maximum shear in this problem .",
    "the damping length where re @xmath1 1 would be about @xmath157 of @xmath158 cm or about 10 cm from eq .",
    "( [ reynolds ] ) , whereas the mean free path of the neutrinos ( neglecting blocking and other complications ) is about @xmath159 cm at the density of @xmath160 g  @xmath161 and temperature of about 10 mev that characterize the region of maximum shear @xcite . there may be regions deep in the neutron star where the neutrino mean free path is short enough that this becomes an issue , but we do not think that the neutrinos can affect the eddy turnover and instability of the mri in regions that are significant for maximum field growth .",
    "an obvious imperative is to now understand the behavior of the strong magnetic fields we believe are likely to be attendant to any core collapse situation .",
    "the fields will generate strong pressure tensor anisotropies that can lead to dynamic response even when the magnetic pressure is small compared to the isotropic ambient gas pressure . as argued in wheeler , meier & wilson ( 2002 ) , a dominant toroidal component is a natural condition to form a collimated magnetorotational wind , and hence polar flow .",
    "a first example of driving a polar flow with the mri is given by @xcite . a key ingredient to force flow up the axis and to collimate",
    "it is the hoop stress from the resulting field .",
    "we have examined the acceleration implied by the hoop stresses of the fields we have derived here , @xmath162 .",
    "we find that the hoop stresses corresponding to the peak saturation fields can be competitive with , and even exceed , the net acceleration of the pressure gradient and gravity .",
    "the large scale toroidal field is thus likely to affect the dynamics by accelerating matter inward along cylindrical radii .",
    "the flow , thus compressed , is likely to be channeled up the rotation axes to begin the bi - polar flow that will be further accelerated by hoop and torsional stresses from the field , the  spring and fling \" outlined in wheeler et al .",
    "the mri is expected to yield a combination of large scale and small scale magnetic fields .",
    "even the small scale fields in the turbulent magnetized medium may act like a viscoelastic fluid that would tend to drive circulation in along the equator and up the rotation axis @xcite where the same small scale fields could collimate and stabilize the flow even in the absence of large scale toroidal fields @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", small scale fields can result in dissipation by reconnection , an issue that we have not treated here , relying implicitly on the numerical simulations that show a growth in the field that is not eliminated by such effects .",
    "the dynamics of these jets may depart substantially from pure hydrodynamical jets , since they will tend to preserve the flux in the poynting flow and reconnection can accelerate the matter ( see spruit , daigne & drenkhahn 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the poloidal component of the field can be another contributor to plasma waves ( wheeler et al .",
    "2000 ) .    for a complete understanding of the physics in a core collapse supernova explosion ,",
    "a combination of neutrino  induced and jet  induced explosion may be required . understanding the myriad implications of this statement will be a rich exploration .",
