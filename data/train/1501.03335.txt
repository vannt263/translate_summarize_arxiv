    "circular annular josephson tunnel junctions ( jtjs ) , consisting of two superconducting rings coupled by a thin dielectric tunneling layer were recognized to be the ideal benchmark to test both the statics and the dynamics of sine - gordon solitons in the presence of a periodic potential@xcite . in this context , a soliton is a current vortex , also called a josephson vortex or a fluxon , circulating around the junction and carrying one magnetic flux quantum .",
    "a spatially periodic potential for the fluxon can be easily implemented by a uniform magnetic field applied in the plane of the annulus . however , for jtjs having a not simply - connected topology the most general and at the same time regular geometry is provided by an elliptic annulus . at variance with a circle that has infinitely many axes of symmetry , an ellipse has two axes of symmetry .",
    "this geometrical symmetry breaking which comes with an associated non - uniformity of the radius of curvature has been exploited in several physical systems , e.g. , to increase the focal depth@xcite or the resolving power@xcite of annular apertures and as antenna reflectors in the microwave region@xcite .",
    "elliptic annular josephson tunnel junctions ( eajtjs ) serve as an handy tool for the realization of complex periodic potentials , including those lacking spatial reflection symmetry , known as ratchet potentials@xcite .",
    "an additional motivation to study eajtjs is the intention to cast in one unique class many apparently different jtj configurations , including the linear geometry commonly studied in the context of jtjs .    in this article",
    "we focus our attention on the static configurations of the phase in eajtjs ; the dynamics of solitons will be the subject of another article . most of the work will be focused on eajtjs having the so called _ lyngby - type _",
    "geometry@xcite , that refers to a specularly symmetric configuration in which the height of the current carrying electrodes matches one of the ellipse outer axis ( e.g. see figures  [ layout](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "we have measured the dependence of the zero - voltage josephson current for a large number of samples .",
    "the experimental data are compared with the analytical results and with the numerical results obtained by solving the appropriate partial differential equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we first consider a quater - elliptic annular junction immersed in a uniform in - plane magnetic field and derive the threshold curves for junctions having different ellipticity ; later we extend the analysis to full ellipses with possible josephson vortices trapped in the annular barrier . in section",
    "iii we derive the appropriate partial differential equation for an electrically long eajtj ; later we present the results of the numerical simulations and outline the effects of the magnetic field induced by the junction bias current .",
    "thereafter , we investigate the consequences of a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the junction plane for different geometrical configurations ; for lyngby - type samples we establish the equivalence between a transverse magnetic field and an in - plane magnetic field applied along the flow of the bias current . besides , we suggest a simple geometrical configuration that implements the ideal step - like deterministic periodic ratchet potential . in section",
    "v we describe the fabrication of our @xmath0-@xmath1 samples , the different geometries that have been realized and the experimental setup ; finally , we present and discuss the experimental data of long eajtjs with both in - plane and transverse magnetic fields .",

    "in fact , each lobe in figures  [ 2and4pi ] is associated with a given vortex structure ; at the very end of the first lobe a fluxon - antifluxon pair is present along the junction , the fluxon facing the antifluxon on diametrically opposed potential wells created by the magnetic field at the ellipse s poles . in the successive lobes the magnetic field penetrates in the barrier and",

    ", the symmetry of the system requires that the supercurrent , @xmath232 , flowing along the top electrode within a distance of @xmath233 from the josephson barrier is null at the equatorial points and equally distributes in each annulus branch ; this supercurrent increases as we move towards the poles where it must be equal to @xmath234 , since @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath237 flows within a width , @xmath238 , that is constant all along the ellipse perimeter .",
    "this can be better understood looking at figure  [ selffield](b ) which sketches the vertical cross section along the equatorial line of our lyngby - type eajtjs .",
    "the oblique arrows in figure  [ selffield](a ) indicate the strength and direction of the normal component of magnetic field associated ( and proportional ) to the tangential supercurrent @xmath237 that is inversely proportional to @xmath238 .",
    "we can make a similar reasoning for the current , @xmath239 , flowing in the bottom electrode ( within a depth @xmath240 ) with the caveats that @xmath239 flows on the opposite side of the barrier so its normal field has opposite direction and , above all , @xmath239 flows within a width equal to ( and where possible larger than ) @xmath241 that , in turn , is larger than @xmath238 .",

    "further , the @xmath4-component of the normal self - field is larger for oblate ellipses ( @xmath244 ) and vice versa .",
    "the @xmath4-component affects the profile of the josephson phase , therefore , as @xmath231 is increased we will reach a value that makes the junction to prematurely switch to the voltage state ( the largest critical current always corresponds to the uniform phase distribution , @xmath245 ) . in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field , the system symmetry is broken and , in general , the bias current splits in unequal parts giving rise also to a net @xmath3-component of the normal self - field which is larger for oblate geometries ( @xmath246 ) . in a first approximation , as already heuristically suggested for ring - shaped junctions@xcite , the self - field effects in long eajtjs can be taken into account in eq.([diff1 ] ) by adding extra terms which simulate two uniform fields , one parallel , @xmath247 , and the other orthogonal , @xmath248 , to the bias current flow .",
    "we should also add that , even neglecting the self - field effects , a bias current density which is uniform in @xmath9 can never be achieved in ajtjs .",
    "if the bias current , @xmath231 , were uniformly distributed along the height of the current carrying electrode , @xmath249 would be peaked at the equatorial points of the ellipse .",
    "however , the current in a superconducting flat film mainly flows at its boundaries@xcite , therefore , more realistically , the @xmath250 profile is depressed at the equatorial points and is largest at the poles . although symmetric , a non - uniform current density profile , together with the self - fields , reduces the largest possible value of the critical current . in the experiments ,",
    "the ratio of the zero - field critical current , @xmath251 , to the current jump , @xmath252 , at the gap voltage is a direct measure of this nonuniformity : the lower this ratio , the larger is the nonuniformity .",
    "an alternative way to modulate the critical current of a planar josephson tunnel junction is to apply a magnetic field , @xmath254 , perpendicular to the junction plane@xcite , which induces shielding currents in its electrodes . in turn , the shielding currents generate a local magnetic field whose normal component thread the josephson barrier .",
    "the modulation amplitude drastically depends on the geometry of the electrodes and on how close to the barrier the shielding currents circulate . for rectangular junctions these effects",
    "have been already investigated both theoretically and experimentally@xcite ; for ring shaped junctions only magnetostatic simulations and experimental data exist , and a theoretical understanding is still lacking . here , in addition , we will analyse how a transverse field acts on an eajtj ; more specifically , we want to derive the normal component of the magnetic field induced by the the circulating shielding currents .",
    "we will consider three different geometries formed by specularly symmetric electrodes whose bottom electrodes are shown in figures  [ bottomelectrodes](a)-(c ) .",
    "we will take in consideration that for window - type junctions the elliptic loops in the bottom and top / wiring electrodes have the same mean axes , i.e. , the same perimeter and ellipticity , but different widths ( respectively , @xmath255 and @xmath256 ) .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , the analysis will be carried out assuming that no flux is trapped in the electrode loops .",
    "the island or @xmath257-biased@xcite geometry , in which each electrode is fed by a very tin thread , is the easiest to analyze since in the josephson region the electrodes have constant widths .",
    "let us consider first the bottom electrode sketched in figure  [ bottomelectrodes](a ) . when a magnetic field , @xmath258 , is applied perpendicular to the loop plane",
    ", then a shielding current , @xmath259 , circulates in the loop to restore the initial flux@xcite , where @xmath260 is the effective flux capture area of the loop in the bottom electrode and @xmath261 is the inductance of a thin - film elliptic ( narrow ) loop .",
    "what really matters is the magnetic flux @xmath262 applied to ( although not threading ) the loop ; to a very high degree of approximation the capture area in this case is the loop inner area @xmath263 . applying the ampere s circuital law to the ( tangential ) shielding current , @xmath264",
    ", we easily derive the normal magnetic field , @xmath265 , where @xmath266 is the conversion factor from the transverse to the barrier - parallel field@xcite .",
    "if we now consider the top / wiring electrode , for symmetry reasons and considering that the shielding current circulates on the opposite side of the barrier , we have that @xmath267 . in the case of equal width annuli , then @xmath268 and",
    "the total normal field , @xmath269 , is null meaning that the field generated by the currents circulating in the top electrode fully compensates that produced by the shielding currents induced in the bottom one .",
    "however , in general , @xmath270 and the total normal field is uniform and proportional to the transverse field , @xmath271 ; therefore , for short eajtjs it gives rise to fraunhofer - like threshold curves . to demonstrate this we resort to eq.([gra ] ) in elliptic coordinates , @xmath272= @xmath273 , which , in our one - dimensional approximation , yields @xmath274 . by integrating @xmath275 and introducing the dimensionless field @xmath276",

    "we now analyse the modified lyngby - type geometry in which the left ( right ) side of the bottom ( top ) electrode is a semi - infinite plane ; the bottom electrode of the configuration is shown in figure  [ bottomelectrodes](b ) .",
    "on the right side of the bottom electrode , the top / wiring electrode acts as a ground plane and squeezes the field lines generated by the screening currents in such a way that most of the magnetic energy is confined between the electrodes . the inductance per unit length of such superconducting microstrip transmission line@xcite is @xmath280 , where @xmath240 is the bottom current penetration@xcite @xmath281 .",
    "we claim that the contribution to the loop inductance of the left side of the bottom electrode is negligibly small , therefore the loop inductance is given by the product of the ellipse mean semi - perimeter by the bottom inductance per unit length , @xmath282 .",
    "this inductance is much smaller than that of a free standing elliptic loop used for the island - geometry@xcite .",
    "being @xmath283 , for @xmath284 , the normal magnetic field penetrating the barrier is@xcite @xmath285 , where now the field conversion factor@xcite is @xmath286 .",
    "we note that @xmath287 is independent of @xmath241 , since the circulating current linearly increases with the strip width .",
    "the shielding currents mostly flow along the outer electrode boundary , therefore , for @xmath288 , no normal field threads the josephson barrier .",
    "if we now focus on the specularly symmetric top / wiring electrode , we have that @xmath289 for @xmath288 and zero elsewhere . here",
    "@xmath290 , with @xmath291 . summing up the contributions from both electrodes ,",
    "the total normal field is given by a @xmath102-periodic step function having different amplitudes in the two half - periods : -5pt @xmath292    starting from eq.([cases ] ) , it is not difficult to derive that for short elliptic junctions with the modified lyngby geometry in a transverse magnetic field : -5pt @xmath293    which , in the case of equal fluxes , again reduces to a pure fraunhofer pattern that only depends on the coupled flux ( and not at all on the junction ellipticity ) .",
    "it is worth to point out that , due to flux focusing effects , the effective capture area of this geometry is much larger than the ellipse inner area . as far as long junctions concerns , the normal field discontinuities at the ellipse poles result in two dirac terms in the psge in eq.([psge ] ) , corresponding@xcite to local extra conditions on the spatial phase derivative .",
    "let us consider the bottom electrode of a lyngby - type eajtj sketched in figure  [ bottomelectrodes](c ) .",
    "the loop width is constant and equal to @xmath241 , on the right side and increases when we move to the left side . with respect to the previous geometry ,",
    "this makes the transition to zero of the bottom normal field smoother as we cross the ellipse poles .",
    "the calculation of how this field vanishes when the circulating current moves away from the barrier is not an easy task , but , clearly this effect occurs faster for prolate junctions .",
    "being @xmath294 , we will suppose that the field decay only depends on @xmath79 and can be qualitatively described by the function @xmath295 plotted in figure  [ fvstau ] for different values of @xmath79 ( in the range @xmath288 ) . summarizing , the normal field , @xmath296 , generated by the screening currents circulating in the bottom electrode is given by the continuous expression : -10pt @xmath297     for @xmath298 and different @xmath79 values.,width=226 ]    analogously , for the specularly symmetric top electrode it is : -10pt @xmath299    whatever are the electrode inductance , the conversion factors are@xcite @xmath300 .",
    "the total normal field is @xmath301 , and is given by the continuous function : -10pt @xmath302        in the case of symmetric electrodes ( @xmath303 ) , the above expression greatly simplifies to @xmath304 which is the normal component of a uniform in - plane field @xmath305 applied in the direction of the @xmath3-axes , which is the direction of the current carrying electrodes . remarkably , the critical current of both short and long lyngby - type ( symmetric ) eajtjs in a transverse field is expected to modulate exactly as described in sections ii and iii for an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "this result is supported by magnetostatic simulations@xcite showing that for lyngby - type ring - shaped junctions in presence of a transverse field the normal magnetic field has a sinusoidal dependence on the polar angle @xmath16 , independent of the annulus radius .",
    "later on , it was experimentally proved@xcite ( although at that time not explained ) that the field conversion factor @xmath306 of lyngby - type ring - shaped junctions increases linearly with the mean radius , @xmath20 ; this is consistent with the capture area proportional to @xmath307 and an inductance proportional to @xmath20 ( as in the case of the modified lyngby geometry )",
    ". further support of the validity of eq.([total ] ) will be provided by the experimental data reported in section v.    with @xmath308 , eq.([total ] ) results in an asymmetric field profile , @xmath309 .",
    "the consequences resulting from the asymmetric boundary conditions imposed by a non - uniform external magnetic field at the extremities of both short and long linear josephson junctions have recently been investigated ; the field asymmetry is responsible for a degeneracy of the ( extrapolated ) critical field , @xmath310 , that was numerically demonstrated@xcite and experimentally verified@xcite .",
    "asymmetric field profiles in long josephson junctions were recently looked for@xcite in order to exploit the rectifying property@xcite of a ratchet potential .",
    "it is easy to recognize that the configuration depicted in figure  [ ratchet ] ( bottom electrode in gray and top / wiring electrode in black ) implements the ideal step - like deterministic ratchet potential with the normal field being constant on the left side ( @xmath311 ) and null on the right side .    -15pt",
    "using the well known and reliable selective niobium anodization process@xcite we have realized high - quality window - type @xmath0-@xmath1 eajtjs .",
    "the details of the trilayer deposition and of the fabrication process can be found elsewhere@xcite . as shown by the photograph in figure  [ layout](a ) , two lyngby - type elliptic annular junctions , named @xmath312 and @xmath313 ,",
    "were made having the same eccentricity , but rotated @xmath314 relative to one another .",
    "the junction minor and major inner axes were , respectively , @xmath315 and @xmath316 and the nominal annulus width was @xmath317 : however , due to different anodization conditions from wafer to wafer , the effective width was in the range of @xmath318-@xmath319 .",
    "figure  [ layout](b ) shows in more details the chip layout in which the elliptic tunnel barrier is sandwiched between two simply connected superconducting layers ; the top / wiring layer ( in blue ) is shifted slightly upward with respect to the bottom layer ( in red ) .    niobium anodic oxide ( @xmath320 thick ) and an extra dielectric layer made of rf - sputtered silicon dioxide ( @xmath321 thick ) provided the electrical insulation between the base electrode and the wiring film around the junction area .",
    "this @xmath322 thick insulating by - layer outside the elliptic ring , also called idle region , alters both the static and dynamic properties of the junctions ; on linear one - dimensional long junctions it has been proved by both numerical simulation@xcite and experiments@xcite that , as far as the static properties are concerned , the only effect of the idle region is to increase the magnetic energy stored in the fluxons , i.e. , it introduces a scaling factor on the field strength .",
    "the different widths of the narrow part of the base and top electrodes , respectively , @xmath323 and @xmath324 , result in a lack of full specular symmetry of our samples .",
    "the different thicknesses of the base and top / wiring layer also contribute to the system asymmetry . for our samples",
    "the thicknesses of the base and top / wiring @xmath325 electrodes were , respectively , @xmath326 and @xmath327 , with @xmath328 , resulting in magnetic and current penetration depths of , respectively , @xmath329 and @xmath330 .",
    "furthermore , the bottom and top current penetration depths were , respectively , @xmath331 and @xmath332 . the critical current density of our samples was measured on electrically small cross - type junctions realized during the same deposition batch on different chips ; at @xmath333 , we found @xmath334 corresponding to @xmath335 .",
    "figure  [ selffield](b ) also shows that in our samples there is a @xmath336 wide idle region only on the outer left side of the junction ; taking into account this asymmetric idle region , it is @xmath337 on the junction left side . for our calculation we will use the average value @xmath338 .",
    "our setup consisted of a cryoprobe inserted vertically in a commercial @xmath339 dewar .",
    "the cryoprobe was magnetically shielded by means of two concentric @xmath340 cans and a cryoperm one ; in addition , the measurements were carried out in an rf - shielded room .",
    "the external magnetic field could be applied both in the chip plane or in the orthogonal direction .",
    "the chip was positioned in the center of a long superconducting cylindrical solenoid whose axis was along the @xmath4-direction ( see figure  [ quarterellipse ] ) to provide an in - plane magnetic field , @xmath341 .",
    "the transverse magnetic field , @xmath342 , was applied by means of a superconducting cylindrical coil with its axis oriented along the @xmath41-direction .",
    "all measurements were carried out at @xmath343k .      in this section",
    "we report the measurements carried out on junctions a and b of figure  [ layout ] having , respectively , @xmath344 and @xmath345 , according to our notations ( see figure  [ quarterellipse ] ) . for both junctions the mean",
    "perimeter is @xmath346 , i.e. , much longer than the josephson penetration depth , @xmath347 ( it is @xmath348 ) .",
    "a large number of such samples were investigated and they all showed not only the zero - field critical current , @xmath251 , but also the maximum critical current , @xmath349 , considerably smaller than about the @xmath350 of the current jump at the gap voltage , @xmath252 , typical of short @xmath0-@xmath351-@xmath352 junctions .",
    "as anticipated in section iiic , this is the first signature of a non - uniform bias current distribution and , more importantly , of the self - field effects .    figures  [ par](a)-[par](b ) display the mdps , respectively , of samples a ( @xmath353 ) and b ( @xmath354 ) with an in - plane magnetic field applied in the direction perpendicular to the bias current flow . at a first glance , we observe that both datasets are quite different from what is expected for a long eajtj with a similar normalized length ( see figure  [ 2and4pi](b ) ) . with real devices , the measurements of maximum supercurrent as a function of the external field often yield the envelop of the lobes , i.e. , the current distribution switches automatically to the mode which for a given field carries the largest supercurrent .",
    "sometimes , for a given applied field , multiple solutions are observed by sweeping the junction current - voltage characteristic many times .",
    "nevertheless , the ( first ) critical field @xmath355 can still be obtained extrapolating to zero the mdp first lobe ( see dotted line in figures  [ par](a)-[par](b ) ) . furthermore , while all the theoretical threshold curves derived in the previous sections were implicitly meant to be symmetric with respect to the bias current _ and/or _ magnetic field inversion , the experimental mdps only retain the symmetry with respect to the simultaneous inversion of the bias current _ and _ of the magnetic field .",
    "the pattern skewness is mainly to be ascribed to the @xmath4-component of the normal self - field ; in the second and fourth mdp quadrants this component adds to the external field , while in the first and third quadrants it partially compensates the applied field ; this results in different slopes of the first lobe and therefore in different ( extrapolated ) critical fields .",
    "our data are consistent with the postulate in section iiic , of the current - perpendicular self - field being larger for prolate eajtjs . in different words ,",
    "the in - plane mdp of our samples would not have been skewed , if the magnetic field were been applied in the direction of the bias current .",
    "furthermore , from the numerical simulations of figure  [ 2and4pi](b ) we expected the critical fields of junctions a and b to be , respectively , @xmath356 and @xmath357 which are close to the measured average values ( respectively , @xmath358 and @xmath359 ) .",
    "the larger @xmath360 ratio observed for junction b , can be explained by smaller current - parallel self - fields in oblate rather than prolate eajtjs , but is also consistent with the supposition that , as the height of the current carrying electrodes gets smaller , the current density profile becomes more uniform .",
    "figures  [ perp](a)-[perp](b ) display the @xmath72 vs. @xmath342 dependences of , respectively , the same junctions a and b reported in figures  [ par](a)-[par](b ) . for sample a we observe that the transverse mdp is practically indistinguishable from its in - plane counterpart ( apart from a field factor scale ) ; this confirms our finding of section iv that for lyngby - type annuli a transverse field is equivalent to an - in plane field applied in the direction of the current flow and at same time substantiate the presence of a current - parallel self - field ( otherwise the transverse pattern would not be skewed ) .",
    "the comparison of the transverse and in - plane mdps of sample b further supports this picture , if we recall that the effect of the current - parallel self - field is reduced , if not negligible , in oblate junctions .",
    "now the transverse critical field is larger for junction b ( @xmath361 ) , rather than junction a ( @xmath362 ) ; this was expected considering that a @xmath314 rotation of the in - plane field corresponds to a transformation @xmath363 . in other words , in presence of a transverse magnetic field , the system symmetry is broken along the direction of the current flow .",
    "this makes sample a about 32 times more sensitive to @xmath342 than to @xmath364 , the field conversion factor being about @xmath365 for junction b.      it was possible to trap josephson static vortices ( fluxons ) on a statistical basis by means of fast coolings of the samples through their superconducting transition .",
    "the trapping probability is know to grow with the speed of the normal - to - superconducting transition@xcite . after a successful trapping procedure",
    "the zero - voltage critical current is considerably smaller and a stable finite - voltage current branch , called zero - field step , appears in the junction current - voltage characteristic indicating that the bias current forces a single fluxon to travel along the ellipse perimeter in the absence of collisions .",
    "the corresponding flux quantum must be trapped in the superconducting loop formed by either the bottom or top electrode . for our samples",
    "the current branch associated with one fluxon had an amplitude larger than @xmath366 and an asymptotic voltage @xmath367 which results in an average speed , @xmath368 , considerably smaller than the swihart velocity , @xmath369 , typical of all-@xmath325 junctions evidencing , once again , indicating that the fluxon travels in the periodic potential@xcite generated by the bias current .",
    "the dynamic properties of eajtjs involves the nucleation , propagation and interaction of more than one fluxon or fluxon - antifluxon pair and will be discussed in a future work .",
    "the static properties of one - dimensional elliptic annular josephson tunnel junctions have been investigated theoretically and experimentally .",
    "both short and long junctions were considered in the presence of an in - plane as well as a transverse magnetic field . for short annular junctions we derived and computed the dependence of the critical current on a uniform in - plane magnetic field ; it is found that the @xmath72 vs. @xmath370 dependence is determined by the sample ellipticity , although the first critical field can only change by 50% .",
    "different geometrical configurations have been considered for studying the effect of a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the ellipse plane ; we established that for a lyngby - type eajtj a transverse field emulates an in - plane field applied along the direction of the current flow .",
    "further , we derived the proper perturbed sine - gordon equation to describe both the statics and the dynamics of the phase difference across the barrier of an eajtj .",
    "the static solutions of the partial differential equation were numerically computed and we found that , for a given field , different phase profiles are possible depending on the number of static fluxon - antifluxon pairs nucleated at the ellipse poles where the derivative of the normal field is largest .",
    "we also evaluated the static self - field effect in long eajtjs .",
    "two planar structures characterized by not simply - connected electrodes have been considered in the experiments .",
    "experimental data on high - quality long @xmath0-@xmath351-@xmath352 eajts basically confirm the numerical predictions , provided the effects of the current limiting static self - field are taken into account .",
    "a transverse magnetic field is demonstrated to be several times more efficient than an in - plane one to modulate the junction critical current . for a given inner area , prolate eajtjs (",
    "for which the inversion of the periodic potential occurs faster ) are more efficient for the in - plane to transverse field conversion .",
    "unbiased elliptic annular junctions inherently have specular symmetry with respect to their principal axes : quite obviously an in - plane magnetic field breaks the system symmetry along its direction . in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated that a transverse field breaks the symmetry along the direction of the current carrying leads ; furthermore , in long eajtjs the bias current itself also generates non - symmetric conditions , the asymmetry being more pronounced along the current direction for oblate ellipses and vice versa . among other things ,",
    "we have also suggested a simple geometrical configuration in which the magnetic field coupled to the elliptic barrier lacks reflection symmetry , so accomplishing a nearly ideal rectifying potential in which a soliton is accelerated only in one half of the junction perimeter .",
