    "ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ) are x - ray sources with very short orbital periods ( @xmath1 hr ) .",
    "they are thought to be powered by accretion from a roche - lobe ( rl ) filling donor star to a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "the donor has to be compact , such as the helium ( or more heavier elements ) core of an evolved giant star or a white dwarf ( wd ) , to fit in the small rl @xcite .",
    "spectra observations have shown possible c / o or he / n features in some of the ucxbs or ucxb candidates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "particular interests have been paid to ucxbs in recent years since they are thought to be potential sources for the gravitational - wave detector _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "scenarios for the formation of the ucxbs can be summarized as follows .",
    "for ucxbs in globular clusters , they often invoke dynamical processes , such as ( 1 ) direct collisions between a ns and a giant @xcite , ( 2 ) tidal capture of a low - mass main - sequence ( ms ) star by a ns @xcite , and ( 3 ) exchange interaction between a ns and a primordial binary @xcite .",
    "all these dynamical scenarios are involved with the so - called common - envelop ( ce ) phase when the mass transfer between a ns and a ( sub)giant is dynamically unstable , which may help form a tight ns@xmath2wd or ns@xmath2he star binary .",
    "after that , the orbital period decays to ultra - short regime through gravitational radiation ( gr ) until the wd / he star overflows its rl .",
    "for ucxbs in the galactic field where dynamical collisions are not important , generally two ce phases are required to form a tight ns@xmath2wd or ns@xmath2he star binary , which decays to the ultra - short regime through gr @xcite .",
    "an alternative formation channel of ucxbs is through stable mass transfer in normal low / intermediate - mass x - ray binaries ( l / imxbs ) driven by magnetic braking ( mb ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is now called the ",
    "magnetic capture \" scenario @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found that only a very small range of initial parameters are allowed for the binaries to evolve to ucxbs through this channel within the hubble time .",
    "this makes it impossible to account for the relatively large number of observed ucxbs .",
    "another problem of this scenario is related to the efficiency of mb .",
    "observations of some rapid rotators in young , open clusters seem to be contradicted with the mb law originally suggested by @xcite , and a modified magnetic braking law was proposed to resolve this problem @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that , if this new magnetic braking law is adopted , no ucxbs can be formed through the magnetic capture channel .",
    "in this paper we propose an alternative scenario for the formation of ucxbs through mass transfer between a ns and a ms star .",
    "we assume that during roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) , a small fraction of the mass lost from the donor forms a circum - binary ( cb ) disk around the binary rather accretes onto the ns @xcite .",
    "previous works have shown that a cb disk can extract orbital angular momentum from the binary effectively @xcite , and enhance the mass transfer rate , thus considerably influence the binary evolution @xcite . in this work",
    "we explore the possible role of cb disks in the formation of ucxbs . in ",
    "2 we introduce the binary evolution code and the input physics incorporated in our calculations . in ",
    "3 we present the calculated results and compare them with observations . the implications of our model and related uncertainties are discussed in  4 .",
    "we use the star programme , originally developed by @xcite and updated by other authors @xcite , to compute the binary evolution .",
    "the ratio of mixing length to pressure scale height @xmath3 is set to be 2.0 and convective overshooting parameter to be @xmath4 , implying a @xmath5 overshooting distance .",
    "the opacity table is taken from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "solar compositions ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) are adopted .",
    "the binary system is initially composed of a ns primary of mass @xmath9 and a zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) secondary of mass @xmath10 with an orbital period @xmath11 . the effective radius of the rl for the secondary star is calculated from @xcite equation , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass ratio of the binary components , and @xmath14 is the orbital separation .",
    "the rate of mass transfer via rlof is calculated with @xmath15m_{\\sun}$]yr@xmath16 in the code , where @xmath17 is the radius of the secondary , and we set @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the secondary star rotates synchronously with the binary orbital revolution , since the timescale of tidal synchronization is generally much shorter than the characteristic evolutionary timescale of the binaries considered here .",
    "we take into account four kinds of angular momentum loss mechanisms described as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) gravitational radiation , which becomes important when the orbital period is short .",
    "the angular momentum loss rate is given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the orbital angular momentum , gravitational constant and speed of light , respectively .",
    "\\(2 ) cb disk .",
    "we assume that a small fraction @xmath23 of the mass lost from the donor feeds into the cb disk rather leaves the binary , which yields a mass injection rate of the cb disk as @xmath24 .",
    "tidal torques are then exerted on the binary by the cb disk via gravitational interaction , thus extracting the angular momentum from the binary system .",
    "the angular momentum loss rate via the cb disk is estimated to be @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the inner radius of the cb disk ) , @xmath28 is the time since mass transfer begins . in the standard @xmath29-viscosity disk @xcite ,",
    "the viscous timescale @xmath30 at the inner edge @xmath27 of the cb disk is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath29 is the viscosity parameter ( we set @xmath32 in the following calculations ) , @xmath33 @xcite , and @xmath34 is the scale height of the disk . when @xmath35 is sufficiently large , the mass transfer will become dynamically unstable , so we add an ad hoc term @xmath36 to eq .",
    "( [ cb ] ) to suppress the cb disk - induced angular momentum loss rate when the mass loss rate is high .",
    "we find that this term does not influence the evolutionary tracks considerably , only expanding the parameter space of @xmath37 suitable for ucxb formation within the hubble time by @xmath38 . here",
    "the eddington accretion limit is expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy release efficiency through accretion ( @xmath41 the ns radius ) , and @xmath42 is the mass fraction of hydrogen in the accreting material .",
    "\\(3 ) mass loss .",
    "similar as in @xcite , we assume that the ns accretion rate is limited to the eddington accretion rate , and that when the mass transfer rate is less than @xmath43 , half of the mass is accreted by the ns , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "the excess mass is lost in the vicinity of the ns through isotropic winds , carrying away the specific angular momentum of the ns , i.e. @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the orbital radius of the ns , and @xmath47 is the orbital angular velocity of the binary .",
    "\\(4 ) magnetic braking .",
    "we use the saturated magnetic braking law suggested in @xcite , @xmath48 where @xmath49 g@xmath50s @xcite , @xmath51 is the critical angular velocity at which the angular momentum loss rate reaches a saturated state , and can be estimated as @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 hz , @xmath54 is the global turnover timescale for the convective envelope of the sun at its current age , @xmath55 for the secondary at age @xmath28 , solved by integrating the inverse local convective velocity over the entire surface convective envelope @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , an ad hoc factor is also added to eq .",
    "( [ eq : magneticbraking ] ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mass fraction of the surface convective envelope .",
    "this term is used to reduce the strength of mb when the star has a very small convective envelope and hence does not have a strong magnetic field .",
    "similar as in @xcite , we define ucxbs as x - ray binaries with @xmath60 min .",
    "the binary systems we considered are initially composed of a 1.4 @xmath61 ns and a @xmath62 zams star . we have performed calculations of a large number of binary evolutions , to search suitable values in the three dimensional binary parameter space @xmath37 ( assumed to be constant through one evolutionary sequence ) , @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath59 for binaries evolved to ucxbs within the age of the universe ( @xmath63 gyr ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath11 and @xmath64 for successful systems is shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] with @xmath65 d and @xmath66 .",
    "when the donor mass @xmath67 , the mass transfer becomes dynamically unstable ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . comparing with the results of @xcite one can find that there is a relatively large parameter space for the formation of ucxbs if there is a cb disk at work .      the possible distribution of @xmath37 and @xmath11 with @xmath68 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . to illustrate the effects of @xmath37 on the binary evolution , in figs .",
    "[ hr]@xmath69[f5 ] , we plot the exemplarily evolutionary tracks of the secondary in the h - r diagram , the evolution of the donor mass and period as a function of age respectively , for a binary system with @xmath70 , @xmath71 d and different values of @xmath37 .",
    "the lower limit of @xmath37 is determined by the constraint that age of the binary should be less than @xmath63 gyr : a larger value of @xmath37 leads to shorter formation time , as seen from fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ; if @xmath37 is too small , the binary will not be able to reach the @xmath72 min period within @xmath63 gyr due to inefficient angular momentum loss .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath37 is determined by two conditions .",
    "the first is that the minimum orbital period @xmath73 should be less than @xmath72 min . with larger values of @xmath37",
    ", the donor will spend relatively less time on the ms , leaving a smaller degenerate helium core . according to the mass - radius relation of degenerate stars , the smaller mass , the larger radius , which corresponds to a larger @xmath73 .",
    "the second is @xmath74 , because we find that mass transfer becomes unstable in most cases if @xmath75 .",
    "the formation and evolutionary paths of ucxbs depend on the adopted values of @xmath37 . in the case of @xmath76 and @xmath71 d , for example",
    ", when @xmath77 , the orbital period first decreases with mass transfer until the donor star loses its outer envelope and shrinks rapidly at @xmath78 d. this causes a cessation of mass transfer . in the subsequent evolution",
    "the orbital period may decrease down to the ultra - short regime under the effect of gr , until the secondary star fills its rl again , and the binary appears as a ucxb .",
    "when @xmath79 the binary evolves directly into the ultra - short regime with decreasing orbital period .",
    "we need to mention that the distribution of @xmath37 depends on the value of the viscous parameter @xmath29 , which we chose to be @xmath80 in our calculations as adopted in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude lower than the value ( @xmath81 ) inferred by @xcite for fully ionized , thin accretion disks from observations of dwarf nova outbursts and outbursts of x - ray transients .",
    "however , the @xmath29 value estimated by @xcite is an average one over the entire disk , while here it is at the inner edge of the disk @xcite , which may be smaller due to the boundary condition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . additionally ,",
    "since the cb disk is located outside the binary , and hence shielded from x - ray irradiation from the ns by the accretion disk around the ns and the secondary , the @xmath29 value in a cb disk might also be smaller than in accretion disks .",
    "taking account of the above facts , we suggest to regard fig .",
    "[ f2 ] as an optimistic case for the distribution of @xmath37 . nevertheless , from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) one can see that the cb disk - induced angular momentum loss rate is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "so if keeping @xmath82 constant , the binary evolution will be exactly the same ( this has been verified by our test calculations ) , implying a predictable @xmath37 distribution for a given value of @xmath29 .",
    "there are currently 10 ucxbs with known periods , 5 of which are persistent sources and 5 are transients .",
    "we list the orbital periods @xmath83 and mean mass accreting rates @xmath84 ( or the upper limit of @xmath84 ) of these ucxbs in table  1 .",
    "the @xmath84s listed in this table for persistent ucxbs are calculated by using the luminosities mentioned in the references and assuming accretion onto a @xmath85 ns with a @xmath86 km radius , while those for transient sources are from the estimates of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . to compare observations with our cb disk - assisted binary model",
    ", we plot the @xmath87 vs. @xmath83 relations in fig .",

    "we also indicate in figs .",
    "[ f6 ] and [ f7 ] whether the accretion disks in the lmxbs are thermally and viscously stable , according to the stability criterion for a mixed - composition ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) disk from @xcite.67 should be persistent according to the criterion , but it is transient in a different way : its outbursts do not last tens of days but tens of years @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath84 in table 1 is calculated from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) in @xcite assuming a distance of 3 kpc @xcite and the time between outbursts to be 30 years .",
    "if the recurrence time is as long as 1000 yrs , it will yield a much lower @xmath84 @xcite , and may help to resolve this transient / persistent problem .",
    "] we use the symbols @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath2 on the evolutionary tracks to denote where the hydrogen composition @xmath42 of the donor becomes 0.3 , 0.2 , and 0.1 , respectively , to show that the criterion of @xcite is applicable here .",
    "the positions of ucxbs are marked in these two figures with circles and triangles for persistent and transient sources , respectively .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a comparison between our cb disk - assisted binary models and the observations of ( compact ) ns lmxbs suggesting that it is possible to form ucxbs from normal lmxbs .",
    "we note that three of the ucxbs are in globular clusters , indicating low metallicities in these systems .",
    "however , from our calculations we find that change of metallicities does not significantly affect the binary evolution when the cb disk is involved",
    ". the 11-min ucxb 4u 1820@xmath6930 is particularly interesting because of its negative period derivative @xmath98 yr@xmath16 @xcite , which is inconsistent with the lower limit ( @xmath99 yr@xmath16 ) of the standard evolutionary scenario @xcite .",
    "while previous explanations for this negative period derivative invoke acceleration of the binary by a distant third companion in a hierarchical triple system , or by the cluster potential @xcite , our cb disk scenario may present an alternative interpretation of this negative period derivative ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "during rlof mass transfer , a cb disk may be formed as a result of mass outflow from the accretion disk , and has been invoked as an efficient process for the removal of orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "we propose a scenario for the formation of ucxbs from l / imxbs with the aid of a cb disk in this work .",
    "the suitable binary parameter space ( @xmath59 and @xmath11 ) with reasonable choice of the cb disk parameter @xmath37 for the formation of ucxbs within @xmath63 gyr is found to be significantly larger than in previous  magnetic capture \" model @xcite .",
    "this difference is caused by the fact that the bifurcation period is considerably increased if the cb disk is included . in l",
    "/ imxb evolution the bifurcation period @xmath100 is defined as the initial orbital period when the donor star is on zams , which separates the formation of converging systems from diverging systems . because the value of @xmath101 depends strongly on the angular momentum loss mechanisms @xcite",
    ", we would expect @xmath101 to be significantly changed when the cb disk is included in the binary model . in table  2",
    "we present the calculated values of @xmath101 for binary systems consisting of a @xmath102 ns and a @xmath103 secondary , with ( @xmath104 ) and without a cb disk .",
    "we also list the corresponding values of the period ( @xmath105 ) at which rlof begins @xcite . according to the investigation of @xcite and @xcite , binary systems with initial orbital period slightly below the bifurcation period",
    "can achieve the shortest possible orbital period .",
    "we list the shortest periods for binary systems with certain value of @xmath37 within @xmath63 gyr in table 2 , which clearly indicate that , ( 1 ) the larger @xmath37 , the larger @xmath101 and @xmath105 , and ( 2 ) ucxbs ( @xmath60 min ) are not likely to form in such a scenario without the aid of cb disks ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "we note here that when the binaries reach their minimum periods where the donors become degenerate , their orbital periods will bounce back into the period - increasing phase .",
    "our code can not follow the binary evolution with a degenerate donor star .",
    "it is likely that the observed ucxbs may be explained as binaries both evolving to shorter orbital periods with a hydrogen - deficient , non - degenerate donor star ( as presented in figs .  6 and 7 ) , and with a degenerate wd donor during a period - increasing phase @xcite .",
    "in addition , the helium - donor channel ( or semi - degenerate channel ) may also contribute to the formation of ucxbs @xcite .",
    "currently it is difficult to compare the ( spectral ) theoretical models for hydrogen - deficient accretion disks with observations , or directly measure the orbital period derivative , one possible criterion to discriminate ucxbs in the period - decreasing / increasing phases is related to the donor masses , which , together with the orbital periods , allow to determine the mass - radius relation of the donor .",
    "our calculations show that the ucxb s donor mass is around @xmath107 in the period - decreasing phase at @xmath108 mins , while in the period increasing phase , the donor mass should be around @xmath109 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previously investigations on the ucxbs xte j1807@xmath69294 @xcite , swift j1756.9@xmath692508 @xcite , and xte j0929@xmath69314 @xcite have shown that the donors should be wds unless the binary orbital inclination is very small ( @xmath110 ) , because of their small mass functions , while xte 1751@xmath69305 is more likely to be in the period - decreasing phase due to its relatively larger mass function @xcite .",
    "observationally there seem to be more systems in the period - increasing phase than in the period - decreasing phase .",
    "this may be addressed by the fact that ucxbs spend longer mass - transfer time in the former ( @xmath111 yr , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than in the latter phase ( @xmath112 yr , see * ? ? ?",
    "* and this wrok ) . from table  1",
    "there appears to be an apparent accumulation of systems with @xmath113 mins .",
    "the reason may lie in that ( 1 ) during the period - increasing phase , ucxbs spend more time at larger orbital periods ( see * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "9 ) , and ( 2 ) when @xmath114 mins , most of these systems become transient sources with very weak accretion ( @xmath115yr@xmath16 ) . from the calculation of @xcite ,",
    "these semi - degenerate systems should mainly distribute at @xmath116 mins @xmath117 mins ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  5 ) .",
    "most of them should be transients ( see * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) , among which the longer the orbital period , the weaker the accretion will be , thus the more difficult to be detected . these together account for the accumulation of ucxbs with @xmath113 mins . obviously a thorough population synthesis is needed to address the contribution to ucxbs from systems with non - degenerate , semi - degenerate and degenerate donors .    however , there exist some issues in the cb disk scenario , especially the existence of cb disk in lmxbs",
    ". @xcite suggest that cb disks are prospective to be observed in infrared and sub - millimeter band .",
    "although observations have shown evidence for the existence of cb disks in young binary systems @xcite , magnetic cataclysmic variables @xcite , and black hole lmxbs @xcite , more infrared observations are still needed to confirm or disprove the hypothesis that cb disk may exist in some lmxbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , the cb disk parameter @xmath37 is poorly known , and it is possible to change with time or mass transfer rate .",
    "the strong dependence of lmxb evolution on the value of @xmath37 prevents accurate estimation of the contribution of such binaries to ucxbs .",
    "more generally , we do not insist that there should be a cb disk in l / imxbs , but argue that a mechanism that mimics its features may be an important ingredient for understanding the overall period distribution of ucxbs as well as cataclysmic variable binaries @xcite .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of nearby elliptical galaxies have revealed a population of luminous point x - ray sources , which are likely to be lmxbs with accretion rates @xmath118 yr@xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these sources are explained either as transient lmxbs in which nss accreting from a red - giant star in wide orbits ( @xmath119 d ) @xcite or ultra - compact binaries ( @xmath120 min ) with a @xmath121 he or c / o donor @xcite .",
    "our calculations suggest that normal lmxbs with a cb disk may present a plausible alternative interpretation for these luminous x - ray sources .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] the mean lifetime spent by lmxbs evolved to ucxbs at certain luminosity with @xmath90 . here by the luminosity we mean the  potential maximum luminosity \" , where the eddington limit is removed and nearly all the mass lost by the donor is assumed to be accreted by the ns . from this figure",
    "we see that the ucxbs can be luminous ( @xmath122 ergs@xmath16 ) for @xmath123 yr , and the x - ray lifetime decreases sharply when @xmath124 ergs@xmath16 , which may account for the break in the luminosity function at @xmath125 ergs@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "a distinct feature of this explanation is that the luminous x - ray sources are predicted to be short - period , persistent rather transient sources .",
