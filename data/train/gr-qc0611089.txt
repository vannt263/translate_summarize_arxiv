    "this is so basically because the particles that compose a star have a huge charge to mass ratio , as is the case for a proton or an electron . for cold stars the electric charge is about @xmath0 coulombs per solar mass @xcite .",

    "in particular we are now interested in non stationary initial conditions to explore the fate of the gravitational collapse .",
    "the set problem has some physical and geometrical features that we review briefly , these are : anisotropy , dissipation and self  similarity .    for certain density ranges , local anisotropy in pressure can be physically justified in self  gravitating systems , since different kinds of physical phenomena may take place , giving rise to local anisotropy and in turn relaxing the upper limits imposed on the maximum value of the surface gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "the influence of local anisotropy in general relativity has been studied mostly under static conditions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "_ @xcite have reported a general study for spherically symmetric dissipative anisotropic fluids with emphasis on the relationship among the weyl tensor , the shear tensor , the anisotropy of the pressure and the density inhomogeneity . in another context , a scalar field with non  zero spatial gradient is an example of a physical system where the pressure is clearly anisotropic .",
    "boson stars , hypothetical self - gravitating compact objects resulting from the coupling of a complex scalar field to gravity , are systems where anisotropic pressure occurs naturally .",
    "similarly , the energy  momentum tensor of both electromagnetic and fermionic fields are anisotropic @xcite .",
    "we want to stress that in order to have isotropy we need an extra assumption on the behavior of the fields or on the fluid describing interiors .",

    "we also discuss the junction conditions to match the dissipative interior space  time with the exterior space  time , a reissner ",

    "section [ selfsimilar ] contains a review of self  similarity for the sake of completeness",

    "let us consider a non static distribution of matter which is spherically symmetric and consists of charged fluid of energy density @xmath2 , pressure @xmath3 , electric energy density @xmath4 and radiation energy flux @xmath5 diffusing in the radial direction , as measured by a local minkowskian observer comoving with the fluid ( with velocity @xmath6 )",
    ". in radiation coordinates @xcite the metric takes the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are functions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . as it is well known for the spherical symmetry @xmath12 are the only non vanishing electromagnetic field tensor components .",
    "now , defining the function @xmath13 by the relation @xmath14 the inhomogeneous maxwell equations become @xmath15 and @xmath16 where the comma subscript represents partial derivative with respect to the indicated coordinate ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the temporal and radial components of the electric current four vector , respectively . thus",
    ", the function @xmath13 is naturally interpreted as the charge within the radius @xmath11 at the time @xmath10 . thus , the inhomogeneous maxwell field equations entail the conservation of charge @xmath19 where the four  velocity is given by @xmath20.\\ ] ] we can write the conservation equation in a more suitable form , that is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the matter velocity .",
    "it is clear that inside a sphere comoving with the fluid the charge is conserved .    introducing the mass function by means of @xmath23 we can write the einstein field equations as follows @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the electric energy density @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the local electric field intensity .",
    "observe that we have introduced the mass function @xmath35 instead the usual total mass @xmath36 .",
    "if we define the degree of local anisotropy induced by charge as @xmath37 , the electric charge determines such a degree at any point .",
    "it can be shown that the tolman ",
    "volkoff equation reduces to @xmath38 -e^{-2\\beta}\\bigg(\\frac{\\bar\\rho+\\bar p}{1 - 2\\mu / r}\\bigg)_{,u}=\\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{2}{r } \\bigg(p_t-\\bar p\\bigg ) .",
    "\\label{eq : tov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this generalized equation is the same as for an anisotropic fluid @xcite .    the most general junction conditions for our system can be written as @xcite @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 where a subscript @xmath42 indicates that the quantity is evaluated at the surface , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the total mass and the total charge , respectively .",
    "remarkably , the last equation is equivalent to @xmath45    we have obtained a system of equations which are equivalent to the anisotropic matter case ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the next section we will see how this approach lead us to an extra simplification .",
    "up to this point all the written equations are general .",
    "we can try to solve the system using numerical techniques or a seminumerical approach to gain some insight .",
    "the last method is worked out in the next section .",
    "we shall assume that the spherical distribution admits a one  parameter group of homothetic motion .",
    "a homothetic vector field on the manifold is one that satisfies @xmath462@xmath47 on a local chart , where @xmath48 is a constant on the manifold and @xmath49 denotes the lie derivative operator . if @xmath50 we have a proper homothetic vector field and it can always be scaled so as to have @xmath51 ; if @xmath52 then @xmath53 is a killing vector on the manifold .",
    "so , for a constant rescaling , @xmath53 satisfies @xmath54 and has the form @xmath55 the homothetic equations reduce to @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are solutions if the self  similar variable is defined as @xmath64 we have reported @xcite a simple homothetic solution which can be written for the present case as @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 constants .",
    "it can be shown that for a given @xmath67 , @xmath68 must be a root of a complicated seventh degree polynomial in order to satisfy the additional symmetry equations .",
    "it is obvious that these solutions satisfy the continuity of the first fundamental form , and to satisfy the continuity of the second fundamental form , the radial velocity at the surface must be @xmath69      now , to completely determine the metric we have two differential equations at the surface , the equation ( [ eq : drdu ] ) and the field equation ( [ eq : one ] ) which evaluated at the surface become respectively @xmath70 and @xmath71 where a dot over a variable denotes the derivative with respect to time .",
    "the quantity @xmath72 is defined as @xmath73 and can be explicitly determined using equation ( [ eq : tov ] ) evaluated at the surface , resulting in @xmath74 - 2(c_t / a)^2 \\nonumber \\\\ -k(k+1 + 3(l+1))\\ }   \\{k+1-(1 - 2\\mu_a / a)(k+l+2)-(c_t / a)^2\\}/ \\nonumber \\\\ \\left[4(1 - 2\\mu_a / a)(l+1)a^2\\right].\\label{q+}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the surface equations ( [ ap ] ) and ( [ mup ] ) together with equations ( [ omega ] ) and ( [ q+ ] ) can be integrated numerically ( using runge ",
    "kutta for instance ) for initial conditions @xmath75 and @xmath76 and some @xmath67 and @xmath44 .",
    "the only restrictions on these conditions and parameters come from the need to get a physically acceptable model .    for @xmath77 ( which implies @xmath78 ) we obtain the same results of reference @xcite",
    ". as we have mention before , we gain some simplification with the anisotropic approach of this paper , that is , one of the similarity equations ( eq .",
    "( 23 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) was decoupled , leading us to less restrictive models .",
    "once the surface equations are integrated we have to integrate the conservation equation ( [ ce ] ) to obtain all the physical variables inside the source . to do that we use comoving spatial markers @xmath79 .",
    "thus the conservation equation can be written as @xmath80 which is a wave  like equation that can be integrated numerically using the lax method ( with the appropriate courant ",
    " levy ( cfl ) condition ) .",
    "the evolution of the conservation equation is restricted by the surface evolution and was implemented as follows @xmath81 the superscript @xmath48 indicates the hypersurface @xmath82 and the subscript @xmath83 the spatial position for a comoving observer at @xmath84 .",
    "we typically used @xmath85 with a cfl condition @xmath86 . in order to integrate the conservation equation we need to specify a boundary condition and an initial condition . for this work we have used the boundary condition @xmath87 with an initial condition @xmath88 where the power @xmath89 allows us to test the sensitivity to the initial conditions of our results",
    "as a test of our approach to dealing with electric charge as anisotropy is to reproduce the results reported in @xcite . for this scenario @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "even when the initial mass @xmath95 is not equal to one , we obtain the same results , that is , the collapse is halted and the boundary oscillates when the total electric charge asymptotically approximates the total mass @xmath96 and the radius equals asymptotically to twice the total electric charge .",
    "the ratio @xmath97 as a function of time is the same for any region . also , as the distribution evolves , becomes dust asymptotically with damped oscillations and the pressure at the surface coincides with the heat flow .",
    "the matter velocity profiles at all regions have damped oscillations that evolve to the static regime .",
    "a striking result not reported before is the ability to obtain any interior profile for matter velocity or electric charge function using the simple rule @xmath98 where @xmath99 could be either @xmath100 or @xmath101 , that is , once the surface profile is determined we can go without additional work inside the distribution .",
    "another interesting result is that we can get the interior profiles for pressure and energy density by @xmath102 where @xmath103 could be @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "now that we have successfully tested our new approach , we explore another physical scenario , one with redistribution of the electric charge . for this case",
    "we choose @xmath104 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath94 to obtain ( among other roots ) @xmath105 . for @xmath106 ( power of the initial condition to integrate the conservation equation ) the results",
    "are shown in figures [ one][six ] .",
    "the system collapses and losses mass until it reaches a stable oscillatory state .",
    "when the distribution is in oscillatory regime the mass behaves in the same way , that is , oscillates between two extremal values .",
    "this oscillatory behavior extends to all physical variables at all pieces of the material .",
    "the interior redistribution of electric charge responds to the surface dynamics .",
    "electric charge ( repulsively ) let the distribution expand with absorption of energy up to some maximum point in which gravitation compensates electric repulsion .",
    "therefore the collapse undergoes with emission of energy , up to some minimum point in which electric repulsion is again dominant and so on indefinitely .",
    "this model seems to be independent of the initial conditions , as shown in figure [ seven ] .",
    "the dependence of the radius on the total electric charge is shown in figure [ eight ] .",
    "analysis of this last result indicates scale invariance with respect to the total electric charge .",
    "in fact , once the stationary state ( oscillatory ) is reached , the amplitude and period depend on the total electric charge . thus ,",
    "if we know the oscillatory regime for some specific value of electric charge , we can reproduce the oscillatory regime for any other , non zero , value of electric charge . in the limit of zero charge",
    "the distribution shrink completely , forming a very small region with very high energy density and pressure .",
    "this last result was found in another context ( see section iv .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the energetic at the boundary surface in conjunction with the pull of gravity and push of electric charge , explain the dependence between the amplitude and period with the total electric charge .",
    "these features are analogous to the reported by brady _",
    "@xcite for a real and massive scalar field . in this context",
    "the mass destroys the scale invariance of the einstein ",
    "scalar field equations , but after the nearly critical phase the oscillation period depends on the inverse of scalar field mass , i.e. the compton wavelength . in our case",
    "the situation is analogous respect to the electric total charge .",
    "parenthetically , the seidel  suen oscillaton @xcite is the stable solution far from the critical behavior of a massive and real scalar field .",
    "our solution behaves like that stable configuration from quite simple considerations .",
    "in this paper we have shown that electrically charged matter can be considered as anisotropic matter .",
    "we exemplify the approach obtaining a dynamical model under the diffusion approximation and self  similarity within the source .",
    "the showed example is representative of many others varying only the initial conditions , @xmath67 and @xmath44 , and imposing the following physical conditions : @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "some general considerations concerning our results are listed next ,    * extremely compact distribution : the collapse is halted when the total electric charge is about the total mass ( in geometrical units ) .",
    "if the initial radius of the electrically charged distribution is @xmath110 , the radius of the final stable source is @xmath111 .",
    "also the final pressure ( if not zero ) is about @xmath112 and the energy density @xmath113 . * high electric field : the electric charge used in our models can be as high as @xmath114 . thus , the electric field for the stable configuration is about @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "the sign of net charge does not affect our results . *",
    "high powered : if the initial total mass is @xmath116 the final is @xmath117 , that is , almost @xmath118 of the the mass is radiated in @xmath119",
    ".    a more general solutions to the homothetic equations ( [ se1 ] ) and ( [ se2 ] ) could be necessary to explore how general our results are .",
    "however , the results found using the anisotropic approach are consistent with previously reported results when the static regime is the final state @xcite@xcite . if the solution reaches stationarity it oscillates . for this case we did not investigate the stability of the system , but independence of initial conditions is apparent .",
    "it is clear that the presence of some finite electric charge ( or anisotropy ) avoids singularity formation .",
    "finally , we would like to conclude by posing a question .",
    "if the spherically symmetric source has an upper limit for the total net electric charge that carries @xcite , is it relaxed by the transport mechanism or by the additional homothetic symmetry ?",
