    "the observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters unambiguously show that we live in a magnetized universe .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields with coherence length @xmath1 and intensities @xmath2 have been observed in all gravitationally bound large - scale structures . however , whether these magnetic fields have a primordial origin or were generated during the period of galaxy formation is still an open question ( for a full discussion see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . understanding this point is a major goal of modern astrophysics and cosmology , and for this purpose",
    "it is extremely important to consider all the phenomena which leave a different _ signature _ on magnetic fields of different origin .",
    "as we are going to show below , one of these phenomena is the interaction of the magnetic field with a cosmic axion field .",
    "we will show in particular that the primordial axion oscillations generate a helical component of the magnetic field .",
    "of course , this effect regards only magnetic fields of primordial origin , since it takes place in the very short interval of time when axions start to oscillate .",
    "this happens when the temperature of the universe is about @xmath3 , much before the galaxy formation .",
    "in other words , if we believe in the existence of axions then any _ primordial _ magnetic field observed today must be ( at least partially ) _",
    "helical_.    the magnetic helicity is a very peculiar quantity associated with a magnetic field @xcite , and speculations about the generation of primordial helical magnetic fields exist in the literature @xcite . in general , given an electromagnetic field @xmath4 we define the magnetic helicity as @xmath5 which can be considered as a chern - simons term because of the relation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor , @xmath8 its dual , @xmath9 being the determinant of the metric tensor and @xmath10 the levi - civita ( pseudo-)tensor .",
    "the definition of the helicity given above is valid in the minkowski as well as in the expanding freedman - robertson - walker universe , since it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is invariant under general coordinate transformations . on the other hand",
    ", it is odd under discrete @xmath11 and @xmath12 transformations ( it is a pseudo - scalar quantity ) .",
    "this leads to the well known result that the presence of magnetic helicity in our universe is a manifestation of a macroscopic @xmath11 and @xmath12 violation .",
    "of course , the phenomenon we are investigating crucially depends on the existence of the axion field .",
    "this is related to the so - called peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism @xcite for the explanation of the smallness ( or absence ) of the @xmath13violating part of the qcd lagrangian . after almost 30 years",
    ", this is still the most trusted argument for the solution of the above problem , known as the strong@xmath14 problem ( for a general review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this explains why the existence of the axion is largely believed , even without any experimental evidence for it , and justifies the great interest in its phenomenology .",
    "axions are chargeless , weakly interacting , pseudo - scalar particles which emerge as ( pseudo-)goldstone modes of the ( almost ) conserved pq symmetry @xmath15 .",
    "although chargeless , axions interact with photons by means of the anomalous term @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant , and @xmath19 is the scale at which @xmath15 is spontaneously broken , known as the axion or pq constant .",
    "this scale characterizes all the axion properties on the phenomenological ground .",
    "even though its value is not predicted by the pq mechanism , and thus is model dependent , it is constrained to the very narrow allowed window @xmath20 by astrophysical and cosmological observations and considerations @xcite .",
    "this is a remarkable point since it will make all our results essentially independent on the specific axion model .",
    "it is quite interesting ( and even rather surprising ) that the axion field , introduced to solve the strong@xmath14 problem in the qcd lagrangian , generates a helical component of the primordial magnetic field , contributing to the macroscopic @xmath13violation in the universe .",
    "this point can be more easily understood considering the cosmological evolution of the axion field .",
    "axions are born when the universe is at the temperature @xmath21 , and @xmath15 spontaneously breaks . after the universe has cooled down enough for the axion mass to be comparable with the hubble expansion rate @xmath22 , axions start to oscillate driving the qcd lagrangian to its @xmath13conserving minimum . during that time axions",
    "constitute a @xmath23 momentum condensate , weakly interacting with the external magnetic field .",
    "the main effect of this external field is to `` extract '' axions from the condensate .",
    "this process is governed by the simple eq .",
    "( [ eq26b ] ) , where @xmath24 is the number of axions per co - moving volume and @xmath25 is a positive , time dependent function , proportional to the magnetic energy , and inversely proportional to the conductivity of the primordial plasma . for vanishing magnetic fields ,",
    "the number of axion per co - moving volume remains constant during the time of coherent oscillations .",
    "this is a well known result ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) which leads to the upper limit on the pq constant ( the so - called cosmological bound @xcite ) .",
    "we will see later that this bond remains essentially unchanged even in the very strong field limit , owing to the smallness of @xmath25 .    however , the effect of the axion primordial oscillations on the magnetic field is more interesting .",
    "in fact , the evaporation of axions from the condensate is followed by the productions of photons and a resulting increment of the magnetic field strength .",
    "since the probabilities of creating left - handed and right - handed photons are different ( @xmath12 is not exact ) , the final result is an overproduction of photons of one kind with respect to the other . in other words , the helicity of the system changes .",
    "more specifically , the axion coherent oscillations play the role of an @xmath26dynamo on the evolution of the magnetic field because of the term @xmath27 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) ] , where @xmath28 is proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "this term is @xmath11 and @xmath12 odd , and is responsible for the generation of the magnetic helicity .",
    "as we expect from the above discussion , for this case the dynamo is not efficient ( @xmath28 is small ) , owing mainly to the smallness of the axion - photon coupling @xmath29 and to the large value of the primordial conductivity @xmath30 .",
    "this last point reflects the known result that helicity is conserved when the conductivity is infinitively large .",
    "the interaction between pseudo - scalar and electromagnetic fields has been the object of various papers in the literature .",
    "+ in the seminal paper by turner and widrow @xcite , it was suggested that , during the inflationary epoch , small fluctuating magnetic fields could have been amplified due to the coupling with the axion field . this possibility was exhaustively studied in the subsequent papers by garretson et al .",

    "+ ahonen et al .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of the cosmic axion field in the background of an external homogeneous magnetic field just after the qcd phase transition , while in a recent paper , lee et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the possibility of generating magnetic fields through the coupling of an evolving pseudo - scalar field during the period of the large scale structures formation .    in the next section",
    "we will study more accurately the mechanism of helicity generation by primordial axion oscillations before the qcd phase transition .",
    "we start with the following interaction lagrangian between the cosmic axion field @xmath31 and the electromagnetic field @xmath32 in curved space - time @xmath33 where the external current @xmath34 takes into account the interaction between the cosmic plasma and the primordial magnetic field ( see below ) .",
    "physics becomes more clear if we introduce the electric and magnetic fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in a flat universe described by a robertson - walker metric , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the expansion parameter normalized so that at the present time @xmath39 , @xmath40",

    "for very high intensities of the magnetic field , that is above the critical value @xmath58 ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the mass and absolute value of the electric charge of the electron ) , the expression for the conductivity needs to be multiplied by @xmath61 @xcite .    introducing the `` angle '' @xmath62 , the hubble parameter @xmath63 , and neglecting any spatial variation of @xmath31 , from lagrangian ( [ eq2 ] ) we get the equations of motion @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the ohmic current , @xmath66 is the displacement current in the expanding universe , and we have introduced the current @xmath67 .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) dominates the other two ) then the magnetic field is exponentially amplified , while if the dynamo is not efficient ( and neglecting any dissipative effect ) the magnetic field is frozen into the plasma .",

    "a simple consequence is that the cosmological bound on the axion mass is preserved , even in the presence of a very strong external magnetic field .",

    "<S> the coupling between a primordial magnetic field and the cosmic axion field generates a helical component of the magnetic field around the time in which the axion starts to oscillate . if the energy density of the seed magnetic field is comparable to the energy density of the universe at that time , then the resulting magnetic helicity is about @xmath0 and remains constant after its generation . as a corollary </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the standard properties of the oscillating axion remain unchanged even in the presence of very strong magnetic fields . </S>"
