    "the role of dust in galaxies at present and at earlier epochs is still highly controversial .",
    "recent dust models have attempted to understand the evolutionary cycle of dust ( edmunds 2001 ( hereafter e01 ) ; dwek 1998 ( hereafter dwek98 ) ; tielens 1998 ) but there can be no real advancement whilst there still exists inherent uncertainties over dust sources , composition , destruction and the dependence of dust production on metallicity evolution .",
    "it is well known that dust production in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is too slow ( timescales for dust growth are smaller than destructive timescales ( tielens 1998 ) ) so formation sites during stellar evolution are required to explain the vast amounts of dust we observe in the universe .",
    "it is generally accepted that dust is formed in the atmospheres of evolved stars and ejected via stellar winds with mass loss rates of up to @xmath1 ( gehrz 1989 ; whittet 1992 ) and contribute up to @xmath2 of dust to the ism in our galaxy per year ( bode 1988 ) .",
    "others however , propose that supernovae explosions must be an important contributor to dust formation ( dwek & scalo 1980 , todini & ferrara 2001 ( hereafter tf01 ) ) to account for the dust observed at high redshifts ( as seen in damped lyman alpha systems and in scuba data ( frayer & scoville 1999 ) ) . the lack of significant xmm detection of scuba sources in a deep field ( waskett et al , 2003 ) imply these sources are probably not agn and even if they were , then they are likely to be heavily obscured and at high redshifts ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "almaini et al ( 1999 ) also show no significant chandra detections of other sub - mm fields .",
    "if not agn then they are probably extremely dusty starburst galaxies , implying that dust is already present in the high redshift universe .",
    "it is difficult for the dust to have originated from low - mass evolved stars at redshifts @xmath4 as their evolutionary timescales ( @xmath5 - @xmath6yrs ) are comparable to the age of the universe at that time .",
    "so it is argued then that if dust _ is _ present in the early universe , then type ii sne are responsible .",
    "however , some estimates of the contribution of sne dust mass to the current ism show an injection of only @xmath7 per year ( bode 1988 ; gehrz 1989 ) , and a recent study of the infrared emission from three supernova remnants ( snr ) has shown no evidence of dust formation in sn ejecta - in fact , it was found the emission was probably circumstellar in origin ( douvion et al 2001a ) .",
    "+   + even dust production in stars has its own complications .",
    "depending on the star s composition ( whether it is carbon rich ( c stars ) or oxygen rich ( m stars ) and what fraction of a stellar population is in these stars , there will be a difference in the returned fraction of carbon and silicate type grains to the ism .",
    "the problem compounds when o rich stars may become c rich as they ascend the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) whilst undergoing pulsations ( marigo et al 1996 ) .",
    "iras observations ( molster et al 2001 ) and observations of agb stars in the large magellanic cloud ( trams et al 1999 ) show a high degree of silicate dust in c stars and it is yet unclear whether this is due to silicate formation in a previously o rich star or due to an o rich binary companion ( molster et al 2001 ) .",
    "+   + the questions posed and discussed here are then : when are the conditions for dust formation reached in stars ? what is the source of dust at high redshift and is dust production dependent on metallicity ? how much dust is present in these early galaxies and",
    "how will this affect observations ?",
    "the aim of this paper is to ask whether or not we can build up a significant amount of dust in high redshift galaxies using the available literature and models .    in section  [ sec : star ]",
    "we use published stellar atmosphere and evolution models to determine when dust may form in stars .",
    "we then estimate the efficiency of dust formation in stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] presents the well established chemical evolution equations and their applications for following dust evolution in a galaxy . in section  [ sec : early ] we attempt to understand the source of dust in early galaxies , using the modified elementary model from e01 .",
    "we incorporate the finite lifetime of stars into the dust model and compare this with evolutionary timescales to determine the maximum redshift after which dust can be observed in the universe for different star formation rates and cosmological parameters .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] gives the conclusions obtained in this report and an outline of future work .",
    "the majority of work has assumed that the formation of solids from a gas in stars can be described using classical nucleation theory .",
    "condensation of a species x occurs when its partial pressure in the gas exceeds its vapour pressure in condensed phase ( whittet 1992 ) , with subsequent particle growth by random encounters leading to cluster formation .",
    "chemical reactions will further assist cluster production ( salpeter 1974 ) .",
    "the rate of grain growth will therefore depend on the temperature , @xmath8 and pressure , @xmath9 of the gas and the condensation temperature of a species , @xmath10 .",
    "the optimum conditions for nucleation are thought to occur in the range @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( salpeter 1974 ; yorke 1988 ) .",
    "this gives very strict restrictions on where nucleation can occur and this is thought to be satisfied in giant atmospheres at certain stages of evolution .",
    "the type of dust formed will depend on the relative abundance of carbon or oxygen with carbon dust able to form in temperatures @xmath13 . for silicates to form via condensation",
    "we require temperatures below @xmath14 ( bode 1987 ; whittet 1992 ; salpeter 1974 ) .",
    "these conditions represent the boundary nucleation in figures  [ atmosa ] and ( b ) .",
    "unfortunately there is not yet nearly enough hard observational evidence to follow through the whole process of dust formation in stars so , in an attempt to investigate when nucleation conditions are reached in stars , we examine extended atmosphere models for k and m giants ( plez et al 1992a & 1992b ; hauschildt et al 1999b ; brown et al 1993 ) .",
    "we use these models to estimate the temperature and pressure in the gas out to a stellar radius where the continuum optical depth at 500 nm has fallen to @xmath15 .",
    "the atmospheric conditions depend on the mass of the star , @xmath16 , its surface gravity ( @xmath17 ) , and its effective temperature at the surface , @xmath18 .",
    "the published models assume spherical geometry with homogeneous stationary layers in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and use numerical codes to simulate the gas properties in stellar atmospheres ( e.g. ( hauschildt et al 1999a ) with these models available from the website : http://phoenix.physast.uga.edu/ng-giant ) .",
    "although this is probably not a realistic description of conditions in stellar atmospheres where pulsations , mass loss and inhomogeneities will surely exist , they will serve to make an estimate of the mean condition for the processes occuring .",
    "model atmospheres for c stars were obtained from jrgensen et al ( 1992 ) and an observational model ( harper et al 2001 ) of the red giant alphaori is included for comparison ( with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "the model @xmath22-@xmath23 curves are shown in figure  [ atmosb ] for @xmath24 , and figure  [ atmosa ] for @xmath25 .",
    "they clearly show the models do not extend to the low gas temperatures observed in alphaori , and we will assume the boundaries do in fact extend downwards in a similar manner .",
    "it is also clear that as @xmath18 increases , the likelihood of the gas temperatures reaching the nucleation boundary decreases .",
    "the figures in hauschildt et al ( 1999b ) show for various values of @xmath26 , that only those atmospheres with @xmath27 will reach gas temperatures below 2000k and hence attain c nucleation conditions .",
    "in order to reach the silicate nucleation boundary , we require @xmath28 ( fig  [ atmosc ] ) .    to determine to which stars these model atmospheres apply , the luminosity was calculated using equation  [ lum ] and simply placed on a herstzprung - russell diagram using their respective @xmath18 values ( fig  [ hrstars ] ) .",
    "@xmath29    the stars do indeed correspond to the evolved stages expected , but for dust nucleation properties to be reached we require the stars to lie on or just beyond a late agb phase ( evolutionary tracks of solar metallicity , @xmath30 , from schaller et al ( 1992 ) ) .",
    "it appears then that the stars seen to produce dust using the arguments given here , only satisfy the conditions at the very latest stages of their evolution which is only a very small fraction of their life ( @xmath31years ) .",
    "this phase is the tpagb ( thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ) as described further in section  [ tpagb ] .",
    "the stellar evolution models from the the padova group ( http://pleiadi.pd.astro.it ) also give the same conclusion .",
    "the stellar tracks can reach lower effective temperatures ( pols et al 1995 ) depending on the opacitites , overshooting and mixing parameters used although a recent study of these models suggest there is still more to be done in this area ( young et al 2001 ) .",
    "we await further progress on new tracks given by this group using their new stellar evolution code , .    in further sections we assume that only those stars with @xmath32 and which lie on this evolutionary branch are significant producers of dust ( although this is actually a maximum limit since these are the conditions for carbon nucleation and we would expect to require much lower temperatures for the formation of silicate dust ) .",
    "it is important to note that because of this reasoning we have ignored dust production in the atmospheres of stars with @xmath33 .",
    "observationally however , dust shells are seen around a class of massive stars which suffer large mass loss ( @xmath34 ) in the late stages of their evolution .",
    "these are the wolf - rayet stars , which have three phases characterised by the dominant species of o , c and n in their spectra .",
    "dust shells are only seen around the very cool , carbon rich wr ( dwek98 ) , and will therefore contribute to the production of carbon dust in the ism .",
    "could this be a significant dust formation site ?",
    "recent observations of a wr binary system have shown that the formation of dust in these stars may be increased via wind - wind interactions with at least 20 per cent escaping and thus enriching the ism ( marchenko et al 2002 ) .",
    "their results find a total dust mass of @xmath35 which coupled with the mass loss rate gives an estimate of the condensation efficiency of dust in wr of @xmath36 per cent .",
    "but wr stars are also very rare in galaxies as compared to low - intermediate mass stars , with the fraction of stars in a given population with @xmath37 @xmath38 implying that the yield of dust from such a process will not be significant .",
    "the dominant processes in stellar mass loss are pulsational and line driven winds with mass loss rates of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the important question to ask is how much of these outflows are in the form of _ condensed _ material ? whether or not dust is formed from the gas will depend on the temperature and the density inside the wind ( section  [ nuc ] ) .",
    "a rough estimate of the dust production in these winds can be made by investigating condensation conditions in stellar atmosphere models which in turn are tied to stellar evolutionary models which predict @xmath18 and @xmath41 throughout the stars evolution .",
    "the mass lost throughout the star s lifetime must satisfy the initial - final mass relationship shown in weidermann ( 1987 ) and marigo ( 2000 ) .",
    "thus for low - intermediate mass stars @xmath42 , the mass lost in stellar winds and novae is the difference between the initial mass , @xmath43 and the final remnant mass , @xmath44 . for high mass stars ( @xmath45 ) the mass is lost via both winds and sne .",
    "stars with mass beyond @xmath46 may become a black hole and swallow up the elements produced ( maeder 1992 ) so they are ignored here .",
    "we have followed the evolutionary model grids in schaller et al ( 1992 ) , up to the end of central c burning for high mass stars , the early agb phase for intermediate stars and up to the he flash for low mass stars .",
    "some of the mass lost during a stars lifetime must occur during a very late agb phase or after ( the mass lost from the published models does not explain the difference between the initial mass and remnant mass . in the tpagb & stellar wind phases ,",
    "@xmath41 & @xmath47 were taken from blcker ( 1995a ) and marigo ( 1996 ) , but how and where does this occur ? as a star ascends the agb its thought that ( depending on the previous mass loss history ) , it may undergo some he flashes and will pulsate periodically .",
    "this is the tpagb phase and will create a dredge up of material within the star to its surface .",
    "there will be not only a change in the composition in the atmosphere but also the composition of the dust ( garcia - lario & pera calderon 2001 ; herwig et al 1999 ) .",
    "the tpagb phase has mass loss rates comparable to the agb phase and lasts for approximately @xmath31years depending on the initial stellar mass ( 7 - 3@xmath48 respectively ) and the number of thermal pulses in the phase ( blcker 1995a ) .",
    "so there is an opportunity here to create and inject dust into the ism , but are the conditions right ?",
    "the conditions for dust formation do appear to be satisfied in the tpagb phase as shown in figure  [ tpphase ] where the evolutionary tracks of stars undergoing thermal pulses from marigo ( 1996 ) are added to those in schaller et al ( 1992 ) for low - intermediate mass stars .",
    "it may be seen that the tpagb tracks pass through the area where dust forming atmopsheres exist on figure  [ hrstars ] .",
    "the pulses may allow for periodic dust formation by increasing the density around the condensation point ( blcker 1995b ) and carbon stars evolving on these tracks can reach @xmath49 ( marigo 1996 ) , increasing the likelihood of nucleation .",
    "the future evolution of the star may depend on where the thermal pulses occur as they ascend the agb .",
    "if the tp occurs just before the agb ends , the star will experience dredge up and may become c rich .",
    "a superwind is then thought to occur with @xmath50 ( schonberner & steffan 2001 ; blcker 1995b ) .",
    "if the tp occurs after the agb ends ( characterised by an increase in @xmath18 and a decrease in @xmath41 ( fujii et al 2001 ) ) , then it will evolve on a constant luminosity track for @xmath51years to a planetary nebula stage ( pn ) - and the star is now pagb ( post agb ) .",
    "this is characterised by an increasing @xmath52 and a decreased mass loss with temperatures reaching above 30,000k .",
    "the central star begins to ionize the surrounding material to create a ppn ( proto - planetary nebula ) .",
    "this phase does not seem suitable for dust formation .",
    "it does not satisfy the low temperatures or the high mass loss rates needed , so we can ignore this as a significant phase of dust production ( although circumstellar dust shells are seen around pagb stars , they are thought to have survived from their previous agb phase ( lorenz - martins et al 2001 ) .",
    "if the tp occurs when he burning has ceased then the star will evolve on a white dwarf cooling track and will again not be suitable for dust conditions .",
    "so in these later evolutionary stages we have a clear candidate for a dust formation site - stars in the tpagb and the superwind phases .",
    "those stars which have had their composition changed from o rich to c rich are now more likely to form c rich dust .",
    "it is interesting to note that from section  [ nuc ] , not only is it difficult to reach the low temperatures in stars for silicates to form but we are now faced with the problem that those o rich stars are likely to become c rich in the most significant dust formation stages ! this would infer that silicate dust may not be the dominant component of returned dust from stars as previously thought ( bode 1988 ) , but instead sne may be responsible for most of the silicate dust we see in the ism .",
    "dust formation in the tpagb phase will also be highly dependant on metallicity as dredge ups are more efficient at low z , hence the tpagb is reached earlier on in the stars lifetime and more c stars are formed ( dwek98 ; groenewegen 1999 ; marigo 1998 ; marigo et al 1999 ) .",
    "the enhanced conversion of o stars to c stars at low z may then imply a large abundance of carbon dust in the early universe ( although at z=0.001 we need at least @xmath53yrs for @xmath54 to reach the tpagb phase ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if it is mainly carbon dust forming in stars during the tpagb phase then it may be formed from freshly synthesised elements in the star and may be considered differently to dust formed from pre - existing heavy elements in stellar atmospheres .",
    "this may have consequences in models which separate the formation of dust into two different modes .",
    "from e01 , we can define a dust formation efficiency ( i.e. how much of the available heavy elements will be incorporated into dust ) depending on whether those heavy elements are from freshly synthesised ( e.g. in sne ) or pre - exisitng material ( e.g. in stellar winds ) .",
    "we label these dust condensation efficiencies @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "the tpagb phase may thus be considered as a @xmath55 source instead of a @xmath56 as although the dust is being formed in a stellar wind , its source of heavy elements is dredged up from freshly synthesised carbon from the core . although the ejecta is likely to be mixed , the carbon dredged up during the tp - agb phase is a way of producing fresh elements at low metallicity , i.e. the production of both silicate and carbon dust may depend on metallicity .",
    "the implications of this is investigated in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the mass - radius relation , @xmath57 hence @xmath58    now to answer the first question posed earlier - what is the mean optical depth through the galaxy ?",
    "the answer is obvious , since the mass of dust remains the same , but it is instructive to follow a simple binomial distribution argument . if the n clouds each have radius , @xmath59 and are randomly distributed through a galaxy of radius , @xmath60 , then ( neglecting geometric factors ) the chance of a line of sight through the galaxy intercepting a particular cloud is @xmath61 the probability of exactly n clouds being intercepted if there is a total of n is the binomial distribution ( with @xmath62 ) @xmath63 which has a @xmath64 , and variance @xmath65 .",
    "the mean optical depth , @xmath66 is therefore @xmath67 , @xmath68 as expected and _",
    "independent of the number of clouds_. the variance is @xmath69 , tending to @xmath70 as n becomes large .",
    "we can now sketch the early opactity evolution of a galaxy as it fragments into star forming clouds .",
    "the average optical depth through the galaxy will have a typical value in the visible of @xmath71 until the metallicity has risen above @xmath72 solar ( table  [ tautab ] ) . _",
    "the individual clouds however , will rapidly become optically thick , even at abundances of 1/100 solar _ , provided the mass - radius exponent @xmath73 is less than 2 . as an example , at @xmath74 solar , if @xmath75 and the mass of a typical cloud is as high as @xmath76 , then n is of the order @xmath77 ( equation  [ taun ] ) and @xmath78 .",
    "star formation is likely to occur in the centres of these clouds , so extensive processing of radiation into the ir will take place if the visual and uv optical depth out of the clouds is greater then one .",
    "most of the radiation will come from massive stars , and indeed mckee & tan ( 2002 ) have suggested ( in present day galaxies ) that a mass column density of order @xmath79 is needed for formation of the massive stars .",
    "the surface density of our fiducial cloud is given by @xmath80 so with @xmath81 , dividing into n clouds gives @xmath82    evidently the suitable densities might never be reached if @xmath73 was equal to or around the value of 2 , but with gravitational collapse in the clouds its value will be lower and we can see that densities high enough for massive clouds will be approached , e.g. for @xmath83 as soon as @xmath84 ( corresponding to masses of order @xmath85 ) . such clouds would become optically thick as soon as the metallicity reaches above 1/100 solar , which answers our second question .",
    "so we have a very elementary model of a gas cloud which fragments , forming stars at the dense centers of the sub - clouds . the optical depth from the massive stars",
    "outwards rapidly becomes large enough to reprocess the bulk of radiation into the ir , even when the heavy element enrichment is low ( 1/100 solar ) - provided , of course , that about 40 per cent of the interstellar metals are in the form of dust . the average optical depth _ through _ the galaxy can",
    ", however , remain low at @xmath86 , where @xmath87 until the metallicity exceeds about 1/10 solar .",
    "when will the optical depths decrease again ?",
    "a major process will be the dispersal of clouds due to the effects of massive stars ( e.g. whitworth 1979 , matzner 2000 ) on timescales of @xmath88 a few @xmath76 years .",
    "global winds may pull dust out of the galaxy and ( perhaps relevant to elliptical galaxies ) @xmath70 will fall below 1 again , once @xmath89 is less than 0.02 .",
    "overall , it is clear that the high ir and sub - mm flux from high redshift star forming galaxies is not suprising - there is ample dust available , provided the incorporation of heavy elements into dust is a fairly rapid process .",
    "either sne are a major source of dust cores and/or star formation rates are very high .",
    "we conclude :    * published studies indicate the nucleation conditions for dust formation are only reached in stars during their last ( and shortest ) evolutionary stage ( tpagb for ims and agb / superwind phase for @xmath90 ) .",
    "it appears that it may be easier to form carbon dust than silicates . * in the study of dust in early galaxies a crucial unknown is the relative contribution of sne and stellar winds .",
    "sne could inject dust instantaneously into the ism whereas sw s ( unless from previously unidentified massive star wind sources ) must be delayed because of chemical evolution and stellar lifetimes .",
    "galactic dust suggests about equal contributions at the present day ( e01 ) . by considering current model atmospheres and stellar evolution tracks",
    "we conclude : * * the normalised dust condensation efficiency in stellar winds can be set at a maximum of 45 per cent for solar metallicity , although we believe this may be much lower ( around 16 per cent )",
    ". dust production will be still lower at lower metallicities . * * in searching for dust formation sites it is likely that the tpagb phase of ims stars is the most promising site for dust formation in stellar winds .",
    "it would be interesting to find if an equivalent stage actually exists for massive stars .",
    "* there is no difficulty in producing highly dusty galaxies at redshifts above 5 if sne are an important contributor to interstellar dust .",
    "if grain core destruction is mainly a result of sne shocks the process can not be efficient if grains from the source are to survive .",
    "we note that we have ignored dust destruction mechanisms in this initial model , believing ( e01 ) that such mechanisms may not be efficient and require an extended timescale ( @xmath6yr ) before they can significantly alter the grain core content of the ism .",
    "further studies will be required to demonstrate this is indeed so . *",
    "if sne are not a dominant dust source , significant dust masses can only be generated at redshifts above 5 by galaxies with very high star formation rates .",
    "* high star formation rates required for significant dust production at high redshifts are however consistent with the sfr required to give the observed fir luminosities , producing a consistent picture .",
    "* the average visual optical depth seen in a galaxy with 40 per cent of the interstellar metals in the form of dust will be less than 1 until a metallicity of @xmath72 solar is reached .",
    "the optical depths seen in individual star forming clouds can however reach values greater than 1 at very low metallicites ( 1/100 solar ) , provided that the mass - radius exponent of molecular clouds is less than 2 .",
    "the mass - radius relation is instrumental in determining the optical depth observed in high redshift galaxies if dust is present . in a typical early galaxy",
    "the visual optical depth through it would be patchy ( @xmath86 , with @xmath91 a few ) , allowing glimpses of emerging star forming regions , while most of the radiation from the stars would emerge at ir wavelengths .    in answer to the questions posed in section  [ intro ] ,",
    "the source of dust at high redshift may be attributed to stars only if there are high enough star formation rates and condensation efficiencies .",
    "it appears however , that sne dust must be required if dust is present at redshifts greater than 10 . whether this is an efficient process or not will be addressed in future work .",
    "reduction of scuba data of young snr s will start shortly , with maps at 850 and 450@xmath92 and available radio data providing a direct comparison between the emission from dust and from any synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons .",
    "this work will hopefully provide an estimate of an upper limit of any dust present and a condensation efficiency of sne .",
    "next steps include : ( 1 ) using the modified elementary model to examine the composition and size distribution of dust and its evolution ( 2 ) using the dust masses expected in early galaxies to examine the implications for molecular formation onto grains in the ism ( 3 ) theoretical work on dust nucleation in sne .",
    "we would encourage more extensive modelling of dust formation processes particularly in stellar atmospheres with inhomogeneities and in a wider variety of stars .",
