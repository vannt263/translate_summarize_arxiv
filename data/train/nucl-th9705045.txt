    "quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) is a model for the nuclear many - body problem @xcite describing nucleons interacting with scalar ( @xmath1 ) and vector ( @xmath2 ) mesons . in the mean - field approximation for the meson fields",
    ", it has been shown that the ground - state properties of nuclear matter may be fitted by adjusting the scalar and vector couplings @xcite .",
    "this meson field theory has quite successfully described the properties of nuclear matter as well as finite nuclei using hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the vacuum polarization corrections arising from the nucleon fields @xcite as well as the meson fields @xcite have also been considered to study nuclear matter .",
    "this leads to a softer equation of state , giving a lower value of the incompressibility than would be reached without quantum effects @xcite .",
    "while descriptions of the nuclear phenomena have been efficiently formulated using hadronic degrees of freedom as in qhd , there have been interesting observations such as the emc effect @xcite which reveal the medium modification of the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "this necessitates models that incorporate quark  gluon degrees of freedom respecting the established models based on the hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the quark meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite is a simple extension of qhd incorporating the quark degrees of freedom .",
    "this model describes nuclear matter with nucleons as non - overlapping mit bags and the quarks inside them couple to scalar and vector mesons .",
    "though it is simple and attractive , this model predicts smaller values for the scalar and vector potentials leading to a weaker nucleon spin ",
    "orbit force in finite nuclei .",
    "the understanding of the large and canceling values for the potentials , which has been central to the success of nuclear phenomenology , has been attempted recently through an analysis of a finite - density qcd sum - rule calculations @xcite and is related to medium effects .",
    "this is suggestive of including a medium - dependent bag constant in the qmc model @xcite .",
    "we intend to study here nuclear matter using this variation of the qmc model at finite temperatures taking the medium - dependence of the bag parameters into account .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : in section 2 , we briefly recapitulate the qmc model for nuclear matter at zero temperature @xcite , and in section 3 we generalize it to finite temperature with a specific ansatz for the density - dependent bag constant .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we summarize the results as obtained in this model , discuss its limitations , and present an outlook .",
    "we here briefly recapitulate the qmc model for nuclear matter at zero temperature @xcite . in this model , the nucleon in nuclear matter",
    "is assumed to be described by a static mit bag in which quarks interact with the scalar ( @xmath1 ) and the vector ( @xmath2 ) fields , which are treated as classical in a mean field approximation .",
    "the quark field @xmath3 inside the bag then satisfies the equation @xmath4\\psi_q(\\vec r , t)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the current quark mass and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the quark couplings with the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the normalized ground state for a quark ( in an s - state ) in the bag is given as @xmath8    then the single particle quark energy in units of @xmath9 is @xmath10 with @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the effective quark mass , @xmath13 is the bag radius , @xmath14 is the quark spinor , and @xmath15 is the normalization factor .",

    "@xcite , we now generalize the modified qmc model to study nuclear matter at finite temperatures .",
    "at finite temperatures , the quarks inside the bag can be thermally excited to higher angular momentum states .",

    "further , we take the bag parameters for the free nucleon as @xmath62= 188.1 mev and z=2.03 @xcite and the current quark mass @xmath5 as zero . for @xmath63 , the values of the vector meson coupling and the parameter @xmath35 ,",

    "for specific values of the temperature and @xmath60 , the thermodynamic potential is given in terms of the effective nucleon mass which depends on the bag radius @xmath13 , the quark chemical potential @xmath66 and the mean fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "for given values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the bag radius and the quark chemical potential are determined using the conditions ( [ rr ] ) and ( [ muq ] ) respectively .",
    "we then determine the value of @xmath1 by minimizing the thermodynamic potential @xmath67 , with @xmath2 determined from the self - consistency condition of eq .",
    "( [ omg ] ) .    for given values of the temperature and @xmath60 , we calculate the different thermodynamic quantities along with the bag properties , which are now temperature dependent . in fig .  1",
    ", we plot the pressure as a function of the baryon density @xmath25 for different values of the temperature . for a given @xmath25",
    ", pressure has the usual trend of increasing with temperature @xcite .",
    "the pressure for @xmath68 becomes nonzero at and above a temperature of 200 mev .",
    "this has contributions arising from the thermal distribution functions for the baryons and antibaryons as well as from a nonzero value for the sigma field .",
    "the scalar sigma field attaining a nonzero value was also observed for nuclear matter in the walecka model @xcite , which had led to a sharp fall in the effective nucleon mass between temperatures of 150 mev and 200 mev .",
    "this rapid fall of @xmath69 with increasing temperature resembles a phase transition when the system becomes a dilute gas of baryons in a sea of baryon  antibaryon pairs .",
    "the density- and temperature - dependence of the baryon effective mass is shown in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath69 here increases monotonically with temperature .",
    "this is in contrast to the calculation of hot nuclear matter using walecka model @xcite , where , as the temperature is increased , @xmath69 first rises and then falls rapidly for @xmath70 mev .",
    "we do not encounter any change in the trend here even up to a temperature of 250 mev , even though similar to earlier calculation , the sigma field becomes finite at a temperature of 200 mev .",
    "the reason for this is that the sigma field here is not strong as in ref . @xcite",
    "also , there is a significant contribution to the effective mass arising from the thermal excitations of the quarks inside the nucleon bag .",
    "this adds to the mass of the nucleon whereas the nucleon mass decreases with increase in the value of the sigma field .",
    "the contribution of the former , which was absent in the walecka model calculations @xcite , appears to dominate over the contribution from the nonzero value of @xmath1 and the net effect is a rise of the effective nucleon mass in the present case .",
    "hence , although in the earlier case @xcite the effective mass is identical to the free nucleon mass at zero density and nonzero temperatures before the phase transition takes place , @xmath69 in our calculations has a higher value as compared to the nucleon mass in vacuum .",
    "a similar increase was also observed earlier for the @xmath15 and @xmath71 masses for nonzero temperatures using the thermal skyrmions @xcite .",
    "we then look at the dependence of the entropy density on the density and temperature as shown in fig .",
    "this has a nonzero value even at vanishing baryon density at and above a temperature of 200 mev , with contributions from the nonzero value of the sigma field .",
    "a similar behavior was observed for the entropy density in the walecka model calculations @xcite .",
    "the change in the behavior of the entropy density in the earlier case was rather abrupt indicating a sharp phase transition .",
    "the present calculations show a softening of the phase transition .",
    "the mean field @xmath1 as obtained through the minimization of the thermodynamic potential is plotted as a function of the baryon density for various temperatures in fig .",
    "the sigma field becomes nonzero at a temperature of 200 mev , indicating a phase transition to a system of baryon  antibaryon pairs at very low densities as mentioned earlier .",
    "the value of @xmath1 decreases with temperature at higher densities .",
    "a similar behavior was also observed earlier at temperatures before the phase transition took place @xcite , and had the natural consequence that the effective nucleon mass grows with temperature .",
    "however , at low densities and high temperatures , @xmath1 increases with temperature thus reducing the effective mass in the earlier case . even though the behavior of sigma is similar",
    ", the effective mass here is dominated by the thermal excitations of the quarks which leads to an increase in the effective mass with temperature .",
    "we also look at some other properties of the nucleon bag at finite temperatures .",
    "the bag constant , as shown in fig .",
    "5 , grows with temperature for densities greater than around 0.1 @xmath72 .",
    "this is clear from the form of @xmath73 chosen as in ( [ bagc ] ) , since the mean field @xmath1 decreases with temperature .",
    "the bag constant at zero density is seen to be identical to the free nucleon bag constant for temperatures before the phase transition .",
    "however , at temperatures at and above 200 mev , it starts decreasing with temperature .",
    "the temperature- and density - dependence of the bag radius , in units of the free nucleon radius @xmath74=0.6 fermis , is shown in fig .",
    "the nucleon bag in this model shrinks with increasing temperature .",
    "such a difficulty of obtaining a baryon that swells with temperature was also encountered using the thermal skyrmion @xcite . a possible solution for the difficulty",
    "was suggested in the earlier case @xcite whereby the thermal skyrmion exists in a bath of pions , which effectively increase its radius .",
    "to summarize , we have studied nuclear matter at finite temperatures using the qmc model and taking into account the density  dependence of the bag constant .",
    "the mean fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 were determined through minimization of the thermodynamic potential and the temperature dependent bag radius was calculated by minimizing the effective mass of the nucleon bag . the scalar mean field @xmath1 at zero density attains a nonzero value at a temperature of 200 mev similar to the walecka model calculations for the nuclear matter @xcite , which is indicative of a phase transition to a system with baryon ",
    "antibaryon pairs .",
    "however , there is a softening in the phase transition here as compared to the earlier calculations . this is because the thermal contributions from the quarks , which were absent in ref .",
    "@xcite , are dominant here and lead to a rise of the effective nucleon mass with temperature .",
    "the nucleon bag in the present calculation shrinks in size with increase in the temperature .",
    "the nucleon mass at finite temperatures and zero baryon density as calculated here is appreciably different from the nucleon mass in vacuum .",
