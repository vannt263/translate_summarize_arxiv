    "the chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm ) was developed in 1980 s as a low - energy effective theory of qcd .",
    "since it includes the dirac sea quark contribution and explicit valence quark degrees of freedom , the model interpolates between the constituent quark model and the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "the cqsm incorporates the non - perturbative feature of the low - energy qcd , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath0 solution provides correct observables such as a nucleon including mass , electromagnetic value , spin carried by quarks , parton distributions and octet su(3 ) baryon spectra . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the stable axially symmetric soliton solution was found in ref .",
    "the solution exhibits doubly degenerate bound spectrum of the quark orbits in the background of axially symmetric chiral fields with winding number two . upon quantization ,",
    "various dibaryon spectra were obtained , showing that the quantum numbers of the ground state coincide with those of physical deuteron  @xcite . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the skyrme model predicts that minimum energy solutions have discrete , crystal - like symmetries  @xcite .",
    "according to this prediction , we studied the cqsm with @xmath3 tetrahedrally symmetric chiral fields and obtained triply degenerate spectrum of the quark orbits  @xcite .",
    "its large degeneracy indicates that the tetrahedrally symmetric solution may be the lowest - lying configuration .",
    "thus , for @xmath4 , one can also expect that the lowest - lying solutions in the cqsm inherits the discrete symmetries predicted in the skyrme model and have large degeneracy .    in this paper we shall study soliton solutions with @xmath5 in the cqsm using the rational map ansatz for the background of pion fields .",
    "the procedure of the numerical computation performed here is shown in sec.[sec : level3 ] . in sec.[sec : level4 ] , we show obtained classical self - consistent soliton solutions with @xmath6 .",
    "these solutions exhibit various degenerate spectra of the quark orbits depending on the symmetry of the background chiral fields .",
    "such degeneracy generates large shell gaps , which suggests that the solutions are stable local minima .",
    "evaluating the radial component of the baryon density , shell - like structure of the valence quarks can be observed .",
    "the results and discussion are summarized in sec.[sec : level5 ] .",
    "the cqsm incorporates the nonperturbative feature of the low - energy qcd , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking with the vacuum functional defined by @xcite @xmath7 ,    \\label{vacuum_functional}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the su(2 ) matrix @xmath8 describes chiral fields , @xmath9 is quark fields and @xmath10 is the constituent quark mass .",

    "the classical solutions can be derived by imposing an extremum condition on the effective action with respect to @xmath18 . for this purpose ,",

    ", one can identify the first two terms of eq .",
    "( [ expand_action ] ) with the skyrme model action .",
    "however , the 4th order terms tend to distabilize solutions and no stable classical solution can be obtained from the above action  @xcite . nevertheless , because of their similarity",
    ", it will be justified to adopt the configurations of the solutions in the skyrme model to chiral fields in the cqsm .    in the cqsm",
    ", the number of valence quark is associated with the baryon number such that a soliton with baryon number @xmath14 consists of @xmath21 valence quarks .",
    "if the quarks are strongly bound inside the soliton , their binding energy become large and the valence quarks can not be observed as positive energy particles  @xcite .",
    "thus , one gets the picture of the topological soliton model in the sense that the baryon number coincides with the winding number of the background chiral field when the valence quarks occupy all the levels diving into negative energy region .",
    "let us rewrite the effective action in eq .",
    "( [ effective_action2 ] ) as @xmath22 and introduce the eigenequation @xmath23 the effective action @xmath24 is ultraviolet divergent and hence must be regularized . using the proper - time regularization scheme  @xcite ,",

    "( [ regularized_action ] ) reproduces the pion kinetic term with the correct coefficient ,    @xmath39    the contribution to the total energy in the absence of the chiral fields ( @xmath29 ) can be estimated using the eigenstates of the eigenequation , @xmath40    in the skyrme model it is known that solitons with @xmath5 have discrete crystal - like symmetries  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that soliton solutions of the cqsm inherits the same discrete symmetry as skyrmions . however , it is too complicated to perform a numerical computation if one imposes such discrete symmetries directly on the chiral fields",
    ". thus houghton , manton and sutcliffe proposed remarkable ansatz for the chiral fields , rational map ansatz  @xcite . according to this ansatz",
    ", the chiral fields are expressed in a rational map as @xmath41 where @xmath42,2{\\rm",
    "im}[r(z)],1-|r(z)|^2 ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 is the rational map . the complex coordinate @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 via stereographic projection .",
    "rational maps are maps from @xmath46 to @xmath46 ( equivalently , from @xmath47 to @xmath47 ) classified by winding number . in ref .",
    "@xcite manton _",
    "_ showed that @xmath48 skyrmions can be well - approximated by rational maps with winding number @xmath49 .",
    "the rational map with winding number @xmath49 possesses @xmath50 complex parameters whose values can be determined by imposing the symmetry of the skyrmion .",
    "we shall use this ansatz for the background chiral fields in the cqsm .",
    "their explicit forms are presented in appendix [ sec : levela ] . since the chiral fields in eq .",
    "( [ chiral_fields ] ) is parameterized by polar coordinates , one can apply the numerical technique developed for @xmath0 to find solutions with higher @xmath14 .",
    "detailed calculations will be presented in the subsequent section .",
    "field equations for the chiral fields can be obtained by demanding that the total energy in eq .",
    "( [ total_energy ] ) be stationary with respect to variation of the profile function @xmath51 , @xmath52 which produces @xmath53 where @xmath54 the procedure to obtain self - consistent solutions of eq .",

    "( [ field_equation ] ) to obtain a new profile function , @xmath61 repeat @xmath62 until the self - consistency is attained .    the baryon density @xmath63 is defined by the zeroth component of the baryon current  @xcite ; @xmath64 where @xmath65\\ , .",
    "\\label{baryon_density_element}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to examine the shell structure of the quarks , we evaluate the radial density for the @xmath35th valence quark @xmath66 in which the angular degrees of freedom are integrated out , via , @xmath67 with the baryon number @xmath68",
    "the numerical method that is widely used in this model is based on the expansion of the dirac spinor in the appropriate orthogonal basis .",
    "however , since the symmetries with @xmath5 are discrete and it is hard to find any symmetric operator commuting with the hamiltonian , we shall expand the dirac field in the kahana - ripka basis as in the case of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the kahana - ripka basis which was originally constructed for diagonalizing the hamiltonian with the chiral fields of @xmath0 hedgehog ansatz is a plane - wave finite basis .",
    "the basis is discretized by imposing an appropriate boundary condition on the radial wave functions at the radius @xmath69 chosen to be sufficiently larger than the soliton size .",
    "the basis is then made finite by including only those states with the momentum @xmath70 as @xmath71 .",
    "the results should be , however , independent on @xmath69 and @xmath72 .",
    "the hamiltonian with hedgehog ansatz commutes with the parity and the grandspin operator given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 are respectively total angular momentum and orbital angular momentum .",
    "accordingly , the angular basis can be written as latexmath:[\\ ] ] the @xmath124 is defined by the direct product of these rotation operators toghther with the inverse spatial rotation for the spinor , that is @xmath155 we apply these operators to the kahana - ripka basis @xmath156 and finally obtain the following transformation law : @xmath157 thus we confirm that the @xmath3 tetrahedron exhibits triply degenerate spectra .    99 d. i. diakonov , v. yu .",
