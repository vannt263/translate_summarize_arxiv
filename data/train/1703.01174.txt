    "the shockley - queisser efficiency limit for single - junction solar cells@xcite can be circumvented@xcite by a molecular process called singlet fission in which an optically excited singlet state is converted into a pair of triplet excitons , which are transiently correlated in a spin - zero state .",
    "the prospect of enhancing photovoltaic efficiencies through such an exciton multiplication mechanism has stimulated intense interest in singlet fission.@xcite recent time - resolved spectroscopic studies have provided indications that vibronic coupling plays an integral role in the excited state dynamics of singlet fission materials.@xcite however , a detailed understanding of the mechanisms through which singlet fission occurs remains lacking , and calls for a theoretical study in which a microscopic set of electronic degrees of freedom interacting with vibrational modes are treated non - perturbatively . in the preceding article of this series , hereafter referred to as i , we formulated a vibronic exciton model tailored to meet this demand . using crystalline pentacene as a prototypical fission material we characterized the excited states contributing to linear absorption , paying special attention to the energy and spatial configuration of the correlated triplet pair state ( tt@xmath0 ) , which acts as the first conversion intermediate in singlet fission .",
    "the experimental detection of the fission product states is hindered by the fact that they are essentially optically dark with respect to the ground state , a feature that results from their multi - exciton character and the triplet nature of their constituents .",
    "on the picosecond time scale , singlet fission can be observed through recombination into singlet excitons by means of delayed fluorescence.@xcite transient absorption@xcite and two - photon photoemission spectroscopy,@xcite on the other hand , allow for a sufficient time resolution to resolve the sub - ps fission dynamics in materials such as crystalline pentacene .",
    "accordingly , it is assumed that the product states may be detected through allowed transitions towards other ( auxiliary ) excited states , typically higher - lying triplets or ionized states . however , the disadvantage of such approaches is that the optical signal simultaneously bears the imprints of both the fission product and the auxiliary states .",
    "for example , optical transitions between tt@xmath0 and higher - lying triplet states inform on the relative energy difference of the involved states , but do not reveal their energetic separation from the ground state or the singlet excitation through which the fission process is initiated .",
    "this magnifies the issue that such triplet signals are commonly mapped onto the bright response from the singlet state , rendering the overall spectra congested with features . perhaps for this reason , some of the identified triplet transitions in bulk pentacene@xcite seem inconsistent with measurements@xcite and calculations on non - interacting pentacene molecules,@xcite discrepancies that remain to be clarified.@xcite    most of the aforementioned complications can be circumvented through two - dimensional electronic spectroscopy ( 2des),@xcite which by projecting the optical response to an extra dimension allows one to resolve otherwise overlapping spectral signals.@xcite 2des has served as an important experimental technique for the study of sub - ps quantum dynamics in photosynthesis@xcite as well as synthetic materials@xcite for over a decade , but only recently found its first application in the context of singlet fission in a study on polycrystalline pentacene by bakulin _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite one of the key results of that study was the direct detection of the optical transition between tt@xmath0 and the ground state .",
    "although this transition is extremely weak , this observation was accomplished by creating a coherent vibrational wavepacket in the pair state potential , yielding spectral beats that were enhanced through intensity borrowing .",
    "this experimental result helped clarify the energetic separation of tt@xmath0 from the ground and singlet excited states , and was used in i to parametrize properties of the triplet excitons in the proposed model for pentacene crystals . by further analyzing the 2des measurements through our model , additional crucial information about the excited states involved in singlet fission is readily obtainable .    in the present article",
    ", we extend our theoretical model in order to simulate 2des of fission materials .",
    "this allows us to subject the model to additional tests by comparing simulations to the 2des measurements on polycrystalline pentacene .",
    "perhaps more importantly , however , it allows us to further investigate the microscopic nature of tt@xmath0 through its contribution to time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "in particular , by reproducing 2des features associated with this state , we are able to shed light on its optical transitions towards higher - lying triplet states . in doing so , we address questions regarding the identification of these transitions , while at the same time describing important molecular properties that impact estimates of the associated signal strengths .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after a few remarks on the observation of singlet fission through time - resolved spectroscopy , we review in sec .",
    "[ sec_theory ] the main aspects of the theory introduced in i. subsequently , the necessary extensions of the vibronic basis set and hamiltonian are discussed , followed by the theoretical framework employed to simulate 2des . the section closes with a summary of the associated parameters for pentacene crystals . in sec .",

    "[ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "in order to streamline the discussion , we begin by showing in fig .",
    "[ fig_fissionscheme ] a schematic representation of how sub - ps fission dynamics is typically observed within time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "this illustration is minimal in the sense that it represents the many excited states found in fission materials by a maximally reduced set : a singlet ground state ( s@xmath1 ) , a singlet excited state ( s@xmath0 ) , a correlated triplet pair ( tt@xmath0 ) , and an analogues state that is higher in energy ( tt@xmath2 ) .",
    "these are assumed to be adiabatic states , and as such belong to the quantum basis that is spectroscopically detectable . in a similarly simplified fashion",
    ", time - resolved spectroscopic experiments can be regarded as consisting of two optical excitation events separated in time by some varying interval . the first event ( commonly referred to as `` pump '' )",
    "excites the molecular system from its initial state s@xmath1 to the excited state s@xmath0 .",
    "subsequently , some non - adiabatic mechanism induces a transition from s@xmath0 to tt@xmath0 , after which a second excitation event ( the `` probe '' ) brings the system to the higher - lying pair state , tt@xmath2 .",
    "the observed signal associated with this second transition is used as a time - dependent probe of the fission process.@xcite we note that experiments using two - photon photoemission spectroscopy involved ionized states instead of tt@xmath2.@xcite we will exclude such states from our discussion , and as such limit ourselves to ( third - order ) purely optical techniques such as 2des and transient absorption .    ) , singlet excited state ( s@xmath0 ) , and the low- and high - energy triplet pair states ( tt@xmath0 and tt@xmath2 ) .",

    "this triggers the fission process ( arrow ) .",
    "the second event ( `` probe '' ) couples the product tt@xmath0 state to a triplet pair state that is higher in energy .",
    "together , the states span three different manifolds , between which transitions are only significant when induced by an optical pulse .",
    "the labels `` singly - excited '' and `` doubly - excited '' refer to the number of optical excitation events required to populate the manifolds starting from the ground state , and are not to be confused with the number of involved electron - hole pairs ( excitons ) .",
    "for example , tt@xmath0 is sometimes referred to as a double excitation , being composed of two excitons , but nevertheless resides in the singly - excited manifold as defined here .",
    "numbers indicate energies ( in ev ) obtained for pentacene crystals in our preceding article .",
    "also depicted is the vibrationally dressed triplet pair state ( tt@xmath3 ) , found to be quasi - resonant with s@xmath0 in bulk pentacene ( dash ) in ref .   and in the preceding article .",

    ". electronic couplings between states from different manifolds are usually negligible , and hence transitions between them are only significant when induced by an electromagnetic field . nevertheless , rather than the minimal set of states depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_fissionscheme ] , each manifold in reality consists of a large number of coupled states . in i , we characterized the excited states constituting the singly - excited manifold of crystalline pentacene , while making a connection to the simplified representation of singlet fission as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fissionscheme ] .",
    "this yielded the adiabatic energies reported in this figure , where it should be noted that tt@xmath0 was found to consist of a handful of nearly - degenerate states , in contrast to the single bright state that represents s@xmath0 .",
    "also depicted is the vibrationally dressed analogue of tt@xmath0 ( tt@xmath3 ) , which appears prominently in our results , and which was emphasized earlier by bakulin _ _ et al.__@xcite the underlying nearly - degenerate states are found to be quasi - resonant with s@xmath0 , and have been predicted to be of great importance to the fission dynamics in crystalline pentacene.@xcite    finally , we note that the non - adiabatic dynamics referred to in fig .",
    "[ fig_fissionscheme ] will be a topic of a future study , and is not included in the modeling presented here .",
    "although the contribution of dynamical fluctuations are not present in the calculated spectra , our approach allows one to reproduce the detection of the correlated triplet pair state through a coherently prepared vibrational wavepacket,@xcite which is the primary focus of the present study .      in i , we presented in detail a diabatic vibronic basis set tailored to provide a description of the singly - excited manifold .",
    "the electronic subspace of this basis comprises a microscopic set of singlet states ( s@xmath0 ) , triplet states ( t@xmath0 ) , cationic states ( c ) , and anionic states ( a ) , where triplets always come in pairs and cations and anions always appear together , such that all basis states have zero spin and are charge neutral .",
    "diabatic states are consistently denoted with lower case labels in order to differentiate them from adiabatic states such as s@xmath0 and tt@xmath0 , which in turn consist of mixtures of diabatic states of different character . beside the electronic degrees of freedom ,",
    "the basis includes intramolecular vibrational states accompanying the electronic excitations .",
    "these are denoted @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , for the singlet , triplet , cation and anion , respectively , and are always described in the vibrational potential pertaining to the electronic state of the molecule under consideration .",
    "in addition , the basis contains purely vibrational excitations , where @xmath8 vibrational quanta reside at a molecule in its singlet ground state ( s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the initial steps of singlet fission take place entirely within the singly - excited manifold . when considering linear absorption , or when characterizing the involved excited states , restricting the basis to this manifold alone suffices , as was done in i. however , when considering time - resolved spectroscopic experiments on fission materials , the ground state manifold and doubly - excited manifolds must be included as well .",
    "similarly to i , we adapt the `` two - particle '' approximation,@xcite such that the ground state manifold is spanned by the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 here the first state represents a purely vibrational excitation involving @xmath11 quanta in the s@xmath1 potential of molecule @xmath12 . in the second state , such a vibration is accompanied by a vibrational excitation involving @xmath13 quanta located at site @xmath14 .",
    "( note that @xmath15 is imposed in order to avoid double counting . )",
    "additionally , there is the unique state denoted @xmath16 , in which all molecules are both electronically and vibrationally unexcited .",
    "the doubly - excited manifold , on the other hand , consists of triplet pairs in which one member resides in a higher - lying state .",
    "higher - lying states contributing to time - resolved spectroscopic measurements of singlet fission have been associated with the molecular excitations t@xmath17 and t@xmath18.@xcite we will nevertheless remain non - specific for the moment and consider for each set of calculations a single higher - lying state referred to as t@xmath2 , which suffices to account for the 2des measurements , while leaving a discussion on the nature of this state to sec .",
    "[ sec_triplettransitions ] .",
    "the doubly - excited triplet pairs are thus expressed as @xmath19 representing a t@xmath0 excitation at molecule @xmath12 , accompanied by @xmath5 vibrational quanta , and a t@xmath2 excitation at molecule @xmath14 involving @xmath20 quanta in the associated potential . similarly to pair excitations in the singly - excited manifold , we assume this multi - exciton state to be entangled in a zero spin configuration , following the symmetry - adapted linear combination analogous to that defined for the ( singly - excited ) correlated triplet pair state in ref .  .",
    "the rationale behind this is that optical transitions are spin - conserving , and considering spin dephasing to be insignificant at the ultra - fast timescales considered in this work,@xcite only such overall singlet states can be populated . in principle , the doubly - excited manifold also includes pairs of singly - excited basis states , which can become populated via two optical excitations .",
    "however , for crystalline pentacene , the associated spectroscopic signals do not benefit from the large dipole moment associated with the transition between triplets ( as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_triplettdm ] ) , and are therefore much weaker than the signals associated with the doubly - excited triplet pairs . considering this , and the fact that such basis states would render the calculations prohibitively expensive , we have excluded such states from the doubly - excited manifold .    from the diabatic basis ,",
    "adiabatic states are obtained upon solving the time - independent schrdinger equation , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the hamiltonian of the material under consideration , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent an ( adiabatic ) eigenstate and the associated eigenenergy , respectively .",
    "( similarly to i , we apply @xmath25 throughout this work . )",
    "since we are concerned with three non - interacting excitation manifolds , the hamiltonian can be subdivided according to @xmath26 where the contributions with subscript 0 , 1 , and 2 act in the subspace corresponding to the ground state , singly - excited , and doubly - excited manifolds , respectively .",
    "for the ease of discussion , we will also explicitly differentiate between the eigenfunctions pertaining to these manifolds , denoting them as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we refer to i for a formulation and discussion of the singly - excited hamiltonian @xmath30 , which includes the couplings and energies associated with the vibronic s@xmath0 , t@xmath0 , c and a states , and continue to formulate @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    taking the energy of s@xmath1 as a reference",
    ", the ground state hamiltonian contains only the vibrational energy , @xmath33 , given by @xmath34 here , @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the vibrational ladder operators pertaining to the s@xmath1 potential at molecule @xmath12 , and @xmath37 is the vibrational quantum .",
    "the doubly - excited hamiltonian , on the other hand , contains , in addition to vibrational energy , a contribution from electronic energy and a vibronic coupling term , @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is the diagonal energy of the diabatic pair state involving the higher - lying triplet ( assumed to be independent of the @xmath12 and @xmath14 combination ) . in the vibronic coupling term",
    ", @xmath40 runs over the molecular excitations t@xmath0 and t@xmath2 , and @xmath41 is the associated vibronic coupling strength , the square of which corresponds to the huang - rhys ( hr ) factor . it should be noted that both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are diagonal operators in the diabatic basis , and consequently , the adiabatic states in the associated manifolds are identical to the diabatic ones . however , whereas intermolecular couplings in the ground state manifold are typically very weak , substantial couplings between doubly - excited states are plausible .",
    "the effect of such couplings is touched upon in sec .",
    "[ sec_triplettdm ] .      of central importance",
    "to spectroscopy , be it linear absorption or time - resolved optical techniques , is the transition dipole moment operator @xmath42 of the material under consideration ( bold notation is used throughout to refer to three - dimensional vector properties ) . similarly to the hamiltonian , we subdivide this operator into contributions associated with different ( pairs of ) excited state manifolds as @xmath43 the first term couples the ground state and the singly - excited manifolds through the optical transition from s@xmath1 to s@xmath0 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the associated transition dipole moment of molecule @xmath12 . in contrast , the singly - excited manifold is coupled to the doubly - excited manifold through optical transitions between t@xmath0 and t@xmath2 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the corresponding transition dipole moment .",
    "note that since @xmath48 exclusively contributes to linear absorption , only this part of the transition dipole moment operator was considered in i. however , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_fissionscheme ] , an evaluation of 2des as presented here requires both contributions to @xmath42 to be included .",
    "since we are concerned with one - component crystals ( as opposed to cocrystals ) , all molecular transition dipole moments can be considered identical , aside from the description of the orientation .",
    "we can therefore set @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where the unit vector @xmath51 represents the direction of the i@xmath52f transition dipole moment at molecule @xmath12 , and @xmath53 is the associated ( @xmath12-independent ) magnitude .",
    "furthermore , for the sake of clarity , it is helpful to additionally formulate transition dipole moment operators for which the magnitudes are divided out , @xmath54 and @xmath55 such that the original transition dipole moment operators are retained through @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively ( with or without prime ) .",
    "on the left , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 indicate the `` pump '' time , waiting time , and `` probe '' time . ]    whereas linear absorption is readily calculated via fermi s golden rule , 2des is more naturally evaluated in a time - resolved framework , through the calculation of the associated optical response functions.@xcite these response functions derive from four light - matter interactions , separated in time by the intervals @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . the first two interactions constitute the aforementioned `` pump '' event , whereas the second interaction pair makes up the `` probe '' event , while the time interval @xmath61 , the waiting time , is varied to dynamically study the molecular sample .",
    "what distinguishes 2des @xcite ( as well as its infrared analogue @xcite ) from transient absorption is the ability to simultaneously resolve the pump and probe frequencies",
    ". nevertheless , the underlying response functions are formally equivalent .",
    "the response functions of interest to singlet fission can be divided into four essentially different forms , based on fundamentally different ways in which the density matrix is affected by the four optical interactions .",
    "these are conveniently represented by means of double - sided feynman diagrams , describing the time - evolution of the molecular density matrix , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagrams ] .",
    "the first difference lies in the relative phase accumulations during the pump and probe events , which could have equal signs ( non - rephasing , nr ) or opposite signs ( rephasing , r ) .",
    "the second difference derives from the two physical processes that independently contribute to the spectral signal .",
    "one process , referred to as excited state absorption ( ea ) , is light absorption during the probe event by molecules that have been promoted to the singly - excited manifold by the pump event .",
    "the other relates to the bleaching of ground state absorption during the probe event , due to molecules that have been excited by the pump event , which is referred to as ground state bleach ( gb ) .    under experimental conditions",
    ", it is fundamentally impossible to disentangle gb and ea signals , and the detected spectrum can at most be dissected into nr and r contributions .",
    "this is in marked contrast to numerical calculations , which proceed by separate evaluation of gb and ea , providing an easy venue for comparing the associated signals side - by - side .",
    "singlet fission studies which used transient absorption @xcite or 2des @xcite have monitored triplet transitions that occur via ea as a dynamic probe of the fission process .",
    "from this perspective , gb is an undesirable contributor which complicates the interpretation of the measurements due to spectral congestion .",
    "we further note that , in addition to ea and gb , a third process commonly contributes to time - resolved spectra , in which the probe event induces emission from singly - excited molecules .",
    "however , fission in bulk pentacene is known to depopulate the singlet state within @xmath6380  fs,@xcite and radiative transitions from triplet pair states are generally very weak . as a result ,",
    "such stimulated emission is not observed for this material,@xcite or at most at very early times,@xcite and is therefore neglected in our model .",
    "( for the same reasons , ea pathways involving transitions from the singlet state to higher - lying singlet excitations are neglected . )",
    "the practical implementation of time - resolved spectroscopy relies on the realization of ultra - short laser pulses , particularly so for 2des , which implies a broad laser spectrum in the frequency domain .",
    "nevertheless , the spectral widths of fission materials typically exceed 1  ev , which is unreachable even by most 2des setups .",
    "a simple method to account for a finite laser bandwidth is to multiply the transition dipole moment operator with an adiabatic window function , @xmath64.@xcite accordingly , the transition dipole moment operator is replaced by a laser - corrected analogue according to @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 run over all manifolds .",
    "we have adopted this method , while following the example of ref .   by using a discrete window function @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the heaviside step function , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 characterize the lower and upper bounds of the laser spectrum , respectively . although noting that more sophisticated approaches for incorporating the laser spectrum are available,@xcite we find the current approach sufficient for our purpose .",
    "the response functions depicted in fig .  [ fig_diagrams ] are formulated as    @xmath72    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75    here , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 label the four pulse polarizations .",
    "the minus sign appearing in the ea response functions , resulting from an uneven number of optical interactions at the bra of the molecular density matrix , is representative of the absorptive character of the associated spectral signals .",
    "all response functions are formulated in the frame of reference of the molecular crystal , and @xmath80 refers to the @xmath76-polarized component of @xmath81 ( while the other transition dipole moment operators are labeled analogously ) . however , by having all pulse polarizations in the summation run independently over the unit vectors in the molecular frame ( @xmath40 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 ) , and by weighing the contributions by the appropriate tensor values @xmath84,@xcite we effectively consider an isotropic collective of molecular clusters .",
    "this is used as a proxy for a polycrystalline material , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_2des ] .",
    "lastly , @xmath85 is the molecular propagator , accounting for the time - evolution of the sample in between the ( impulsive ) light - matter interactions .",
    "note that @xmath86 ( identity matrix ) is omitted .",
    "fourier transforming the response functions over @xmath60 and @xmath62 yields the 2d spectra associated with waiting time @xmath61 as a function of the pump frequency @xmath87 and the probe frequency @xmath88 .",
    "most of the parameters for pentacene crystals used in the present article have been presented and discussed in i. we proceed to mention only those parameters that specifically pertain to 2des , and which have therefore not been presented in i. we note , however , that all of these parameters are concerned with t@xmath2 , the higher - lying triplet level included in our basis set . such high - energy states are challenging to evaluate through computations based on first principles , and equally difficult to characterize spectroscopically . as a result , relatively little _ a priori _ knowledge about them is available .",
    "we have therefore motivated the values adapted for these parameters based on the agreement of our calculations with 2des measurements in secs .",
    "[ sec_2des ] and [ sec_ft ] .",

    "an _ ad hoc _ value of @xmath91 is applied , while varying values of this quantity are explored in sec .",
    "[ sec_triplettdm ] .",
    "the direction and magnitude of the t@xmath0 to t@xmath2 transition dipole moments are determined based on the crystal structure of pentacene,@xcite similar to the procedure for the s@xmath1 to s@xmath0 transition in i. whereas @xmath92 is oriented along the short axis of molecules @xmath12 , @xmath93 is found to be oriented along the long axis instead@xcite and adapted accordingly .",
    "regarding their magnitudes @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we first note that these quantities solely act as constants contributing to the response functions given by eq .",
    "[ eq_responses ] .",
    "specifically , the constant contributing to the gb pathways is given by @xmath96 , whereas the equivalent for ea is @xmath97 .",
    "hence , upon setting @xmath94 to an arbitrary value , the magnitude of the triplet transition effectively acts as a weighing of the ea signal relative to the gb analogue through its scaling to @xmath98 . for this reason , and in the light of a current inconclusiveness concerning the strength of the triplet",
    "transitions,@xcite we use @xmath95 as a free parameter , expressed in terms of @xmath94 , while leaving a thorough discussion of this quantity to sec .",
    "[ sec_triplettdm ] .    in i",
    ", we evaluated the convergence of the photophysics of pentacene with respect to the applied crystal size , and found that the linear optical properties are well accounted for when limiting the crystal to 3@xmath993 unit cells extending in the crystallographic @xmath100-plane ( while imposing periodic boundary conditions ) . for pentacene , having 2 inequivalent molecules per unit cell , this amounts to 18 molecular sites .",
    "still , the vibronic basis set employed in our model scales rather unfavorably with the number of electronic degrees of freedom , yielding a total of 2430 states , despite an optimal truncation of the basis set . simulations of 2des involving this number of states are just within the computational capacities at our disposal , and we have adapted the crystal size accordingly . in doing so , the diabatic bases spanning the ground state and doubly - excited state manifolds are truncated analogously to the singly - excited basis discussed in i. specifically , the maximum t@xmath0 to t@xmath2 separation is set to 6.2  , the separation between the two - particle states in the ground state manifold is limited to 20  , and the total number of vibrational quanta per basis state is limited to 2 .",
    "linear absorption has proven indispensable to validate microscopic models of singlet fission.@xcite nevertheless , with the recently reported 2des measurements on polycrystalline pentacene , the opportunity to subject models to an even more stringent test arises .",
    "the ability of 2des to project the optical response of a molecular material to an additional spectral dimension allows one to directly resolve the correlations between excitations over time . on the one hand ,",
    "non - oscillatory signals are representative of energy transfer pathways and couplings between excited states.@xcite on the other hand , oscillatory signals represent coherent dynamics.@xcite in 2des experiments on pentacene , the optical transition between the ground state and the correlated triplet pair state has been directly detected with the help of such quantum beats.@xcite before turning our attention to this spectroscopic result , we first focus on the non - oscillatory signals by comparing our simulations to the measurements of static 2d spectra .    in calculating the static 2d spectra , the underlying response functions ( eq .  [ eq_responses ] ) are evaluated while scanning the pump ( @xmath60 ) and probe ( @xmath62 ) times from 0 to 200  fs using a 1  fs time resolution . as a convenient way to realize spectral broadening ,",
    "a multiplication by the exponential @xmath101 is carried out before performing the 2d fourier transforms , resulting in lorentzian peak profiles along @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in doing so , the lifetime parameter @xmath102 is adjusted such that the lorentzian width corresponds to 27 mev ( 214  @xmath90 ) . while evaluating the crystal , a weighted average is taken over all possible polarization sequences , as embodied by eq .  [ eq_responses ] , effectively regarding the crystal as a member of an isotropic ensemble . in i , this approach was justified for linear absorption of polycrystalline pentacene , since the molecular s@xmath103s@xmath0 transitions are polarized in the @xmath100-plane , for which an effective isotropy occurs in the polycrystalline state .",
    "however , the t@xmath104t@xmath2 transition is oriented parallel to the crystallographic @xmath105-axis , a direction along which polycrystalline pentacene has been shown to be reasonably ordered.@xcite nevertheless , the 2des measurements were recorded by orienting the laser beams at a 50@xmath106 angle relative to this axis,@xcite in order to compromise between maximizing the t@xmath104t@xmath2 signal and minimizing the strong absorption cross - section in the @xmath100-plane ( due to extended in - plane crystal sizes).@xcite we argue that the isotropic calculations presented here , by its weighing of both weak in - plane and strong out - of - plane t@xmath104t@xmath2 signals , forms a reasonable proxy for such an experimental setup . furthermore , we point out that the 2des spectral features are , by construction , qualitatively insensitive to such polarization details , with quantitative differences anticipated only in the relative intensities of gb and ea signals .",
    "another factor that has only a quantitative impact on the features observed in 2des is the magnitude of the triplet transition dipole moment , @xmath95 , relative to that of the singlet transition . as argued in sec .",
    "[ sec_parms ] , this quantity effectively modulates the ea : gb signal ratio via its @xmath107 scaling .",
    "we accordingly utilize the magnitude of this quantity as a parameter to reach agreement with experiment regarding the weighing of oscillatory spectral features from gb and ea in sec .",
    "[ sec_ft ] , yielding @xmath108 .",
    "this value is significantly larger than the magnitude of @xmath109 used in the 2des simulations ref .  , a difference that originates primarily from the much weaker tt@xmath0 oscillator strength obtained in i , which was found to be more realistic with respect to linear absorption features . in sec .",
    "[ sec_triplettdm ] , we highlight several physical factors that additionally impact the ea signal strength , and which allow to account for the 2des measurements using smaller values of @xmath110 .",
    "finally , we note that the quantitative accuracy of our modeling of the gb and ea signals is inherently limited , since aspects such as dynamical population of tt@xmath0 and realistic pulse shapes are not accounted for .        before focusing on the spectral region near the energy of tt@xmath0",

    "<S> singlet fission , the molecular process through which photons are effectively converted into pairs of lower energy triplet excitons , holds promise as a means of boosting photovoltaic device efficiencies . in the preceding article of this series , we formulated a vibronic theory of singlet fission , inspired by previous experimental and theoretical studies suggesting that vibronic coupling plays an important role in fission dynamics . here , we extend our model in order to simulate two - dimensional electronic spectra , through which the theory is further validated based on a comparison to recent measurements on pentacene crystals . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by means of such spectral simulations , we provide new insights into the nature of the correlated triplet pair state , the first product intermediate in the fission process . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we address a disagreement in the literature regarding the identification , energies , and transition dipole moments of its optical transitions towards higher - lying triplet states . </S>"
