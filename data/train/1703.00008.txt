    "optimal control of nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) with wave type solutions became an active research field in the recent years .",
    "we can mention the control of schlgl or nagumo equation with spiral waves @xcite , of classical fitzhugh - nagumo equation with spiral and travelling waves @xcite , of lambda ",
    "omega systems with spiral waves @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate reduced order optimal control of the convective fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) equation modelling blood coagulation and bioreactors @xcite .",
    "the fhn equation is the simplest and most widely used model for describing the complex spatio - temporal behavior of travelling waves in excited media .",
    "in contrast to the classical fhn equation @xcite with a semi - linear pde and with a linear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) , the convective fhn equation consists of a semi - linear pde with monotone cubic nonlinear term for the activator and a linear pde for the inhibitor , modelling excitable systems in moving media .",
    "the discretization of the optimal control problems ( ocps ) with pde constraints in space and time results high dimensional systems . here",
    ", we use symmetric interior penalty galerkin ( sipg ) method for space discretization @xcite .",
    "the discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods are more stable for convection dominated problems than the continuous finite element methods and they do not require the stabilization terms like the streamline upwind / petrov - galerkin method ( supg ) .",
    "the dg methods have several advantages compared to other numerical techniques such as finite volume and finite element methods ; the trial and test spaces can be easily constructed , inhomogeneous boundary conditions and curved boundaries can be handled easily .",
    "the dg methods were successfully applied to linear steady state , time dependent and semi - linear optimal control problems with convection - diffusion - reaction equations @xcite ; to the semi - linear steady state ocps @xcite .",
    "there are two approaches for solving ocps with pde constraints .",
    "the first one is the discretize - then - optimize approach , where the objective function is discretized and the discrete lagrangian is built , and then the optimality conditions are imposed in the discrete setting .",
    "the second one is the optimize - then - discretize approach , where the lagrangian is built for the infinite dimensional problem and then the first order optimality conditions are discretized .",
    "there is no preferred approach @xcite , here we follow the optimize - then - discretize approach using the sipg discretization in space and the backward euler method in time .",
    "we employ the projected nonlinear conjugate gradient ( cg ) method @xcite for solving the nonlinear discrete optimization problem .    due to the computational cost of large scale pde constrained ocps , we consider reduced order optimal control of the convective fhn equation . for a recent overview about the reduced order methods for ocps we refer to @xcite .",
    "the reduced order ocps are solved usually applying the galerkin projection based on the proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) using the snapshots of the discretized state equation . despite its heuristic nature , the pod is currently the most popular and and successful model reduction technique for solving linear and nonlinear ocps .",
    "the pod basis functions contain information from the solutions of the dynamical system at pre - specified time - instances , so - called snapshots , which inhibit the main and relevant physical properties of the state system .",
    "increasing the number of the pod basis functions leads to more accurate reduced order or suboptimal controls , which can be considered as a compensate for the lack of a priori analysis of the pod .",
    "reduced order methods ( roms ) using the pod - galerkin projection for ocps with linear pde constraints are investigated in @xcite and with semi - linear pde constraints in @xcite , where a priori and a posteriori error estimates are derived .",
    "although the pod method is used frequently for nonlinear pdes , the evaluation of the nonlinear term still depends on the dimension of the full order model ( fom ) , i.e. , high dimensional finite element discretized model . the empirical interpolation method ( eim ) @xcite and the discrete empirical interpolation ( deim ) method @xcite",
    "are used to reduce the computational cost for evaluation of the nonlinear terms .",
    "more recently , as an alternative to the deim , the dynamic mode decomposition ( dmd ) @xcite is used to approximate the nonlinear terms of the pdes .",
    "dmd was first introduced by schmid @xcite , rowley @xcite and it is based on the approximation of the linear infinite dimensional koopman operator @xcite . for an overview of the dmd and various applications we refer the reader to the recent monograph @xcite .    in this paper , we compare three different reduced order approaches the proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) , pod with the discrete empirical interpolation ( dmd ) and pod with dynamic mode decomposition ( dmd ) by comparing the accuracy and computational time of the reduced order suboptimal solutions . to our best knowledge , reduced order ocps using pod - dmd are not yet investigated in the literature . when dealing with model order reduction , it is important to have a trade - off between the computational cost and accuracy of the reduced solutions . among these three methods ,",
    "pod - dmd is the fastest , because after collecting snapshots , the nonlinearity disappear and the reduced model becomes a coupled system linear system odes .",
    "also the reduced nonconvex optimization problem for pod and pod - deim , becomes convex for pod - dmd .",
    "the pod is the most accurate but , the slowest .",
    "the pod - dmd is less accurate than the pod , but fastest .",
    "the success of pod depends on the type of the problem .",
    "the reduced or suboptimal control of semilinear pdes @xcite and convection dominated problems with travelling wave solutions require greater number of pod basis functions @xcite , which is also confirmed by numerical results in section  [ numeric ] .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ ocp ]",
    "the ocp with pointwise box constraints governed by convective fhn equation is described .",
    "the first order optimality conditions are derived is section  [ ocp_disc ] with the fully discrete optimal control system in space and time are recalled . in section  [ rom ] , reduced order models pod , pod - deim and pod - dmd are derived for the ocp govermed by the convective fhn equation . in section  [ numeric ]",

    "the complex process of coagulation consists of cascadic enzymatic reactions and feedback loops , differentiated into three stages , initiation ( localized at the vascular damage site ) ; propagation , or spatial expansion of coagulation wave into the vessel ; termination of the biochemical reactions and clot enlargement stoppage @xcite . these ultimately catalyze fibrinogen conversion into fibrin , which polymerizes to form a clot .",
