    "i also note that there are no signatures of compact hot dust emission in nifs observations of local group galaxies m33 and ngc  205 which also have high stellar densities ( but lower dispersions ) .",
    "based on the lack of hot dust emission in these systems , i argue that the hot dust in the nucleus of m32 is likely powered by bh accretion .",
    "the compact hot dust emission appears to be the most luminous bh accretion signature observed in the m32 nucleus . @xcite",
    "analyzed a variety of radio and x - ray data and detect the nucleus only in x - rays , with a 2 - 10  kev luminosity of 9.4@xmath510@xmath8  erg@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "based on this x - ray luminosity and the expected supply of gas available for accretion @xcite found that the radiative or bh accretion efficiency must be very small ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "such low efficiencies are found in radiatively inefficient accretion models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nir emission discussed here would allow for a somewhat higher accretion efficiency , but still likely lower than the 10% efficiency of a canonical accretion disk .",
    "this suggests that strong nir dust emission may be found in lower accretion states as well as the higher accretion states where they have traditionally been observed . the dust emission in seyferts and quasars",
    "is thought to come from a radiatively heated sublimation zone in the accretion disk or at the inner edge of the torus .",
    "however , the excitation mechanism for the hot dust emission in m32 is unclear .",
    "the nir luminosity derived here is two orders of magnitude brighter than the observed x - ray luminosity found by @xcite . in studies of other low luminosity agn ,",
    "the nir to x - ray luminosity ratios are typically unity @xcite .",
    "these systems are somewhat higher luminosity systems than m32 , but all are expected to be radiatively inefficient accretors with similar spectral energy distributions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the observed x - ray luminosity and uv upper limits @xcite are insufficient to supply the radiative energy needed to heat the dust .",
    "both these problems could be solved if the bh accretion in m32 is significantly time variable , with our observations taken at a time when there was higher flux at all wavelengths .",
    "alternatively , the heating of the hot dust could result from mechanical feedback from the bh ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or possibly stellar winds as discussed above .",
    "based on the limited examples of m32 and ngc  404  @xcite , it appears nir spectra at high spatial resolution may be an effective way to search for accretion in the lowest luminosity agn . in both these cases , the nir emission is the most luminous activity tracer , more luminous than the detected x - ray emission .",
    "furthermore , the low luminosity of the x - ray emission ( @xmath39  erg@xmath1s@xmath2 ) can be confused with emission from x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus the nir emission may represent the best indicator of bh accretion if it can be spectrally disentangled from the stellar light .",
    "one very interesting application of this technique would be to search for hot dust emission from accreting bhs in g1 and other globular clusters with putative central bhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in this section i discuss kinematic measurements from the co bandhead of the nifs data .",

    ". the dispersion increases to a maximum of 120  km@xmath1s@xmath2 in the central @xmath42 due to the influence of the bh and unresolved rotation ; outside of this radius , it drops to values of @xmath1560 km@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution is clearly anti - correlated with the velocity , while a more complex but axially symmetric pattern is visible in the @xmath4 map with negative values along the minor axis and strong positive values along the major axis .",
    "the effect of individual stars is clearly seen in the outer parts of the kinematic maps ; these result in lower dispersions , extreme @xmath3 values and strongly positive @xmath4 values .",

    "the @xmath3 distribution is strongly and tightly anti - correlated with @xmath43 .",
    "the highest @xmath4 values are found in the most strongly rotating regions of the m32 nucleus .",
    "both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 trends are remarkably similar to those seen on larger kiloparsec scales in observations @xcite and in recent simulations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 anti - correlation with @xmath43 is naturally explained by the presence of some stars centered at the systemic velocity , while the positive @xmath4 values can also result from the superposition of a cold disk and hot bulge or be a signature of violent relaxation . in combination , these trends suggest the presence of two coincident components in the m32 nucleus , a dominant rotating disk and a thermalized , relaxed bulge structure .    to facilitate visual comparison between our observations and the simulations , in the bottom panels of figure  [ momentsfig ] i have plotted models from @xcite .",
    "the plotted models are the results of 8 gas - rich ( 40% gas ) , equal mass mergers .",
    "the kinematic data was derived by viewing the central few kiloparsecs of these simulations from a variety of lines - of - sight with inclinations consistent with the 70@xmath275@xmath40 inclination for the central disk of m32 found by @xcite .",
    "the slope and extent of the @xmath3-@xmath43 distribution is almost identical to that seen in the simulations . for @xmath4 ,",
    "both the simulations and data have generally positive @xmath4 with a strong similarity in the shapes of the @xmath4-@xmath43 distribution .",
    "the very high @xmath4 ( @xmath44 ) values seen in the m32 data are the result of individual stars and clumps super - imposed on the velocity field .",
    "the kinematic data provide evidence for a two component system including a disk created by gas accretion into the nucleus . however , the details of the gas accretion leading to the formation of the central disk may be somewhat different than in the simulations due to the large differences in scale between them",
    ". embedded disk structures occur in the @xcite simulations only in gas - rich major mergers and form on short timescales .",
    "however on the smaller scales of the m32 nucleus , it is possible that lower gas fraction mergers , gas - rich minor mergers , or even secular processes are still capable of creating the disky kinematics seen in m32 on parsec scales .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , we present evidence that a minor merger @xmath151  gyr ago in ngc  404 appears to be responsible for a burst of star formation that formed @xmath155 million solar masses of stars in the central 10  pc of that s0 galaxy .",
    "another possibility for formation of nuclear disk is the gradual accretion of material from stellar winds at the center of the galaxy as described by @xcite .",
    "this would naturally lead to a gradual trend in stellar age @xcite and the lack of any break in the rotation curve @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this scenario may naturally account for the abundance gradient in the nucleus ; @xcite and @xcite find the [ mg / fe ] ratio is significantly subsolar in the nucleus and increases with increasing radius .",
    "if the stars in the nucleus were made from the stellar winds of previous generations of stars , then this might result in a drop in the [ mg / fe ] ( e.g. as in the milky way globular cluster ngc  2808 ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is sufficient mass in the bulge of m32 to supply the necessary gas to the nucleus .",
    "however , whether the gas would actually end up as a rotating structure at the center would require detailed hydrodynamic simulations . this scenario could also be tested using stellar population modeling of resolved stars and spectra in and around the nucleus if the models are accurate enough to distinguish between populations of intermediate ( 2 - 10  gyr ) age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "simulations by @xcite follow gas accretion down to parsec scales in galaxy mergers and find that gas accretion in the presence of bhs cause the formation of lopsided disks .",
    "these disks correspond quite well to the eccentric disk seen in m31 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite suggest that this disk formed at the same time the m31 bh was growing . due to the parsec scale of the expected asymmetries ,",
    "m32 is one of the few other galaxies close enough for the asymmetries to be seen .",
    "if the m32 nucleus had a major merger formation scenario similar to that considered by @xcite , a lopsided nuclear disk would be expected . while m32 clearly does not have the prominent asymmetric structure similar to that seen at the center of m31 , i analyzed hst images to see if there is any evidence for a lower level asymmetry .",
    "archival hst wfpc2/pc images were obtained in four bands ( f336w , f555w , f675w , and f814w ) from the cadc wfpc2 associations .",
    "i then fit axially symmetric model profiles to the data , subtracted these off and examined the residuals .",
    "fits to the images in each filter were performed on the central 20  of each image using elliptical double srsic profiles .",
    "the outer srsic component was constrained to have the same indices and effective radii as fits to the 1-d m32 surface - brightness profile by @xcite and @xcite that include measurements from the same f814w hst data we use here .",
    "all fits were convolved with an appropriate tinytim wfpc2 psf @xcite .",
    "the resulting fits accurately described the light profile at all radii to within 3% .",
    "the inner srsic profile fits had effective radii of 1.5 - 1.6 , consistent with that found by @xcite , minor - to - major axis ratios of 0.73 and position angles of @xmath4520@xmath40 .",
    "after subtraction of these profiles , some asymmetric residuals were visible ( see fig .  [ residfig ] , left panel ) . to quantify these , i compared the total residual flux on one side of the minor axis to the other in elliptical annuli ( fig .",
    "[ residfig ] , right panel ) . at radii between",
    "0@xmath1745 and 1@xmath178 ( @xmath152 - 7  pc ) there is an excess of 1 - 2% of the total flux in the southern half relative to the northern half .",
    "this is seen most clearly in f555w and f675w , and is also present but less clear in the other two bands due to lower s / n ( at f336w ) and increased surface brightness fluctuations ( in f814w ) .",
    "this small photometric asymmetry is much less lopsided than the central part of m31 ( where the disk eccentricity @xmath1540% ) .",
    "the asymmetry corresponds to a total mass of @xmath154@xmath510@xmath46  m@xmath7 derived from the f814w band using the mass - to - light ratio from @xcite .",
    "it is unclear if such small asymmetries are consistent with the @xcite model .",
    "the physical situation in m32 is quite different from m31 , with a much smaller bh mass and a higher stellar density .",
    "simulations that are more appropriate to m32 may serve to both ( 1 ) help understand in detail how the m32 nucleus formed , and ( 2 ) test the feasibility of the lopsided disk model for driving bh growth in lower mass systems .",
    "in this paper , i have presented results on the current and past gas accretion in the m32 nucleus using adaptive optics assisted gemini / nifs data .",
    "the data reveal an unresolved emission component at the center of m32 that results in the weakening of co lines and reddening of the continuum slope in the nucleus .",
    "this emission appears to originate from hot dust emission close to the bh as seen in many higher luminosity agn .",
    "the hot dust emission is unresolved with a size of @xmath130.9  pc and has a luminosity of @xmath152@xmath47 erg@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "this luminosity is more than two orders of magnitude more luminous than the x - ray emission detected from the central bh by @xcite , the only other bandpass in which emission due to accretion has been detected in this galaxy .",
    "combined with similar emission in the nearby low luminosity liner ngc  404 , this suggests that high resolution nir spectra may be an efficient way of locating low level activity from bhs in nearby galaxies and globular clusters .",
    "i also present the highest quality kinematics of the m32 nucleus currently available , potentially useful for any future dynamical studies of this benchmark system .",
    "these measurements cover the central 3@xmath53  with a resolution of 0@xmath1725 .",
    "the very high signal - to - noise of these measurements allows accurate determination of the higher order moments which reveal a remarkable kinematic signature similar to those seen on larger scales in elliptical galaxies and merger simulations .",
    "the signature manifests as an anti - correlation of @xmath3 with @xmath43 and strongly positive @xmath4 especially in areas of strong rotation .",
    "these kinematics suggest the presence of a dominant disk component embedded in a pressure supported system .",

    "<S> , i find evidence for unresolved dust emission resulting from bh accretion . with a luminosity of @xmath0  erg@xmath1s@xmath2 , this dust emission appears to be the most luminous tracer of current bh accretion , two orders of magnitude more luminous than previously detected x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> these observations suggest that using high resolution infrared data to search for dust emission may be an effective way to detect other nearby , low luminosity bhs , such as those in globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> i also examine the fossil evidence of gas accretion contained in the kinematics of the stars in the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the higher - order moments ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) of the line - of - sight velocity distribution show patterns that are remarkably similar to those seen on larger scales in elliptical galaxies and in gas - rich merger simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics suggests the presence of two components in the m32 nucleus , a dominant disk overlying a pressure supported component . </S>",
    "<S> i discuss possible formation scenarios for the m32 nucleus in the context of the kinematic data as well as previous stellar population studies . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic measurements presented here are the highest quality available for the nucleus of m32 , and may be useful for any future dynamical models of this benchmark system . </S>"
