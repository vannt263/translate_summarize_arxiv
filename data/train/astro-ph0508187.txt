    "massive wolf - rayet stars are important objects of study for two reasons .",
    "first , the wolf - rayet ( wr ) phase of massive star evolution has itself been a significant challenge to models of extreme mass loss ( hillier 2003 ) and represents the likely precursor stage to chemically - peculiar core - collapse supernovae ( type ib and ic : woosley , heger & weaver , 2002 ) , which has directed attention toward understanding their structure and variety .",
    "second , their galactic demographics both as a function of wr sub - type and , more generally , as markers of star - forming activity has also attracted attention in order to achieve a better understanding of their stellar evolutionary origins ( maeder & meynet 2000 ) and their impact , as luminous objects blowing chemically - enriched , high - speed winds into their galactic environments ( e.g. homeier et al 2003 ) .",
    "wr stars possess very distinctive spectra , dominated by high - contrast , broad emission lines .",
    "this reflects the strong mass loss that follows on from the loss of the hydrogen - rich atmosphere that these stars were born with , as higher mass ( @xmath2  m@xmath3 ) o stars .",
    "wr stars are most commonly h - deficient objects , and so do not normally display prominent hydrogen emission lines in their spectra , but are characterised instead by strong emission lines of he , n and c. the equivalent width ratios between the various emission lines in wr spectra allow their classification into subclasses and subtypes .",
    "wr stars whose spectra are dominated by lines of nitrogen and helium are termed wn stars , whilst stars displaying strong carbon , oxygen and helium lines are assigned wc or wo classifications .",
    "subtypes then refer to the ionisation degree of the star with the wn 39 and wc 49 sequences each going from higher to lower ionisation states .",
    "this paper presents the discovery of five galactic massive wolf - rayet stars , by means of spectroscopic follow - up of the anglo - australian observatory united kingdom schmidt telescope ( aao / ukst ) h@xmath0  survey of the southern galactic plane and magellanic clouds ( parker et al 2005 ) .",
    "these new discoveries are located in a relatively small sky area , roughly centred on @xmath4 and spanning just 4@xmath52 square degrees .",
    "the exceptionally dense young star cluster westerlund  1 ( westerlund 1987 , clark & negueruela 2002 ) lies near the edge of this region . intriguingly , these 5 objects were the only wr stars discovered in spectroscopy of targets within a larger 62 square degree area , which also yielded more than 70 new h@xmath0  emission line stars ( hopewell et al , in prep ) .",
    "two of our discoveries lie within the sky area covered by shara et al ( 1991 , 1999 ) , in their blue narrowband search for wr stars .",
    "it is striking that all five new wr stars are shown to belong to the same spectral sub - type  wc9  and all are reasonably bright , with @xmath6 magnitudes in the range @xmath7 .",
    "the total number of known galactic wc9 stars previously stood at 39 ( van der hucht 2001 : 30 , homeier et al .",
    "2003 : 3 , lavine , eikenberry & davis 2003 : 2 , negueruela & clark 2005 : 4 in wd 1 ) ) and as such the five discoveries reported here represent a significant addition to this sample .",
    "the observations revealing them were obtained a year after and using the same spectroscopic facility as the discovery observations of only the fourth known galactic wo star , wr 93b ( drew et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the aao / ukst h@xmath0  survey of the southern galactic plane and magellanic clouds was the last photographic ukst sky survey to be carried out .",
    "it is described in full by parker et al ( 2005 ) .",
    "it was a narrow band photographic sky survey of the entire southern plane of the milky way for galactic latitudes @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 b @xmath10 + 10 @xmath9  and consisted of 233 galactic plane and 40 magellanic cloud fields on 4-degree centres .",
    "the survey was completed in 2003 and is available online , as supercosmos scans of the original survey films at 10 @xmath11 m resolution ( shs database , located at http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/sss/halpha/ ) .",
    "this survey used a high specification , single element h@xmath0  interference filter with a 70  @xmath1   bandpass .",
    "this , together with fine - grained tech - pan emulsion as the detector , allowed a survey of galactic ionised hydrogen , combining large area coverage with good sensitivity and arcsecond resolution . for each field",
    "the aim was to take 15-minute broad - band short - red exposures alongside the 3-hour h@xmath0   exposures to produce contemporaneous exposure pairs . in the shs ,",
    "the h@xmath0and short - red data are combined with @xmath12 band data from the older ukst ivn southern sky survey .",
    "since the completion of the survey , a programme of spectroscopic confirmation of point - source candidate h@xmath0  emitters from the shs database has been undertaken , using the ukst 6df multi - object facility .",
    "this programme is finding all types of h@xmath0  emitting point sources in the galaxy , many of which represent short - lived evolutionary phases which are , correspondingly , rarely observed . here",
    "the focus is on wr stars : their detection via the ukst survey and shs database , typically resulting from the inclusion of the strong he  ii and/or c  ii lines at @xmath13  6570  @xmath1  within the h@xmath0  filter bandpass .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the next section discusses the method of target selection used for the ukst 6df follow - up spectroscopy program and gives magnitudes and positions for the new wr stars .",
    "section 3 then provides information about the observations and explains the relevant data reduction procedures .",
    "the 6df data , details of spectral subtype identification and comments on individual spectra are presented in section 4 .",
    "we then consider estimates of the dust emission , reddening and distances to the new wr stars in section 5 .",
    "finally , we close in section 6 with a comparison of this red selection of wr stars to selections made at other wavelengths , and a brief comment on how these new stars relate to the previously known wc9 sample .",

    "the coordinates of wr 77aa place it within 5  arcmin of westerlund 1 , the star cluster which first motivated our investigation of this region .",
    "wr  77aa has the largest reddening ( a@xmath15 mags ) of the five wc9 stars discussed here , not far short of the a@xmath16 = 13.6 estimated by clark et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for a number of ob supergiants at the core of wd  1 , for which clark et al .",
    "estimate a distance of 2    5.5  kpc .",
    "the distance of 2.2@xmath171.4 kpc derived here for wr 77aa opens the possibility of association with wd  1 .",
    "the allocation of a wc9 class to all five of the wr stars discussed here is consistent with the already known galactic distribution of this class of object .",
    "the 5 wc9 stars presented here fall within @xmath18 and @xmath19 with galactocentric radii in the range @xmath20  kpc ( table  [ reddust ] ) .",
    "this finding is based on distance estimates that are presently uncertain by as much as @xmath212  kpc .",
    "once ccd photometry becomes available for these newly - discovered wc9 stars , these errors will fall .",
    "the small region encompassing the five new wolf - rayet stars partially overlaps the area covered by the shara et al .",
    "( 1991 , 1999 ) survey for galactic wr stars , with wr 75aa , 75d and 77aa all falling within the overlap region .",
    "their survey used the comparison of narrow and broadband photometry centred on the 4686  @xmath1  wr emission line feature to select wr candidates for spectroscopic observation .",
    "it probed down to a blue magnitude of @xmath22 and was considered to be complete for the detection of single wr stars at the 90% level down to @xmath1317.5 .",
    "the broadband magnitudes listed by shara et al . for the stars discovered by their survey tend to be fainter than the @xmath23 magnitudes for the same stars given in either the whole - sky gsc 2.2 or usno b1.0 catalogues .",
    "this no doubt reflects the difference between effective @xmath24 mean wavelengths , which are somewhat shorter in the shara et al measurements .",
    "however , as usno b1.0 magnitudes are also available for the new discoveries we need to use them in comparing the @xmath23 and @xmath6 magnitudes of the new wc9 stars with those of the shara et al sample ( fig  [ sharamags ] ) .",
    "this comparison demonstrates that the new wolf - rayet stars selected from the shs , with @xmath6 magnitudes in the range @xmath25 , overlap with and reach beyond the faint end of the shara et al survey .",
    "the shara et al ( 1991 ) survey was the last large scale optical survey for galactic wr stars .",
    "all other galactic wr star discoveries since 1991 have either been the result of the reclassification of previously known emission line objects or resulted from nir / mir / radio observations .",
    "longer wavelengths suffer far less severely from the effects of extinction , and so allow the detection of wr stars in distant parts of the galaxy obscured by large columns of dust .",
    "recent wr star searches have therefore focused on @xmath26 band ( 2@xmath11 m ) observations . in such searches there is a potential bias toward the discovery of wc9 stars with nir continuum excesses as they are brighter at nir wavelengths .",
    "but , at the same time emission line ews in wc9 stars nir spectra may be reduced by the added dust continuum , and therefore become harder to detect .    in order to estimate the frequency of occurrence of dust emission in late wc stars ,",
    "a sample that is flux - limited at wavelengths shortward of 1  @xmath11 m could help avoid the biases that might be acting at longer wavelengths .",
    "of the five newly - discovered wc9 stars presented here , selected via their strong c  ii @xmath276578,6582 emission , two have turned out not to possess nir excesses attributable to dust .",
    "up to now , just five  out of the more than 30 known wc9 stars  have been recognised as belonging to this category .",
    "three of them were discussed by williams & van der hucht ( 2000 ) .",
    "the other two , wr  75a and 75b , were products of the shara et al survey , and were recognised as lacking nir excesses by van der hucht ( 2001 ) .",
    "so all seven objects , making up this group , are optical discoveries .",
    "it was noted a long time ago ( e.g. smith 1968 ) that galactic wc9 stars are found only inside the solar circle . despite the large increase in the numbers of known galactic wc9 stars since then",
    ", this conclusion still holds . in the lower metallicity large magellanic and small magellanic clouds , no wc9 stars at all are knownbat99 - 4 is listed as type wc9+o8v in the breysacher et al ( 1999 ) catalogue of wr stars in the lmc , but it is noted that this typing had been dismissed by moffat ( 1991 ) .",
    "heydari - malayeri & melnick ( 1992 ) confirmed that the older wc9 assignment was not warranted . .",
    "in contrast to this , m83  a metal rich spiral like the milky way  has been shown to host a large number of late wc stars , including some wc9s ( hadfield et al , 2005 ) .",
    "another aspect to this is the recognition that there is a gradient in the number of wc type stars relative to wn stars such that the wc types are relatively more numerous at smaller galactocentric distances ( @xmath28 , massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "our selection should not be biased towards the selection of wc9 stars as all wr subclasses show h@xmath0  , heii or c emission which falls within our 70@xmath1  bandpass ( cf . discovery of wo star wr 93b , drew et al 2004 ) . all 5 sharing the same wr subtype can therefore be seen as an indication of the preponderance of late wc stars in the inner milky way .",
    "however the fact remains that extrapolation inwards of the solar circle of the trend in the surface density of _ all _ types of wr star would indicate many more wr stars at @xmath29 might well be present than are actually known ( see figure 10 in van der hucht 2001 ) ! accordingly , it is interesting and encouraging that this relatively shallow trawl of 4 shs fields , based on red rather than either infrared or short wavelength optical data , has already produced 5 new strongly - reddened wr stars scattered across a mere @xmath218 square degrees , albeit embedded within a total search area of @xmath2148 square degrees .",
    "no two of the stars found are likely to be within the same cluster .",
    "we conclude that optical searches of the galactic plane for new massive wr stars remain worthwhile , if taken to greater depths of @xmath30 that still lie well within the grasp of even 4-metre class telescopes .      eh and",
    "mp both acknowledge the support of postgraduate studentships funded by the particle physics & astronomy research council of the united kingdom .",
    "this paper makes use of : data obtained with the aao / uk schmidt telescope at siding spring observatory , nsw , australia ; the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france ; data products from the two micron all sky survey ; data from the usnofs image and catalogue archive ; data from the guide star catalogue ii and data from the deep near infrared survey ( denis ) .",
    "we also acknowledge the use of starlink software in both the reduction and analysis of our spectroscopic data .",
