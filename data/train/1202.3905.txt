    "properties of dipole - dipole ( dd ) interactions , namely their long  range character and anisotropy , allow dipolar condensates to exhibit many unusual properties not found in becs with just contact interactions @xcite . in particular the existence of stable isotropic and anisotropic two  dimensional ( 2d ) solitons has been predicted for such cold quantum gases @xcite .",
    "recently the bright solitons in quasi-1d dipolar bec with competing local and nonlocal interactions have been studied in works @xcite .",
    "the long - range dipolar interactions become dominant when the local part is detuned to zero by the feshbach resonance ( fr ) techniques , as in the experiment on observation of anderson localization in non - interacting cold quantum gases @xcite . in this particular case",
    "the pure dipolar bright soliton can be observed .",
    "the propagation of such solitons under joint action of the trap and a barrier potential , including processes of crossing the barrier by the soliton during its oscillations in the trap are of the greatest interest to investigate .",
    "such processes have a fundamental importance for the problems of entanglement of quantum solitons in cold dipolar gases .",
    "an interesting limit is the case of strong nonlocality when the dynamics of wavepackets become almost linear .",
    "this paper is devoted to the investigation of the properties of cold quantum gases in the presence of long  range dipolar interactions at the mean field level .",
    "first we study oscillations of the dipolar solitons in trap potential using the variational approach ( va ) and the scattering theory .",
    "second we consider the soliton transmission , reflection and splitting through a barrier placed in the center of the trap .",
    "particular attention will be devoted to a process of coalescence of colliding wavepackets at the barrier which could be important for the design of beamsplitters and matter wave interferometers using matter wave solitons@xcite .",
    "finally , by means of numerical simulations of the original dynamical equation we verify the predictions of the va and analyze the results beyond the analytical predictions .",
    "we consider the quasi-1d dipolar bec loaded in a parabolic trap with a barrier at the center of the trap .",
    "the governing equation is the 1d gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) with a nonlocal interaction term  @xcite : @xmath1 here @xmath2 corresponds to the transverse trap frequency , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the magnetic dipole moment oriented along the @xmath5-direction .",

    "the wave function @xmath29 has normalization @xmath30 .",
    "the following two forms for the kernels in the nonlocality term are possible @xmath31 the former kernel corresponds to the dipolar bec in a quasi-1d trap @xcite , while the latter one , which contains a cutoff parameter @xmath32 also proposed for dipolar bec in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is more convenient for analytical treatment .    using the matching conditions for @xmath33 @xmath34",
    "it can be found that @xmath35 .",
    "the comparison of profiles of the kernels ( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) at this choice of @xmath32 shows very good fit .",
    "the cutoff parameter @xmath32 has the meaning of an effective size of the dipole and the value is fixed by interpolating the function @xmath36 by @xmath37 .",
    "actually , it takes the value of the order of the transverse confinement length , which makes the model one - dimensional , and is the unit length in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) . in the limit @xmath38 , where dd interaction effects dominate over the contact interaction effects , both response functions behave as @xmath39 .",

    "finally , from ( [ avl ] ) we obtain the system of equations for the soliton width and the center of mass @xmath63 where @xmath64 thus the evolution is described by the dynamics of two coupled nonlinear oscillators . from the first equation we can find the fixed point for the soliton width @xmath65 and from the second we can calculate the effective potential @xmath66 for the center of mass of the soliton .",
    "the description of the dipolar soliton dynamics by the system of two coupled nonlinear oscillators was applied successively , for example , in the work @xcite where soliton - soliton scattering in the dipolar bec placed in unconnected layers was considered.this method was also used to observe oscillations of the solitons profile in the quasi-1d dipolar bec in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also want to note that the gaussian trial function gives good results for describing the stationary states and dynamics in quasi-1d and -2d geometries ( see for example @xcite ) . in some cases , for 2d geometries , when the purely dipolar bec profile ( for parameters unstable to collapse ) has blood - cell forms , this ansatz failed , and it is necessary to choose the trial function as the sum of gaussian profiles @xcite . in our case",
    "the failure of the ansatz can occur when the pulse is splitted into two or more parts by the defect .",
    "we start with the case of competing nonlinearities ( @xmath67 ) , namely we consider an attractive local nonlinearity , @xmath68 , and a repulsive dd interaction , @xmath69 , or vice versa . by using ansatz @xmath70 and considering @xmath71 we get the stationary equation @xmath72",

    "[ g_1_q ] by solving numerically eq.([gpe_st ] ) ( by newton iteration algorithm ) we present the existence curves for families of the solutions with different combination of local and nonlocal terms . in fig.[q_1_g](a ) we start with the simple local case ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) for which the norm of the solution @xmath77 goes to 0 as the chemical potential @xmath78 goes to 0 . by increasing gradually the coefficient @xmath79 in the nonlocal term we pass through the critical value of @xmath80",
    "for which , at some @xmath81 , the existence curve starts to have a local minimum becoming _ bounded _ by critical value @xmath82 which means that below @xmath83 the solutions do not exist . for two branches in fig.[q_1_g](a ) corresponding to the purely local case ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) , and with competing local and nonlocal terms , ( @xmath75 , @xmath84 ) we calculated numerically the width of the stationary solutions @xmath85 and",

    "observes good agreement between the width calculated numerically and from the va .",
    "_ however by increasing the repulsive nonlocal term the discrepancy between @xmath87 and @xmath65 starts to grow and for @xmath88 results from the va for small @xmath89 does not agree with the width of the solution calculated numerically . _    in fig.[dyn ]",
    "we have checked dynamically the stability of the solutions at the black and red points indicated in fig.[q_1_g](a ) where the derivative @xmath90 has different signs . according to vakhitov - kolokolov stability criterion",
    "these two solutions should have different stability . in fig.[dyn](a )",
    "the profiles of these two solutions are shown and in the panels ( b ) , ( c ) their evolutions are presented . as it is expected",
    "the solution with @xmath91 is stable while the solution with @xmath92 is unstable , which is confirmed by direct numerical simulation in fig.[dyn](b ) , ( c ) .",
    "similar analysis for the existence of the solutions with attractive nonlocal interaction ( @xmath93 ) and with the presence of the local repulsive interaction ( @xmath94 ) is presented in fig.[g_1_q ] .",
    "now , contrary to the previous case , the norm of the solutions is always unbounded which means that @xmath95 as @xmath96 .",
    "also in this case the width of the solutions calculated numerically from eq.([width ] ) and analytically from the va are in very good agreement ( see fig.[g_1_q](b ) ) .",
    "now we consider the dynamics of the soliton with local and nonlocal interactions in the presence of the parabolic potential @xmath97 and the localized defect @xmath98 . since we are interested in competing local and nonlocal nonlinearities ( condition @xmath67 ) in the following we will consider two possible combinations separately : i ) @xmath99 , @xmath100 ; and ii ) @xmath94 , @xmath101 .",
    "let us first concentrate on the case of attractive local ( @xmath75 ) and repulsive nonlocal ( @xmath102 ) interactions when the existence curve is bounded by the critical norm @xmath83 , which occurs above @xmath103 . in fig.[fig1 ] the initial profile of the unperturbed stable soliton taken from the existence curve in fig.[q_1_g ] at @xmath104 and shifted to the position @xmath105 , as well as the corresponding external parabolic potential with the defect are shown .",
    "the shift from the center is used to get oscillations of the soliton in the defect - free parabolic potential .    as soon as the soliton is shifted from the minimum of the parabolic potential it starts to accelerate to the center and",
    "the soliton velocity at the center , @xmath106 , will depend on the strength of the parabolic potential @xmath22 and magnitude of the shift @xmath107 according to @xmath108 . in this way by changing the strength of the trap with fixed @xmath107 we can control the soliton velocity in the process of the interaction of the soliton with the defect . in the defect - free parabolic trap the frequency of oscillations of the soliton coincides with the trap frequency ( @xmath109 ) . by fixing the amplitude @xmath23 and the width @xmath110 of the defect and letting the soliton collide with the defect we found three characteristic regimes of the soliton - defect interaction depending on the incoming velocity . in fig.[fig2 ] we present two regimes .",
    "the first one corresponds to a relatively small soliton velocity ( weak trap ) when the soliton is reflected from the defect and becomes `` closed '' in the semi - space ( @xmath111 ) of the parabolic potential ( see fig.[fig2](a ) ) . by increasing the soliton velocity by changing the strength of the parabolic potential we found another limiting case when the soliton has enough kinetic energy to pass through the defect ( see fig.[fig2](b ) ) . to visualize the corresponding evolutions we calculated the norms in the right part and in the left part from the defect as @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig2](c),(d ) which confirm the above mentioned soliton behavior .",
    "we also compared direct numerical calculation of the soliton dynamics with the results obtained from the va . in fig.[fig2](a),(b ) by dashes lines we present the trajectories of the oscillations of the center of mass of the soliton calculated from eqs.([ua ] ) , ( [ uz ] ) .",
    "a more interesting effect of the coherent splitting of the soliton by the defect is observed for intermediate values of @xmath22 .",
    "this is the case when the va fails and only numerical calculation will be presented .",
    "we found ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) that taking the strength of the parabolic potential around @xmath114 one can observe splitting of the soliton into two quasi - symmetrical parts .",
    "this can be seen from the evolution of the norms @xmath115 and @xmath116 in fig.[fig3](b ) , ( c ) .",
    "it should be stressed here that after splitting the soliton lost its solitonic identity as soon as in this case the existence curve has bounded norm @xmath83 and the norm of the each parts is below this critical value ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) . to confirm this behaviour we switch off the parabolic trap and take a soliton with initial velocity @xmath119 far from the defect . as it is shown in fig.[fig3_v ] , after interaction with the defect the soliton splits into two packets which transform continuously into linear waves . in the presence of the trap",
    "these linear packets do not escape but they are reflected by the parabolic potential and return to the center where again produce the initial soliton ( `` fusion '' ) in the left or right part of the defect and continue this process through several periods . in fig.[fig3](a )",
    "one observes that after splitting and returning to the center the soliton continues to move towards the negative @xmath120 passing completely through the barrier while in [ fig3](b ) soliton after fusion is reflected from barrier .",
    "it should be stressed that very tiny changes in the initial conditions could affect the condition for the soliton splitting and the dynamics of the soliton after fusion ( transmission or reflection scenarios ) .    in this case",
    "the va can be used to find the condition for soliton splitting . as follows from eqs.([var_a ] ) , ( [ ua ] ) , when the kinetic energy of the effective particle @xmath121 is less then the barrier effective potential height @xmath122 , a full reflection of the soliton occurs . in the opposite case",
    "we have full transmission ( compare figs.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "therefore we can assume that when @xmath123 , the partial reflection / transmission should take place .",
    "considering this condition as the soliton splitting condition , we obtain : @xmath124 by comparing the numerical results with the analytical ones taken from ( [ x0 ] ) one observes excellent agreement ( see fig.[x0_v0 ] ) .    for smaller strength of the repulsive nonlocal nonlinearity , when the norm of the solution is unbounded , one observes a rather different picture of splitting of the soliton at the defect ( see figs.[fig3_g0 ] )    comparing fig.[fig3 ] and fig.[fig3_g0 ] one can conclude that in the case @xmath102 the soliton transforms into two quasi - identical wave packets in fig.[fig3](a),(b ) ( one also observes this effect looking at @xmath125 when along a half period @xmath126 ) while in the case @xmath76 there is no splitting of the soliton . instead of that it transforms into the defect mode localized at the defect .",
    "this can be verified in fig.[q_1_g_v ] by comparing the existence curves for the case without defect with curves calculated in the presence of the defect .",
    "as one can see in fig.[q_1_g_v ] by switching the defect on the existence curves go upper and what is essential is that the critical value of @xmath79 at which the existence curves become bounded also decreases with presence of the defect . as an example",
    "the existence curve for @xmath84 in the defect - free case , @xmath74 , is unbounded while in the presence of the defect with @xmath127 , the existence curve becomes bounded . considering the case",
    "@xmath76 the soliton at @xmath104 and @xmath74 has the same number of particles as the defect mode at @xmath128 and @xmath127 ( see the lower horizontal dotted line in the left panel of fig.[q_1_g_v ] ) . to check this we calculated the defect mode for @xmath128 in the presence of the defect and compared it with the defect mode obtained by direct dynamical calculation where the initial soliton for @xmath104 and @xmath74 has the same number of particles as the defect mode . in the right panel of fig.[q_1_g_v ] we compare these two defect modes ( time @xmath129 corresponds to the instant when @xmath130 during interaction of the soliton with the defect ) .",
    "in the case @xmath84 the situation is different .",
    "the number of particles in the soliton at @xmath104 and @xmath74 is below the critical number of particles , @xmath83 , needed to generate the defect mode in the presence of the defect ( there is no intersection of the horizontal dotted with the upper dashed line ) . in this case",
    "one can observe splitting of the soliton into two linear wave packets after interaction with the defect .",

    "tuning the dipolar interactions in quantum gases can be achieved using for example time dependent control of the anisotropy of dipolar interactions suggested in @xcite . as it was shown in section 4.1 , in the presence of the attractive local and the repulsive nonlocal interaction",

    "as one can see in the former case there is no delocalization transition and the solution remains localized , while in the latter case at some instant the norm of the solution becomes smaller then the critical norm @xmath83 and the norm of the solution any more pretends to the existence curve and therefore the solution decays into linear waves .",
    "returning to the initial value @xmath139 in the first case the solution reconstructs its initial form while in the second case it remains delocalized .",
    "now let us consider the opposite situation when the solitonic structure is supported by an attractive nonlocal interaction @xmath93 and the local interaction is repulsive , @xmath140 .    in fig.[fig11 ] the corresponding initial profile of the nonlocal soliton in the parabolic trap with defect",
    "as in the previous case the shift from the center of the trap is needed to observe oscillations of the solitons and eventual interaction with defect placed in the center of the trap .",
    "two simple scenarios of the interaction of the soliton with the defect in the case of a strong parabolic trap are shown in fig.[q-05](a ) , ( c ) . in the first case",

    "as one can see the pure dipolar soliton does not present very robust dynamics , what can be explained by the weak force of the nonlocal interaction .",
