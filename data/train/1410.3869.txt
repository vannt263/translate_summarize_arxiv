    "the promise of a phase transition at finite temperature in qcd from the confined hadronic phase to a deconfined quark - gluon phase has triggered a lot of activity both theoretically as well as experimentally .",
    "this original prediction by early lattice calculations  @xcite has turned into a smooth crossover after many years of accumulated experience  @xcite . the determination and understanding of the qcd equation of state ( eos ) from the lattice  @xcite plays a crucial role in the current analysis of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .    while in the limit of massless",
    "quarks the qcd lagrangian is scale invariant , implying a vanishing trace of the energy momentum tensor , the symmetry is broken explicitly by the finite quark masses and anomalously by the necessary renormalization which introduces a energy scale and generates a trace anomaly .",
    "the most recent up - to - date results for 2 + 1 flavor lattices have been obtained by the wuppertal - budapest(wb )  @xcite and hotqcd  @xcite collaborations and after continued discrepancies there is a final consensus that maximal violation of scale invariance occurs at @xmath0 where the trace anomaly reaches its maximum value .    at very high temperatures ,",
    "the typical momentum scales or @xmath1 are large and finite quark mass effects can be neglected . due to asymptotic freedom the strong and running coupling",
    "constant becomes small and thus interactions can be neglected .",
    "thus , one effectively has a gas of free and massless @xmath2 fermions ( quarks and anti - quarks ) and @xmath3 bosons ( gluons ) , and scale invariance is restored . at the same time",
    "colour is delocalized corresponding to a deconfined phase .",
    "this allows in principle to count the number of @xmath4 quark and @xmath3 gluon elementary species by means of the stefan - boltzmann law .",
    "current analyses show that this happens for temperatures much larger than @xmath5 .    yet",
    ", there is the firm belief that because of confinement , hadron states , composite , extended and most often unstable bound states made of quarks and gluons build a complete basis at very low temperatures , where they effectively behave as point - like , stable , non - interacting and structureless particles .",
    "this quark - hadron duality resembles to a large extent the similar duality between different degrees of freedom as the one found in deep inelastic scattering ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "it is remarkable that in the large @xmath6 limit some of these requirements are indeed fulfilled ( for a review see e.g.  @xcite ) , except and most notably the point - like character . of course , as the temperature is raised we expect many excited states to contribute , but also that finite width and finite size effects play a role .",
    "how this hadronization happens in detail has not really been understood so far .",
    "lattice calculations suggest that there is a smooth transition or crossover from the purely hadronic phase to the purely quark - gluon phase  @xcite . actually , it is not obvious when this hadronic picture fails in practice or what is the main mechanism behind quark and gluon liberation at the lowest possible temperature .",
    "the present contribution tries to address this problem guided by our own experience on the field .",
    "in the opposite limit of very low temperatures @xmath7 one expects an interacting gas of the lightest colour neutral particles ( for @xmath8 pions and kaons )  @xcite . because of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , the low - lying pseudoscalar particles are the lightest goldstone bosons made of @xmath9 quarks . for the typical low momenta in the heat bath",
    "@xmath10 goldstone bosons interact weakly through derivative couplings and hence interactions are strongly suppressed .",
    "thus scale invariance violations of the non - interacting gas are due to the finite pion and kaon masses .",
    "therefore , in the chiral limit of massless pseudoscalars scale invariance is also exact at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "because of the small signal , current lattice calculations of the trace anomaly are just above the edge of this pion and kaon gas , which is expected to work for @xmath11 .",
    "when the temperature is raised , hadronic interactions among pions start playing a role and two- and more particle states contribute to the thermodynamic properties .",
    "the calculation may be organized according to the quantum virial expansion  @xcite where there are two kinds of contributions .",
    "the excluded volume corrections come from repulsive interactions which prevent particles to approach each other below a certain distance .",
    "the resonance contributions stem from attractive interactions which generate states living long enough to produce pressure in the system , meaning that the resonance can hit the wall of the container before it decays .",
    "a well known example is @xmath12 scattering where one has attractive and resonating states in the isospin @xmath13 corresponding to the @xmath14 and @xmath15 resonances whereas one has a repulsive core in the @xmath16 exotic channel  @xcite providing a measure of the finite pion size .",
    "once a @xmath15 meson is created , it may interact with another pion and produce a resonance , @xmath17 ( which is a @xmath18 state ) and so on . for baryons ,",
    "the situation is similar where @xmath19 is a good example of a resonance contribution .",
    "this separation between attractive and repulsive contributions leaves out the residual interaction stemming from the background scattering .",
    "the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) corresponds to assume that all interactions among the lightest and stable particles can be described by an ideal gas of non - interacting resonances which are effectively pictured as stable , point - like and elementary particles , hence the trace anomaly is given by @xmath20 where the sum is over _ all _ hadronic states including spin - isospin and anti - particle degeneracies , @xmath21 for mesons and baryons respectively , @xmath22 is the energy and @xmath23 are the hadron masses . this collection of masses is usually called the _ hadron spectrum _ and",
    "most often identified with the pdg compilation which represents an established consensus among particle physicists  @xcite .",
    "the states classification echoes the non - relativistic quark model , namely mesons are @xmath24 states and baryons @xmath25 states .",
    "those falling outside this category are classified as `` further states '' .",
    "the hadron spectrum obtained from the pdg is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] as well as its separation into mesonic and baryonic spectra .",
    "the result of using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tran - hrg ] ) with the pdg states  @xcite compared to the continuum extrapolated results of the wuppertal - budapest ( wb )  @xcite and hotqcd  @xcite collaborations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trace - pdg ] .",
    "it is amazing that this exceedingly simple picture works _",
    "accurately _ almost below @xmath5 ( the maximal scale - violating temperature ) at about @xmath26 . note that the lowest lattice data points at @xmath27 are first saturated when states with masses above the vector mesons are included .",
    "higher temperatures start feeling excited hadronic states , which by their nature embody relativistic dynamics .",
    "the quantum statistical bosonic and baryonic character of the states accounts by less than @xmath28 correction to the classical maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( corresponding to take @xmath29 ) at about @xmath30 , already well beyond the range where lattice and hrg agree and much smaller than the lattice @xmath31 uncertainties .",
    "the transition from hadrons to quarks has been analyzed on the light of strangeness  @xcite and an observable which vanishes for the hrg has been proposed .",
    "actually , the hrg model has arbitrated the discrepancies between the different collaborations in the past and the lattice community have had a long struggle until agreement _ between them _ and _ with the hrg model _ has been declared . while this has made the hrg model a sort of holy grail ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , it is good to remind that despite of the phenomenological success it is not a theorem , nor a well defined approximation from the original qcd lagrangian .",
    "the most compelling argument is that it is to date unclear how corrections to this simple approach should be implemented nor what the error estimate for the hrg should be . for a comparison",
    ", we also show the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tran - hrg ] ) using instead the relativized quark model ( rqm )  @xcite which essentially combines two basic elements , the static energy among the constituents and a relativistic form of the kinetic energy which does not consider the spin of the particles but does not contain more parameters than qcd itself . the likewise impressive agreement of the rqm trace anomaly with the lattice data not only illustrates our point on the lack of uniqueness of what is actually being checked by these comparisons , but also that the rqm may provide information not listed in the pdg booklet .",
    "for instance , the pdg lists the quantum numbers , decay modes , masses and widths of the resonances building the hadron spectrum , but no information on their size is provided . while for unstable particles",
    "this is a problematic issue ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , within the heavy - ion literature the assumption of a constant volume is frequently made ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this information can be accessed by means of quark models or lattice calculations . on the other hand , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the purely resonance character makes the very definition of the mass ambiguous , and this allows to generate an error band on the pdg prediction of the hrg model which gives a spread for the trace anomaly about half the lattice uncertainties .",
    "as a guideline , let us provide some of the main features of qcd at finite temperature emphasizing some relevant aspects for the discussion .",
    "many gaps in this sketchy presentation may be filled by consulting e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the qcd lagrangian ( in euclidean spacetime ) is given by @xmath32 the qcd lagrangian is invariant under colour gauge transformations @xmath33 the qcd thermodynamics is obtained from the partition function @xmath34 { \\rm det } ( i \\gamma_{\\mu } d_{\\mu } - m_f ) \\ , , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the periodic or anti - periodic boundary conditions for gluons and quarks respectively @xmath35 where the matsubara frequencies are @xmath36 for gluons and",
    "@xmath37 for quarks .",
    "preservation of the quark antiperiodic boundary conditions implies that only periodic gauge transformations are allowed , namely @xmath38 within the convenient polyakov gauge ( @xmath39 stationary and everywhere diagonal @xcite ) the most general remaining transformation is either stationary and diagonal or of the type @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "large gauge invariance implies periodicity in @xmath43 with period @xmath44 @xmath45 this is the finite temperature version of the gribov copies , i.e. , the fact that there is no complete gauge fixing in a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "a drastic consequence of this periodicity property is that it becomes explicitly broken in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "thus , we may consider this as a signal of the relevance of non - perturbative finite temperature gluons .    in the limit of massless quarks ( @xmath46 )",
    "the qcd lagrangian is scale invariant , i.e. @xmath47 .",
    "this symmetry is broken by quantum corrections due to the necessary regularization . to see this",
    "consider the partition function dependence on the coupling constant @xmath48 after the rescaling of the gluon field @xmath49 ( and ignoring renormalization issues ) @xmath50 { \\rm det } ( i \\gamma_{\\mu } d_{\\mu } ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the _ only _ dependence on @xmath48 is the one shown explicitly .",
    "thus , @xmath51 where in the last equation we have assumed a vacuum space time independent configuration , with @xmath52 the volume of the system . on the other hand",
    "the free energy and internal energy are given by the thermodynamic relations @xmath53 and the trace anomaly becomes @xmath54 generally , a renormalization scale @xmath55 has to be introduced to handle both ir and uv divergences .",
    "thus , on purely dimensional grounds one has @xmath56 physical results should not depend on the renormalization scale , thus using that @xmath57 we get @xmath58 introducing the beta function @xmath59 the trace anomaly becomes then @xmath60 where @xmath61 here we have implemented , in full harmony with standard lattice practice ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , a subtraction to renormalize the vacuum contribution @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the trace anomaly at zero temperature is consistent with quark - hadron duality , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tran - hrg ] ) .",

    "the divergence of the free energy of a colour charge in the fundamental representation is interpreted as a signal for confinement @xcite .",
    "the renormalization of the polyakov loop is a subtle issue addressed in the lattice in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in gluodynamics",
    "the center symmetry is spontaneously broken above a critical temperature and @xmath84 approaches unity ( or any other central element ) as the temperature increases .",
    "in fact , at high temperatures @xmath85 and one may expand  @xcite , @xmath86 note that while this formula suggests that @xmath87 , the renormalization overshoots this value at a perturbative level in a tiny but visible way  @xcite .",
    "in full qcd the center symmetry is explicitly broken , which results in @xmath88 at all temperatures . in the limit of heavy quarks and low",

    "we note , however , that the spectrum for the rqm saturates sharply at @xmath163 which is about the cut - off mass where isgur , godfrey and capstick stopped to compute states . on the other hand , the pdg states saturates at lower energy values in a softer fashion .",
    "note that the rqm looks like a linear extrapolation ( mind the log scale ) of the pdg spectrum .",
    "the agreement at lower masses is not highly surprising since rqm parameters were tuned to reproduce low lying states on the one side _ and _ the listed pdg states fit into the quark model scheme on the other side . on the other hand",
    ", there are only @xmath14 and the @xmath9 quark masses as fitting parameters , so we should regard the agreement as a further big success of the rqm from a global point of view .",

    "however , it is unclear if there are missing or redundant states although the consensus of listing states fitting into the quark model makes this argument into a circular one .",
    "of course , the meaning of @xmath171 and @xmath172 is different .",
    "while in the pdg listing we usually encounter a breit - wigner resonance parameterization characterized by a mass and a width , in the rqm we have just the mass of a bound @xmath173 or @xmath25 state .",
