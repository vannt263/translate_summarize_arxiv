    "the singularity theorems of general relativity tell us that , under generic conditions , spacetime singularities _ will _ form . from the study of solutions to einstein s equations",
    "we have learned that spacelike singularities arise in two physical situations : in cosmological scenarios where we associate them with either the big bang or the big crunch , and in the interior regions of event horizons , that is , inside black holes . just as in the cosmological scenario ,",
    "flrw cosmological spacetimes are taken as paradigmatic examples of space - times possessing a singularity , the schwarzschild spacetime is the standard example of those singularities of the second kind . the standard interpretation within general relativity , when such singularities appear , is that the description one is using of the physical situation breaks down ; general relativity is no longer valid . in terms of physical quantities , such as geometric scalars ,",
    "these singularities are manifest when some of such quantities grow un - boundedly .",
    "one can therefore expect that in these physical situations , quantum gravitational effects will take over and become dominant .",
    "the problem is that we do not yet possess a complete theory that describes such quantum phenomena .",
    "a very conservative approach is to apply ` standard ' quantization techniques to highly symmetric classical configurations , such as homogeneous spacetimes in the cosmological context and for the interior of black holes .",
    "this is the strategy that we shall consider in this manuscript .",
    "since the interior ( black hole ) schwarzschild solution can be seen as a particular example of a contracting anisotropic kantowski - sachs model , one natural question is to consider its quantization with the aim of probing what the fate of the final classical singularity may be .    in recent years , new quantization techniques",
    "have been applied to these minisuperpace scenarios .",
    "these techniques , motivated by loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite , are based on non - regular representations of the canonical commutation relations that make these quantum systems inequivalent to the standard schrdinger representation , already at the kinematical level . in the cosmological scenario",
    "the resulting formalism is known as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite .",
    "the main features that distinguishes these quantum minisuperspace models from the standard wheeler - de witt ( wdw ) models is that , for simple systems , the singularity is generically avoided and the quantum evolution continues past the ` would be singularity ' in a unitary way @xcite .",
    "these contrasting features have been rigorously understood via various analytical @xcite and numerical investigations in lqc @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether similar results emerge when these technique are applied to the schwarzschild interior .",
    "the pioneer work that embarked on this task was ref .",
    "@xcite , and several other works followed @xcite .    unlike the regular representations , where the stone - von neumann theorem warranties uniqueness ( up to unitary equivalence ) , within the realm of loop quantizations ( sometimes referred also as ` polymer quantizations ' ) , there are infinite inequivalent representations of the quantum constraints . in simple cases , this freedom translates into the liberty of choosing the basic variables for the quantization . in the original treatment of the black hole interior @xcite",
    ", the strategy followed a particular quantization of isotropic flrw models @xcite .",
    "as in the early quantization of cosmological models in lqc , the quantizations of black hole spacetime given in refs .",
    "@xcite suffer from lack of independence of the the auxiliary structure , such as the ` size ' of the fiducial cell , needed for the hamiltonian description .",
    "this results in spurious quantum gravitational effect at ultra - violet and infra - red scales @xcite .",
    "further , in these quantizations singularity resolution can not be consistently identified with a curvature scale @xcite .",
    "a new proposal motivated by the ` improved quantization ' in lqc @xcite was put forward by bhmer and vandersloot @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "though this quantization is free from the auxiliary structure and results in universally bounded expansion and shear scalars @xcite , it has the following limitation .",
    "the quantization leads to ` quantum gravitational effects ' at the horizon due to the coordinate singularity .",
    "nevertheless , bhmer and vandersloot s prescription turns out to be free from these effects when the quantization of kantowski - sachs spacetime is performed in the presence of matter .",
    "interestingly , after the would - be singularity is avoided the spacetime corresponds to a ` charged ' nariai spacetime in bhmer and vandersloot s prescription @xcite , a conclusion which remains unchanged for the vacuum case and hence for the schwarzschild interior .",
    "given that the quantizations of black hole spacetimes based on the original lqc suffer from auxiliary structures dependence and the lack of a consistent singularity resolution scale , and the attempt based on ` improved quantization ' in lqc results in large ` quantum gravity effects ' at low curvatures near the horizon , none of the available quantizations of the schwarzschild interior in lqg can be deemed satisfactory .",
    "the purpose of this manuscript is to advance a new viewpoint to construct a quantization that is free from these limitations .",
    "the main new ingredient in the construction is the realization that , in order to define the hamiltonian formulation , it is necessary to introduce a physical length scale @xmath0 into the problem .",
    "this is a true scale that , in the classical limit , selects a unique classical solution and becomes nothing but the schwarzschild radius .",
    "this scale is to be contrasted with the auxiliary length @xmath1 that fixes the fiducial cell needed for defining the symplectic structure .",
    "the latter being an auxiliary structure has no physical significance and should be absent in the final quantum theory .",
    "the proposal that we shall describe in detail is motivated by recent considerations regarding the loop quantization of symmetry reduced models @xcite .",
    "there , it was proposed that rather natural physical criteria be used to select various choices in the quantization procedure .",
    "in particular one should require that the final quantum theory be independent of any auxiliary structure , have a well defined high curvature regime and recover the classical theory at low curvatures .",
    "in the case of the black hole interiors , no such construction exists to date .",
    "here we are able to construct a quantum theory that satisfies all these criteria and , even when it resembles the original treatment of @xcite , it possesses subtle and important differences .",
    "these are manifested in the inputs necessary for regulating the curvature in the hamiltonian constraint using holonomies which capture the fundamental discrete nature of the underlying quantum geometry .",
    "we notice that different prescriptions need to be specified for the two anisotropic directions , with distinct dependence on the two scales at hand , namely the ( new ) physical scale @xmath0 and the auxiliary @xmath1 .",
    "this subtle difference makes the resulting quantum theory singularity free and independent of @xmath1 , thus removing dependence on any auxiliary structure .",
    "a study of the semiclassical ` effective dynamics ' also shows that there are no spurious quantum gravity effects appearing at low curvatures . from this viewpoint , this represents the first fully consistent quantization for black hole interiors using loop quantization methods which has a well defined and consistent ultra - violet regime where the singularity resolution occurs , and which is in agreement with general relativity in the infra - red limit .",
    "it should be noted that we arrive at this description without invoking ideas from improved dynamics of lqc which involved a subtle change of the original discretization variable .",
    "the classical singularity is avoided , and replaced by a ` quantum bounce ' to a new branch .",
    "the spacetime does not end at the singularity .",
    "an interesting feature of the effective spacetime that arises after the bounce is that it represents the ( expanding ) interior region of a white hole , but of a different mass than the original black hole .",
    "furthermore , there appears to be a cubic powerlaw relation between the two sets of masses .",
    "it should be noted that the difference in the white hole mass and the starting black hole mass is also present in the ashtekar - bojowald prescription as was first shown in ref .",
    "but , there is a striking difference in physics in comparison to our analysis . unlike the quantization introduced in this manuscript , the white hole mass in the ashtekar - bojowald prescription depends on the fiducial length @xmath1 , and not on the starting black hole mass .",
    "thus , while the white hole mass in our prescription is proportional to the cubic power of the initial black hole mass and independent of any fiducial structure , in the ashtekar - bojowald prescription it can take any arbitrary value through its @xmath1 dependence .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we recall the classical minisuperspace in terms of connections and triads that we are considering and introduce the main assumption underlying the construction of the quantum theory .",
    "[ sec:3 ] is devoted to the study of the classical solution for the equations and their space - time interpretation . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we consider the loop quantization of these models and arrive at a quantum difference equation that selects the physical states of the theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] we consider the effective dynamics one expects to recover from the quantum theory and study its phenomenological implications . here",
    "we discuss the boundedness of expansion and shear scalars in the effective spacetime description when the would - be central singularity is approached .",
    "we show the independence of the physics on the underlying fiducial structures and discuss the relationship between the starting black hole mass and the white hole mass .",
    "we conclude the article with a summary of results and a discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] .",
    "the portion of the schwarzschild spacetime corresponding to the interior region of the black hole can described by a homogeneous cosmological model given by a kantowski - sachs geometry with symmetry group @xmath2 .",
    "this corresponds to a foliation in which the 3-manifolds with topology @xmath3 approach a null - surface , the horizon , on the past and a space - like singularity on the future . as in the previous cases studied within minisuperspace hamiltonian formulation , it is a standard procedure to define a fiducial metric @xmath4 on the 3-manifold @xmath3 and define the corresponding compatible triad @xmath5 and co - triad @xmath6",
    "however , unlike the isotropic and homogeneous flrw and bianchi - i models , there is only one non - compact direction and thus one has to introduce a line interval @xmath1 as an auxiliary structure to define the phase space .",
    "the choice of fiducial metric that we will here make , even when rather similar to that of @xcite ( and used in all subsequent articles @xcite ) is , however , motivated by different considerations . in @xcite , the fiducial metric on the sphere was chosen to be a unit sphere .",
    "even when this choice is mathematically consistent , one needs to specify a scale , in this case with dimensions of area that , together with the dimension - full coordinate @xmath7 , yield a fiducial metric with consistent dimensions .",
    "the viewpoint that we shall adopt here is that , in order to perform a hamiltonian analysis in the absence of a natural scale in gr , one has to specify it externally _ as a boundary condition_. this situation is not new in black hole physics .",
    "for instance , as part of the definition of an _ isolated horizon _",
    "@xcite , one has to specify the precise values of all the multipole moments of the horizon . for the simplest case of spherical horizons ( of type i in the standard terminology )",
    ", this means fixing the value of the area @xmath8 of the horizon .",
    "the classical hamiltonian theory is thus dependent on this external parameter , and this is carried over to the quantum regime .",
    "our concrete proposal is to extend this viewpoint to the formalism that we are here considering , and fix a classical scale by asking that the area @xmath8 of @xmath9 be equal to @xmath10 .",
    "the fiducial metric takes the form : s_o^2:=x^2 + r^2_o(^2 + ^2",
    "^ 2 ) with determinant @xmath11 .",
    "this externally prescribed length scale will turn out to be the schwarzschild radius , thus providing a physical parameter that defines the configurations under consideration .",
    "namely , just as in the analysis of entropy for isolated horizons where one chooses a given fixed area from the start , the system under consideration here will be the dynamics of a kantowski - sachs cosmology with the interpretation of being the interior region of a black hole of a given area @xmath8 . in practical terms , this does not represent a limitation , since at the end of the day one can let @xmath8 become a free parameter , so we have a description of all possible black hole interiors .",
    "we have been careful in explaining the role of @xmath0 since it represents the main conceptual difference from other treatments , and the one that will allow for a consistent formulation .    in order to define the symplectic structure",
    ", one has to specify a finite interval for the coordinate @xmath7 in @xmath12 .",
    "the usual procedure is to restrict the range of @xmath7 to the interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "with this choice the fiducial volume of the fiducial cylinder is equal to @xmath14 . with our choices ,",
    "this quantity has the ` right dimensions ' of volume .    utilizing the symmetries of the spacetime ( and after imposing the gauss constraint ) , the connection and the triad can be written as follows @xcite : a^i_a _ i x^a = |c _ 3 x + |br_o _ 2 - |b r_o _ 1 + _ 3 and e^a_i ^i x^a = |p_c r_o^2 _ 3 x + |p_b r_o _ 2 - |p_b r_o _ 1   with fiducial triad and cotriad : ^oa^i_a _ i x^a = _ 3 x + r_o _ 2 - r_o _ 1 + _ 3 and ^oe^a_i ^i x^a = r_o^2 _ 3 x + r_o _ 2 - r_o _ 1  .",
    "the metric for the particular case of the schwarzschild interior spacetime is s^2 = - n^2 t^2 + |p_b^2||p_c| x^2 + ||p_c|r_o^2 ( ^2 + ^2 ^2 )   thus @xmath15 and @xmath16 are related to components of the standard schwarzschild metric as    @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the adm mass of the spacetime .",
    "the triads @xmath19 and @xmath20 are dimensionless , the latter being equal to unity at the horizon by the choice of parameter @xmath0 ( with dimensions of mass parameter ) : @xmath21 . the symplectic structure expressed in terms of the conjugate pairs @xmath22 and @xmath23 is not invariant under the change of fiducial metric .",
    "we can introduce [ cbpair ] c = l_o",
    "|c ,   p_c = r_o^2|p_c ,   b = r_o|b ,   p_b = r_ol_o |p_b which satisfy [ pbs ] \\{c , p_c } = 2 g ,   \\{b , p_b } = g  .",
    "there are two underlying freedoms associated with auxiliary structures of which the theory should be invariant .",
    "the redefinition ( [ cbpair ] ) takes care of the freedom to rescale coordinates ( for eg .",
    "@xmath24 ) keeping the metric invariant .",
    "however , freedom to rescale size of the interval of integration @xmath1 exists , and as in the cosmological model one of the primary tasks will be to identify suitable variables for the phase space . under the rescaling of @xmath25 : [ schw_trans ] c c = c , & &   p_c p_c = p_c ,   + b b = b , & &   p_b p_b = p_b  . note that in our model , there is no underlying freedom to change @xmath0 . as stated before it amounts to considering a different physical situation .",
    "this is quite different from the quantity @xmath26 that is an auxiliary ( and arbitrary ) construct with no physical meaning .",
    "the classical hamiltonian constraint in terms @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be written as @xcite [ h_cl ] c _ = - 8 n ( p_c)^2((b^2 + ^2 ) p_b + 2 b c |p_c|^1/2 )  .",
    "it is related to the classical hamiltonian as : @xmath29 .",
    "choosing @xmath30 in @xmath31 and using ( [ pbs ] ) , we can find the equations of motion for the phase space variables : = -(b+^2b ) ,   _ b = ( 1-^2b^2 ) and = - 2c ,   _ c = 2 p_c   where the derivative is with respect to ` time ' @xmath32 . integrating the equations for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 and using the constraint equation c = - ( b+^2b ) .",
    "we obtain [ class_sol_t ] p_b(t)&=&p_b^(o ) e^t , + p_c(t)&=&p_c^(o)e^2 t , + b(t)&= & +   c(t ) & = & c_oe^-2 t  .",
    "it is convenient to make a change of variables from dimensionless @xmath32 to dimensionfull @xmath36 , with @xmath37 as a length scale to be determined .",
    "we also identify the free parameter in @xmath33 and @xmath34 , denoted @xmath38 as @xmath39 . with this change of variables ,",
    "the solutions take the form : b(t ) & = &  , + p_b(t ) & = & + p_c(t)&=&t^2 +   c(t ) & = & m  .",
    "so far , we have four free parameters , two of which have to be fixed to end up with only two ( corresponding to the true degrees of freedom in the canonical formulation ) .",
    "the first simplification pertains to the freedom we have in choosing the initial time @xmath38 ( given that the constraint generates constant translations in @xmath32 , and one has to reduce this freedom ) .",
    "thus one can chose without losing generality @xmath40 which implies @xmath41 .",
    "since the schwarzschild radius , @xmath0 is a natural physical length scale in the model we further identify @xmath42 which implies @xmath43 , the mass parameter of the black hole .",
    "note that @xmath44 has the interpretation , in terms of the spacetime metric of the geometric radius of the homogeneous spheres .",
    "thus , we would like to associate the parameter @xmath45 with this quantity .",
    "this implies the choice @xmath46 . with these identifications",
    "the solutions can be rewritten as b(t ) & = &  , + p_b(t ) & = & , + p_c(t)&= & t^2 +   c(t ) & = & 2  .",
    "we are thus left with only two free quantities , namely @xmath47 .",
    "we further note that the spacetime metric only knows of the one independent parameter ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this can be seen by considering the @xmath49 component that is given by , g_xx & = & = ( -1 ) + & = & ( -1 ) , from which one can fix @xmath50 to be @xmath51 , in order to have the standard form of the line element .",
    "note that for any other choice of @xmath50 , say @xmath52 one could still bring the metric to the standard form by a constant rescaling of the coordinate @xmath7 by defining @xmath53 .",
    "is also rescaled by @xmath54 when changing coordinates .",
    "this illustrates the fundamental difference between the hamiltonian and the spacetime approaches to this system .",
    "this discussion corrects some statements of @xcite and @xcite that were based on a slightly different parametrizations . ]",
    "there is another way of solving the equations of motion that is illustrative to understand the behavior .",
    "first note that there is a natural constant of the motion given by @xmath55 ( in the standard terminology it is a dirac observable ) . with this identification",
    "we see that the hamiltonian constraint can be rewritten : h = p_b(b + ) , thus , we can interpret @xmath56 as a reduced hamiltonian that dictates the motion for the @xmath27 part of the phase space , that is decoupled from the @xmath28 sector .",
    "it is also a first integral that gives us the relational dynamics of @xmath34 as function of @xmath33 : p_b= there is only one free parameter in this dynamics , namely the value of @xmath56 . in the @xmath28 sector since @xmath57 , we only have to fix one constant ( for instance @xmath58 . ) .",
    "thus we recover the two degrees of freedom .",
    "it is now immediate to identify and interpret the dynamical evolution , with parameter @xmath45 ( or @xmath59 ) , in the phase space . for @xmath60 , that in the spacetime pictures represents the horizon",
    ", we have that @xmath61 and @xmath62 . as @xmath45 approaches zero , @xmath33 and @xmath63 grow unboundedly , and @xmath34 increases from @xmath64 to @xmath65 where it reaches its maximum value @xmath66 , and then becomes a monotonically decreasing function that approaches zero as @xmath67 .",
    "the elementary variables for the quantization are the holonomies of the connections @xmath63 ( considered over edges labelled by @xmath68 in @xmath7 direction ) and @xmath33 ( considered over edges labelled by @xmath69 in @xmath70 and @xmath71 directions ) [ hx ] h_x^ ( ) = ( c/2 ) + 2 _ 3 ( c/2 )  , [ htheta ] h_^ ( ) = ( b/2 ) + 2 _ 2 ( b/2 )   and [ hphi ] h_^ ( ) = ( b/2 ) - 2 _ 1 ( b/2 )  .",
    "the holonomies generate an algebra of the almost periodic functions with elements of the form @xmath72 and the resulting kinematical hilbert space is a space of square integrable functions on the bohr compactification of @xmath73:@xmath74 .",

    "let us consider two instances in which the ashtekar - bojowald quantization yields inconsistent predictions .",
    "the first one is the minimum value of @xmath35 which depends on @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "2 . as a consequence of all this , the mass @xmath147 of the white hole in our analysis turns out to be independent of any fiducial structure .    in summary , the reason for the success of our present quantization , when compared to the ashtekar - bojowald quantization , is the subtle difference in the way field strength is regulated in the quantum theory .",
    "the fact that subtleties in the quantization prescription can have a deep impact on the physical predictions of the theory is not new .",
    "indeed , we have seen something rather similar in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "the old ( @xmath161 ) quantization in lqc shared similar problems as the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. unacceptable dependence of physics on auxiliary structures .",
    "it was cured by the introduction of the ` improved ' ( @xmath162 ) dynamics of lqc which resulted in change of the uniform discreteness variable from triad to volume @xcite . in the schwarzschild case ,",
    "no such change is needed . the quantum difference equation ( [ qde ] )",
    "is uniformly discrete in @xmath35 and @xmath34 as in the case of the earlier quantization @xcite .",
    "thus no refinement of the original lattice @xcite or ` improvement ' on the lines of lqc @xcite are required .",
    "all such ` improved ' schemes suffer from the problem of predicting `` quantum gravity '' effects at low curvatures near the coordinate singularity at the horizon .",
    "such unphysical effects near the horizon are absent in the present quantization .",
    "let us summarize our results .",
    "in the process of quantizing the schwarzschild interior , we have noted that an important step in the hamiltonian formulation was the understanding of the physical length scale @xmath0 from the very beginning .",
    "this scale corresponds , in the classical description , precisely to the natural length scale in the system , the schwarzschild radius .",
    "this simple modification has important ramifications . for ,",
    "in the heart of the loop quantization , namely in the replacement of curvature by finite holonomies , there are two unequal parameters @xmath148 and @xmath149 . the former depending on @xmath0 and the latter on the auxiliary length scale @xmath1 . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting hamiltonian operator is invariant under the change of fiducial cell . in this respect ,",
    "the quantization found here can be seen as a refinement of that in ref .",
    "in particular , it reduces to that one when the parameter in each direction are set to be equal .",
    "an important feature of the resulting quantum constraint is that it is perfectly regular at the ` would be singularity ' .",
    "physics does not stop there .    even when we do not have a physical hilbert space and dirac operators thereon",
    ", one can expect that effective equations describe the unitary evolution of appropriate semiclassical states , as happens in multiple examples within the isotropic sector .",
    "we have analysed in detail these effective equations and found interesting dynamics . in the relevant variable chosen the ` initial condition ' is given by the model universe ( of spatial topology @xmath163 ) approaching a null surface , that in the schwarzschild solution corresponds to the ( black hole ) event horizon . the homogeneous hypersurfaces contract as they would in schwarzschild but , instead of reaching zero area in a finite proper time ( the singularity ) , the spheres reach a minimum value of area and ` bounce back ' , approaching a different constant value in the asymptotic future . this asymptotic value",
    "( that could be called the mass of a white hole ) only depends on the mass of the original black hole and does not depend on the other degree of freedom available in the hamiltonian description , nor on any fiducial structure .",
    "analysis of the solutions of the effective equations show that the mass of the white hole is proportional to the cube of the starting black hole mass . in both asymptotic past and future , where the classical horizons might arise ,",
    "the dynamics from the effective hamiltonian approximates the classical dynamics .",
    "thus , there are no spurious quantum gravity effects appearing where one does not expect them .",
    "our quantization represents the first one possessing all these features .",
    "further , analysis of the expansion and shear scalars shows that they are dynamically bounded on the approach to the classical singularity and are free from the rescaling of fiducial structures .",
    "these results stand in striking contrast to the resulting physics derived from the effective description of the ashtekar - bojowald quantization where the white hole mass , and the expansion and shear scalars depended on the fiducial length @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we would like to end this note with two remarks .",
    "+ _ relation with the information loss issue . _",
    "the singularity resolution found in ref .",
    "@xcite gave support to the paradigm proposed in @xcite about black hole evaporation and information loss ( further support comes from work in the cghs model @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea is that the scenario in which a black hole looses mass via hawking radiation and evaporates is based in the assumption that there exists a singularity inside the event horizon .",
    "if , as ( loop ) quantum gravity effects suggest , there is no singularity , then one has to conclude that there was no event horizon to begin with and one has to extend the arena on which to describe the physical process , from the standard one with a future singularity to some ` quantum spacetime ' containing no singularity .",
    "what can we say from our present study regarding this issue ?",
    "the problem we have analysed is posed with the initial conditions corresponding to a space - like surface ` just inside ' the event horizon of the schwarzschild spacetime , and through dynamical evolution , after the bounce the asymptotic geometry to the future approaches that of a space - like surface ` just inside ' a white - hole horizon of a different mass .",
    "while in the restricted sense of our analysis ( vacuum and therefore no backreaction of matter ) , one obtains a different asymptotic region to the future , one can not conclude that the new paradigm does not hold . in order to settle this question",
    ", one would need a more complete treatment , including radiating matter , and an extension to the exterior region of the horizon .",
    "it is only with that more complete description that one might hope to give meaning to the ` effective spacetime ' that arises from the solution to our effective equations , in terms of the ashtekar - bojowald paradigm @xcite .",
    "in particular it should be clear that from the perspective of a complete non - singular quantum state , statements like ` the mass of the initial black hole ' or ` final white hole ' might become meaningless .",
    "needless to say , a lot of work in this direction is needed , and our present analysis can only be seen as a first step in that direction .",
    "+ _ relation to @xmath164 gravity .",
    "_ in several instances , it has been useful to relate 3 + 1 symmetric spacetimes , via the geroch reduction , to @xmath164 gravity coupled to a massless scalar field @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "this equivalence has been exploited to study the quantum theory of einstein rosen waves @xcite and polarized gowdy models @xcite . for the kantowski - sachs model under consideration here , this strategy is also a possibility that one might consider . to be precise , we have for the schwarzschild interior all the ingredients needed in such reduction , namely , a killing field @xmath166 that is hypersurface orthogonal ( to the @xmath167constant surfaces ) .",
    "thus , any kantowski - sachs space - time ( in vacuum ) is equivalent to a spherically symmetric gravitational field @xmath168 on a 3d spacetime with topology @xmath169 , coupled to a mass - less spherically symmetric scalar field @xmath165 .",
    "the scalar field is proportional to the logarithm of the norm of @xmath170 ( given by @xmath49 ) .",
    "if we analyse the system from this perspective we see that the 3d ricci curvature @xmath171 ( and energy density of the scalar field as defined by the 3d energy momentum tensor @xmath172 ) diverge at both the @xmath173 singularity and at the horizon where @xmath60 .",
    "the spurious curvature singularity at the horizon of the 3d metric @xmath174 disappears once we go back to the @xmath175 description by means of the conformal transformation that relates both metrics and that in this case ` cures ' the singularity , yielding a finite 4d curvature at the horizon .",
    "it is to be noted that any quantization that was build from the @xmath164 perspective and that was successful in ` curing ' this 3d singularity would be , however , physically inadequate from the 4d perspective , where no classical singularity exists .",
    "in fact , what one might conclude is that the ` improved ' schemes of @xcite and @xcite are somewhat tailored to curing this 3d singularity as well , as can be seen from the fact that spurious quantum gravity effects appear near the horizon .",
    "in retrospect , this is not the first instance in which the classical equivalence between 4d symmetric models and @xmath164 gravity @xmath176 scalar field faces some difficulties in the quantum realm . in the case of polarized gowdy models ,",
    "the resulting quantization that used this equivalence in a fundamental way does not possess a unitary time evolution @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that no such quantization exists for that field parametrization @xcite . in order to have a consistent , unitary",
    ", description one needs to take the 4d character of the problem at face value and find a suitable parametrization that does not admit a @xmath164 interpretation @xcite .",
