    "the entangled photon pairs produced in spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) have been used in a range of experiments to demonstrate non - local correlations in quantum mechanics . in this paper",
    "we examine the results of one such experiment , in which yoon - ho kim and yanhua shih obtain an apparent violation of the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "their experiment is the modern realization of a thought experiment created by karl popper in the early 1930 s to illustrate his doubts about the uncertainty principle @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "although his proposal was flawed because of its reliance on a stationary point source , which is itself forbidden by the uncertainty principle @xcite , kim and shih have recreated the essence of popper s experiment without this problem using spdc and a converging lens .",
    "surprisingly , their experimental data appears to show a violation of the uncertainty principle in agreement with popper s original prediction .    after a review of kim and shih s experiment",
    ", we investigate the validity of the uncertainty principle when dealing with entangled systems and conditional measurements . in light of this",
    ", we then look more closely at their experiment and offer an alternative explanation for the results . as with popper s original experiment",
    ", we will show that the width of the source plays a crucial role .",
    "as explained in @xcite , kim and shih s experiment is conceptually equivalent to the `` unfolded '' schematic given in fig .",
    "[ unfolded_diagram ] , in which an spdc source , lens and slits all lie on a common @xmath0-axis .",
    "the central converging lens ( of focal length 500 mm ) is positioned 255 mm from the spdc source and 1000 mm from each of two parallel slits ( a and b ) , with slit b closest to the source .",
    "pairs of entangled photons are generated at the source by an external pump - laser , and their trajectories are measured on either side of the slits by detectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "a collecting lens is used to channel light passing through slit a into the fixed detector @xmath1 , while @xmath2 is scanned along the @xmath3-axis 500 mm behind slit b. the results are then combined in a coincidence circuit to yield a conditional measurement:_the y coordinate of photon 2 in the plane of @xmath2 given that photon 1 passes through slit a and is detected at @xmath1 . _ two cases are studied ; ( i ) in which slit b is the same width as slit a ( 0.16 mm ) , and ( ii ) , in which slit b is wide open .",
    "although the photons are created with a large uncertainty in position and momentum there are strong correlations between each pair due to the phase matching conditions of spdc . in this",
    "`` unfolded '' schematic the momenta of the photons in each pair ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) are almost precisely anti - correlated , with @xmath6 .",
    "because of this , the two - photon trajectories are well represented by straight lines and may be treated like optical rays .",
    "we can construct a single - photon system which will generate approximately the same results as this experiment by replacing detector @xmath1 with a lamp and removing the spdc source , as shown in fig .",
    "[ simple_optical_fig ] .",
    "individual photons then propagate from the source at @xmath1 through the collection lens , slit a , the central lens , and slit b before being detected at @xmath2 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , results for this simple optical setup will be very similar to coincidence measurements in the spdc experiment .",
    "in particular , we expect a `` ghost image '' of slit a to be observed in coincidence measurements on the photon pair , just as a conventional image is visible in the single - photon setup , and this has been verified experimentally by pittman _",
    "_ @xcite .    by positioning both slits two focal lengths ( 1000 mm ) away from the lens",
    ", we can produce an unmagnified image of slit a in the plane of slit b , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the positions of slit a and its image relative to the lens , and @xmath9 is the focal length .",
    "@xmath10 gives an unmagnified solution . ] .",
    "if photon 1 passes through slit a and is detected at @xmath1 then photon 2 must pass through the image in the plane of slit b , as shown in fig .",
    "[ unfolded_diagram ] .",
    "the image slit should be the same width as slit a ( 0.16 mm ) , so one would not expect the behaviour of photon 2 to be affected if slit b is also narrowed to this width .",
    "however , according to kim and shih s results _ the momentum spread of photon 2 when slit b is narrowed is almost three times that when slit b is wide open . _",
    "it appears that the presence of a physical slit affects the results even though it does not change the spatial confinement of the photon .",
    "the momentum uncertainty of photon 2 in the image plane can be deduced approximately from the width of its spatial distribution at @xmath2 . in case ( i ) , with slit b narrowed to the same width as slit a ( 0.16 mm ) , the distribution at @xmath2 is @xmath11 mm wide .",
    "however , when slit b is wide open in case ( ii ) the width at @xmath2 is reduced to 1.6 mm . using simple geometrical arguments we obtain @xmath12 , where @xmath13 refers to the uncertainty in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) respectively .",
    "if we accept the above arguments and take the uncertainty in @xmath3 to be the same in both cases ( @xmath14 mm ) then there is significant reduction in @xmath15 , which suggests a violation of the uncertainty principle function generated by diffraction actually has an infinite standard deviation , and alternative measures of uncertainty and uncertainty relations are therefore required @xcite . ] .",
    "the uncertainty principle constrains the results of any measurement of non - commuting observables , and can be represented by the general inequality @xcite @xmath16 { | \\psi \\rangle } |,\\ ] ] which relates the standard deviations of observables @xmath17 and @xmath18 . if @xmath19 describes a system of several particles we can construct an inequality for the position @xmath20 and momentum @xmath21 of the @xmath22th particle , where @xmath23=i \\hbar$ ] .",
    "this yields a familiar heisenburg uncertainty relation for each particle in the system , regardless of any entanglement between them , @xmath24 however , many experiments on entangled systems actually probe conditional behaviour rather than single - particle properties . in kim and shih s experiment",
    "the crucial quantities are _ ` the position and momentum of photon 2 in the plane of slit b given that photon 1 is detected at @xmath1'_. can we still apply the uncertainty principle to such conditional quantities ?    to investigate this , we will consider a more general case : _ ` a measurement @xmath25 of one of two non - commuting observables @xmath17 or @xmath18 given that a measurement @xmath26 of @xmath27 obtains the result @xmath28'_.    if @xmath26 precedes @xmath25 , the situation is simple .",
    "first , measurement @xmath26 acts on @xmath19 according to the projection postulate , giving @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an operator which projects the system onto the eigenstate(s ) associated with result @xmath28 .",
    "the state will then undergo some unitary evolution into @xmath31 before measurement @xmath25 . as seen above ,",
    "the uncertainty principle is applicable to measurements on any quantum state , and will therefore constrain the results obtained in measurement @xmath25 in the normal way , with @xmath32 { | \\psi '' \\rangle } |.\\ ] ] if @xmath26 occurs after @xmath25 the situation is more complex , as the state on which @xmath26 acts will depend on which observable @xmath17 or @xmath18 was measured in @xmath25 and the result which was obtained .",
    "however , if @xmath19 represents a bi - partite system in which both sub - systems evolve independently , and @xmath26 and @xmath25 act on different sub - systems , then the results of @xmath25 will be bound by the uncertainty relation regardless of the time - ordering of @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",
    "in such cases , the evolution of sub - system 1 is decoupled from that of sub - system 2 and can be described by the operator @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the unitary time evolution operator for sub - system 1 , and @xmath35 is a time interval containing measurement @xmath25 . by tracing @xmath30 backwards in time",
    "we can rewrite this evolution as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 represents an equivalent projection before temporal evolution .",
    "a measurement @xmath26 which obtains the result @xmath28 _ after _",
    "measurement @xmath25 can therefore be replaced by a measurement @xmath38 obtaining @xmath39 ( with corresponding projector @xmath40 ) _ before _ measurement @xmath25 . because measurements on independent subsystems can always be shifted through time in this way",
    ", their ordering becomes irrelevant .",
    "we can always recast @xmath26 as a measurement preceding @xmath25 , and use the above arguments to apply the uncertainty principle to the results .    any conditional measurement in which @xmath26 and @xmath25 act on separately evolving subsystems will therefore be bound by the uncertainty principle . in kim and shih s experiment",
    "these subsystems are the two photons created during spdc , which do not interact with each other after their initial creation and must evolve independently between measurements when they are space - like separated .",
    "we are specifically interested in a measurement @xmath25 of the position @xmath41 or momentum @xmath42 of photon 2 in the plane of slit b given that a measurement @xmath26 on photon 1 detects it at @xmath1 . according to equation ( [ cond_uncertainty ] ) and the commutation relation @xmath43=i \\hbar$ ] , we expect photon 2 to obey the standard heisenburg relation @xmath44 even though @xmath3 and @xmath45 refer to conditional quantities , yet the results of the experiment appear to violate this relation .",
    "the measured value of @xmath46 for the conditionally localised photon is approximately one third that for diffraction at a physical slit . to obey the uncertainty relation derived above",
    ", we would expect @xmath47 to be 2 - 3 times larger than the slit width to compensate for its reduced momentum spread . however , we know that the photon is confined to the unmagnified image of the slit , so @xmath47 should equal the slit width",
    ". how can we resolve this apparent paradox ?",
    "the answer lies in our assumption that the image is perfect . if we consider the blurring introduced by the finite width of the spdc source , we find that the image is actually 2 - 3 times larger than the physical slit , precisely as predicted by the uncertainty relation . narrowing slit",
    "b has a noticeable effect because it picks out the centre of the blurred image ( where a perfect image would lie ) , and thus alters the spatial confinement of the photon .",
    "the primary factor limiting image resolution is the width of the region in which photon pairs are created , given by the diameter of the laser beam pumping the spdc source ( @xmath48 mm ) .",
    "all photon trajectories must pass through the laser - pumped region because this is where photons are created during spdc , and we should account for this in our single - photon model . by replacing the spdc source with a 3 mm aperture only trajectories which pass through the source region will be carried over to the single - photon picture , and trajectories which lie outside the source region ( and therefore do not correspond to a valid two - photon trajectory ) will be eliminated . as we will see below , this intuitive step leads to a blurring of the image which explains the results without violating the uncertainty relation .    in terms of the spdc process",
    ", we can understand the same effect as a result of imperfect phase matching .",
    "the accuracy of the phase matching condition @xmath49 is limited by the uncertainty relations @xmath50 derived from equation ( [ general_uncertainty ] ) . as @xmath51 and @xmath52 are limited by the source width",
    ", the momenta of the photons in each pair can not be precisely anti - correlated , and representing their trajectories as straight lines through the source is only an approximation .",
    "it is by tracing these straight lines that we obtain a perfect image , so by disturbing them the uncertainty tends to cause blurring .    to understand the connection between the two approaches we equate @xmath53 and @xmath54 with the wavevector of a photon entering and leaving the source region respectively .",
    "taking @xmath55 as a measure of the source width , equation ( [ phase_match_eq ] ) then becomes @xmath56 , which indicates a diffraction - like disturbance at the source .",
    "a photon with a given incident wavevector @xmath57 will acquire a momentum spread @xmath58 on passing through the source which is characteristic of diffraction at a slit of width @xmath59 and is governed by the uncertainty relation @xmath60 . by replacing the spdc source with an appropriate slit in the single - photon system we are therefore simulating the effect of imperfect phase matching .",
    "the fact that both the single - photon and phase - matching approaches yield the same predictions highlights the power and universality of the uncertainty principle .",
    "we can estimate the width of the blurred image by treating the spdc source as a rectangular aperture in the single - photon system . using this simple model each point in the image",
    "is spread by convolution into a @xmath61 function of width ( between first minima ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the distance from source to image ( 745 mm ) , @xmath64 is the photon wavelength ( 702.2 nm ) and @xmath65 is the source width ( 3 mm ) .",
    "this gives a blurring of @xmath66 mm , which is more than double the expected width of the image ( 0.16 mm ) and is of the right magnitude to account for the reduction in momentum spread observed in the results for case ( ii ) .",
    "the accuracy of this analysis can be improved by using a slit profile which better represents the intensity of photon pair production in the spdc source , but the underlying result remains the same ; the narrower the source , the larger the blurring in the image and the greater @xmath47 .    the corresponding reduction in @xmath46 can be explained geometrically . for photons to travel from a source of width @xmath65 through a point - like image a distance @xmath63 ( @xmath67 ) away their trajectories must be bounded by the triangular region between the two , such that @xmath68 when combined with ( [ delta_y_eq ] ) and the de broglie relation @xmath69 this gives the uncertainty relation @xmath70 which is characteristic of single - slit diffraction at a rectangular aperture .    during the free evolution considered above , the momentum distribution of the photon is conserved . however , if slit b is narrowed to the same width as slit a ( 0.16 mm ) then only those photons passing through the centre of the blurred image will be detected at @xmath2 .",
    "this increased spatial confinement gives the photons a greater momentum spread and results in a broader pattern at @xmath2 , as observed in the results for case ( i ) .",
    "interestingly , if @xmath1 detects all photons passing through slit a , then we will _ only _ obtain a @xmath61 diffraction pattern in case ( i ) if the image is blurred .",
    "consider the wavefunction of the two - photon entangled system when photon 1 is in the jaws of slit a and photon 2 in the image where the two photons are effectively studied at different times ] ; @xmath71 the state of photon 2 is given by the reduced density matrix @xmath72 , which is actually an incoherent mixed state of the image points , @xmath73 each point in the image will therefore evolve with an infinite momentum spread and over the tracking range of @xmath2 results will be almost constant .",
    "it is only when the image points are blurred into coherent functions which spread over the width of slit b that a @xmath61 interference pattern will be obtained in the results .",
    "some of the coherence may also be restored if @xmath1 only detects a subset of the photons passing through slit a. this is a form of quantum erasure , in which information about which part of slit a the photon passed through is lost .",
    "in their paper , kim and shih correctly claim that their experiment does not violate the uncertainty principle , but we disagree with their explanation .",
    "they insist that the photons propagating towards @xmath2 _ are _ conditionally localised to within @xmath74 by the image of slit a , and that their reduced momentum spread in case ( ii ) is not a cause for concern because the uncertainty principle does not apply :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` a quantum must obey the uncertainty principle but the `` conditional behaviour '' of a quantum in an entangled two particle system is different .",
    "the uncertainty principle is not for conditional behaviour . ''",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in this paper , we have shown that the results of their experiment can be explained without this assertion .",
    "in fact , the uncertainty principle can be naturally extended to conditional measurements whenever they involve separately - evolving sub - systems , as is the case in their experiment .    as we have shown , blurring of the `` image '' not only explains the observed results without violating the uncertainty principle , but is actually _ a necessary consequence _ of the principle due to position - momentum uncertainty at the spdc source .",
    "to explain the diffraction patterns observed we actually require blurring to introduce coherent superpositions across the slit width , and give a finite momentum spread .",
    "the effect is analogous to that which blurs point - source images ( e.g. the image of a star ) in any lens system with a finite aperture ."
