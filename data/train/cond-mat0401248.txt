    "dynamics of open quantum systems has increasingly attracted @xcite the attention of the community of scientists in diverse fields , working on realizations of quantum information processing .",
    "recent interest in quantum computing has stimulated studies @xcite of environmental effects that cause small deviations from the isolated - system quantum dynamics . to perform large - scale quantum computation , environment - induced relaxation / decoherence effects during each short time interval of `` quantum - gate '' functions",
    "must be kept below a certain threshold in order to allow fault - tolerant quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the quantum system , with the environment traced out , is usually evaluated within some approximation scheme , e.g. , @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on an _ additive _ measure of the deviation of the density matrix of a several - qubit system from the `` ideal '' density matrix of the system @xcite .",
    "the latter would describe the `` ideal '' dynamics , i.e. , the system completely isolated from the environment . for a spin - boson model of a single two - state system ( a qubit ) , this measure is calculated explicitly for the environment modeled as a bath of harmonic modes @xcite , e.g. , phonons or photons .",
    "we also establish that for a several - qubit quantum system , the introduced measure of decoherence is approximately additive for the time scales of interest , i.e. , for short `` gate function '' times .",
    "the fact that this measure can be evaluated by summing up the deviation measures of the constituent qubits , which can be , in general , entangled , allows to avoid lengthy , tedious , and in most cases , intractable , many - body calculations .",
    "this new short - time additivity property is reminiscent of the approximate additivity expected for relaxation rates of exponential approach to equilibrium at large times , though the two properties are not related .",
    "let us briefly outline the commonly accepted scheme for implementing quantum algorithms in physical systems .",
    "the input data are encoded into the quantum states of several separated two - level systems ( qubits ) .",
    "then , their evolution is controlled by a hamiltonian consisting of single - qubit operators and of two - qubit interaction terms @xcite .",
    "parameters of the hamiltonian can be varied ( controlled ) externally to implement a given algorithm . in most quantum computer proposals @xcite this control",
    "is achieved by changing local electromagnetic fields around the qubits . of course",
    ", this ideal model does not include the influence of the environment on the computation , which necessitates quantum error correction .",
    "the latter involves inevitably the implementation of non - unitary measurement - type operations @xcite and can not be described as hamiltonian - governed dynamics of a closed system .",
    "to study the effect of the environment , one needs to choose a suitable model for the environmental and its coupling to the system of interest .",
    "the accepted approach to evaluate environmentally induced decoherence involves a model in which each qubit is coupled to a bath of environmental modes @xcite .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the system , with the bath modes traced out , then describes the time - dependence of the system evolution @xcite . due to the interaction with the environment , after each computational cycle the state of the qubits will deviate slightly from the ideal state .",
    "the deviation accumulates at each cycle , so that large - scale quantum computation is not possible without performing fault - tolerant error correction schemes @xcite .",
    "these schemes require the environmentally induced decoherence of the quantum state in one cycle to be below some threshold .",
    "the value of threshold , defined for uncorrelated single qubit error rates , was estimated @xcite to be between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    to study decoherence for a given system ,",
    "one should first obtain the evolution of its density matrix .",
    "this can be done by using various approximations @xcite . during each computational step the hamiltonian of the studied system",
    "is usually considered to be constant .",
    "the most familiar are the markovian - type approximations @xcite , used to evaluate approach to the thermal state at large times .",
    "it has been pointed out recently that these approximations are not suitable for quantum computing purposes because they are usually not valid @xcite at low temperatures and for short cycle times of quantum computation .",
    "several non - markovian approaches @xcite have been developed to evaluate the short - time dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "when one tries to study decoherence of several - qubit systems , additional difficulties should be taken into account .",
    "namely , one has to consider the degree to which noisy environments of different qubits are correlated @xcite .",
    "for example , if all constituent qubits are effectively immersed in the same bath , then there is a way to reduce decoherence for this group of qubits without error correction algorithms .",
    "the reduction of error rate can be achieved by encoding the state of one logical qubit in a decoherence free subspace of the states of several physical qubits @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a large scale quantum information processor consisting of many thousands of qubits , it is more appropriate to consider qubits immersed in distinct baths , because these errors represent the `` worst case scenario '' that necessitates error - correction .    after obtaining the density matrix @xmath2 for a single- or few - qubit system evaluated in some approximation",
    ", we have to compare it to the ideal density matrix @xmath3 corresponding to quantum algorithm without environmental influences .",
    "it is convenient to define some measure of decoherence to compare with the fault - tolerance criteria @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to have the measure nonnegative , and vanishing if and only if the system evolves in complete isolation . since explicit calculations beyond one or very few qubits are exceedingly difficult",
    ", it would be also useful to find a measure which is _ additive _ ( or at least sub - additive ) , i.e. , the measure of decoherence , @xmath4 of a composite system will be the sum ( or not greater than the sum ) of the measures of decoherence , @xmath5 , of its subsystems , @xmath6    in this work , we identify a measure of decoherence which has these desirable properties . in section [ dev ] , we give an overview of different methods for quantifying decoherence .",
    "we note that in some cases these numerical measures have oscillations on the time scales of the internal system frequencies , which do not reflect the nature of decoherence .",
    "therefore , in the next section [ d(t ) ] we define the norm that is subadditive for non - interacting initially unentangled qubits and in most cases is a monotonic function of time . to establish stronger properties of subadditivity of this norm even for initially entangled qubits",
    "we will use a more sophisticated diamond norm .",
    "it is defined in section [ k(t ) ] .",
    "relation between these norms and conditions for subadditivity for initially entangled qubits are also discussed . in section [ specific models ] , we consider a specific model of a qubit interacting with a bosonic bath of environmental modes . for two types of interaction",
    "we explicitly obtain norms @xmath4 and @xmath7 for one qubit and prove asymptotic _ additivity _ for short times , @xmath8 , @xmath9 this result should apply as a good approximation up to intermediate , inverse - system - energy - gap times @xcite , and it is consistent with the recent finding @xcite that at short times decoherence of a trapped - ion quantum computer scales approximately linearly with the number of qubits .",
    "typically , the total hamiltonian of an open quantum system interacting with environment has the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the internal system hamiltonian , @xmath12 is the hamiltonian of the environment ( bath ) , @xmath13 is the system - bath interaction hamiltonian . over gate - function cycles , and between them ,",
    "the terms in @xmath14 will be considered constant @xcite .",
    "therefore , the overall density matrix @xmath15 of the system and bath evolves according to @xmath16 here and in the following we use the convention @xmath17 .",
    "usually the initial density matrix is assumed @xcite to be a direct product of the initial density matrix of the system , @xmath18 , and the thermalized density matrix of the bath , @xmath19 , @xmath20 the reduced density matrix of the system is obtained by tracing out the bath modes , @xmath21    usually the environment is assumed to be a large macroscopic system in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath22 .",
    "interaction with it leads to thermalization of the quantum system , so that the reduced density matrix at large times approaches @xmath23    where @xmath24 .",
    "markovian type approximations which are used to quantify this process yield exponential decay of the density matrix elements in the energy basis of the hamiltonian @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath25 @xmath26 the shortest times among @xmath27 and @xmath28 are identified as characteristic times of thermalization @xmath29 and decoherence @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "thermalization of the quantum system requires the energy exchange with the environment while decoherence can include other faster processes without energy exchange .",
    "therefore , it is commonly believed @xcite that @xmath30 is much shorter than @xmath29 for low - temparature , well isolated from the environment systems appropriate for quantum computing realizations .",
    "the shorter time @xmath30 can be compared with @xmath31 needed for elementary quantum gate functions @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath32 must be small in order to satisfy fault - tolerance criteria @xcite .",
    "however , since @xmath30 is a large - time asymptotic property , other measures , representative of the short - time , @xmath33 , decoherence properties , are preferred for actual numerical evaluations @xcite .",
    "the exponential behavior of the density matrix elements inherent to the markovian approximation is valid on the time scale which is much larger than the internal inverse - system - energy - gap times of the quantum system . to measure effects of decoherence on these time",
    "scales one can use the entropy @xcite , @xmath34    or the idempotency defect , called also the first order entropy @xcite , @xmath35 both expressions are zero only if the quantum system density operator is a projector @xmath36 .",
    "any deviation from a pure state leads to the increase in the value of both measures .",
    "expressions ( [ s ] , [ s ] ) provide numerical measure of the system `` purity '' which does not rely on preferred basis .",
    "however , entropy measures do not distinguish different pure states .",
    "the next step in analyzing the effect of the interaction with the environment is to define the `` ideal '' ( without interaction ) density operator evolution according to @xmath37 one of the measures that characterizes decoherence in term of the difference between the `` real '' evolution , @xmath2 , and `` ideal '' one , @xmath38 , is the fidelity @xcite , @xmath39.\\ ] ] it is particularly useful when @xmath40 remains a projection operator ( pure state ) for all times @xmath41 , because it then attains the maximum value of 1 only when @xmath42 .",
    "an alternative way to quantify the effect of the interaction with the bath @xcite , is to consider the deviation , @xmath43 , @xmath44 of the reduced density matrix from the ideal one . as numerical measures of decoherence one can use the operator norm @xmath45 or trace norm @xmath46 .",
    "both norms are standard in in the theory of linear operators @xcite . for an arbitrary linear operator , @xmath47 ,",
    "these norms are defined as follows , @xmath48 @xmath49 for a finite - dimensional hermitian deviation operator ( [ deviation ] ) these definitions are equivalent to @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the eigenvalues of @xmath53 .    in the simplest case of a two - level system ( qubit ) ,",
    "the two norms are proportional to each other and given by @xmath54 the deviation norm @xmath55 has the minimal value , 0 , only for @xmath42 without any additional conditions .",
    "note that the measures @xmath55 and @xmath56 are not only functions of time , but also depend on the initial density operator @xmath18 . due to decoherence",
    ", they will deviate from zero for @xmath57 .",
    "however , their time - dependence will also contain oscillations at the frequencies of the internal system dynamics , as will be illustrated below for @xmath55 ; see @xcite and fig .  1 .",
    "in the next section we define the _ maximal _ deviation norm , @xmath58 , which is typically a monotonic function of time .",
    "to characterize decoherence for an arbitrary initial state , pure or mixed , we propose to use the maximal norm , @xmath4 , which is determined as an operator norm maximized over all the possible initial density matrices .",
    "for instance , we can define @xmath59    one can show that @xmath60 .",
    "this measure of decoherence will typically increase monotonically from zero at @xmath61 , saturating at large times at a value @xmath62 .",
    "the definition of the maximal decoherence measure @xmath58 looks rather complicated for a general multiqubit system .",
    "however , we will show that it can be evaluated in closed form for short times , appropriate for quantum computing , for a single - qubit ( two - state ) system .",
    "we then establish an approximate additivity that allows us to estimate @xmath58 for several - qubit systems as well .    in the superoperator notation the evolution of the reduced density operator of the system ( [ reduced ] ) and the one for the ideal density matrix ( [ ideal ] )",
    "can be formally expressed @xcite in the following way @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath22 , @xmath65 are linear superoperators . in this notation",
    "the deviation can be expressed as @xmath66\\rho(0).\\ ] ]    the initial density matrix can always be written in the following form , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 . here",
    "the set of the wavefunctions @xmath70 is not assumed to have any orthogonality properties .",
    "then , we get @xmath71\\left|\\psi_j\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\psi_j\\right|.\\ ] ] the deviation norm can thus be bounded , @xmath72   |\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|\\right\\|_{\\lambda}.\\ ] ] here @xmath73 is defined according to @xmath74   |\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|\\right\\|_{\\lambda}= \\max_j\\left\\|   \\left[t - t^{(i)}\\right ]   |\\psi_j\\rangle\\langle\\psi_j|\\right\\|_{\\lambda}.\\ ] ] it transpires that for any initial density operator which is a statistical mixture , one can always find a density operator which is pure - state , @xmath75 , such that @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , evaluation of the supremum over the initial density operators in order to find @xmath58 , see ( [ normd ] ) , one can done over only pure - state density operators .",
    "let us consider strategies of evaluation of @xmath58 for a single qubit .",
    "we can parameterize @xmath18 as @xmath77 where @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is an arbitrary @xmath80 unitary matrix , @xmath81 then , one should find a supremum of the norm of deviation ( [ n11 ] ) over all the possible real parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . as shown above",
    ", it suffices to consider the density operator in the form of a projector and put @xmath86 .",
    "thus , one should search for the maximum over the remaining three real parameters @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "another parametrization of the pure - state density operators , @xmath87 , is to express an arbitrary wave function @xmath88 in some convenient ortonormal basis @xmath89 , where @xmath90 .",
    "for a two - level system , @xmath91 where the four real parameters @xmath92 , with @xmath93 satisfy @xmath94 , so that the maximization is again over three independent real numbers . in the following sections , we will consider examples of evaluation of @xmath58 for single - qubit systems .    in quantum computing ,",
    "the error rates can be significantly reduced by using several physical qubits to encode each logical qubit @xcite . therefore , even before active quantum error correction is incorporated @xcite , evaluation of decoherence of several qubits is an important , but formidable task .",
    "consider a system consisting of two initially _ unentangled _",
    "subsystems @xmath95 and @xmath96 , with decoherence norms @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "we denote the density matrix of the full system as @xmath99 and its deviation as @xmath100 , and use a similar notation with subscripts @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the two subsystems .",
    "if the evolution of system is governed by the `` noninteracting '' hamiltonian of the form @xmath101 , where the terms @xmath102 , @xmath103 act only on variables of the system @xmath95 , @xmath96 , respectively , then the overall norm @xmath104 can be bounded by the sum of the norms @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath105 @xmath106    since the operator norm obeys the triangle inequality @xcite @xmath107 we can estimate the last expression as @xmath108 each eigenvalue of the tensor product of two linear operators is formed as a pairwise product of eigenvalues of the two operators .",
    "therefore , the operator norm of the tensor product of two operators is equal to product of their operator norms , @xmath109 we use this property and the fact that the eigenvalues of density matrices @xmath110 are in @xmath111 $ ] to derive the estimate @xmath112    in general , initially unentangled qubits will remain nearly unentangled for short times , because they did nt have enough time to interact .",
    "therefore , the inequality @xmath113 is expected to provide a good approximate estimate for the norm of a multiqubit system @xmath4 in terms of the norms @xmath114 calculated in the space of each individual qubit , i.e. , the measures of decoherence for the individual qubits can be considered _ approximately _ additive . for large times , the separate measures become of order 1 , so such a bound is not useful . instead , the _ rates _ of approach of various quantities to their asymptotic values are approximately additive in some cases .    in the rest of this work , we focus on the short - time and adiabatic ( i.e. , no energy exchange with the bath @xcite ) regimes , and establish a much stronger property",
    ": we prove the approximate additivity for the initially _ entangled _ qubits whose dynamics is governed by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the hamiltonian of the @xmath117th qubit itself , @xmath118 is the hamiltonian of the environment of the @xmath117th qubit , and @xmath119 is corresponding qubit - environment interaction . for this purpose ,",
    "in the next section we consider a more complicated ( for actual evaluation ) diamond norm @xcite , @xmath120 , as an auxiliary quantity used to establish the additivity of the more easily calculable operator norm @xmath58 .",
    "the establishment of the upper - bound estimate for the maximal deviation norm of a multiqubit system , involves several derivations .",
    "we bound this norm by the recently introduced ( in the contexts of quantum computing ) @xcite diamond norm , @xmath120 .",
    "actually , for single qubits , in several models the diamond norm can be expressed via the corresponding maximal deviation norm . at the same time , the diamond norm for the whole quantum system is bounded by sum of the norms of the constituent qubits by using a specific stability property of the diamond norm .",
    "the use of diamond norm was proposed by kitaev @xcite , @xmath121{\\raise2pt\\hbox{$\\scriptscriptstyle{\\otimes}$ } } i\\ } { \\varrho } \\|_{\\rm tr}.\\ ] ] the superoperators @xmath22 , @xmath65 characterize the actual and ideal evolutions according to ( [ t1 ] , [ ti ] ) , @xmath122 is the identity superoperator on a hilbert space @xmath123 whose dimension is the same as that of the corresponding space of the superoperators @xmath22 and @xmath65 , and @xmath124 is an arbitrary density operator in the product space of twice the number of qubits .",
    "the diamond norm has an important stability property , proved in @xcite , @xmath125 which should be compared with ( [ a1a2 ] ) .",
    "note that ( [ stability ] ) is a property of the evolution superoperators rather than that of the density operators : the importance of this difference will become obvious shortly .",
    "consider again a composite system consisting of the two subsystems @xmath95 , @xmath96 , with the noninteracting hamiltonian @xmath126 the evolution superoperator of the system will be @xmath127 and the ideal one @xmath128 the diamond measure for the system can be expressed as @xmath129 by using the stability property ( [ stability ] ) , we get @xmath130    the approximate inequality @xmath131 for the diamond norm @xmath120 has thus the same form as for the norm @xmath58 , ( [ dbound ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize that both relations apply assuming that for short times the subsystem interactions , directly with each other or via their coupling to the bath modes , have had no significant effect .",
    "however , there is an important difference in that the relation for @xmath58 further requires the subsystems to be initially unentangled .",
    "this restriction does not apply for the relation derived for @xmath120 .",
    "this property is particularly useful for quantum computing , the power of which is based on qubit entanglement .",
    "however , even in the simplest case of the diamond norm of one qubit , the calculations are extremely cumbersome .",
    "therefore , the measure @xmath58 is preferrable for actual calculations .",
    "the two deviation - operator norms considered section [ dev ] are related by the following inequality @xmath132 here the left - hand side follows from @xmath133 it follows that the @xmath134th eigenvalue of the deviation operator @xmath53 that has the maximum absolute value , @xmath135 , can be expressed as @xmath136 therefore , we have @xmath137 the right - hand side of ( [ a1 ] ) then also follows , because any density matrix has trace norm 1 , @xmath138    from the relation ( [ a3 ] ) it follows that @xmath139 by taking supremum of the both sides of the relation ( [ a2 ] ) we get @xmath140 where the last step involves technical derivation details not reproduced here .",
    "in fact , in the following sections we show that for a single qubit , calculations within selected models actually give @xmath141 since @xmath4 is generally bounded by ( or equal to ) @xmath142 , it follows that the multiqubit norm @xmath4 is approximately bounded from above by the sum of the single - qubit norms even for the _ initially entangled _ qubits , @xmath143 where @xmath117 labels the qubits .",
    "typically the environment , a large macroscopic system , is modelled by a bath of an infinite number of modes .",
    "each mode is represented by its own hamiltonian @xmath144 , @xmath145 the interaction with the bath is often described by the coupling of its modes to hermitian operator @xmath146 of the quantum system , @xmath147 for a bosonic - mode heat bath @xcite we take @xmath148 here @xmath149 are the bath mode frequencies , @xmath150 are the bosonic annihilation and creation operators , and @xmath151 are the coupling constants .",
