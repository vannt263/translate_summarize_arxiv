    "gravitational lensing , since its beginning , has been used to test general relativity in the weak field approximation .",
    "later on , several studies of null geodesics in strong gravitational fields have been lead in past years .",
    "bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite studied the appearance of a black hole in front of a uniform source ; viergutz @xcite made a semi - analytical investigation of null geodesics in kerr geometry ; nemiroff @xcite studied the visual distortions around a neutron star and around a black hole ; falcke , melia & agol @xcite considered the luminosity of the accretion flow as a source .    a recent paper by virbhadra & ellis @xcite has risen a new interest about gravitational lensing as a probe for strong gravitational fields generated by collapsed objects , providing a new important test for the full general relativity .",
    "they have shown that a source behind a schwarzschild black hole would generate an infinite series of images on both sides of the lens .",
    "these relativistic images are formed by light rays passing close to the event horizon and winding several times around the black hole before emerging towards the observer . by an alternative formulation , frittelli , kling & newman @xcite attained an exact lens equation , giving integral expressions for its solutions , and compared their results to those by virbhadra & ellis .",
    "the phenomenology of collapsed objects with naked singularities , analyzed by virbhadra & ellis in another work @xcite , is radically different .",
    "this difference provides a possible way to test the correctness of the cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "a new , simple and reliable method to investigate the subject was proposed by bozza et al . in ref .",
    "they revisited the schwarzschild black hole lensing defining a _ strong field limit _ for the deflection angle , which retained the first two leading order terms . by this approximation ,",
    "a fully analytical treatment was developed and simple formulae for the position and the magnification of the images were derived .",
    "the same method was applied by eiroa , romero & torres @xcite to a reissner - nordstrom black hole , confirming the appearance of a similar pattern of images .",
    "later on , the formulae given in ref .",
    "@xcite were used by petters @xcite to calculate relativistic effects on microlensing events . finally , in a previous work",
    ", we have developed a generalization of the strong field limit to an arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetime @xcite , comparing the image patterns for several interesting metrics .",
    "we have shown that different collapsed objects are distinguishable by a careful examination of the separation between the first two relativistic images and their luminosity ratio .",
    "the sensitivities required for such measures are out of the actual vlbi projects @xcite , but might be reached in a not so far future .",
    "insofar , only spherically symmetric black holes have been adequately investigated . yet , in general , a black hole would be characterized by a non - zero intrinsic angular momentum which breaks spherical symmetry , leaving only a rotational symmetry around one axis .",
    "rotation heavily affects the gravitational field around the collapsed object .",
    "it is thus natural to expect relevant modifications in the phenomenology of strong field gravitational lensing .",
    "a further motivation for such a study comes from the fact that previous works on the subject have selected the supermassive black hole hosted by the radio source sagittarius a * @xcite as the best candidate for strong field gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "its mass has been estimated to be @xmath0 but our knowledge on a possible intrinsic angular momentum of this object is still very poor",
    ". however , the analysis of the variability of the spectrum in the mm - submm region suggests the possibility of a non - negligible spin @xcite . in particular , the value @xmath1 has been proposed ( with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , we normalize distances to the schwarzschild radius rather than to the black hole mass , hence the factor @xmath2 in this value ) , but high uncertainties in the assumptions behind the calculations may push the spin towards even higher values .    the purpose of this paper is to investigate the relevance of the black hole spin in strong field lensing phenomenology .",
    "we formulate the strong field limit for kerr black hole lensing , considering trajectories close to the equatorial plane . with this limitation",
    "we can not give a complete description of the whole phenomenology , which we shall delay to future works .",
    "however , as we shall see , quasi - equatorial motion yields very sharp indications useful to understand also the general case . in particular , we will show that the presence of a sufficiently high black hole spin drastically changes the expected pattern of observable images .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we recall some general properties of kerr geodesics . in sect .",
    "3 we carry out the strong field limit expansion of the deflection angle on the equatorial plane . in sect .",
    "4 we move off from the equatorial plane and consider trajectories at small declinations . in sect .",
    "5 we write the lens equation on the equatorial plane . in sect .",
    "6 we write a polar lens equation dealing with displacements normal to the equatorial plane . in sect .",
    "7 we find the positions of the caustic points and the magnification of all images in the equatorial plane . in sect .",
    "8 we describe the critical curves and caustic structure .",
    "9 discusses the effects of the black hole spin on the gravitational lensing phenomenology , with special reference to the black hole at the center of our galaxy .",
    "10 contains the summary .",
    "in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xcite @xmath3 , the kerr metric reads    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the specific angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "all distances are measured in schwarzschild radii ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the kerr space is characterized by a spherical event horizon at @xmath7 for @xmath8 . beyond this critical value of the spin",
    "there is no event horizon and causality violations are present in the whole spacetime , with the appearance of a naked singularity @xcite .",
    "we shall restrict to subcritical angular momenta .",
    "the ellipsoid @xmath9 is the static limit bounding the region where every static worldine ( @xmath10 ) becomes spacelike .",
    "the region between the static limit and the horizon is called ergosphere : here everything is bound to rotate around the black hole .    the geodesics equations can be derived taking @xmath11 as the lagrangian , where the dot indicates the derivative with respect to some affine parameter .    finding four integrals of motion , we can transform these equations into a set of four first order equations which are equivalent to the original ones .",
    "two costants of motions are the energy and the angular momentum of the particle , given by @xmath12 by a suitable choice of the affine parameter , we can set @xmath13    from these equations , we find an expression for @xmath14 and @xmath15 in terms of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19    @xmath20 is another constant of motion , which vanishes for null geodesics and can be used to write @xmath21 @xmath22    finally , @xmath23 can be obtained in terms of a fourth integral of motion , separating the hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite : @xmath24    eqs .",
    "( [ dtds])-([dottheta ] ) represent the sought set of first order differential equations , suitable for a detailed study .",
    "the integrals of motion @xmath18 and @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of the geometric parameters of the incoming light ray trajectory . in general",
    ", we can identify a light ray coming from infinity by three parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig inicon ] ) , referring to the straight line which the photon would follow if there were no gravitational field .",
    "the projection of this line on the equatorial plane has a distance @xmath26 from the origin , which we shall call the projected impact parameter . at this minimum projected distance",
    ", the light ray has some height @xmath27 on the equatorial plane . finally , the inclination @xmath28 is the angle that the light ray forms with the equatorial plane .",
    "when we switch on the gravitational field , the light ray is obviously deviated from this ideal straight line , but these three parameters can still be used to label any light rays coming from infinity .    taking the asymptotic limit of the equations of motion , we can write @xmath18 and @xmath25 in terms of the initial conditions characterizing the light ray @xmath29",
    "in this section , we consider light rays strictly lying on the equatorial plane @xmath30 by setting @xmath31 .",
    "the reduced metric has the form @xmath32 with @xmath33    what we say in this section is immediately extendable to any axially symmetric spacetime if we replace eq .",
    "( [ abcd ] ) by any other expression .    as @xmath34 , by eq .",
    "( [ j = u cos psi0 ] ) the angular momentum @xmath18 coincides with the impact parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the impact parameter is also related to the minimum distance @xmath35 reached by the photon . in general , a light ray coming from infinity approaches the black hole , reaches this minimum distance @xmath35 and then leaves again towards infinity .",
    "evaluating the lagrangian at @xmath36 , we find an implicit relation between @xmath37 and the closest approach distance @xmath35 @xmath38 where all the metric functions with the subscript 0 are evaluated at @xmath36 .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath26 is then univocally determined by @xmath35 and vice versa . choosing the positive sign before the square root ,",
    "we describe only light rays winding counterclockwise when seen from above . for @xmath39 the black hole",
    "also rotates counterclockwise , while for @xmath40 the black hole and the photon rotate in opposite senses .    dividing @xmath41 by @xmath21 , we find the azimuthal shift as a function of the distance @xmath42    integrating this expression from @xmath35 to infinity we find half the deflection angle as a function of the closest approach .",
    "given the symmetry between approach and departure , we can write the whole deflection angle as @xmath43    @xmath44 is the total azimuthal shift .",
    "it evaluates to @xmath45 for a straight line and becomes larger as the light ray is bent by the gravitational field .",
    "the expression for a spherically symmetric metric , given in ref .",
    "@xcite can be recovered setting @xmath46 .",
    "the deflection angle grows as @xmath35 decreases .",
    "it diverges when @xmath35 reaches a minimum value @xmath47 which represents the radius of the photon sphere .",
    "if a photon falls inside this sphere , it is destined to be absorbed by the black hole . of course",
    ", we will have different photon spheres for photons winding in the same sense of the rotation of the black hole ( hereafter direct photons ) and for photons winding in the opposite sense ( retrograde photons ) .",
    "in general , we expect the latter to be absorbed more easily . their photon sphere will thus be larger than that of retrograde photons , which can escape more easily . as we shall see later ,",
    "this is what happens .",
    "following the philosophy of the strong field limit , we look for an expansion of the deflection angle of the form @xmath48 where the coefficients @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 depend on the metric functions evaluated at @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath52 is the distance between the lens and the observer , so that the angular separation of the image from the lens ( also referred as impact angle ) is @xmath53 .",
    "all the steps to be taken towards this final expression are very similar to those for spherically symmetric black holes , with few adjustments .",
    "we shall sketch them very briefly , referring to ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "we define the variables @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",

    "the function @xmath58 is regular for all values of @xmath59 and @xmath35 , while @xmath60 diverges for @xmath61 . to find out the order of divergence of the integrand , we expand the argument of the square root in @xmath60 to the second order in @xmath59 @xmath62    when @xmath63 is non zero , the leading order of the divergence in @xmath64 is @xmath65 , which can be integrated to give a finite result . when @xmath63 vanishes , the divergence is @xmath66 which makes the integral diverge .",

    "the study of the deflection angle for photons lying on the equatorial plane is sufficient to write a one - dimensional lens equation . however , to address the caustic structure and calculate the magnification of the images , we need a two - dimensional lens equation .",

    "[ fig cau ] we plot the positions of the first five relativistic caustic points as functions of the black hole angular momentum .",

    "@xmath203 is thus close to @xmath204 but is anticipated for negative @xmath5 and delayed for positive @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath205 is behind the lens but , at large angular momenta , can move very far from the initial position . at high values of the spin ,",
    "the caustic points drift so much that they can even change their riemann fold .",

    "[ fig mu3 ] we plot the magnifying power @xmath209 of the caustic point @xmath205 , which for @xmath87 generates the first relativistic image of a source behind the lens .",

    "the divergence in the magnification when @xmath5 approaches its extremal value @xmath2 should not be taken seriously , as the standard strong field limit approximation breaks down as explained in sect .",
    "[ sec equ ] .",
    "the shape of @xmath207 remains more or less the same for every @xmath194 but , since @xmath210 , we have that @xmath211 the magnification of enhanced images falls quite rapidly as we let the photons make more and more loops .",
    "it is well known that the jacobian of the schwarzschild lens has an infinite series of einstein rings @xcite .",
    "the first one is the classical weak field einstein ring whose angular radius is @xmath212 the corresponding caustic is the point at @xmath213 .    at small impact parameters we enter the strong field limit of the schwarzschild lensing and the light rays",

    "the caustic is at @xmath214 .",
    "decreasing @xmath26 further , the light ray completes a loop and we have the third einstein ring , whose caustic point is @xmath215 and is superposed on the first caustic point ( on the second riemann fold ) .    summing up , the schwarzschild lens has a large weak field einstein ring and an infinite series of concentric relativistic einstein rings , very close to the minimum impact angle @xmath216 . in the region bounded by the @xmath199-th ring and the @xmath217-th one",
    ", the sign of the jacobian is @xmath218 .",
    "what changes when we turn on the spin of the black hole ?",
    "as regards the first einstein ring of the weak field limit , it is distorted and shifted . as a consequence , the caustic point turns into a finite extension diamond shaped caustic @xcite .    for the critical curves in the strong field limit",
    ", we can calculate their intersections with the equatorial plane , which are @xmath219 they are closer to the optical axis on the positive @xmath5 side ( for left - winding photons ) and farther on the negative @xmath5 side ( i.e. for right - winding photons ) .",
    "therefore critical curves are distorted and shifted towards the negative @xmath5 side , that is the western side , if north is the direction of the spin .",
    "the caustics are no longer points but acquire a non vanishing extension . @xmath220 and @xmath221 represent the intersections of the @xmath194-th caustic with the equatorial plane . as @xmath222 and @xmath223 the caustic",
    "is shifted towards the western side .",
    "to visualize this situation , in fig .",
    "[ fig cau2 ] , we have plotted the projections of the caustics on the equatorial plane , as seen from the north direction .",
    "the @xmath224 $ ] caustic is the weak field one , which stays almost aligned on the optical axis , while the relativistic caustics drift in the clockwise direction .",
    "as @xmath194 grows , the caustics become larger and farther from their initial position on the optical axis . examining fig .",
    "[ fig cau ] we notice that at high angular momenta the caustics may become very large , covering even several riemann folds !    at the lowest order in @xmath83 and neglecting any backreaction on the equatorial lens equation it is not possible to give a rigorous classification of the type of catastrophes we encounter on the equatorial plane",
    ". however , the fact that the first caustic in the weak field assumes the typical diamond shape of quadrupole lenses suggests a similar picture for strong field caustics .",
    "if this is the case , then the caustic points @xmath192 on the equatorial plane are cusps .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that if we let @xmath116 decrease below some @xmath192 the corresponding image changes parity .",
    "this can happen only when at the critical point two images are formed with the same parity of the original image @xcite .",
    "these images rapidly move in the vertical direction and are missed in our quasi - equatorial approximation .",
    "after all the analysis of the quasi - equatorial lensing in the kerr spacetime , we are able to discuss the phenomenological relevance of the black hole spin .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that all spherically symmetric black holes produce the same patterns of relativistic images .",
    "these patterns differ by the separations and the luminosity ratios between different relativistic images .",
    "the conclusion was that if strong field gravitational lensing will be caught by future vlbi experiments , it may provide a means to distinguish between different classes of black holes .    in spherically symmetric black hole lensing , a generic source",
    "not aligned with the optical axis produces extremely faint relativistic images . on the contrary , a point source perfectly aligned along the optical axis produces ( theoretically ) infinitely bright images",
    "actually the finite source radius cuts off the real brightness of the images .",
    "the relativistic images are maximally amplified altogether since all the caustic points of spherically symmetric black holes lie on the optical axis .    in kerr lensing ,",
    "the situation becomes radically different .",
    "the crucial fact is that the caustics no longer lie on the optical axis but drift throughout the trigonometric interval .",
    "then if the source is close to one caustic point , it can not be close to any other .",
    "the consequence is that only one image at a time can be enhanced , while all the others stay extremely faint .",
    "to clarify the situation , suppose we have a source aligned with the caustic point @xmath225 .",
    "then the outermost relativistic image on the eastern side will be enhanced .",
    "if we put the source on @xmath226 , then we only enhance the first relativistic image on the western side .",
    "if we put the source on @xmath227 , then the second relativistic image on the eastern side will be enhanced and so on .    rather than seeing an infinite series of relativistic images on each side of the lens",
    ", we would observe only one enhanced relativistic image .",
    "it would be difficult to recognize a single image as a gravitational lensing phenomenon rather than any kind of environmental source around the black hole .",
    "even if we managed , it would be quite tricky to extract information about the strong fields around the black hole from one single relativistic image .",
    "however , if the source is inside the caustic , two additional images should appear , making easier to recognize their real nature of lensed images of the same source .",
    "moreover , three images can be used to investigate the gravitational field around the black hole and put constraints on its parameters .",
    "alas , the additional images are missed in our quasi - equatorial approximation . in order to catch them ,",
    "it is necessary to face the problem of kerr lensing in its general form . a reliable treatment of non equatorial images ,",
    "would complete our quasi - equatorial study and would make possible a detailed investigation of strong field gravitational lensing for high values of the black hole spin .    by now , we have discussed the two extreme situations : spherically symmetric black holes ( @xmath87 ) and high spin black holes .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the value of the spin which separates the two regimes .",
    "we shall do it , referring to the black hole at the center of our galaxy , assuming @xmath228 kpc , @xmath229 kpc .    in order to consider a black hole as spherically symmetric",
    ", the caustic drift must be negligible when compared to the extension of the source .",
    "in fact , in this case , the source does not `` see '' different caustics but they behave roughly as they were all at the same point . for small @xmath5 the @xmath192 scale",
    "linearly as @xmath230 , with @xmath231 and @xmath232 numerical factors of order one . then",
    ", the drift between two consecutive caustics will be negligible if @xmath233    if we consider a source with radius @xmath234 , we then find that @xmath5 should be lower than @xmath235 .",
    "when @xmath5 is greater than this value , the source will see only one caustic at a time .",
    "however , the caustic will be still seen as point - like , since the extension of the caustic scales as @xmath236 . therefore , we will still have two enhanced images , corresponding to the two intersections of the @xmath194-th caustic with the equatorial plane @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "this intermediate situation takes place as long as @xmath239 with @xmath240 and @xmath241 of order one .    for a @xmath242 source",
    ", this requires @xmath243 . beyond this value , only one image at a time will be enhanced ( together with an eventual additional pair of images if the source is inside the caustic ) , while all the others stay invisible .",
    "these estimates reveal that the phenomenology of spherically symmetric black holes is realistic only for black holes with tiny spin . yet , as recalled in the introduction , the first estimates of the spin of the black hole at the center of our galaxy push towards high values @xcite .",
    "if these estimates are confirmed , then we are forced to include spin in any realistic treatment of strong field gravitational lensing for sgr a*.",
    "in this paper we have explored the modifications to strong field limit gravitational lensing induced by the rotation of the central body , analyzing the quasi - equatorial null geodesics .",
    "the most apparent change is the formation of extended caustics which , for high angular momenta , can cover several riemann folds .",
    "this situation is radically different from spherically symmetric black holes where the caustics are points aligned behind and in front of the lens . while for @xmath87 a source behind the lens",
    "is simultaneously close to all odd caustics and gives rise only to enhanced images , for kerr black holes the source can be close to one caustic at a time and thus produces only one enhanced image .    as secondary interesting effects , we can also mention the asymmetry between images formed by photons winding in the same sense of the black hole and photons winding in the opposite sense , the latter appearing farther from the black hole .",
    "the magnification decreases with the spin , being higher for retrograde images .",
    "the study of quasi - equatorial kerr gravitational lensing is very instructive and has allowed us to discover a great number of interesting features of spinning black holes .",
    "however , to address the phenomenology of the black hole at the center of our galaxy and/or other black holes with deeper insight , further investigation is necessary .",
    "in fact , we need a punctual description of the caustic structure not limited to the equatorial plane .",
    "the existence of extended caustics suggests the formation of pairs of non - equatorial images , missed in our approximation , which are of striking importance for the phenomenology .",
    "the quasi - equatorial lensing , studied in this work , then represents a first fundamental step to understand lensing by spinning black holes .",
    "however , the complexity of the problem requires a global approach in order to give correct and complete answers to all observational questions .",
    "this settles as the main objective for future work on strong field gravitational lensing ."
