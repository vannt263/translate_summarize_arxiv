    "an operation of the @xmath1 linear collider at a center - of - mass energy of 5  tev beyond the large hadron collider and the 500  gev @xmath1 linear collider , requires a luminosity of @xmath2 for a study of particle physics . to achieve the required luminosity in several tev colliders , the phase space of the electron and positron beams",
    "must be significantly reduced before the beam is accelerated in a main linear accelerator .",
    "the technique which could accomplish the required cooling for the linear colliders was proposed by r.  palmer and v.telnov  @xcite and is laser - compton cooling . in laser - compton cooling ,",
    "the beam loses both transverse and longitudinal momentum by compton scattered photons , during head - on collisions with laser photons .",
    "the longitudinal momentum is restored to the beam in a linear accelerator .",
    "since the compton scattered photons follow the initial electron trajectory with a small additional spread due to much lower energy of photons ( a few ev ) than the energy of electrons ( several gev ) , the transverse distribution of electron beams remains almost unchanged and also the angular spread is almost constant .",
    "consequently the emittance @xmath3 remains almost unchanged ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 the transverse beam size and the angular divergence . at the same time , the electron energy decreases from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "thus the normalized emittances have decreased as follows @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the initial and final normalized emittances , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is electron mass , and the factor of the emittance reduction @xmath13 .",
    "the method of electron beam cooling , repeated many times , allows further reduction of the transverse emittances after damping rings or guns by 1 - 3 orders of magnitude  @xcite .    in this paper , we have evaluated the effects of the laser - compton interaction for transverse cooling using the monte carlo code  @xcite . the simulation calculates the effects of the nonlinear compton scattering between the laser photons and the electrons during a multi - cooling stage .",
    "next , we examine the optics for cooling with and without chromatic correction . the laser - compton cooling for jlc",
