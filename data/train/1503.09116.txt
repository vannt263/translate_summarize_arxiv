    "the entanglement properties of free - fermion systems have been the topic of many studies and various different cases have been investigated , see e.g. @xcite . in one dimension , these comprise homogeneous critical chains where the ground - state entanglement entropy @xmath0 varies logarithmically with the size @xmath1 of the subsystem , and non - critical ones where it approaches a constant for large @xmath1 .",
    "single defects , both at interfaces @xcite and in the interior @xcite were studied , as well as inhomogeneous systems with random @xcite , aperiodic @xcite and exponentially decaying @xcite couplings or random site energies @xcite .",
    "finally , systems in external potentials which produce a varying density and surface regions have been investigated @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we look at yet another situation , namely at systems formed from two pieces with different properties . specifically , we study chains composed either of two critical parts , or a critical and a non - critial one .",
    "such systems have been considered previously in the context of conformal invariance @xcite . in our case , they are realized in the form of undimerized or dimerized tight - binding models coupled by a special bond .",
    "physically , this corresponds to either two metals with different bandwidths , or a metal and an insulator , and we will use this terminology in the following . in both cases",
    "one has two types of single - particle eigenfunctions : those essentially confined to one of the subsystems , and other ones extending through the whole system but having different wavelengths in the two parts .",
    "this is the same situation as for a potential step in quantum mechanics .",
    "the occupied single - particle eigenfunctions determine the entanglement , and we study it between the two different pieces of the composite system in its ground state .    for the metal - metal system at",
    "half filling , the asymptotic result is very simple .",
    "it turns out that only the interface bond matters and one comes back to the defect problem solved previously in @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath0 varies logarithmically and the coefficient @xmath2 is determined by the transmission through the interface .",
    "the subleading terms , on the other hand , depend on the asymmetry but one can take this into account by a rescaling of the length and find links to conformal formulae based on the nature of the extended states .",
    "away from half filling , the entanglement is small as long as only the localized states are occupied .",
    "it increases , when the extended states come into play , but there are strong variations with the filling which depend on the size and are also connected with the ratio of the bandwidths , which brings an additional length scale into the problem .    for the metal - insulator system at",
    "half filling , the entanglement lies systematically between that of the two pure systems . at large sizes , the insulator with its band gap dominates and limits the increase of @xmath0 . for sizes smaller than the correlation length , however , there are no states in the gap and one observes a logarithmic increase of the entropy .",
    "the system is also a good case to compare the entanglement hamiltonians on both sides .",
    "they have the same spectra , but their single - particle eigenfunctions and their explicit forms as hopping models are quite different .",
    "basically , one finds that the features are similar to those of the pure systems on the corresponding side of the chain . for the eigenfunctions",
    "this means a decay from the interface into the interior which is slow in the metal and exponential in the insulator @xcite .    for the metal - metal system we also study the behaviour of the entanglement entropy after a local quench in which the two pieces in their ground states are put together .",
    "here the two fermi velocities can be seen directly in the time structure and the result can be interpreted in the well - known picture of two emitted particles @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the set - up und give the basic formulae . in section 3",
    "we investigate the metal - metal case by forming and diagonalizing numerically the correlation matrix .",
    "we show the entanglement entropy and discuss its scaling behaviour and filling dependence together with some entanglement spectra . in section 4",
    "we consider the metal - insulator case at half filling and compare all relevant quantities with those of the pure systems . in section 5 we present the time evolution of @xmath0 after connecting two metallic systems and section 6 contains a summary .",
    "finally , some analytical results for the metal - metal system are given in an appendix .",
    "we consider open chains of free fermions with nearest - neighbour hopping and @xmath3 sites .",
    "the hopping is different in the left and right half and also between both parts .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath4 for the metal - metal system @xmath5 and one has three parameters in the problem .",
    "however , by a rescaling of @xmath6 , one can always achieve @xmath7 .",
    "we will assume this in the following and write the quantities as @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , we will always consider positive @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 . in some places",
    "we also use the ratio @xmath13 .    for vanishing coupling ( @xmath14 ) , the two parts of the chain have single - particle energies @xmath15 with momenta @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding band structure with bands between @xmath17 is shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] . in the coupled system",
    ", one has extended states for @xmath18 , while outside this region they are confined essentially to the left half - chain .",
    "moreover , one can have two states localized at the interface if @xmath19 is large enough .    for the metal - insulator system we take @xmath20 in the insulator ,",
    "one thus has alternating hopping , two sites per unit cell and the single - particle energies @xmath21 where the momenta have to be determined from the boundary condition .",
    "thus there is a gap between @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting band structure is shown on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] . for an open chain ,",
    "there are also states localized at the boundary with exponentially small @xmath23 , if the outermost bond is a weak one .",
    "the coupled system has extended states for @xmath24 and others , confined essentially to the metal , inside the gap . in this sense , it is still critical .",
    "it is simple to set up the eigenvalue problem for the full systems , and some details are given in the appendix .",
    "however , the matching conditions in the center are difficult to handle in general . therefore we determine the single - particle eigenvalues @xmath25 and the corresponding ( real ) eigenfunctions @xmath26 numerically .",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath27 is then @xmath28 where the sum extends over the states @xmath29 in the fermi sea .",
    "restricting @xmath30 to the chosen subsystem ( either the left or the right half - chain ) , its eigenvalues @xmath31 give the single - particle eigenvalues @xmath32 $ ] of the free - fermion entanglement hamiltonian @xmath33 in @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reduced density matrix @xcite . from them ,",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath0 follows as @xmath36 in addition to the eigenvalues @xmath31 resp .",
    "@xmath37 , we also determine the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath38 and construct @xmath33 in section 4 .",
    "we first consider half - filled systems where the fermi level is in the middle of the bands .",

    "[ ent_mm_delta ] , both for even and for odd @xmath1 .",
    "one sees that the typical increase with the size , known for the homogeneous case @xmath40 , persists in the composite systems .",
    "the plot against lnl shows that also the asymptotic law @xmath41 is unchanged .",
    "however , the value of @xmath42 becomes smaller and the finite - size effects , in particular the even - odd alternation , increase dramatically as @xmath11 becomes larger . for @xmath43 (",
    "not shown ) , the values of @xmath0 are initially close to zero and to @xmath44 , respectively . in this case , the ratio of the bandwidths @xmath45 is already very small , the states localized on the left drop rapidly on the right , while the extended states have very small amplitudes on the left ( see the appendix ) . for even @xmath1 , this leads to a small entanglement which only increases as more states come into play at larger @xmath1 .",
    "the value @xmath44 for odd @xmath1 is a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry of the problem which , in this case , forces one of the @xmath37 to vanish .     for @xmath46 and three values of @xmath11 .",

    "written differently , one has @xmath52 in the asymptotic region , where one has straight lines in a logarithmic plot , this feature is not surprising : a rescaling can always generate the necessary shift to make the curves coincide .",

    "however , a closer look at the final decrease shows that it comes too early since , as mentioned , the value of @xmath147 is too small .",
    "finally , we note that the first - burst results for a homogeneous but unequally divided system with the same round - trip times @xmath160 and @xmath161 lie above ours , and the difference increases with @xmath11 . thus the two problems are not trivially connected .",
    "we have considered the entanglement in fermionic chains composed of two different halves . in solid - state terminology , they were metals and insulators , while in statistical - physics terms they corresponded to critical and non - critical systems .",
    "the metal - metal system at half filling showed the same logarithmic behaviour of @xmath0 as a homogeneous chain with a defect . in the subleading terms , the asymmetry showed up , but the entropy had a remarkable scaling property .",
    "its filling dependence , finally , showed oscillatory behaviour again linked to the asymmetry .",
    "both features could be understood from the nature of the extended eigenfunctions which are the same as in homogeneous systems with different lengths .",
    "the difference in the fermi velocities showed up directly in the quench experiment where two half - filled metals were joined and the entanglement was monitored . in that case , the value of @xmath60 determined , how many cycles one sees in @xmath142 , before a certain return to the initial situation takes place .",
    "this pattern would occur in unsymmetrically divided homogeneous systems only with additional defects .",
    "the metal - insulator system was somewhat simpler .",
    "its entanglement properties were seen to lie always between the two pure systems and as a function of the size , one has a crossover from an initial critical behaviour with a logarithmic increase of the entanglement to a saturation typical for a non - critical system with finite correlation length .",
    "it also provided an instructive example for entanglement hamiltonians which are quite different for the two subsystems although they have the same spectra , as they must .",
    "one should note that the dimerized hopping model used for the insulator , and investigated already in @xcite , plays a central role in the theory of polyacetylene @xcite . in that sense",
    ", we studied a particular polymer system .",
    "we considered the geometry with open ends , because then one has only a single interface .",
    "however , one could equally well look at rings . for composite transverse ising models this",
    "was done first in @xcite but without particular interface bonds and with a view on the spectra .",
    "obtaining the entanglement entropy is more complicated , and we could only give an analytical result for the asymptotic behaviour of the metal - metal system .    while we focussed on the entanglement entropy , it is known that the particle - number fluctuations in the subsystems behave similarly @xcite .",
    "thus , in a homogeneous metal , the prefactor of the @xmath47 term in the fluctuations is given by @xmath162 with the transmission coefficient @xmath72 @xcite and varies qualitatively like @xmath2 . the same result is found in the composite systems , and this could offer a way to access the entanglement experimentally .",

    "let @xmath163 and @xmath164 denote the wave function at site @xmath165 on the left and right , respectively .",
    "the bulk solutions on the two sides are waves with momenta @xmath166 and @xmath167 and energy @xmath168 . at the interface ,",
    "the equations are @xmath169 for a wave coming in from the left and being partially reflected and transmitted , the amplitudes are @xmath170 inserting this into the relations ( [ interface ] ) , one finds for the reflection coefficient @xmath171 where the quantity @xmath85 is defined as @xmath172 . in our parametrization , where @xmath7 , one has @xmath173 .",
    "the transmission coefficient follows from @xmath174 and can be written @xmath175 if the left and right subsystems are identical , @xmath176 , and one finds the result for a bond defect in an otherwise homogeneous chain .",
    "the same holds in a general system if one is in the middle of the bands .",
    "then @xmath177 and one has the result @xmath178 due to the factor @xmath179 in ( [ transmission ] ) , the transmission vanishes at the edges of the narrow band .",
    "the extended eigenfunctions of @xmath6 have the form @xmath180 and the conditions ( [ interface ] ) lead to @xmath181 which , together with @xmath182 , determines the allowed momenta . setting @xmath183 and assuming @xmath1",
    "even , it takes the form @xmath184 the relation between the @xmath185 reads @xmath186 and for small @xmath60 simplifies to @xmath187 .",
    "inserting this into ( [ momenta2 ] ) and setting @xmath188 in the numerator then gives @xmath189 which contains only the momentum @xmath94 .",
    "the solutions can be discussed graphically , but one sees directly that besides @xmath1 a second length @xmath89 appears . if it is large enough , the tangent completes several cycles as @xmath94 varies , and this can lead to additional features in the momenta or in the amplitude ratio which is , again with @xmath188 , @xmath190 if @xmath94 is small , @xmath191 for all @xmath192 and ( [ momenta3 ] ) for @xmath193 can be written in the two forms @xmath194 both equations are the same as for a _ homogeneous _ chain built up from two pieces with different lengths and can therefore be solved explicitly . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the homogeneous system has length @xmath195 , while for @xmath196 it has length @xmath197 , where @xmath198 .",
    "thus the small momenta are equidistant , i.e. @xmath199 using ( [ momenta4 ] ) in ( [ amplitudes ] ) , one finds @xmath200 , i.e. the amplitudes are larger on the right than on the left .",
    "including normalization to leading order , this gives prefactors @xmath201 and @xmath202 which correspond exactly to these chain lengths .",
