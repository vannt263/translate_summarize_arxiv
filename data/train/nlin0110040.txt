    "the point l@xmath116 marks the transition from phase to defect chaos studied earlier @xcite .    as long as the dynamics is regular ( @xmath87 ) , the upper bound for the limit ( onset of splitting at sn , dotted curve ) of wound - up phase chaos reproduces well the numerical observations . for chaotic states with @xmath88 defect formation eventually becomes possible even despite the presence of the splitting instability .",
    "this coincides with the increasing weight of the instability of single maws to attractive interaction of subsequent amplitude peaks .",

    "a single pulse - shaped modulation with the period equal to the cell length was present in the system and led to a defect .",

    "small amplitude maws ( `` lower branch''-maws ) of specific spatial period @xmath1 exist between a supercritical hopf bifurcation ( hb ) and a saddle - node ( sn ) bifurcation .",

    "maws are a direct consequence of the eckhaus instability of plane waves ; they are obtained by a computer - assisted nonlinear analysis of this instability .",
    "we encounter sns with decreasing values of @xmath1 as @xmath35 and @xmath0 are increased .",

    "these domains are limited by the interaction instability at low and the splitting instability at high values of the spatial period @xmath1 of the maw .",

    "this sn establishes a `` lower '' bound for defect formation and thereby for the limit @xmath34 of wound - up phase chaos .",
    "the splitting instability can inhibit defect formation if the sn occurs at large @xmath1 hence defects are created more frequently for parameters above a second curve where the splitting instability vanishes at the sn . thereby an `` upper '' bound for the limit @xmath34 of wound - up phase chaos is obtained .",
    "earlier numerical observations on @xmath115 are well reproduced for @xmath94 , respectively small @xmath5 . for @xmath117 ,",
