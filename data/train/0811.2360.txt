    "the concept of a measurement lies at the heart of quantum mechanics . for a long time",
    "this has been a topic of fundamental discussion @xcite .",
    "quantum information science @xcite has transformed it to a basic technical issue , at the core of many applications @xcite . of particular importance",
    "are quantum state measurements , since they can reveal complete information about a quantum system , or more precisely about its preparation process @xcite . in this sense",
    "such measurement schemes attach a certain operational meaning to a quantum state .",
    "full tomography @xcite of an unknown state requires infinitely many identical copies of a quantum system .",
    "the no - cloning theorem @xcite , however , prevents to produce them from a single system .",
    "hence we always encounter the typical situation of an estimation approach @xcite : it is only possible to collect a _ limited _ amount of information from a _",
    "finite _ sample of identical systems . using the corresponding finite set of measurement data",
    ", we then have to deliver an estimate for the underlying quantum state .",
    "the benchmark for the quality of such a procedure is the optimal average fidelity of a joint measurement @xcite on all systems of the finite sample . on the other hand ,",
    "the needed physical principles for such collective measurements are not simple to realize .",
    "hence this optimal approach has been approximated by various local measurement schemes @xcite combined with suitable classical communication .",
    "the physics of the related measurements on single systems has a rather simple operational meaning , while the obtained estimation fidelities can be close to the optimal ones .",
    "the present contribution aims at the estimation of a pure qubit of which only a limited number @xmath0 of identically prepared copies is available .",
    "our aim is not to optimize a certain fidelity .",
    "we rather examine how a basic measurement concept can be used for estimation of quantum states .",
    "we investigate measurements that compare the unknown copies , one by one , to a known reference state , a `` quantum ruler '' . for these comparisons",
    "we restrict ourselves to measurements that yield symmetry information only .",
    "such measurements have been used in @xcite for state comparison , and based on this work applied to programmable unambiguous state discrimination @xcite .",
    "moreover these symmetry measurements are a simple realization of a quantum `` multimeter '' @xcite , where the ruler state is `` quantum software '' that defines what measurement is performed .",
    "to be more specific , our comparison is done by symmetry measurements .",
    "in contrast to a spin measurement such a comparison is close to classical concepts of measurement : we determine the agreement between the unknown system and a known ruler .",
    "therefore , it will be interesting to see how successful this ansatz can be in the quantum domain .    in order to define this in more detail , we write the unknown qubit state@xmath1 in a computational basis @xmath2 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath0 identically prepared copies of this qubit are available , i.e. they all stem from the same but unknown preparation process . each copy",
    "is compared to a reference state@xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "hence for each measurement step @xmath5 the corresponding two - particle system is in the product state @xmath6 .",
    "our measurement concept now consists in determining the symmetry of this state with respect to particle exchange .",
    "the results will be dichotomic : either we obtain a `` symmetric ( @xmath7 ) '' or an `` antisymmetric ( @xmath8 ) '' signature .    the probability of finding the product state in the antisymmetric subspace , spanned by the antisymmetric state @xmath9 , reads@xmath10 we denote the complementary probability , i.e. the probability of finding the product state in the symmetric subspace , by @xmath11 .    before discussing how to utilize this kind of measurement for quantum state estimation , we mention a simple realization by linear optics @xcite .",
    "let us assume , that the unknown and the reference qubit are prepared as superpositions of single photon polarizations .",
    "these photons impinge on a 50:50 beam splitter that is perfectly balanced concerning the two polarizations in each of its input ports .",
    "that is , the unknown photon enters one input port , the reference photon the other one .",
    "the probability of finding a single photon with arbitrary polarization in each output port is then equivalent to @xmath12 , eq.([eq : pa ] ) .",
    "we therefore can measure it with efficient detectors that simply distinguish the vacuum from any finite number of photons .",
    "this measurement scheme has already been experimentally utilized for measuring the overlap of quantum states @xcite .",
    "we perform symmetry measurements on @xmath0 copies of the qubit @xmath13 and the corresponding reference states . for each single reference @xmath14",
    "we obtain a measurement result @xmath15 , which is either @xmath8 , for the antisymmetric subspace , or @xmath7 , for the symmetric subspace , respectively . according to bayes rule",
    "@xcite we can calculate the probability of this sequence @xmath16\\}$ ] of results and references , and use it as a likelihood function @xcite @xmath17 for the unknown qubit @xmath13 .",
    "note that @xmath18 is given as a function of the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , according to eq.([eq : psi ] ) .",
    "their values at the maximum of @xmath18 determine the estimated state @xmath21 for one specific measurement sequence @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "so far we still have no rule how to choose the reference states .",
    "the first reference @xmath23 is always arbitrary , since we have no information about the state @xmath24 before the first measurement .",
    "we therefore always choose @xmath25 .",
    "but at a later measurement stage we already have the results of the preceding measurements .",
    "then an adaptive strategy for choosing the new references using the already obtained data is possible and will be described in the next section . after fixing the next reference according to a chosen adaption strategy , we perform the next symmetry measurement .",
    "then we repeat this cycle until all copies of the unknown state are used up .    to quantify",
    "how well the unknown state @xmath24 and its final estimate @xmath26 coincide , we apply the corresponding fidelity @xmath27 .",
    "this value of course depends on @xmath24 as well as on the probabilistic outcomes @xmath28 in the measurement sequence @xmath22 .",
    "to arrive at a measure for the quality of the used adaptive measurement strategy we have to average over all unknown states @xmath24 on the bloch sphere , and all measurement outcomes .",
    "this leads to the mean expected estimation fidelity @xmath29 where the integration @xmath30 denotes a bloch sphere average and @xmath31 is the average over all measurement sequences possible within the chosen adaption strategy .",
    "the simplest way to construct an estimation scheme , which achieves equal average fidelities for all possible unknown states , is to use equally distributed random reference states .",
    "of course this is not an adaption , but a lower bound to which adaptive schemes can be compared in order to assess their quality . to calculate the corresponding fidelity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fquerex ] ) , we use monte carlo techniques .",
    "that means the result of a measurement is simulated by a random number generator , in such a way that the results follow the distribution eq.([eq : pa ] ) . from these randomized results",
    "we calculate @xmath32 , and by averaging over @xmath33 runs we arrive at a reliable value for @xmath34 , eq.([eq : fquerex ] ) .",
    "the results obtained with random references are depicted in fig.[fig : fidelity - maximization ] .",
    "as one can see , the average fidelity @xmath34 grows with the length @xmath0 of the measurement sequence .",
    "hence in principle an estimation based on a symmetry comparison with reference states works .",
    "however , the average fidelities are quite low .",
    "therefore , we ask whether this quantum estimation method allows for adaption , which means choosing appropriate references @xmath35 from one measurement step to the next .",
    "our goal is to maximize the fidelity of the finally estimated state .",
    "we can directly use this as a quality measure for finding adapted reference states . an optimal way to do this would be to calculate the fidelity of the last estimated state and maximize it with respect to the reference state we want to adapt . in order to keep the computational effort reasonable ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the maximization of the fidelity @xmath36 after the next measurement .    to explain this in detail , let us assume that we have already performed @xmath5 measurements .",
    "then we can calculate an _ expected _ fidelity for the next measurement step @xmath37 _ before _ we perform it . here",
    "`` expected '' means to average over the possible measurement outcomes .",
    "such a quantity is a function of the next reference state @xmath38 . to get the best possible fidelity after the next measurement we have to choose a reference that maximizes it .    to quantify this expected fidelity",
    ", we have to determine the states @xmath39 and @xmath40 that we would estimate if we got the outcomes @xmath8 or @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "note that these states themselves depend on @xmath38 .",
    "then we average over the corresponding fidelities @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , since we do not know @xmath13 , we have to average over it too , and hence arrive at the condition @xmath43 for the next reference state @xmath38 .",
    "note that we have neglected the information on the distribution of @xmath24 , we had already obtained in the preceding steps , namely the likelihood @xmath44 , eq.([eq : like ] ) .",
    "in other words , the @xmath5 measurement outcomes and their corresponding reference states , i.e. the sequence @xmath45 , enter implicitly via the adaption of the reference states but not explicitly in a weight factor for @xmath46 .",
    "we gain the advantage that all expressions to be integrated are known functions of the involved quantum states .",
    "hence we can easily perform the integration and arrive at an analytical expression depending on @xmath38 . nevertheless , here might be room for further improvements of a quantum adaption . to assess this adaption strategy , we again simulate the corresponding estimation scheme , and compare it to the random reference strategy .",
    "as one can see from fig.[fig : fidelity - maximization ] , application of the adaptive scheme gives significantly better fidelities than a random selection of reference states .",
    "to further elucidate the convergence of the adaptive scheme , the evolution of estimated states on the bloch sphere is depicted in fig.[fig : estbk ] . as expected for an adaption ,",
    "the estimated states accumulate near the unknown state .",
    "the simulation shows , that in doing so , they follow , within the numerical errors , an exponential distribution .    another interesting question is the distribution of reference states .",
    "if they would prefer a certain alignment relative to the unknown state , e.g. parallel to them , an experimentalist would not have to use the quite involved adaption procedure described above , but could simply aim for this alignment . as can be seen from fig.[fig : refbk ] , this is not the case .",
    "the reference states have a clear tendency to be on the same hemisphere as the unknown states , but they show a rather broad distribution and do not become completely parallel .",
    "symmetry measurements have been discussed in the context of quantum state estimation .",
    "this measurement concept , based on a comparison , was inspired by those used in classical physics .",
    "it was shown that such a basic measurement scheme leads to a converging estimation of pure qubits .",
    "furthermore , a corresponding adaptive scheme has been formulated and numerically simulated .",
    "however , the achievable fidelities do not reach the fidelity maximum @xmath47 for collective spin measurements @xcite .",
    "this is due to the restriction on simple symmetry considerations . in principle",
    "it would be possible to achieve higher fidelities by further discriminating between basis states of the symmetric subspace .",
    "however , by using such an extension of our scheme , we would sacrifice the concept of symmetry considerations . on the other hand",
    "it would not surpass the adaptive schemes reported in @xcite for standard projection measurements , that already are quite close to @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the presented measurement concept is not challenging the mentioned quantum estimation methods in any practical application .",
    "our aim rather was to demonstrate explicitly the simple principle of a symmetry comparison in quantum estimation problems .",
    "we thank igor jex and ferdinand gleisberg for various discussions .",
