    "transitions between 2d layers is one of fundamental features of double layer structures .",
    "it changes the quantum corrections to the conductivity , especially in a magnetic field parallel to the layers .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the interference of electron waves scattered along closed trajectories in opposite directions ( time - reversed paths ) produces a negative quantum correction to the conductivity .",
    "an external magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) gives the phase difference between pairs of time - reversed paths @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the quantum of magnetic flux , @xmath3 is the area enclosed , and thus destroys the interference and results in negative magnetoresistance .    in case of a single 2d layer",
    "the influence of a magnetic field is strongly anisotropic because all the paths lie in one plane .",
    "the magnetoresistance is maximal for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the normal to 2d layer .",
    "when a magnetic field lies in the 2d layer plane , @xmath6 , the scalar product @xmath7 is zero , i.e. the magnetic field does not destroy the interference , and the negative magnetoresistance is absent in this magnetic field orientation .",
    "@xcite    in coupled double layer structures , the tunneling between layers gives rise to the closed paths where an electron moves initially over one layer then over another one and returns to the first layer .",
    "for this paths the product ( @xmath8 ) is non - zero for any magnetic field orientation and hence the negative magnetoresistance has to appear for @xmath6 as well .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the negative magnetoresistance is determined by the statistics of closed paths , namely , by the area distribution function , @xmath9 , and area dependence of the average length of closed paths , @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite just these statistic dependencies have been studied in single 2d layer structures by analysis of negative magnetoresistance measured at @xmath4.@xcite    the role of inter - layers transitions in weak localization and negative magnetoresistance for @xmath11 for multilayer structures ( superlattices ) was discussed in ref .. the closely related problem concerning the role of inter - subbands transitions in quasi - two dimensional structures with several subbands occupied was theoretically studied in ref .  .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of investigations of the negative magnetoresistance in double layer gaas / ingaas structure for different magnetic field orientations .",
    "we obtain the area distribution functions and area dependencies of the average lengths of the closed paths using the approach developed in refs .  .",
    "these functions are compared with those obtained from the computer simulation of carrier motion when inter - layers transitions are accounted for .",
    "close agreement shows that just the inter - layers transitions determine the negative magnetoresistance in coupled double layer structures .",
    "the double well heterostructure gaas / in@xmath12ga@xmath13as was grown by metal - organic vapor phase epitaxy ( movpe ) on semi - insulator gaas substrate .",
    "the heterostructure consists of a 0.5 @xmath14m - thick undoped gaas epilayer , a si @xmath15-layer , a 75     spacer of undoped gaas , a 100  in@xmath16ga@xmath17as well , a 100    barrier of undoped gaas , a 100    in@xmath16ga@xmath17as well , a 75     spacer of undoped gaas , a si @xmath15-layer and 1000    cap layer of undoped gaas . the samples were * mesa etched * ( cut ? ? ) into standard hall bridges .",
    "the measurements were performed in the temperature range @xmath18 k at low magnetic field up to @xmath19 t with discrete @xmath20 t for two orientations : the magnetic field was perpendicular ( @xmath21 ) and parallel ( @xmath22 ) to the structure plane ( see insert in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "additional high field measurements were also made to characterize the structure .",
    "it has been found that in the structure investigated the conductivity is determined by the electrons in the wells .",
    "their densities have been determined from the fourier analysis of the shubnikov - de haas oscillations and consist of @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xmath26 in different wells .",
    "the hall mobility was about @xmath27 @xmath28 ( v  @xmath29 sec ) .",
    "=    the magnetic field dependencies of in - plane magnetoconductance @xmath30 at magnetic field perpendicular ( @xmath31 ) and parallel ( @xmath32 ) to the structure plane are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "one can see that the negative magnetoresistance is observed for both magnetic field orientations and , in contrast to the case of single layer structures , the effects are comparable in magnitude .",
    "analysis of behaviour of the conductivity in a wide range of temperatures ( @xmath33  k ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath34  t ) shows that at @xmath35  t the main contribution to the negative magnetoresistance comes from the interference correction . in this case the magnetic field dependence of the negative magnetoresistance is determined by the statistics of the closed paths.@xcite    let us apply the method proposed in refs .   to analysis of negative magnetoresistance in the double layer structure . using formalism presented in section ii of ref .",
    "one can write the expression for conductivity of double layer structure with identical layers for two magnetic field orientations as follows @xmath36 here , @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the classical drude conductivity , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the fermi velocity , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the momentum relaxation and phase breaking time , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath44 is the function not only of @xmath45 but @xmath46 as well .",
    "it was defined in ref .   by eq.(6 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that eq .",
    "( [ eqsbl ] ) is valid at low enough probability of inter - layers transitions .",
    "thus , for the magnetic field perpendicular to the structure plane ( @xmath47 ) the magnetoresistance is determined by @xmath48-component of @xmath49 only and for parallel magnetic field ( @xmath50 ) it is determined by @xmath51-component of @xmath52 .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eqsbl ] ) that the fourier transform of @xmath53 @xmath54 carriers an information on @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "because the value of @xmath46 tends to infinity when temperature tends to zero , @xcite the extrapolation of @xmath57-vs-@xmath58 curve to @xmath59 gives the value of @xmath60 .",
    "the ratio @xmath61 for given @xmath62 can be then obtained as @xmath63 .",
    "=    the value @xmath64 , not @xmath65 , is experimentally measured .",
    "it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ eqsbl ] ) that @xmath66 . to obtain @xmath67",
    ", we assume that the drude conductivity @xmath68 is equal to the conductivity at t=20 k , when the quantum corrections are small .",
    "notice that the final results are not sensitive to the value of @xmath68 practically .",
    "obtaining of the distribution function @xmath69 from the experimental @xmath70 dependencies for the structure investigated is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] . in left panel",
    "the fourier transforms of @xmath71 measured at different temperatures are presented .",
    "right panel shows how the @xmath72-vs-@xmath58 data have been extrapolated to @xmath59 .",
    "the area distribution function @xmath73 has been obtained from the analysis of @xmath70 curves in a similar way .",
    "the results of data processing described above are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig30]a .",
    "as is seen the @xmath74 dependence is close to @xmath75 for @xmath76  @xmath77 .",
    "the analogous behaviour of the area distribution function was obtained for single 2d layer in ref .. the behaviour of @xmath69 significantly differs from that of @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath69 curve shows a much steeper decline for @xmath78  @xmath77 .",
    "other feature of the statistics of the closed paths in double layer structure is the fact that for given @xmath45 the values of @xmath79 are significantly larger than @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ fig30]b ) .",
    "=    qualitatively these peculiarities of the statistics of closed paths in double layer structures can be understood if one considers how trajectories with large enough length , @xmath81 , look .",
    "they are isotropically smeared over @xmath82-plane for the distance @xmath83 , their extended area in this plane is @xmath84 . in @xmath85-plane",
    "they have size @xmath83 in @xmath86-direction and @xmath87 ( where @xmath87 is inter - layer distance ) in @xmath48-direction .",
    "so , the extended area in @xmath85-plane is @xmath88 .",
    "thus , closed trajectories have significantly larger @xmath89 than @xmath90 , and the @xmath91 ratio increases with increasing @xmath92 .",
    "it is clear that the behaviour of enclosed areas @xmath93 , @xmath94 is analogous .",
    "therefore , for @xmath95 the inequality @xmath96 is valid .",
    "the average length of the trajectories @xmath79 therewith is greater than @xmath80 .    as was shown in ref .",
    "the distribution function of closed paths , the area dependence of average length of closed paths and weak localization magnetoresistance can be obtained by computer simulation of a carrier motion over 2d plane .",
    "the model double layer system is conceived as two identical plains with randomly distributed scattering centers with a given total cross - section .",
    "every plane is represented as a lattice @xmath97 with lattice parameter @xmath98 .",
    "the scatterers are placed in a part of the lattice sites with the use of a random number generator .",
    "we assume that a particle moves with a constant velocity along straight lines which happen to be terminated by collisions with the scatterers .",
    "after every collision the particle has two possibilities : it passes from one plane to another with a probability @xmath99 and moves over the second plane or it remains in the plane with probability @xmath100 , changing the motion direction only . if the trajectory of the particle passes near the start point at the distance less than @xmath101 ( where @xmath102 is a prescribed value , which is small enough ) , it is perceived as being closed .",
    "the projections of enclosed algebraic area is calculated according to @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 is number of collisions for given trajectory , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 stand for coordinates of @xmath109-th collision , @xmath108 takes the value @xmath110 or @xmath87 .",
    "otherwise the simulation details are analogous to them described in ref .   for the case of single 2d layer system .",
    "all the results presented here have been obtained using the parameters : lattice dimension is @xmath111 ; the number of starts , @xmath112 , is @xmath113 ; the total number of scatterers is about @xmath114 ; the scattering cross section is @xmath115 ; @xmath116 ; @xmath117 .",
    "the value of mean free path computed for such a system is about @xmath118 .",
    "if we suppose the value of @xmath98 equal to @xmath119  , this model double layer system corresponds to the heterostructure investigated .",
    "namely , the mean free path is equal to the value of @xmath120  , and the value of @xmath87 is close to the distance between the centers of the quantum wells , @xmath121  .",
    "the area distribution functions obtained as the result of simulation with different inter - layers transition probabilities are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig40 ] .",
    "let us discuss at first the behaviour of @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ fig40]a ) . for @xmath122 ,",
    "the @xmath123 curve corresponds to the area distribution function for single layer . for large @xmath45",
    "this curve goes close to the @xmath124-dependence , which corresponds to the ideal 2d system in the diffusion regime .",
    "@xcite the deviation , which is evident for @xmath125 , is just due to the transition to the ballistic regime .",
    "it is obviously that for sufficiently large values of @xmath99 , the probability of return to the start point has to be twice smaller than that for @xmath122 .",
    "as is seen from fig.[fig40]a even the value @xmath126 is large enough in this sense : the corresponding curve is close to the @xmath127-dependence practically in whole area range .",
    "this is because the long trajectories with large number of passes between layers give significant contribution to @xmath73 starting from small areas , @xmath128 . for the intermediate value of @xmath99 ( @xmath129 )",
    "the area distribution function is close to the @xmath124 function for small areas and tends to the @xmath127 dependence for large ones .",
    "=    the behaviour of @xmath69 contrasts with that of @xmath73 ( fig.[fig40]b ) . at small @xmath94",
    ", @xmath69 depends only weekly on @xmath94 , whereas at large @xmath94 it decreases sharply when @xmath94 increases .",
    "sensitivity of @xmath69 to inter - layers transition probability depends on @xmath94 value . for small @xmath94 values ,",
    "when the area distribution function is mainly determined by short closed paths with small number of inter - layers transitions , the value of @xmath69 considerably increases with increasing @xmath99 . for large @xmath94 ,",
    "i.e. for paths with large number of inter - layer transitions , @xmath69 weakly depends on the transition probability .",
    "let us demonstrate how the magnetoresistance of our model 2d system changes with changing of the inter - layers transition probability .",
    "the theoretical @xmath130 dependencies have been calculated by summing over the contributions of every closed path to the conductivity in accordance with following expression @xcite @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the length of @xmath133-th closed path .",
    "the results of calculation are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig50 ] , where @xmath134 is plotted against @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "as is seen the changes in magnetic field dependencies of negative magnetoresistance with change of inter - layers transition probability reflect the variation of area distribution functions .",
    "indeed , @xmath137 depends on @xmath99 slightly : maximal change is less than two times for decreasing @xmath99 up to zero , whereas @xmath138 changes drastically .",
    "it decreases about hundred times , when the value of @xmath99 decreases from 0.1 to 0.002 .",
    "let us compare the calculated area distributions with experimental data .",
    "one can see from figs .",
    "[ fig30]a and [ fig40 ] , that the behaviour of calculated and experimental @xmath73 and @xmath69 dependencies is close qualitatively . as mentioned above , @xmath69 depends on inter - layers transition probability significantly stronger than @xmath73 .",
    "therefore we have estimated the transition probability comparing the calculated and experimental @xmath69 curves .",
    "the most accordance has been obtained with @xmath139 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig30]a ) . as seen from the figure , with this value of @xmath99 the calculated @xmath73 dependence describes the experimental data well .",
    "some quantitative inconsistency , especially for @xmath69 , is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig30]a .",
    "we believe , this is result of crudity of model used . in particular , we supposed the identity of both 2d layers .",
    "=    let us turn now to magnetic field dependencies of negative magnetoresistance . to calculate @xmath140 , in addition to the inter - layers transition probability it is necessary to know the phase breaking length . using the value of @xmath126 estimated above",
    ", we have found that the best agreement between theoretical and experimental @xmath141 dependencies is obtained with @xmath142 and @xmath143 @xmath14 m for t=1.5 and 4.2 k , respectively .",
    "the @xmath144 and @xmath145 dependencies calculated with these @xmath46 values practically coincide with those measured experimentally ( see fig.[fig10 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that these values of @xmath46 some differ from those obtained by fitting of the @xmath146 curves to the hikami expression:@xcite the fit gives @xmath147 and @xmath148 @xmath14 m for t=1.5 and 4.2 k , respectively .",
    "the reason of this difference is that the hikami formula was obtained for single 2d layer , and it is not suitable for analysis of negative magnetoresistance in coupled double layers structures .    finally , knowing the values of @xmath99 and @xmath46 we are able to compare the calculated and experimental area dependencies of @xmath79 to @xmath80 ratio ( fig.[fig30]b ) .",
    "it is seen that the experimental ratio is significantly larger than unity as well as calculated one . however , the experimental points lie somewhat below than calculated curve .",
    "we suppose that the main reason of such disagreement is dissimilarity of the layers in structure investigated .",
    "after this paper has been prepared for publication , the paper by raichev and vasilopoulos on the theory of weak localization in double quantum wells is appeared in condensed matter e - print archive.@xcite let us apply this theory to our case . using the formulae derived in ref .  , we have calculated @xmath149 dependencies for our structure .",
    "these dependencies are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] by dashed curves .",
    "as is clearly seen , theory developed in ref . describes our experimental results only in low magnetic fields .",
    "the reason is that the calculations in ref .",
    "were carried out in the framework of diffusion approximation .",
    "it means that two conditions are met .",
    "the first condition is @xmath150 . for",
    "the structure investigated @xmath151 for different temperatures , and this condition may be considered as fulfilled . according to the second condition , the magnetic field has to be low enough : @xmath152 when @xmath153 , or @xmath154 when @xmath155 . in our case @xmath156 t , @xmath157 and hence the diffusion approximation",
    "is applicable , when @xmath158 or @xmath159 t depending on the magnetic field orientation .",
    "it is in this range of magnetic field that the results of ref .",
    "are close to our experimental data .",
    "our calculations are valid beyond the diffusion approximation and therefore they better describe the experimental results in whole magnetic field range , where weak localization correction to the conductivity is dominant .",
    "we have investigated the negative magnetoresistance in double layer heterostructures for different magnetic field orientations .",
    "the information about statistics of closed paths has been extracted from the analysis of temperature and magnetic field dependencies of conductivity .",
    "significant difference in area distribution functions , @xmath69 , @xmath73 , and in average lengths of closed paths , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , has been found . in order to interpret the experimental results , we have investigated the statistics of closed paths and negative magnetoresistance using the computer simulation of the carrier motion with scattering over two 2d layers .",
    "analysis of experimental and theoretical results unambiguously shows that in parallel magnetic field the negative magnetoresistance in double layer structures is determined by inter - layers transitions .",
    "in fact , in single 2d layer structures the longitudinal negative magnetoresistance is observed too , but its magnitude is significantly less than the magnitude of transverse magnetoresistance . in the structures with one subband filled this effect arises due to asymmetry of the wave function or scattering potential with respect to the center of 2d layer.@xcite"
