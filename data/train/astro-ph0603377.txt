    "the connection between long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and supernovae ( sne ) that arise from the core collapse of very massive stars stands on firm footing ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "circumstantial evidence includes the location of grbs near sites of massive star formation @xcite and the detection of unusual `` bumps '' in the grb afterglow light curves that mimic a sn light curve and its colors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more importantly , there are two cases of direct associations : the temporal and spatial coincidence between sn  1998bw and grb  980425 @xcite and the metamorphosis of the grb  030329 spectrum into that of a supernova , called sn  2003dh @xcite . based on spectra ,",
    "sn  1998bw and sn  2003dh were classified as peculiar type ic sne ( sne ic ) , that is , core - collapse sne that showed no hydrogen nor helium in their spectra , but unusually high expansion velocities requiring high explosion energies @xcite , in line with the collapsar model for long - duration grbs @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence of spectroscopically confirmed supernovae for other grbs , however with less confidence @xcite .",
    "spectral confirmation of grb - related sne is crucial since spectra provide understanding of the velocity and nucleosynthesis structure of the ejecta and give an insight into the energetics of the sn explosion .",
    "here we report on the spectral and photometric evolution of grb  060218/sn  2006aj .    on 2006",
    "february 18 , at 03:34:30 ut , the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard the @xmath4 gamma - ray burst explorer detected the bright grb  060218 @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 xrt and @xmath4 uvot also detected its afterglow in the x - ray @xcite and optical bands @xcite , that lead to a precise determination of the optical counterpart s position as @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( equinox j2000.0 ) @xcite .",
    "grb  060218  lasted about 2000 seconds @xcite , establishing it as one of the longest grbs , and had peculiar gamma - ray and x - ray afterglow properties @xcite . due to the unusual properties and relative brightness of grb  060218 , extensive and rapid follow - up observations in all wavelength bands ensued around the globe .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy , that had been detected in pre - burst images by sdss @xcite , and of the optical transient ( ot ) were undertaken by several groups .",
    "their spectra revealed a blue continuum due to the afterglow light , narrow host galaxy emission lines at a redshift of @xmath7=0.033 @xcite and broad spectral features characteristic of a supernova ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which was designated sn  2006aj ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "sn  2006aj was visible at @xmath8 days ( where @xmath9 is time after burst ) in the restframe of the grb @xcite , much earlier than in grb  030329/sn  2003dh  ( where the sn was visible at @xmath10 8 days in the rest frame ) . with a redshift of @xmath7=0.033 ,",
    "this is the lowest - redshift grb / sn after grb  980425/sn  1998bw  ( @xmath11 ) , and closer than grb  030329/sn  2003dh  at @xmath12 .",
    "due to its proximity and early emergence of the sn , a densely time - sampled and high - quality study of grb  060218/sn  2006aj  can shed light on grb - related core - collapse sne , their explosion mechanism and progenitor history . here",
    "we present such a dataset of spectroscopic and photometric observations .",
    "after the announcement of the sn - grb association via the gcn , we promptly established our monitoring program of grb  060218/sn  2006aj .",
    "spectra and photometry were obtained on a nearly nightly basis starting ut 2006 february 22 with the 6.5 m multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) and the 1.5 m tillinghast and 1.2 m telescopes at the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) .",
    "the spectrographs utilized were the blue channel @xcite at the mmt , and fast @xcite at the flwo 1.5 m telescope .",
    "all optical spectra were reduced and calibrated employing standard techniques in iraf and our own idl routines for flux calibration .",
    "all of our photometry data were obtained with the flwo 1.2-m telescope . in this paper",
    "we report on 26 @xmath13-band points obtained between 2006 february 22 and march 13 ut , i.e. between 4 and 23 days after the burst .",
    "the light curve was extracted using the isis2 image subtraction package @xcite . to obtain absolute calibration , we observed landolt standards @xcite on 2006 march 4 ut . the derived transformation coefficients and color terms were used to calibrate a sequence of 9 stars near sn  2006aj . for future references and cross - calibrations",
    ", this transformation gives @xmath14 mag for the sdss star at @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( equinox j2000.0 ) .",
    "the absolute photometric calibration is thought to be accurate to @xmath05% .",
    "we note that our calibration yields comparison star magnitudes in the sdss @xmath17 system ( using the transformation equations of @xcite ) that are fainter than given in @xcite .",
    "the offsets in the respective bands are : + 0.81 mag ( @xmath18 ) , + 0.40 mag ( @xmath19 ) , + 0.27 mag ( @xmath13 ) , + 0.20 mag ( @xmath20 ) , + 0.23 mag ( @xmath21 ) and + 0.15 mag ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "using the same transformation , we obtain @xmath23  mag for the host galaxy , using data from @xcite and our own landolt calibrations .",
    "figure  [ mont_fig ] shows a montage of our spectra , corrected for a galactic extinction of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "we do not correct for host - galaxy extinction , which is constrained to be small , namely @xmath250.04 mag from the equivalent widths of na  i  d lines in high - resolution spectra @xcite . on top of a smooth powerlaw continuum that is typical of grb afterglows are undulations characteristic of a `` broad - lined '' type ic supernova : broad blends of and  @xmath26 , while no hydrogen or helium absorption lines are detected .",
    "the sn signatures are visible in our earliest spectrum at observed @xmath9=3.97 days and become stronger as a function of time .",
    "the narrow lines are common nebular lines and identified as h@xmath27 , [ ]  @xmath28 , h@xmath29 , and [ ]  @xmath30  at @xmath2 arising from regions in the host galaxy .",
    "assuming @xmath31 = 0.3 , @xmath32 = 0.7 and @xmath33 = 72  @xmath34 , this corresponds to a luminosity distance of 143 mpc .",
    "using the value for the fluence detected by @xmath35 @xcite , grb  060218 appears to be an underluminous event in gamma rays : the isotropic equivalent energy amounts to @xmath36 erg ( extrapolated to 1@xmath3710,000 kev band in the grb rest frame ) , which is @xmath38 that of cosmological grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but larger than for grb  980425/sn  1998bw .",
    "the gamma - ray peak luminosity is @xmath39 @xmath40  ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ vlc_fig ] presents our early @xmath13-band light curve for grb  060218/sn  2006aj  ( filled circles ) .",
    "in addition to our flwo 1.2-m data , we have added some data from the literature to extend our time coverage , namely four early @xmath13-band points from @xmath4-uvot as reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite present @xmath35 early - time data ( @xmath41 sec or 11.6 days ) of grb  060218/sn  2006aj  and argue for tantalizing evidence of an observed thermal shock - breakout along with the grb afterglow thousands of seconds after the collapse of the core . our @xmath13-band data clearly show a second peak and the shape of a `` supernova bump '' . the combined grb afterglow / shock breakout decline very quickly and",
    "the sn component dominates the ot light early on ( @xmath42 days ) and certainly when our spectra were obtained . at those times , sn  2006aj  is @xmath43 times brighter than the host galaxy . to compare the behavior of this bump",
    ", we used the @xmath13-band light curve of sn  1998bw @xcite , shifted to @xmath44 and dimmed by @xmath45mag due to the galactic extinction @xcite ( dotted line in figure  [ vlc_fig ] ) .",
    "we find that the sn  2006aj associated with grb060218 evolved much faster than sn  1998bw . indeed",
    ", we find a good fit to our @xmath13-band data if we stretch the time - axis of the light curve of sn  1998bw by a  stretch factor \" of @xmath46 .",
    "the combined fit of the @xmath23  mag host galaxy @xcite added to the stretched sn  1998bw @xmath13-band light curve dimmed by @xmath47mag is shown with the solid line .",
    "our @xmath13 band light curve of sn  2006aj   peaks at @xmath9 = 10.0 @xmath48 0.5 days ( i.e. 2006 february 28.15 ut and at @xmath9 = 9.7 days in the rest frame of sn  2006aj ) at an apparent magnitude @xmath49 = 17.45 @xmath48 0.05 mag . after correcting for a galactic extinction of @xmath24  and host galaxy light contamination , this value corresponds to a peak absolute magnitude of @xmath50 = @xmath51 0.2 mag for sn  2006aj .",
    "the risetime for sn  2006aj  is the shortest ever measured for a sn ic and is significantly shorter than for grb  980425/sn  1998bw  and grb  030329/sn  2003dh  ( @xmath52 days : @xcite ) , while sn  2006aj  is as almost bright as sn  1998bw .",
    "this is an unusual behavior compared to the sample of grb - related sne ( see fig . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "we note that there is a hint of a short plateau phase between @xmath53 days after the burst . _",
    "thus , we conclude that sn  2006aj is a fast - evolving sn , and that the sn dominated the light of the ot .",
    "_    in order to study the sn component of grb  060218/sn  2006aj  more closely , we plot in figure  [ mmt_fig ] our mmt spectrum from ut 2006 march 03 , at @xmath54 12.85 days , thus @xmath0 3 days after @xmath13 maximum , when the sn fully dominates the total light output . the broad absorption trough at 5900   ( rest wavelength ) due to blueshifted  @xmath26  is visible , as well as the broad blends at @xmath04400  , while no lines of hydrogen or helium are detected .",
    "for comparison , we show spectra of other type ic sne at similar phases : the classical sn  1998bw @xcite , the sne  1997ef ( @xcite ) and 2002ap ( @xcite , m. modjaz et al , in preparation ) . the spectrum of sn  2006aj  exhibits features that are more well - defined and narrow than those of sn  1998bw , which indicates that the expansion velocities in sn  2006aj  were lower than in sn  1998bw and by extension , in sn  2003dh .",
    "our earlier spectra of sn  2006aj  in addition to this spectrum are very similar to those of sn  1997ef and sn  2002ap , which are broad - lined sne that had no obvious association with grbs , and are thought to be due to less energetic explosions than sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "this visual match is supported by cross - correlating the spectra with our comprehensive library of sn ic and grb / sn spectra ( m. modjaz et al .",
    ", in preparation ) via our sn - identification algorithm ( @xcite , s. blondin et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "thus , the spectra of sne associated with grbs seem to display a certain variety of expansion velocities . considering both the light curve and spectral properties of sn  2006aj ,",
    "we conclude that its expansion velocities lie between that of sn  1998bw and of sn  2002ap , while a large synthesized @xmath55ni mass is needed to explain the large luminosity in addition to a geometry and ejecta mass that support the fast escape of photons .",
    "we encourage polarization studies and nebular line spectroscopy to constrain the geometry of the explosion . also , late - time observations should give a cleaner window into the core of the ejecta and help constrain density distribution and the abundance of nucleosynthesis products .",
    "for the adopted luminosity distance of 143 mpc , the pre - burst broadband sdss photometry yields an absolute magnitude for the host galaxy of @xmath3 .",
    "this value is less than that of the small magellanic cloud , a dwarf galaxy with @xmath56 mag .",
    "we generated a spectrum of the host galaxy emission lines by averaging the mmt spectra and subtracting a lower - order fit to the continuum .",
    "the emission line fluxes were measured with the @xmath57 task in iraf and are given here corrected for galactic extinction and normalized to h@xmath29 ( where f(h@xmath29)= 0.9 @xmath58 ergs @xmath59 s@xmath60 ) : h@xmath29=1.0 , h@xmath27=3.0 , h@xmath61=0.3 , [ ]  @xmath62 = 1.2 , [ ]  @xmath28 = 4.0 , [ ]  @xmath30=1.6 , and [ ]  @xmath63@xmath640.2 ( not detected , 1 @xmath65 upper limit ) .",
    "comparison of the line fluxes with the broadband sdss photometry @xcite indicates that the host galaxy contribution to the continuum flux is negligible and becomes important only at very short wavelengths ( @xmath66  ) .",
    "the relative strengths of the balmer lines indicate little host galaxy extinction with @xmath67 mag .",
    "we derive an integrated h@xmath27 luminosity of @xmath68 @xmath40 , which translates to a current star formation rate of @xmath69 m@xmath70@xcite .",
    "this lower limit is relatively high for such an underluminous galaxy . in order to derive the metallicity of the host system",
    ", we used the @xmath71 iterative diagnostic that involves the emission line ratios of [ ]  @xmath30 , [ ]  @xmath28 , [ ]  @xmath63  and h@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we derive an ionization parameter of @xmath72 @xmath73  and an oxygen abundance of @xmath74 , which corresponds to about @xmath75 , assuming a solar abundance of @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "we note that the @xmath71 diagnostic also possesses an upper branch that predicts an oxygen abundance of @xmath77 .",
    "however , this upper branch is excluded by considering the upper limit on [ ]  @xmath63  ( see fig . 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the higher oxygen abundance would predict a much brighter host galaxy according to the luminosity - metallicity relationship ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the host - galaxy of grb  060218/sn  2006aj  is a low - metallicity , low - luminosity galaxy , very similar to those of other grb / sn ( e.g. , @xcite ) and those of more distant grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have presented early photometric and spectroscopic data on grb  060218/sn  2006aj  that clearly establish sn  2006aj as a fast - evolving broad - lined type ic sn with an extremely short rise - time and a large optical peak luminosity at @xmath7 = 0.0335 .",
    "the spectra indicate large expansion velocities that are smaller than those found in the proto - typical grb - related sn  1998bw .",
    "the host - galaxy appears to be a low - metallicity dwarf galaxy .",
    "we would like to thank the staffs of the mmt observatory and flwo .",
