    "satellite galaxies have attracted an enormous amount of observational and theoretical study over the past decade .",
    "this is partly a consequence of the hierarchical nature of galaxy formation in the currently - popular @xmath2cdm models , within which some or all dwarf satellites may represent left - over building blocks from an earlier assembly phase of large galaxies .",
    "these models also suffer from the so - called ` substructure problem ' @xcite , in that the predicted numbers of low - mass dark matter haloes are far larger than the observed numbers of low - luminosity galaxies that might naturally be expected to occupy them .",
    "the problem has been addressed in the latest models @xcite by decreasing or completely suppressing the star - formation ( sf ) efficiency in low mass haloes .",
    "one great success of these models was that they predicted the existence of ultra - low mass dwarf galaxies substantially fainter than the canonical dwarf spheroidals .",
    "these ultra - faint dwarfs were subsequently discovered , primarily through searches of data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "satellites are also potentially of importance in other areas of galaxy physics . merging of low - mass satellites with their central hosts ( minor mergers ) is one route for the formation of thick disk components , and for building bulges .",
    "for example , @xcite cite repeated minor merger episodes as their preferred mechanism through which bulges can grow without destroying the surrounding disk , thus preserving the strong correlation between disk and bulge colours within individual galaxies found by these authors",
    ". another important problem concerns the continued gas supply to large disk galaxies , first noted by @xcite .",
    "these authors estimate that the milky way ( mw ) will consume the current disk gas reservoir in @xmath32  gyr , and that the equivalent timescale for 36 external galaxies is little longer , with a mean of 3.9  gyr , and certainly less than a hubble time .",
    "this points clearly to the need for continued gas supply to support ongoing sf in most or all spiral galaxies . such continued or even increasing supply",
    "is also indicated by the k - dwarf metallicity distribution in the mw , investigated by @xcite , who also conclude that the ` burstiness ' apparent in the sf history of the mw may indicate significant gas accretion events . however , @xcite estimate the total gas mass in the current populations of satellites around the mw and m31 ( not including the magellanic clouds ) , finding a total of only 1 - 2@xmath4 m@xmath5 for the mw .",
    "they conclude that this is too little to provide a satisfactory explanation of the deficiency of low - metallicity dwarf stars in the galactic disk ( the ` g - dwarf problem ' ) , which requires a continued supply at an average rate of @xmath31  m@xmath5  yr@xmath6 over a period of 5 - 7  gyr .",
    "much of the recent interest in satellites has concentrated on extremely low - luminosity dwarf galaxies , which in general can only be studied within the local group . however , the more massive satellites are also of substantial importance . in this paper",
    "we focus on satellites that are near analogues of the two most luminous objects around the mw , the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , collectively mc , henceforth ) which are characterised by quite high masses and luminosities ( much higher at least than any other galaxies within several hundred kpc of the milky way ) , ongoing sf indicating substantial gas reservoirs , and their nearness to us ( 50 and 60  kpc for the lmc and smc respectively ) . they also appear to be close to one another , probably forming a bound pair , with an interaction history that may be of great importance , both for their sf histories and for the origin of the magellanic stream of hi gas .    for comparison with the satellite galaxies found in the present study , we assume @xmath1-band luminosities of 1.6@xmath710@xmath8 and 3.7@xmath710@xmath9  l@xmath5 , and sf rates of 0.17 and 0.027  m@xmath5  yr@xmath6 for the lmc and smc respectively .",
    "the latter are derived from the h@xmath0 photometry of @xcite with magnitude - dependent extinction corrections derived following @xcite . again for comparison purposes , we adopt an @xmath1-band luminosity for the milky way of 1.5@xmath710@xmath10  l@xmath5 ; thus to a distant observer , the milky way would appear 9.4 times more luminous than the lmc , a difference of 2.43  mag . ; and 40.5 times more luminous than the smc , a difference of 4.02  mag .",
    "one reason for looking for satellites like the lmc and smc lies in the recent simulations , discussed above in the context of ultra - faint dwarfs . while these models have had great success in accounting for the luminosity function of low - mass satellites ( @xmath11 l@xmath12 , most fail to predict the existence of satellites resembling the magellanic clouds in any significant numbers . for example , @xcite find satellites as massive as the lmc in fewer than 5% of simulated haloes that harbour mw - like central galaxies .",
    "@xcite also find that their models , which rely on reionization to truncate sf in satellite haloes , accurately explain the numbers of faint satellites but again do not predict mc - like satellites .",
    "@xcite confirm that the underprediction of the numbers of the brightest satellites for mw - like systems occurs even in the most recent @xmath2cdm simulations .",
    "@xmath2cdm simulations of the satellite populations of mw - like galaxies by @xcite also fail to match the observed luminosity function of local group satellites in their brightest bin , which comprises the lmc and smc . as a result",
    "these authors introduce additional models with parameters tuned to allow the production of mc - like satellites .",
    "similarly , @xcite recently produced models of mw - like haloes where the whole sf efficiency model is tuned to produce smc- and lmc - like satellites .",
    "@xcite analyse the statistical properties of haloes likely to host mw - like galaxies in the millennium - ii @xmath2cdm simulation , and determine the probability of hosting a satellite as massive as the lmc to be 8 - 25% , depending on the mass adopted for the mw halo ( larger masses corresponding to higher probabilities ) .",
    "similarly , they find the probabilities of having a second satellite as massive as the smc to be in the range 3.3 - 20% .",
    "they argue from this analysis that the existence of the lmc and smc favours the higher end of the mw halo mass range .",
    "however , higher mass favours more recent and substantial mergers in the past history , making the survival of the mw thin disk harder to understand .",
    "this raises obvious questions about how typical the magellanic clouds are .    as one counter - example to the above studies , @xcite and @xcite presented disk galaxy @xmath13-body / sph simulations which _ do _ predict the existence of massive satellites resembling the magellanic clouds , which they take as confirmation of the validity of their models .",
    "again , the strength of this argument depends on whether the mw system is a special case in this respect .",
    "magellanic cloud - like satellites are also important because of their potentially significant impact on the growth of stellar mass in disk galaxies .",
    "@xcite present simulations of mergers of disk galaxies with ` live ' ( dynamically interacting ) haloes , which show that mw - mass disks can survive mergers with satellites one - third of their mass while remaining recognisable disks , while mergers with satellites of the mass of the lmc have almost no effect , causing only some disk thickening .",
    "even this effect is found to be negligible for satellites less than one - tenth of the central galaxy mass .",
    "their models also predict a rapid , radial infall of satellites , almost regardless of their initial impact trajectory .",
    "however it is not clear whether this prediction is consistent with the multiply - wound satellite trails around some nearby galaxies , e.g. those around ngc  5907 found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite present similar modelling , but they focus on the effect of mass loss from the satellite during the accretion process , which they find to have a substantial effect on dynamical friction timescales . applying this to the lmc , they predict it is likely to merge with the mw on a @xmath34  gyr timescale .",
    "overall , these simulations show that mergers with mc - like satellites provide a plausible mechanism for the fast and efficient growth of disk galaxies , providing of course such satellites exist in significant numbers .",
    "however , the assumption that our galaxy is ` typical ' in any sense , whilst frequently made , is very risky ; this is a sample of one galaxy that may be unusual in some respects .",
    "an early test of this assumption was performed by @xcite who searched for satellite galaxies around nearby field galaxies using palomar sky atlas photographic plates .",
    "he found that bright satellite galaxies comparable to the mc are quite rare , at least within @xmath357  kpc projected distance from the central galaxies studied .",
    "this conclusion was supported by @xcite , who used higher - quality photographic material and concluded that a typical spiral central galaxy only has one satellite brighter than @xmath1416.5 within a projected separation of 375  kpc .",
    "@xcite present a spectroscopic study of 62 nearby bright spiral galaxies , finding 69 confirmed satellites around 45 of these central galaxies .",
    "the 69 satellites have absolute @xmath15 mags between 20 and 13 , with the bulk of the distribution between 18 and 14 .",
    "nine of the 69 are as bright as or brighter than the lmc , with the smc being close to the median luminosity .    here",
    "we present a study that aims to build on these results , using narrow - band imaging to search for satellite galaxies around disk galaxies in the local universe .",
    "in addition to these statistical goals , a strong motivation for this work is to identify the best analogues of the mc system , to provide a comparison sample for further studies of , for example , the origin of the magellanic stream .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a hubble constant of 70  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , although for the nearer galaxies we adopt distances corrected for virgo cluster infall only , taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the major problem in assembling catalogues of satellite galaxies is background or foreground interloper galaxies , which appear to be companions through line - of - sight projection .",
    "these can be statistically accounted for by subtracting counts from comparison fields , as was done by @xcite , but this is a highly uncertain procedure due to clustering , and the small ` signal ' of true satellites .",
    "multi - object spectroscopy is the most secure way to overcome this problem , but it is time consuming given that the input catalogues are heavily contaminated by background sources , and that satellites can be faint and of low surface brightness .",
    "many of these problems can be overcome by using narrow - band imaging , through a filter with a passband that includes a bright emission line ( h@xmath0 in the present paper ) at the redshift of the central galaxy or galaxies targeted .",
    "this has the advantages that it can be used over wide fields given current large - format ccds , each field requires just two observations ( through the narrow - band h@xmath0 filter , and a shorter exposure through a broader filter for continuum subtraction ) , and only sources with an emission line within the narrower filter passband will appear in the continuum - subtracted image , thus excluding almost all background and foreground galaxies due to the redshifting of the target emission line out of the passband of the filter .",
    "in addition , h@xmath0 narrow - band imaging is highly sensitive to even low levels of star formation ; hii regions tend to be clumpy and of high surface brightness , even in generally lsb galaxies .",
    "the major limitation of this technique is that it only picks up the star - forming galaxies within the field , and has no sensitivity for quiescent galaxies such as most elliptical and dwarf elliptical types .",
    "however , the star - forming satellite galaxies are the most relevant ones if the goal is to identify potential suorces of gas supply to central galaxies .",
    "it is important here to note the conclusion of recent papers @xcite , which find that almost all gas - rich galaxies in the local universe form stars .",
    "thus to a good approximation h@xmath0 selection can be considered equivalent to selecting of galaxies with significant cold gas content , although we note some interesting ( but apparently rare ) cases of galaxies with high molecular gas contents which have very low sf rates , e.g. for the galaxies in stephan s quintet @xcite .",
    "the methods used in the present paper were first tested using data from the h@xmath0gs survey @xcite , with results being presented in @xcite .",
    "we looked at continuum - subtracted narrow - band h@xmath0 imaging for 119 central galaxies , finding a total of 9 probable star - forming satellites .",
    "the typical @xmath1-band luminosities and h@xmath0-derived sf rates of the 9 satellites were similar to those of the smc , with the lmc being more luminous than all 9 and having a sf rate larger than 8 of the 9 . no central galaxy was found to have more than one star - forming satellite .",
    "thus the overall conclusion was that mc - like bright , star forming satellites seem to be uncommon . however , it is important to note some significant caveats with the results presented in @xcite .",
    "the ccd imaging used for h@xmath0gs had a relatively small areal coverage ( @xmath3 10@xmath16 squared ) so there are substantial incompleteness corrections . also , the relatively small volume of the local universe used to select the central galaxies , and the aim for complete sampling of dwarf galaxies , resulted in a restricted number of bright central galaxies .",
    "thus , for example , only 31 of the central galaxies studied in @xcite are brighter than 10@xmath10 l@xmath5 and can thus be considered truly comparable with the mw .",
    "a potentially important additional consideration with the narrow - band imaging technique is that uncertainties in the continuum subtraction process can result in spurious objects which do not in fact have any line emission . even for",
    "those objects where the line emission is real , the narrow - band imaging alone can not rule out the possibility of it being another line , for example [ o iii]@xmath175007    redshifted into the narrow - band filter passband .",
    "finally , even if it is truly the h@xmath0 line , the width of the narrow - band filters used here ( 80 - 100   ) means that galaxies not truly associated with the central galaxy , separated by distances as large as 30  mpc assuming pure hubble expansion , may be included as potential satellites .",
    "however , spectroscopy of 13 of our candidate satellites @xcite has confirmed that in every case , the emission revealed in the narrow - band imaging was truly h@xmath0 emission , very close in recession velocity to that of the central galaxies ( a maximum difference of 263  km  s@xmath6 , and a mean difference of only 116  km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "thus we have good confidence that virtually all of the sources discussed in the present paper are true satellites , genuinely associated with the central galaxies , with very small contamination by interlopers .",
    "this study utilises the same methods as @xcite , but a completely independent dataset , with very different selection criteria . h@xmath0 imaging was obtained for galaxies hosting recent core - collapse sne , for a study of the environments immediately surrounding the locations of the sn @xcite giving constraints on progenitor stars .",
    "selection by core - collapse sn occurrence naturally weights the sample towards the brightest and most rapidly star - forming galaxies , making this an excellent complementary sample to that used in @xcite .",
    "the overall galaxy sample is listed in @xcite , and so we do not go into detail here on the sample selection or data reduction .",
    "we use all data taken with the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the isaac newton telescope using either filter number 197 ( h@xmath0 , central wavelength 6568   ) or 227 ( redshifted h@xmath0 , central wavelength 6657   ) , where the numbers are from the isaac newton group filter database .",
    "these filters cover all recession velocities from 0 - 6100  km  s@xmath6 , with a transition point between the two of @xmath32400  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we do not include galaxies from the sample of @xcite that were observed using the [ sii ] filter centred on 6725    ( which are too distant for unambiguous detection of faint satellites ) or those observed with the liverpool telescope ( where the field of view of the ccd camera is too small for an efficient satellite search ) .",

    "[ fig : thist ] . a small number of galaxies with no specific type classifications in ned were classified by the first author , based on our own @xmath1-band images .",
    "selection by core - collapse supernova occurrence weights the sample strongly towards bright , star - forming spirals of types sb - scd ; these constitute 70% of the current sample ( 100/143 ) .",
    "this closely matches the 66% contribution of galaxies of these types to the total star - formation density of the local universe , as found by @xcite , and thus this appears to be a representative sample of star - forming galaxies at the present epoch .    [ cols= \" < ,",

    "given the passband of the filters used , it should be noted that throughout this paper , ` h@xmath0 ' in fact refers to both h@xmath0 and [ nii ] 6548 & 6584    emission ; no attempt is made to correct for the latter .",
    "the satellite search was done by eye , scanning the continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 images for clear emission - line objects , and ` blinking ' such objects with the spatially - registered @xmath1-band images to confirm that there was a coincident source with detectable emission in the broader filter ( noting that the latter includes h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the scanning of images for satellites was done independently by both authors .",
    "thus for the present paper , a ` satellite ' is an object with emission in both images , that is separated from the main body of the central galaxy .",
    "given the aims of the present paper , any companions with an @xmath1-band luminosity more than one - third of that of the central galaxy were not included in our analysis or statistics .",
    "however , it is important to bear in mind that there is no universal definition of ` satellite ' when comparing different studies , many of which do include such bright companion galaxies .",
    "only the central ccd ( number 4 ) of the wfc 4-chip array was used for the satellite search , to avoid complications caused by the gaps between the ccds , and vignetting losses affecting the outer corners of the array .",
    "the area of the single ccd is @xmath3 12@xmath1924@xmath16 , corresponding to 111@xmath7221  kpc at the median distance ( 31.7  mpc , 2220  km  s@xmath6 ) of the galaxies searched in this study , or @xmath20",
    "190@xmath7379  kpc for the galaxies in the upper quartile of distance .",
    "thus incompleteness is very small for satellites as close to their central galaxies as are the magellanic clouds to the milky way ( 50 & 60 kpc ) , but a significant fraction of satellites at the virial radii of the host systems ( typically 200 - 300  kpc ) will be missed .",
    "this incompleteness can be quantified to some extent using the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "briefly , this involves calculating the fraction of a circular volume centred on each of the central galaxies that would be visible , with the ` invisible ' regions being both those lying off the ccd , and those projected onto the disk of the central galaxy .",
    "these fractions can then be summed for the whole sample and divided by the number of central galaxies to give an estimated completeness fraction , under the assumption of uniformly distributed satellites .",
    "this was first done for the present sample using the ` magellanic radius ' defined in @xcite ; this is the radius ( 76  kpc ) corresponding to a sphere with twice the volume necessary to include both magellanic clouds .",
    "overall , we sample about 75% of this volume for the 143 galaxies in the current sample , with the most substantial loss being for galaxies closer than 20  mpc . beyond 30 mpc",
    ", we see the full volume out to the magellanic radius , apart from the cylinder comprising about 5% of the total volume that is projected against the central galaxy disk . for greater central - satellite separations ,",
    "the incompleteness obviously becomes larger ; repeating the above calculation for a radius of 200  kpc , we find that we can only see 34% of the corresponding volume .",
    "however , the @xmath2cdm models of @xcite predict that only a very small fraction of satellites lies as far out as 200  kpc , and that between 70 and 90% ( depending on the model parameters used ) lie within 100  kpc of the simulated central galaxy .",
    "our survey efficiency for a 100  kpc radius sphere is 64% .",
    "overall , we conclude that we should pick up about 50% of all satellites , and 75% of those within the ` magellanic radius ' .",
    "the main results of the satellite search are summarised in table  [ tab_ttype ] .",
    "the total number of central galaxies searched was 143 , approximately one - third of which were found to have at least one associated line - emitting galaxy .",
    "of these 47 central hosts , 37 have only a single satellite , 7 have two satellites , 2 have three satellites and one ( ngc  3074 ) has five satellites ; thus the 47 central galaxies host a total of 62 satellites .",
    "the @xmath18-types of the central galaxies for each of the 62 is shown as the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : thist ] ; this matches the type distribution for all galaxies searched within statistical uncertainties , i.e. there is no evidence for any galaxy type having systematically more or fewer satellites than the average .",
    "the mean and median recession velocities of the satellite - hosting galaxies are 2938 and 2543  km  s@xmath6 respectively , somewhat larger than the corresponding values for the whole sample of 143 galaxies ( 2539 and 2217  km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "this indicates that the dominant incompleteness is likely to be due to the smaller effective search area for the nearer systems , rather than missing faint satellites at larger distances . in any case ,",
    "the recession velocity distributions of the overall and satellite - hosting samples are only marginally different , with a kolmogorov - smirnov test showing a 21% chance that they could be drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "our @xmath1-band imaging and the catalogued recession velocities were used to determine the total luminosities of the central hosts .",
    "the mean value for the 47 satellite - hosting galaxies was 1.53@xmath710@xmath10 l@xmath5 , almost identical to our adopted luminosity for the mw , thus confirming that this is a good sample for deriving satellite properties of mw - like central galaxies .",

    "[ fig : rmagdiff ] is fairly similar to that found by @xcite for their sample of 69 satellites ; they find the magnitude difference distribution to rise to a peak at 3 - 3.5  mag , with a tail out to @xmath37.5  mag .",
    "figure  [ fig : sepmagdiff ] combines the two parameters discussed above , host - satellite luminosity difference and host - satellite spatial separation , in one scatter plot that enables an overall comparison of the 62 satellites with the smc and lmc , the latter being plotted as asterisks .",
    "the dotted lines are chosen , somewhat arbitrarily , to indicate satellites that might be considered most closely analogous to the smc and lmc .",
    "the top and bottom horizontal lines correspond to satellites with one - half of the normalised luminosity of the smc , and double the normalised luminosity of the lmc , respectively .",
    "the central line corresponds to both double the smc normalised luminosity , and half the lmc luminosity ( noting that within errors , the lmc is four times as bright as the smc ) .",

    "some conclusions are apparent from this figure . relative to these boundaries , three satellites are _ significantly _",
    "brighter than the lmc ; two of these ( in the bottom right - hand box ) are at substantial projected distances from their host galaxies and might better be consider as binary companions or group members .",
    "all three of these bright satellites have luminosities close to one - third that of their hosts . there are 9 satellites within a factor 2 of the normalised lmc luminosity , of which 3 are distant companions but 6 are sufficiently close in projected separation to be considered ` mc - like '",

    "three of these pairs have projected separations of 41 - 42  kpc , substantially greater than the current lmc - smc distance .",
    "the closest pair , at 13  kpc projected separation , are the two innermost satellites of ngc  3074 .",
    "probably the best candidates for a bound pair are the two objects associated with ngc  4675 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n4675 ] ) , with a projected separation of only 23  kpc , while the mean distance from the pair to the central galaxy is almost 7 times as large .",
    "one question regarding this putative pair is whether they might be regarded as a central - satellite system in their own right , given that the brighter galaxy of the pair is one of the 3 ` very bright ' satellites , substantially more luminous than the lmc .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the only previous search specifically for star - forming satellites that has been reported in the literature is our own study using the h@xmath0gs data , @xcite . given that identical methods were used , it is not surprising that the present study confirms the main result of @xcite ; the large majority of central galaxies do not host star - forming satellites .",
    "this conclusion is unlikely to be changed by the levels of incompleteness identified in section  [ ssec : datred ] above .",
    "the present study does , however , find larger numbers of satellites per central galaxy searched than the ratio of 1 satellite per 13 central galaxies found by @xcite ; this may be largely to do with the higher typical luminosities of the central galaxies surveyed in the present study . to summarise our numbers for comparison with other studies , fig .",

    ", these observed numbers should be multiplied by 1.35 . extending this to all galactocentric radii , fig .",
    "[ fig : sepmagdiff ] shows 3 bright , 9 lmc - like , 22 smc - like and 28 faint satellites , which should be multiplied by 1.96 to correct for volume incompleteness .",
    "@xcite searched for satellites around 174 galaxies out to a galactocentric radius of @xmath357  kpc ( after correction to h@xmath23=70 ) .",
    "he found 274 ` physical ' companions ( i.e. after a statistical background subtraction ) .",
    "for a subset of 53 central galaxies at galactic latitude @xmath2030@xmath24 , he found 82 such companions with a visual absolute magnitude estimated to be brighter than 15.3 .",
    "this corresponds approximately to our smc - like limit , and within this radius we find only 11 star - forming satellites , at least an order of magnitude fewer than the total satellite numbers inferred by @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite find 1 satellite brighter than m@xmath25=16.5 ( corresponding to a luminosity of 6.2@xmath710@xmath9  l@xmath5 , somewhat brighter than the smc ) per central galaxy .",
    "we find only 15 satellites this bright in our sample , or 29 after correction for volume incompleteness , still only 1 star - forming satellite per 5 central galaxies searched .",
    "our low numbers compared with both @xcite and @xcite may imply efficient truncation of sf in satellites , such that the majority of satellites become red , quiescent systems well before they merge with their central galaxies , or there may be some remaining inclusion of line - of - sight projected companions in the earlier studies .",
    "it is also of interest to compare with @xcite , who searched 45 central galaxies of types sb - sc , with absolute magnitudes m@xmath25 19.5 to 20.5 .",
    "they found 69 satellites , with a distribution of relative luminosities that is generally consistent with that of the present sample ( see section  [ sec : res ] ) , and concluded that close - in satellites have marginally smaller sizes than those at large galactocentric distance .",
    "there is some evidence for a similar effect in fig .",
    "[ fig : sepmagdiff ] , in the sense that the faintest satellites seem to be preferentially close - in , with the upper right - hand corner of the plot being underpopulated .",
    "many satellite studies have made use of the sdss , exploiting the huge numbers of galaxies and the immense statistical weight this provides .",
    "however , it should be noted that the sdss studies explore an almost completely distinct part of parameter space from the present work , in particular with regard to the luminosity of satellites found .",
    "for example , @xcite studied a sample of 2254 central galaxies from sdss data release 5 , with mean luminosities close to @xmath26 and thus very comparable to the present sample .",
    "they found 4986 companions associated with these galaxies , and studied the effects of central galaxy type and proximity on the properties ( early- vs. late - type ) of the companions .",
    "however , it is important to note that these companions have a median luminosity difference of only 1.8 mag relative to their central galaxies .",
    "our study finds much fainter satellite galaxies , with almost half being less than 1% of the luminosity of their central galaxy .",
    "we now turn to a comparison with theoretical studies , and in particular with the recent predictions from @xmath2cdm models .",
    "the main point to make here is that the mw appears unusual in the possession of bright , star - forming satellites , and thus the prediction of such satellites @xcite should not be taken as validation of models .",
    "thus the modifications to models suggested by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to produce the full range of mw satellites including the mc are not required in order to explain the satellite properties of the ensemble of bright disk galaxies studied here .",
    "more positively , the finding of @xcite ( reproduced in the ` baseline ' versions of many subsequent simulations ) , that fewer than 5% of disk galaxies have satellites resembling the lmc , is consistent with our results .",
    "this scarcity of satellites found here argues against such systems as a dominant source of gas supply at the current epoch .",
    "most central galaxies have no gas - rich satellites within the volumes surveyed here .",
    "if such satellites are present but typically outside the surveyed volume , this would put them at galactocentric distances greater than @xmath3200  kpc .",
    "the typical dynamical friction timescales would then be at least several gyr @xcite , clearly too long for substantial gas supply for a large spiral , which requires the gas content of a magellanic - type satellite every gyr or so .",
    "fainter satellites have even longer dynamical timescales and so seem unlikely to provide a significant contribution to the gas supply , even if there is a strong upturn in numbers faintward of our detection limits .",
    "we repeat the major caveat on the present work , which is that this technique is completely insensitive to gas - poor red - sequence satellites . a survey of satellite galaxies of all types ( m. prescott et al . in preparation ) is currently being prepared from the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) project @xcite , using the aaomega spectrometer on the anglo - australian telescope , and will provide a useful complementary view of satellite populations .",
    "this work has provided a number of satellites which can be used to compare the detailed properties of the lmc and smc , with several examples of analogues for each . the one aspect of the clouds for which there is no clear analogue is their binary nature , with all of the possible satellite pairs being either significantly more widely separated than the mc , or very close to the central galaxy .",
    "this is an interesting discovery in itself , but is also somewhat disappointing , as there are important questions on the role of binarity in forming the magellanic stream , which could have been clarified by observing more such examples .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "magellanic - type satellite galaxies are rare ; for the majority ( approximately two - thirds ) of the central galaxies searched , no star - forming satellites at all have been found . among those sf satellites that are found ,",
    "the mc are significantly brighter than the average , closer to their central galaxy than most , and are also unusual in that they form a close pair .",
    "we caution against using the mw and its immediate environment as a model for simulations of galaxy formation , particularly as regards bright satellites .",
    "however , some recent models that are not tuned to produce mc - like satellites do accurately predict the bright satellite fractions found in the present study .",
    "our results also highlight substantial problems with gas - rich satellites as the major source of gas supply to maintain sf in disk galaxies .",
    "the major caveat on this work is that it applies to star - forming satellites only , so studies of the red satellite fraction , e.g. from the gama survey , are essential to provide a full picture of the satellite population .",
    "the next paper in this series will provide a full catalogue of satellite properties , including the 62 discussed here , resulting from a larger and more eclectic sample of h@xmath0 imaging , including @xmath1-band and h@xmath0 luminosity functions , stellar masses , sf rates , and the effects of central galaxy proximity on sf properties .",
