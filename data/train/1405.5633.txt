    "<S> the geiger - nuttall ( gn ) law relates the partial @xmath0-decay half - life with the energy of the escaping @xmath0 particle and contains for every isotopic chain two experimentally determined coefficients . </S>",

    "<S> the gn law has been verified in long isotopic chains and no strong deviations have been observed : it is extremely successful and is considered to be generally valid . recently </S>",
    "<S> the amount of @xmath0 decay data in heavy and superheavy nuclei has greatly increased @xcite and the gn law is still fulfilled , reproducing most experimental data within a factor 2@xmath83 , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ gn]a for the yb - ra region ( apart from the po chain , as will be discussed in this paper ) . </S>",

    "<S> the greatest challenge was thus to understand how the @xmath0 particle could leave the mother nucleus without any external agent disturbing it . </S>",
    "<S> the first successful theoretical explanation was given by gamow @xcite and independently by condon and gurney @xcite , who explained @xmath0 decay as the penetration ( tunneling ) through the coulomb barrier , leading to the @xmath15 dependence of eq . </S>",

    "<S> this was a great revolution in physics and confirmed the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> besides its pioneering role in the development of quantum theory , the @xmath0 decay also broadens our understanding of the quantum tunneling process of other composite objects . </S>",

    "<S> the remaining challenge is to identify the microscopic basis of the gn coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thomas provided the first attempt of a microscopic theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> his expression for the half life considered the probability that the four nucleons , which eventually constitute the @xmath0 particle , get clustered at a certain distance on the nuclear surface . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will apply thomas s expression to probe the general validity of the gn law , explain the @xmath24 dependence of the constants and their microscopic origin .    </S>",
    "<S> guided by recent experimental findings , we divide the @xmath0-decaying nuclei into four regions ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ abngt126 ] shows that both coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 are linearly dependent upon @xmath24 for regions i and iii , however with different coefficients . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite and attributed to the crossing of the @xmath11 neutron shell . </S>",
    "<S> the recent extension of the available data also shows that , when crossing the @xmath26 shell gap ( from region i to region ii ) , another set of coefficients , strongly deviating from the values in region i and iii , is needed . </S>",
    "<S> further , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b , recent @xmath0-decay experiments at ship in gsi ( darmstadt , germany ) to study the neutron - deficient po isotopes @xcite show a significant and gradually increasing deviation from the gn law using the coefficients as reported in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . in @xmath1po , </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the experimental half - life and that predicted by the gn law is as large as one order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> such a strong deviation has not been seen before .    in order to understand the three issues mentioned above we go through the derivations of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where a generalization of the gn law was found . </S>",
    "<S> this generalization holds for all isotopic chains and all cluster radioactivities . according to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the @xmath0-decay half - life can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the velocity of the emitted @xmath0 particle which carries an angular momentum @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> as only ground - state to ground - state @xmath0 decays of even - even nuclei are considered here , @xmath29 is equal to 0 in all cases . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 is a distance around the nuclear surface where the wave function describing the cluster in the mother nucleus is matched with the outgoing cluster+daughter wave function . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31 is the coulomb - hankel function with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the coulomb parameter , where @xmath34 is the reduced mass and @xmath24 is the charge number of the daughter nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath35 is the formation amplitude of the @xmath0 cluster at distance @xmath30 . introducing the quantities @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 , one gets , after imposing the condition of the half life being independent on @xmath30 @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constant parameters which only depend upon local variations of the formation probability . </S>",
    "<S> they are determined by fitting experimental data @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason why these parameters are practically constant is that , when going from one isotope to another , the @xmath0-particle formation probability usually varies much less than the penetrability . </S>",
    "<S> on the logarithm scale of the gn law the differences in the formation probabilities are usually small fluctuations along the straight lines predicted by that law . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the constancy of the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a consequence of the smooth variation in the nuclear structure that is often found when going from a nucleus to its neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the reason why , for example , the bcs approximation works so well in many regions of nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) calculated values of @xmath43 for observed even - even @xmath0 emitters as a function of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the linear fit to the values is shown by the solid line . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath44 takes into account the tunneling through the coulomb barrier , while @xmath45 , which does not depend upon @xmath4 , includes effects induced by the clusterization in the mother nucleus @xcite . by comparing equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , </S>",
    "<S> a correspondence between the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the expressions @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively can be deduced and the meaning of the coefficients can be unfolded . </S>",
    "<S> the observed linear dependency of @xmath6 upon @xmath24 is substantiated by this representation . </S>",
    "<S> the observed negative values for @xmath7 are understood as both terms @xmath41 and @xmath42 are negative @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the linear dependence upon @xmath24 of @xmath7 seems to be in conflict with the @xmath46 dependence of the term @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> however for nuclei with known @xmath0-decay half - lives for which the gn law has so far been applied , @xmath43 is practically a linear function of @xmath24 , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ abz3 ] .     a pictorial representation of the generic form of the evolution of the @xmath0 formation probabilities @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> thick solid lines are for isotopes , where experimental data are available and dashed lines are extapolations to the regions with the yet unavailable data . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data as cited in @xcite are shown by points , connected by thin lines , to guide the eye . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the need for a different linear @xmath24 dependence of the coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the four regions of the nuclear chart ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) will now be addressed . </S>",
    "<S> a generic form for the evolution of the alpha formation probabilities was proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was based on experimental values @xcite and calculations performed within the framework of the seniority scheme . </S>",
    "<S> this generic form is shown in fig . 4 for selected isotopic chains . </S>",
    "<S> three distinct features can be extracted from this schematic representation .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental @xmath0 formation probabilities of most known @xmath0 emitters in regions i and iii are nearly constant as a function of neutron number ( or more exactly , weakly linearly dependent on @xmath43 , as seen in fig . 1 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . for those nuclei </S>",
    "<S> , the gn law is indeed expected to be valid and @xmath6 and @xmath7 follow a linear behavior as a function of @xmath24 ( see figs . 1 & 3 and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 for po ( circle ) and rn ( triangle ) isotopes in region ii with @xmath12 ( closed symbols ) and region iii with @xmath21 ( open symbols ) as a function of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines are to guide the eye . ]    approaching the @xmath49 shell closure with increasing neutron number , a strong , exponential decrease of the formation probability is observed ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , in region ii and the discussion in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is striking that in spite of a variation of @xmath50 over one order of magnitude , the gn law and the @xmath6 and @xmath7 linear dependence upon @xmath24 are still valid . </S>",
    "<S> this has no real physical meaning , but is a consequence of the specific dependence of the @xmath50 on @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 ( as well as @xmath15 ) values exhibit a quasi linear pattern as a function of rising neutron number when approaching the @xmath11 shell closure . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath48 and thus @xmath51 will still depend linearly on @xmath15 . as examples , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fvsq ] the logs of the @xmath0 formation probabilities @xmath47 for polonium and radon isotopes in regions ii & iii are shown as a function of @xmath15 . in comparison with those in region </S>",
    "<S> iii for which the formation probabilities are nearly constant or only weakly depend on @xmath15 , the data in region ii show an exponential dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the other isotopic chains in region ii show a similar linearly decreasing behavior of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath15 , as indicated by the red - dashed lines in the figure , however with different slopes . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the gn law remains valid for isotopic chains in region ii , but the corresponding values of @xmath9 and @xmath52 will increase with @xmath24 beyond the trend observed in region i and iii ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) .    for the polonium isotopic chain with @xmath12 , the linear behavior of @xmath48 breaks down below @xmath53po ( @xmath54 , corresponding to @xmath55 in fig . 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the gn law is broken in the light polonium isotopes of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ gn]b . </S>",
    "<S> this violation of the gn law , observed here for the first time , is induced by the strong suppression of the @xmath0 formation probability due to the fact that the deformations and configurations of the ground states of the lightest @xmath0-decaying neutron - deficient polonium isotopes ( @xmath56 ) are very different from those of the daughter lead isotopes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned that our generic form on the evolution of @xmath57 presented here and in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is mainly guided by available experimental data . a systematic microscopic calculation on @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> is desired to confirm this conjecture .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the origin and physical meaning of the coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the gn law . </S>",
    "<S> these coefficients are determined from experimental data and show a linear dependence upon @xmath24 . however , the @xmath24-dependence is different in different regions of the nuclear chart . starting from the microscopic thomas expression for the decay half life </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath6 models the tunneling process as well as the relatively small variations in the structure of the neighboring nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath7 takes into account the clusterization of the @xmath0-particle in the mother nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we show why the coefficient @xmath7 is negative and that both @xmath6 and @xmath7 have to be practically linearly dependent upon @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrated here for the first time that , when the dependence of @xmath48 on the neutron number is not linear or constant , the gn law is broken . </S>",
    "<S> this also explains why the gn law works so well in all @xmath0 emitters known today except for the polonium isotopes , as the data within each isotopic chain are so far limited to a region where @xmath48 behaves linearly with @xmath58 or is constant . </S>",
    "<S> it is only for the polonium isotopic chain that experimental data have been obtained over a wide enough range to observe significant deviations from the gn law . within the generic description @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the different values of the alpha formation probability for regions i and iii and the exponential decrease as a function of neutron number when approaching @xmath11 for region ii , can be understood as due to the available @xmath59 orbitals and a difference in the clustering properties of the nucleons in the @xmath0 particle . </S>",
    "<S> clustering of the two protons and two neutrons leading to the @xmath0-particle formation proceeds through high - lying empty single particle configurations . </S>",
    "<S> it would therefore be very interesting to extend the experimental knowledge towards more neutron deficient radon , radium and thorium isotopes in region ii and to more neutron - rich lead and mercury isotopes in region i & iv . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow us to validate the generic description , identify the saturation levels of the @xmath0 formation probability and to investigate the influence of protons and neutrons filling the same single particle orbitals ( between 82 and 126 ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , compared to the use of the so far generally accepted gn description , more reliable predictions of the @xmath0 decay half lives will be achieved in unknown nuclei and in low @xmath0-decay branching ratios close to stability . </S>"
