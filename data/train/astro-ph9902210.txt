    "there are compelling reasons to believe that the dark matter of the universe is constituted , at least in part , by non - baryonic collisionless particles with low primordial velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "such particles are called cold dark matter .",
    "the leading candidates are axions and weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) . before the onset of galaxy formation but after the time @xmath2 of equality between matter and radiation , the velocity dispersion of the cold dark matter candidates is very small , of order @xmath3 for axions and @xmath4 for wimps , where @xmath5 is the present age of the universe and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the masses of the axion and the wimp .",
    "the above estimates of the primordial velocity dispersions , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are very crude but our point is only that in the context of this paper , and of galaxy formation in general , @xmath8 and @xmath10 are entirely negligible .",
    "massive neutrinos , on the other hand , have primordial velocity dispersion @xmath11 which is comparable to the virial velocity in galaxies and is therefore non - negligible in the context of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "for this reason , massive neutrinos are called `` hot dark matter '' .    before the onset of galaxy formation , the collisionless dark matter particles lie on a thin 3-dimensional ( 3d ) sheet in 6d phase - space .",
    "the thickness of this sheet is the primordial velocity dispersion @xmath12 . if each of the aforementioned species of collisionless particles is present , the phase - space sheet has three layers , a very thin layer of axions , a medium layer of wimps and a thick layer of neutrinos .",
    "the phase - space sheet is located on the 3d hypersurface of points @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath15 is the peculiar velocity field .",
    "1 shows a 2d section of 6d phase - space along the @xmath16 plane .",
    "the wiggly line is the intersection of the 3d sheet on which the particles lie in phase - space with the plane of the figure .",
    "the thickness of the line is the velocity dispersion @xmath12 , whereas the amplitude of the wiggles in the line is the peculiar velocity @xmath17 .",
    "if there were no peculiar velocities , the line would be straight since @xmath18 in that case .",
    "the peculiar velocities are associated with density perturbations and grow by gravitational instability as @xmath19 . on the other hand the primordial velocity dispersion decreases on average as @xmath20 , consistently with liouville s theorem .",
    "when a large overdensity enters the non - linear regime , the particles in the vicinity of the overdensity fall back onto it .",
    "this implies that the phase - space sheet `` winds up '' in clockwise fashion wherever an overdensity grows in the non - linear regime .",
    "one such overdensity is shown in fig .",
    "1 . before density perturbations enter the non - linear regime ,",
    "there is only one value of velocity , i.e. one single flow , at a typical location in physical space , because the phase - space sheet covers physical space only once . on the other hand , inside an overdensity in the non - linear regime ,",
    "the phase - space sheet covers physical space multiple times implying that there are several , but always an odd number of , flows at such locations in physical space .    at the boundary between two regions one of which",
    "has @xmath21 flows and the other @xmath22 flows , the physical space density is very large because the phase - space sheet has a fold there . at the fold ,",
    "the phase - space sheet is tangent to velocity space and hence , in the limit of zero velocity dispersion @xmath23 , the density diverges since it is the integral of the phase - space density over velocity space .",
    "the structure associated with such a phase - space fold is called a caustic. it is easy to show ( see section ii ) that , in the limit of zero velocity dispersion , the density diverges as @xmath24 when the caustic is approached from the side with @xmath25 flows , where @xmath26 is the distance to the caustic . if the velocity dispersion is small but non - zero , the divergence is cut off so that the density is no longer infinite at the caustic but merely very large .    in discussing this type of phenomenon , it is useful to adopt a parametrization of the phase - space sheet in the limit of zero velocity dispersion , by giving each particle a 3-parameter label @xmath27 .",
    "the phase - space sheet location at time @xmath28 is specified by the map @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the position in physical space of particle @xmath31 at time @xmath28 .",
    "the velocity of particle @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "the density diverges wherever the map @xmath33 is singular , i.e. where the jacobian @xmath34 vanishes .",
    "thus caustics are associated with zeros of @xmath35 . since @xmath36 is one condition on three parameters , caustics are generically two dimensional surfaces .",
    "y. zeldovich @xcite emphasized the importance of caustics in large scale structure formation , suggesting the name `` pancakes '' for them .",
    "the reason why galaxies tend to lie on surfaces @xcite , such as `` the great wall '' , is undoubtedly that the 3d sheet on which the dark matter particles and baryons lie in phase - space acquires folds on very large scales , producing caustics appropriately called `` zeldovich pancakes '' .",
    "s. tremaine @xcite recently used the techniques of catastrophe theory @xcite to catalogue the caustics which may occur in observations of structure formation .",
    "we saw above that where a localized overdensity is growing in the non - linear regime , the line which is at the intersection of the phase - space sheet with the @xmath16 plane winds up in clockwise fashion . the onset of this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "of course , the picture is qualitatively the same in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 planes . in this view , the process of galactic halo formation is the winding up of the phase - space sheet of collisionless dark matter particles .",
    "when the galactic center is approached from any direction , the local number of flows increases .",
    "first , there is one flow , then three flows , then five , seven ... the number of flows at our location in the milky way galaxy has been estimated to be of order 100 @xcite .",
    "the boundary between the region with one ( three , five , ... ) and the region with three ( five , seven , ... ) flows is the location of a caustic which is topologically a sphere surrounding the galaxy .",
    "when these caustic spheres are approached from the inside the density diverges as @xmath39 in the zero velocity dispersion limit .",
    "i call these spheres `` outer '' caustics to distinguish them from the `` inner '' caustics which are the main topic of this paper .    to see inner caustics , let us first discuss the case where the overdensity is spherically symmetric and all the dark matter particles carry zero angular momentum with respect to the center .",
    "all particles move on radial orbits then . as a result",
    "the galactic center is a caustic point where the density associated with each flow in and out of the galaxy diverges as @xmath40 in the limit of zero velocity dispersion , where @xmath41 is the radial coordinate .",
    "we remarked earlier that a caustic is generically a surface .",
    "thus we find a caustic _ point _ only because we are assuming spherical symmetry and purely radial orbits .",
    "if these assumptions are relaxed , the caustic at the galactic center will spread over some size @xmath42 .",
    "the notion of caustic point is nonetheless useful provided @xmath42 is small enough .",
    "indeed , for @xmath43 the density will still behave as @xmath40 and the phase - space structure will be qualitatively the same as for @xmath44 .",
    "the question arises what is the inner caustic in the absence of spherical symmetry and in the presence of angular momentum .",
    "i. tkachev , y. wang and i found @xcite that the inner caustic is a ring , i.e. a closed line .",
    "the density diverges as @xmath45 in the zero velocity dispersion limit where @xmath26 is the distance to the line @xcite . however , as remarked earlier , a caustic is generically a surface .",
    "so a caustic line must again be a special degenerate case .",
    "indeed , we will see below that a caustic ring is more precisely a closed tube with a special structure . nonetheless , when the transverse dimensions , called @xmath46 and @xmath47 below , are small compared to the radius of curvature @xmath42 of the tube , @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "hence , it makes sense to think of the caustic ring first as a closed line and then , on closer inspection , as a closed tube .",
    "the next question is what is the structure of the tube .",
    "we find below that its transverse cross - section is a closed line with three cusps , one of which points away from the galactic center ( see figs . 5 and 6 ) . in the language of catastrophe theory such a singularity",
    "is called a @xmath0 catastrophe @xcite .",
    "it has a triality ( i.e. a @xmath1 invariance ) which is reminiscent of the triality of the lie group @xmath50 , also called so(8 ) .",
    "the existence of caustic rings of dark matter results from only two assumptions ( see section iii for a derivation ) :    1 .   the existence of collisionless dark matter 2 .   that the velocity dispersion of the infalling dark matter is much less , by a factor ten say , than the rotation velocity of the galaxy .",
    "only the second assumption requires elaboration .",
    "we noted earlier that velocity dispersion smoothes out caustics .",
    "the question is when is the velocity dispersion so large as to smooth caustic rings over distance scales of order the ring radius @xmath42 , thus making the notion of caustic ring meaningless . in ref .",
    "@xcite this critical velocity dispersion was estimated to be 30 km / s = @xmath51 for the caustic rings in our own galaxy , whose rotation velocity is 220 km / s .",
    "@xmath51 is much less than the _ primordial _ velocity dispersion @xmath12 of the cold dark matter candidates .",
    "however the velocity dispersion @xmath17 associated with density perturbations also smoothes caustics in coarse grained observations . from the point of view of an observer with infinite resolution",
    ", the effect of @xmath17 on a caustic surface is to make it bumpy .",
    "however , to an observer with poor spatial resolution , this is the same as smoothing the surface .",
    "so the question is whether the velocity dispersion @xmath17 of cold dark matter particles associated with density perturbations falling onto our galaxy is less than 30 km / s .",
    "the answer is yes with very high probability since the infalling dark matter particles are not associated with any observed inhomogeneities , and the velocity dispersion of an inhomogeneity as large as the large magellanic cloud is still only 10 km / s . the only way the velocity dispersion of the infalling dark matter particles could be as large as say 20 km / s is for these particles to be part of clumps whose mass / size ratio is 4 times larger than that of the large magellanic cloud .",
    "but if that were the case , why did these clumps fail to become luminous ?",
    "i have interpreted @xcite the appearance of bumps in the rotation curves of ngc3198 and of our own galaxy as due to caustic rings of dark matter .",
    "that interpretation makes use of an additional assumption , namely that the infall of dark matter particles is self - similar @xcite .",
    "this additional assumption is not used in this paper .",
    "the goal is to clearly distinguish those conclusions which follow exclusively from the two assumptions listed above from those conclusions which require the extra assumption of self - similarity .",
    "we are however motivated by the possiblility that caustic rings may be observed as bumps in rotation curves and we derive the shape that such a bump should ideally have .",
    "gravitational lensing by caustic rings @xcite is another technique by which these structures may be observed",
    ".    one might ask whether caustic rings can be seen in n - body simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "zeldovich pancakes are seen @xcite .",
    "however , caustic rings would require far greater resolution than presently available , at least in a 3d simulation of our own halo .",
    "indeed , the largest ring in our galaxy has been estimated to have radius of order 40 kpc @xcite .",
    "it occurs in a flow that extends to the galaxy s current turnaround radius , of order 2 mpc . to resolve this first ring ,",
    "the spatial resolution would have to be of order 10 kpc or smaller .",
    "hence a minimum of @xmath52 particles would be required to see the caustic ring in a simulation of this one flow . however , the number of flows at 40 kpc in our halo is of order 10 @xcite .",
    "so it appears that several times @xmath53 particles are necessary in a 3d simulation of our halo .",
    "this is a strict minimum because it only addresses the kinematic requirement of resolving the halo in phase - space , assuming moreover that the particles are approximately uniformly distributed on the phase - space sheets .",
    "there is a further dynamical requirement that 2-body collisions do not artificially fuzz up the phase - space sheets .",
    "indeed 2-body collisions are entirely negligible in the flow of cold dark matter particles such as axions or wimps . as a result , liouville s theorem is strictly obeyed . on the other hand ,",
    "2-body collisions are present in n - body simulations and thus liouville s theorem is violated . as a result the velocity dispersion is artificially increased in the simulations .",
    "this may occur to such an extent that the caustics are washed away even if several @xmath53 particles are used .",
    "the best bet to see a caustic ring would obviously be in a 2d simulation of an axially symmetric flow .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a general discussion of caustic surfaces and caustic lines .",
    "caustic lines are a degenerate case whereas caustic surfaces are generic .",
    "we distinguish two types of caustic line which we call _ attached _ and _ isolated_. the former are attached to caustic surfaces whereas the latter are not .",
    "caustic rings are of the _ isolated _ type . in section iii , we discuss the caustics associated with the infall of collisionless dark matter particles onto a galaxy .",
    "we focus most of our attention on the inner caustic rings .",
    "we show that the presence of these rings follows only from the two assumptions listed above .",
    "we find that the ring is a tube . inside the tube",
    "are four flows whereas outside the tube are two flows .",
    "( in addition there is an odd number of flows which are not associated with the caustic ring . ) in section iv , we give a detailed analysis of the caustic ring under the additional assumptions that the flow is axially and reflection symmetric and that the transverse dimensions of the ring , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , are small compared to the ring radius @xmath42 . in section iva , we show that under these assumptions the flow near the ring is described in terms of five parameters : @xmath42 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in section ivb",
    ", we relate these parameters to the velocity distribution of the infalling dark matter particles . in section ivc",
    ", we give a qualitative description of the flow of particles on distance scales of order the ring radius @xmath42 . in section",
    "v , the results of section iv are used to derive the shape of the bump a caustic ring causes in a galactic rotation curve if the ring lies in the galactic plane and the rotation curve is measured in the galactic plane .",
    "section vi summarizes the conclusions .",
    "consider a flow of collisionless particles with zero ( or negligible ) velocity dispersion .",
    "being collisionless , the particles obey liouville s theorem .",
    "since they have negligible velocity dispersion , the particles lie on a time - dependent 3d sheet in 6d phase - space .",
    "the flow is completely specified by giving the spatial coordinates @xmath58 of the particle labeled @xmath59 at time @xmath28 , for all @xmath60 and @xmath28 .",
    "the 3-parameter label @xmath60 is chosen arbitrarily .",
    "let @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , be the solutions of @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath21 is the number of distinct flows at @xmath64 and @xmath28 .",
    "the total number of particles is : @xmath65 the density of particles in physical space is thus : @xmath66 where @xmath67 the formula for the density is , of course , reparametrization invariant .",
    "caustics occur wherever @xmath36 , i.e. where the map @xmath68 is singular . at",
    "the caustic the density diverges .",
    "the divergence is cut off if the velocity dispersion is finite .",
    "generically the zeros of @xmath35 are simple , i.e. the matrix @xmath69 has a single vanishing eigenvalue . the condition that one eigenvalue vanishes imposes one constraint on the three parameters @xmath31 .",
    "hence a caustic is generically a 2d surface in physical space .",
    "consider a generic surface caustic at a fixed time @xmath28 .",
    "we may reparametrize the flow near the caustic , @xmath70 , such that the caustic surface is at @xmath71 .",
    "also , in a neighborhood of a point on the surface , choose cartesian coordinates such that @xmath72 is perpendicular to the surface whereas @xmath73 and @xmath74 are parallel .",
    "we have then : @xmath75 near that point .",
    "the 2-dim .",
    "matrix @xmath76 is non - singular . since @xmath36 at @xmath77",
    ", we have @xmath78 for small @xmath79 .",
    "we may orient the @xmath72-axis in such a way that @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath81 hence , near a caustic surface located at @xmath82 , the density diverges as @xmath83 on one side of the surface .",
    "2a shows a 2d cut of phase - space along the @xmath16 plane .",
    "the particles lie on a line which is at the intersection of the phase - space sheet with the @xmath16 plane .",
    "the label @xmath79 gives the position of the particles along the line .",
    "in the example of the figure , there are two caustic surfaces , one at @xmath84 and the other at @xmath85 .",
    "the two dimensions ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) into which the caustic extends as a surface are not shown . the density @xmath88 , shown in fig .",
    "2b , diverges as @xmath89 for @xmath90 with @xmath91 and as @xmath92 for @xmath93 with @xmath94 . for @xmath95 there are three flows",
    "( @xmath96 ) whereas for @xmath97 and @xmath98 there is only one flow ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the phase - space sheet `` folds back '' at @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "that is why the map @xmath102 is singular at these locations .",
    "next , consider places where @xmath35 has a double zero , i.e. where @xmath103 has vanishing eigenvalues for two different eigenvectors .",
    "the condition that two eigenvalues vanish defines a line .",
    "this line is the location of a more singular kind of caustic which we call line caustic.    in a small neighborhood of a line caustic let us reparametrize the flow @xmath104 such that @xmath105 defines the line in the new coordinates . also , choose cartesian coordinates such that @xmath72 is parallel to the line and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are perpendicular to it",

    "we call a im@xmath128 line caustic `` isolated '' because it is not attached to any surface caustic",
    ". ring caustics associated with the infall of collisionless dark matter onto a galaxy are line caustics of the isolated type .",
    "they will be discussed in detail in sections iii and iv .    if im@xmath127 , then @xmath139 and @xmath140 are real . from eq .",
    "( 2.11 ) and eq . ( 2.14 ) we see that @xmath35 has simple zeros along two surfaces , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and a double zero on the line where these two surfaces meet .",
    "thus the im@xmath127 line caustic is `` attached '' to two generic surface caustics .",
    "the following is an illustrative example : @xmath143 in this case @xmath144 , and hence the density @xmath145 for @xmath146 .",
    "we have no use for the `` attached '' type of line caustic in this paper .",
    "in this section we give a general discussion of the caustic rings that are associated with the infall of collisionless dark matter onto a galaxy . no symmetry is assumed .",
    "we do assume that the velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles is small compared to the rotation velocity of the galaxy .",
    "we set the velocity dispersion equal to zero and derive the existence of caustics .",
    "a small velocity dispersion provides a cutoff , so that the density at the caustic does not become infinite but merely very large .",
    "3 shows successive time frames of a set of collisionless particles falling through a galaxy .",
    "the particles move purely under the effect of gravity . in figure 3a ,",
    "the particles are at first turnaround , i.e. they are about to fall onto the galaxy for the first time in their history . they are located on a closed 2d surface surrounding the galaxy in physical space , called the `` turnaround sphere '' . fig .",
    "3 shows the intersection of this sphere with the plane of the figure , as it evolves in time . for the sake of definiteness",
    "it is assumed that the particles carry net angular momentum about the vertical axis .",
    "qualitatively speaking , the turnaround sphere is spinning about the vertical .",
    "the particles near the top ( bottom ) of the sphere in frame a carry little angular momentum and end up near the bottom ( top ) of the sphere in frame f after falling through the galaxy .",
    "the particles near the equator carry the most angular momentum .",
    "they form a ring whose radius decreases in time down to some minimum value , reached near frame d , and then increases again . generally the radius of the sphere at second turnaround is smaller than at first turnaround because the galaxy has grown by infall in the meantime . after second turnaround",
    "the sphere falls back in and repeats the same qualitative sequence till third turnaround , and so on .",
    "there is a generic surface caustic associated with the @xmath147th turnaround where @xmath148 .",
    "these caustics are located near where the particles of a given outflow reach their maximum radius before falling back in . to see this , parametrize the flow at a given time @xmath28 by @xmath149 where @xmath5 is the time the particle was at last turnaround and @xmath150  for example , spherical coordinates ",
    "tell us where the particle was on the turnaround sphere at that time .",
    "we define : @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 . in terms of these : @xmath154 since the discussion is for a fixed time @xmath28 , let us not show the @xmath28 dependence explicitly further .",
    "let us assume that @xmath155 is near particles at their @xmath147th turnaround with @xmath156 the spheres @xmath157 with @xmath158 considerably larger or considerably smaller than @xmath5 are inside the sphere @xmath159 .",
    "this implies that for all @xmath150 there is a @xmath160 such that @xmath161 is parallel to the sphere @xmath162 , and hence where @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the sphere @xmath163 is the location of a generic surface caustic .",
    "these _ outer _",
    "caustics were mentioned in the introduction as the boundaries between the regions with @xmath21 flows and those with @xmath25 flows where @xmath164 we do not discuss them further in this paper .",
    "our focus is upon the _ inner _ caustics which , as we will soon see , have the shape of rings ( closed tubes ) and which are located near where the particles with the most angular momentum in a given inflow reach their distance of closest approach to the galactic center before moving back out of the galaxy .    to see inner caustic rings , let us return to the sphere of fig .",
    "3 . during each infall - outfall sequence ,",
    "the sphere turns itself inside out .",
    "indeed , a particle which is part of the flow and is just inside the sphere in frame b of fig .",
    "3 is outside the sphere in frame e , and vice - versa .",
    "there is therefore a ring of points in space - time which are inside the sphere last .",
    "the intersection of this space - time ring with the plane of the figure is at two space - time points , one located at the cusp in frame d , the other at the cusp in frame e. since there is a continuous flow of spheres falling in and out , the ring just defined is a persistent feature in space .",
    "we now show that it is the location of a caustic .",
    "4 shows the infall sphere in a neighborhood of space and time where it is completing the process of turning itself inside out .",
    "we choose cartesian coordinates such that @xmath74 is parallel to the ring at that point ; @xmath73 and @xmath72 are as shown .",
    "we parametrize the flow in a small neighborhood of the ring by @xmath165 such that @xmath166 . as before , @xmath5 labels successive infall spheres and may be taken to be the time of their last turnaround .",
    "thus : @xmath167 fig .",
    "4a shows an infall sphere just before it reaches the ring .",
    "the line is the intersection of the infall sphere with the plane of the figure .",
    "@xmath168 labels points along the line .",
    "we have @xmath169 at points a and b because the line is parallel to the @xmath73-axis at these points . similarly , @xmath170 at point c. fig .",
    "4b shows an infall sphere at the moment it reaches the ring .",
    "points a , b and c in fig .",
    "4a have moved to point e in fig .",
    "4b . hence @xmath171 and therefore @xmath36 at point e , which is thus the location of a caustic .    in general , @xmath35 only has a simple zero at e , which means that e is the location of a _ surface _",
    "we show below that the complete inner caustic surface is a closed tube .",
    "e is a point on this tube . in the limit where the transverse size @xmath46 of",
    "the tube goes to zero , both @xmath171 and @xmath172 at e. @xmath35 then has a double zero at e. in that limit the tube caustic becomes an _ isolated _ line caustic where the density diverges as @xmath173 .",
    "when @xmath46 is finite but small , the density @xmath174 for @xmath175 but has a more complicated behaviour for @xmath176 .",
    "let us show that the inner caustic must have the topology of a tube , starting with the case of fig . 3 and generalizing from there . in fig",
    "3b , @xmath177 ( not shown explicitly ) is everywhere pointing outward of the infall sphere because later infall spheres are outside this one . in fig .",
    "3f , @xmath177 is pointing inside because later infall spheres are inside this one .",
    "this implies that during the infall @xmath178 either vanishes at some space - time points or becomes parallel to the sphere . since @xmath36 at such points",
    ", they are the location of caustics . since @xmath35 is a continuous function of @xmath31 , the caustic must lie on a closed surface .",
    "now , if we follow the motion of points which are near the top ( bottom ) of the sphere in fig . 3b and end up near the bottom ( top ) in fig .",
    "3e , @xmath177 always points up ( down ) .",
    "@xmath177 does not vanish and is not parallel to the sphere at any time between these two frames for these points .",
    "this implies that there are no inner caustics within some cylinder extending from top to bottom in the spatial volume under consideration in fig .",
    "3 . on the other hand , for the points near the equator in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath177 is pointing outward during infall and is pointing inward during outfall . thus if we track a point near the equator , at some time @xmath177 either vanishes or is parallel to the sphere . the points where this happens lie on a closed surface which is outside the previously defined cylinder but wraps around it . that surface must therefore be a tube .",

    "8 should be added to a descending rotation curve so that the total rotation curve , with the effect of the caustic ring included , remains flat on average .",
    "10 gives a qualitative description .",
    "we discussed the appearance of caustics in the flow of collisionless particles with negligible velocity dispersion .",
    "caustics are locations in physical space where the density diverges in the limit of zero velocity dispersion .",
    "this happens wherever the 3d sheet on which the particles lie in 6d phase - space folds back .",
    "the generic caustic is a surface at the boundary between two regions in physical space , one of which has @xmath21 flows and the other @xmath25 flows .",
    "the density diverges as @xmath442 , where @xmath26 is the distance to the surface , on the side with @xmath25 flows .",
    "we discussed line caustics as well .",
    "these are a degenerate case where the density diverges as @xmath443 where @xmath26 is the distance to the line .",
    "we divided line caustics into two types : `` attached '' ( @xmath444 ) and `` isolated '' ( @xmath445 ) . in the latter",
    "the density is finite everywhere except on the line , whereas in the former the line is at the intersection of two surface caustics .",
    "we discussed the fall of collisionless dark matter with negligible velocity dispersion in and out of a galaxy .",
    "two types of caustic form : outer caustics which are spherical surfaces surrounding the galaxy and inner caustics which are rings .",
    "the caustic rings are located near where the particles with the most angular momentum are at their closest approach to the galactic center .",
    "the surface of the ring is a closed tube whose cross - section is a closed line which has three cusps one of which points away from the galactic center .",
    "the tube is the location of a generic surface caustic . inside the tube",
    "there are four flows whereas outside there are two flows . in the limit where the transverse dimensions of the tube vanish",
    "the ring is a closed line caustic of the isolated variety .",
    "we analyzed the ring caustic in detail in the case of axial symmetry about the @xmath72-axis , of reflection symmetry @xmath446 , and where the transverse dimensions , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , of the tube are much smaller than the ring radius @xmath42 .",
    "the caustic is then described by 5 parameters : @xmath42 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath5 and @xmath54 .",
    "the precise shape of a transverse section of the ring in this limit is shown in fig .",
    "the 5 parameters were determined in terms of the initial velocity distribution of the infalling dark matter particles assuming the gravitational potential of the galaxy to be spherically symmetric .",
    "also , a qualitative description was given of the flow of dark matter particles on length scales of order @xmath42 .",
    "finally we discussed the gravitational effects of caustic rings , in particular the perturbation in a galactic rotation curve caused by a ring lying in the galactic plane .",
