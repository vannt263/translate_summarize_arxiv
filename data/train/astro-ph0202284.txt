    "one of the most important and challenging questions in astrophysics is the origin of strong and large - scale magnetic fields in galaxies and protogalaxies .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the strong cosmic magnetic fields were produced by the turbulent dynamo inductive action driven by the fluid motions in a galactic and/or protogalactic medium ( vainshtein & zeldovich 1972 ; zweibel & heiles 1997 ; kulsrud 2000 ) . yet",
    "full understanding of all stages of this production has not been achieved .",
    "there are two alternative theories on how and when the magnetic fields have been produced . the first theory , the galactic dynamo theory , also known as the @xmath0@xmath1 dynamo theory , states that the fields have been primarily amplified in differentially rotating galactic disks after the galaxies had been formed ( parker 1971 ; vainshtein & ruzmaikin 1972 ; beck 1996 ) .",
    "the galactic dynamo involves several crucial unsolved problems ( rosner & deluca 1989 ; zweibel & heiles 1997 , kulsrud 1999 ) .",
    "the main problem is that in the @xmath0@xmath1 theory it seems to be extremely difficult to expel a fraction of the magnetic flux from a galactic disk in order to produce the net magnetic flux ( rafikov & kulsrud 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , observations indicate the presence of microgauss magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and in early galaxies at high redshifts ( perry 1994 ; kronberg 1994 ) .",
    "it is hard to explain such strong fields by the galactic dynamo theory ( zweibel & heiles 1997 ) . in this paper",
    "we accept the second theory for the origin of cosmic magnetic fields , _ the primordial dynamo theory _ , which states that the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields have primarily been produced in protogalaxies , i.  e.  before the galaxies were formed ( pudritz & silk 1989 ; kulsrud & anderson 1992 ; kulsrud 1997 ; kulsrud 2000 ) .",
    "of course , these fields were subsequently modified in the rotating galactic disks after the galaxies were formed .    in order to understand how",
    "the magnetic fields can be built up in protogalaxies , let us briefly discuss the physical conditions that were present there  .",
    "let us assume the following typical values for the total mass @xmath2 of a protogalaxy , the total to baryon mass ratio @xmath3 , and the protogalaxy size @xmath4 : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "then , the number density of the gas in the protogalaxy is @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the proton mass , for convenience , in this paragraph we give the scaling of physical parameters with the three `` basic '' parameters @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 ) . assuming the energy virial equilibrium in the protogalaxy , we easily estimate the gas temperature , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the gravitational and the boltzmann constants ) .",
    "this temperature is very high , while the density is very low . as a result",
    ", the gas is fully ionized , and the viscosity is dominated by ions , not by neutrals .",
    "the ion collision time is @xmath13 ( in this formula the temperature is in degrees k , the density is in @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the coulomb logarithm assumed to be independent of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 , braginskii 1965 ) .",
    "the virial thermal speed is @xmath16 .",
    "the ion kinematic viscosity can be estimated as @xmath17 ( braginskii 1965 ) .",
    "the spitzer resistivity is @xmath18 ( in this formula the temperature is in degrees k , and the coulomb logarithm is assumed to be constant , @xmath15 , spitzer 1962 ) .",
    "now we estimate the reynolds and the prandtl numbers , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the minimal wave number in the protogalaxy ) and @xmath21 , they are very large . the viscous cutoff scale of the turbulence can be estimated as @xmath22 , the resistive cutoff scale for the magnetic field as @xmath23 , and the ion mean free path as @xmath24 .",
    "thus , there is a hierarchy of scales in the protogalaxy , @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , we can use the single - fluid magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations for the description of plasma , and can consider the plasma to be nonresistive and incompressible on scales @xmath26",
    ".   is extremely small in protogalaxies .",
    "also we can consider the plasma to be incompressible on scales @xmath27 because the plasma velocities at the largest scales , @xmath28 , are of the order of the sound speed , and all velocities at smaller scales are smaller .",
    "for estimation purposes , we can use the mhd equations even for scales @xmath29 , if we reduce the molecular viscosity by factor @xmath30 .",
    "[ comment_mhd_treatment ] ]    it is very important that in a protogalaxy the ion cyclotron period in the magnetic field , @xmath31 , is shorter than the ion collision time , @xmath32 , provided that the field strength is larger than @xmath33@xmath34 . on the other hand , the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the kinetic energy of the smallest turbulent eddies ( which are on the viscous cutoff scale ) if the field strength exceeds @xmath35 .",
    "thus , there is a very broad range of magnetic field strengths , at which the magnetic pressure and tension are still negligible , while the presence of the field is already important .",
    "this is because the plasma is strongly magnetized , @xmath36 , and the magnetic field controls the microscopic motions of ions , so that the viscous forces are given by the braginskii viscous stress [ braginskii 1965 ; see also eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) ] and are different from the viscous forces in a field - free plasma .",
    "we believe that there are five major stages of the production of the strong cosmic magnetic fields , see figure  [ figure_field_scales ] . during the first stage , in a protogalaxy undergoing gravitational collapse , the biermann battery builds a seed magnetic field linearly in time , on a time scale approximately equal to the free - fall time , @xmath37  billion years .",
    "the resulting seed field is of the order of @xmath38 on the viscous scale ( pudritz & silk 1989 ; kulsrud 1997 ; davies & widrow 2000 ) .    during the second stage ,",
    "when the plasma is unmagnetized , @xmath39 , the seed field is exponentially amplified by the kinematic turbulent dynamo inductive action .",
    "the kinematic dynamo builds the field up to approximately @xmath34 , when the plasma becomes magnetized , @xmath36 .",
    "the time scale of the kinematic dynamo is very short , it is of the order of the smallest eddy turnover time ( kulsrud 1997 ) , @xmath40  million years , which is much smaller than the gravitational collapse time of the protogalaxy , several billion years . the main assumption of the kinematic dynamo theory and , basically , the strict definition of it , are that the growing magnetic field stays so weak , that it does not affect the fluid motions , i.  e.  that there is no _ the back reaction _ of the field on the turbulence .",
    "the results we obtain in this paper reduce to those of the kinematic dynamo theory in the limit of very weak field strengths ( i.  e.  when the plasma is unmagnetized , and there is no the back reaction ) .",
    "the third stage starts when the field grows above @xmath41 , the ion cyclotron time in the magnetic field becomes shorter than the ion collision time , and the plasma becomes strongly magnetized . during this stage",
    "the magnetic field strongly affects the dynamics of the turbulent motions on the viscous scales  ] , by completely changing the viscosity ( see section  [ dynamos ] ) , despite the fact that the magnetic energy is still very small compared to the kinetic energy of the turbulence !",
    "we call this stage as _ the magnetized turbulent dynamo_. in previous theories this stage has not been recognized . the main goal of this paper is to construct a theoretical model for it .",
    "the time scale of the magnetized dynamo is about the same as the kinematic dynamo time scale , @xmath40  million years .",
    "so far the field scale is of the order of the viscous scale or less , and the magnetic field is incoherent in space .",
    "the fourth stage starts when the magnetic field strength grows above @xmath42 .",
    "the field energy becomes comparable to the kinetic energy of the smallest turbulent eddies , and the lorentz forces become dynamically important in the plasma . during this stage",
    "the turbulent motions are dissipated by the growing field , the turbulent energy spectrum becomes truncated at larger and larger scales , and the turbulent energy is eventually transferred into a large - scale strong magnetic field with its energy comparable to the kinetic energy of the fluid motions on the largest scales in the protogalaxy ( which is approximately the same as the thermal energy ) .",
    "this process ( which is still under debate ) is called the inverse cascade ( vainshtein 1982 ; kulsrud & anderson 1992 ; beck 1996 ; kulsrud 2000 ) .",
    "we discuss it qualitatively in section  [ discussion ] . the time scale available for the inverse cascade process is of the order of the largest eddy turnover time , @xmath37  billion years .    the turbulent dynamos and the inverse cascade may not have time to amplify the field up to microgauss values , which are observed in galaxies .",
    "a crucial question is how far they go ?",
    "this paper addresses this question and is concerned with the rate of the magnetic field built up by the magnetized turbulent dynamo .    finally , the fifth stage is the galactic dynamo , which happens in the differentially rotating galactic disc after the galaxy is formed .",
    "this process modifies the strong field that was initially built up in the protogalaxy , on a time scale of the order of the rotation time of the galaxy , @xmath43  million years .",
    "the galactic dynamo theory is not discussed in this paper .    in section  [ dynamos ]",
    "we formulate the basic equations of the magnetized dynamo theory . in section  [ velocities ]",
    "we calculate the statistical correlation functions for turbulent velocities , @xmath44 , in a strongly magnetized plasma by making use of the quasilinear expansion in time of the mhd equations for both the velocities and the magnetic field , similar to the expansion used by kulsrud and anderson ( 1992 ) .",
    "we find that , contrary to the kolmogorov velocities , the turbulent velocities in the magnetized plasma are strongly anisotropic on the viscous scale , as one might expect , because the magnetic field sets `` a preferred axis in space '' . in our calculations",
    "we make two working hypotheses .",
    "first , we assume that for the purpose of magnetic energy calculation , the tensor @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the field unit vector , can be taken to be constant in space in the beginning of the expansion in time .",
    "this is our first hypothesis , which basically relies on our assumption that in the magnetized turbulent dynamo case the magnetic field has a folding structure similar to the one that exists in the kinematic turbulent dynamo case ( see figure  [ figure_folding ] ; maron & cowley 2001 ; schekochihin 2002 ) .",
    "second , we find that there are velocity modes which are not damped by the braginskii viscous forces and , therefore , are divergent unless we incorporate the mhd non - linear inertial terms into our quasilinear expansion .",
    "we assume that these non - linear terms , which limit the divergent velocity modes by coupling them to other modes , may be included into our theory by allowing for rotation of velocity vectors relative to the magnetic field unit vectors  .",
    "this is our second hypothesis . in section  [ magnetic_spectrum ]",
    "we use the correlation functions for the turbulent velocities found in section  [ velocities ] to calculate the evolution of the magnetic energy in the magnetized turbulent plasma .",
    "we start with calculations of the total magnetic energy growth rate in subsection  [ magnetic_energy ] . in subsection  [ mode_coupling_equation ]",
    "we derive the integro - differential mode coupling equation for the magnetic energy spectrum .",
    "our mode coupling equation is a more general version of the corresponding equation of kulsrud and anderson ( 1992 ) , obtained for the kinematic dynamo . in subsection  [ small_scales ]",
    "we consider the magnetic energy spectrum on small subviscous scales . on these scales",
    "the mode coupling equation greatly simplifies and becomes a homogeneous differential equation .",
    "finally , in section  [ discussion ] we give our conclusions .",
    "we also discuss the peculiarities of the inverse cascade in a strongly magnetized turbulent plasma .",
    "hereafter we consider the magnetized turbulent dynamo stage , the shaded region in figure  [ figure_field_scales ] . during this stage",
    "the plasma is strongly magnetized , @xmath47 , but the magnetic energy is still small compared to the turbulent kinetic energy , and therefore , the magnetic lorentz forces can be neglected .",
    "the viscous forces acting on turbulent velocities @xmath44 in a strongly magnetized incompressible fully ionized plasma are determined by the braginskii viscosity stress tensor ( braginskii 1965 ) , _ = -(3__- _ ) _ _ v _ , , [ pi ] where @xmath48 is the unit vector along the magnetic field .",
    "note , that this stress tensor depends on the field unit vector , but is independent of the magnetic strength ( as long as the plasma is strongly magnetized , and @xmath47 ) .",
    "thus , during the magnetized turbulent dynamo stage the magnetic field strongly affects the turbulent motions on the viscous scales by changing the viscous forces , even though the lorentz forces are negligible .",
    "the mhd equations for the turbulent velocities @xmath44 in an incompressible strongly magnetized plasma , neglecting the lorentz forces , are ( landau & lifshitz 1984 ) _",

    "we use @xmath51 , and spatial derivatives are assumed to be taken with respect to all indices that are listed after `` @xmath52 '' signs  , and @xmath53 . ] . to obtain the second line of equation  ( [ equation_for_v ] ) ,",
    "we use formula  ( [ pi ] ) for the viscous stress and incorporate the isotropic part of the stress into the pressure @xmath54 .",
    "it is difficult to solve equations  ( [ equation_for_v ] ) and  ( [ div_v ] ) directly because they are very complicated .",
    "we also do not know the exact expression of the driving force @xmath49 , but its statistics is the same as for an unmagnetized plasma .",
    "therefore , let us proceed as follows .",
    "we represent @xmath49 by introducing subsidiary incompressible turbulent velocities @xmath55 which , by definition , satisfy equations _ t u_&= & -p_,+f_+(1/5)u_-(u_u _ ) _ , , [ equation_for_u ] + u _ , & = & 0 , [ div_u ] where @xmath56 .",
    "( @xmath55 will be essentially the kolmogorov turbulent velocities . )",
    "let us analyze and compare equations  ( [ equation_for_v ] ) and  ( [ equation_for_u ] ) .",
    "first , if for the moment we formally average the braginskii viscosity term @xmath57 in equation  ( [ equation_for_v ] ) over all directions of an isotropic magnetic field , then it reduces to @xmath58 , which coincides with the isotropic viscosity term in equation  ( [ equation_for_u ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 could be considered as an _ effective reduced viscosity _ for an incompressible fully ionized plasma in the presence of a magnetic field that is isotropically tangled on subviscous scales . in other words , the braginskii viscous forces `` are doing worse '' at dissipating the turbulent motions , as compared with the standard isotropic viscous forces in a field - free plasma .",
    "second , note that equations  ( [ equation_for_v ] ) and  ( [ equation_for_u ] ) have the same driving force @xmath49 . by taking the driving force to be the same , we assume that this force comes from larger turbulent eddies .",
    "these larger eddies are on scales larger than the viscous scales , and therefore , these eddies `` do not know '' whether the viscous forces are of the braginskii type or of the standard isotropic type .",
    "now , note that equation  ( [ equation_for_u ] ) is a familiar hydrodynamic equation with a standard isotropic viscosity term .",
    "however , is has a reduced molecular viscosity , @xmath60 instead of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we assume that the solution of equations  ( [ equation_for_u ] ) and  ( [ div_u ] ) is the incompressible , homogeneous , isotropic and stationary kolmogorov turbulence with the effective reduced viscosity _ eff=(1/5 ) .",

    "this model of straight magnetic field lines is not as artificial as it seems at first glance , because of the following arguments .",
    "first , it is known that in the kinematic turbulent dynamo case the magnetic field lines have a folding pattern , shown in figure  [ figure_folding ] , ( schekochihin 2002 ; maron & cowley 2001 ) .",
    "this folding pattern implies that in the bulk of the volume the field is strong and has small curvature , @xmath110 ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the wave numbers parallel and perpendicular to the field lines ) , while in a small fraction of the volume the field is weak and curved , @xmath113 .",
    "the regions of weak and curved field , region  ii in figure  [ figure_folding ] , can be disregarded as long as we consider the volume averaged magnetic field energy and are not interested in the field curvature . as for the regions of strong magnetic field with small curvature , region",
    "i in figure  [ figure_folding ] , the field lines in these regions can be well approximated by the straight field lines on scales @xmath68 which satisfy @xmath114 .",
    "now , we make assumption that even for the magnetized turbulent dynamo case the magnetic field has a folding structure similar to that for the kinematic turbulent dynamo case",
    ". this assumption will be our _ first working hypothesis_. it is based on the simulations of maron and cowley ( 2001 ) , who found good indications for the magnetic field folding pattern in their numerical simulations of mhd turbulence with the braginskii viscosity .",
    "unfortunately , our calculational methods are not adequate to theoretically justify our first working hypothesis because of complications of the field curvature calculations .",
    "however , there exist a simple _ reductio ad absurdum _ theoretical argument , supporting the hypothesis , which is as follows .",
    "if the magnetic field were not folded , i.  e.  if @xmath115 everywhere in space , then the field would be isotropically tangled on viscous and subviscous scales . in this case the braginskii viscosity could be averaged over the field direction , and it should quickly reduce to the isotropic effective viscosity @xmath116 [ see eq .",
    "( [ nu_eff ] ) ] . as a result , in this case the magnetized dynamo should possess the properties of the kinematic dynamo with this effective viscosity , and would develop the folding structure of the magnetic field lines .",
    "note that at a given fixed spatial point of the eulerian system of coordinates the field curvature changes in time .",
    "thus , even if the field is initially straight at this point , it may not remain straight in the future .",
    "in other words , as time goes on , sometimes the spatial point belongs to a region i and sometimes to a region ii ( this reflects the time intermittency and spatial convection of the curvature ) .",
    "however , we are not interested in the magnetic energy evolution at each point of space , but instead , we are interested in the evolution of the total ( spatially averaged ) magnetic energy . therefore ,",

    "this is our _ second working hypothesis_. note , that the @xmath96 term is isotropic , and therefore , it damps not only the divergent velocity modes , perpendicular to the field vector , but all velocity modes .",
    "this is not a serious problem though , because the rotational damping is smaller than the braginskii damping by a factor @xmath161 [ see eq .",
    "( [ omega_damp ] ) ] , and our results should be valid within a factor of order unity .",

    "note , that according to equations  ( [ gamma_result ] ) and  ( [ gamma_lambda_result ] ) , the growth rate of the green s function , @xmath268 , is approximately equal to a half of the growth rate of the total magnetic energy ( the latter one is @xmath269 ) .",
    "in this paper we have developed a theoretical basis for the magnetized turbulent dynamo , which operates in protogalaxies , where the plasma is fully ionized , and the viscosity is the braginskii tensor viscosity .",
    "the results of the kinematic dynamo theory , already seem to support the primordial ( protogalactic ) dynamo origin of cosmic magnetic fields ( kulsrud 1997 ) .",
    "the results that we have obtained for the magnetized dynamo , further support this primordial origin theory .",
    "this is because the number of the magnetic energy e - foldings during the magnetized turbulent dynamo stage in a protogalaxy , given by equation  ( [ gamma_collapse_time ] ) , is up to ten time larger than that in the kinematic dynamo theory .",
    "this number of e - foldings is more than large enough for the magnetic field in the protogalaxy to grow from its seed value , provided by the biermann battery , up to the field - turbulence energy equipartition value .",
    "the number of e - foldings of the magnetic energy on the viscous scale , which is determined by the growth rate @xmath268 of the green s function  ( [ greens_function ] ) , is less by one half , but it is still sufficiently large  ) ([gamma_ratio ] ) for the magnetic energy growth rate are sensitive to the value of the physical parameter @xmath97 , which is estimated in equation  ( [ omega_damp ] ) .",
    "we also left out the finite time correlation effects .",
    "therefore , our result for the number of magnetic energy e - foldings should be viewed as an estimate , valid within a factor of order two . however , it is important that the number of e - foldings , which we found , is a very large number . ] .",
    "another our prediction is that the tail of the magnetic energy spectrum on small subviscous scales increases with the wave number as @xmath270 [ see the green s function  ( [ greens_function ] ) ] , instead of @xmath267 in the kinematic theory  , as long as @xmath271 . ] .",
    "therefore , in the magnetized dynamo the magnetic energy is slightly shifted to larger scales as compared to the kinematic dynamo case .",
    "the green s function solution  ( [ greens_function ] ) indicates that in the magnetized dynamo theory the magnetic energy tends to quickly propagate to very small subviscous scales , similar to the kinematic dynamo case .",
    "on the other hand , the observed cosmic fields have rather large correlation lengths .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field lines must be unwrapped on small scales by the lorentz tension forces , while the field energy is transferred and amplified on larger scales during the inverse cascade stage .",
    "this most important and most interesting stage happens when the magnetic field energy is comparable to the turbulent kinetic energy . in the final part of this paper",
    "let us discuss the significance of the braginskii viscosity for the inverse cascade in more details .",
    "first , note that the theory of the inverse cascade in a plasma with the regular isotropic ( non - braginskii ) viscosity has a difficulty of unwrapping of the small - scale magnetic field lines .",
    "this difficulty can be understood as follows  .",
    "the equation for the turbulent velocities @xmath44 in the plasma with the isotropic viscosity , including the lorentz forces , is ( landau & lifshitz 1984 ) _",
    "t v_&= & -p_,+f_+v_+(1/4)(*b * ) b_-(*v*)v_[equation_for_u_lorents_forces ] .",
    "we can estimate the unwrapping velocity , @xmath272 , by fourier transforming equation  ( [ equation_for_u_lorents_forces ] ) in space , @xmath90 , and then balancing the viscous and the inertial forces against the magnetic tension force .",
    "the isotropic viscosity dominates on small scales , and we have k^2 v_unwrap ~(1/4)k_b^2 , v_unwrap ~(k_/k)(k_/k)(v_a^2/k _ ) v_a , [ unwrapping_velocity ] where @xmath273 is the alfven speed . at the time of the field - turbulence energy equipartition on the viscous scale , the alfven speed is @xmath274 , and before this equipartition @xmath275 . since in the kinematic dynamo theory",
    "the field lines have a folding pattern , @xmath276 ( see fig .  [ figure_folding ] ) , the unwrapping velocity  ( [ unwrapping_velocity ] ) is small compared to the alfven speed , even at the equipartition time . in other words , since @xmath277 at the energy equipartition , then @xmath278 ( here @xmath269 is the magnetic energy growth rate ) , and the unwrapping rate , @xmath279 , is much smaller than @xmath186 .",
    "this means that the field continues to grow on the viscous and subviscous scales even beyond the energy equipartition .",
    "however , in the case of the magnetized turbulent dynamo the viscosity term in equation  ( [ equation_for_u_lorents_forces ] ) is modified , and the anti - unwrapping argument does not apply . indeed , the field unwrapping velocity is parallel and varies in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the large velocity gradient perpendicular to the field lines , which leads to a large perpendicular stress in the isotropic viscosity case , is suppressed in the case of the braginskii viscous forces ( because the transfer of the ion momentum in the perpendicular direction is inhibited ) .",
    "therefore , in the magnetized dynamo theory @xmath280 at the equipartition , and the magnetic field strength saturates on the viscous and subviscous scales . as a result , the braginskii viscosity makes the inverse cascade of the magnetic energy more likely , because the larger turbulent eddies do not need to deliver their energy to the field on the viscous and subviscous scales  ( kulsrud 2000 ) .",

    "<S> the prevailing theory for the origin of cosmic magnetic fields is that they have been amplified to their present values by the turbulent dynamo inductive action in the protogalactic and galactic medium . up to now , in calculation of the turbulent dynamo , it has been customary to assume that there is no back reaction of the magnetic field on the turbulence , as long as the magnetic energy is less than the turbulent kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption leads to the kinematic dynamo theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , the applicability of this theory to protogalaxies is rather limited . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that in protogalaxies the temperature is very high , and the viscosity is dominated by magnetized ions . as the magnetic field strength grows in time , the ion cyclotron time becomes shorter than the ion collision time , and the plasma becomes strongly magnetized . as a result , the ion viscosity becomes the braginskii viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in protogalaxies the back reaction sets in much earlier , at field strengths much lower than those which correspond to field - turbulence energy equipartition , and the turbulent dynamo becomes what we call the magnetized turbulent dynamo . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we lay the theoretical groundwork for the magnetized turbulent dynamo . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we predict that the magnetic energy growth rate in the magnetized dynamo theory is up to ten time larger than that in the kinematic dynamo theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly discuss how the braginskii viscosity can aid the development of the inverse cascade of magnetic energy after the energy equipartition is reached . </S>"
