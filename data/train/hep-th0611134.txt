    "the interaction of charged spin-1/2 fermions with electromagnetic fields is described by the minimal coupling in the form of dirac equation .",
    "one of the interesting phenomena with strong electromagnetic fields is particle production .",
    "a well known example is the schwinger process , in which minimally interacting charged particles are created in pairs in strong electric fields @xcite . in a purely magnetic field configuration",
    ", however , it has been shown that the production of minimally interacting fermion is not possible even with a spatial inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the pair production of minimally interacting particles is considered to be a purely electric effect .",
    "pauli introduced a non - minimal coupling of spin-1/2 particles with electromagnetic fields , which can be interpreted as an effective interaction of fermions with an anomalous magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "for the neutral fermions with non - vanishing magnetic moments , it is the pauli interaction through which the electromagnetic interaction can be probed .",
    "it is interesting to note that the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field , which couples directly to the magnetic dipole moment through the pauli interaction , plays a similar role analogous to the electric field for a charged particles with the minimal coupling .",
    "the possibility of production of the neutral fermions in a purely magnetic field configuration with spatial inhomogeneity has been demonstrated in 2 + 1 dimension @xcite , and recently the production rate in 3 + 1 dimension has been calculated explicitly for the magnetic fields with a spatial inhomogeneity of a critical value @xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to discuss further the possibility of the fermion production under a uniform magnetic field when it becomes stronger than the critical field whose strength is the ratio of the fermion mass to its magnetic moment .",
    "we consider a neutral fermion but with a magnetic moment @xmath1 with pauli interaction .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of the fermion is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the longitudinal and the transversal momentum to the magnetic field direction .",
    "one can see that , for a critical magnetic field @xmath5 , the energy gap between the positive and the negative energy states disappears .",
    "this indicates the possible instability of magnetic field configurations even in uniform magnetic fields .",
    "we have calculated the effective potential of uniform magnetic fields which interact with spin-1/2 fermions through the pauli interaction . for a magnetic field weaker than the critical field ,",
    "the effective potential is real as expected .",
    "however , for a magnetic field stronger than the critical field , it is found that the imaginary part of the effective potential does not vanish .",
    "this implies that a uniform magnetic field becomes unstable to produce the fermion pairs in vacuum when it is stronger than the critical field .",
    "it should be noted that the pair production in uniform magnetic fields is not due to the tunneling process as in schwinger process overcoming the energy gap , @xmath6 , but due to the disappearance of the energy gap in eq.([energy ] ) for the critical field strength .",
    "the difference is also manifested in different functional forms of the pair production rates .",
    "it is found that the production rate takes a quartic form which is quite different from the exponential form of schwinger process .",
    "the calculation of the effective potential for uniform magnetic fields induced by a neutral fermion , which is assumed to be interacting with background electromagnetic field through pauli coupling , is discussed in section ii and the results are summarized in section iii .",

    "this indicates the possible instability of magnetic field configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy eigenvalues of minimally interacting charged fermions without an anomalous magnetic moment are @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are spin projections along the magnetic field @xcite . it should be pointed out that zero energy states do not exist even for a strong magnetic field and no particle production of minimally interacting fermions in pure magnetic fields can be attributed to this finite energy gap @xcite .",
