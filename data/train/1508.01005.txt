    "copper is a material which has accompanied human pre - history and history , and it is still highly relevant today .",
    "cold working of copper has been performed for at least @xmath1 years and smelting of copper ore for around @xmath2 years  @xcite .",
    "its use as construction materials , _",
    "e.g. _ in piping , can be dated back to ancient egypt , and its importance in this field has not diminished nowadays . in the modern world",
    "it has acquired further uses , for example in electrical systems and electronic devices .    within this long history ,",
    "the properties of copper have been extensively studied and exploited , however much is still unknown about this important metal . in particular , the oxidation and corrosion of copper , which impacts its performance in industrial and technological applications , is still not completely understood .",
    "copper is found to readily oxidise at room temperature  @xcite , and the presence of an oxide layer , however thin , can compromise its uses in technology . as an example , copper could be an environmentally friendly and low - cost substitute for the ( currently used ) tin - lead or ( promising ) gold- and silver - based solder alloys in electronic packaging , if there was a way to prevent its oxidation  @xcite .",
    "moreover , copper canisters are used for nuclear waste disposal , and understanding the oxidation and corrosion of copper in anaerobic conditions is thus really important  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of stable copper oxides at room temperature , with a @xmath3 ev band gap , makes them interesting for catalytic  @xcite , gas sensing  @xcite , optoelectronic and solar technologies  @xcite .",
    "thus , there currently is a two - fold interest in understanding copper oxides : from the one hand , to mitigate against technological failure , on the other hand , to exploit their potential industrial applications .",
    "copper is considered a model system to understand the formation of metal oxides in general .",
    "the atomistic details of the oxidation process tend to be system - specific , with some metals showing uniform oxide growth ( _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) , other complex temperature - dependent phenomena such as surface roughening ( _ e.g. _ ref .  @xcite ) and island formation ( _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the copper oxidation process is one of the most studied with a large number of experimental and computational methods , and one of the better understood .",
    "therefore , a detailed understanding of copper oxidation , of the techniques used to study it and of the challenges which are still open is invaluable when considering the oxidation process on any other system .    in this review ,",
    "we discuss the status of knowledge of copper oxidation from the atomistic point of view , which we believe is of key importance if we want to learn how to prevent or manipulate copper oxidation .",
    "we can not hope to provide a complete review of all the work done on this subject since the beginning of the last century  @xcite .",
    "we are therefore only going to focus on recent surface science , spectroscopy and atomistic computational work which has been performed to understand the properties of copper oxides and their formation , and on the open challenges that can be addressed using these techniques .",
    "first , a brief overview on the experimental and computational techniques which have been used for the study of oxide structures and oxidation kinetics is given ( sec .",
    "[ techniques ] ) , in order to clarify some of the terminology used throughout the review .",
    "the structural and electronic characteristics of the bulk oxides and their surfaces are then presented ( sec .  [ oxide_structures ] ) .",
    "we subsequently look at the interaction of clean copper surfaces with oxygen and the initial stages of controlled oxidation ( sec .  [ o_ads ] ) as well as",
    "long - term oxidation ( sec .  [ controlled ] ) . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , conclusions and perspectives are given .",
    "we hope that it will be clear from the following that tremendous progress has been made in understanding the atomistic details of copper oxides and their formation under different conditions .",
    "however , equally important gaps in our understanding remain , especially in terms of the formation kinetics and the structure of the resulting oxide surfaces .",
    "an enormous number of experimental  @xcite and computational techniques are available to investigate the physical and chemical characteristics of solids , surfaces and surface kinetic processes .",
    "many of them have been used over the years to _",
    "e.g. _ , understand oxide structures , characterize oxide surfaces , understand the oxidation kinetics and investigate bulk properties of the oxides . for clarity , in this section",
    "we provide a brief introduction to the most relevant techniques which have been used on copper oxide and which are going to be mentioned in the following sections , with an emphasis on strengths and weaknesses of each approach .    in early studies of oxidation , thermogravimetric analysis ( tga ) ,",
    "where changes in physical and chemical properties of materials are measured as a function of time , has been widely used to study the onset of oxidation by recording the mass gain of a sample under oxygen exposure . whilst useful in providing a broad overview of the extent of oxidation ,",
    "this technique is however unable to provide atom - resolved information .",
    "imaging techniques such as electron microscopy ( em ) , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) and their derivatives ( _ e.g. _ , high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) or field emission scanning electron microscopy ( fesem ) ) and surface - specific techniques such as scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) can be applied to surfaces and provide atomistic level structural information . as we will see , they have been amply used to image adsorption of oxygen on the copper surface , surface reconstructions and initial oxide formation . the atomic composition and oxidation states of the atoms in a material can be obtained using spectroscopic techniques such as x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) , electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) , low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) , reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) , x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps or esca ) and x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) .",
    "the space- and time - resolution of these techniques has greatly improved since they were first used in this field ( in the 1980s ) , as well as their range of applicability : for example , experiments at relatively high pressures can be performed nowadays  @xcite .",
    "growth of the oxide and its atomic composition has been extensively studied by means of ellipsometry .",
    "this technique measures changes in polarization as light interacts with an object and the resulting data are fitted with a ` guess ' model for the material ( _ e.g. _ a two - layer cu@xmath0o / cu model or a three - layer cuo / cu@xmath0o / cu one ) .",
    "computer simulations have also been widely applied to study the structural , optical and vibrational characteristics of copper oxides . when carrying out simulations of materials at the atomic scale , classical empirical potentials ( force fields ) or more sophisticated quantum ( _ ab initio _ ) approaches , such as density functional theory ( dft ) , can be used .",
    "force fields are parametrised empirical potentials tuned to reproduce the interactions of the atoms in the system at hand . for certain problems",
    "force fields can provide a faithful description .",
    "however , the reliability and transferability of such calculations depends primarily on the extent and quality of the data used in their construction .",
    "moreover , force fields can not generally be applied to study chemical reactions .",
    "current development in force fields are addressing these issues .",
    "indeed , parametrisations obtained by fitting large data sets using _",
    "e.g. _ , neural network  @xcite and machine learning methods  @xcite , to name just two , are improving accuracy and transferability .",
    "moreover , bond order potentials ( such as reaxff  @xcite ) and polarisable force fields  @xcite are making it possible to simulate chemical reactions .",
    "it is difficult to make general statements about the sizes of systems that can be explored with various methods .",
    "however , with many standard force fields it is now possible to examine systems with @xmath4 atoms on a routine basis .",
    "in addition , it is possible to explore the evolution of a system of this size , again on a routine basis , with an approach such as molecular dynamics for several hundreds of nanoseconds .",
    "more accurate approaches are _ ab initio _ methods which aim to study the structure and properties of a material by seeking ( approximate ) solutions to quantum mechanical equations such as the many - electron , many - atom schroedinger equation .",
    "these methods are more general and do not require system - specific parametrisations , however they are computationally more expensive .",
    "one of the most widely used methods to study the properties of bulk materials and surfaces is density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "with dft it is possible to make genuine predictions about structural properties of a material within a few percent of the experimental value .",
    "dft also provides access to the electronic structure of the systems being considered and related spectroscopic properties . in dft , the energy of the electronic system is determined from the electronic density by solving schroedinger - like equations . whilst exact in principle , in practice approximations have to be introduced since the functional form of the electron - electron interaction , called the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional , is unknown .",
    "many approximate xc functionals have been developed  @xcite , the most common ones being the local density approximation ( lda ) and the generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "a number of deficiencies in dft arise from these approximations and the choice of an appropriate xc functional is critical in order to obtain meaningful results . as an example , in strongly correlated systems like cuo ( typically , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals are localised ) , the gga and lda functionals provide a poor description of the electronic and bulk crystal structure .",
    "moreover , the band gap obtained using gga or lda in semiconductors or insulators is generally underestimated . in these cases it is possible to add simple but somewhat _ ad hoc _ corrections to the functionals ( _ e.g. _ the hubbard u  @xcite , self - interaction correction sic  @xcite ) or to use more sophisticated hybrid functionals ( _ e.g. _ hse06  @xcite , pbe0  @xcite ) which incorporate some exact hartree - fock exchange . compared to standard empirical potential methods ,",
    "dft is much more computationally demanding , and , on a routine basis , systems with only a few 100 atoms can be examined and the dynamics of such systems explored for only a few tens of picoseconds .",
    "other computational methods which have been used in copper oxide simulations are the gw method  @xcite , used when optoelectronic properties are of interest , since it is more accurate at predicting band structures than standard dft xc functionals .",
    "in addition there have been a number of hartree - fock  @xcite studies and calculations with simpler approaches , such as the linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) and tight binding methods  @xcite .",
    "we are going to introduce here the bulk and surface structures of the two main copper oxides , cu@xmath0o and cuo .",
    "knowledge of the physical properties of these materials , and especially of the surface structures , is relevant background when trying to understand the formation and growth of the copper oxide .",
    "the two most common forms of the oxide ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oxide_str ] ) are cuprite ( or cuprous oxide , cu@xmath0o ) , the principal oxide at low temperatures and pressure , and tenorite ( or cupric oxide , cuo ) , dominant at high temperatures and pressures  @xcite . another copper oxide structure , paramelaconite ( cu@xmath7o@xmath8 ) , exists as a rare mineral found in hydrothermal deposits of copper .",
    "cuprite has long been known to be the primary oxide for copper at ambient conditions and there is considerable interest in its application to catalysis , optoelectronics and gas sensing and therefore a large amount of work has been done to determine its physical and chemical characteristics .",
    "tenorite has been studied less and still relatively little is understood about the structure of its surfaces , with only a handful of experimental and computational studies performed to that aim .",

    "it is a @xmath10-type semiconductor with a direct band gap of @xmath11 ev and an optical gap of 2.62 ev  @xcite .",
    "it is a promising material for a variety of industrial applications because of its band gap and because it shows negative thermal expansion  @xcite .",
    "the properties of cuprous oxide have been extensively studied using empirical potentials  @xcite , tight binding  @xcite and _ ab initio _ methods . _",
    "ab initio _ studies include the use of dft methods ( see table  [ table : cu2o ] ) , and good agreement with the experimental bulk structure ( _ i.e. _ no more than @xmath12 discrepancy between the calculated and experimental value of the lattice constant ) and vibrational modes  @xcite have been found .",
    "however , the band gap is underestimated with standard dft xc functionals , yielding values between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ev  @xcite and grossly overestimated with hartree - fock methods at 9.7 ev  @xcite .",
    "corrections to dft ( _ e.g. _ dft+u or the gw approximation applied to dft - gga ) give rise to band gaps that are in better agreement with experiment  @xcite , as summarised in table  [ table : cu2o ] .",

    "information on the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional is also given .",
    "pbe is a type of gga functional .",
    "scgw , g0w0 and gw+v@xmath17 are different applications of the gw method .",

    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      a number of studies have tried to establish the role of surface defects on the nucleation of the oxide , in order to understand whether island nucleation is a heterogeneous process , triggered by specific surface features , or a homogeneous process . while some metals and semimetals can grow oxide layers homogeneously without the aid of impurities or surface defects ( such as ru(0001 )  @xcite , ag(110 )  @xcite or si(111 )  @xcite ) it has been shown that other metals , like pb  @xcite or ge(111 )  @xcite , can not oxidise without the presence of surface features ( impurities or defects ) which trigger the dissociation of o@xmath0 molecules .    for copper",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that defect sites play a role in oxide island nucleation .",
    "grain boundaries  @xcite , vacancy islands  @xcite and the edges of pits  @xcite are found to be nucleating sites for island formation , however no preferential nucleation sites have been found at dislocations , stacking faults or impurities  @xcite .",
    "the importance of step edges was initially inferred by milne and howie  @xcite , and it was then demonstrated on cu(111 ) by means of stm and tem  @xcite . however , tem work by yang  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that this is not the case on cu(100 ) and cu(110 ) films .",
    "it is indeed possible , considering the different nature of oxide formation on the three low - index surfaces , that different defects play a more or less important role in different oxide nucleation conditions .",
    "more work is needed to clarify further the correlation between defect sites and oxide formation and remove doubts on whether small , non - structured dislocations and impurities have a role in the nucleation of copper oxide islands , and , from a theory point of view , why some type of defects seem more efficient at nucleating oxide islands than others .",
    "cuo is expected to form after exposure of a copper surface to oxygen at high temperatures and pressure  @xcite .",
    "much work has gone into understanding high temperature oxidation of copper ( @xmath18 ) and it has been recently reviewed  @xcite .",
    "most work shows the growth of cuo on top of cu@xmath0o , following a parabolic rate law for the thickness as a function of time .",
    "however , no studies of the atomistic details of the formation of cuo at high temperatures have been performed to date .    in controlled conditions , evidence of a cuo overlayer",
    "was found by exposing a cu sample to a controlled flow of o@xmath0 at high pressure and the dependence of oxidation on oxygen pressure was analysed .",
    "boggio  @xcite investigated the pressure dependence ( @xmath19 torr ) on the oxidation of cu(111 ) , and in particular the film thickness , using ellipsometry .",
    "the film growth ( thought to be cu@xmath0o ) , after @xmath20 minutes exposure at @xmath21 , was related to the cabrera - mott expression of growth .",
    "however , a dramatic decrease in the oxidation rate with increased oxygen pressure was observed and related to the formation of a passivating cuo film at the oxide - oxygen interface .",
    "pierson  @xcite _ et al .",
    "_ looked at the reactivity of a number of noble metals when subject to a flow of gases . in the case of cu in an o@xmath0 flow , the formation of oxidised structures was found to depend on the flow rate of o@xmath0 .",
    "the formation of cu@xmath0o ( at oxygen partial pressure p(o@xmath0)=@xmath22 torr ) , cuo ( p(o@xmath0)=@xmath23 torr ) and metastable cu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( p(o@xmath0)=@xmath24 torr ) , was observed by xrd analysis .",
    "the oxidation of copper and the physical properties of the resulting oxides are fundamental scientific problems which are still not completely understood today . since there has currently been a surge of interest in the use of copper oxide for catalysis , optoelectronics and gas sensing , the need for a detailed understanding of the surface structures of these oxides has become even more pressing .",
    "in addition , uncontrolled copper oxidation is still an issue in _",
    "e.g. _ electronic applications , and understanding the oxide growth process is the first step towards mitigating it .    in this review we have discussed the state of the knowledge regarding the structure and formation of copper oxides and we have seen that the structural , optic and vibrational characteristics of bulk copper oxides are well understood . a good amount of computational work ( mainly from dft ) has been performed on both cu@xmath0o and cuo , providing important information on the structures of the surfaces at different temperature and pressure conditions . a hexagonal structure presenting cu surface vacancies was found to be the most stable on cu@xmath0o and the stoichiometric ( 111 ) surface was the most stable for cuo .",
    "few experimental studies are available to either confirm or disprove these suggestions from theory .",
    "considering the potential technological applications of these oxides , this is an area which should be looked at more with experimental techniques such as stm , xps or leed .",
    "many atomistic aspects of the formation of the oxides have been established .",
    "indeed , the oxygen - induced surface reconstructions on copper surfaces with low miller index are well known .",
    "in addition , stm studies have revealed certain atomic level details of the initial stages of cu surface oxidation .",
    "other experiments at low oxygen pressure show that the initial oxide growth happens through the formation of cuprous oxide islands which eventually coalesce .",
    "the kinetics of the oxide formation depends on the temperature and on the copper surface and it is dominated by oxygen surface diffusion and direct impingement in the first instance , and after coalescence by oxygen diffusion into the bulk .",
    "there is however scope for further work as many fundamental aspects of copper oxidation are still unclear .",
    "in fact , there is no consensus on how the transition from oxygen - reconstructed copper surfaces to the onset of oxidation occurs , whether this is after the surface has been reconstructed or if the islands start forming on the clean surface .",
    "at least for the case of cu(100 ) and cu(110 ) , there is good evidence that the onset of oxidation will occur after the formation of an o - reconstructed overlayer which affects the growth kinetics of the islands themselves .",
    "the precise understanding of the formation of these copper islands is not only important to understand the onset of oxidation , but also to exploit the oxide islands as nano - templates for technological applications . in order to do that , the precise mechanism of nucleation",
    "needs to be understood .",
    "it is also unclear where the different behaviour between metals such as ag or al , which grow uniform oxide layers , and copper stems from .",
    "the o - induced surface reconstructions of different fcc metals have been extensively studied  @xcite and the differences found in their electronic structures  @xcite or surface configurations  @xcite could provide hints to their different behaviour upon higher exposure to oxygen . however , dedicated theoretical studies to this aim have not been performed so far .",
    "the kinetics of long - term oxide growth , both in controlled conditions and in ambient air is an issue that remains poorly understood .",
    "copper oxide formation does not simply follow the cabrera - mott law , especially at the initial stages when oxide growth is not uniform across the surface .",
    "many studies have been performed in order to establish the oxide formation kinetics at low temperatures , however they are difficult to compare to one another , because of the different conditions in use . indeed temperature ,",
    "humidity , oxygen partial pressure , structure of the initial copper film / coupon , the presence of defects and impurities seem to affect the growth of the oxide as well as the final oxide product .",
    "moreover , the structure of copper oxide when grown in ambient air , which is very important to the practical uses of copper , is still not clearly understood , with the formation of a cuo overlayer on top of a cu@xmath0o layer still being debated .",
    "further systematic experimental studies , looking at disentagling the environmental factors influencing oxide growth are needed .",
    "computationally , additional studies of copper and copper oxide surfaces and their interaction with the environment ( _ e.g. _ water , o@xmath0 , n@xmath0 ) would provide valuable information in support of the experimental work .",
    "work in this direction has recently been reported , _",
    "e.g. _ water and hydroxide adsorption on cu and cu oxide  @xcite .",
    "part of the challenges that have been faced by scientists in studying these systems are due to the limitations of theoretical and experimental technology available to them .",
    "it is indeed clear that massive steps forward have been made since the first calorimetry experiments on cu@xmath0o crystals , and nanometre scale resolution has been obtained with stm and tem and structural atomistic structures can be explored with xps and leed .",
    "moreover , development of experimental techniques , such as x - ray lasers with extremely high spatial and temporal resolution  @xcite or near - ambient pressure photoelectron spectroscopy  @xcite might enable mechanisms of initial stages of oxidation to be explored .",
    "computational techniques also present challenges from the point of view of accuracy of calculated structures and physical properties , as well as time length of molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "moreover developments in theory , especially _",
    "ab initio _ molecular dynamics , accelerated sampling techniques and more sophisticated non _ ab initio _ approaches mean that similar studies on the first steps of oxidation are possible . _",
    "ab initio _ molecular dynamics , along with a free energy sampling approach has been used to examine the initial stages of nacl dissolution in liquid water  @xcite : it is not inconceivable that similar techniques could be applied to copper oxidation in ambient and even aqueous conditions .",
    "finally , another important challenge , is bridging the gap between highly controlled studies performed in ultra - high vacuum and work aiming to understand the formation of the oxide in industrially relevant conditions . at the moment",
    ", these two aspects of the oxidation problem are addressed using different techniques at different resolutions . in order to fully understand the oxidation of copper",
    "it is important to be able to relate the results obtained in these different conditions to one another and build a unified picture of the problem .",
