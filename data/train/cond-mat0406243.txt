    "for the observation of clear zeeman splitting in a quantum dot it is crucial to eliminate orbital effects of the magnetic field that can be orders of magnitude larger .",
    "the magnetic field can be applied normal or parallel to the plane of the electron gas .",
    "figure  [ fig2]b shows the conductance of the ring ( gray scale ) as a function of plunger gate voltage @xmath12 ( vertical axis ) and magnetic field ( horizontal axis ) .",
    "the latter was applied normal to the plane of the electron gas for the left panel and parallel for the right panel . in both cases ,",
    "conductance peaks are visible as dark stripes , separated by bright regions of very small conductance .",
    "conductance peaks are numbered consistently throughout this paper .",
    "if the magnetic field is oriented normal to the plane of the ring , conductance peaks show aharonov  bohm - type oscillations periodic with each additional flux quantum @xmath13 penetrating the ring @xcite . states that move up and down in plunger gate as a function of magnetic field are extended around the ring , while those with a weak magnetic field dispersion tend to be localized in one ring arm @xcite .",
    "neighboring peaks oscillating exactly in parallel are strong candidates for spin pairs @xcite , i.e. the same orbital state is successively occupied by spin - up and spin - down .",
    "an example of such a pair is peak 10 and 11 .",
    "raw data showing this pair together with its zeeman splitting was published in ref .",
    "@xcite .    when the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the plane of the ring ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) , individual conductance peaks show a weak parabolic diamagnetic shift to higher plunger gate voltages .",
    "considering the different magnetic field scales for the two orientations it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) that the diamagnetic shift of levels in @xmath14 is about an order of magnitude smaller than the level shift in @xmath15 .",
    "in addition it is found here , in agreement with previous investigations @xcite , that the diamagnetic shift of levels is , with sufficient accuracy , the same for neighbouring conductance peaks .",
    "this property allows the elimination of the diamagnetic shift , if peak spacings are analyzed rather than absolute peak positions .",
    "this is necessary because the expected zeeman splitting in gaas is tiny compared to the orbital effects discussed so far : an estimate using the gaas bulk g - factor gives @xmath16  @xmath17ev / t , where @xmath18 is bohr s magneton .",
    "the peak spacings determined from the parallel field data in fig .  [ fig2](b ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "these peak spacings can be interpreted using @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the spin quantum number of the dot along @xmath14 and @xmath21 is the lever arm of the plunger gate .",
    "differences of successive ground state spins @xmath22 take on half - integer values that can be interpreted as the ` spin of the added electron ' .",
    "the second difference @xmath23 takes on integer values .",
    "the slopes of peak spacings observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) can be classified in the range between 2 and 4  t ( shaded region ) by the three integer values -1 , 0 and 1 as descending , flat and ascending .",
    "the results of an experimental evaluation of the slopes @xmath24 and the @xmath25 values are tabulated in table  [ tab1 ] . some of the slopes , e.g. , ( 11 - 10 ) and ( 6 - 5 ) , are in excellent agreement with the gaas bulk g - factor of -0.44 , and most of them fall into the gray shaded areas d , f , a indicated at the top of fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "the only exceptions are ( 5 - 4 ) and ( 13 - 12 ) . the origin of these fluctuations in the slopes that are also reported by other authors @xcite remain to be investigated . in our case ,",
    "part of the fluctuations could arise due to small differences in lever arms for different states ( @xmath26 ) or due to other states with different spin that are close in energy .    from the knowledge of a series of values @xmath25 ,",
    "series of ground state spins can be generated .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] shows the ground state spins @xmath20 and the added electron spins @xmath27 for the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "it is reassuring to notice that the @xmath27 values are in agreement with two families of @xmath14-dispersions in the raw data in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "peaks with @xmath28 tend to curve upwards , while those with @xmath29 tend to stay flat .",
    "this direct analysis is possible , because the diamagnetic shift of peaks is small in our sample .",
    "the @xmath20-series in table  [ tab1 ] is not unique . other series can be generated by adding a constant integer or half integer to all the given @xmath20 values .",
    "additional information is therefore required to pinpoint the ground state spins uniquely .",
    "it is known from numerical calculations of quantum dots in a similar regime @xcite that ground state spins with @xmath30 are extremely unlikely .",
    "it turns out that this restriction reduces the number of possible ground state spin series to only four , i.e. the one given in table  [ tab1 ] and those where 1/2 , 1 or 3/2 is added to all the given @xmath20-values .",
    ".ground state spins @xmath20 and added electron spins @xmath27 for the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "the values @xmath24 were determined from average slopes of lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) between 2 and 4  t. [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "additional information about the states in the ring can be obtained by applying a finite voltage difference between the two plunger gates to the left and the right of the ring @xcite .",
    "the level spectrum plotted as a function of this ` asymmetry ' @xmath31 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "two types of states can be recognized : states that are extended around the ring have a weak dependence on @xmath31 ( e.g. , states 6,8,10,11 ) while those localized in one arm of the ring depend strongly on @xmath31 ( e.g. , states 4,7,9 ) .",
    "this spectrum allows , together with the @xmath15-data in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , to identify spin pairs .",
    "for example , the extended states 10 and 11 run exactly in parallel as a function of @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) and as a function of @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) and are therefore identified as a spin pair . the same is true for extended states 6 and 8 which do not lead to neighboring conductance peaks at zero asymmetry .",
    "it can be verified in the @xmath27-row of table  [ tab1 ] that each of these spin pairs indeed has one spin - up ( 1/2 ) and one spin - down ( -1/2 ) assigned for the tunneling electron . among the more localized states , 2 and 4",
    "can be called a spin pair owing to their identical slope in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and their @xmath15 behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "in contrast , states 7 and 9 have different slopes ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) , the same spin ( table  [ tab1 ] ) and are therefore not a spin pair .",
    "however , 7 pairs up with 12 and probably also 9 with 14 .",
    "all the spin pairs have the property that @xmath29 is occupied before @xmath28 , because the former is lower in energy . the only remaining unpaired level in the range of our measurement",
    "is 5 . taking the typical spacing between spin pairs into account and considering that state 5 has @xmath28 ,",
    "we conclude that the missing partner for state 5 is lower in energy .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that all states below 5 are paired and that therefore the ground state spin in valley ( 6 - 5 ) is zero . with this assumption ,",
    "the ground state spin series given in table  [ tab1 ] is the one that we favorize among the four possible .",
    "figure  [ fig3]b shows the resulting ground state spin states for the data in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "ev subtracted between neighboring peaks .",
    "( b ) corresponding spin configuration as described in the text.,width=453 ]",
    "it is interesting to note that the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) predicts transitions from @xmath32 to @xmath33 at constant electron number , driven by gate voltages .",
    "such singlet  triplet transitions are interesting in view of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) because the triplet state becomes the ground state due to exchange interactions .",
    "the quantum ring with its states classified as ` extended ' or ` localized ' is in certain respects comparable to a double quantum dot system with states , e.g. , classified as ` left ' or ` right ' .",
    "it has been shown that the magnitude of exchange matrix elements can be extracted from such experiments @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that in the data shown above , the exchange energy is smaller than the broadening of energy levels and can not be observed .",
    "however , in another cooldown of the same sample , a gate - voltage induced singlet ",
    "triplet transition was identified and the exchange energy was extracted @xcite . figure  [ fig4]a shows the measured energy spectrum as a function of plunger gate asymmetry @xmath31 with localized states ( steep ascending slope ) and extended states ( weakly ascending slope ) .",
    "the spectrum can be interpreted as the crossing of two spin - paired levels .",
    "the corresponding spin filling extracted from a similar analysis as that discussed above is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) . tuning the system with gate voltages along the line indicated by",
    "the dashed arrow leads to a singlet  triplet  singlet transition for the uppermost two electrons .",
    "the extracted exchange energy matrix element of 25  @xmath17ev is larger than @xmath34 , but about an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding hartree energies for extended states ( 360  @xmath17ev ) , localized states ( 530  @xmath17ev ) and the hartree energy matrix element for a pair of an extended and a localized state ( 335  @xmath17ev ) that can be extracted @xcite .",
    "triplet transitions have been observed in strong magnetic fields before @xcite .      in conclusion ,",
    "we have shown how the spin states of a coulomb blockaded many - electron quantum ring system can be investigated in great detail .",
    "zeeman splitting of energy levels was observed in an in - plane magnetic field and possible series of spin ground - states were found . using the energy shift of orbital states as a function of perpendicular magnetic field and asymmetric gate voltages , pairs of states with identical orbital wave functions but opposite spins",
    "were identified . using this knowledge ,",
    "the number of plausible sequences of ground state spins could be reduced to only one .",
    "knowing the spin ground states of the ring as a function of experimental parameters , it was possible to identify a gate - voltage induced singlet ",
    "triplet transition .",
